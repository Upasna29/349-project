"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197964231337/recommended/34830/","76561197964231337","[N.o.N] Leftie","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197964231337/","593 products in account","A serious sniping game. Lurking in the bush, finding a good position and placing one single, perfect shot, only to sneak away unseen and leaving not a trace. Like the shadow of a ghost in the jungle. Sniper: Ghost Warrior is just about as far from this ideal as it is possible to come.\n\nAs a sniper, your primary tool lies simply in not being seen. This would typically entail you wanting to stay off roads, footpaths and other places where people usually travel. In S:GW, you can only dream of this. The area in which you can move is so narrow, you'd get claustrophobia if it weren't for the fact that it looks relatively pretty. The catch is, there are so many invisible walls, idiotically placed fences (which you cannot jump over, of course), stupid fishing nets across the creek (which you cannot cut, even though you're carrying a knife), columns that just happened to have fallen just so, etc. etc.\n\nThe whole game is pretty much based on railroading of the highest order: You have to go there, to that exact rock shelf, before the victim decides to stroll out of his cabin. At one point, you are actually told to place a claymore on the path "in case there's a chase". (Three guesses what happens just after you take the shot ...)\n\nSight adjustments though. At least they have that down, right? As if ... you're left relying on Kentucky Windage. Because the game is actually simulating wind. You even have a wind gauge that is visible in the scope, to help you place your shots properly. That would be handy, if it hadn't been for the fact that the wind is completely random. But they've solved that problem for you as well: You see, you have a tiny red circle travelling around the crosshairs, which tells you precisely where your bullet will hit. All so you don't have to worry about boring things like finding the range or elevation relative to your target. Because who would want that in a sniper game. Oh, and is that magic circle moving too fast for you? Don't worry, you can just press shift to go into bullet-time. /facepalm\n\nBut they do have bullet-drop, so they have at least modelled ballistics to some degree. Yay.\n\nSo, you know where you'll hit before you fire your shots. Or so you would think. Well, you'll just have to hope that the chain-link fence through which you're shooting, is of the type that bullet's can actually penetrate. Because not everything is as it seems in this game. You can shoot through (some) walls, but not through all chain-link fences. You can jump up on a ledge only to meet an invisible wall 10 cm further in, etc. etc.\n\nWith so many things about which to be annoyed, it seems almost banal to point out that the level design is hopelessly bad (e.g. the obvious railroading) and that the scenarios are completely unrealistic. For example: you're asked to sneak into the middle of a military installation carrying a weapon whose optimum range is >300m. Luckily, the AI is so moronic, it doesn't really matter: You can be lying on the other side of a river, taking out infantry in a village chock full of them, and they won't bat an eyelid when their friend mysteriously decides to start the siesta 8 hours prematurely. 2 meters away from them. The loud bang immediately following is obviously completely unrelated. But don't try to walk up-right behind an enemy instead of crouching like you've learned, because then they've suddenly got superman-hearing and flash-reflexes and you're dead before you even have time to jump.\n\nAt some point in time, I think the developers realized that they weren't really working on the worlds greatest sniper game, because in the middle of the game you suddenly change roles and run around like a regular infantryman with an M16 or similar rifle. And if the game is lousy as a sniper game, it really sucks as a standard "run & gun". Everything is still just as fricking scripted: The enemies come running only once you walk through the gate (which is of course your only choice of route) and your allies faithfully wait for you to be a pointman and advance the battle. Meanwhile, they're busy, locked in an eternal gunfight with the AI, none of whom seem to be able to hit the broad side of a barn. So it is in fact an illusion that you have helpers in the grunt scenarios. In reality, you're just as alone there as you are in the forest. The only difference is you're playing an abysmal infantry game instead of a boring sniper game.\n\nSmall blessings and everything, but I'm so glad I followed my gut feeling and didn't fork out for this game at full price, but waited for the infamous holiday sale. But even at todays low, low price, this game isn't worth it.","January 23, 2014","false","7.2"," 90 of 106 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","90","106","0","1"

Make no mistake: the game looks decent and there's a lot of emphasis on the sniping action which feels a lot of fun. The features section of the game's store page highlights the importance of weather, wind and how the bullet trajectory / drop can be affected by them. It's all good but just not enough to result in a good game.\n\nCampaign is short and extremely difficult. While sniping is fun you are told exactly where to go and what to do. It is so heavily scripted that under no circumstances do you feel you should try it again. From time to time you are in the shoes of a soldier only allowed to handle rifles or SMGs. Fighting with these is very difficult. It has nothing to do with how these weapons work: the enemy can just easily spot you and shoot you down. This switching back and forth from the easy sniping and the very hard gunning sequences just makes the game unplayable.\n\nIn addition to this, I was unable to find any games online. Not that after the horrible single player I wanted any. Sniper Ghost Warrior is an original game: its creators knew a lot of people liked sniping so they developed a game with that in mind. It was just not executed properly. If they had taken the time to refine the campaign and completely get rid of the non-sniper weapons this would have easily been on top of the list of my favourite games.","June 14, 2014","false","4.6"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","33","39","0","0"

It takes into account distance, bullet drop, momentum and wind which makes shooting a bit more engaging that just pointing the reticle at the enemy and firing. If all of this sound daunting to you, don't fret. The game does feature “aim assist” in the form of a dot that lets you know where to fire from.\nThe story is not THAT bad (its not good though)\nCons\n\nThe game is riddled with bugs and clipping issues\nThe game suffers from some hit detection issue. Sometimes shooting straight at a guy will not register and if an enemy is being any type for foliage he will not get hit at all.\nThe A.I is pretty stupid and seems to be activate when you look at them which is weird.\nThe sound design is just bad. The voice acting is not that great, the enemies have the exact same dialogue from the beginning of the game to the end and the sound effects are pretty poor.. At several point in the game I have heard Soldier A and Soldier B having a conversation where both were saying the exact same lines.\nThe game is very short. I finished the main campaign on Normal in three and half hour and the dlc campaign in about one hour. There is another challenge mode that I did not touch.\n\n\nLooking at the Pros and Cons it seems as though the game is not worth playing but I have found myself enjoying every moment of the game. It is campy, it is buggy and never rises above mediocre but it was just fun; Sneaking around sniping people, seeing your plan of attack succeed or even just hitting a guy while he is running were all very fulfilling. I recommend the game to people that can overlook some of its flaws and focus on the good that is in there (however little that is).","February 7, 2015","true","6.5"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","27","34","0","1"

A stealthy sniper game - like you would expect from the name? A common military FPS shooter? In the end, nothing of this feels right as it should.\n\nIn the stealth missions it's hard to stay undetected. Even if you really try - the so-called KI spots you 10km far away, they raise the alarm immediately and you don't have a chance to turn it off. You shoot with a silenced weapon? Everyone else in a distance about 20m seems to be aware of that shot.\n\nNevertheless, in the levels you play the opposite side you just try to go in like Rambo. The recoil of the assault rifle is rediculous. I couldn't get a clear shot with it and mostly died because my character seems to be the only target for the enemy while two of your KI-friends stands around and shoot everything that moves. That makes it nearly impossible to play it on hard (for the achievements).\nI don't mind neither the linearity of this game nor the invisible walls. But the controlls and the gameplay itselfs are so bad that I didn't mind to play forward anymore.\n\nYou can get it very cheap out of a bundle? Feel free to buy it, but don't pay the whole price for it.

The sniper sections are fine, if a little monotonous. But the parts of this game that make me slam my head on the desk and give it a negative review are the assault sections.\n\nIn these sections you are given an M4 rifle and tasked with killing a lot of enemies in close quarters. The recoil on the M4 is so high (way higher than a real 223 round would ever give), that it is basically trial and error killing the enemies, since the gun lacks a semi-automatic option. There are enough of these sections that, especially on the harder difficulties, completing the game can become something nightmarish requiring repeated attempts of the same gunfight.\n\nBut the game is mainly focussed around the sniping experience, so I wish those assault sections didn't even exist. The sequel is much better and is a game that I would actually recommend, thankfully void of any annoying parts like that.","October 24, 2014","false","12.8"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

But before that you're rushed through a training mission that emphasizes how important stealth is in the game, then it immediately forgets all pretenses of stealth as it confusedly tries to rush you through an action campaign, which it feels like there was a rift going on here. Half the studio probably wanted to make the next Call of Duty game, and then the other half wanted to make something more like the Sniper Elite series.\nSo you run through an earlier part of the mission with your buddy who has a weird callsign that you'll forget three seconds after hearing it, then you go through some combat and he gets taken back for his six o clock dental appointment on a boat, which you're glad he's gone because he's a terrible teammate anyways. Then you're supposed to escape using stealth, meanwhile you can't actually be stealthy. Like one area of the map where you're supposed to get from one end of the village to the other while being super sneaky, you climb through the tall grass, taking everything super slow, waiting for enemies to move, learning their pathing, generally being super good with your tactics. And then out of nowhere, ♥♥♥♥boy davey decides to shoot you with his gun because he somehow saw this elite trained sniper in his native environment... Yeah, GG on that one.\nBut then because the game gets bored, they quickly drop you on an oil rig where you're supposed to be doing some fast paced actiony shooty shooty sections, all the while I'm sitting here thinking "I bought Sniper game, but right now I'm not even carrying a sniper rifle at all!" That section ends and then you get back to the mainland, 'whew, time to do more sniping!' but nah, one member of your squad (oh yeah, you pick up a few guys at one point and then they go break on tea time, really I don't know where they went, I just looked up at one moment and they left me) gets hit by a sniper bullet, and then you have to go through this terribly designed village in order to uh..... do a thing I guess? I have no idea what the main goal for this game is yet, and I feel/hope I'm most of the way through the game (Honestly I was just playing and sorta raged at a certain section of the game, I'll get to that later) But this village has very few paths, actually really just one path, there were only maybe multiple paths because I found a way to get around some invisible walls. And by this point the AI have somehow downloaded an aimbot.exe because they're outsniping the trained sniper. Also this particular section was frustrating because the amount of cover was minimal, the enemies were spread out far, (meaning that if you move your character half an inch to the side, like five of them now have an angle to shoot you from) and even with the lack of cover, there's no good way to work around it. A decent peeking system would have made this part much smoother without providing an unfair advantage to players. Not to mention moving around the tight corridors in the building nearby is nearly impossible when your character feels like a piece of clay with two wheels and a gun attached to him. After you've finished that area you go and try and kill some more guys that you quickly realize are nearly indistinguishable from the vegetation nearby (though somehow they instantly see you when you're climbing around in the brush, actively TRYING to be sneaky) and then for no reason whatsoever, the game teleports you to a lighthouse for you to shoot people from. (I should mention that I wanted to test out how amazingly easy it was for the AI to spot me, so I went prone at the top of this tower, just observing them, and then boom... one guy popped out of a truck and shot me just about immediately after his boots touched the ground....) At this point I don't know whether I'm playing as five different characters or not. Like how the hell did I randomly get to a lighthouse? Did I spirit hop into one of the other guys in the squad, and he's decided to get onto a lighthouse? Can't be because my player has the same voice! So what happened then? Am I secretly a member of the X-men that just teleports wherever he wants? Oh well, at least in this particular spot I have a sniper rifle... for the second time in the game.","April 29","false","3.6"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","13","16","2","0"

The problem with focusing on one element of a game is that you need to do that element extremely well in order to be successful. While this game does do this well – the camera angles and feeling you get while sniping is very good.Sniper: Ghost Warrior puts you in the midst of a deadly conflict in South America. It’s your duty as an American soldier to assist the rebels in overthrowing the dictator of this fictional country. Combat locations are varied, from urban streets to the sweltering humid jungles. There’s no shortage of action, and like the locations, the gameplay is varied.There’s nothing terrible about this game, and there's also nothing terribly original either. There are some technical issues which keep it from ever being considered a classic. Some of the glitches you'll encounter include clipping graphics and control command errors. In some instances you can see through walls and other structures. Unfortunately it also appears the A.I. has this ability as they can pinpoint your location with uncanny accuracy once you’ve fired off a shot.A sniper’s life isn’t all sunshine and lollipops, so expect the unexpected, along with some frustrating elements you will have little control over.Despite the clipping, the graphics are well done, creating spacious environments such as the villages and jungle areas. There isn’t much story to concern you, just follow orders and keep yourself alive.Like Splinter Cell, there is a meter to determine your level of stealth in relation to the enemy's perception. It will indicate the degree the enemy is aware of your presence, so you’ll always have instant feedback on your progress making the stealth segments more exciting. Ghost Warrior is a bit like a basically excellent rough diamond, that no one wanted to polish any further. It's got good ideas and good visuals, but nowadays, that alone just isn't enough to be able to keep up with the competition.Overall 6/10.","September 27, 2014","true","155.9"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","23","35","0","0"

Then came the run and gun oil rig and breaking through some areas with a weapon that is useless.  For some unknown reason you are not allowed to have your sniper rifle in these areas.  As others have pointed out there are arbitrary walls and a narrow area to work in.  You can not go under some of the nets or over some fences for some silly reason.  In the beginning of the Alliance to save Rod my two comrades stuck in place standing in the first courtyard in front of the first building.  I never did find the Dag sniper rifle anywhere.\n\nEven with the small area to work in being a sniper is fun but the run and gun stuff should have been left our or let us have a decent rifle and the option to use our sniper rifle.\n\nAs others have pointed out the KI is ridiculous.  They can spot and shot you from miles away with one shot  but you can empty a clip into one and he still fires at you.  They must have superaccurate automatic weapons unlike the piece of junk you have to run and gun with.\n\nAt least is allows you to save instead of having a brain dead checkpoint system so you don't loose a lot of time if you  have to reload - unlike Ghost Warrior 2.\n\nI'm on the fence.

Those expectations were shot down, butchered, and had gasoline poured on them to make a lovely bonfire just to make sure nothing could be salvaged.\n\nThe game was quite enjoyable up until the oil rig, where you take over one of the members of the commando team in the first assault mission. The sniping mechanics might be good, but the assault rifle has so much kick you couldn't hit the broad side of a mountain half the time, much less a moving target shooting at you. I spent over an hour on the second assault mission just trying to clear the first part, pretty much having to save after every kill.\nOn the subject of accuracy, the enemy AIs have too much. you're sniping them from halfway across the map, and not only do they see you, they manage to accurately hit you half the time. With assault rifles and pistols. I know the game is supposed to have 'accurate ballistics', but I kind of expected it to be for BOTH SIDES, not just the player. To make matters worse, when you do have team mates, they tend to be very useless, when they actually move and not just stand around like statues. I was playing on meduim, and it felt more like extreme difficulty from other games.\n\nSufficed to say, this was a very badly done game. With the exception of the sniper rifle, pretty much every gun in the game sucks, and unless you play it on easy, expect some frustration. Even on easy, expect some frustration. Sufficed to say, I didn't get very far into the game, and I probably won't get much farther. This one quickly turned into a chore rather then a pleasure. If you feel the need to try Sniper: Ghost Warrior, get it when its on sale, cause it is not worth the full price.","September 25, 2015","false","2.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I liked the silent throwing knife stuff and bullet-time headshots were very good. Also the way the bullet drops is realistic and how you have to predict where the enemy will be too. It is also affected by your heartbeat, which is really cool. There is a red-dot to show you where the bullet will hit. If they made a follow-up to this game it could be superb, just to focus more on sniping! The story was good, not great, not too predictable though. I also think the scenery and backgrounds do well to make you think, "is that a soldier there?", and this works well, keeping you on your toes and using your sniper well as a binocular. The action areas of this game are a bit tricky as some enemies are hard to spot but if you use the damage direction help then you'll be ok.\n\nBut it's not bad, yes flawed, but for a first attempt it's very good going! It plays well, a little (and a lot) frustrating in parts, but something about it made me want to play more. Slow-motion headshots are very satisfying! Also the visibility to the enemy bar was helpful and a welcome addition.

The game's AI is also utter ♥♥♥♥ and is broken as hell. They will find you and they certainly WILL kill you. No matter how camouflaged you are hiding in a thick bush or behind a tree they will know your exact position. They will hit you and barely miss any shots at all.\n\nThere is several sections in the game where you go all rambo in close quarters with assault rifles, shotguns, you name it. This game is definitely not a true sniper experience which it seemingly appears to be. It is in fact some kind of modern FPS action game in the disguise of something that could have been a great game.\n\nThat was the singleplayer part, I have yet to try the multiplayer out but from what I know the levels are far more open-ended in MP and there's no AI, just normal players like yourself which sounds surprisingly pleasant. The multiplayer might be worth it but the singleplayer sure isn't.\n\nJudging by my experience of this game I would definitely not recommend this game to anyone looking for an actual sniper game.","January 31, 2014","false","2.6"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","18","30","0","0"

Many flaws, but mostly enjoyable. That's the TL;DR of all my thoughts on the game.\n\nI came into this expecting blandness, but I must say, the parts where you're sniping are VERY enjoyable. It feels very nice to control, and after getting a hang of it, it's really easy to headshot people. When it goes into the bullet cam, that feels great. If this game was entirely sniping, I'd give it a much higher rating.\n\nThe problem is, you're not always sniping. There's parts where you must use an assault rifle, and it feels AWFUL. Horrible hit detection and hardly any damage, and the enemies basically have aimbots, while you can't even see them. It feels very tacked on, and the game suffers for it.\n\nThere are quite a few glitches, from clipping issues, to my teammates falling off of a boat, to this random invincible aimbot guy that could kill me in less than a second from half a mile away. Most of these were quite hilarious, except for that aimbot guy.\n\nThe story's not original in any sense, but I didn't expect much. It's a bit better than most of these macho military man game stories, though.\n\nBut honestly, even with the glitches and the assault rifle parts, on the whole this is a quite enjoyable game. My playtime is how long it took me to beat single player on normal. I didn't bother trying multiplayer because I assume's that's dead.\n\nI will indeed recommend it. Play it if you want to have an enjoyable sniping experience, and are willing to overlook some flaws.\n\nTip: If you manually save, it's like a savestate wherever you put it, and deaths will return you to it. So, you could savescum through the assault rifle parts, for instance.","December 13, 2014","true","5.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I just couldn't.\n\nThe game is a ton of fun and has variety to spice things up. Through most of the campaign you play as "Tyler" The sniper. You stealth through villages, slaughter hundreds of people via pistol or sniper rifle, and just be a general badass. However what I didn't see coming was that there are also several segments of the game where it turns into Call of Duty and you're taking oil rigs with an assault rifle as "Conway" a member of "Delta". It was an..interesting surprise but the mechanics in the game REALLY don't suit assault rifle gameplay.\n\nIt runs decently on modern systems. Some graphical glitches unfortunately, ESPECIALLY if you're running multi-gpu. NOTE: Do not run this game with multi-GPU.\n\nThe stealth system is basic. The graphics are...decent. Textures are horrible but character models and object models have their high-points. The sniping "circle" that indicates where your shot will land breaks occasionally, ESPECIALLY when you zoom further in with your scope. The main campaign is very short, about 5 hours. The DLC Campaign "Unfinished Business" will add about 3 hours to the game give or take (But is immensely frustruating due to an extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ checkpoint system).\n\nThe story is very uninteresting. I've finished both campaigns and I just remember bits and pieces of everything. I couldn't tell you who Tyler was employed with, why we were fighting who we were fighting or anything. I LOVE stories too, I buy games mostly for the stories! But this one is just pathetic.\n\nThe characters are meh as well. Tyler is a regular individual, Conway is....a guy with a name...and O'Neil just has a voice actor that makes me want to remember him, but he was so underdeveloped I'll forget him in two days tops.\n\nThe multiplayer is horrendous. Extreme server latency issues. Consistent fluctuating ping regardless of your internet connection. And all for what? A Call of Duty with nothing but snipers and silenced pistols? No thank you. (As well as broken server finding that stops you from hosting any server using any DLC weapons/maps due to the developer forgetting to include that information in the server list)\n\nAll in all this game is not worth your time. There are MUCH better games out there, but if you have this one, no harm in giving it a try. It is drudgerous however, and your effort never pays off as the ending is likely the WORST part of this game. All 3 of them. (Yes, there are 3. The main campaign ending, the DLC ending, and then finding out you're not done and there's a "Challenge" mode that's 1 mission to end the entire game- which I never played because after 8 hours I grew SO sick of the game.)\n\nFInal Verdict is a 4/10.

Only a couple of run and gun chapters, that are actually making you relax and break lose, shooting everything that comes at you.\nYes, there are some bugs but they don't impact the game-play to my opinion.

I saw that it were on sale so i bought it to play it once more. Things have changed.\n\nThe game feels bad, just bad. The AI works in some wierd ways (Can't see you when you are 2 meters infront of them but will eagle eye you cross map). The movement is also really awkward, it feels like you are Jimmy from South park, you can't even walk up stairs without needing to jump. The sniping however is good, hiding in the bushes and picking off targets feels nice and rewarding. I would recommend this game if it weren't for one thing. Soldier play. Somehow the guys that made this thought it was a good idea to have levels where you play as a soldier with an assault rifle, it plays like ♥♥♥♥. You know those days in middleschool when your best friend was sick? The day wasn't hard or painfull, but just really really boring, right? It's like that, you just want it over.\n\nThe only reason i can recommend it is if you really want to play some sniper games, but if you are looking for entertainment you have come to the wrong place. Plus the game only last 4 (painfully long) hours.\n\nI rate this 5 bacon strips out of 10\n\nNOTE: The Second strike DLC is actually kind of good.","May 22","false","6.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When you start playing, you play as a marksman who has to stealthily kill enemies to get to where you need to go, that part of the gameplay is pretty well made. But, I am currently playing on a mission where stealth and "sniping" are nonexistant. The game has totally thrown those two core elements out of the window and replaced them will assault rifles that have rediculous recoil that is not appropriate (take this from someone who has shot the exact gun they are using in real life) and and have no selector switches to swap the firing modes which only compounds the other issue. There are also numerous bugs that are very obvious and it puzzles me how they made it to release.\n\nI got this game in a bundle for like $4 so I'm not all that mad, just very  very disappointed.

This results in absurd situations. For example, in stealth levels, enemies will raise the alarm the moment they see you, but won't as long as they don't - EVEN IF you just shot the guy standing right next to them. For another example, the in-game radar doesn't show enemies until you look at them - a great logical idea. However, enemies show on your radar if you cross sufficiently close to them, even if you never directly looked at them. At other times, the radar won't register a enemy if you are looking at him through your scope - extremely weird for a game titled Sniper.\nThere are 3 stances - standing, crouching and crawling. Ideally, you should be forced to choose between running from cover to cover or slowly crawling in the hopes of being undetected. In the game though, you just have to crawl always.\n\nWorst of all  are the controls. Totally unresponsive and the mouse sensitivity is way too high.\nAnd I would expect a stealth game to have a separate key for lying prone. Nope - you have to long-press the crouch key.\nEven CoD has separate keys for these stances.","February 26, 2015","false","1.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","2"

The Regular infantry fighting sucks due to the accuracy of the enemies being aimbot on medium difficulty and a kid with downs on easy. The Marksman Fighting isn't much better. You are dropped into a scenerio with little to no backstory of why you are there or why your even trying to ambushing this whole convoy of anywhere from 50-100 soldiers by yourself.(i never lived to find out how many exactly due to the aimbot qualities of medium difficulty) The Sniping on the whole is fun however with the design of the sniper rifle scope showing exactly where the round with hit, making it fun and easy. This however doesn't matter when the enemy can shoot you from the hip at the same distance. the only thing good is the sneaking to where you need to go missions. however this is also pointless due to your final "kill shot" ,no matter where placed on the target, will not kill them. which is lovingly announced by yourself saying "the shot was not effective" and then you are forced to watch the target you spend the last half hour stalking drive away.

So my thought..Game was impressive, now it's all went down a sinkhole. Mission is impossible and i think the main reason the word "Simple" is in the missions name is because it's just trying to ♥♥♥♥ you off because of the fact it's supposedly simple but it's not..so i'm done and quite frankly it's a shame but i won't probably play this game anymore..Did i mention that when you die from these annoying Enemy's you spawn right beside them..like straight in the middle of the fire-zone...Sniper v. 20 Enemy's armed with Assault Rifle's and unlimited Frags...uhm no thanks..","February 14, 2014","false","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Regular infantry fighting sucks due to the accuracy of the enemies being aimbot on medium difficulty and a kid with downs on easy. The Marksman Fighting isn't much better. You are dropped into a scenerio with little to no backstory of why you are there or why your even trying to ambushing this whole convoy of anywhere from 50-100 soldiers by yourself.(i never lived to find out how many exactly due to the aimbot qualities of medium difficulty) The Sniping on the whole is fun however with the design of the sniper rifle scope showing exactly where the round with hit, making it fun and easy. This however doesn't matter when the enemy can shoot you from the hip at the same distance. the only thing good is the sneaking to where you need to go missions. however this is also pointless due to your final "kill shot" ,no matter where placed on the target, will not kill them. which is lovingly announced by yourself saying "the shot was not effective" and then you are forced to watch the target you spend the last half hour stalking drive away. SOUNDS FUN RIGHT??? then this is the game for you, no me.... Love from Russia","May 24, 2014","false","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am not too sure as I did reload a part where there was an error.\nSo it's around 8-10 hours.\n\nI had the difficulty to the hardest possible.\nI didn't like the feel of it, although, I beat it with ease.\nThe enemy sees you and you're automatically hit. It's not that they see you, it's more that, it's programmed to see you. You have a few other team mates around and they can stand there and not get hit at all.\nSo you're constantly behind cover and pop out and go back and forth waiting to recharge to 30 health each time. There's really no point in the health pack, it's like 100% health and 30% is nearly alike.\n\nOne of the missions where you had to kill one of the person doesn't work. Even if you kill him, he's still free. (it's not supposed to allow you to kill him, yet, you can)\n\nThe sound is... okay I suppose. Directional sound you can hear.\nI did have issues with text, intro and the ending being upside down. It didn't, however, detract from the game as it played out normally.\n\nThe multiplayer is extremely few. If you want to play this game for that reason, there's just no point.\nYou'll also get many 4v2 and no one switching over to make it even. This happens way too many times, like 8 times nearly in a row a couple of days ago. As if, why wouldn't they make the game even? They are winning so why?\nSo the community is not good.. Not good at all. They just do not care at all about it and want the game to die even more when it comes to multiplayer. So I guess, let it die. (Also, me being a new player to this, every one of the people are easy to kill, but when it is 4v2, it's not much you can really do)\n\nThe ending was.... lackluster. It wasn't special, it didn't do anything. It just... ended.\nI didn't play any of the DLCs, I didn't feel as though they were worth getting.\nI would recommend at least playing it if you get it in a bundle. The price, well, I suppose it is okay.\nThere is some enjoyments you can get out of this game. To be honest, I was hoping the game ended sooner for me.\n\nThe AI is horrible. You can kill people right near em and they will not notice. Like, blood will splatter all over them(not really, since the blood doesn't stick on em) and they will just do nothing.\n\nSo I guess, just play it if you have it or it is extremely cheap. Though, I wouldn't get it just to pick this game from a bundle.\nSo, in essence, do I really recommend it?\n\n","June 6, 2014","true","51.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Why? Because it's directly centered around the tactics and style protrayed by modern military sniper. This game displays a set of youth ranged ballistics and areodynamics, which does occasionally draw away from a true expierience. While it may feature bullet drop to some degree, that is the only true force that with be acting aginst where you hit your target. It fetures no windage, elevation change or temperature, etc. However, for the average person interested in this theme of military force, the game offers a great time. Still looking for a true sniper game though, but it's worth the buy if you are new to things like this. I highly recomend setting this on the "Hard" setting, as it gets rid of the red dot which allows for a much better expierience as a sniper.","July 1, 2014","true","10.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In most levels the enemies seem to have ESP on where you are and how you are traveling, in other levels you can almost walk right in front of them and they don't seem to notice.  When they do notice you they are scary deadly with their aim.  I played all the single player content plus the DLC, and yes, the hours I put into this game are correct.  The sniping can really be satisfying on many levels and I found myself playing levels over and over because it had really good sniping.

(Again, linear gameplay)\n\n- The automatic rifles are just ridicilous. I have never seen worst. (You'll see what I mean if you play the game)\n\n- In hard difficulty, it feels like all your enemies are veteran snipers who were born with the ability of sniping. They have no problem shooting you with a pistol from 200m. I mean sure, the game should be hard but not unrealistically hard. You can make the AI smarter or increase Damage taken or increase wind speed and change environmental factors, but if you are being hit by a pistol bullet from 200m away and almost dying from that shot, then that just makes the game stupid and annoying... Not "difficult".\n\nIn short, Sniper: Ghost Warrior is an extremely average game. There is nothing special about it that makes it stand out. If you like sniper games in general and if stupid bugs, glitches and unnecessary things don't bother you, then you can try this game.\n\nI'd give it a 6/10.","March 2","false","20.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

It looks pretty good, but the monotonous voice acting of the sniper is annoying. Is he not the same guy that voiced the boring lead in Alpha Protocol? And as for the enemy AI, don't get me started! I have a sniper rifle, they have standard issue assault rifles, yet if I twitch they can spot and shoot me with unerring accuracy from 500 metres away. Not to mention the fact that they appear out of nowhere, without warning in a spot that was empty only a second previously!\nThat said, I have just finished my third playthrough and, despite the games many flaws,(including my reward for completing it all being just ;THE END') there is still a great deal of satisfaction to be gained from whacking the bad guys from far away and following your bullet to target in slow motion.\nWould I recommend it?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theycallmetimothy/recommended/34830/","theycallmetimothy","Thomas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theycallmetimothy/","99 products in account","Who doesn't like snipers? Well, maybe the poor guys that have to patrol those deserted open streets and jungles. Ever since I played the "All Ghillied Up" and "One Shot One Kill" mission in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, snipers have always kept a special place in my heart. They are portrayed as coldblooded, skilled experts, trained to kill with precision. And while the sniper has sadly lost some of his respect, especially in video games (thanks for that one, codkiddies, hope the noscopes were worth it) they  are still treated with a lot of respect in most media (give the movie "Shooter" and the Sniper series a try if you're interested in more one shot one kill gunporn). So back when I found out about this game, I was kind of interested in it. But just like Metro 2033, it's not until quite some years after releasedate in 2010 that I finally bought a copy for just one key and tried it out. And boy, does this review hurt to write. Because not only did I want the game to be good, I even enjoyed it sometimes. Yes, you read that one correctly. Quite a few aspects in Sniper: Ghost Warrior are a lot of fun. The sniping mechanics are pretty sweet and so is the bullet cam (arguments about whether or not a gory cam like Sniper Elite's is better belong in the comments). The graphics are fairly pretty and the tropical island setting seems to be a nice homage to the previously mentioned Sniper series (first one is set in South-America). The story, while nothing spectacular, does the job: dictatorship overthrew the democratic government and we can't go in all guns blazing, so you go and snipe things out for us (kind of like in that movie again..). And hey, there are some jokes, there's some cool stuff, all that. Voice-acting is solid, but I'd appreciate it if the enemy soldiers would stop talking about each others' sisters so much, or what brand of tobacco they prefer. But there are some big problems with the game, too. Firstly, the AI is just strange, as in the bad kind of strange: sometimes they're nothing but brainless tangos with legs, just waiting for a bullet through the brain, sometimes they seem to have binoculars for eyes and can spot you when you can't even see them. The AI is very accurate with their weapons, which is not that much of a bad thing in a stealth game (you shouldn't remain alive long if you'd happen to be spotted), if it weren't for the fact that you sometimes have to go "all guns blazing".\nThat's right! Forget your stealthy ghilliesuits, scope breathing and breath holding fetish, we've got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and forced assault rifle segments to play! Although I must admit some of these missions aren't so bad if you're still allowed to keep your distance and can pick them off before they even notice you. Sadly, the game felt like targetting the CoD audience and thus you sometimes play as Ranger McAssaultrifle to use your M4 that seems to have more recoil than any other fire arm in the game, even sniper rifles.\nThere are so many weird and downright awful things about this game but I won't waste too much of your time anymore. I cannot recommend the game, I'm sorry, except if you really want to play a sniper focused game that is played in first person and you can get this game for cheap (one key is a reasonable price, two is the maximum amount I'd pay). Despite all the previous stuff I mentioned, I enjoyed Ghost Warrior a lot sometimes. The fairly open levels work wonderful in a jungle or island setting and you sometimes feel like a real ghost warrior in some of the better stealth missions. But the lazyl AI programming, bad decisions in game design (giving an USAS shotgun more range and less recoil than an assault rifle? Really?) and bugs or glitches you'll encounter sometimes keep me from recommending me this one to a lot of people. If you want to give it a try, feel free to do so, but be warned: there's a lot of ugy besides the wonderful sniping mechanics. That said, I am looking forward to giving the sequel a try, although that one seems to have received mixed ratings as well.","June 25, 2014","false","9.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

It forces you to change roles between a sniper and a random soldier with a loud machine gun. This game tries to promote a stealthy approach but contradicts itself when in the first mission your spotter pulls out a machine gun and begins to fire, giving away your position. Overall, the game gives off the feel of a cheap, quickly made fps with no skill involved in it.","August 6, 2014","false","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

It looks pretty good, but the monotonous voice acting of the sniper is annoying. Is he not the same guy that voiced the boring lead in Alpha Protocol? And as for the enemy AI, don't get me started! I have a sniper rifle, they have standard issue assault rifles, yet if I twitch they can spot and shoot me with unerring accuracy from 500 metres away. Not to mention the fact that they appear out of nowhere, without warning in a spot that was empty only a second previously!\nThat said, I have just finished my third playthrough and, despite the games many flaws,(including my reward for completing it all being just ;THE END') there is still a great deal of satisfaction to be gained from whacking the bad guys from far away and following your bullet to target in slow motion.\nWould I recommend it?

It hasn't aged well, and the things that were annoying about it 6 years ago are only magnified in this age.\n\nWhile a million miles better than CI Games previous effort at the genre - the woeful Sniper Art of Victory - it still falls short of a pleasant FPS experience.  The somewhat satisfying sniping elements are held back by an AI that doesn't know if it's on God mode or stormtrooper mode, while the infantry parts of the game are held back by the fundamentally broken assault rifles that the game gives those characters.\n\nAI can detect you seemingly for no reason as you are in cover, they can sometimes care if you kill their buddies 5 feet away and otherwise not.  At one point I took a break from a mission to shoot birds with an unsilanced rifle, then when I carried on realised there had been a 3 man patrol not 30 feet away that was still in "oblivious" mode.\n\nThe feeling of achievement of pulling off a hit with your rifle, taking into account bullet drop due to gravity and wind direction is cheapend somewhat when your enemies can hit you with pinpoint precision using their assault rifles at the same distance.  These are the same assault rifles you will struggle to use, as the kick and spread is extreme to the point of uselessness.\n\nManual saving is encouraged with this game, the chekpoints aren't always in places you would expect and can indeed just put you into a loop of spawn-die-spawn-die.\n\nAt least CI Games paid for some proper voice talent this time round - but the story they are telling is very cliche.\n\nYou'll have more fun with Sniper Elite 2 if you want to play a sniper game- I promise you.","March 20","false","7.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics and bugs are pretty bad. More than half of the enemies start running against a wall half the time and won't stop unless you shoot them. Also, you can put your gun and arm through almost anything, including trees and buildings. But, the gameplay is really good. The game is a lot like Sniper Elite, including that you can slow everything down to control your breathing, and there's a red dot below the crosshair you have to aim for, and that it zooms in on a lot of kills. It's also not all sniping. There is a lot of missions where you'll have assault rifles and no snipers. But the point of the game is all about just killing enemies, it's about being stealth and then taking perfect shots while hidden. There's also a lot of cutscenes and story. It's not the best game ever, especially because of the bugs, but for 8 dollars, it's worth it.","December 1, 2014","true","10.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I thought the graphics were great for a slightly older game, it ran very smoothly and I also liked the audio that gave a constant feeling of tension (though it did get a bit repetitive).\n\nThe sniping action was extremely satisfying - getting a headshot from 150m away and seeing the slowmo kill cam was truly gratifying and made me want to yell out "HEADSHOT" ala Unreal Tournament lol! I think I may have done that a few times :p\n\nOne aspect that i didn't like though was that you did not always play a sniper. Most of the time you were Razor 6-4, the sniper and that was great but sometimes you'd switch to playing the ground team Delta-3 who are using close quarters assault rifles and this is a very different style of gameplay which can be quite annoying. There were only 2 of these that I remember though and the rest of the game makes up for it.\n\nI bought this game in a bundle for around $1 but it is definitely worth more. Loved it.

I played the actual game for ~5 minutes, once I found a way to get it to lauch properly.\n\nLet me regail you all with a story.\n\nOnce upon a time there was a man who had seen a game that looked good and was on sale. The man goes out and buys a Steam card to purchase said game, he even went and picked up a slightly better graphics card. He comes home to his wife and children, they are awaiting his return eagerly. He picks up his daughter and messes up his sons hair, then he kisses his wife. He was so excited to finally get a new game to play in his free time.\nHe goes onto the Steam store, and there he sees it. Sniper: Ghost Warrior. He adds it to his cart and checks out. He was amazed at the download speed, for surely a good FPS would not be such a blazing download.\nThis was the first flag.\nThe man, with hope still flowing out of his heart like the river Isen into Isengard, presses the "Play" button and waits.\n1 minute and the game had not loaded. He thought that it was just the game having that 1st boot-up speed.\nHe was wrong.\n5 minutes in and the game still had not loaded. He began to wonder if the game was going to load at all.\n7 minutes in and the game had crashed. At this point the man was becoming upset, so he went to bed and left the game to be dealt with another day.\nWeeks and months pass without a second of the mans play time spent on this game, the game had become a shelf-sitter. One day, the man decided to try to play the game again. He pressed "Play" and the game actually booted! The man was ecstatic! The game for which he had been hyped for so long ago was finally working!!\nThats when it happened. The game introduced the man into a well sculpted world, with enemies speaking in foreign tongues and sniper rifles with scrim all around them. It was, for a short time, beautiful.\nThe man eagerly got into a firefight, and then the worst thing happened. The mechanics were broken; hit detection, scoped accuracy, sound suppression, stealth mechanics and everything about the game. As he was sniping the skrubs like a boss, the man was shot; much like what would happen if one man was trying to take on 100+ enemies.\nThe game crashed.\nThe man was furious that after so long, and so much hype, the game still would not function.\nThe man later became very depressed; took up drinking and smoking.\nHis wife later divorced him and took the children into her custody.\nThe man lost his house and his job.\n\nAll of this simply because this game is so broken.\n\nMade a man get divorced, lose his children, his house, and his dog.\n\n10/10 Manic Depression Simulator 2010.","December 27, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","1","3","2","2"

You really can't get enough of those headshot bullet cams, hahaha. Also, the bullet drop and wind add to the realistic part of the game, and the guns are good.  As well as the bad guys.... DO NOT BREAK YOUR COVER. OR YOU DIE. Or just have a crapload of ammo to expend haha!\nMake sure u get 1 shot kills, and ya sneak around A LOT. Also, use throwing knives when you need to.\nHmmm... the multiplayer is kinda fun but a real challenge. I got the DLC and the misiions are pretty fun so far, haven't played a lot of multiplayer even in the normal game, which I think is just ok.\nOverall a good game if you love to snipe.","November 25, 2011","true","17.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

To enjoy this game you need patients and use the quck save button often.  You throw an alarm you are f**ked nuff said even on easy. Take your time and you will enjoy this game. I got it from a bundle so no money wasted it was worth every penny. I recommend this game if you like playing stealth games and sniping games that take patients. It's not really a fast paced shooter. Don't bother if you are afraid to fail on first 2nd or maybe even 3rd attempt at a situation. If you give up easily on games or have a short fuse, this is not for you. meta 55? No I'd give a meta 70 atleast.\nEdit I came accross this later on  here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper:_Ghost_Warrior I qoute it: "gamers with extreme patience and a passion for sniper rifles might enjoy themselves." So it pretty much backs my previous statment on patients is needed. I thought some parrts waa to easy but I'm a very very patient person thats willing to wait for a perfect shot. I actually wanted to enroll into military in my teen year to become a sniper but unfortunetly even I knew my eye sight would have probably never landed me as such so i never pursued it.

However(!), it's hard to ignore all the bugs in the game such as you can't go up small stairs unless you run for it, weirdly placed invisible walls, enemies that ignore dead mates, but as soon as they see you, they can see and hit you 500m away even though you're hiding or moving away. I've also had a few enemies either spawn or teleport right infront of me. And sometimes when you clearly can hit someone you'll just hit some invisible stuff (this is mainly an issue when you're the gunner), but they can still hit you. That, and the 5 hours and 45 min it took me to complete the game on hard while doing the other single player achievements, shows why this game has a Metascore of only 55/100.","May 26, 2011","true","20.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

While the game does have servicable graphics, the campaign missions are short, terribly linear and scripted and feature some of the worst enemy AI I have ever encountered in the genre.  You can literally shoot one of two adjacent enemies, and the other will act as if nothing has happened.  The enemies in the vicinity show up on the mini map in red, making taking most of them out a trivial matter.  The stealth is also poorly implemented, with foliage being opaque to the player, meaning a single blade of grass can completely obscure your view.  Add to that audio that seems to pan all around you giving no indication of enemy whereabouts and you are left with a disaster of a game.

Also, this is the first time I've attempted to make a professional/serious review.\n\nThe engine, CryEngine, in this version, does seem to be working well. I haven't found any random patches of un-detailed garbage like I see with most games. Even some AAA games I've played have this issue, and I was very surprised that this engine had overcome that problem. Physics are great (I can shoot off peoples hats for ♥♥♥♥s sake, it doesn't get better then that!). The only thing I don't like about the engine is the godly AI. If you hide in a bush or something, the enemy can still see you through all the leaves. If it weren't for that, I'd give a 10/10, but unfortunately, I have to take 0.5 off.\n\nThe game itself is very different. Story mode can be completed in under 6 hours or so, and I don't believe the story was even finished! It just sort of, ends. Nothing to keep me hanging, nothing to look forward to in the sequel, nothing. Mother 2 (which is the callout for HQ in this game) didn't even get to finish her line at the end of the game! After you kill whoever the bad guy was, the game immediately ends. And then there's challenge mode, which is difficult as ♥♥♥♥ to complete, thanks to the godly AI I was talking about earlier. In challenge mode, you play the game normally but without a rader and you can't know how much ammo or know how much health you have. This could be wrong, but I think challenge mode is forced/locked on hard difficulty too. While playing normal story mode, at medium difficulty, I found a glitch where the enemy didn't spawn in one of the missions. This caused the game to get confused, and end the mission after about two minutes of listening to "Razor 6-4, cover us!" repeatedly. Speaking of dialog, there are a lot of repeated lines. One of the most painful to listen to though was with the enemies. Even though they were speaking a different language, you could tell they were saying the same stuff they were talking about a just a few missions ago. This pained me because the developer truly thought he/she could get away with that, just because it was a different language. The plot in this game is about the only thing I can find good about the game. It's unique, the enemy isn't a terrorist like they are in most games. There's a drug lord, freeing another soldier and freeing civilian slaves. I haven't seen a plot like that in any other game that involved guns. One more thing, this game WILL NOT baby feed you with details.\n\nThe title of this game is really bad. Sniper: Ghost Warrior? Sure, you're a pretty legendary sniper, but there's nothing about being a ghost in this game besides the fact that there is stealth involved. And the word "warrior" is overused in game titles. No, I don't know what name I would have picked if I made this game, but it would have definitely been a little more creative then Sniper: Ghost Warrior.\n\nElement  Score  Engine  9.5  Graphics  10/10  Plot  9/10  Dialog  2/10  Title  2/10\nAverage/Overall: 6.5/10","April 4","false","8.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kohi_noir/recommended/34830/","kohi_noir","Kohi_Noir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kohi_noir/","193 products in account","Invisible walls: the game\n\nThere's some fun to be had here, especially in multiplayer, but I can only recommend this one for a bargain price. The graphics are rather pretty and the game runs well on older PCs too but the actual game contained in the engine isn't that interesting. Level design is incredibly linear and punishes every urge to explore with plenty of invisible walls and telescope-vision enemies, that often spot you from a huge distance if you stray from the tiny path offered by the developers. The sniping itself is a lot of fun at times and adjustable to your comfort level, despite the AI but regular gunplay which unfortunately occurs too is a drag and discourages further playing.\nThe story is of little help to keep you invested - even by the low standards of military shooters it's unengaging and keeps jumping back and forth between "characters" which I set in quotation marks because we never learn anything about the characters we are playing. I don't think I can even recall the name of the main character. Your main incentive as mr. soldier man is the voice in your head telling you to pop heads of south american baddies and after a while you kind of feel sympathy for the guys, since you, as the good guy, just show up with no authority, wreck their stuff and kill all their friends. It's somewhat feasible they might be the bad guys and it doesn't reach as far into the uncomfortable territory of the hyper-jingoistic splinter cell games but the story only has some shred of redeeming value if at the end it turns out you were part of a psychological experiment to determine how far you'd go if an authority figure tells you to.\n\nIn conclusion, Sniper: Ghost Warrior isn't deep enough as a stealth game and not fluid enough as an fps, marred by restrictive level design and a tedious single player campaign, however the multiplayer can be incredibly fun if you're not confronted by expert players. There aren't that many maps and modes but I enjoyed it more than any other generic fps in recent memory. There's a lot of room for improvement and the game is not a trainwreck by any means, but still I can't recommend it, unless you love multiplayer and you can get it really cheap.","November 27, 2014","false","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After playing this for a while I must say that besides the first map in single player campaign the game is rubbish and feels like it's in early alpha stage. The problem is that there are few levels after another that you do not even get to use sniper in sniper game, you are forced to use USAS or AK47 and they do not do any damage not even if you manage to get a perfect headshot. I recommend using the pistol instead because it is one hit one kill weapon. There are lots of bugs and enemies tend to shoot at you behind walls even if there is no way they should see you but if you crouch in bushes they can just walk over you and not notice you at all. The mechanics behind this game are broken. This title should have been cancelled or given even some polishing because single player is partly unplayable.

All you people out there who look at a game expecting perfection are never going to find it because every game has flaws. This one had a rather bold one, but not a terrible one. It looks nice, plays well, and falls under the category of "slightly broken but still enjoyable." Hell, look at it this way, Skyrim is more broken in places than a crate that met Gordon Freeman, but Skyrim is still pretty much the ideal video game.

It is a sniper's paradise with a campaign finely crafted for epic long shots. You may not find yourself too deeply embroiled in the rather bland story or the so-so voice acting and writing but you will ache for the next moment that you get the chance to line up a bad guy in your scope. This effect is intensified by the harder levels of difficulty that add in things like windage and elevation and lack a helper diamond that lets you know where to aim. It goes from being a game to an art form and a true sniper will feel right at home. If you are not a born sniper then this game is a solid "meh" you will have fun but not as much. The multiplayer is more of an afterthought and as aforementioned the campaign is really just a sniper sandbox with some story thrown in.

There are loads of bugs (mostly cosmetic, like when you die you just get this weird hall-of-mirrors effect), broken mission triggers, untextured regions of the map, parts where you die without explanation, stuff like that. Most of the maps are uninspired, with the same copy-pasted huts (themselves just empty, unlit, axis-aligned rectangles) over and over. The basic activity of the game is to snipe guys in the head using your focus skill, which is easy (even a body shot kills in one hit) and reasonably fun, though also very repetitive. I had a good time doing the "stealth" missions (they consist entirely of waiting for guards to turn around) by just killing everyone, though on some missions it'll just abort if you try this (even though it's easy to take on a whole camp yourself). I will say, it is quite lengthy (even with some bonus mission that might have been bundled DLC, I don't remember), so if you find yourself liking it, there's lots to play. I thought it was pretty tedious after a few missions, even to try to play the wrong way, and just wanted to get through it to move onto the next game.","August 2, 2014","false","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are loads of bugs (mostly cosmetic, like when you die you just get this weird hall-of-mirrors effect), broken mission triggers, untextured regions of the map, parts where you die without explanation, stuff like that. Most of the maps are uninspired, with the same copy-pasted huts (themselves just empty, unlit, axis-aligned rectangles) over and over. The basic activity of the game is to snipe guys in the head using your focus skill, which is easy (even a body shot kills in one hit) and reasonably fun, though also very repetitive. I had a good time doing the "stealth" missions (they consist entirely of waiting for guards to turn around) by just killing everyone, though on some missions it'll just abort if you try this (even though it's easy to take on a whole camp yourself). I will say, it is quite lengthy (even with some bonus mission that might have been bundled DLC, I don't remember), so if you find yourself liking it, there's lots to play. I thought it was pretty tedious after a few missions, even to try to play the wrong way, and just wanted to get through it to move onto the next game.","August 2, 2014","false","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I highly recommend playing on the hardest setting first time out for some challenge. CQB insingle player is flawed. A lot of objects to get caught up against.

Personally I steer clear from most of the generic realistic big name FPS titles so I am rating this based on it's own merits as a sniper.\nWhile probably devised using some random Tom Clancy name generator, it is actually a fun game. It does have it's flaws, occasional bugs (Nothing gamebreaking) and over sensitive AI but in essence it is a realistic, highly satisfying sniper/stealth simulator. Each perfectly aimed headshot is rewarding with a slow motion camera following the bullet until the evil generic mexican soldier falls to the ground with his hat flying off.\nThe graphics give the illusion of a crysis competitor through fancy shaders and choppy shadows but are impressive for a much lower budget title.\nA fun campaign mode, as you can guess multiplayer is just a giant campfest waiting for someone to move.

The graphics are rather pretty and the game runs well on older PCs too but the actual game contained in the engine isn't that interesting. Level design is incredibly linear and punishes every urge to explore with plenty of invisible walls and telescope-vision enemies, that often spot you from a huge distance if you stray from the tiny path offered by the developers. The sniping itself is a lot of fun at times and adjustable to your comfort level, despite the AI but regular gunplay which unfortunately occurs too is a drag and discourages further playing.\nThe story is of little help to keep you invested - even by the low standards of military shooters it's unengaging and keeps jumping back and forth between "characters" which I set in quotation marks because we never learn anything about the characters we are playing. I don't think I can even recall the name of the main character. Your main incentive as mr. soldier man is the voice in your head telling you to pop heads of south american baddies and after a while you kind of feel sympathy for the guys, since you, as the good guy, just show up with no authority, wreck their stuff and kill all their friends. It's somewhat feasible they might be the bad guys and it doesn't reach as far into the uncomfortable territory of the hyper-jingoistic splinter cell games but the story only has some shred of redeeming value if at the end it turns out you were part of a psychological experiment to determine how far you'd go if an authority figure tells you to.\n\nIn conclusion, Sniper: Ghost Warrior isn't deep enough as a stealth game and not fluid enough as an fps, marred by restrictive level design and a tedious single player campaign, however the multiplayer can be incredibly fun if you're not confronted by expert players. There aren't that many maps and modes but I enjoyed it more than any other generic fps in recent memory. There's a lot of room for improvement and the game is not a trainwreck by any means, but still I can't recommend it, unless you love multiplayer and you can get it really cheap.","November 27, 2014","false","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After playing this for a while I must say that besides the first map in single player campaign the game is rubbish and feels like it's in early alpha stage. The problem is that there are few levels after another that you do not even get to use sniper in sniper game, you are forced to use USAS or AK47 and they do not do any damage not even if you manage to get a perfect headshot. I recommend using the pistol instead because it is one hit one kill weapon. There are lots of bugs and enemies tend to shoot at you behind walls even if there is no way they should see you but if you crouch in bushes they can just walk over you and not notice you at all. The mechanics behind this game are broken. This title should have been cancelled or given even some polishing because single player is partly unplayable.

Was it worth it? For $5, I would say yes. Sniper: Ghost Warrior is an actioned filled sniper shooter that focuses on trying to provide realistic sniper combat as well as stealth. This game achieves at being fairly entertaining, enough so to keep me playing through the campaign. The storyline is decent, while predicatable at times. The level design was pretty good as a whole, and while the environments and scenery are quite beautiful, the game does feel very linear. That being said, most maps and missions do have some open areas and provide room to explore should you wish to do so. This game does have some major shortcomings nonetheless: it overall doesn't feel as polished as it could be, the voice acting is decent but the dialogue for enemies loops and isn't varied enough, the game has bugs and rendering issues, the AI is unbalanced, and I didn't find that the sniping realism was fully achieved.

You may not find yourself too deeply embroiled in the rather bland story or the so-so voice acting and writing but you will ache for the next moment that you get the chance to line up a bad guy in your scope. This effect is intensified by the harder levels of difficulty that add in things like windage and elevation and lack a helper diamond that lets you know where to aim. It goes from being a game to an art form and a true sniper will feel right at home. If you are not a born sniper then this game is a solid "meh" you will have fun but not as much. The multiplayer is more of an afterthought and as aforementioned the campaign is really just a sniper sandbox with some story thrown in. Also the bullet time function is cool but not Sniper Elite V2 quality.","October 12, 2012","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, it has an issue with the AI, but in all honesty, its not that bad, and is actually pretty hilarious at some points. All you people out there who look at a game expecting perfection are never going to find it because every game has flaws. This one had a rather bold one, but not a terrible one. It looks nice, plays well, and falls under the category of "slightly broken but still enjoyable." Hell, look at it this way, Skyrim is more broken in places than a crate that met Gordon Freeman, but Skyrim is still pretty much the ideal video game. Just cause something's broken, doesn't mean its bad. Also, the two dollar DLC fixes the AI, so there's that.

Was it worth it? For $5, I would say yes. Sniper: Ghost Warrior is an actioned filled sniper shooter that focuses on trying to provide realistic sniper combat as well as stealth. This game achieves at being fairly entertaining, enough so to keep me playing through the campaign. The storyline is decent, while predicatable at times. The level design was pretty good as a whole, and while the environments and scenery are quite beautiful, the game does feel very linear. That being said, most maps and missions do have some open areas and provide room to explore should you wish to do so. This game does have some major shortcomings nonetheless: it overall doesn't feel as polished as it could be, the voice acting is decent but the dialogue for enemies loops and isn't varied enough, the game has bugs and rendering issues, the AI is unbalanced, and I didn't find that the sniping realism was fully achieved.

After playing this for a while I must say that besides the first map in single player campaign the game is rubbish and feels like it's in early alpha stage. The problem is that there are few levels after another that you do not even get to use sniper in sniper game, you are forced to use USAS or AK47 and they do not do any damage not even if you manage to get a perfect headshot. I recommend using the pistol instead because it is one hit one kill weapon. There are lots of bugs and enemies tend to shoot at you behind walls even if there is no way they should see you but if you crouch in bushes they can just walk over you and not notice you at all. The mechanics behind this game are broken. This title should have been cancelled or given even some polishing because single player is partly unplayable.

If you just run and gun it can be quite disappointing. The enemy AI is really the weak point of the game. They can spot & shoot you from across the map and if you shoot one in a group, the others just seem clueless as to what is going on and just wait for you to shoot them too. Your rifle shots essentially go unheard; enemies don't enter a state of awareness after you shoot from distance. Your own squad immortally absorbs bullets and never die. The bullet-cam is a pretty cool feature and the game has respectable graphics. Good bargain bin shooter.","May 27, 2011","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics hold up pretty well. Enviroments look great. Despite reviews this game has flaws. The idea is to simulate gravity,wind, time of flight, and heartrate in long range shooting which does okay. Set up the perfect shot and you are rewared with a bullet cam view of the kil. I highly recommend playing on the hardest setting first time out for some challenge. CQB insingle player is flawed. A lot of objects to get caught up against. I found the single player ending very anti-climactic. Mutliplayer is fun when no one his hacking. This game has no anit-cheat support !!!  A lot of hackers in this game. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED !! This game does have potential for a great sequel if they fix things. I recommend this game if you need a distraction that is low cost. Sniper Elite, though dated on the graphics, is a better game.","February 4, 2011","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Personally I steer clear from most of the generic realistic big name FPS titles so I am rating this based on it's own merits as a sniper.\nWhile probably devised using some random Tom Clancy name generator, it is actually a fun game. It does have it's flaws, occasional bugs (Nothing gamebreaking) and over sensitive AI but in essence it is a realistic, highly satisfying sniper/stealth simulator. Each perfectly aimed headshot is rewarding with a slow motion camera following the bullet until the evil generic mexican soldier falls to the ground with his hat flying off.\nThe graphics give the illusion of a crysis competitor through fancy shaders and choppy shadows but are impressive for a much lower budget title.\nA fun campaign mode, as you can guess multiplayer is just a giant campfest waiting for someone to move. Don't pay more than $10 or $15 for it though if you value your money.","December 5, 2011","true","23.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Have not yet played multiplayer. I do recommend this game if you get it for a decent price. I got it as part of a bundle and think I definitely got a few dollars worth out of it and will still play it from time to time\n\nLooking forward to playing Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2. Hope they fixed the AI in the 2nd iteration.","January 9, 2014","true","48.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game allows you to do that to an extent. If there's a guy about 10 feets from you, and another guy 30 feet away, and you take out the guy who is 10 feet away from you, the guy from 30 feet away will not know. But that's if you're lucky enough to get him to fall silently. The game is fun all around, but really frustating at parts, and really test your stealth. I reccomend this to anyone who is super stealthy.","November 24, 2012","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But This game does not make most of my minimum requirements. The NPCS are to aware, graphics are tacky, and the story is vaige.

I think I got it during last year's holiday sale or something. I am thankful I did not pay full price for this.\n\nUnless you are using a sniper rifle or a pistol then you are going to have a difficult time hitting targets and there are segments that require you run around with an assault rifle or carbine.  Pistol range is so short its sickening too.  That story seems almost non-exisitant and I honestly don't know how this game got a sequel!\n\nYou know what it says on the back of the case for the Ghost Warrior 2?? "A ground-breaking follow up to the best-selling sniper game of all time."  If this game was the best selling sniper game of all time then there are a LOT of unhappy people.\n\nI got to say this probably is the one time I was happy the single player game was so short. I contemplated not finishing it, but I like to finish what I start when possible/tolerable.  I certainly won't be playing it again nor would I ever recommend it to anymore.\n\nThere are other things I could probably pick apart if I wanted to but others have touched on it fine.

The graphics are rather pretty and the game runs well on older PCs too but the actual game contained in the engine isn't that interesting. Level design is incredibly linear and punishes every urge to explore with plenty of invisible walls and telescope-vision enemies, that often spot you from a huge distance if you stray from the tiny path offered by the developers. The sniping itself is a lot of fun at times and adjustable to your comfort level, despite the AI but regular gunplay which unfortunately occurs too is a drag and discourages further playing.\nThe story is of little help to keep you invested - even by the low standards of military shooters it's unengaging and keeps jumping back and forth between "characters" which I set in quotation marks because we never learn anything about the characters we are playing. I don't think I can even recall the name of the main character. Your main incentive as mr. soldier man is the voice in your head telling you to pop heads of south american baddies and after a while you kind of feel sympathy for the guys, since you, as the good guy, just show up with no authority, wreck their stuff and kill all their friends. It's somewhat feasible they might be the bad guys and it doesn't reach as far into the uncomfortable territory of the hyper-jingoistic splinter cell games but the story only has some shred of redeeming value if at the end it turns out you were part of a psychological experiment to determine how far you'd go if an authority figure tells you to.\n\nIn conclusion, Sniper: Ghost Warrior isn't deep enough as a stealth game and not fluid enough as an fps, marred by restrictive level design and a tedious single player campaign, however the multiplayer can be incredibly fun if you're not confronted by expert players. There aren't that many maps and modes but I enjoyed it more than any other generic fps in recent memory. There's a lot of room for improvement and the game is not a trainwreck by any means, but still I can't recommend it, unless you love multiplayer and you can get it really cheap.","November 27, 2014","false","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The switches between two characters are the game's poor attempts to add variety.\n\nGhost Warrior is already a subpar game with sporadic A.I. behavior and some nonsensical design choices. Unfortunately, it gets worse during the infantry missions. The gunplay is atrocious and regenerating health saps the excitement of combat.\n\nThe game's saving grace is twofold.

I got mostly that. If you go into it with the same mindset you'll probably have some fun. (I played on Hard - it was a bit of a struggle at times.) The icing on this mediocre cake is when, I kid you not, the final objective is punctuated with a black screen with the text "The End" which made me laugh both times it happened (both the vanilla campaign and the DLC mission which was actually a lot better). Cue upside-down credits (not even joking).\n\nDetails, the Good:\n-The sniping mechanics are simple, sweet, rewarding. You get that cheesy bullet cam thing that a fair number of games have used, nothing new or special here. It's no Sniper V2 which was roughly same generation IIRC, with X-Ray damage report, but it's satisfying when you just made a ridiculous shot and watching it nail the guy between the eyes.\n-It's fairly pretty at a low graphical load. I kept wishing for a custom shader mod, and it may exist. LOTS of detail was put into the environments and it paid off.\n-On Hard it will give you a run for your money. It's one of those games where you are thankful that the quicksave button is there, on, and saving/loading is a matter of seconds at most.\n-Voice acting okay. I wish I didn't have to say this but a lot of these off-brand military games have horrible voice acting so it was nice to see it wasn't as bad as I went in expecting.\n\nThe Bad:\n-You will not get a Crysis-like experience out of your sniping, utilizing these vast beautiful landscapes to their fullest. It's fairly linear. Honestly, it didn't bother me, but I know there are people who will consider this much worse than I did so it's worth a mention.\n-The story is almost accurately non-existent. You don't have a lot of drama going on, much like a real Op would be. Again, may not be a problem for you.\n-Bugggggggy. I died at least once for falling onto something and dying for no apparent reason. The quickload happening within seconds made me not care too much with how often I found myself saving. Also, and this IS a problem, stairs are extremely tricky and complicated feats of engineering for our poor protagonists. You find yourself doing a little dance to get up basic stairs sometimes. Some other minor bugs I didn't really care about scattered throughout. It just felt low budget (probably was, again didn't bother me.)\n-Worst of all is the mandatory infantry scenes. Playing this on Hard was a niiiightmare. The game was clearly not built for the kind of Call-of-Duty-esque sections they forced upon you in the vanilla game. The DLC mission thankfully left this out. The only saving grace is that you can regenerate health up to 30/100 in cover. So you just need to hit your head against it a few times to get through.\n\nThe funny (and arguably most important piece of this review):\n-When you load the game, if you have the same glitch happen as I did, all the starting video and splash screen will be upside down. You will see a parallel universe where the sniping is happening upside down and nobody seems to mind. This happens again, as stated before, when you reach the credits which are also upside down.\nIf you are the kind of person who can see that when starting up a game for the first time and say "That's hilarious, I don't care, I just want to go sneaky beaky and snipe some dudes" then this is a game you will get a kick out of. If you need your games to all be polished high budget perfection, don't even get this on sale or you might implode.","June 3, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You could see what they were trying to do with it, but they didn't quite get there. To be fair, my first ever Sniper experience was slighty marred by the fact that the game isn't particularly compatible with win10 and the constant freezes, crashes and other little problems meant that my 14hr (twice as long as necessary) playthrough - from training to the end of unfinished business (dlc) - registered as about 25hrs on steam.\n\nPros: nice enough to look at on max settings;  the killcam never got tiring for me; it does mix up gameplay between sneaky sneaky and run and gun, with a couple of mounted shooting galleries thrown in for good measure.\n\nCons: gameplay can get repetitive; sometimes (especially prone) the scenery is so in your face that you can't see anything beyond the foliage in front of your face, which ends in tears;  some of the shot/AI behaviour is truly laughable.\n\nTL:DR - fun little game, can get extremely annoying/frustrating at times and no end of problems if playing on anything beyond win7!\n\nRecommended only for patient people.","February 27","true","25.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I Hope Sniper:Ghost Warrior 2 ( wich runs on cry engine 3) will be better. Strongly recomended for sniper fans( 7,5/10)","June 14, 2012","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It fits well into any military FPS operation based in a war torn jungle country. I had a great time playing through it, but wished that the grapple was used more freely and the maps were more open, there are a couple walls in places you wouldnt think, and certain things that you cant climb or step over. a little bit more QA in level design would have made this a GREAT game. I enjoyed it despite its faults its very minor faults.\n\nIf you enjoy tactical sniper like experiences you will enjoy this. 7/10","May 29, 2011","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You could see what they were trying to do with it, but they didn't quite get there. To be fair, my first ever Sniper experience was slighty marred by the fact that the game isn't particularly compatible with win10 and the constant freezes, crashes and other little problems meant that my 14hr (twice as long as necessary) playthrough - from training to the end of unfinished business (dlc) - registered as about 25hrs on steam.\n\nPros: nice enough to look at on max settings;  the killcam never got tiring for me; it does mix up gameplay between sneaky sneaky and run and gun, with a couple of mounted shooting galleries thrown in for good measure.\n\nCons: gameplay can get repetitive; sometimes (especially prone) the scenery is so in your face that you can't see anything beyond the foliage in front of your face, which ends in tears;  some of the shot/AI behaviour is truly laughable.\n\nTL:DR - fun little game, can get extremely annoying/frustrating at times and no end of problems if playing on anything beyond win7!\n\nRecommended only for patient people.","February 27","true","25.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got to say, rare are the games I installed and uninstalled before I finish them at least one. Sniper Ghost Warrior is one of them.\n\nThe good:\n\n-Graphics are "great" (for a 2010 game)\n-Sniping mecanism is OK.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-Enemy AI (they can walk over you without noticing you)\n-Accuracy with machine gun (why am I forced to use a machine gun in a Sniping game and how can you miss a target a couple of meters away!?)\n-Player seems 8 feet tall and 400 hundreds pounds sometimes. Can't walk through doors without having to jump or crawl!?\n-Enemy can spot you and and kill you with their machine guns when you can't see them yourself\n\nPlaying this game, I thought to myself I had better things to do. Even doing the dishes is more fun than this game... I prefer to uninstall it than finish it. I bought it in a pack with the other sniper releases of this company (I uninstalled Sniper: Art of Victory after the second level...). The worst thing is that Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 has equal Metacritic evaluations so it may finish in the garbage too.\n\nMy piece of advice here: This game doesn't worth 1$ so if you pay more than that, please spend the money elsewhere or else you'll be sorry, just like me having this uninteresting game in your library making you remember every time you launch Steam you paid some precious $$$ for this complete piece of trash.","August 14, 2015","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You could see what they were trying to do with it, but they didn't quite get there. To be fair, my first ever Sniper experience was slighty marred by the fact that the game isn't particularly compatible with win10 and the constant freezes, crashes and other little problems meant that my 14hr (twice as long as necessary) playthrough - from training to the end of unfinished business (dlc) - registered as about 25hrs on steam.\n\nPros: nice enough to look at on max settings;  the killcam never got tiring for me; it does mix up gameplay between sneaky sneaky and run and gun, with a couple of mounted shooting galleries thrown in for good measure.\n\nCons: gameplay can get repetitive; sometimes (especially prone) the scenery is so in your face that you can't see anything beyond the foliage in front of your face, which ends in tears;  some of the shot/AI behaviour is truly laughable.\n\nTL:DR - fun little game, can get extremely annoying/frustrating at times and no end of problems if playing on anything beyond win7!\n\nRecommended only for patient people.","February 27","true","25.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is lacking on many aspects, and if you're looking to purchase it, don't get your hopes too high up. But, right now, I'm talking about quality and certain gameplay aspects. Once you get past that, the core of the game is really unique. It's a different style than the usual Call of Duty. So, that's why I like it. In order to do well, you really have to put yourself in the game. I'm not sure how to say it... But I got really into the moment with this game compared to other games. You need to keep your eyes open, be careful with your decisions, and you need to be very careful from guards and try to go in "stealth mode". If you're just going in all braindead and not paying attention, not only will you not have fun because a big part of the game is really getting into it, but you'll just keep dying. Needs a lot of your attention. That's why lots of people say to only get SGW if you're a hardcore sniper fan. I'm not, but I got Art of Victory plus SGW 1 and 2 plus lots of dlc's for two bucks. So like, why not try it, right? Was not dissapointed. But can see why people would get dissapointed though. If you're really into this kind of stuff and can ignore things like graphics, AI, how badly the assault rifles fire, okay-ish story with no depth, etc. Like, you really just care about core gameplay? And like the style/genre? This can be a 9/10. But all of the components together, plus how the usual gamer would like it... I think it might deserve a 6/10. I wish there was a depend button for if I recomment the game. But if there isn't, I would say yes. It's worth it. Depends if you are the type of player I mentioned in my review and also on the price.

I am happy I got it with SGW2, although I haven't played SGW2 yet. So, I would not recommend this game, even when it is discounted.","February 9","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its both beautiful and fun. The game has not much to offer besides sniping but the sniping itself is superb! It has a little bit of story, sometimes you work on your own and sometimes with an ai friend. Its a good balance between full freedom and scripted events. There is no customization what so ever so you use the rifle you are given. You can pick up enemies weapons too which is a nice touch.\nAll in all, if you like sniping you must have this game!","May 14","true","11.8"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Frame drops to 1 FPS everytime NPC open fire, scope crosshair missing vertical line and unable to display variable zoom, invisible text in menu, up-side-down video. This game is barely playable on my PC and the only way I'm able to finish it is by using certain "method".\n\nThe story is corny and short. The gameplay is a mix between stealth using sniper rifle and action using assault rifle, so it's not pure sniper experience as I'm expected it to be.\n\nThis game uses Chrome Engine and Call of Juarez series (which also uses the same engine) has the same problems (missing texture, frame drops, invisible menu, up-side-down video, etc). So I deduce that the problem is the engine itself, not the game coding. Fortunately I got this game really cheap and the Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 that came bundled with this game run perfectly fine. FYI, Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 uses Cry Engine 3 and I recommend it instead this one.\n\nCONCLUSION :\nNot recommended.","June 4","false","18.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
