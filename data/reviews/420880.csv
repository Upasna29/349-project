What's next? Do I log into Steam and find an Early Access title that's just two wireframes no-clipping through each other? Will I hand over £6.99 for a sound file of an assault rifle burst and some concept art scrawled on the back of a napkin of a stick figure with 'ZOMBEE SERVAYVAL GAEM' scrawled over it? Maybe I'll pay £11.99 for a step-by-step in Russian of how to slap the game together myself in GameGuru, like the software equivalent of flatpack furniture.\n\nIf you need to see I MUST KILL failing harder at merely existing than anything in recent memory, here's my, uh... playthrough? Can I legally call it that? I don't know.

See update below.) Needs a lot of improvement. I mean I never have given this kind of review to any game.\n\nPros.\n-Good sound quality.\n-The art is okay. (Not that I judge the game based on the art.)\n-Has some sort of potential. (Somewhere?)\n-Free\n\nCons.\n-There is nothing to do. You talk like twice in the game. You can inspect like 1 or two things in the entire game.\n-Has an invintory but can't even pick things up\n-Has no objective at all.\n-Shows items that may be picked up such as a red mouse arrow but can't actually do anything with them.\n-Isn't really a game. More like a pop up book with several sentances.\n\n\nThis game has potential to be good but you can't do anything. I know it's not finished but you have to introduce a GAME not a slide show with music and instead of adding more animations and pointless updates. How about you put stuff that will call it a game. That's all. Don't download this 'game'. Unless you want to waste your time.\n\n-Update-\n\nSo appearently the people who made it has abandoned the game. As I said in my review that this game had lots of potential. It had decent music, interesting art style and could have had an interesting story. However this isn't really a 'game' even still. I know it's a work of progress it lack the essential to even be called a demo.  First off you cannot pick up or interact with anything which kinda weird concidering it's style. There is not realy story to it. No story of the character, the area or how everything happened.  I feel that I was a bit harsh on the whole don't download it unless you wanna waste your time. I do actually feel like they could have made a game. But they didn't introduce a game. Just a point and click where you move and that's really it. I can see it not be a game but a short story of sorts. Like a book. But it's not that either. As I said there is only like 5 lines in it at the beginning and that's it. They also removed the upstairs making it even interactive than before.\n\nI hate to hear that they just left the game entirely and truely I don't think it's fair that people can just make devolpers upset. Even something like the money hungry and terrible game (Which is also 'free' and actually much much worse that this could be. Because that is a finished game. This isn't.) TheHunter which has a terrible community  and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reviews it still has updates; awful ones.  But the people who came on here to expect a full or even half a game got really toxic due to it's lack of one. Which as I said it's fair. It isn't finished and now it isn't finished at all. Depite all this. Even with them leaving this game I still say no. Mainly because it's still not quite there. A lot of improvement much be taken even if it is a free game.","December 13, 2015","false","0.2"," 48 of 54 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","48","54","5","0"

However, as of this moment there is nothing to do in it. I found only a few objects that had a listed name when you cursor hover, but you cannot click or interact with any object in the game. This is unacceptable for a point and click adventure, early access or not. Sure the game is free to play, but there is not much of a game to find here.

The graphics, on the other hand, are ugly as sin, and if there's one thing a game with ugly as sin graphics wants to have it's a darned good STORY.  Now call me cynical, but I'm not quite sure if the ability to walk around a handful of rooms at a snail-like speed, while being completely unable to interact with ANYTHING, whatsoever, qualifies as a "story" just yet.  Hell, there was even one room which had a box of matches openly sitting on a table, and a crowbar poking out from under a closet, and if there were ever two items which just scream "pick me up, pick me up" in a horror game, that'd probably be them.  But no dice on this occasion.\n\nThe only things about this "game" which show even the slightest hint of potential are the enticingly tawdry title - perplexing grammar and all - and the sheer grubbiness of the premise itself (I mean, come on, haven't you always wanted to play Leatherface's fatter, dumber cousin?  I know I have).  One can only assume that somewhere down the track there'll be a GAME somehow attached to said title and premise, but there's also every chance the devs will discover crystal meth instead and lead unproductive, unfulfilled lives with no money, no hope, and no teeth.  Who knows?  Perhaps the world would be better off if they did...\n\nEven for the low, low price of FREE, I can only recommend this demo - if it even qualifies as such - to ♥♥♥♥wits like myself who enjoy writing reviews for bad games.  If you're NOT that kind of person, your time may be better served strolling into the kitchen, finding a suitably nasty cheese grater, and doing unspeakable things to your genital region.  Sure it might hurt, but at least you'll remember the experience, which is more than I'll be able to say about this demo in fifteen to twenty minutes from now.\n\nVerdict: 2/10.","December 1, 2015","false","0.6"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","76","19","25","9","1"

But I do not think it was wise to offer Early Access when there is very little of the game completed. All the game gives you is the opening of the game, where the butcher gives you a little background story, giving a hint to go inside due to the coming storm. There is not much you can do other than walk around, and there is very few things to interact with. My only pet peeve is when you go in the house, you cannot exit the house again. I will assume that is because there will be a feature that allows the butcher to enter the next day.\n\nIt would have been better if the creators had waited until they had a beginning scenario (a "First Mission", type thing), perhaps where you are able to get a proper taste of what the gameplay will be like. So the players have an idea of what they can expect from the finished future product.  But, I do believe this game is rather promising, and look forward to a finished product.

THIS IS ONE OF THEM,BECAUSE IT IS EARLY ACCESS! BUT IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU COULD NOT PLAY IT\nPros:\n+Good music for being horror game\n+ Graphics are good\n+ This atmosphere is good\n+ Because there ain't jumpscares on the start you just wait for them\n\ncons:\n-Graphics on the roof room are not good (?)\n-Unfinished and has some bugs\n\nShould be added:\n+Button where you can choose how loud you want to hear the game. I cannot find from the settings and cannot be found from the game. (SERIOUSLY THIS IS NEEDED!)\n+More details. Why can we press wooden tables or baskets, if it isn't doing anything?(cellar needs it the most)\n+Clicking should be something else than just walking around of the game. You should be able to pick up stuff, anything, which you need. Makes game to be more interested when you can pick up stuff.\n+Some sort of help, also known as "help"signs what you have to do, because I am sure that not even 50% will watch wikipedia. Like example stuff what you have to gather would have some sort of light or shine or red around it.\n+Better menu. It looks like windows xp menu,which makes player to think that this person/game is meant to be for windows xp computers. Would be good idea to make it to be in same colors as the game (?)\n+Moving to the other room should be whole right side/leftside/whatever than only upper part/down side of the screen\n+Story should be told all the time, where you go. It kind of stops when you enter to the house.\n+Stairs should have some sort of sign like example "HEY CLICK ME SO YOU CAN MOVE ON"\n+Also more story of the person, which we use and more flashbacks if he has done something.\n\nI can see that the makers are doing lot of work to make this game to work. It is brave to put unfinished games to be in early access. Hopefully I can update this review soon, when those errors has been fixed and game has improved.\nThat game is very artistic.","May 4","true","1.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I hate giving negative reviews, but I've had enough. When the game becomes playable I will be happy to finally play it and give a new review, but until then please remove it from steam. In a world where homeless and poverty stricken individuals have access to computers and internet, some people can only afford free to play games. This game has potential, but that's not enough if it's not functional.","December 28, 2015","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
