"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/427660/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3602 products in account","So, having put 14-15 hours into the game, having experienced 7/8 of the endings (including the true ending), 8/11 of the horror scenes, and 14/25 of the death scenes, here's my breakdown:\n\nTOP-LINE: This is a new Clock Tower game. It is unpolished and janky even by the series standards, but it's not incredibly buggy or anything, and literally feels like an old-school horror game from yesteryear that just fell out of a worm hole and released. It can stand proud among the company it comes from, is unapologetic of how old-school and cryptic it sometimes is, but chances are if you liked the Clock Tower games, you'll like this game. It takes a bit to get going, but when it hits its stride you may find yourself hooked.\n\nPROS:\n-Unapologetically Old-School. This won't be a pro for everyone, but the game targeted a niche fanbase of the Clock Tower games, and this game delivers what it promises to that fanbase. It feels like an old-school horror game, a Clock Tower game specifically, and it can stand proud with them since it's a good Clock Tower game. It has most of the same flaws the rest of the series does, but also the same strengths, and there is some new stuff sprinkled in, but it also doesn't modernize its vision.\n-There are some really cool/creepy scenes. I wouldn't define this game as scary (I didn't find the other Clock Tower games especially scary either I should mention, though), but there is some beautifully morbid scenes in this game. Some more surreal, some more gruesome. The gore is over the top. The game has a tendency of coming out of nowhere with a particularly nasty or horrific scene and sucker-punch you with it into some over-the-top horror scene (in a good way!). The game manages to tie everything nicely, while still feeling like it's creative enough to get away with what it wants. Notably, the game gets more twisted in the last fourth of the game compared to the rest of the journey.\n-The story: It's not going to win any awards or blow anyone away, but the story is actually quite nice. It's got a lot of subtle details, things in the environment, hidden double meanings in some dialogue or small touches to bring it together. The story is extravagant (as Clock Tower stories usually go), but told in a hushed, more mannered way. It is a multi-layered story with a lot of elements it manages to bring together, but not with a bang, but a whisper, and some of it may stick with you. I didn't find any of the characters unlikable, and it's telling I would often look forward to the voiced cutscenes (that were often the more cinematic ones). If you pay attention, you may get more out of the story than others. The true ending is a bit brief, but supported with everything else the game says.\n-The audio. The music is nice, with some stand-out tracks (maybe with the only disappointment I had being that the Scissorwalker's theme was a bit simple and repetitive), the voice acting is actually solid, hammy, but enjoyable. There's some very nice audio ques and sounds used to good effect in the game.\n-It's campy: Between over-the-top deaths, hammy voicing in some places, some silly scenes and dialogue exchanges, there is enjoyable camp here, and camp that fits perfectly with what was present in past installments of the series.\n\nMIDDLE:\n-The graphics. It actually looks a lot better than I was expecting, but the visual consistency is all over the place. Some areas look really good, while others look kind of bad.\n-Animations. Just like the graphics, the animation is all over the place. Some of scenes are actually expertly animated, there is some parts where they move like humans and respond and move in a realistic or creepy way... and then other times they look like dead-eyed fish people with no lip sync or sometimes movement that look like creepy dummies trying to imitate humans, or flailing about unrealistically or stiffly. It's some of the broadest in terms of quality animation I have ever seen, some of it looks great, some of it looks terrible.\n-Bugs: The game is unpolished, but it's actually not all that buggy. It has a few bugs, but nothing that's game breaking I found (sometimes you may need to reload a previous save though). I put this in the middle since while there are 3-4 bugs I ran into, none of them were major, and for playing the game for 16 hours, there were far less than I was expecting.\n-Scissorwalker: Maybe it's only because I've played the whole series before this, but I feel the Scissorwalker was less of a threat in this game than the other Clock Tower games. Not in such a huge way, I did die and he did threaten me, but it felt a bit more scripted here than usual, and I found it to not have quite the same presence as the Scissorman in previous games, but still an effective, cool, and interesting stalker antagonist.\n-Obtuse: Expect to replay segments of the game because you missed some easily missable key item that, without it, you will end up at a dead end or bad end in the game. It's unforgiving & stays true to this from the Clock Tower games. One new aid is when you go to load your game, there's a 'level flow' chart that shows the key points it branches at.\n\nCONS:\n-It's unpolished: The game is incredibly rough around the edges and unpolished. Fluctuating frame rate, small visual bugs, technical things, missing some options (Edit: Quit and return to menu have been added to the game as of Patch 1.02), jankiness... It's the game's biggest flaw for sure.\n-The controls are sometimes finicky: While I found the controls fine most of the time, there are some scenes you really need to fight with the controls. The worst would be sometimes when you needed to go to another fixed camera angle but it was hard to walk into it since you needed to click the very sides of the screen to get there.\n-Maybe the game is a bit too cryptic: The game doesn't explain much to you, it doesn't explain how to save, it hardly explains the stamina system, you can miss some minor thing and have to replay segments and try to figure out where it might be in long stretches of game; while they have a helpful flowchart on the load game screen, the game maybe is a bit too cryptic for its own good sometimes.\n\n---\n\nOVERALL: Liked it quite a bit, I feel like I'll want to replay this someday, I plan to get the last ending and find some more scenes I missed. I feel this stands tall with the rest of the series, and would look forward to replaying it in any sort of marathon replay of the whole Clock Tower series. It feels like a nice addition to Clock Tower, which is the biggest compliment I can give it. It's a good Clock Tower game, and one I think can stand with the rest of the series.\n\nAN ASIDE: I can't imagine people who never played these older horror/Clock Tower games to jump on this and fall in love with it immediately, it's a bit demanding and doesn't ease new players into the sort of game it is. It's a required taste and may only find a niche audience (I imagine trying to get someone who was grown and raised on modern horror games like Outlast, Slender, Amnesia, etc., may not quite understand this game's appeal, like trying to show someone raised on newer horror movies to enjoy some of the early classics of horror films), but for those who've wanted more games like this in their life, this is probably the truest old-school horror game to have released in years. Jank and all, you'll have a hard time finding a horror game that's this true to the old-school design philosophies of horror games like NightCry released in the last several years. I imagine this title will gain a cult status down the line, and be brought up as part of the Clock Tower series.\n\nBEST PART OF THE GAME: Chapter 3, and some of the twisted horror moments in that chapter, interesting rooms and hidden scenes, some of the visceral imagery in some of the bad endings.\n\nWORST PART OF THE GAME: All of its technical problems and general roughness that hopefully gets patched out some.","March 30","true","16.8"," 79 of 99 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","79","99","5","12"

Now the day comes and it releases, so I decided to give it a try!\n\nWell... it's not good. It's not BAD, either? It's just not good. It functions, I didn't hit anything I'd really describe as a bug (other than perhaps a performance issue), it didn't crash, and the controls more or less work the way they seem to be intended to work.\n\nThe problem is that the difference between a bad game and a good game is often just polish, and this game has no polish anywhere. It's all jank and awkward camera angles and unclear objectives and just plain unpleasant gameplay. If executed correctly, this game could be good, but right now there's tons of stuff they need to fix/change and I can't imagine they'd release it for sale if they had a serious plan to fix those things anytime soon - why risk a bad launch?\n\nDuring my couple hours with the game I died a few different ways, saw a few people get murdered, interacted with some NPCs, got some phone calls, and explored a couple floors of the ship. There were some jump scares mixed in there and small amounts of narrative - the one puzzle they threw at me worked fine and I found it straightforward to solve instead of annoying. So that's nice. But otherwise... none of it really worked. The game never spooked me, I never felt any real tension, just annoyance at the camera and the awkwardness of the control scheme. The last straw was that I hit the first 'ending' and it's the most pathetic fart of a denouement I've ever seen. I had to go back and replay it because I couldn't comprehend what had just happened.\n\nIf this game were more competently executed, I'd say it's at least worth a look for Clock Tower fans... but right now nobody should buy this game. Don't buy this game.","March 29","false","1.8"," 113 of 173 people (65%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","65","113","173","5","14"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Qineuro/recommended/427660/","Qineuro","Sesame Frownshoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Qineuro/","495 products in account","It's a shame to see this game getting so many negative reviews.  I've been having a lot of fun with NightCry, in great part because it's exactly what's advertised.  If you've ever played any of the original Clock Tower games (on SNES and PS1, before Clock Tower 3 took things in another direction), you can expect a modern-looking game in the classical style.  A lot of the conventions and genre trappings haven't been updated at all, and I think that's where some of the dissonance comes from.\n\nWith NightCry, you can expect obtuse, illogical puzzles, fixed camera angles that often impede your control, point and click navigation instead of direct movement, an (occasionally) extreme level of difficulty, and a lot of bad endings that you won't immediately understand why you're getting.  If you're able to look past these things, you'll find a charming game with a very morbid, distinct sense of humor and a whole lot of heart.  The writing is just the right level of tongue-in-cheek, and the voice acting is hammy enough to be in on the joke without feeling stilted, cartoonish or absurd.  Early screenshots and trailers had led me to wonder, but the game has a surprising amount of visual polish and I find myself really admiring the aesthetic.  The real-time shadows are particularly impressive and add a lot to the atmosphere.  This isn't a AAA title, but if you've taken even a cursory look at the store page and read this far, you shouldn't be expecting one.\n\nSound design in a horror game is incredibly important, and NightCry's use of audio deserves a special mention.  It's clear that a lot of care went into all of the sounds in this game, and everything fits together beautifully.  From the distinctive menu sounds, to the sharp, jarring *clink* and *slice* of scissors you hear almost immediately after beginning the game, from the terrifying quality of the "chase" music to the unexpected stingers that accompany jump scares, in my opinion NightCry's strong use of sound is one of its greatest assets.  Outside of a few particular moments the original Clock Towers never managed to scare me much, but in part thanks to the fantastic sound design, NightCry has been inspiring a refreshing sense of dread in me as I've been playing.   If you can allow yourself to let your guard down, NightCry finds some real and surprising ways to get under your skin.  The ability to be meaningfully tense and frightening outside of the cheap "Gotcha!" moments is something that few horror games nowadays can lay claim to.\n\nThere's flaws here for sure.  Though it's improved over the last few updates, the game is still buggy in a lot of places and prone to occasional crashes.  Some of the puzzles can be very frustrating, and could probably benefit from an in-game hint system.  Though I see it as a strength, the game design is definitely 10 or 15 years behind the times, and the clear product of another era.  If you're a Clock Tower fan, though, none of this should really matter.  NightCry is a faithful new installment in the franchise.  As much as I love and appreciate Haunting Ground, I'd call this the real "Clock Tower 4" that we never got back in the day.  This is a really cool game with a lot to offer, and if you're capable of checking your expectations at the door, any fan of oldschool horror and adventure games can find a lot of fun with this title.","April 19","true","17.4"," 49 of 68 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","49","68","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dark105/recommended/427660/","dark105","LordKardok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dark105/","20 products in account","Note: I have only reached chapter 2.\n\nFor the most part the game is good. The graphics are okay, but not cutting edge. The voice acting is good. The controls can be a little difficult to deal with at first, but you'll ween yourself into them after walking around for a few minutes.\n\nThe game does not tell you the controls, as far as my experience goes, so you'll need to teach yourself before getting to the first chapter (technically you start in the prologue). Once the first chapter starts, the game will give you instructions on how to move and interact while being chased. The game does not point you in any directions other than through interacting with objects or dialogue during cutscenes, so pay attention and attempt to not skip any details.\n\nThere is no menu in the game, or at least I couldn't figure out which key opened the menu. You can pause the game by using the P key. You can skip cutscenes by using the SPACEBAR. The inventory becomes available as you find items. The only real flaw with the exclusion of a menu is that there is no way to escape the game, even from the main menu. If you are in window mode you can just close the window, but if you are in full screen mode, you either have to Tab+Alt out of the game and close it, or Alt+F4.\n\nThe only bug I've encountered is during a struggle with the main enemy of the game. You have to click a button quickly in order to push off your pursuer, however, if an object that is interactable is behind that button, your character will interact with it and die immediately afterwords. For example, this bug occured while in room 301, in the bedroom, where I got cornered and somehow interacted with the bed while fighting off the Scissorwalker. There may be other bugs, I do not know yet.\n\nThere seems to be a graphical issue with the main character's hair and the lighting that causes FPS to drop. This may not occur for everyone, as I did not experience this issue, however, some people I know, and some in the community are reporting this issue.\n\nThe story is suspensful as it sets up multiple suspects to being the Scissorwalker (my money is on grandma in the elevator). The gameplay is very similar to it's predecessors of the Clock Tower franchise: running from an unkillable enemy, hiding, and solving puzzles. The horror is strong in this game as well. Fighting off the Scissorwalker sometimes becomes necessary, but it will quickly drain your stamina and eventually kill you. Even with full stamina, you can still fall to the floor and end up spending your extra stamina picking yourself back up. If you fall and have no stamina, you're likely to die. Sometimes you have to solve a puzzle while the Scissorwalker is chasing you, and sometimes you have to interact with a "difficult to click on" object. The Scissorwalker's name is also ironic, considering it's walking speed is that of your running speed, and it can occasionally run after you to close any large gaps you may have made between it and yourself.\n\nHopefully, in a future patch, we can see at least some of these issues dealt with.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention three things.\n1.) You auto save during checkpoints, but you can manually save using a "phone charger." You get access to your phone later in the game, which gives you a light, and allows you to communicate with your friends, or at least the ones still alive.\n2.) The history section of the main menu displays all the outcomes of important choices you made, and you can see the path you've taken in the save menu.\n3.) When hiding, a heart will be displayed. The game does not mention what it's used for, but you must keep the heart as centered as possible to keep yourself from being discovered by the Scissorwalker. Some hiding spots will not always display the heart, which means the Scissorwalker will ignore those spots.","March 29","true","0.9"," 65 of 100 people (65%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","65","65","100","6","1"

Everything is said in the other reviews for this game. And frankly, this game took too much of my time already.\n\nTerrible controls in combination with terrible camera angles = gamebreaking. Especially when a big part of the game is being chased down to corridors by the scissor lady.  No WASD controls. Inferior graphics and odd character movement, cheesy characters, only voiceacting in cutscenes, no music, clipping, very frustrating stamina system.\n\nI'm gonna ask for a refund and will keep my eye on reviews.

Before that, it was near enough unplayable so it is good that the developers worked hard to fix this up fast.\n\nIt is an old school Japanese survival horror/point & click game so don't expect any miracles from a technical point of view here. If you recall playing the first Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Alone in the Dark, Clock Tower games etc, it is very much in that kind of bracket. A sort of throw back to that style of game design which I really love. Sure, its a bit cheesy but still a lot of fun to play so try it out because it is also quite scary as well. The director of the Grudge films (Takashi Shimizu) helped develop the story on this game and it was created from crowd funding on Kickstarter.\n\nThe story follows a number of characters onboard a cruise ship as you try to help them unravel the mystery of the appearance of a murderous entity called the Scissor Walker who could jump out at you at any time and give chase. You can only run and hide or use objects in your surroundings to keep him at bay but he will return again at some point so it keeps you on your toes and on the alert as you never know when he might pop back up. The game doesn't hold your hand either so you will need your brain in gear to think about what to do next to progess onwards in certain areas.\n\nThe outcomes of your actions can lead the story down different paths as well. This meaning that there isn't just one set way the game can pan out. There are multiple possibilities on where the plot goes next depending on if you find certain items or not or talk to a particular NPC etc. This adds good replay ability as you obviously cannot run through all scenarios in one playthrough and this is a fun plus point to the game.\n\nIt isn't a perfect game by any means. The character interactions can sometimes be pretty cringe worthy and the movement is also a bit wooden and primitive looking at times. There is also an inconsistency in the voice work. Sometimes cut scenes have voice acting where you hear what is being said, then in the next, you only read subtitles to know what is going on. A strange choice to do that as some scenes play out in silence but you still see the characters moving and gesturing onscreen. I feel they should have either done one or the other here but that's just me. It doesn't affect the game too badly to be fair. I can excuse it but others may find this a bit of an issue.\n\nNightCry uses the point & click mechanic so if you are hoping for a free movement game here, you might want to reconsider. But, if you like this game style or fancy trying it out, then it is definitely worth giving NightCry a go.","April 22","true","21.5"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","20","26","0","0"

So I am one of those who have seen the end, now I can judge. ;-)  I do prefer the non-mainstream indie, obscure, weird and “unpolished” sort of (horror) games. That’s what you get.\n\nNightCry is an old school, third person horror point and click action adventure with clunky controls and animations. (In line with the “Clock Tower & Resident Evil” series.) But this is part of the game design and art style.\n\nCheckpoint and save game feature is surprisingly well designed, so it’s less frustrating to start over, after you messed up. (Game Over/Dead End screen is your best friend…;-)) Your objectives are not always clear outlined and the sometimes illogical puzzles can be challenging. There are still (non-game-breaking) bugs (missing mouse over markers) that make life hard for you to proceed.

But it falls flat on it's face.\n\n1) first thing I'm going to bring up is the controls, Like the original clock tower game, this relies on a point and click control scheme, No other buttons are used (Except escape to quit, and P to pause) That might not sound like a terrible thing, and in some cases it isnt, But when you're being chased by a maniac with a giant pair of scisors, you need responsive quick controls. The mouse doesn't offer what you need in the 3d world, which brings me to problem 2. It's in desperate need of controller support.\n\n2) Bad camera angles. Like the resident evil games of yesteryear, this game relies on a fixed camera angle to give both tension and dramatic flare. This in and of itself isn't terrible, but with the pont and click control scheme mentioned above, it makes it very difficult some times to get to certain areas quickly, because you can't really click on it, To make it worse, you're being chased during certain points, and can't see where the monster is, meaning lights out.\n\n3) the monster. The monster itself is exactly what i was expecting, Scary and mysterious, and relentless. Perfect for this kind of game. But with the camera angles and bad controls, it makes it difficult to get away from in a hurry. He's usually pretty easily evaded until you can find a spot to hide, Unfortunately, You can only hide in a spot once before he destroys it, giving you limited encounters, You don't know whats going to trigger the encounter, so when you are just looking for items to complete the area, you could unintentionally get him after you. It feels as though if you get him chasing you more then once, you may as well start the game over, cause you're gonna get cut.\n\n4)  Lack of direction. Right from the start, there didn't seem to be any real sense of direction, not a lot of subtle hints, just click around and hope you find something that gives you a clue. This isn't a bad thing either in and of itself, but because clicking on certain things causes the monster to spawn, and you only have limited hiding spots to get away, it means that if you don't know what you're doing and your clicking willy nilly through trial and error, you're gonna run out of hiding spots and once again, get cut.\n\n5) WTF. Seriously, WTF. Warning, this part contains early game spoilers, Don't scroll on down if you're worried about it.\n\nThe characters don't seem to react properly to the WTF ness. Early game the owner of the cruise ship asks you for a lighter...to boil his prosthetic eye, which he has out, in the open, on a bunsun berner, in the middle of the freakin' bar. Not only does your character, who is some eye candy blond in a backless, gravity defying sloot dress, help with this predicament, She seems completely okay with this, like thats just a thing people do. The game is full of moments where it just seems normal to be surrounded by the bizarr, A little WTF reaction would have gone a long way.","April 4","false","0.9"," 28 of 47 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","28","47","0","3"

This is what happens when somebody tries to do something they can't possibly accomplish. I mean, seriously, why even go for 3D if you can't make it look good? Just take a look at Knock-knock, Silence of the Sleep, Neverending Nightmares, The Charnel House – they all are 2D and they benefit from it, because their developers had spare time to work on the aspects that matter. But, even if you go for 3D, why butcher the player's experience by shoving in so much more tech than you can handle? Yeah, hair physics and dynamic shadows look great, but 30 fps and aliased edges absolutely do not.\n\nWhat about modding? It's a definitive aspect of PC gaming. This game would've gained so much more longevity and popularity if it had at least SOME kind of modding support. All the design flaws could've been dealt with if full support was introduced – while still not sacrificing the original creative ideas, since mods are optional.\n\nThis was just technical stuff. Don't even get me started on completely nonsensical and counterproductive design decisions, laughably contrived story, and utterly horrendous controls (in a THIRD PERSON POINT-AND-CLICK game, how can anyone screw that up?). This is simply not acceptable in 2016.\n\nThe good sideDespite all this, NightCry is oddly captivating. I'm yet to finish the game, and it will take me some time (since I keep stumbling into bugs I report only to be told it's all intentional), but, as it is, I can't stop playing it. The atmosphere of this game is only comparable to that of Silent Hill 2 or The Suffering (and probably the original Clock Tower series, which I, sadly, was not able to play).\n\nShould you buy it?Don't buy this game for $15.

While it does definitely have the atmosphere of a classic survival horror game, it suffers a lack of playtesting and illogical event progression. It has potential, but to call the release premature would be an understatement. While they are already busy patching things, some of the issues run deep enough that there can be no fix beyond a re-think of the core approach. I seriously advise looking deeper into the game's state before you risk a purchase.\n\nThose of you who are familiar with older gems are probably no stranger to awkward cameras, high profile bugs and nonsensical triggers, but we usually forgave them because the game managed to outshine it's flaws. However in this game, the camera is such an issue that it can really get in the way of losing yourself to the game. The controls are point-and-click based, but if the camera doesn't change to allow you to near your desired destination, you will simply be unable to go there. For example, if a corridor forks in two directions but the camera nests itself inside one path, you may simply have no ground to click on (and clicking too close to the walls may send you in only god knows what direction). You will have to wrestle with the camera, as well as occasional invisible walls or no-walk zones. This can easily happen while an antagonist is chasing you.\n\nThankfully your cursor has a forgiving area for revealing interaction points, but memories of pixel-hunting come back when things hide themselves just outside of your strangled camera, or when one interactible's field blocks another, or when one intercepts your attempted click to move somewhere. Then there is the game progression. What the creators wanted you trigger before you can progress is often very hard to understand. Forgetting to repeatedly interact with even token scenery items can cost you a lot of pointless wandering and backtracking, made worse if there is no reasonable way to discern the requirements. Deliberately re-interacting with everything until you run out of new text will become second nature, even though each interaction causes a pause for a blink of fade-to-black (both before and afterwards), and there isn't always a way to skip individual lines of description (only the whole thing, sans the fade).\n\nI don't mind a chapter's progression being linear, as that lets the creators write in a much more controlled manner, but NightCry falls too far into the trial and error side of things. Initially, interacting with certain objects will give you typical "nothing to do here" responses that suggests they are just props. I'm sure you know the kind. "Nothing out of the ordinary", "Just a clean table", "A stack of magazines. I never read these" and "I can't waste time here!" Only later on you may be required to re-check one of these 'prop' items to cause the story to proceed, even when nothing immediately suggests you should do so. I hate hand-holding as much as the next gamer, but breadcrumbs in a maze are always a godsend. Too much time lost and you simply disengage. Those footprints? Yeah. Go back and interact with them twice more for some flavour text, otherwise you're going nowhere.\n\nFor instance : (minor?) SPOILERS for chapter 1 ahead.\nAn initial pass of some nearly identical rooms will tell you (paraphrased) "This briefcase is stuck shut, no need to open it anyway". Each room has a briefcase with the same reactions. However you will need to re-check one of them later, and you will be unable to progress unless you do so. I only knew to do this because the game eventually took mercy and gave me a hint phonecall after hobble-wandering the corridors forever. Another example was having a set of keys to a cafe, only the cafe was already open access. The cafe had a second floor and she even notes "the stairs are only blocked with a rope cordon" but then says "but I have no reason to go up there", despite the current goal being to search for a way to a different floor. You can only use these stairs if you interact with one of two background prop-style brochure stands that you passed just outside the starting room of the game. Both of which previously prompted you with a stock "Why would I ever take one of these?" type response. After finally having overcome this, I got up the stairs and unlocked a door and proceeded onwards, only to hear the sounds of my character being murdered behind the closed door with no elaboration. I'm still not certain, but I think the game wanted me to have my light turned on when I entered the room? Which is strange, because previously it allowed me to turn it on manually once I was inside so I could conserve battery in light areas. On my next attempt, my character didnt spontaneously die, but the room was totally empty. Yeah.\n\nI want to like it, I really do. There's some real nostalgic heart to this game, but the layered jaggedly rough edges made even the first chapter feel like a tedious ordeal. You can only put so much of this down to deliberately following classic game footsteps. I feel bad for being critical of these guys, but I can't in good conscience glaze over the utterly raw state of Nightcry.","March 30","false","5.6"," 24 of 41 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","24","41","0","0"

There is definitely a serviceable game there, but it NEEDS more time in the oven. First off, the game defaulted to my onboard graphics card rather than my gaming one. I fixed this by launching via Explorer with a right-click rather than via Steam. They aren't fancy by any means, but I am perfectly fine with the graphics as they are presented. That being said, the game managed to turn me off within the first twenty seconds - a buxom blonde walks through a door and her hair ripples in every direction, clipping through her softball-size chest multiple times. She takes a step and the ends of her hair violently whip into the air like Medusa's snakes. I'm watching an in-engine cutscene, and I'm surprised that no one looked at this and thought it needed some polish. I take some painfully slow steps around the room (she walks like a satyr, but that's either because she's drunk, in heels, a combination or both, or just some inhuman animation,) and talk to the coatcheck. The voice acting seems perfectly acceptable. I click on him again, and the woman stares at him while he continues focusing on his work. They apparently have a conversation as diagloue appears along the bottom, but the voice acting is gone and they aren't moving their mouths or even displaying some type of speaking animation. I'm okay having voice acting only in major scenes, ala Parasite Eve, but two people standing motionless just boring holes into each other with their eyes while dialogue runs is a major turn-off. The silence becomes maddening - I understand that the Kickstarter didn't raise enough money for ambient noise, but it's odd and a bit boring wandering around a giant cruise ship kept company only by your footsteps. I do exploring around and discover that I can run somewhere by double-clicking, but I notice that in the 3D environment the game will grossly misinterpret where I want to run and I end up in a wall or doing an about-face. I went down a long hallway and was doing okay, but when I turned around I was at the mercy of the camera; it never shifted when I turned around, so there were only about three feet (to scale) between my character and the edge of the screen. As a result, a hallway that took me six clicks to get down (12, actually, because I was running,) took me 24 (48, because I was running) to get back down because I could only move three feet at a time until the camera finally changed. The Scissorwalker looks great, but I couldn't find the time for fear because I was so busy drunkenly careening through the ship fighting the camera and the poor navigation with the point-and-click interface. I REALLY would like to play this game as it was envisioned, but it needs A LOT of polish, and since it has been already been released, I'm not very hopeful.","April 2","false","0.5"," 37 of 66 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","37","66","5","0"

I'm very sorry to say that it's not just that I'm merely disappointed: I'm rather displeased. This game is borderline unplayable. It's unpolished and the controls don't feel right, and this is coming from a longtime fan of point-and-click adventure games (let alone the Clock Tower series, having started with the Super Famicom classic). But I just didn't have much fun with the twelve hours I've spent.\n\nI'm only writing this review now because I've reached an unwinnable situation: NightCry has literally pulled a "Duck Amuck" (yes, from Looney Tunes) and erased much of the scenery, to the point where I can't progress. I'm stuck. I could reload a checkpoint and try again, but overall this game simply does not feel like a finished product. It feels like a work-in-progress, and I'm very disappointed with the results.\n\nThere are some things of merit, to be sure. I love the design of the Scissorwalker, but it's a shame that she often gets stuck in doorways, giving me plenty of time to recover stamina and evade. The chapter with Leonard was the most interesting to me, and some of the visuals look good... while other parts look more drab.\n\nBut the glitches have rendered NightCry pretty much unplayable to me. The controls are so awkward (again, this is coming from a longtime fan of the genre) that I DREADED the Scissorwalker sequences, but not because I was scared--because I didn't want to get even more frustrated. The unpolished vibe that surrounds this game, along with the horrendous glitches, all thoroughly ruin the horror and tension that a true Clock Tower successor needs.\n\nI'm very sad to say--and I mean it, because I really wanted to like this game--that I'm strongly disappointed. I appreciate the idea of a Clock Tower successor, but I'm dissatisfied.\n\nIf you would like to see visual references to some of the problems I've mentioned, please refer to the image links below.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=656385414\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=657700202","April 2","false","12.1"," 19 of 32 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","19","32","0","0"

The characters move slow and you can get a bad ending early in the game by not picking up a certain item.

NightCry is about as indie as it gets, and it shows in the presentation. The graphics aren't fully polished (Monica's 'scared' face looks halfway between a blow-job robot and a Macy's mannequin), the controls take a little bit of time to get used to, the optimization isn't perfect, and there are occasional framerate spikes. Also, the game doesn't tell you how to save, and you have to either ALT-F4 or ALT-Tab + Close in order to exit the game. NightCry has a very rough start, too, and takes a little bit to really reel the player in.\n\nIf these things are a dealbreaker, I can understand. It didn't scare me off, but it isn't for everyone.\n\nNow, let's look at the positives.\n\nThis game is gloriously cheesy. Yeah, I consider that a positive. The voice acting is purposely bad, with silly death scenes and spooks right out of an 80's slasher or goresploitation movie. The soundtrack only adds to this, with one track directly referencing the Friday the 13th chase theme (You know the one). This is a game made by horror and slasher movie fans for other horror and slasher movie fans, and the enthusiasm and love for the genre is infectious, and never fails to put a smile on my face.\n\nThe way the game is structured isn't that bad, either. For as much as I see complaints about the game's checkpoint system, I think it's a good idea. In harder areas, it gets downright generous with those save points, and if you're diligent enough to save after every major event / getting a new item, then you will never have to worry about retracing your steps to get certain items after you die. The puzzles are (mostly) straightforward, and the use of social media and cell phones is pretty clever in a game of this type.\n\nAlso...this game's a Clock Tower sequel in all but name. It feels like a Clock Tower game, controls like a Clock Tower game, and is rough around the edges like a Clock Tower game. Clock Tower fans will have little to no trouble adjusting to the Scissorwalker, and new players will learn pretty quickly.\n\nI love this game to death, but I know it isn't for everyone. I was a little disappointed at first, but I warmed up to it, and it now sits proudly with the other (good) Clock Tower games in that special shelf in my heart dedicated to spooky horror fun.\n\nCheck it out if you want to find a new Halloween favorite.

Even after two patches there are some left, but it doesn't make the game unplayable at least.\n- Not fully voice acted. There's voice acting only in parts.\n- Stiff animations.\n- Too easy QTEs.\n- Chapter 2 has no real dangers aside from traps, and drops in intensity compared to chapter 1 and 3.\n- Set spawn points for the Scissorwalker makes it less scary.\n\nPersonally I would have loved it if there were more randomness to it, like it were in Haunting Ground where the stalker actively searched for you at all times on the map. When I played I only think this happened once during chapter 1.\nI did have a lot of fun playing it, the gore is over the top and amusing to those who enjoy slasher horror. I probably ended up liking it more than I thought I would at first, as the mystery of the game got me hooked and I was curious to see what happened.\n\nIf you like horror games, then get this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evil_incarnate/recommended/427660/","evil_incarnate","Evil incarnate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evil_incarnate/","1022 products in account","NightCry comes at me as one of the most disappointing, frustrating, illogically designed horror and point and click games I've played in the past decade. This game gets so much wrong and with the talent behind the game is why I'm shocked as I was expecting a higher standards product.\n\nLet's get this out the way. NightCry isn't a good game - at all - and in fact crossed over to be unplayabley buggy. The controls... what on Earth were the developers thinking? This is bare bones point and click, no confirmation selection and the horrendous, inaccurate reading of where I click my mouse and where the character moves is awful. This is especially the case when turning sharp corners, clicking on the perimeter of the screen, or wanting to do a 180 degree turn. It isn't unplayable, but it's frustrating, this feels more like an after thought. This can be solved by allowing WASD movement, controller support, and learning how to code.\n\nThe puzzles... what possessed these people when they were designing them? Not only will you pick up useless, distracting items, but most puzzles involve just clicking the item in your "inventory" (which isn't actually an inventory, just a lazily-drew on-screen box with the picture and title of the item) and click the thing in front of you. There's a couple of puzzles that require thinking outside the box, such as the suitcase and call-for-help, which were pretty okay. When you look at the previous Clock Tower games, incl. Haunting Ground, they had actual puzzles beyond drag'n'drop or click an item to use it.\n\nFurthermore, and probably the most hair-ripping, depressing-inducing, mind-acheing mechanic of the game is the finite stamina system. ♥♥♥♥ me sideways, this is one of the worst stamina-use mechanics I've ever ever seen, worse than The Evil Within's. You'll fall over automatically when you're out of stamina and it takes a second to five or so seconds just to get back up whilst you're sitting there holding left-click barking at the screen to get up. By the time you do - whilst now being on low stamina - there is an extra second delay where the character just for no ♥♥♥♥ing reason freezes; allowing the scissorman to catch up to you. Then there's the "hiding spots" which are far between, and the "traps" which I never used because I just kept reloading my previous save. Why did I reload? Because being stalked by the scissorman is a chore, it's not fun, in fact it's so infuriating that I hit my head on the desk out of sheer temperament. There's little excitement as per previous entries in this franchise, it's far too slow paced and repetitive for me to be excited and enthralled being stalked by a scissorman who will insta-kill you for being curious about exploration. Which was a mistake in hindsight, never ever extremely punish the player for exploring - especially in a survival horror game.\n\nNext... is why the game is unplayabley buggy. I encountered a game-breaking glitch right at the very end of chapter 2 when you walk out the exit door. I won't spoil beyond that, but I know that once the cutscenes are over you're onto chapter 3 as a new character. However, with me, it breaks to a game over screen after the third cutscene and I'm back in the last room. I've tried replaying scene 2 again - which didn't work - and then the entirety of chapter 2 which again: didn't work. I tried everything except a complete restart because I don't think my sanity can handle chapter 2 again. By the way, which is one of the worst sub-plot, protagonist-switches that I've ever seen; topping both Metal Gear Solid 2 and Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness. That's right, Clock Tower, the series known to take its inspirations and game design influences from Giallo horror, Japanese horror, and plays on the dismal-in-distress trope, is nowhere to be seen in this game. The game cuts chapter 1 where the story only just began to pickup and you're now playing some old jackass nobody ever cared about, neither did the developers ever mention Leonard prior to release. Thrown into a horribly written, pointless, filler sub-plot that doesn't add to the current events, but backstory which could have been told in a minute or two. I hate Leonard, I hate chapter 2 and I hate the game-breaking glitch I've hit right at the end of chapter 2.\n\nOther annoyances incl. the graphics. It doesn't know whether it wants to be high fidelity, or a mix of some kind of cel-shade or not. This inconsistency is plagued throughout the game, both gameplay and graphics. And inconsistent is what this game is. It's a mix of what were popular genres, but doesn't stylise or , ahem, "fuse" these together to create an original, unique, coherent product.\n\nSurvival horror and point and click are two favourites of mine, as well as old school movement with fixed cameras, and I even consider the first Clock Tower and Haunting Ground to be masterpieces. But no way in Hell does this game live up to any of them, or any horror game released up to this point. This game shames the Clock Tower series and is an embarrassment similar games ala Silent Hill, Siren, etc. I'm also a Kickstarter backer, and the key members of this project are people I love, and it is gut-wrenching that I'm saying this game is pretty awful. But I'm mentally sick of this game now, so much frustration and hype, all for nothing. The future of survival horror is looking bleak right now if even the masterminds of the genre can't get it right.\n\nNow, there are positives to this game. The music, which is under-used, is right on spot. It'll send a chill down your spine as did mine, the musician did an amazing job at fitting her work to this game. Also the copy-pasted male character model that looks like DmC Dante was unintentionally hilarious, and totally not immersive breaking, which added light comedy elements. But seriously, all I can think this game has going for it is its soundtrack, which you should totally download.\n\nAll in all, I hate myself for saying this, but NightCry isn't a worthy successor to a masterful series, neither does it do justice to the horror genre, and gets about everything wrong with trying to mimic it. These types of games are right up my alley, but I need to call products out that don't meet expectations after so much hype I created for myself given the circumstances. My final score is 2/10, I don't even recommend this to fans of Clock Tower, unless you want to just see how bad this game is in comparison.","March 30","false","5.1"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","22","39","0","0"

While Clock Tower Ghost Head (Struggle Within outside of Japan), Clock Tower 3, and Haunting Ground tried, there was something holding all of them back. While NightCry, having to start out by being crowdfunded, might not have looked successful, it had the benefit of an all-star team that is led by original series architect Hifumi Kono.\n\nThe part that made me happy at the end was that I finally got a taste of the same feelings that I had when I first played Clock Tower. With a few additions to separate this game from the original Clock Tower games, the experience of playing this game made me feel good about playing horror games again. The game has its flaws, but even these flaws (which I'll mention later) didn't stop me from enjoying what the game gave.\n\nI'll start with the setting: the story largely takes place on-board an ocean liner called the Oceanus, where a party is being held. The party is brought to a complete halt when a supernatural entity called the Scissorwalker (named for her weapon of choice) begins a killing spree. The game then becomes a fight to survive the horror and be able to leave the ship for safety.\n\nThe cast hoping to leave this ship include Monica Flores (a student who is seeking to marry into the wealth), Rooney Simpson (a woman with a dark past, suicidal inclinations - and no links to Jennifer Simpson), Professor Leonard Cosgrove (whose choice to bring his cultural anthropology students on this cruise may have been a slightly bad idea), and Jerome Theruiau (a French composer who has a spotty memory). Other people share this struggle, but the game largely centers around these four people. The story is played out over a three-chapter spread which each involves playing a character (Monica 1st, Leonard 2nd, Rooney 3rd) and investigating around. On the plus side, the game utilizes a flow chart which shows progress (good or bad) and indicates whether an action will hurt your chance of survival. The flow chart helps in that it makes clear the needed actions and shows what you have and haven't done yet and what you need for completing the game overall. The style of storytelling also makes the best of the character's screen time and helps sell the characters. While some of Rooney's screen time could be shuffled about to the others (her Chapter 3 is bigger than Leonard's 2 and substantially bigger than Monica's 1), this is more a nitpick than legit criticism.\n\nOn the downside, the story of the game has a tendency to become really quite vague. Most of the time the game keeps a subtle storytelling method similar to Clock Tower's, where you have to fill in the gaps yourself, but there are times where the story becomes so vague as to be a problem. Without going into spoiler territory, I will say not too much is explained about the Scissorwalker's origins, among others. For the game's flaws, this isn't the biggest, but it's there.\n\nBetween the art and the audio, the game trades strengths and weaknesses. The official art is good and I do admit the locales have some nice design. The characters are done decently enough, but the problem is that the characters have a tendency to fall head-first into the uncanny valley at times, such as when the animations fail (one occurrence being any scene involving the character talking, and the animation glitches so that they're talking without moving their lips...nice trick). As for the audio (which concerned me a bit since one of the composers - longtime Castlevania composer Michiru Yamane - is doing double time on successful Kickstarters thanks to Bloodstained and I didn't want the game's music rushed as a result), the music, to my relief, is nicely done. Despite the original Clock Tower games being more about silent build than musical, the change of style here is welcome since the soundtrack works very well in setting up the horror. The voice acting is also good, with one exception: while most characters have the right kind of voices, Rooney's English voice, while not technically bad, feels like the voice of a different character. It doesn't match up that well. Once again, however, the uncanny valley models and the one vocal misstep aren't the biggest issues the game has.\n\nFinally, there's the gameplay. NightCry is interaction-heavy (being a point-and-click) and the core gameplay is separated into two parts: exploration and escape. Before getting into it, I'll say quickly that this return to form for Kono is functional and actually quite enjoyable, since most of it flows very well with some exceptions (see below). The bulk of the story lies in the exploration, where you search the locations for items, clues, or just to look around. Places you can look are indicated by the cursor turning into a ring. However, some locations end up being trigger points for the Scissorwalker, which flips the game into escape, but more on that later. During the course of the game, the characters have (or in one case, find) cell phones. The phones function as a flashlight (so as to find more search points in the dark), as a hub into Snap-n-Post, a fictional social media network, and as the save function if you use them on chargers which are placed throughout the game. The most important part of the exploration is that the game requires you to examine everything, because the difference between a good ending and a bad one can be as small as not posting something on the Snap-n-Post or not examining a book. Fortunately, the flow chart provides tips for fixing any problems you encountered.\n\nSo, that said, when the Scissorwalker (or anything else dangerous) does show up - and there are times where this is totally unavoidable - you enter into escape mode. Now, the examination points change in favor of things you can use to incapacitate the threat. Some are red herrings, and some work on occasion. While, obviously, the most important thing is to escape unscathed, fully completing the game does require you to deliberately get yourself killed in these ways. Surviving these encounters should be easy to do...\n\n...but unfortunately, here's where the game's big problem comes in.\n\nThe controls in this game, as I said before, are of the point-and-click variety. The controls work well in an open area or, if you have some experience, in straight hallways, but in areas with small openings or tiny aisles (like a catwalk stairway in a later section), unless you hit just the right point (which isn't indicated), walking or running becomes a hassle, and if you're in escape mode, this can result in seeing a lot of dead ends. What doesn't help is that the camera, at times, has a habit of going where it isn't supposed to. In one instance, I was confronted by the Scissorwalker on top of a set of stairs, and instead of showing the upcoming horror, the camera decided the back of the stairs were more interesting. Thanks for the Gory Discretion Shot, game, I really needed that! The game may be going for the "bad" that Clock Tower went for (the idea that you were a person totally unsuited for this and had to use your wits), but there are times where the game just feels like it crosses the line from aesthetically bad to just bad.\n\nHowever, this may not be too much of a problem in the end. The makers of the game are regular with fixing issues and after my playthrough, some additions, like a phone tutorial and some glitch fixes, were added to the game. I still suffer from the Gory Discretion Shot, but it revolves the camera back faster so I know what I'm doing. Even with the previous issues, the resolution thanks to the developers helped the game a lot, and as a result, I feel comfortable saying that the game is now flawed, but charming. I hope to get all of the content soon (one solid run at 12 hours can get you the best ending and a good bit of progress towards 100%), and with the fixes, I won't have too many more issues I hope.","April 30","true","12.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Yet I ignored that, telling myself that the slightly strange models and physics was just because of early footage.\n\nBut to address the elephant in the room, this game does not look too appealing graphically and even with low settings there is a massive trouble with lagging back and forth. Sometimes I have the game run smoothly and in the next second I can barley move anywhere without the game looking like it is about to crash on me. The models are passable but the hair physics looks really weird and strange, even on higher settings.\n\nIn a game like this, with the promise of the gorgeous looking scissorwalker, your biggest enemy is not going to be this frightening beast. It is going to be the camera. While this sort of camera can work in a game that allows you to move by button pushes it does not implement itself in a good way in a game where you click to get anywhere. The camera loves to get stuck and not change until the last second which sometimes lands you in a situation that means an insta death. More than once I have been killed in this game, not through my own stupidity but because I had to walk into a certain frame but walking into said frame meant walking into the line of sight of enemies, ending up with me dead without even being able to see the threat.\n\nI brought the game along with the soundtrack and while some of the tracks are nice and atmospheric I really can't say it was worth the money. Buy it if you're a big fan but don't expect something that blows your mind away. I also got sucked into buying the artbook and quite frankly, I'll confess it was the biggest waste of money as most of these illustrations were posted before the game was released, completely for free, by the original artists, online.\n\nNow lets get to the story. It's... messy to put it simply. While I can truly see what was trying to claw its way to the surface it was drowned in the constant flip between characters and the game felt so short that I was left just sitting there and staring at the screen once I saw the ending. The middle portion, chapter 2, comes completely out of left field and then it is gone as soon as it came. Besides spewing a little exposition it does not serve any purpose what so ever. If the game had been divided between the actors of chapter 1 and chapter 3 and perhaps expanded, we could have had a stronger game truly. A game can certainly be short and still good but Nightcry tries to cram too much story into a too short span and ends up rushing things and more or less forgetting about other points.\n\nLastly I will address the characters. I can not say I cared for them. While I thought I was going to play most of the game as the main girl in chapter 1 and see some development in her attitude she was instead thrown to the side for two other characters and it felt like any development she did was rushed and just strange. The protagonist of chapter 2 is in my humble opinion a big waste. A character that was not needed and that you don't really learn anything about and then seemingly begones as quick as they came. And lastly, despite the game trying its damned best to make me be overly protective of the last main character I found them to be near to unbearable. They fell into the box of the creators giving me a thousand reason to sympathise with them but they didn't truly act or do anything that deserved my sympathy of the bat and more came along as a melodramatic bleak blob.\n\nIt hurts my heart to down vote this game. When you see so many people with various talents come together perhaps you set the bar to high for what they can deliver. Nightcry needs polish, tons of polish and it would have needed a longer run or a better story structure. Even if you are a fan of clock tower, I can't say it is worth the struggle with the game mechanics.","May 8","false","3.3"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

The Lighting and Music are easily the best elements of this game and set up the mood of the areas and scenes to match a sense of horror, dread, and suspense perfectly.\n\nEverything else however, seems to be hit or miss for me.\n\nThe Animation would be the first example. Because while there are some well animated scenes in the game, at others times i find it to be lacking. There are moments where the characters will be in a ackward stiff looking pose and appear lifeless or move in some unnatural looking ways that lack a feeling of weight and balance. And in addition to that, is when you hear a character speak, sometimes you'll see their mouths move, and other times you wont. Also, the same can be said about facial expressions. Sometimes its animated, other times its non existent.\n\nAnd to touch on another part about the visuals, there are some areas with glaringly bad texture seams in the game. Most notibly on the Island.\n\nApart from that are the Text Sequences, which i feel scrolls too fast. Whether you're a fast reader or not shouldnt matter.. I just feel it'd be better if the game were to let the player scroll through and end text sequences on their own terms rather than letting the game dictate that for you.\n\nAnd lastly are the Controls. Which I dont have too much issues with. Just some unresponsiveness at times. But other than that, the control scheme is ok.\n\nPlease dont think I am being nitpicky. Its just that these are things that are easily noticable to me whenever I play any game and it tends to break my immersion. For other people however, they may not notice as much nor have a problem with it.\n\n\n\n\nThe Devs at Nude Maker definitley know what they're doing. However, there are areas of the game that lacks polish in which I feel it is in much need of so far. With that said though, I still like this game and hope for it to succeed so that some of the issues I have with it will not affect future projects from these Devs.","March 29","true","9.1"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","16","30","0","0"

Unfortunately, Nightcry falls abysmally short of these, but certainly not because vision is lacking; to the contrary, its interesting mechanics, numerous chilling scenes of weird horror, and fascinating narrative style should, in an ideal world, add up to a recipe for success.  The tragedy of it is that this collection of quality elements never really gelled, never quite made it past the "proof of concept" stage.\n\nNightcry does not feel anywhere near complete, having obviously suffered from a dearth of noncreative (but vital) resources like time, money and programming expertise.  This shows in the frustratingly tiny hotspots, bucking bronco framerate, non-moving mouths, partial voice acting and in various irritating bugs (like the camera getting jammed behind a wall, or the disappearance of an essential hotspot at the end of the game).  Most egregiously, it shows in the fragmentary telling of what is clearly a gripping tale of supernatural terror with a rich mythos, one that will probably never see the full expression it deserves, but remain entombed within some Japanese guy's laptop until it is forgotten.\n\nThis game is not worth $24.  It is worth $5 or less, and only for those adventure fanatics willing to suffer through a sadly messy game for a tantalizing, but ultimately unsatisfying, taste of neoclassical survival horror.\n\n(I think all the disappointment could have been averted if Nude Maker had taken thorough stock of its resources and had decided to make a 2D horror game,  like the original SNES Clock Tower, instead.)","June 3","false","10.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","4"

It suffers from all the trappings of a terrible game, such as generic environments, two dimensional and generic characters, horrendous voice acting, blocky graphics and muddy textures, and glitchy controls designed for a touch screen because why the hell not? All of this is doubly offensive because allegedly this game was directed by Hifumi Kono, the man that brought us the retro masterpiece of survival horror known as Clock Tower.\n\nNightCry, or Project Scissors as it is also known, was developed to be the spiritual successor to Clock Tower. It isn't. It isn't even the spiritual successor to Clock Tower's bowel movement; it's the spiritual successor to the remains of Clock Tower's miscarried fetus that was fed to rabid dogs and then regurgitated... and even then that's an insult to vomit.\n\nCase in point: in the original Clock Tower, the killer is first introduced to the player in one of two ways; he either springs up from a bath tub that's situated directly below the mutilated remains of the protagonist's friend, or he comes crashing through a sun roof with one of the protagonist's friends impaled on his scissors. It's epic, it's memorable, and it establishes that this guy is both sadistic and badass even though he's not even 5 feet tall. How is the killer introduced in NightCry, you ask? Some guy that sounds like Shaggy from Scooby Doo gets sucked into a vending machine and then the killer just floats up through the floor. I ♥♥♥♥ you not. I can't make this up. What does that tell us about the killer, that he works for the Pepsi company and he's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that you chose to buy Coke?\n\nNightCry is garbage. Don't play it.  Ever.  All this game does is provide an excellent argument that Hifumi Kono is a hack.\n\nP.S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198191577855/recommended/427660/","76561198191577855","Rogue Kyne","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198191577855/","6 products in account","After playing around 12 hours of the game, getting all but two endings (got the best ending), and seeing a majority of the content, I'd say I'm ready to give my opinion of this game.\n\nI came into this wanting a new Clock Tower game. Not in the likes of some odd magical girl fantasy or weird fetish horror like Haunting Ground/Demento. No, I wanted to relive the experience I had being chased and tormented by a sinister creature wielding a giant pair of scissors. And this game delivers in that aspect.\n\nIn the first chapter, I was taken right back to when I played the original games as a kid. Too nervous to look around, afraid any noise would attract the Scissorwalker's attention, and went through things quickly just to avoid encountering that thing. (Ended up getting a bad ending as a result. lol)\n\nAdmittedly, the fear diminished a bit when I soon learned in the third chapter the Scissorwalker more utilizes the formula of the First Fear. That being, she only appears in certain areas upon examining things as the way Bobby (first Scissorman) worked.\n\nEven so, don't think you can just avoid her. Unlike being able to go all of First Fear without ever encountering Bobby (other than the beginning and until the end of the game anyway), there are certain areas and items you will be required to investigate that can bring her to you. While it is slightly disappointing the Scissorwalker is more scripted, it does encourage exploration, and daring you to take chances. I can say that even though I felt a little at ease knowing the Scissorwalker doesn't show up at random, I did still get nervous and a little freaked in some places, and especially when I did need to escape her.\n\nThe Clock Tower series never really had any great stories. Using a basic plot just to get the horror show going. You're a young girl who under unfortunate circumstances ended up in the clutches of the Scissorman and now must survive and escape. NightCry is a continuation of this basic premise.\n\nThe three main characters you get are two college girls, Monica Flores and Rooney Simpson, and their Professor, Leonard Cosgrove, who were boarding a cruise liner called the "Oceanus". You start as Monica, whose goal is to hopefully meet a rich man and fall in love (don't get the wrong idea, there's more to it than what you may think), then switches over to Leonard who is a cultural anthropologist and a very eccentric man, and finally the melancholic and withdrawn outcast Rooney. All three have their own chapters and offer different point of views of going about this nightmare, all helping to tie things together in the last act.\n\nThe lack of ambience is a little bit of a turn-off for some, and I guess I understand why. But in my opinion, the music more than makes up for it. The soundtrack is gorgeous, delivering a creepy, tension-heightening sound that makes you not want to see what could be around the corner. It's some of the best horror music I've heard since the Silent Hill series, some of my favorite tracks being "Close Behind", "Voyager", "The Cave", "The Cult", and many others. The only thing that disappointed me about the OST was the Scissorwalker's theme. It starts out with a scare chord, but then goes kind of mellow and slow. Maybe it's nostalgia talking, but I always enjoyed the fast paced theme of the Scissorman, "Don't Cry Jennifer". Nonetheless, the OST as a whole still does its job of creating a great atmosphere.\n\nSome of the deaths and gore may be considered over-the-top, but that's always been how the Clock Tower series rolled. I, for one, loved them to pieces. They can get comical to creative to disturbing. One scene in particular comes to mind where something awful happens to a very unfortunate character that was really messed up. But it certainly added to the horror of what these people involved with the Scissorwalker are up to.\n\nNow, having said all of this, the game isn't perfect. In fact, it suffers a lot of flaws that I can see many turning their nose up at it for.\n\n*The graphics. They're not that bad to me, however, I know people of today love their pretty graphics and when you compare NightCry to the appearance of say Until Dawn, it certainly looks ugly. Not helped that it tends to shift. There're times they look passable, to uncanny valley.\n\n*The animations. I will say, this is one of the more disappointing aspects. The animations sometimes are done well enough, but other times so sloppy I wonder how it was deemed "ready". Sometimes the lips don't even move, and while I got over it, I can't blame anyone who finds it jarring.\n\n*The voice acting. Now, in my opinion about 90% of the voice acting was fine by me. Monica, Leonard and Jerome all got decent voices, but Rooney's was the big let-down. She sometimes overacts, and sometimes barely acts, making Rooney's important scenes rather cheesy. Fortunately, there is an option to switch it to the Japanese track if you can't bear the English track. I will say though, I wasn't fond of all the Jp voices either, personally. (But at least Rooney got a better portrayal.)\n\n*The story. I mentioned earlier that the Clock Tower series's stories were nothing to write home about, and NightCry isn't doing much else either. The basic premise is all right (murder on board a ship, try to survive it, you are winner), but it's kind of not fleshed out. It seems to prefer to be a little too vague. There are some largely unexplained parts of the plot that may require you to do some extra investigating and theorizing after. Now, I just came off the game, so a replay may be in order to piece it together. But for now, I got to mark against it that it almost feels "incomplete" at times.\n\n*Jank, camera, and controls. This game is quite unpolished. It uses the old-style point and click that the older Clock Tower games did. For me, I was quickly able to adapt and understand the controls, but I know this won't be the case for everyone else. The camera angles can be a bit awkward as well, causing you to struggle between it and getting the hang of the controls, especially when the Scissorwalker is chasing you. Like I said, I was able to adapt after a bit, but I realize this may be a turn-off for others. And there were times I did fumble with it as well.\n\n*Bugs and glitches. As many people have reported, this game has a lot of bugs. Fortunately, none that really broke the game. Often closing and reopening the game fixed the problem, but it does tend to take away from the experience. The most jarring examples being that sometimes the music and/or sound effects cut out. However, the development team, from what I understand, is hard at work to patch all this up. So hopefully this will remedy the problem. It's barely two weeks old, so it kinda comes with the territory.\n\nDespite naming these flaws and, admittedly, I wish this game could have been more than what it is, I still loved it for what it set out to do. This game worked on a small budget, only just barely above 300 grand, and was lucky to get what it got, so I wasn't expecting too much, but I did enjoy what they were able to do. I don't see a lot of people being very understanding of this though, so this game definitely falls under the "either love it or hate it" category. NightCry was definitely made for Clock Tower fans of the first two original. Following the same dynamics and principles. If the first two games didn't appeal to you, or old school Japanese horror (we're talking PSX/PS2-era) isn't your cup of tea, then there's a chance you might not be able to appreciate it.\n\nIf nothing else, wait for the patches and at least give it a try. Maybe it just might surprise you.\n\nSpeaking for myself as a Clock Tower fan, I was overall pleased with NightCry and feel it is a worthy successor to the original titles. I didn't regret my time at all with this game, and I hope that it improves to be even better in the near future.\n\nOverall score: 7.6/10.","April 8","true","20.6"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","2"

I love point and click but it is tricky on a 3D map with fixed cameras.\n\n2. Kinda buggy. Not game breaking but enough to get irritating.\n\n3. When you get an ending, it is sometimes unclear if you missed something just before it or if you missed something a whole chapter back.\n\n4. No random encounters. All chase sequences are scripted.\n\n5. Quite short when you know what to do. Maybe a 3 hour game.  But hey, Clock Tower was shorter! lol\n\n6. Huge plot holes.\n\nOverall I recommend this game but perhaps wait for the price to drop. It is refreshing to see a return to a classic style of horror that relies less on combat and jumpscares and more on environment and a constant feeling of dread!","April 6","true","16.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

I think it stays true to those older games while adding some welcome features that make it a feel a bit more modern.\n\nThere's some issues of course. The camera is not always as covenient as I would like during the chase sequences and the voice acting is pretty bad, (this actually doesn't bother me but some people might find it a problem) but I really think they knocked it out of the park when it came to making a spiritual successor to Clock Tower. They totally delivered and I really hope that they continue to make these sorts of games.\n\nThis is probably the first Kickstarter I have felt truly proud to have backed. I put money towards it and it was exactly what I wanted.

If you´re a person who likes graphs certainly you will not like the graphs. It needs some optimaztion tho, if you play it at any quality thats not excellent one, you will pretty much see some pixelatted shadows.\n\n- Tho, the only stuff that bothered me is that sometimes the characters do not move their lips when talking in some cutscenes, I tried to ignore it but this is something that I couldn´t forgive. Also, in some mutted conversations they move their  lips, kind weird.\n\n-The story is fine.\n\n-The puzzles are sometimes "ok", however I got totally angry or frustrated (especially at the start of the chapter 2) when you can clearly pass that puzzle (or area) easily enough but you need your character to inspect the ground so he can find out the way out while me (the player) already had the solution for it and let´s be sincere that even the character had it by the looks.\n\n- The Scissorwalker is not scary at all, but she is good to keep the player at bay and have its attention on the screen as she can easily catch up to you.\n\n- There´s nothing that annoyed me on this game than that save flow chart. It has some pros and cons, however, it´s frustrating as hell when you notice you get a bad ending in the middle of the game and realises that you need to roll back another scene of the past chapter plus the entire chapter you get stucked again just so you can go for the original ending. Not only that but upon getting a bad ending in any of the chapters (you will know it when looking at it on the flowchart), the game treats it like a normal game over, leaving the player with a Big WTF on his head.\n\n- You control 3 characters (each one for each chapter).\n- Monica is the usual [censored] person, tho, but she´s fine. She also has good stamina and runs well with that shoes of hers.\n\n- Leonard is that guy who is a genius and a professor (and old too), however, I find it weird that he does not run or reacts or do something when he gets cornered by four masked guys and does nothing but argue with them when they slowly walk towards him. You may argue with me saying that it´s 4x1 and that Leonard is an old person, but still, he could at least try to run or do something that's not stand still and watch.\n\n- How do I marry Rooney? where do I meet her? I want her to be my deathwish diva. (Ok, let´s stop it). For more that I like Rooney, there's something on her a bit off. She´s a introverted person, and serious to a fault (she always excuses for anything) however, her face shows her as a nervous person, not only that but when in muted conversations, her body language shows that she screams over the person she talks to (this happens 100% of the time, and no, she doesn´t say sorry for that), not only it´s a bit off her personality but the other characters seem to not react from her spontaneous reactions and take it as normal since in RL, if a person chats with me and acts like Rooney, I´d totally ask her to stay calm. Introverted person generally is calm and only react spontaneous toward people who knows them, also, according to the game, Ronney is the person who would be considered emo.\n\n- The game conclusion is good  and fine, in the end you will get that mission accomplished feel.","April 8","true","13.9"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

First and\nforemost why I still can´t recommend this game:\n\n-It´s unpolished in a lot of ways.\n-Neither the endings nor the death scenes are that great. (I got all endings, don´t care for the last 5 deaths I still need..)\n-Only the third Chapter is good, that means half of the game is very annoying and boring\n- Branch System that could have been WAAAY better. There are good points, but it´s so boring to go trough all the possibilities. I go further into detail later.\n- You still have to click 3 to 5 times on a person/ object to get the absolutely important Items/ Information for the true end.\n- If you skip all cutscenes and know what to do, then the game is finished in about 1 hour.\n\n| I can only recommend this game to people who are very forgiving to games and don´t get frustrated very fast.! |\n\n-> I gave up this game about 3 times, until I hit Chapter 3, then it actually made a lot of fun. But why is that? Let´s sum it up:\n\nchapter 1: VERY annoying, you do die a lot, but it´s actually never your fault. But this Chapter has the best atmosphere from them all.\n\nChapter 2: the most boring part of the game. No atmosphere, no horror, very stupid quick time events (I only got further because I looked it up on yt and i recommend this method to everyone who needs more than 10 minutes and still can´t get further).\n\nNow why Chapter 3 is the best part of the game:\n- A lot of Characters. Only Rooney has some kind of a story, but it´s still nice to see more (side) chars.\n- A lot of puzzles. To be honest, they were too easy for me, but It´s still a lot more fun than being killed in a badly presented Cutscene.\n- The Story comes togehter. After not understand anything, the third chapter binds everything togehter very nicely. I might say that the Story presentation is a lot better than the acutal story. I think it might have been a very interesting way to always switch between the characters, after some decisions, instead of Ch1, Ch2, Ch3.\n- I didn´t die nearly as often as in Chapter 1 and 2, because the scissorman doesn´t appear randomly and chases you until you´re dead and there are a lot more useable hideouts. So there was like 0 frustration compared to Ch1 and 2.\n- The true ending could be called a "Corpse Party" (yes, i played and liked that PSP game^^)\n\n\nNow about the Branch System\nI like it a lot. Instead of the 0815 "Choose a or b", you have to find Items, post stuff, search for clues etc. It feels a lot more natural than the branch systems from western RPGs (for example). BUT, my problem with this is:\n- There is absolutely no reason to experiment. The Story CAN NOT be changed. It doesn´t matter in which Branch you are, the decisions, the way, the outcome, EVERYTHING will stay the same. So theoretically, if you made one branch, you did them all with the same decisions. There is SADLY no point in experimenting. I replayed Ch3 so often, just to see the same endings over and over again. It was such an extreme waste of time, just so I could find out the first ending, that i didn´t got in Ch1... The developers could make it so that if you clear one branch, it´s cleared on all 3 Branches, it would be a lot cleaner that way.\n\nAll in all the game is half good, half boring and annoying. Who can deal with that, can buy this game, after seeing some trailers (just make sure what you are going to buy). It saddens me to see that aside from the graphics there has been made no changes from the first trailers. If I compare the first trailer from hyper light drifter to what I got in the game... Can´t argue whether that´s a good thing or not though.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNow for whoever want´s to read my old review (4 hours in, only in Ch2). Maybe you will understand my frustration better, because I went more into detail there.\n\nThe true horror\n\nWhere do I even start? Oh, yes, how about the beginning! The first thing that you can do when you start the game is chosing the graphics, the resolution, which screen and windowed. Of course the graphics option has 4 levels: poor, fast, good, beautiful. The game doesn´t look "good" on any of them and you can´t change anything (like AA, Shadows- or texture level etc.). In the game you can only change the volume and language (dual audio: eng, jap). This is already the first fail. The game is locked at 30fps. The second problem was that the game was running on my onboard graphicchip, instead of my graphiccard, so i was playing with 7fps. I had to change it, so that the game runs with my graphiccard myself...\n\nIn the game the true horror starts. I am not talking about the genre,  but about everything else. I can´t choose what the worst part of this game is: animations, camera angles at exploration and escaping, the controls, the HORRIBLE level design or the mechanics. Everything is far from good. It feels kinda like something between an alpha and beta. Only very few cutscenes have audio and the characters repeat their animations every 3 seconds, while talking with closed mouths. There are also a LOT of bugs with the cutscenes, the camera and the mechanics. Examples: The scissorman can be stuck at a wall. Cutscenes being skipped just for fun. You can´t move, because your smartphone light is on. You can´t move because of the camera angle. The camera angle is so rtd that the characters always runs in the wrong direction. etc.\n\nAbout the game itself:\nAt first I thought: Yes! Now it´s getting intense, but soon after that I was annoyed as hell. The game explains absolutely nothing, aside from running away and Items (you can skip cutscenes by pressing space and pause by pressing P). The scissorman can appear randomly, hideouts can be used only once, after that he will automatically kill you, if you use it a second time. The death scenes are extremly unpolished, bad and boring. You will die a lot, because the game is stupid. No, seriously. How the hell am I supposed to know whether I have to go in a room with my ligt on. How the hell am I supposed to know whether he is going to find me at the hideout or not. How the hell am I supposed to know what to do when there is a red exclamation mark? It could simply mean that there is danger nearby or a quicktime sequence is about to happen, OR LITERALLY ANYHTING! How the hell am I going to escape the scissorman, if I already used all hideouts? How the hell I am supposed to know when he appears? He can appear out of lockers or fridges, so the exploration part is completely rtd. The game rewards you with the scissorman if you want to look up everything. There is simply WAAAY too much trial and error within the gameplay.\n\nWhat else is there to say? Oh yes, the characters run like complete idiots, you have no stamina bar, so you never know when you´re exhausted or fall to the ground.\nEven if you know exactly what to do, the game won´t let you do it, because you haven´t clicked like 3 times on an object.\nThe pain you will suffer while playing this unfinished, broken, boring, annoying and bad game can´t be described with words.\n\nTHERE IS NO SAVING! I had to redo the first chapter about 10 times to get all 3 branches to the second chapter. So it took me about 4 hours to get further and now I completely lost my motivation for this game, there is also no hope left, it´s absolutely bad, unpolished and annoying af.\n\nThe game is a HUGE pia, the only two good things I can mention are:\nCamera angles at cutscenes: they are sometimes okay, sometimes good and even sometimes very good.\nThe option to play with english or japanese voices.\n\nSound and Music are ok.\nThat´s it.","March 30","false","18.4"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","11","27","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197985130438/recommended/427660/","76561197985130438","FEAR","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197985130438/","49 products in account","So 15 or so hours has given me more time to think about how I really look at this game.\n\nPros: It's very reminiscent of the original clocktower games, evasion/hiding spots, cursor controls, intense chase scenes. I really liked that and it felt really cool to see this concept in modern day. And while the point-and-click controls were a little wonky at times, it wasn't too bad.\n\nCons: Other reviews have gone into detail about the bugs and such so I won't go into it. Although at one point in-game you open up  the upper floor to a balcony which has a hiding spot, but if you are being chased, the character won't go up the stairs as if it's still closed off. Meaning if you get chased more than once in that chapter, you're screwed.\n\nNext, I feel that the "did you do this?" system is very flawed. While previous clock tower games (Clock Tower 2 had this issue too) had item/action requirements that affected the outcome of the game, it wasn't this heavy handed. Having me die in some ridiculous fashion every 8 minutes because I didn't do some vague action becomes tiring and immersion breaking. There needs to be a period of non-consequential gameplay so I don't have to worry if turnng not a handle 3 times just got me a instant bad ending. (Just a made-up example, not a spoiler.)\n\nAnd lastly, the game fails to explain very important features. Mainly the save system/and continue system. Phone chargers are explained as able to "charge the in-game phones battery" and nothing more, so I didn't think about it as anything else. And for the continue system, I didn't know the game checkpoints at certain segments so all I was left to go off of was a new chapter button showing up on the save data pathways.\n\nThis translated to at one point in the game me repeating half of chapter 2 and the beginning of chapter 3 multiple times because the game didn't display a new button for chapter 3. It doesn't until you complete the first section of that chapter. And with an initial chase that can easily lead you to a dead end and die for lack of stamina, it came to multiple retries until I found out through the discussion board about saving and continuing.\n\nSo, in the end, do I recommend this game? It does capture a concept I loved very much from the clocktower games and I love how intense and high-stake the chase segments are. The scisssorwalker character is so well done design wise and is very intimidating. It is effective in pulling me in. I recommend this game for it's on-point concepts but without proper directions about basic elements in the game implemented, I don't know if I should entirely.","March 29","true","21.7"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"
