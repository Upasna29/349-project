Even by today's standards it is a very enjoyable grand-strategy title and features some of the best diplomacy in the genre. Sending a spy to infilitrate an opposing faction and watching him seize their lands for you, only to find out he has claimed the lands for himself and has usurped you, is just a taste of the possibilities the campaign gives you. Highly recommended and I would love to see features from this game introduced and evolved in future TW titles.","August 16, 2015","true","145.0"," 99 of 106 people (93%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","93","99","106","9","0"

If you like the total war series or crusader kings and are looking for a fine mixture of managing and actually controlling armies and empires this is the right game for you.\nPros:\n-It offers 3 (dark , middle and late medieval age) periods and a huge map (Extended map of europe) letting you play as almost all nations that were present at that time.\n-New factions can emerge when certain provinces are captured (uniting england , ireland and such)\n-It offers a interesting kingdom power system that encourages you to act with honor. Breaking agreements and treaties will result in a loss of reputation, leading to civil unrest.\n-Royal families, their offspring and marriages can be managed as well as knights you can employ in different positions such as generals , spies , priests and merchants.\n-Battles can be fought automatically or you can take direct control yourself\n-Still has working multiplayer support due to direct connections via lan or tcp/ip\n-Game can be quite difficult if you want it to be but the learning curve isnt so bad. It didnt take me long in order to do well and build a small empire.\n\nCons:\n-The units are a bit hard to get into formation when directly leading your battles and it has some minor flaws. Its not bad but dont expect it to live up to total war battles.\n-The steam version is not updated to patch 1.05 , its 1.03 instead so manual patching is required.\n-Widescreens and windows 8 arent properly supported but there are some people that have been able to get it to work. I do recommend to check the forums on that.","June 16, 2015","true","7.0"," 68 of 71 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","68","71","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GenC/recommended/25830/","GenC","General Chaøs™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GenC/","630 products in account","This game is a gem. Its like very lite version of Crusader Kings &  Europa in real time. It has a lite amount of diplomacy,has trading,you can have vassels,be a vassel,make non agression pacts,peace treaties,alliances,declare war, pilage/plunder,start crusades with your pope,join in crusades,and a few more religious items. The default A.I. is pretty decent but I have found often their castle might not be as heavily fortified as one would make.This could be due to battle and such though. If you want a much tougher one,there are mods but I find the default AI fun enough to play with.Auto defend/attack is present be you defending a town,your castle, or when battlefields. This game has probably one of the best auto attack/defend mechanics I have seen I usually just let it auto do it.Just remember there are factors at play via your units that will determine the end result of the battle.\n\nMultiple ways to try to be the most powerful and win the game via getting voted by 2/3 of the top 5 kindgoms. Fail to win the votes and the top 5 kingdoms will declare war on you. Interface is clean,hotkeys for quick menu access,and map icons access menus.Game has autosave which you can enable.The game has online multiplayer restricted to battlefield battles.\n\nThe game has a lot going for it with a little of column A ,B and C in it. I hghly recommend playing it with the Dusk of Glory mod  which works with the default patch steam installs with. Its not a casual game but at the same time can be enjoyed as if it is one.You can play for 10-30min and get a good deal of enjoyment out of the game.Its a game that id like to see a sequel for.\n\nCheck Community Hub for each of these mods I recommend  :\nDusk of Glory  - Game v1.03  (default steam intalled version) I love this mod and currently use it\nElderly mod[spz.uw.hu]   - Game v1.05 only. Information about mod[forum.paradoxplaza.com]\nWorld Domination Scenario mod & Upcoming Amerika Mod  -Game V1.05)\n\nAs far as the  GameV1.05 info[forums.blackseastudios.com] goes from what I read, V1.03 patches the game well enough for most and is bug free.However V1.05 does add additional changes making the A.I. tougher and more capable during battles,but it also introduces a few minor bugs. V1.05 also introduces a map editor.You can dl it here or anywhere just google search.\n\nOr visit the studios Mod section[forums.blackseastudios.com]  . Many of the mods the links do not work,but the 4 I mentioned above are more than enough.They are not compatible with one another sadly.\n\nQuick Technical Stuffs\n\nIt works in Vista and Windows 7 (32/64bit) even though not stated on store page and unworking demo.\n\nIt only supports 1024x768 (but you can play in windowed mode).For some the image won't look stretched at all in full screen. If your widescreen stretches 4:3 resolutions badly, you may want to go into your nVidia or ATI control panel and have your video card pre-scale it before it gets to your monitor so it will display correctly\n\nFar More Technical Info written by CMay,click this sentence.","September 18, 2013","true","51.8"," 58 of 60 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","58","60","0","4"

It was originally released in Belgium 2004 by Sunflowers and then by Paradox for North America in 2005. Developed by Black Sea Studios, (now Crytek Black Sea) they did a fantastic job on this game. However, there are some things I don't like about it, and it's merely personal preference.\n\nDespite KoH being a great RTS, it does tend to get a little boring and repetitive after awhile. The developers could have done some extra things to spice it up more, such as more historical units, random events like disease, fires, barbarian/mongol invasion, the plague, a royal family tree, etc. I find it a little odd that knights live forever unless killed in battle or by a spy, and your Kings only die of old age or in battle or by a spy. Didn't the developers know people died of disease and other things in those days, just like we do in today's world? I'm not trying to flame, not at all, the game is great, but a little more realism would have made KoH the best RTS ever.\n\nAll in all, and despite my personal thoughts, KOH is a great game that everyone should try.","March 22, 2015","true","48.9"," 52 of 55 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","52","55","3","1"

Its core gameplay was easy for me to understand with 25 minutes, and I had mastered many of the simple tasks by the end of an hour, allowing me to start bigger and better parts of the game.  The game is laid out similar to Total war, where you control a country during a time of war and unrest (In this case, during the medieval ages). The game is largely map based, and while it has RTS type battles, I recommend leaving it to the AI auto battle system, as that is a lot less frustrating and tedious.  The games highlights for me are based around its well balanced uses of espionage, religion, economy, military and diplomacy. Any of these may be used to achieve total victory, or a unique combination of them. This allows the player to choose their play style, unlike Total war, where you are trapped in a looping cycle of battle.  Like all games, KoH has its share of problems, and a few of them are major. On some machines, the highest available resolution is 800 X 600, which looks very odd on modern monitors. Un-skippable start up logos that last around 1 minute each time is annoying and makes launching the game a pain. Actual in game issues are few in the area of glitches, but some sections of the game are cruelly tedious, like rebellion and currency inflation. While it may be open for debate if these ruin the game, it definitely adds another dimension to the gameplay.  While KoH may not be on the same level of polish as other map – based strategy games, it should not be forgotten, especially for the bargain price of $9.99.","June 27, 2013","true","92.6"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","1"

There are buildings you can build which won't have ANY USE WHATSOEVER because your nation isn't able to build specific units related to the building.  For example a plate armourer builds his shop in your city.  He builds magnificent armor - but all the people just walk by... they can't figure out what to do with the stuff.  So you just wasted resources to build a building that has no use for your kingdom, but would have use if you happened to be the next country over.  That's a bit silly and annoying - those buildings should be greyed out if they can never be used.\n\nStill the gameplay is very compelling, not for the sake of the graphics, but for the learning curve and immediate challenge with some difficult economics.  The building interdependencies remind me of Eador a lot.\n\nThe various technology trees:  Building interdependencies, Ruler designations, Resources and trade, Advantages (bonuses to groups of resources acquired), maybe 1 or 2 more as I'm just getting started.\n\nOh yeah... "when are they going to have some babies?"  In that way this is a "be the pestering mother-in-law simulator".\n\nI play most of the tactical battles in auto-resolve, which is still a slow animation that is interesting and fun to watch, but my guess is the tactical battles will eventually become a requirement at higher difficulties.\n\nThe pope keeps issuing annoying crusades calls, which if you refuse other nations relations will deteriorate, but if you take, you'll lose a marshall at least for the duration of the crusade, or permanently if you generate a vassal nation from the crusade conquering.\n\nLastly the voice acting is not bad overall, and pretty good in many places.\n\n10/10 I have already got more than my $1.99 and probably easily more than the regular price.

Certain factions in the game get special unit types which can be very intriguing for some people, including myself.\n\nOne small problem I have with the game is, combat. Combat can be very difficult due to the fact that it doesn't work in the same way that usual strategy games do; its more based on numbers advantage or your generals skills, which is from leveling up. However, if you don't like combat or your just bad you can just automate combat.\n\nWell worth the money.\n\nHope you enjoy!","January 3","true","92.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Unique concept with heroes as clerics/generals/merchants (and so on) is great, and it's really hard later on (in a friendly manner), when you have a great kingdom but still only 8 heroes to control and wars on 2/3 fronts. It's something different from others main strategy games, and it's worth a while of your time. If you like strategy games like Stronghold and CiV or EU buy it!

Got myself a solid economy fueling my army.. Swept accross the British Isles while fighting rebels back home. Trained some spys with books, and a couple of my Marshels were themselves spies. I tourtured them and lost respect of the other nations.. Sent my main Marshel on a crusade, upon completion of crusade he choose to take the land for his own. Swept over Spain into Africa and as far east as Russia, destroyed the Papacy by accident when my son and the daughter of the "pope" claimed the land after he died. Sent my last spy on a mission, while gone my throne was infiltrated and all of my near maxed out marshels claimed lands of mine as theirs and rebeled... Still had 3 proviences left and a few marshels... My treasury which was 1k gold a cycle, dropped to -700ish, I was near 100k.. Quickley my marshels which remained loyal were trying to reclaim the lands I had "liberated".. My new marhels were left with basic units and many died in service or imprissoned. I found a few mercany camps and exploited the best units I could find and alloted them to my prince, who immediately became king,. Only to throw all his feudal knights against basic spear men in the african campaign. My spy became king losing vast random tracks of lands to other claims. Finally I regained most of my lands.. Game froze.. Had not saved in 6 hours.\n\nThis is a really good game for its time, and despite some of the clunky controls a solid experience with all its merits still.

It is almost ten years old now, but is still a competent game in its genre.\n\nPros:\nNice mix of kingdom management and military strategy. Provinces can be taken over, developed and defended when needed. Military units can be moved with marshals through the map in real-time. Leveling and perks are deep enough. Fights can be simulated or played on one of the many pre-built battlefields. Sieges and engagements need strategic decisions. Diplomacy is important, every move influences the way how others will act. The whole map of Europe can be seized and dominated. Many nations can be controlled in three different period. The world feels living due to the many events occurring constantly. Pre-rendered graphics look decent even in 2014 and the menus are also usable.\n\nCons:\nOnly two game modes available, campaign and battle. Multiplayer campaign would add to value. Some features are too simplistic and leave some more to be desired, like the importance and use of trade and exotic goods. The limitation of knights/nobles available for actions are frustrating, especially when a bigger kingdom is governed. The way military units transported and used in slots and their numbers feel less appropriate at cases. Also, units moving on the battlefield can collide with each other causing well set formations to break. AI sometimes prefer annoying and dumb decisions both in diplomacy, map movement and battles and can be exploited at times. Graphics engine lacks options demanded nowadays, like higher resolutions and widescreen.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a complex military strategy game with many ways and choices available. The game features long campaigns with dozens of played hours and also has a high replay value.\n\nMy Opinion:\nOVERALL: 8/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nSound: 7/10\nReplay Value: 9/10","October 21, 2014","true","34.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It is similar to a total war game in that you have a large areal view of the map and have cities to build in and upgrade and you can rucruit armies. The game has poorish graphics but it probably won't bother you. In the game you have provences with one city in each, and the cities have limitied build space and some randomized natural resorces. You can't fit every building in the cities and some buildings require the recsorces to be present in th provence to build them. You also hire agents to trade, lead armies. convert, spy, or increase build speed. You are limeted in the nember of these agents. The ones that lead armies gain experiance when they win battles and they can be upgraded when they level up. You can also go on the battlefeild to control units from an areal view, not its best feature so I just let the ai do the battles and try to outnumber the enemy or have a upgraded army with good units in it.

The mechanisms are more transparent compared to that series, and the game feels more limited, less open-ended. This can be both a good and a bad thing, depending on your preferences.\nTrade plays a relatively important role, because you have to have access to trade goods in order to gain kingdom advantages, and you probably can't produce all of these trade goods yourself unless you conquer a lot of territories.\nMilitary and combat are straightforward. Waging extensive wars is complicated by two factors: one, you can only have a limited number of armies at any time; and two, rebels regularly appear in recently conquered territories, so you have to garrison some of your armies in the new territories for a rather long time to defeat the rebels.\nThe limit on the number of armies is due to a clever idea that I don't remember having seen in any other similar strategy game: You have a set number of slots to which nobles from your kingdom can be assigned, and you also assign a specific role to each noble. One such role is the general (marshal), which is important because every army must be led by one. Second, a noble can be assigned the trader role; traders are sent to other kingdoms either to earn money or to gain access to goods that you don't produce yourself. Third, there is the cleric who can convert your provinces to your state religion. And fourth, a noble can serve as a spy either to intercept other spies sent by foreign powers or to be sent to other powers by you in order to gather information and carry out covert attacks.\nHaving played through one game, it is obvious that Knights of Honor is far too easy on default settings. I played as the kingdom of Hungary and was able to conquer the whole eastern half of Europe and part of Anatolia during the rule of my first 6 kings or so (which seems the only way to measure time in this game, since the current calendar year is not shown anywhere as far as I can tell). Given the fact that Hungary was at best an intermediate regional power during this time span and most definitely did not have the resources to carry out such conquests, it is safe to say that you can forget about Knights of Honor if you want to play something that resembles a historical simulation. (For example, when I tried to pull the same stunt in EU III, I was duly wiped out by the Turkish.)\nThe winning conditions are a point that is more problematic than historical accuracy (which is not really that important for a game). One way to win the game is to collect all of the kingdom advantages. This is easy to achieve, you basically have to have access to 5 sea ports and money, both of which are easy to come by. The second way is to be elected the emperor of Europe, for which it is necessary to have the support of the five most powerful kingdoms. This seems rather difficult to achieve. Being the most powerful kingdom yourself is easy, but to get the support of the others you would also have to have perfect relations with them. This wouldn't be that difficult per se either, since everybody else is more than happy to ally themselves with you if you are the most powerful kingdom. However, if you are already allied with one power, this excludes an alliance with powers that are enemies of your ally. So not only is it necessary for you to be on good terms with other kindoms, you should also guarantee that your friends are friends with each other as well. This is quite impossible to achieve given the mechanisms provided by Knights of Honor.\nLogically, diplomacy should be the way to do this, but the diplomacy system in this game is quite useless. You can only ask your allies to attack some other kingdom, but there is no option available to ask (or order) them to make peace with one another and leave each other alone, or else. This, of course, is not surprising but rather seems to be the norm in these games, but it is still a completely stupid omission that basically renders the whole diplomacy system completely useless.\nBeside the fact that the emperor victory condition is unrealistically and artificially difficult to achieve, another major problem with the game is the AI. They don't seem to be interested in the victory conditions. Coastal powers should presumably have it easy to attain the kingdom advantages victory, since all they need for that is ports, but apparently no AI power does that. As for the emperor condition, in the emperor elections no kingdom ever got any votes, which suggests that the AI isn't even trying to win that sort of victory. The AI also tends to do stupid things. For example, tiny, one-territory kingdoms constantly declare war on my kingdom, being by far the most powerful empire in Europe, with the explanation that they need land. It apparently does not occur to them that they should rather try to expand toward their similarly tiny neighbors, which might not destroy them instantly.\nTo sum it up, Knights of Honor is a rather one-sided affair. You either win a trade victory relatively early on, or you try to win the diplomatic victory, which takes unreasonably long, and the computer players do not really represent any serious challenge to this. The only thing they are somewhat good at is the military challenge, which is especially present in the early game. Later on you become so powerful that even this part becomes too easy.\nDespite these serious problems, I'll give Knights of Honor a recommendation since there are good ideas in it, and the early game is relatively good. The fact that the late game becomes very unbalanced is rather annoying, but this is unfortunately the case for lots of strategy games (even otherwise ingenious games like the Civilization series).","April 5","true","31.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

So expanding to neighboring regions and trading with other empires is a must if you wish to be successful early on.\nEach region also has a random generator attached to them. It decides what features it starts with at the beggining of the game, either farm, chapel, village, and docks (I also think it depends if you have certain options checked before starting).\n\n-Knights have differing proffessions: merchant, spy, commander, mason, farmer, etc...(e.g.. Have your only heir become a spy, infiltrate the enemy nation, commands one of their armies, mistake hime for an actual enemy..............\nIt isn't a complex game but it's fun enough to try if your bored with EU4 and the likes.

But you can get use to the art design and the gameplay is actually what I was looking for.\n\nIf you thought "Total War" has been missing the mark recntly with grand strategy as I have, then this game is perfect for you. Sure you're not going to have much in the way of Epic battles but the strategy part is there. Both the campaign map and battles are in Real Time, and there is not time pausing as far as I can tell. The game requires you to think on your feet, busy marching your armies north? well you just missed the enemy swing around and invaded you from the east.\nThis game also simulates one thing "Total War" does not; Campaigning. For instance if you want to take the fight in enemy territory you have to plan, you only get a base 100 food in your cart (Can be upgraded with buildings or leader abilities) if you run low half way to your target you have to plunder a farm to get more which is time comsuming. Also the Longer your on the march the more your men's morale will drop, you'll have to Camp your Armies to keep morale up or plunder villiages wich give you gold.\nThere is no prisoners of war like later "Total War" titles however if you decimate an army without killing it's leader (Member of enemy royal court) you capture him and can ransom him off let him go or execute him.\nThe game also gives your Great historical infomation with 3 playable start times all with a diffrent mix of nations to choose from, and a lengthy introduction to each one.\n\nTo summarize, if your looking for a grand strategy game that is just that, one that you can prepare your armies and plan massive operations, buy this 10 dollar game, you won't regret adding it to your library.","February 14","true","5.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I would say it is a very refreshing game compared to new games coming out.  The game is based upon towns and their provinces. Some are of greater value than others and some are just rare.  This makes for a great strategy themed game.\n\nThe downside of the game. Its a pure vanilla game with no additional add ons or expansions. The game concept is great. It is a shame that no sequals were created or even an expansion. The game is lacking in variety of units. But that said, the game is still very fun.

The game is very much replayable and there's so many starting options I personally have been playing the same path for 9 hours (byzantine, year 1000?,  easy) with that being said.... I rather suck or the game's just that complicated. It's so in depth that it makes you focus on your entire kingdom all at once. 2-3 nations could be attacking you from different corners of your kingdom plus rebels revolting. Definitely the best game if you're looking for long hours of addicting game play and a low price.\n\nCons\nInstructions/tutorial can be a little vague (it's a more learn as you go), in depth fighting is a little rough and hard to control (I personally just let AI do the fighting now), and the game crashes quite often (i'd say about 2-3 times every 2 hours) TURN AUTOSAVE ON, there's an option to autosave every 15 min TURN IT ON.\n\nUpdate on review 3 lhours later....TURN THAT MFING AUTOSAVE ON !!! 3 mins till my next autosave and game crashed. As i said before the game is extremely fast paced, so losing any data is a little disorienting when you have to re-establish where you're at in the game. A huge flaw and consideration before buying this game.... still loving it tho <3","December 21, 2015","true","29.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not fair to the game or my dollar. I bought this on sale for a very small amount and it no achievements so I was okay with it being a loss if thats what it turned out to be. This game was not a loss, it was my addiction for a week. (considering opportunity cost... it may be a loss)\n\nThis game stood out on the market place because of its Age of Empires II graphics coupled with a seemingly total war "esk" strategy dynamic. Upon reading reviews it had a zealous fanbase. (always a good sign) When this game booted up I was suprised to see that this was published by Paradox Games. That was when I knew, that I would be in for a treat.\n\nThis game's most valuable asset is the real time mechanic. Most often I avoid real time stategy like the plague because I like to take my time playing stategy games, however Knights of Honor had a real balanced approach to real time and made it a real fresh experience in my primarily stategy based game library. With a trading system much like Settlers of Catan Knights of Honor frees you to focus on the land grab and military aspects of the game. Plus, this game is not so much do or die, or do and die any way. Most games I play: Crusader Kings II, Dark Souls II, LoL, require very well planned and finesed approach to everything you do. They will stress you out after a while. This game was the first one in some time that I have not needed to instantly consult a guide or index to navigate. The game handles a lot like Sid Meiers Civiliation, its got a relaxed approach that gets only as serious as you want it to be.\n\nAnother gem within this game that must be recognized is the randomization of resources. I cannot tell you how many games are limited by having areas, characters, or strategy that is the best or OP. The randomization frees you from the burden of starter placement. It gives you a reason to expand, instead of being passive. It gives the game all the replay value and ultimately drives the game.\n\nHonestly, this game could be charachterized as Sega's Total War + Settlers of Catan dressed up as Age of Empires II masquerading as Crusader Kings. A very powerful combo.\n\nIf this game had only received a better name and more marketing it would have been a gaming Giant.\n\n","December 6, 2014","true","10.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The developers thought it was a good idea to prevent players from skipping through three different introductions from gaming companies and an intro that is almost three minutes long. This is absolutely unacceptable. To stop this, you are forced to hold down the left Ctrl key while clicking repeatedly the left mouse button (this took some Google searching to discover). What kind of idiotic idea is that? The tutorial is adequate, and the text is accompanied by an ideal voice actor. Voice acting as a whole is excellent. The in-game help system is also very good. There are some issues with crashing from time to time. The user reviewers here were spot on about this game. It is extremely addictive to grow, expand, rule Europe and its surrounding areas. Knights of Honor sucks you in and doesn't want to let you go. The hunger for more power, territory expansion, and blood grows each and every minute. The fun, tension, and excitement increases in strength after every battle, and every province won. You will not notice at all how the hours pass while playing this game. Easily, six our eight hours will expire before you notice. Restroom breaks will also become nonexistent. You will not want to stop! Nothing else will matter! Your eyes will be glued to the monitor! When you are not playing, you will be thinking about strategies to improve your kingdom and to win the game. The game is so good, I even lose sleep thinking about it. I want it all! The entire continent! There is near infinite re-playability, as each of the many kingdoms to choose from will play differently than the next. In addition, each game will also differ from each other, as near limitless alternative history scenarios will evolve and transpire. I would have liked for the game to have the in-game date for perspective. I would have also liked for the player to have access to more than just three religions from the period, with a choice to convert to atheism or at the very least paganism. It would have also been nice if the game included information on what language each kingdom spoke as well. What is also nice is that you can choose to not micromanage the battles. You are allowed to utilize the knights' AI to battle for you. This is one of the most engrossing and absorbing games I have ever played. I admit, that towards the very end, I had grown a bit tired of fighting all the time, but winning the game brought on a natural smile to my face.\n\nKnights of Honor is amazing.","March 20, 2014","true","33.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's a weird mix of Europa Universalis (real time strategy map, faction events such as rebels) and Total War (tactical battles, faction/location unique units and province improvements). And it works wonderfully.\n\nPros:\n\nA quicker yet deeper Total War-like game. The strategic map is real-time, so the game flows better than Total War's turn-based strategic map. It remains manageable because you have a limited set of knights (who can be generals, merchants, priests, etc).\n\nEuropa Universalis-like events, like rebels, nations rising, crusades. It makes the strategic game really fluid, with factions moving across the map, overextending, and collapsing to rebels or nations rising. Even large nations are not immune, so there isn't an invincible, immovable big blob (except for you if you play things right).\n\n\nCons:\n\nThe game is 2D only. While the art style is ok, the low resolution (1024x768) makes playing both the strategy map and tactical battles cumbersome. An HD remake that allows you to zoom out would be awesome. See Majesty HD for reference.\n\nCan get repetitive towards the end of the game once you become dominant.\n\nAI is a easy once you get over the hump at the start of a new game. AI factions don't often concentrate their forces, and builds way too many low quality units. Even worse, AI alliances don't support each other's armies, which leads to them being defeated separately.","October 4, 2015","true","45.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

When I can't see my whole army from a reasonable distance, some mechanic is wrong (or missing) from the game.\n\nOther than that, Knights of Honor is a well-crafted, funnily-narrated, deeply-intricate strategy game.

Alot of unit variety\n\n2. Alot of "factions"/countries\n\n3. Nice blend of combat and managing of country and family/court\n\n4. Loads of different builds for cities/provinces depending on resources and needs\n\n5. Diplomacy seems better than some games where every AI does not immediately declare war\n\nCons-\n1. Combat is really really stale and way too fast, archers are really good for killing own units, tactics vary little.\n\n2. AI constantly recruits peasants but yet said peasants always manage to kill alot of my own better trained ones like spearmen/swordsmen\n\n3. Unit variety does not really help when certain units arent even good at what they are supposed to be for, eg. light cavalry charged head on into 2 tightened formation of spearmen, managed to wipe my spearmen out easily by kiting them.\n\n4. AI really kind of cheats, I burned down his coastal village, imprisoned 2 of his marshalls, sacked and pillaged most outlying villages producing money and yet he manages to dig out 6500 coins each to rescue both marshalls, instantly recruit full stacks of swordsman and come back at me with 3 marshalls when I have yet to even earn 1000 coin to buy a new unit. Supposed his traders were simply floating off or teleporting to the other nations to trade with them\n\n5. Hardware/outdated software issues. Game runs in 1024 x 768 max causing borders and stretching on pretty much current industry standards of widescreens. Scrolling is either too slow, too fast or very "jerking" in a sense probably due to aforementioned stretching. Unable to zoom in/out makes decision making and planning tough.\n\nProbably some other pros/cons slipped off my mind but this should be enough for now.\n\nConclusion: Buy if PC is dated and cannot play any new strategy games/runs in 1024x768 resolution. A good game back then but unfortunately just cannot keep up now.","December 21, 2015","false","1.3"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

Realtime grand strategy game. I love how you can see armies move accross the map. It's not like they are some chess pieces. You can create tactics even outside the battle. You can cross the path of the raiding army and save a town from being captured. Excellent gameplay. There are 5 levels of diplomacy. You can conquer everything not only by force, you have powerful spies, and the power of religion. You need to take care of providing an heir to the throne and the interrelations, or you could pretty much lose everything.\n\nUnfortunately the multiplayer consists of only battles and no conquer all scenario. There is no cooperative. And another sad thing is that the developer Black Sea Studios were bought by Crytek, and are now know as Crytek Black Sea. And there will be no KoH2. I looked into it and the rights for the game now belong to another party, so I don't think that they will release the source either, because this game has potential and should be left for the community to make the game great.\n\nBtw there are some tools that allows customization of the game. Custom maps, custom graphics, custom music and sounds. But it is limited to the number of content that the original game can have.\n\nEven though the game is already pretty old, this is a great game.","September 30, 2014","true","11.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In comparison to Crusader Kings 1/2 and Medieval 2: Total War, it is very arcadey.\n\nYou can take the known world by pure conquest or by subterfuge using spies, or even by demanding another kingdom recognize your right to certain lands due to to a royal marriage.\n\nThat said, there is no family tree history. There is just your current ruler (King, Emperor, Sultan, Caliph, Khan, whatever), his wife (either an "ordinary noblewoman" or a woman they married from another kingdom), and their sons and daughters. Only your sons may inherit, you can choose which one becomes king but this can cause some issues. Your daughters can only be married off for royal marriages/alliances.\n\nThe campaign map is akin to a total war game's campaign map, except in real-time. You can pause or speed up time, however. The battlemap plays out with you actually ordering individual units, and even your marshal (you can not send an army out without a marshal) + his bodyguard, to fight (whether in a field battle or siege). It has the look of a cleaner age of empires 2: the conquerors, in terms of graphics. You may opt to instead let battles auto-resolve (certain marshal traits only apply in auto-resolve). Naval battles are always auto-resolved, and can never be fought manually.\n\nThe A.I. was purportedly developed simply to entertain the player (it was discussed on the old black sea studios forums), rather than actually challenge them, even on Hard difficulty, but this is more or less the case with pretty much any video game in existence that has functional artificial intelligence, anyway. The game has surprised me a few times, like when I had no heirs to inherit the throne, and it turned out the nobleman whom took the throne for himself (a lord I hired to act as a merchant to earn more gold) was actually a spy for another kingdom... And so he dutifully handed the crown over to said kingdom, and suddenly game over.\n\nIt still has great entertainment value, however. And there is even a modding community for it, and once you've mastered the game on the "Hard" difficulty setting, there is a "Hard" modification that makes the A.I. into a totally unrepentant warmonger once you've reached a certain amount of provinces, though they can declare war before that point. Moddb.com has some of these modifications.","March 18, 2013","true","364.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Horrible.\n- no zoom-in/out over the map: difficult to estimate the size of a nearby kingdom, difficult to navigate your own kingdom and cities, difficult to get a sense of what is going on\n- every diplomatic agreement among any other country appears on the notification area, however you receive absolutely *no warning whatsoever* when a kingdom *declares war* on you: if they just immediately on an outpost that has no defensive walls, you are screwed. Now, how does this game qualify as *real time strategy* when it gives you no time to plan and enact a strategy to counter the computer's moves?\n- apparently, the time can not be paused while still being able to interact with the map to get a better understanding of what is going on in the nearby cities.\n- the tutorial goes to great distances to explain trivial stuff like 'click here and there to show this and that' - thank you Captain Obvious, I can learn that myself - but it doesn't spend a single word on the most crucial aspects of the game, that is how stats affect other stats. Basically, you've got to do a lot of trial and error the first dozen of matches before you are able to design a sensible strategy and not waste your gold.\n- at times, armies just sit there doing nothing despite of being given an order repeatedly\n\nPositive aspect\n- The overall idea of the game is great, but the technical implementation of these ideas is horrific and it is not worth a single penny.","December 20, 2015","false","1.5"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","29","4","14","3","0"

Nice unit choices and a variety of building options.  However the buildings are somewhat weak with their effect and really don't do much for the playability of the game other than give unit recruitment and some resources used for the kingdom advantages part of the game.  The "Royal Court" only consists of 9 slots regardless of how many provinces you own and that gets to be a real problem with expanding your kingdom.  Somehow you have to fit marshals, priests, governors, merchants, spies etc, into these 9 slots to manage your expanding kingdom.  That is pretty much impossible.  I usually went with 1 merchant, 7 marshals and left a spot open for whatever else I needed at any given point which makes the whole kingdom court a useless part of the game.  Even with this strategy it was advance a few provinces and then wait and quell the constant uprisings in the newly conquered provinces.  This takes what seems like forever as you have to wait for the "Nostalgia" effect to drop before the rebels stop spawning in the recently acquired areas.\nDiplomacy is unpredictable as nations that you have had good relations with will eventually turn bad for no apparent reason.  Marrying into the noble family of another nation is no guarantee that the nation will have good feelings for you and seems to do nothing but cause problems in the future.  Marrying off a princess is, most of the time, the worst thing you can do.  It doesn't help your standing with the nation your princess is married to and if they claim rights to your lands it goes bad for you either way you decide to handle it.  If you agree, you lose land. If you disagree you lose more than half your kingdom power which effects several aspects of the game to include income, happiness of the populace, and overall standing with other nations. princesses in my kingdoms were all spinsters, never married and an overall waste of the king and queens lustful energy.\nThere are a lot of things I like about this game. Unfortunately there are a lot of other things I find very undesirable.  Now for the reason I gave this game a "NO" in the recommendation.  With all the little things that are either small irritants or just plainly useless in game play the thing that makes no sense is thus.  I played several campaigns and they all ended the same way.  For no apparent reason or some reason that completely escapes me all of my marshals will just quilt and turn against me.  With population at a content level and everything going well they just decide to turn rebel and start destroying anything and everything around them.  When new marshals are recruited to replace and fight the old ones they too turn rebel and continue the onslaught against their former king.  The developers may as well have just added a message that says: "You have played this particular game enough and even though you have done well and managed your kingdom like a pro, YOU LOSE! please play again soon."  I guess that is one way of getting out of writing a good successful end game screenplay.\nIf you do decide to purchase this game I'm sure you will get several hours of enjoyment playing it, just don't expect it to be the greatest game of all time because that one hasn't been written yet.  I do wish this game was better than it is.  It had the potential in development but I think they either ran low on funding or just got sloppy towards the end and rushed it out.  Nevertheless I hope you find this helpful and as I said earlier if you do play this I truly hope you find it enjoyable for the parts that do make it fun and take the rest in stride.  Its not a perfect world after all.  Cheers :)","November 2, 2014","false","151.4"," 20 of 63 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","20","63","0","1"

KoH is an amazing strategy with surprisingly fitting and enjoyable music, which is in the case of medieval games very rare. Voice acting can sometimes get a bit irritating, but mostly its funny, the meta-narrator is even great. Political view! The landscape and the maps are very beautifuly designed, no 3D graphics unreasonable nonsense with no other purpose than to be 3D. I do not know how they achieved it, but every province has a different feel, making every part of the map somewhat unique, breathing history.\nThe mechanics are not that complicated, making KoH an easily learnable game, while it does not degenerate into a boring repetition (to a certain limit). The relative simplicity is then a win, but i would not mind a few more tricks.\nThe biggest letdown is that the multiplayer game supports only patricular tactical battles, not the whole european strategy level. If it did... well, that would most probably be extremely amazing.","November 15, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most people shy away when they cannot get more than 9 knights, but you REALLY dont hardly need that many. Its very easy to overcome the issues you get (too much land not enough marshalls, too many marshalls not enough merchants) Workshop does not work but there are some old mods that make the game better.\n\nThis is the ONLY grand strat ive ever come back to over and over.

I paid $2 for it, and I would have been happy to spend the full $10. This game continues to wow me all the time. The features I thought would excite me are backseated by all the features I had no idea about!\n\nI've expanded my small Kingdom of Denmark through violent and rapid war. I now own all of Norway (this was taken by right of my heir children!) I own all of Sweden (Taken by war because the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ betrayed me!). I own all of what was germany, finland, and I'm expanding south. The main problem I have right now is I'm constantly warring to expand, and my people hate me for it. The loyalists from all the lands continue to rise up and rebel against me and my limited number of marshals are constantly on damage control.
