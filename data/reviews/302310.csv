If you're not into games like Dr. Mario, this game is probably not for you, as that's primarily what the gameplay is in Dungeon of Elements. The gameplay is primarily based around you throwing capsules into a room and trying to match 4 of one color, Puyo Puyo style, to remove all of the enemies in said room. If the smoke from the capsules starts pouring out the door, you're forced to retreat and have to start again. Outside of combat, you can take some of the loot you've found and mix it into a cauldron to produce improved equipment for your character as well as emergency use items that can help bail you out of a tough spot, or you can sell it for money.\n\nThe difficulty for this game scales relatively well, and the three different difficulty levels affect the starting drop speed for the capsules, boss health, and boss attack speed. Higher levels also start to increase the starting drop speed every now and then, and various obstacles placed within the levels impede your capsule movements, sometimes in downright evil places. But you can also use whatever weapon you have on you to kill off enemies in a small area or bring up your shield to temporarily slow the drop speed greatly (however that works) to help you.\n\nOverall, I'd say this is a game worth at least trying out.","June 12, 2014","true","16.2"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","36","42","0","0"

Dr. Mario with combat elements sounds good on paper, especially since Arkanoid did a similar thing to the Breakout formula, but there are several issues with Dungeon of Elements. For example, while there are many normal enemy types, they only differ in terms of appearance and potential loot; they never move, they never interact with the alchemy pills nor the board, and they all die in a single hit. Boss fights likewise tend to simply devolve into tedium as their abilities are usually defensive in nature, such as teleportation, invincibility shields, and/or some form of regeneration; the few bosses which actually pose a threat by creating and moving units are all fairly early in the game.\n\nObstacles on the screen are another element of this game which sounds good on paper, but in execution they are sometimes hard to see and at other times (sometimes deliberately) they hide enemies; this isn't so much a challenge as it is a struggle with the aesthetics. Pits which pills can fall into are another interesting idea, but they are rarely anything but beneficial and this leads to one of the bigger overarching issues at play here; the player is given a ridiculously huge advantage from many of the unique aspects of this game. Weapons have fairly length cooldown times, but can devastate a substantial number of enemies in a single hit, even the earliest boots in the game slow down pill drop speeds substantially and shields temporarily slow it down even more (though I never once needed to use my shield until the very final set of stages when playing on Normal and Hard is only unlocked upon completion of the entire game), and crafted consumables range anywhere from large explosions to a pill which will outright kill every single non-boss enemy on the screen.\n\nThere's plenty of content here for anyone who *really* likes the Dr. Mario formula and there are many interesting mechanics present, but Dungeon of Elements fails to take full advantage of its systems and ultimately comes across as being a case of quantity over quality and simply ends up feeling repetitive.","July 1, 2014","false","6.0"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

You first are put into an RPG character creation screen which was quite odd since this is obviously a casual match-the-colors game, and I cannot even begin to explain how atrocious the character modeling was. Afterwards I was greeted to the “story” presented via a huge book overlayed with what appeared to be Microsofts default Times New Roman font; it was extremely out of place. Finally I began the tutorial and after the first few tool tips nothing happened. That’s right, the game froze during the first 2 minutes of the tutorial level.\n\nNot to be deterred (and against my better judgement) I rebooted the game. It’s apparently an amalgamation of tetris type drop n’ match with completely inexplicable items and rpg elements. The first level- or at least what I presumed to be the first - took no more than 12 seconds to beat and at the same time I apparently killed a boss sans weapon. I moved on to (again I am assuming) the second level and that is where I stayed for a good half an hour. The difficulty was just completely broken.\n\nIn between levels there are art assets that are completely missing, yet have functional tool tips. There is no explanation of anything in the “overworld” and during my time with the game I had it freeze 3 times. In summary, aside from being broken, all the concepts promised in this game are executed much better by other titles. A definite pass on Dungeon of Elements.","November 24, 2014","false","4.4"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","1"

My parents spent alot of time with it, my grandparents also spent alot of time with it when they had the old Nintendo. This game brings back the genre that the newer versions of Dr. Mario butchered and adds the new twist of having an RPG element.\n\nYes, this sounds extremely odd. But I LOVE IT.\n\nPros:\nA well done twist of a nostalgic genre with a modern RPG element twist.\nGraphics are not bad, good by indie developer standards. - Anytime I can crack open an indie game and they put a sufficient amount of detail (Characters blinking, breathing, moving, etc) I know they spent a good deal of time on it.\nAchievements. - Gotta catch em all.\nItems and inventory. - I questioned this at first, but I'm extremely glad it was added and it adds a much needed new element to this genre.\nRuns on old single core machines. - Ye olde Turion 64 processor and 1GB of RAM should work just fine.\nFun and relaxing - Some games are fun and relaxing, some are fun but leave you frazzled. This game is nice after a long day of work. There are no Zombie Nazis screaming in your ear on this game, but it does have some nice tunes.\n\nCons:\nNo free taco with purchase.\n\nWhat I would like to see:\nMultiplayer - The wife wants to punish me. I would like to play this with the parents some day. :)\n\nKudos on a well done game. I hope to see more in the future.\n\nPS. Bought this game on kickstarter.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sitagi/recommended/302310/","sitagi","undercat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sitagi/","940 products in account","Dungeon of Elements is a repetitive Puyo Puyo clone with a few and scarce fun boss battles and a bunch of shallow and incoherent RPG elements thrown into it.\n\nThe core rules of the game are simple: You drop colored pills from the top of the screen onto colored enemies down below, and when you match 4 elements of the same color (not necessarily in one line, as in Dr. Mario), they disappear.\n\nFirst off, the positives.\n\nPuyo Puyo is fun! Bosses in Dungeon Elements are also fun! Each boss is one of their kind, has a set of its own unique abilities (e.g. regain health from nearby pills, spawn hordes of enemies running towards you, shoot a projectile that destroys your pills, etc), and it felt very enjoyable and rewarding to figure out mid-game what those abilities were, understand how to counter them, adjust the play style accordingly and win.\n\nSo, why is this not recommended? Well, because sadly I’ve already pretty much ran out of the nice things to say.\n\nMy main gripe with the game is that it is incredibly padded. For each fun boss there are about 5 near identical and tedious non-boss levels that you just have to… sit through. There is no real sense of challenge in those levels, no new rules, nothing. They are just boring timewasters. You drop pills onto enemies and match colors, that’s it. The enemy and obstacle layouts do change, but that has almost no impact on the gameplay. In my opinion, if the regular stages were made optional, like challenges and side missions, the game would have become instantly better due to the uniqueness of each boss level. It would have been much nicer if all of those levels were turned into optional side missions, leaving only the boss battles obligatory, or reducing the number of non-boss stages in each dungeon to just one.\n\nThe “RPG” elements are incredibly rudimentary and abstract. You have a shield that lets you slow down time once in a while, a sword that destroys N cells once every M seconds, boots that just make blocks fall slightly slower, “pets” that are supposed to automate item pickups, but in reality only mess up combos by randomly picking up strategically important items (which means you do NOT want to have a pet at any time), and you have armor which… serves no purpose whatsoever, aside from being a cosmetic item.\nYou can also craft a number of bombs and use them episodically, but somehow I easily managed to beat the whole game on Normal(the hardest available difficuly that did not require New Game+) without using them even once.\n\nAnother significant issue is the graphics. I’m not talking about the humongous character models that take roughly 50% of the screen for no good reason, those are actually somewhat decent, even though the female body proportions and most outfits suggest an attempt to cash in on the hornier part of the male audience.\nI’m talking about the actual game board, the part which the designers should have put most of their attention into. And it looks they didn’t. The graphics is very misleading, it is hard to tell what’s an obstacle, what’s the background, and what is a hole. Sometimes you can move your pills through what seems to look like pillars or bonfires, and sometimes you get blocked by a rug, or a hole, or some... dust on the floor? Same goes to actual holes through which pills can fall through. Their boundaries are uncertain, and some things that look like holes are in fact plain obstacles.\n\nRotating pills is awkward and unintuitive. Since all pills occupy two in-game cells, one of the two halves must be a pivot around which the other half is rotated. That is a case in DoE, just like it's been the case in Puyo Puyo. In DoE, however, the “pivot" half is not designated in any way, as opposed to Puyo Puyo, where the pivot half is highlighted white and blinking. That subtle thing makes some advanced rotations and combos much harder to pull off, since you always have to remember which side of the pill is its pivot. Rotation animations are also missing, which makes doing precise rotations even more so confusing.\n\nThe story is incredibly dull and feels like a bad book for a young and not very bright child. At one point throughout the campaign you’re supposed to make a moral choice and decide whom of the characters to trust and side with them for the remaining couple of levels, but due to the aforementioned dullness of writing, making the choice just becomes a guesswork. Once the choice is made, you cannot revert it. You have to create a NEW character and start the game from the very beginning to see the other side (pro tip: make a save copy before chapter 8 and when you beat one side, replace the saves and do another... if you manage to care). Aside from the story, there’s quite a lot of flavor text on your equipment and monsters, but most of it is also way too dull to read and care about, and that comes from a person who generally loves flavor texts.\n\nSome achievements are incredibly grindy as well and, according to people on the forums, take more than 100 hours to grind them all out, and quite a bit of luck on top of that.\n\nAll in all, I think the game has its moments, but the sheer amount of meaningless grinding and filler levels you have to sit through to fight the fun bosses prevent it from being a flawed, yet attractive enough to recommend, little indie title. If you want to play Puyo Puyo, go and play Puyo Puyo. If you want a puzzle fighter game, chances are you will be better off with some other games in the genre.","October 23, 2015","false","13.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","12","14","2","0"

It takes some getting used to in order to understand it. I think the problem is that it is tagged as an adventure RPG when in essence it is a puzzle game with some additional elements.\n\nIn order to clear a dungeon, you actual play a puzzle game and it's a lot like Tetris. This is the bulk of the gameplay. This in itself would make it a nice little puzzle game in its own right but Dungeon of Elements takes it much further than that.\n\nNote: I got this in a bundle and paid less than $1 for it.\n\nAs you play through these dungeons you get weapons, armor, money and special essences. You can then do some crafting using these essences to create better weapons & armor. These can then be used within the dungeons to help you clear it more easily.\n\nFor example, crafting a good set of boots slows down time so you can think more easily your strategy, crafting a better weapon allows you to click on enemies to kill them directly, as well as just through the puzzle game.\n\nThis makes it a lot more interesting.

But the truth is that the game actually has quite a bit of content to encourage the player to delve further into the game - mostly, the new recipes for creating new items, which is pretty cool.\nAnd while Easy difficulty lets the player properly play through the game without much hassle, Hard difficulty presents actual challenge that's not easy to beat (I admit Hard was too difficult for me).\n\nThe main issue with the game is that it's repetitive - both in gameplay and in content. Boots and shields will only slow down the falling speed of pieces, weapons can be used to break some pieces, armors are merely cosmetic and pets will fetch items for the player. That's about it. It's pretty fun to try and craft new items but they don't make that much difference in terms of gameplay.\n\nAlso, during gameplay, there's a large portrait of your character there, which serves no purpose except show simple animations when the player activates their shield or when the player's pet fetches an item.\n\nThe character levels up but I'm yet to see that make any difference during the game. I haven't noticed any differences with my character leveling up.\n\nThis game could improve GREATLY by the addition of more, varied content and by making it so leveling up makes a difference somehow, perhaps letting the player add points to attributes that cause an impact on gameplay.\n\nRegardless of these flaws, it's still a fun game.","February 23, 2015","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The backgrounds can be a little confusing, and the controls will sometimes mess you up if you are trying to squeeze something in a quick spot, but otherwise no complaints as far as the game mechanics are concerned.\n\nAside from that you have an interesting take on an RPG/Puzzle game.  You can use different weapons and equipment you find throughout the game, to assist you in clearing the "dungeons" (really just puzzles).   While the replayability is somewhat low, the game does offer an enjoyable means to kill time, and left me wanting to come back for more.\n\nIf you do not know anything about Dr. Mario, the screenshots for the game can better give you an idea of puzzles to expect, otherwise I would absolutely recommend this title for the price to anyone seeking an enjoyable puzzle adventure.\n\n\nPros - Fun gameplay, Awesome design and equipment setup, Soundtrack (medieval and enjoyable)\n\nCons - Dated Graphics, Controls and backgrounds sometimes irritating\n\nOverall - 7.5/10","January 19, 2015","true","4.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dowlphin/recommended/302310/","dowlphin","Dandowlion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dowlphin/","265 products in account","I'd almost have been very positive towards this game. The story elements around the puzzle game give some additional motivation, even if the continuity between story and puzzle segments isn't always there. The puzzle game itself has enough variety to stay interesting. I didn't expect that. (People mentioned Dr. Mario, but this is definitely a sufficiently improved gameplay to not be a mere idea ripoff.)\nWhen I started deliberately aiming for achievements to further motivate me though, several achievements weren't registering for seemingly various reasons, even while others at the same time did register, and that was a bit of a low. I don't know whether it's the game or Steam or both, but come on! Every bit helps in such a relatively simple game. (The screenshots achievement for example doesn't work at all - the counter stays at 0 even between game sessions. Other achievements are annoying, like "play the same level twice in a row". I accidentally realized they didn't mean finish, just start. And the achievement for canceling a popup dialog question doesn't work for all dialogs, only select ones.)\n\nWhen I had played through the easy difficulty and started normal, it began to get a bit tedious with all the recipes to discover and items to sell or use. Not my thing. And some of the achievements are really just for extremely dedicated players.\n\nSo it's a surprisingly motivating puzzle game with a good, slow difficulty progression. The achievement thing doesn't completely spoil it for me, but I wish everything worked flawlessly. Consider this a neutral or slightly positive review.","February 28, 2015","true","11.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's a weak combination of a Dr. Mario-style pill dropping arcade game and a paper-doll "dress up my hero" game, and each element, hur hur, is weak in itself.\n\nReally, I should have said "dress up my heroine," because that's clearly where most of the, er, "visual assets" have been invested.  The male outfits are pretty monotonous.\n\nThe gameplay visuals are so poorly done that half the time you can't tell if something is an environmental obstacle, a bit of non-colliding background decoration, an enemy, or what.  The animation is clunky and makes it very hard to do any kind of delicately timed maneuvers.\n\nThe paper-doll visuals are better but very cartoonish, and this whole aspect of the game feels like a gimmick.  Your RPG-style equipment does almost nothing to alter gameplay; in fact, your armor is 100% just for aesthetics.  The "pets" are derpy, and not in a cute way.  The crafting minigame is more tedious than anything, partly because gathering materials to actually progress through the crafting tree can be pretty grindy... and this is NOT a game that is fun to grind.\n\nThere is actually a story, although you tend to forget about it in between chapters... which should tell you how weak the story is.\n\nI played it for the cards, I played it a bit more to get some recorded video for a video review, and then... that's it.","January 23","false","6.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It was a fun time, really, it was.  I was told i have an extremely high tolerance of pain, because of this.  a few months ago, i ran naked through a leaf cutter ant colony, and then ran to the bushes to lose the baby arm i was holding on top of a fire ant colony (you think sand gets everywhere, oh boy).  Whats my point?  I could not stand the pain and agony of this game long enough to even get all the cards.  Everyone has to have a threshold, right?  This game is it.  The controls are unresponsive, the avatar creation is completely unnecessary, the graphics come right off the playstation 1 era, and if thats not enough, it has a smooth, jazzy soundtrack that makes Kidz Bopz Grammy worthy.\n\nThis is NOT Dr. Mario, or even Dr. Robotniks Bean Machine.  if you have even a single desire, heres a reminder: schedule your colonoscopy, it'll be more fun.","May 25","false","6.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's the kind of thing I can play when I have a fever and other games are too cereberally demanding. Everything negative I have to say is merely an extension of the game hinting at more and me wanting that more to be there.\n\nSo what are these negative things? There's a crafting system but it's largely for show. You can embew items with elemental magic which does different things, but all weapons have the same traits. There's very little strategy involved in it. You can customize an avatar, even giving him or her a backstory or something, but the avatar is entirely eye candy. They watch you play the almost-but-not-quite Dr. Mario game. There are pets, but they only differ in how long it takes them to grab loot for you.

This is not a bad game. It's actually a pretty good for an indie game. I went into this game expecting absolutely nothing but to waste some time as I watched/listened to some Let's Plays, but instead found myself pleasantly surprised at what I found.\n\nThe game play is a clone of Dr. Mario or Puyo Puyo. If you are not a fan of either of those games, you aren't going to like this one - so save your money, close the page and find a different one. No harm done. But if you are a fan of those games, this game goes slightly farther and gives it more than just repetitive game play; you get a small story and extra features to go along with the puzzle game play.\n\nThese 'extras' consist of a alchemy system where you collect items in an attempt to create better items, pets, and a small amount of character customization. Nothing revolutionary, but added enough padding to the game to make it enjoyable enough to continuously grab my interest and keep me playing.\n\nThe alchemy is simple. Mix two items together. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes you're lucky enough to get recipes through gameplay and you can make those items instead.\n\nThe character customization is very simple. You get a small amount of things to customize, but enough that it feels unique. This is an indie game here, of course they aren't going to have Fallout 4 levels of customization, so if you're going in expecting that, expect to be highly disappointed. Of course the graphics aren't the best, but they aren't as bad as many of the negative reviews are making them out to be. I've seen way worst graphics.\n\nPets. Well, it's cool? I can't say much about the pets because I haven't fully explored that function yet. I know they can pick up items but I haven't been using them much. There are quite a few in the game and several of them are kinda cute. Others of them . . . don't necessarily look as good. But indie developer, so I give some leeway for it.\n\nI won't lie, the achievements are very grindy. Am I going to grind to get the achievements? Heck yeah! Will it get to be repetitive and annoying after a while - I fear it may be so. But that is my burden to bear as a person who likes to 100% things.\n\nNow for a few things I didn't like.\n\nMoney. Money is pretty hard to maintain since you need it to pay for using the alchemy pot. So if you're someone like me who refuses to sell anything you pick up in dungeons, then you just get by on the money you find in the said dungeons; which is not a lot. So every time a traveling salesperson comes by, I am unable to buy from him because I do not have enough cash to look at his stock.\n\nWhich leads to another issue. Why is there a cash barrier on the traveling salespersons stock? Wouldn't it be better to be able to see the prices to get a general idea of how much you need so you can acquire that amount? This is one of the things about the game that irks me the most.\n\nSo, for the TL;DR crowd. This game is not as bad as the steam reviews would have you believe. It has some flaws, but on the overall whole, I found it to be enjoyable and entertaining. If you still feel unsure, get the game in a bundle or on sale.","April 13","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
