"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gh0stG3/recommended/482300/","Gh0stG3","Quizzle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gh0stG3/","40 products in account","Gameplay:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOvUIEgI4fE&feature=youtu.be\n\nInvestigator is a Russian atmospheric adventure game set in the year 2050 where the world is being ravaged by extreme weather conditions. The English subtitles are pretty good and aren't hard to understand. There are 10 "levels" in the game. You can choose to start the story in the middle if you so choose, these levels act as "anchored save points" as there are no actual save points in the game. The cinematography in this game is well done at some parts, notably the beginning of some levels and during interactions with certain objects.\n\nThe user plays as Tom, an ex-investigator with a troubled past roaming detailed environments attempting to find a safe haven from danger. The engagements and progression of the adventure are a mix of puzzle and high energy events, mix that in with some JASON(the one with the mask) and you have this game. As you progress through the game Tom's objective and story become clearer.\n\nI should probably mention, there are some horror elements in this game.. Especially if you have fear of spiders or are claustrophobic or have a fear of drowning. A couple of jumpscares too.\n\nThings I dislike about this game are that the puzzles/scavenging are a bit too easy/uninteresting, the game is quite short and the game uses anchored savepoints.\n\nInvestigator runs at 60 fps and isn't a laggy game by any means. It's using the CryEngine so if your graphics card can handle it, it's bootyful.\n\nAll-in-all so far I am having fun with the game and am facing my fear of spiders.","June 1","true","1.8"," 27 of 42 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","27","42","3","0"

You're never in real danger: the enemies are in the cutscenes and can never harm you in the gameplay. The only time I almost felt threaten was when the steam hit my character, but I'm not even sure that did anything but put blood on my screen. Tom (the main character) just walks it off, much like the radiation poisoning. Yeah.\n\nIn the demos, you could find weapons to use. A whole action scene that showed off the combat was scrapped (I remember the area having a shotgun and a little skirmish right after). I'm not saying that the lack of guns means it's no fun; I mean there no variety in the gameplay. (For example, something like using the shotgun to blast open a door, only for the loud noise to attract the weird radiated rock-spiders that, even with a weapon, the player has little chance of winning a confrontation with it. The door, of course, would've been openable by something else, but the shotgun would've provided the easiest way to opening it.)\n\nIt could've been nice to use the environment in any way (outside of picking up boxes and setting them back downâ€”gently) outside of just looking at pretty objects. Everything is bolted to the ground; you can only push, pull, squeeze through and vault up/over things when the game tells you that you can, and once you do, there's no going back for reasons.\n\nAll of the puzzles can be solved in seconds; they're rarely above "door needs key; find the key in other room; open door." There is only ever one path to go on, and the only ever branching path leads to the key/steel pipe/hand wheel/whatever you need to use to open a door.\n\nThis game is going to be perfect for the click bait LP'er crowd; things just happen to our character in loud, blaring noises to only cut to...more hallways to walk into triggers.\n\nThe spiders look ridiculously low poly. Everything in the game is stock assets from CryEngine (even the main character who sometimes has a beard and sometimes not). The camera likes to wiggle around and stick to shots of the stock animals from the original engine when it tries to be "cinematic" or "epic."\n\nThis is a very nice looking but boring game. Pretty much everything in it comes with CryEngine (and you can blatantly tell the custom assets right away).\n\nThe game runs very smoothly.","June 2","false","3.4"," 27 of 44 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","27","44","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/recommended/482300/","genkipro","genkipro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/","2518 products in account","NOTE: This game was given to me by the developer for review purposes. This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Investigator is a first-person horror adventure game set on a post-apocalyptic Earth in 2050, where Mother Nature was the bringer of the apocalypse, with the Earth's climate now fierce and inhospitable.\n\nYou play Tom, a Russian ex-private-investigator, who's been surviving on his own and searching for other people. Seeing signs of habitation while exploring the flooded area in which you find yourself, you tie up your skiff nearby and go in search of the people who must be nearby. Unfortunately what you find isn't quite as friendly as you'd hoped.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - At first glance, the graphics are astoundingly good for a small-team indie game. At second glance, in the starting outside area, the graphics are even better! Trees and plants look fantastic and give a great impression of an overgrown world. Water and rain look terrific, as do reflections, fire, shadows, and the fantastic dynamic lighting.\n\nA significant portion of my praise for the beauty of the graphics has to go towards the CryEngine, of course, which has a tendency to make beautiful looking games. But the tree and character models are excellent and the level design, particularly in that first area, is spot on. Unfortunately there is a bit of inconsistency in the quality while you play and the spiders in particular look very angular and not very detailed, which is a shame. The indoor environments in general are far less impressive than that first outdoor area, but overall the game still looks very good.\n\nThe game features only limited graphics options: resolution, full screen / windowed, and vsync. The included 'Detail Settings' seems to do nothing, at least on my system. In fact, the whole menu system looks like the default CryEngine menu, complete with "CRYENGINE" text at the top of the main menu. It's a bit unprofessional and, together with the very plain and jarringly amateur loading screen, detracts from the overall presentation of the game.\n\nBut that first level, with the great variety of vegetation, birds, rain, puddles ... it looks so good!\n\n\nSound - Sound, too, is pretty top notch: snow crunching, rain, storm sounds, and the other sounds used throughout the game are all perfectly sampled and normalised, and sound great. I can't think of a single one that annoyed me or seemed out of place.\n\nThere's also full voice in the game, in Russian. It sounds great, though since I don't speak Russian I'm not sure if it matches the subtitles displayed whenever Tom or the other characters you encounter speaks\n\nFinally, Investigator includes some hauntingly beautiful original music that suits the atmosphere very well. It's used only sparsely, but that makes it all the more appreciated.\n\n\nGameplay - You control Tom like a character in any FPS, using WASD to move him around, C to crouch, Space to jump, Shift to run, and mouse to look around. Since it's more an adventure horror game than a shooter, though, you don't use the mouse buttons to attack. Instead, the left mouse button interacts with objects in the game world, which always display a large "LBMouse" prompt when nearby to show they are interactive. These interactions usually consist of a small, uninterruptible scripted camera movement to examine the object, and Tom's comments about what you see.\n\nThe game is largely about exploration and discovery in the rather foreboding world. The outside levels do a great job of making the world appear large and open, even though Tom is fairly restricted to only travelling on set paths and to certain areas. The inability to walk off most ledges and walkways breaks the suspension of disbelief a little, but makes the game less frustrating and more fun to play than if the areas were all been truly open, especially since controlling Tom is a bit clunky. He also walks very slowly and jumps somewhat erratically, making the (thankfully brief) platformer-like sections much harder than they should be.\n\nLike most horror games, Investigator includes a healthy serving of jumpscares, but I'm proud to say I didn't even flinch until one got me on Level 4 when I really wasn't expecting it. It's a bit of a cheap trick, but is pretty standard in this sort of game.\n\nThe plot is revealed through a relatively small amount of dialogue and the subtitle translations are a bit rough, with some badly worded sentences and poor grammar in a few places. It's mostly not hard to understand the writing, although there were a few bits of the (short) plot that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me.\n\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ Mostly fantastic graphics, particularly outside\n+ Interesting and atmospheric (hah!) weather-based post-apocalyptic setting\n+ Haunting music and great Russian voiceover\n+ Most convincing overgrown vegetation areas that I've seen in any game\n+ Trading cards\n\n\nCons:\n- Relatively short story that didn't make a whole lot of sense in some places, and didn't take full advantage of the great setting\n- Some menu weirdness ("CRYENGINE" is the menu title, 2x 'invert' settings, 'detail settings' doesn't do anything)\n- Loading screen looks pretty bad, especially when compared with everything else\n- Game doesn't remember video settings between restarts, reverting to windowed mode each time\n- No way to save, just start on different 'levels'\n- Scripted camera movements tend to wobble a lot, presumably simulating head bob, but it's a bit too much sometimes\n- Some poorly worded subtitles\n\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================Investigator is a mixed bag. It has some amazingly good graphics, particularly in the outdoor environments, and it has a really interesting setting with a lot of potential. But the graphics are let down a bit by some of the indoor models and the spiders, and the setting just isn't realised effectively in the short story that Investigator tells.\n\nThat said, I enjoyed playing Investigator, even if it felt like I wasn't doing very much while I did so. I look forward to seeing what the developers make next, especially if it's set in this great world they've created.\n\n7/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","June 6","true","7.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Thats a great price for this game. There are 10 levels, I am currently on level 2 and I have played for just under an hour which includes me exploring everywhere in the area. It has Russian speech, however english subtitles are there and doesnt affect the gameplay at all. Sound quality is fantastic! Especially with headphones as you can all tne detail of the rain etc. Graphics are awesome as well because it is the Cry Engine. Got this game on release date (2nd June 2016) so far no problems with the game. Level 2 is quite spooky so far, and is really interesting and fun. You must try this game.","June 2","true","0.8"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","8","17","3","0"
