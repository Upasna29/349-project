Set aside a couple of hours to learn it, then play it in the dark with headphones. Trust me.\n\nMost people hear that Duskers is a game that forces you to type in commands to play it. It's true, but not universally. You have direct movement control over your robot drones with the arrow keys, but to get them to do anything special you'll need to remember a bunch of commands. And you'll need to keep learning new ones as you explore the universe.\n\nAnyway. There are two discrete stages to know about in Duskers - the preparation, and the execution. The preparation is all menu-based: you choose the next derelict spaceship on the map to raid (trying to use as little fuel as possible when making each jump), convert salvaged scrap metal into useful stuff, and kit out/repair your drones.\n\nThe execution is the meat of the game. Here you remote-control your drones through a derelict spaceship to salvage essential fuel, new drones, new upgrades and scrap metal. You have some control beyond the drones too - you can open and close any door on the ship, provided you have a drone with the right skill parked on a nearby generator. If you manage to find ship upgrades, you can also do things like teleport drones around or power bits of the ship without using a drone.\n\nGameplay video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0H9Hu-oN9U\n\nYou move the drones one at a time and type in commands to get them to use their skills, either alone or all at once. If you tell a drone to do something that takes a while to execute (such as gathering every pick-up in a room), you can leave the drone to it while you go and do something else. If you find yourself using the same complicated command over and over, you can programme it into a simple alias command.\n\nSo why bother automate the drones? Mainly because you don't have all the time in the world. The ship you're boarding will slowly degrade, forcing you to make the most of every second. There will be threats trapped in rooms that may eventually break out. You may even come up with clever strategies for dealing with those threats that require several drones to work together at once.\n\nYou start with precious little equipment - three droids with (fairly) random skills. To be able to deal with every room of some derelicts, you will need to find new skills to upgrade the droids. So if you're unlucky enough not to start with (say) the interface skill, you won't be able to remote-activate the derelict's weapon system to kill baddies. This randomness does mean some games will be less fair than others, especially near the start. But this is a roguelike, so tough.\n\nThere are so many emergent things that come out of the way this game is set up, I can't begin to scratch the surface. It really rewards improvisation using the tools you have earned. And it fully immerses you in the experience - from the eerie, quiet background sfx to the way the control system promotes the idea that you're sat on a ship in front of clapped-out, low-tech equipment remote-controlling drones by the seat of your pants in a dangerous universe.\n\nBe patient with Duskers - it'll take a while to get into, but it's worth every gritty second.","August 20, 2015","true","13.7"," 101 of 106 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","101","106","4","0"

It's tense, original and compelling.  And yet, the more I played, the more the lack of progression and excessive randomness wore away at me, until eventually I gave up frustrated.\n\nDuskers is a sort of "last man in the universe" scenario.  Everything - and apparently everyone - is dead and the player is tasked with figuring out just what the heck happened.  This involves exploring various derelict space ships via a squad of remote-controlled  drones.  It's a sort of SpaceChem meets Aliens as the player controls the drones from an overview while identifying and (hopefully) avoiding dangers.  Each drone has three slots that hold upgrade modules that serve as tools to facilitate safe(?) exploration of the ship.  These range from the subtle and strategic Motion Scanner and Lure, to the more directly useful Stealth and Teleport modules.\n\nWhile controlling the drones directly with the cursor keys is necessary, the player can also type in commands from an overhead view of the entire ship.   The need to type in commands is a neat gimmick and really helps the immersion in the game, but it can also be awkward and aggravating, as a single typo could have devastating consequences.   There's no mouse or gamepad input at all.\n\nA big part of Duskers is its procedural generation.  The derelict ships vary greatly in size and layout, yet all feel basically the same.  Each ship is essentially just a bunch of boxes.  There are no force fields, elevators or teleporters, no human corpses scattered about or locked away in stasis.  It all feels very dry.  I would have thought the setting would allow for some really unique and varied stuff in each ship, but there's only a handful of elements randomly scattered about.\n\nThere are different ship types:  a "military" ship might have more defense turrets, and a "fuel" depot might have more fuel, but these differences are so subtle I eventually stopped paying attention to what type of ship I was visiting.  Worse, the layout of the ships seems completely illogical at times.  You might explore a tiny ship with an airlock in every room, or a massive ship with only one airlock.  A power outlet might power the rooms right next to it, or those rooms might be powered by another outlet at the far side of the map.  I understand this adds to the "puzzle" aspect of the game, as you try to navigate the ship without knowing its layout, but the nonsensical ship designs really hurt my overall immersion.  The risk-vs-reward formula is so random, it's usually better to just explore a few rooms of each ship, then move on.  Exploring a very large ship can be much more dangerous, but probably won't yield more resources than a smaller, safer excursion.  I understand procedural generation is all the rage these days, but Duskers doesn't really benefit from it.  I would have much rather had a large pool of well-designed levels with a clear sense of progression than the infinite number of mediocre levels Duskers seems to be offering up.\n\nThe lack of variety affects the enemy types as well.  I found the first three types of enemies within a couple of hours of starting the game, and then after playing for a dozen or so more hours I found... one more.  There's no clear "late game" or "early game" in Duskers.  You might find the best module for your drones in the very first ship, or you might never find it at all.  Even on the easiest setting, I would often encounter enemies with one-hit-kill attacks right at the start.  Why not have a few, smaller, creepier enemies at the start when the player is just learning, then escalate things to include larger, ship-devouring "boss" enemies later on?  Duskers always felt like it was building up to something great, but that "something great" never seemed to happen.  Most of my time was spent gathering "scrap" (the game's currency), then using that scrap only to maintain the pool of upgrades and drones I already had.   I was hoping I'd eventually unlock the means to craft new upgrades or new types of drones, but that never happened.\n\nDuskers' story plays out through a variety of text logs that are randomly uncovered when visiting the derelict ships.  While intriguing and well-written, I'm not really convinced they provide a satisfactory conclusion to the game's setup.  I never did find all of them, but replaying the game over and over to find the ones I missed didn't seem worthwhile.\n\nThere's a part of me that loves Duskers for its unique style and mechanics, but also a part of me that hates it for being such a missed opportunity.   It's a neat idea, but the lack of variety, progression and the nagging feeling that I had "seen it all" almost right from the start left me ultimately disappointed.","May 19","false","42.7"," 172 of 208 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","172","208","7","6"

You find yourself in a universe devoid of life. How the universe has ended up this way is unclear, your goal is to uncover the universes secrets but to do that, you’ll need to survive.\n\nFrom the screenshots, and even from videos, Duskers doesn’t look like much. You’ve got an overview map of the ship which consists almost entirely of straight lines of a handful of colours and then you’ve got a top-down drone view which offers a closer look but still not much in the way of detail. However, what the developers have achieved with this graphic style is an incredible amount of immersion in the game (especially when coupled with the lack of any music in the game, just sound effects). Speaking of sound effects, they’re also very well done. The sound effects aren’t made to be the noises that you’d hear if you were standing next to the drone, they’re made to sound like they’re what the drones’ sensors pick up and send back to you.\n\nSo, as I mentioned earlier, you have two goals in the game: survive (aka collect resources to keep yourself going) and figure out what the hell is going on in the universe. Both of these objectives require you to explore new ships with your drones. From time to time when you board a ship you’ll find a journal/transmission (which may have been corrupted by varying amounts) which shed some light on what’s happened. The entries don’t have any context so they don’t always make sense but they are pretty interesting to read. Once you’re on-board whichever ship you’ve chosen to explore, you’ll be able to move your drones around the ship and use the modules you’ve equipped them with to help search and collect resources.\n\nThe main resources are fuel (for moving between ships and star systems) and scrap (for repairing modules and drones) but you may be lucky enough to find new modules, drones and even special modules for your ship. There are quite a few different modules (some of which are essential, you’ll always start with them though) which, when used, will allow you to play around with different strategies for exploring the ship. Among the essential modules are Gather (used to gather fuel or scrap) and Generator (used to power a ship generator, giving you access to more of the ship) while some of the modules may start with or find during a run include Stealth (allows you to make your drone invisible for a short time) and Motion (activates a motion sensor in nearby rooms, making it possible to tell if it’s safe to enter said rooms). Each drone can carry any combination of three modules and there’s no limit to what modules can be carried so if you wanted to have all four of your drones carry a Gather module you could, though that wouldn’t be particularly beneficial.\n\nWhen exploring ships you’re allowed to use four drones, though you can have three backup drones on your ship. For the most part, you’ll be commanding your drones during missions using the game’s simple commands (though there are more advanced commands which can be used for greater efficiency). In fact, it’s possible to play the game entirely using these commands though it can be helpful to individually control the drones with the arrow keys in the top-down drone view sometimes. The commands are really easy to get to grips with and there aren’t too many so they aren’t hard to memorise. The command box can also complete the word for you after you’ve typed in a couple of letters, it’s a pretty simple feature but it does speed things up a fair bit.\n\nExploring derelict space ships is dangerous business mind you. One of your main concerns will be general wear and tear. After a few uses your modules will have an increased chance of breaking and this will continue to increase the more you use it. As I said earlier, modules (and drones) can be repaired but that does require a fair bit of scrap (scrap can also be collected by scrapping spare modules or drones). While wear and tear will be costly, it certainly isn’t dangerous. A universe devoid of life doesn’t necessarily mean a universe devoid of things that go bump in the night. You better watch yourself. Finding all of the resources you need can be a struggle but getting out with all your drones in one piece is the real challenge.\n\nThe ships themselves are randomised so they come in a few different shapes and sizes. There are also certain types of ships, such as fuel barges and the different types of ships sometimes offer higher chances of finding certain resources, e.g. you’re more likely to find a fair bit of fuel on a fuel barge than any other ship. The size of a ship can range from three or four rooms all the way up to around twenty. The larger a ship is, the more dangerous it is to explore but the more resources you’re likely to find. You can of course leave a ship without exploring the whole thing though. The problem with the ships in the game is that there are only a few different sized rooms so even if the layout of the ship is vastly different it ends up feeling pretty similar to the last ship. This does mean that Duskers can feel a little repetitive, I found that I lost interest after playing two or three missions, but the game is good enough to keep me coming back for more.\n\nThe other important part of a ship you’re exploring is the positioning/existence of airlocks. Your ship will always dock with a1 (airlock 1) on a ship and sometimes that will be the only airlock that the derelict has, though the usually have more. You can command your ship to reposition to one of the airlocks, this can be useful if most or all of your drones are closer to a different airlock. You can also open airlocks even if they aren’t connected to a ship. This will fill the adjacent room (and any adjacent rooms connected by open doors) with radiation, destroying anything that may be in the room.\n\nJust a few more things to wrap up. Each system has a minimum of three or four derelicts and it seems that the number of derelicts increases the further away you are from your starting system. There isn’t a difficulty setting in a traditional sense but there are a few different options you have to make the game easier or harder, such as how quickly modules degrade. You can save (by quitting) at any time but there’s no way to load earlier saves, if you screw up there’s nothing you can do unless you want to start a new game.\n\nVerdict\nDuskers is an incredibly immersive strategy rogue-like that offers unique, challenging gameplay, though it may be held back by the somewhat repetitive ship layouts. If you’re a big fan of space games, rogue-likes or a combination of the two then you’ll probably be happy with a full price purchase (I certainly am), if you’re not then I’d suggest waiting for a discount.\n\nLone Ranger Reviews.\n\nEl K.","May 27","true","3.8"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","40","43","0","5"

First person games like Mirror's Edge use full-body awareness so you're controlling a body with heft and limbs rather than a disembodied camera. Gone Home, Amnesia, and The Room utilize tactile hands-on gameplay. And then you have games like Her Story and Uplink, where you're not merely controlling a character. You are the character, your computer screen acting as the in-game monitor, a direct window into the game's world.\n\nDuskers fits in that latter category and this tactical sci-fi survival roguelike utterly succeeds at delivering an immersive, atmospheric experience,\n\nThe universe is dead. You are alone. Supplies are dwindling. Welcome to the bleak world of Duskers. As the lone survivor in a galaxy gone silent, you travel from ship to ship, derelict barges and stations and outposts now drifting through space. Fuel and resources diminish with every jump, as you desperately stave off starvation or avoid becoming stranded in the endless abyss.\n\nBut exploring vessels yourself is too dangerous because, while you may be the last human,...you certainly aren't the last organism. Death lurks everywhere, from alien horrors and active security systems to radiation leaks.\n\nSo you use the next best option, From your ship's console, you remotely guide drones through the dark rooms and corridors. You view the world through your ship's monitor and the drones' limited, grainy camera feeds, sensors and cameras that can fail or make errors. They act as your eyes, ears, and hands from the safety of your ship. And you don't guide these drones through icons or RTS-style controls, but by typing in command lines.\n\nWhile it may sound archaic and clunky, the command line interface is part of what makes Duskers so brilliant and immersive. Every command must be planned and carefully considered, because if something goes wrong - and it will - you must adapt and improvise on the fly. It gives the game a deliberate, cautious pace, as you command your fragile drones to maneuver between rooms, use motion detectors, gather supplies, power generators, and so on. When you're hurriedly typing in commands as radiation is spreading through an outpost and power is failing and the creatures you had trapped in a room are breaking free, Duskers is at its most tense, thanks to that careful pacing and detached perspective.\n\nBut Duskers is also a tactical experience. Scavenged gear can be used to modify drones with lures, cloaking, motion detectors, even the rare weapon, but the best tools are the vessels themselves. You can trap aliens in a room then activate a vessel's on-board defense system, or open an airlock to suck a roaming turret into space. Caution and planning ahead are how you keep your drones intact.\n\nDuskers mixes moments of unease and fear of the unknown with satisfying strategy and on-the-fly improvisation. Similar to Her Story or Uplink, the command console interface results in an immersive intimate experience. You are the last human, controlling your drones, from your computer.","August 23, 2015","true","5.1"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","37","39","0","3"

Don't get me wrong: I genuinely _want_ to like Duskers with its fun concept of piloting your vulnerable tools around derelict spacecraft from the relative safety of your control station but it doesn't feel as though there's much reason to go looking for fuel, scrap, (possible) drones to either salvage or steal parts from, or upgrades because the chances of actually finding something useful are slim to nil - More on that in a bit. Ironically, you're required to explore in order to continue surviving so it's a catch 22.\n\nDuskers is, at its core, a roguelike set in space with cool 80s-looking computer graphics which in and of itself is worth a lot in my book because not only does it look neat, it doesn't get boring because it works very well with the concept. The 'drone vision' with its primitive interpretation of the environment through sensors and crappy audio from drone mics are a nice touch. You genuinely feel like you're piloting a small fleet of drones. You can either manually drive the drones around (something you'll find yourself doing a lot) or the game gives you a command interface similar to a Linux/Dos/Windows cmd prompt where you 'program' your drone to move and perform tasks; essentially queueing-up tasks for it. The command interpreter, for lack of better name, is a bit dodgy though which can sometimes result in commands you queue appear to look correct (at least according to the game's limited in-game help) but actually not work correctly, or at all. This can result in not executing at best, unexpected behaviour or worse: catastrophic mistakes being made. You're actually better off manually piloting the drones for the really tricky stuff. I'd like to see the command interpreter be a bit more refined so you're not left second-guessing just prior to hitting Enter and re-reviewing the command sequence for the fifth time.\n\nAnother problem I noticed with Duskers after the initial 'coolness' factor wore off, was much of the gameplay relied on dumb luck, not skill. For example, the tools one would use to determine if going in an adjacent room is a wise idea (motion scanner, sensor, etc.) are not only unreliable but you're not even guaranteed to get any of these useful tools to 'look ahead' which means you'll be sending your vulnerable drones head-long into the unknown - As a player, where are my tools to help me choose if this is a wise idea? You're essentially left guessing. This, in turn, not only exposes the rest of your drones to danger, but is almost a guarantee you'll be one less drone going home and making next mission even more difficult due to missing tools (which are scarce as is).\nShould you lose all of your drones (which can happen in a single mission!!) you're done- Game over. Time to Reset. During a play session of about two hours I reset the game 16 times because of various reasons in which I simply could not continue the game. Either my drones would be trapped in a space station, I would run out of precious fuel (even after jumping because let's face it: The fuel dispensers aren't guaranteed to give you anything) or I would lose all of my drones by sheer dumb luck (bulkheads blowing open and pulling my drones into space, doors not sealing so my helpless drones were either mowed down by some enemy, irradiated or pulled into space). The game does it's best to warn you about these types of events (mostly) but that doesn't mean you can use your skills to avoid it for every situation. The most you can do is try to get out of the craft with your drones or jump to another galaxy in hopes you'll find more fuel to carry on. Also, you're not even guaranteed to find any scrap to keep your drones in moderate working order or repair your ship or their upgrades. The readout of the craft you're going to be boarding has a 'Scrap Capacity' number which, in my experience, has been nowhere near what I've actually recovered from any of the places I've visited. Most of the time I usually find somewhere between zero and five scrap which usually I'd store for after the next mission in hopes I'd be able to repair my drones to a decent health if they made it back. This is assuming they didn't take additional damage.\n\nThe enemy types in Duskers aren't vast but they do serve their purpose. You basically have to try your hardest to slip past them (manual control) whilst giving the more menial tasks to the command queues (keeping fingers crossed you don't have to intervene whilst performing a crucial sneak which hopefully won't result in you being detected). Your options are either avoid, attempt to outrun or go on the offense against them. For two of the three entities these options work but there is a third type that is so damn fast it makes me jump every time my drone is attacked by one. This one appears to 'leap' on your drone, if it's detected (and it usually is), and is an insta-kill. But again you'd not know if this type was in the room until you happened upon it. I've tried killing this type before: Blowing it up with a mine, shooting it with a turret, blowing it out into space by opening an airlock – No joy. They are invulnerable. Worse yet, there can (and have been for me) been multiple of them on 1 ship so you're pretty locked down and may as well just pack up and leave if you can.\n\nDuskers has an interesting back story that I'm really keen on finding more about. The story is pieced together throughout your various plays (hint: You'll restart the game a lot) and the story is cumulative so you've at least got that going for you. As of this writing it wasn't complete but from what I'm gathering it's shaping up to reveal what happened to, well, everyone, as the game developer's promised.\n\nBottom line- Here is some suggestions for the developers:\n* Rougelikes punish the player for dumb choices BUT the player still has control to make these choices. Duskers doesn't give you any of the tools necessary to approach each (or hardly any) situation without blindly guessing if you're going to make the correct move and prosper. Best case is you'll enter an empty room but that's of no value, generally. Success through repetitive play isn't fun if you keep running out of options 'just because'.\n\n* Drones are basically thrown into the jungle without even so much as a butter knife: They need weapons, even cheap ones that don't last long. As a player I would love to be able to get access to at least 1 weapon for one of my drones that will have an effect.\n\n* Enemies need to do more than just sit and wait. Often times I've entered a room and there would be something just sitting there in wait, dead-centre of the room. They might do with a bit of patrolling around the room they're confined to.\n\n* More scrap. Since the drones are mobile punching bags, it would be fair to throw in a decent amount of scrap from time to time to give the player the option to repair. Again, if the player cannot continue because their drones are falling apart and they've not had adequate scrap: How is that their fault? They didn’t choose to not repair.\n\nDuskers is a fun game, but has potential to be something truly unique and great. I look forward to the future updates. I'm going to suggest people save their £15 but should things change in future updates I'd be more than happy to recommend this game.\n","April 1","false","14.0"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","33","39","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/254320/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2002 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nImagine you’re the only human alive in the entire universe and you’re stuck inside a spaceship, how do you survive? You get your hands on little drone fellas and you send them to derelict spaceships in search of resources vital to your survival. Welcome to Duskers.\n\nThe visuals are pretty basic but do an amazing job in conveying information to the player. Still, I’m a huge fan of how the map looks, it reminds me a lot of old sci-fi stuff and it looks like something that came out from the Warhammer 40k universe. Duskers is an excellent example of how graphical fidelity isn’t a necessary condition for a game to be not only immersive but truly wonderful. The premisse of the game is pretty simple, board abandoned spaceships with up to 4 drones and try to get as many resources as you can, preferably without loosing any drones.\n\nYou can visit different systems on the galaxy map, and inside each system you can travel to nearby derelicts and then board them. As you play the game, you’ll be able to equip your drones with different modules which grant them special abilities, and you’ll also be able to upgrade said modules, as well as upgrade your mothership. These modules can be things like motion sensors, for detecting enemies in nearby rooms, or generators, which can power sections of the old ships.\n\nThe thing that really makes Duskers brilliant is its atmosphere and how involved you can get while playing. You control your drones via remote control or by typing commands on your console from your secure, albeit decaying, mothership. This allows for quite some claustrophobic scenes, if you can call it that, because when controlling the drones remotely the camera is really close to the drone. The way I see it, the game becomes more tense and a lot more fun when playing in the schematic view. Here you can see pretty much the entirety of the vessel you’re currently at, and it’s best to use when issuing commands via the console. It is the fact that you’re actually typing those commands on your keyboard that make the game so atmospheric and immersive. It is the perfect way to recreate this scenario, it is as if you were actually this lone survivor struggling to survive, if that makes sense.\n\nAt first I thought it would be somewhat confusing, being able to control the drones both ways at the same time but it is actually not. In order to move throughout the ships you must open doors and sometimes power them with generators carried by your drones. Each door is identified by a code, like d1, d2, d3, and so on. In order to open or close a door you simply type that code in the console. Simple right? The thing is, you have to be careful and slowly scan the ship in order to see if there are any monsters or defenses lurking. If you find a turret, you can disable it by interacting with an interface, which requires a drone equipped for this purpose. In order to get yourself rid of enemies, you can lure them to other rooms and then close the doors behind them, allowing you to explore the room they were originally in, or if you can also open airlocks or activate the ship defense system.\n\nDon’t let the looks deceive you. Duskers its truly an amazing and unique game unlike anything I have ever played. It is tense, tactical, atmospheric, it requires careful planning and thinking, and most important, it is a lot of fun. I’m looking forward to see how this one develops!\n","April 17","true","7.2"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","25","27","0","0"

My crew is missing and had to re-purpose some drones to make repairs.\n\nEverything that could go wrong has, I have limited fuel, limited resources and have had to resort to explore this sector to look for supplies.\n\nThings turned from bad to worse when I realized that every ship and base I have discovered has turned up empty. No life, nobody.  Nothing except some extra scrap and some upgrades I used to further my search.\n\nI'm starting to hear noises now on certain ships that I have been avoiding like the plague.\n\nPlease if you can hear me, i'm low on fuel and I don't know if I can make it out of this star system without help.  I’m encoding my flight plan in this transmission and I have set it to repeat. If you receive it, meet me at the edge of this system and maybe we can find a way out of here, thank you and good luck.\n\n\nAliens Meets Teleglitch\nThis game has a mix of panic when entering a room I shouldn't have with the need to type commands to get my limited team of drones out before they all die makes this a very unique and interesting concept for a game. Its also very rewarding when you get the right combination of upgrades and drones to survive for longer periods of time. Due to the games uniqueness, it has a bit of a learning curve though as not all the information to play the game is readily available and I have had the need to watch a few videos and read many of the help sections that are part of the game.\n\nThe premise is that you are one man on a ship with three drones exploring a galaxy of dead ships and stations trying to find the answers to what happened. Every time you dock, you wonder if this one will be your last, since a single mistake can cost you the loss of your extended arms, ears and eyes.\n\nThis game requires a lot of thinking and planning before you make any moves. If you are a survival buff I think you will like this, if you hate overcoming steep obstacles you might hate it. Before I bought this game I looked at the negative reviews and saw the complaints about it being to hard and knew right away that I would like it. Im a big fan of survival games like Dayz and Arma so it works for me.\n\nAfter watching the developer's twitch streams I realized I also like the developer's attention to detail and his response to the community on making this a good game.\n\n\n\nThe Good:Interesting Concept.\nUnique interface.\nChallenging.\nEngrossing\nEngaging\nSlow Paced and Tactical\nYou will die a lot (if you like that, think if dying as a learning experience)\n\nThe Bad:Some Bugs\nNeeds some polish with understanding the game mechanics\nMore atmosphere and sound cues are needed to invoke the feeling of isolation and dread.\nGame mechanics are a bit hard to understand given the uniqueness of the game.\n\nConclusion\nSome how the topdown approach to this game has a way of not making me feel like my life is on the line.. I think it might have been better to do a 3d approach instead where you are seeing things though the camera in a 3d perspective IMHO. But its not a deal breaker for me.\n\nI'm 12 hours in and maybe this is a slow paced game as much as story goes so I don't know yet if it needs more journal entries to move the story. It would be nice if there was audio logs to add to the atmosphere.  I mean I like the concept of reading them yourself as well. I guess that I am used to hearing audio logs in other games which always seems to add to the horror for me. I think then there should be some more hints or sound cues to hint at what is happening, to improve atmosphere of the game.\n\nI like the game so far it has a lot of replay value as it takes many replays to get the gist of the game. With limited resources, finding the necessary upgrades, and fuel makes it fun and challenging.\n\n8/10. Good work on making a game that stands out.\n\nP.S.\nI launched Fallout 4: Far Harbor on one display but have yet to start playing because  I am reading, writing, and thinking about playing this game instead, and I guess that is a good sign.

I don't know how this fares against other scores, but around this mark, things started going downhill for me very quickly. Most ships I explored by this point were falling apart and contained four enemy types, one of which melts your ♥♥♥♥, coming through the walls without you even noticing that it's there and there is not much you can really do to track or eliminate it (my favourite...). All it takes is for your generator drone to die from one of these stealth attacks and if you haven't got a spare or a remote power upgrade wired in to your ship, the entire mission is quickly borked. All you can really do then is watch your bots slowly sizzle in irradiated rooms, get chewed by bugs or get sucked out of that failed airlock that is suddenly venting everything to space because your genny died and you can't close any doors.\n\nSNAFUs happen all the time. There are times that YOU will be the cause of them. I once typed in the wrong door number by accident and ejected my two most favourite drones out of an airlock. The early stages of the game are fantastic; as you wander around, getting used to the awkward controls that are the text console, and learning about what makes the monsters tick, strategising and working around problems that you face when one of your key drones gets bumped off and you're left to do without some crucial gear.\n\nDepending on who you are, these hardships might make your game more interesting and enjoyable, or, just rage quit. Certainly for me in my first run through, I found the challenges refreshing. The possibility of losing everything without the safety of a 'do-over' was impossible to ignore and forced me to weigh options carefully, bailing when I didn't want to, but as a necessity. I've had a few times where I've had to say, "f**k no" within just a few minutes of a boarding. There is no hand-holding, and I like that.\n\nHOWEVER... I'm now at the point where it's not that compelling to play. The large ships with hundreds of empty tiny rooms that you have to meticulously go through using sensors and lures or whatever you happen to have in lieu of a stealth fitted scout, just becomes a chore (even with a decent scout it gets tiring). Like many reviewers, I've found that the procedural generation and RNG lets the game down in some ways. Ships, stations, whatever, all feel like the same thing. There doesn't feel like there is any difference beyond the various ship/station types and classes apart from size. Outposts offer some new challenges (as you lack the ability to dock), but it's just more of the same. Risks and hazard levels can be the same for everything. So can the rewards. You could go to a big station and find nothing, and conversely find a good haul on a ship with only 6 rooms, which you can easily clear in under 10 minutes.\n\nThe story progression is interesting and compelling. There is no linear way for it to play out, you just collect random text logs from various boarding ventures that the ship computer uses to assemble various theories, from which it then formulates certain objectives you can pursue, with a view to finding new information. It's a compelling mystery that keeps you wanting to find out more, but you have to be patient, because the RNG might grate on you to the point where it becomes an afterthought, and that is not a good thing.\n\nSo there it is. Some negative some positive. Because I enjoyed this so much in my initial playthrough, had fun with the challenges and problem solving, and because I think the concept is fresh and fun, I'm giving it a thumbs up.\n\nI'm not a reviewer, I don't really bother, but I wanted to leave some feedback and a recommendation because I think the dev is on to something, and they deserve some praise for their efforts, which I hope to see gaining some additional features and complexity in the future.","May 24","true","23.4"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","20","20","2","0"

Whether that's the reskinned and retooled horror games we get. Or the sandbox, survival, mmo's that have taken the Steam market place hostage.\n\nA procedurally generated universe in lo-fi computer terminal graphics is your sandbox. An army of computerized drones are at your command. Being the last surviving member of a spaceship, you must wield the tools available to you and search nearby destroyed ships for fuel, parts, and upgrades to survive.\n\nDuskers does a good job of setting you up for success. The Drone tutorial at the beginning does a great job of explaining the basics of the console and most of the common commands you'll be using. The console also does a good job of auto-filling in your commands, which helps if you're in a tight spot and need to quickly go stealth.\n\nThrough the use of the console and the visual tactical view of the vessel you have boarded, your goal is to collect resources by going from room to room and gathering scraps of metal, destroyed drones, and precious fuel cells. Drones you find may have upgrades and parts you can take for your current set of drones or they can be salvageable all together and after a bit of repair can join your ranks.\n\nEach drone is unique and can be upgraded through a modifications page. There you will also maintain repairs, ammo, charges to different abilities (like the motion sensor) and salvage any extra parts you may have. The salvage gives you 'scraps' which are used in this maintenance.\n\nThe gameplay is great with a combination of exploration, puzzle solving, and ingenuity you will clear out the ship of any threats and hopefully gather enough resources to survive another day. The puzzle solving changes with every drone loadout and every ship. Depending on what your drones have equipped changes the approach you can take to navigate around enemies, get to a room to power a generator, and clear the map without any casualties.\n\nYou can manually control each of your drones or using the console give them commands to move to different locations (it actually feels a bit like chess). Upon boarding a ship you first need to take inventory of what you have, if you have the motion sensor use it to check nearby rooms for life before entering. If you don't you may have to think out of the box a little bit. Try using stealth and sneaking into the room to see, if there's an enemy you may need to lure it away to another room and lock it in. Or using the interface upgrade hack into the ship's computers and turn on the defenses and let the ship do the work.\n\nAfter clearing out a ship you must gather all your drones into an airlock and board back onto your ship. Anything left behind is left there, unless you return. From your mothership you have access to other objectives, drone upgrades, and a map. The map shows which Star System you are in and expands from there. From the system to the galaxy and to the universe, there seems to be plenty of broken ♥♥♥ ships out there.\n\nI really didn't find anything about Duskers to complain about, maybe some music? However, that lack of music is rather fitting, you are commanding drones on an empty derelict spaceship, so how much music would there really be.\n\nDeveloper/Publisher 'Misfits Attic' took a step back and went back to the basics. Not in gameplay, but in design. Duskers is the ideal minimalists game on the surface. Much like the MUDs of my childhood, it utilizes a very intuitive and engaging style of gameplay. It's a game that gives you full control and any failure is your own.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/tAPqP-_YQpc\n\nDuskers is available August 20th on Steam.\n\nFor More Reviews and the Bi-Weekly Podcast\nEarly Access Media[www.earlyaccessmedia.com]\nYouTube\nPodcast[www.earlyaccesspodcast.com]","August 20, 2015","true","2.7"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","25","31","0","0"

It's a strategy/management/puzzle game wrapped in a bit of roguelike with a fantastic coat of low-fi sci-fi. Other reviewers have done a far better job explaining the game, and really it's exactly what it says it is. And don't be afraid of the console/command line, it definitely kept me from jumping in immediately. While it may seem a bit gimicky, once you start playing with it you realize how much it adds to the overall ambience of the game, fitting in deftly with the theme. It's so easy to use that you'll find yourself popping off commands easily, and direct control makes you feel the claustrophobia and emptiness of the derelicts you'll be scavenging for supplies and information.\n\nI like new ideas, and I love developers who take long shots. This game has some pretty interesting mechanics, and so far has all the trimmings to become something really special. While the price point might deter some, those who do jump in are in for a treat. Can't say I've ever played anything quite like Duskers, I just hope that Misfits Attic give us enough tools and variety to make it endlessly replayable.

It also gets progressively more challenging and as you upgrade your drones and acquire new modules for them, you get to choose on how you want to progress and complete your levels.\n\nThe main goal of the game is not entirely clear at first, but becomes more obvious after a few playthroughs and since this is a game you can play both casually and with more hardcore mentality as well, I think it will appeal to many kinds of players that don't care much about graphics and would rather focus on a complex and original gameplay design.\n\nLearn more by watching this video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nr78ivth5j8","May 18","true","3.4"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

Simply put, Duskers is the BEST sci-fi rouge-like since FTL.\n\nYou are alone on your ship in the middle of space with little fuel.  The only thing surrounding your ship are ghost ships, silent space stations, perhaps even the occasional automated store.  The only option left to you is to remotely control salvage drones to explore these derelict ships in search of fuel, scrap, ship modules, and other disabled drones to add to your fleet.\n\nTo control your drones you have to type out commands into a console window, or alternatively you can take control of one drone using your arrow keys.  Typing out commands isn't just a gimmick to make the game stand out though, it is a vital tool to learn.  With the command line you can send out multiple orders to drones all at once with ease (once you learn a few more advanced commands that is).\n\nIn order to explore these ships you will need to power the ship's systems with your drones.  This will give you access to controlling various doors and airlocks on the ship, which you will need to use to avoid any xenomorphs as you scour the vessel.  Like most Rogue-likes you are going to die... constantly. But everytime you reset the game you learn more strategies about how to safely collect supplies. If you listen closely you can somtimes hear each unique sound various threats will make when they are on the other side of the room.\n\nAs you explore the galaxy you will also find various text logs on ships and stations that can be put together to find out what happened to humanity.  Your ship's computer will give you various objectives in relation to the logs you find, which you can in turn complete to learn more about what happened to the galaxy.  The logs are very well written. If the gameplay and visuals weren't already engaging me enough, the story surely sucked me in.  The only story in the game is through audio logs, and for me to say that it's a gripping story means the game has some damn good wrtting.\n\nOverall I can safely say that Duskers is a game well worth $20.  To say that the game is light on content is not entirely untrue, but typing out commands in dozens of different ways and learning to code your own commands (yes, you can CODE your own commands) is more than enough to keep you playing.  I love this game and plan to spend much more time on it.\n\ncomplete review1; publish; recommend duskers; return all home; end","May 21","true","33.0"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","0"

You wanted to play a horror game. Perhaps a survival rogue-like one? Forget your run-of-the-mill jump scare games, monsters, aliens and other nasties. Duskers will make you fear mere sounds of the ship you've docked at creaking, shudder at seeing flashing red doors and jump at simple beeps of your console.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game has to be applauded over and over. The graphical nature is simple yet complex. Simple in terms of the console view where you can see the location of your drones, the layout of the ship, the state of its doors and so on. This part is logically clean and very un-Hollywood like, where terminals will be more graphically impressive than any operating system yet look a fraction as useful. The console, coupled with the ambient rumbling of your ship's engines as well as various blips and blops, will reinforce the feeling of isolation. The feeling that you are truly alone in the cold vastness of space, desperately trying to keep your aging ship and failing drones to keep going as you attempt to figure out just what has happened to everyone.\n\nThe complex part of the graphics is the actual drone view of the ships you board. Since you're remotely connecting to your drones, you can only see what your little workers see with their sensors and cameras. This means you have a limited line of sight and a distorted representation of the corridors, terminals and generators you happen to come across. This view is both beautiful, in a way, and terrifying, as the ships' interiors are a jumble of broken pipes, floors and other machinery. Often you might barge into a room you could not probe for motion beforehand, trying to spot an enemy in order to pull out and shut the doors, but you will instead get spooked by an eerie formation of damaged equipment that might, for a moment, make it appear like you have stumbled upon a hostile entity.\n\nThe bad guys, in this case, are an unknown. You will have to progress through the story - the bits and pieces of uncorrupted (or semi corrupt) transmissions and logs of the people that had left the derelicts where they are. Your enemy will be unrelenting, unfeeling and without mercy for your drones. Should your greediness to collect more scrap, drones or upgrades get the better of you (which, with the usual scarcity of the resources it often will) and make a mistake of scouting a room you can not escape for one reason or another, the game (or, rather, the enemies) will punish you greatly. Thinking and planning ahead is always a concern and, often, you will find yourself thinking of the worst case scenario, per-emptively shutting doors and moving the rest of your drones away from the unfortunate scout and gatherer.\n\nLater on, as you scavenge, the game will provide you with various upgrades, systems and scrap to keep your group of drones going, but never will you become complacent, as the ship you are piloting (you can commandeer some ships you clear out as well) will always have limits in terms of maximum scrap (currency) and upgrade slots. With these limits, you are always encouraged to be smart with your spending and take as few risks as possible while scavenging. However, not taking risks is simply not a part of this game.\n\nEvery ship you will dock will be dangerous. There are enemies, defensive turrets you can enable and then mistakenly run into, failing airlock doors which will, after opening for the final time, cause all the air in the exposed rooms to be blown out, including your drones, enemies and goodies. Not only that, if you manage to somehow contain the situation, exposing the rooms to space will flood the rooms with deadly radiation, which will adversely affect your drones to the point of them failing completely.\n\nIn the world of Duskers, danger is always present, risk taking is a necessity, planning is important and feelings of isolation are a constant.\n\nAnd it's a world I absolutely adore.","April 14","true","44.4"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

You sit at a computer in your space ship controlling your drones while they explore derelict space ships, hunting for scrap, fuel and useful tech.\n\nThe game is very old-school and controlled solely via the keyboard. There are two methods of controlling your drones, either by moving them around with the cursor keys, or by issuing commands to them via the terminal. Using the terminal requires you to memorize a handful of commands like 'navigate', 'gather' etc. As with all good terminals, you can just write the first few letters of a command and auto-complete it, speeding up the gameplay a little.\nWhile exploring the rooms and corridors of the dead space ships and stations you often come across hostiles that can damage and destroy your drones. Luckily there are several ways to avoid and/or neutralize them; one way is to just suck them out the nearest airlock. This does however have the unfortunate effect of blowing out everything else that might have been in the room with the hostile. Point being, every action in Duskers has a consequence, and often you have to outweigh the risk with the reward. I've often omitted visiting parts of space ships because I just couldn't risk losing my precious drones.\nI spend a lot of the time while playing just analyzing the situation and trying to find out how best to explore the ship with the means at my disposal. Sometimes the game throws a wrench in my plans like rupturing a pipe in a room, leaking lethal radiation all over it, or perhaps temporarily breaking the video feed on my drones, leaving them blind. The game might seem unforgiving at times, but I actually think this is good, otherwise I could just learn the optimum strategy and use it every time; some randomness and chaos is good. Also, it sends the adrenaline pumping when several alarms suddenly go off and you know you have to jump ship, frantically trying to type the necessary commands to save your drones, but ending up with 'naivgaet 1 r1' instead of 'navigate 1 r1'. Great fun!\n\nThe graphics are rather simple but work very well considering the setting. It actually reminds me of the computers from Alien (the movie), and by extension, Alien Isolation. Pure 70-80's sci-fi goodness!\nThe audio is great, with ominous sounds being heard throughout the ship, bulkheads creaking, computers chattering, and creepy unindentified noises. Sometimes you hear a loud groan and an airlock ruptures somewhere in the ship, setting off beeping alarms and flooding the room with radiation.\n\nThis game really speaks to the nerd in me, as it has 3 elements that I adore: scifi, drones and the terminal. I'm an avid user of the Linux terminal, and this game gives me the same power at my fingertips as the Linux terminal does. I feel like I'm acting more directly with the game through the terminal than if I was using the mouse as in most games. Of course, it does help if you have a good typing keyboard, preferably one that clatters really loudly!\n\nDuskers might certainly not be for everyone, but I think that if you like the aforementioned points, you'll love this game. At this point I've only owned the game for a few days but have already played several hours (which is a lot for me) and still find it as interesting as when I first loaded it up. It's a game I can pick up for 20 minutes or play for 2 hours as I wish, and I can easily see myself playing it for hundreds of hours over the next few years.\n\nI give Duskers a big thumbs up, even at the current 20€ retail price. To me it is absolutely worth the price.","May 17","true","16.3"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

Airlock doors creak open and 3 decaying drones shuffle into the waiting dark, scanning for anything out of the ordinary. A drone heads to a nearby generator and powers up a small portion of the ship. Ancient lights flicker to life and reveal dusty, abandoned rooms to sightless machines. Nearby doors hum with their newfound power, waiting to be opened and to reveal their secrets.\nThe other drones begin searching for something, anything useful. A drop of fuel to make it to the next ship, a chunk of scrap to repair that long suffering drones faulty camera, maybe a destroyed drone full of upgrades or a new addition to the team.\nA door is opened and a drone begins to move into the next room but there's something wrong with the camera feed, the darkness in the other room seems to be moving, pulsing and whirring.\nThat's no fault.\nYou waste no time in jumping into action, this is a threat that has been seen before. Your fingers dance across your keyboard, commanding the door to shut before the horrors from the other room are unleashed. A finger slips and instead of Door 10 slamming shut Door 19 on the other side of the ship slides open. The swarm flings itself into the room and begins to dismantle the nearest drone. Panicking now you order the 2 remaining drones back to the boarding ship, leaving the 3rd to it's fate.

You're playing a chess match of sorts: keep your drones safe by manipulating the environment and being 2 steps ahead of your enemies. If you're looking for something fast paced, Duskers is not the game for you. Don't get me wrong, some of the best moments of the game happen when chaos hits the battlefield: as you're scrambling in panic trying to figure out what to do. But the game wants you to take things slowly and methodically: because one wrong move will get your drones killed. This game will punish you hard for a mistake, and masochists really will love their time with this game. It's just going to take you a while to get up to speed, as the game doesn't do a good job of teaching you its mechanics, and there will be a bit of growing pains. But if you learn the walk, you'll really enjoy what the game has to offer, especially if you want to exercise your brain.\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nThe game is at its best when chaos rules. When you've got asteroids hitting the ship you're investigating or radiation all of a sudden popping up, the panic created is a blast to deal with.\nStrategy takes the center stage, as using your equipment to the best of your abilities. Attempting to outsmart the enemies by opening doors and using the ship's environment is a slow chess match. It's a bunch of fun.\nDespite some repetition, gameplay has an addictive quality to it. Not necessarily to a “one more run” mentality, but I found myself easily starting the next game without any reservations.\nGood difficulty. It's a roguelike: it should punish you, and make you beg for more. Yes, that sounds a little masochistic. I'm a Cubs fan, I like a little pain.\nWhen things go wrong, 99% of the time, it's directly your fault. Even if RNG was the cause, you will still feel like you're the one who screwed up.\nLike the command line interface that can speed up gameplay. The two different views both provide good benefits, and can help speed the game along.\nNegatives:\nThe game doesn't do the greatest job of teaching you its mechanics. A small tutorial sets the stage, but with the different equipment and mechanics here, it needed to go a little further then it did. Yes, you want some self-discovery and self-teaching, but this goes a little too far.\nWhen using the command line navigate function, wish that AI was smart enough to not try to go through elements that would damage them.\nDo wish for some way to mark the map up from a cleared/information perspective. Yes, the map can change and all, but I would love a way to mark a room that a virus/bacteria is in so I'm not surprised when it starts dealing damage.\nSome of the visual effects can hurt the eyes. I get what they are going for in terms of presentation, but some of the effects really hurt the eyes.\nRNG will drive you up the wall at times. It's a roguelike, you should expect that. But even then, you'll curse the Angel of Luck.","May 19","true","12.5"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

Then buy this game. It's exactly as fun as that sounds. (No, really, it's great.)\n\nNo matter how far you get in Duskers, you're always 1 typo away from having to restart, and I love that. The game is "fair" in that if you die, it's generally your own fault, either for mistyping a command, doing something you knew was dangerous and getting unlucky, or some other user error - there's very little RNG at play here (except in map generation), and you have plenty of opportunity to 'NOPE' out if it looks bad before you lose drones.\n\nThe gameplay is very much what it looks like from the videos and screenshots - you're exploring derelicts salvaging equipment and supplies that enable you to live a little longer and explora some more. It's a resource management game - Scrap is the resource used for almost everything - repairing bots, repairing your ship, funding upgrades, creating new modules, etc., and there's two types of fuel needed to get around the universe - everything comes down to how efficiently you can perform to keep those resources high.\n\nThe graphics seem to be a turn-off for a lot of people but they're spot-on for what they should be for a game like this. You're viewing the world through antiquated computer hardware, and it captures that feel perfectly, right down to the 'degauss' command.\n\nOverall, highly recommend this game.

Then I stopped because it was SO GOOD that I wanted to wait and experience the sekret plot stuffs once the game was complete, rather than as they were developed.\n\nBasically in this game you navigate your space ship around a map of star systems containing lots and lots of derelict space ships, using drones to board and explore them. Along the way you need to gather food and fuel, upgrade your drones and spaceship, and try to figure out what caused all the ships to be derelict -- of course you don't want it to happen to you, too.\n\nEach ship you explore is like a mini dungeon in a roguelike, with rooms and passageways and doors and airlocks.\n\nYou can navigate your drones directly/visually, with arrow keys to rotate and move them around. You can also issue text commands to cause them to move or perform various actions. The drones can carry various upgrade modules to perform specialized functions; for example a drone might have a generator used to power the dead ship's systems so you can open doors and whatnot, or a gatling gun for defense. Most of the drone modules are controlled exclusively through text commands.\n\nThe challenge in the game comes from the fact that you don't have direct experience of the ships you are exploring; all you have is the information relayed to you by your drones, which may be incomplete. Hell, it's pretty much always incomplete. So you have to infer the safety level of rooms before you enter them, and use clever manipulation of ship systems and drone upgrades to defeat the threats without direct confrontation, or in an ambush where the odds are stacked in your favor.\n\nIt can be a little challenging at first to get used to the command line interface and learn all the various drone capabilities and how to use them; but the learning curve is quite navigable and it is rewarding to get good at it. You can set up aliases for frequently used commands (or just-in-case commands that are too complicated to type in a hurry when under fire).\n\nIf you do well, you will acquire more drone upgrades, ship upgrades, food, fuel, and information.\n\nIf you do poorly, your drones will be destroyed, your ship will run out of basic resources, and you will have to re-start from scratch in a new randomly generated galaxy -- death is permanent.\n\nIt's not for everyone, but if it sounds good to you, you will probably like it.","May 11","true","24.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

But I will say, there is not anything else out there exactly like it. Which isn't bad in this case. Mostly being that if I had played something similar I would not have been as interested. The game is not something I can replay till the end of time but if the criteria fits your interest then the money is not wasted.\n\nThis game, if anything is more like a simulator for those salvage and recon expeditions you always see in movies, except instead of coming back with a magical discovery 10 scenes later, you manage them real time. At first I will admit I was a bit skeptical, but the feeling you get when watching in dread as each drone one by one be converted into spare sparts by a group of organisms, smashing its way through the interior blast doors of this dead ship you have entered in search of loot, leaves you feeling pretty hopeless.\n\nCombining console commands and a pretty convincing GUI, the game puts you in control of not only these drones, but also the ship itself. You will slam doors as you escape, fire up gun turrets to obliterate the opposition and even sometimes yourself, flush the dirty alien scum through an open airlock you have cleverly lured them into, all while towing a dead drone back to your ship for spare parts and upgrades.\n\nThe feeling of consequence definately makes you want to watch your a**. Any drones that are left on the ship after departure, or disabled and not dragged back to the ship are left behind permanently. Your drones will become like little pet projects in which you spend your salvage parts and switch various upgrades into, in order to further your efforts to rid these adbandoned spacecraft of valuables. Improve speed or refill your trusty supply of motion trackers. Equip those new upgrades or repair that drone you rescued from the last hunt.\n\nNot once did I find myself feeling bored, and I assume as the game progresses and my drones become further equipped and more valuable not to lose, my interest will sustain. The UI is attractive and the game is smart. The console is really cool but I already like anything console based. Pretty neat being able to generate a command to autopilot your drone to another end of the ship to hack a defense interface, while manually pilotting a drone to gather scrap simultaniously. But know what this game is before you buy it. Looking for non stop action? Want that new thrill that can only be achieved by shredding guts and drenching your war torn body in the blood of your enemies?\n\nThis game is not for you.\n\nOtherwise, redock your ship on airlock a3, risk it all, or decide and leave your most precious and currently disabled drone behind instead, and dont forget to seal a few doors as you go.

I am excited to see it expand over the coming months and hopefully become more difficult as well. I am hoping that ships become more complicated and have more parts to them as well! Having airlocks and different types of rooms would increase the difficulty as well as perhaps give us some more fun commands when working through ships. I got to about 200 days before realizing I was not going to be able to jump back to a stargate since the closest stargate was three jumps away. I guess I found the use for the long range scanner finally. I wish there was a way to make jump fuel, even if it was 30 scrap. I would have sold everything down to 1 drone just to have the chance to recover in a new system. Some mild music in the main star map would be nice. The ambiance on the ships from just the sound is fantastic, but it leaves a little wanting when you are looking through star systems and doing drone modifications. It could use a little bit of a change between those two environments from a audio perspective. Adding delays to the command line such that I can have a drone move to a room and do a command such as interface and shipscan in order would be nice. An option for search or explore ont he drones would be nice so that I can explore rooms without leaving the command line. My least favorite part about the game is manually moving drones around the ship. I have much more fun in the command line view itself. When modifications have upgrades they should probably sell for one or two scrap more than a non-upgraded modification. There have been some ships where goo and radiation wrecked my game within 15 seconds of landing and r2 getting destroyed as soon as I typed begin and let my drones out. That was kind of lame, but I do respect that the ship I landed on most of sucked integrity wise. I always go for an upgraded ship surveyor now so that I can just completely avoid these rooms. Goo should maybe show up on the command line map such that my drones don't get completely surrounded by goo just because I was not manually checking the drones every minute. That could go either way though, it does increase the probability of failing a mission, but it feels kind of lame having my game end over something like that.\n\nI was thinking it might be interesting for us to have to clear out our own ship on occassion due to a foreign entity such as swarms boarding the ship. This would give the chance to have an encounter on ships that would look different than the derelict scrounging aspect of the game. Having the ability to research new modifications could be interesting, although I am not sure how that would look. It might be cool to have a flamethrower modification to be able to clear out goo. The only feasible method I have at the moment is opening everything up the the airlock which will allow me to get to the fuel but absolutely wreck everything else.\n\nOverall I am hoping the game play becomes more difficult and varied. I love the difficulty and would love to see it get more complicated and difficult.

The feeling of helplessness when you make a bad decision and have to abandon your favorite drone (I'll come back for you Qbert, I swear). Or when you're stoked on successfully looting a ship by blowing your enemies out an airlock into space. The sense of urgency when the radiation alert sounds due to a failing airlock, leaving you with only a handful of seconds to retreat to safety. Or when the aging hull creeks a little louder than it did the last time... or did it? Do you continue into the next room in search of more sweet, sweet scrap?

It was worth every penny.  The trailer drew me in and I was not disappointed.\nNow there are pros and cons.\n\nPros:\nThe game provides a sense of claustrophobia as you're limited to either your drone's view (which is detailed) or an overview of the entire map (but not as detailed).  You'll switch a lot to be able to see specifically where stuff is and how to position your drones.  And the times when your video cuts off, only adds to the sense of suspense and worry.  You constantly have to scavange derelicts for just enough supplies to keep you going and it's hard to maintain supplies (between repairing and upgrading drones, maintaining their upgrades, getting ammo, and much more)\nDrones have to work together, sometimes swapping parts to adapt to their enviroment. You'll have to constantly be on the alert for random events (an asteroid strike, broken vent leaking radiation, a malfunctioning airlock) and sometimes you'll have to control yourself and not be greedy or stay too long.\nThere are moments where you'll jump in fear, such as checking a room and out of no where an enemy lunges fromt the shadows to attack you drone, killing it and destroying you vid feed so you can't see what happened. When it comes to enemies... well stealth is keep and one mistake (like leaving a door open a second too long or not closing another door) can lead to you losing either one drone or all. Best of all, the game has good replayability due to randomly generated systems, galaxies, ships, and maps.\n\nCons:\nIt can be difficult to deal with typing your commands (especially when dealing with enemies or radiation leaks or even asteroid strikes) and I've had more than once where I typed a wrong key and opened a door which lead to all my drones being killed.  Another is when you start a new game, sometimes you get bad (for lack of better term) starting equipment which makes the game harder.\n\nOverall:\nThere's so much more which I could go into detail but I'll leave it to those. I found this game wonderful and despite frustrating parts, I still pressed on and was rewarded.  If you're into games with puzzles, suspense, resource management and strategy, exploration and stealth, then this is definitely the game for you.","May 21","true","14.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Although my notes are based on the "Future" branch (which is usually closest to the official release content) I am going to review my review so that it more accurately reflects current content, if necessary.\n\nA deeply immersive and bleak roguelike about a wandering omega man and his ragtag band of robo-friends.  You will leapfrog across the known universe, one derelict at a time, and haunt the skeletons of former civilization via remote control and DOS-style command prompts.  Everything you consume--from fuel to tools to repairs--will be scavanged; every piece of information you glean about your hopeless surroundings will be provided through the grainy and deteriorating sonar feeds of drones, threadbare schematics, and corrupted data logs.\n\nAt about the time you're low on fuel, running a skeleton crew of increasingly fickle drones and their increasingly unreliable equipment on dilapidated space stations and ghost ships, you'll realize the theme of Duskers: nothing lasts forever in this universe.\n\nThat being said, the game rarely feels unfair.  You're given the tools to survive as you hop from one wreck to the next, uncovering fuel and scrap to help sustain your growing cast of drones and equipment.  You'll never seem to have enough to stay on top of everything, however, and the way you prioritize your repairs and mantain your roster of robots will influence just how long you might last once the meteor storms, hull breaches, creeping radioactive crud, and consuming swarms arrive.  Maintenance and upgrades are appropriately complex systems that opens up the door for a variety of strategies, and the degree to which neglect can manifest itself in your equipment--from the way a drone might start drifting to one side. a video feed might become corrupted, or a module might begin to fail--means that you will have to cope with the hardships of the things you can't immediately fix.\n\nDuskers is a roguelike that, even in early access, provides a wealth of material and choices in a distinct format that really makes you feel like you're sitting at the controls of a commandeered vessel, picking through wreckage via command prompts.  If you've ever wanted to sit in Bishops seat and reenact the desperate moments of Aliens with cute robots for marines, this is your chance.","February 20","true","19.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BugZyAussieHeroes/recommended/254320/","BugZyAussieHeroes","BugZy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BugZyAussieHeroes/","617 products in account","Product received for free\n\nMisfits Attic, the developers and publishers of Duskers, have kindly given us a key to review their game. Any opinions are strictly my own.\n\nAt first sight, Duskers looks like something that you would scroll past, not thinking twice and, if you did happen to think twice and decide to take a closer look at it, you would most likely think “this looks rubbish, I would never play it and it sure as hell doesn’t look like it’s worth twenty dollars.” Although that is an unfair assumption on what may be a very interesting game, we are all guilty of it. Even your neighbor’s cat. This game is a very good example of the common phrase “don’t judge a book by its cover,” because even though you may think it looks old and boring, it is far from it.\n\nUpon launch you are greeted by a menu that looks like command prompt, or the interface of an extremely old computer. Extremely old. Think dinosaurs, then think before that. That old. The interface is relatively easy to navigate, that is all I can really say. It doesn’t support mouse input, but with all the shortcuts it is very easy to get use to pressing “P” to play. There isn’t much visual detail, but really, you can’t add detail to something that isn’t meant to be detailed.\n\nThe next thing you will be greeted by is the map screen, and I would like to point out that after several hours of playing, the game is huge. It took me thirty minutes to get through all of the abandoned ships in one area, then I had to jump to a different one. The second one had twice as many ships to explore, which were more difficult so that took about an hour and thirty minutes. The third took even longer and so on. It is in no way a small game. In fact, it is quite the opposite.\n\nThe gist of the story is that you are a human stranded in the middle of nowhere, using a computer to remotely pilot some drones into infested ships, trying to gather fuel and scrap to make more trips to more ships whilst trying not to lose your drones to what lurks inside. You hear and see what your bots hear and see through equipment from the 70s, which baffled me a bit at first. At first I thought “space exploration is very clearly a thing of the future, especially travelling through galaxies. It has been nearly fifty years since we first sent man to the moon. We haven’t gone much further than the moon. Where we stand in the tree of technology has come extraordinarily far. Add a few generations onto that and we are exploring other galaxies and supposedly, we are using microphones, monitors and interfaces from the 70s. #RantOver.”\n\nI was very wrong to think that, because after actually playing the game, I realised that if it weren’t for the old timey feel of the game, Duskers wouldn’t be the beauty that it is.\n\nYou control your drones and the surrounding parts of the ship you are searching using commands. For example, d1 opens up “door 1,” navigate 1 r3 orders “drone 1” to navigate to “room 3,” etc. The game consists mainly of these sorts of commands unless you’re manually controlling your drones, which you will need to do frequently to make sure you can easily assist your drone’s escape if it gets into a pickle.\n\nDon’t worry, you won’t be restricted to the two examples above for the whole game. They are the commands that you will most likely use the most as they are essential commands, but your bots also come with upgrades. Upgrades add features to your robots, such as generator which has one of your drones use a power inlet to feed power to the surrounding doors, rooms and interfaces, motion which detects enemy motion in the surrounding rooms and drone’s best friend, tow which allows the towing of almost dead drones and other objects back to airlock 1 to return to your ship, and a bunch more that I can’t fit into one review. You can obtain more upgrades by swapping with dead drones that you can find in derelict ships.\n\nThe infestation is the game’s backbone, what makes it suspenseful and exciting, what makes opening a door scary and what you must constantly be checking for. This is the reason motion is drone’s best friend, because if you don’t check before you open a door and there is an enemy behind it, your mechanical pals might not be coming back. Ever. Duskers being a rogue-like makes it even scarier, one wrong move and you have to start all over again.\n\nThere are more threats than just the infestation, such as security drones which are just as bad, drone swarms which you should steer clear of at all costs, bacterium which multiplies towards you and leapers, which as their descriptive name states, lunge towards you dealing immense amounts of damage. There are also environmental threats such as the vacuum of opening an airlock causing your drones and enemies to fly out of the room, and radiation, caused by having an airlock or doors blocking already irradiated rooms open for an extended period of time.\n\nDon’t worry, hope is not lost if you are in a situation that is going downhill faster than a fat man on a bobsled, there are ways to keep your drones from being destroyed by organic and mechanical life. If you needed to get the enemies out of the room fast, you can use the “Sonic” upgrade, which sends out a sonic pulse that repels organic threats. Maybe you want to attract enemies from nearby rooms to get their attention so you can explore the room they are occupied in, which is when the “Lure” upgrade comes in handy. You can drop a remotely detonated explosive device to blast the threat to pieces if you have the “Trap” upgrade, but if worse comes to worst, which is bound to happen eventually, you can use the “Shield” upgrade which negates incoming damage to the drone that has it equipped (not completely, but maybe just enough to buy you some time.)\n\nIf you think you’ll have trouble and need a bit of reassurance, there is a “Difficulty Options” section under “Options” where you can change a bunch of stuff. I suggest you don’t, because it takes away the difficult and original “Duskers feel,” but it’s there if you want it.\n\nDuskers doesn’t have save/load points, instead it overwrites the other save points with the current one. There is no way to save to an external file so you can re-load if you think you might lose some drones in a ship or have misclicked on something and spent half your scrap fixing a drone you wanted to trash. That means if you make a mistake, you can say goodbye to your game. I ended up accidentally travelling to a ship I had already explored before. Whoops! Bye bye two days worth of fuel.\n\nThe game is astonishingly (and surprisingly) atmospheric, which I believe to be one of the key elements in any game. Duskers is a great example of something that can be as simple as “controlling some robots through a screen that the 70s thought the future of technology was going to look like” being this amazing.\n\nOverall Duskers has impressed me a lot and I’m sure if you get past the common first glance scenario it’ll impress you too. There are a few minor issues here and there but if you get past them Duskers is truly an awesome game. It is an experience you won’t forget any time soon, I certainly won’t.\n\nI rate Duskers 9/10 Australian flags.","May 26","true","6.1"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","12","17","2","2"

I'm absoultly hooked, the console command adds such a dimension, and just as you get more savvy with it, whoosh - 'Drone 1 has left the derilict' via the air lock..Nooooooo, he was my best drone! The more you play, the more the depth and harshness of poor decisions hit you. the interchangable modules on each drone (3 slots each) really plays a part. The closest so far was sneaking in a new airlock, swaping my 'Tow' module over to remaining Drone and pulling his other two downed mates back in for a hasty escape and much configuring of resources once home on current ship. So much fun and stratagy with powering doors, usuing motion scanners to trap nastys, then firing up defence guns to politley dispose of them for you. Setting traps, again utilizing airlocks to suck bad robots, swarms and rather red stuff before radiation renders room unuseable etc.\n\nI've really got into indie games this year, i was always panicing about my graphic card and system specs with high end 3d titles, however, so i really recoomend investing in this great title and casting off any snobbery. Trust me the retro 'Alien & Bladerunner' console beeps along with noise on the video screen really are great. So simple, but such a satisfying game with a little patience. You really feel that remote control and desperation for your ship and drone survival.\n\nStill in alpha, can only improve, but so good as it is already.

Don't let the Steam play-timer fool you, I've played this game extensively on an external hard drive off of my main computer.  With the most bare-bones of background stories given to you at the beginning, you're tasked with figuring out for yourself what happened to everyone, as well as where (and possibly when) you are as you scavenge through scores of abandoned, broken-down, dead husks of ships and space stations with skittish little drones and dilapidated equipment that insists on breaking down on you at the worst possible times.  The UI is simplistic and a bit strange to anyone who didn't grow up in the DOS era, but it's very easy to get the hang of.  The fact that the entire game is played via keyboard (no mouse input), in my opinion, actually adds to the experience.  Couple that with playing the game alone in a dark room, and you can really convince yourself that you're the one piloting these little buggers remotely from your crumbling safe haven aboard a lone starship in a dead universe.\n\nI've seen this game described as "survival horror."  I don't necessarily agree with such a label, but more than once Duskers has had me nervously edging forward on my seat, holding my breath as I pry open a malfunctioning hatch, terrified of what I might be unleashing on the other side.  More than once the game actually succeeded in making me violently jump in surprise, slamming on the keyboard like an epileptic orangutan with a hyperactivity disorder as I desperately tried to coerce my uncooperative fingers into typing out the chain of commands necessary to save whatever drones I could, slamming hatches shut to keep the unseen horrors from getting aboard my docking ship.\n\nAfter a while, once you figure things out, the game *does* have a tendency to get a little repetitive, but random mishaps keep you on your toes, disrupting your usual routine once in a while and helping break the tedium before it gets bothersome.  Airlocks may fail randomly, your drones' video feeds will cut out leaving you temporarily blind, a section of a derelict's hull may buckle and allow lethal radiation to leak into the ship you're exploring.  There are few times aboard any of the derelicts where you feel truly safe and secure.\n\nTo Misfits Attic, I say "bra-vo."  Keep up the good work.  I look forward to how development of this game progresses.","March 10","true","14.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

'Motion' can't even detect the room it's in 90% of the time, much less adjacent rooms. Stealth as a module is absolutely required to start off with(due primarily with how useless motion is), and most times you won't start with it. There are other 100% neccessary mods to find in order to (succesfully) raid ships you will need to pray the game gives you due to how nerfed a base mod  like motion is, or simply you have no capability to deal with certain enemies without 1 specific mod.\n\nAs the game progresses, RNG will refuse to give you certain ship mods 100% neccessary to progress in the game. Such as quarrintine bypass or transporter to get on certain locked vessels.\n\nThe 'end game' consists of, as far as I can tell, peddling along till you have to restart because all modules are at impossibly high failure rates to destroy themselves with no ability to repair them because of the game's stingyness with giving scrap to repair things. The logs to "piece together' what happened to the galaxy are often uninteresting, and you will quickly get enough different ones to know exactly what happened to everyone. Leaving no further incentive but to peddle the RNG bike till you stop getting enough scrap for basic repairs.\n\nYou can adjust breakdown rates and scrap rates in the options, but I am leveling my judgement at the intended base balance of the game. My judgement is game balance is poorly thought out in effort to force the player to 'diversify' their tactics in a game where you have no options to diversify your tactics unless you've already had the game hand you victory several times over in the form of a wider selection of mods. I've watched developer videos, and he often conflates the game softballing him wealthpacked ships with tactical prowess.  At which point you naturally succeede if you've already had the game hand you every mod you need.\n\nAs is, the only viable tactic is gaining the ability to safely scout out rooms ahead of time for threats, but the ability to do so is limited. Even if you manage to spot a threat without endangering yourself, your ability to clear it or redirect it is entirely RNG rather than a factor of player skill.\n\nI really can't recommend it. Which is a shame. The gameplay is fun, but the problems with balance dead end even really good runs in to pointlessness after long enough.","March 25","false","11.8"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","18","29","0","0"

This is a good game to accompany Invisible Inc., another procedurally generated stealther.\n\nDuskers is realtime, not turnbased or quasi-turnbased.  Oddly enough I found myself thinking about the old NES game The Lost Vikings while I was playing Duskers.\n\nPerhaps more so than other roguelikes, this game forces you to press on after a failure.  If you aren't willing to accept a sub-optimal outcome, you're never going to visit more than 2 or 3 systems because of all the resetting you're going to do.

It is quite satisfying to have your team of drones running around, collecting, herding unknown entities into turret traps, and finding new drone friends to fix up and gear out.

Stratagy because you have to plan ahead, crawler because you explore dead spaceships that have long been abandond.\nSure the graphics are not so good but HOLY CHEEZE this game is tense. Each room had me against the wall scared to death on what would happen to my poor little drones! You cannot control them directly, and it has permadeth. STRESSFULL.\nNot only that, the enemies have supprized me on a number of occations. The sound design for the enemies has gotten me on a number of occations, and it adds on to the suspence.\nYou also have to do lots of Ellen Riply manuvers in order to survive. This really adds some great replayability, especially with the intruiging story. Sometimes before I board a ship I get occasional messages from an unknown person, witch adds on to the mystery of what is going on and what is happening.\nAll in all, this is a small indie gem full of susspence, suprise and thinking.

The alias function I like so much, now has variables.\nThe story is fleshed out (told through logs that are uncovered as you board more and more deadly derelicts).\n\nThere are a ton of objectives to get into once you have the survival part down.\nFor example, I'm doing a mission where you have to commandeer a large Mutaki derelict without powering up a generator and wiping the computers. So I can't suck enemies out of airlocks or herd them in to rooms. I have to use a pry while another drone stands by with a turret.\n\nThere are daily and weekly challanges.\n\nThe whole game has a great ballance between feeling really rewarding when you do well and infuriating when you lose it all.\n\nOver 180hrs in and I am far from burned out. Absolute gem.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nI really like this game, and I can see it being popular amongst coders and *nix users alike.\nThere is something called an alias, that at the moment behaves more like a macro. You can bring up a note pad and type in a sequence of commands divided by a semicolon, these are called from an alias you give them, thus the name.\n\n--ex. truck = navigate 3 1; tow 3; navigate 3 r1; tow 3This is an alias I'd use to call my tow drone to my explorer and pick up a ship upgrade or other retrievable salvage.\n\nThey are already fun and full of potential in their current state, but the developers are keen to flesh this system out adding variables and delays for starters. The syntax is simple (a little like tcl, partly because it's not esoteric, or overly complex but is still powerful.. mainly though because you're typing one liners, of commands seperated by semi colons.. just.. like.. in tcl :D).\n\nThere is a tutorial and starter galaxy but they just cover the basics and from there you are on your own. They have said that they don't want everything made clear and the intention is to have players discover mechanics through playing, reading logs and experimenting.\n\nAliases, as an example, were originally a text file in the games folder with no explanation.\n\nThe developers really care about making this as good a game as possible, while not trying to cater to a low common denominator.\n\nAt the moment the community is somewhat niche but robust and I only see it growing.\n\nGreat devs pushing boundaries with a great game that seems to attract some really great, intelligent people.. Can not recommend enough.","November 26, 2015","true","186.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Somehow, it kind of reminds me of the original X-Com games, in that it's deliberately hard and you will fail.  You will fail many, many times.  And I love that aspect.  I loved those games, I've loved many, many roguelikes over the years, and I thought I'd love this game too.\nBut I don't.  I can't really put my finger on it.  It's got all the elements needed to be a harsh, unforgiving game that gives a sense of accomplishment when you finally do well, but it just doesn't.\nPerhaps that's because there's no actual sense of accomplishment.  Salvaging another ship?  Eh, you're worse off 9/10 times (get one scrap, need 10 to repair your failing modules.  Also no fuel).  Finsihing a system?  As usual, your ship is worse off than before.\nPerhaps it's because you can have completely unwinnable galaxies to start in, thus causing a good hour long wait until you find one you can actually get through (all your drones died after opening your first door, congrats, time to restart).\nPerhaps it's the fact that there are a few pretty much 'necessary' pieces of equipment that don't seem to ever spawn (interface, motion).\nMaybe I just don't like the idea that the point is to use as few of your modules as possible.  Every time you find yourself needing to type 'stealth' or 'trap' or, god forbid, 'remote' for the first time on a ship, you just KNOW you've ruined any chance of actually accomplishing something 'this time'.\nPerhaps the fact that your drones can literally get stuck between two boxes during 'navigate' commands, forcing you to abandon them, is incredibly iritating to me.\n\nOr perhaps I paid for an hd screen, and the blurriness of the game detracts from it and gives me a headache.  The 'retro-future' thing has gotten a little old at this point.\n\nSome people like it.  That's fine.  Personally, I think it's terrible.","May 27","false","5.9"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","0"

It's very sure what it wanted to be and aimed for it, and I can assure you that it is every bit as fun as it is tense.\n\nAnd oh boy, does it get REALLY TENSE. We're talking your abs are tighter than you ever thought possible with sweat on your brow, all the while your fingers are shakingly awaiting the immediate and sudden need to belt out a command to slam a door shut to save your drones from certain destruction.\n\nMeanwhile, or even when this is NOT happening, you are pensive. Scared, since every single room could be the very last you ever open. Relying on equipment that may be working perfectly, but will eventually start going faulty, and may even fail entirely mid mission, forcing you and your terrified little harem of drones must adapt to the situations at hand.\n\nWeapons exist, but are few and far between. I have yet to find even one that wasn't a mine or trap of some kind. That aside, you have your brain, your other tools such as motion sensors, the ability to access destroyed ship terminals to scan for items, scraps which are used as currency and are also the only way to repair or buy anything, or use the defense turrets (If there are any) to remove the hostile entity. (There are more than one. I've encountered 3 different types so far.)\n\nThe enemies have this air of mystery about them. since the only way for you to "see" the world is through the grainy, often glitchy camera of your drones, it only adds to the suspense as you inch closer to what could be your next big pay off, or your last inch you'll ever inch.\n\nThe atmosphere is spectacular, the premise is nothing NEW with the whole "Last man alive? In space!" situation, but it's executed in such a unique way, being that you are NOT the save-it-all badass solution to the problem, but rather, more frail than your very own drones.\n\nAll of this, and you feel like you're actually the guy running the drones because they game operates entirley through an interface similar to the command prompt on any PC.\n\nI absolutely love this game. It's one of the only rouge-likes I've ever enjoyed. Even with the deaths being permanent, and there is no real progress aside from the mystery to solve (Which you keep uncovered logs per death) there are no levels or stat progression. Only you, the upgrades you put on your drones, and your skill as an operator.\n\nIn a way, this reminds me of Dark Souls. Vaguely, with that similar feeling of "No matter what, move forward."\n\nBecause in the end, when all is dark and hopeless, will you sit and whimper, awaiting your inevitable demise as all that you knew fades into the deep, endless blackness of space? Or will you cling to life, and crawl your way to the answers you seek?\n\nAfter all, is it not but our fate as humans to ever be drawn towards knowledge? Even if you are the last human alive, wouldn't you like to know the answer? "What happened to everyone? How did the galaxy become a graveyard?"\n\n\nTL,DR\n\nFantastic atmosphere, very few games beat it in my eyes. Even Triple A.\nAmazing execution for a simple idea.\nIntriguing story that poses itself more as a question to be answered.\nRouge-like elements are solid.\nYour game has an effect that you can toggle, that makes it look like you're on an old CRT style screen.\n\n>navigate all r1\nnavigating all drones to r1\n>a1\nairlock 1 closed\n>exit\nare you sure you want to disengage boarding with this vessel?

Will command console again.\n\nClaustrophobia is an immediate feeling I get from this game.  And fear.  The same feelings Ripley had as she trawled through vents of the Nostromo listening to the creaks and clunks, wondering if terror is lurking around the corner, as the motion scanner bip-bip-bips away on a vector based fuzzy screen.\n\nThere are no aliens in Duskers.  No more alive that is.  Only drones.  Which are about as friendly as the Xenomorph in the Alien movie.  In fact the whole universe appears to be barren, made in to a junk yard, with nothing but derelict ships left scattered all around.  With no sigh of organic life, other than yourself (You’re not a robot, right?).\n\nYou are in command of a ship with limited supplies.  With a handful of drones and a limited amount of supplies there is little chance of survival.  Several wrecks appear on sensors; ready to be boarded one at a time to gather resources and supplies, to fuel your journey out in to space and repeat the process.\n\nYour drones board a derelict ship.  It’s not the first time you have done this and you know it’s safe to move out of the airlock and in to the first room.  Lucy, Carl and Wendy sit quietly, awaiting your command.  A few resources are scattered on the floor.  You instruct Wendy to gather them up, while Lucy is commanded to investigate an open door.  As Lucy enters, your view screen flickers for a moment.  You wonder if she is being attacked briefly.  The room is empty and you know it, just a glitch on the monitor.\n\nA generator is found in the second room and get Lucy to power it, allowing access to other rooms behind the closed doors.\n\nNoises clang and bang around you; the sources out of sight.  It’s several hundred years old; the structural integrity is not what it used to be.  Or perhaps there is a hostile drone wandering around, lurking, deeper inside the ship?\n\nThere are 3 doors leaving out of the generator room, the one you came in from and the other two closed.  Carl has a sensor which can only be dropped and left to scan the room it’s in.  If only you had a scanner to check the surrounding rooms for movement.\n\nYou contemplate your two choices.  Turn back or open one of the closed doors to proceed further in to the bowels of the derelict.  You feel lucky today, ready to take on a bit of risk.  You flip a coin and open the door fate has determined for you.  You hold your breath for several seconds, watching the door with your eagle eyes.  Nothing appears.\n\nYou start breathing normally again.  Typing on the command console, you look away to watch the keyboard, to order Carl through the new route.  Carl chirps as he accepts the command to move through the open door, then a different chirp you hadn’t heard before.  You look up in horror.\n\nA drone swarm has surrounded Carl, his life dropping rapidly.  You hastily command all back to the airlock.  Never have you typed so fast before.  Lucy gets swarmed as she tries to leave the room.  The swarm made quick work of their first prey and poor Lucy isn’t going to last much longer.  The airlock door slams shut behind Wendy, closest to the airlock you managed to save her before the swarm could reach their final quarry.\n\nYou breathe a deep sigh.  Two drones lost, along with their equipment.  You wonder if the supplies Wendy scooped up will be enough to fix Bob, towed out of the last derelict, to scavenge the next derelict.  It’s gotten lonelier out here.\n\nNote: This is a preview of the Early Access Beta.

However, I don't think that opening an airlock and exposing sections of a spacecraft to vacuum should let in "radiation," let alone flood all connected compartments with radiation permanently.

You control drones.\nB. Universe is poopered all over the place.\nC. Unknown Variables that tend to lead to your death.\n\nIn this game, you start with a merry band of drones. Most often named Sarah, Brandon and Matt for myself. You float your ship up to other not really working ships, stations or military facilities and then you send your drones in, and you scout. You find things to get you to the next ship, if you're lucky. And if you're unlucky there will be a monster, or enemy drone that blasts your drone(s) into oblivion.\n\nThe game has almost a puzzle like quality to it, where you have to provide power to the ship so you can open and close doors to explore. If you can funnel an enemy into a location where there is a gun and you can interface with the ship, you can kill it. If all else fails you can open an airlock and suck the thing right out. Just make sure your drones aren't in there when you do. Also make sure that you close the doors quickly before radiation floods the ship.\n\nThe coolest part of this game, to me, is that you control your drones with the arrow keys for movement. Once they're in position you then issue commands via a terminal. If using your arrow keys isn't something you enjoy you can also go to the schematic (overhead) view of the ship and move Donald the wonder drone (drone 1) into room 4 via keystrokes [Example command: Navgiate 1 r4].\n\nThe game is immersive in a surprising way, from the subtle ship noises to the drones whirring away.\n\nOn occassion mistakes were made, and I understand why they were my fault. Activating a defense turrent while Drone 1 is standing there tends to end poorly for drone 1. Opening the airlock with your drone there, as mentioned before will suck your drone out to dance with Dave among the stars.\n\nFirst time I did that I forgot to move my ship to a new airlock, and I moved all the drones to the adjacent room to airlock. Opened it, had no more drones.Fwoosh. You're going to start over a lot, but when you have to do so you get to keep the logs you find from the ships, but that's all. After enough exploration or dying, in theory you'll have discovered a wonderful story.\n\nIf by some miracle you can make it out of the first area (kidding, it's not that bad) then you get to go to new and exciting locales full of things wanting to kill you too. Maybe not full, but exactly where and when you don't want them to be there.\n\nThere are ship upgrades that you can equip that give you things like better scanners, or the ability to power a point without having to leave a drone on it.\n\nThe developer is active in terms of replying, as well as when I was streaming it they came to sit in and see how I would solve problems, offering advice and tips where applicable.\n\nAt the time of this writing, this is another Indie game that caught me off guard, and I'm glad it did.\n\nWere anyone to ask me if I would recommend this game, I would say yes. Without a doubt. It has provided me with moments worth remembering, some,  if only because I had failed.\n\nI can't wait to continue to get lost in space.","August 23, 2015","true","6.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's a space roguelike, proceedurally generated which means the difficulty will fluctuate depending on luck, and with a refreshingly minimalist visual style.\n\nIn some ways the game is still somewhat unforgiving; there is permadeath and on the overworld screen I pressed enter and acidentally jumped to another galaxy, which spent all of my fuel, so I wish I'd been asked for confirmation first.\n\nBesides the unfinished aspect and an odd crash when trying to record using fraps, it offers quite a bit of charm. I'll go into the highlights first.\n\n1. It's real-time. Turn-based games are beginning to show their age and this instead has several time mechanics; a stealth tool that drains as it is used, enemy AI that moves from room to room, radiation that damages your drones and infiltrates rooms until you close the door, time-sensitive events such as a door suddenly becoming inoperable, etcetera.\n\n2. It's all about finding more fuel. I expect a magical fairy will not land to give you more fuel when you run out going to a rig that didn't have any more for you despite your praying, and so each jump to another node needs to be calculated in advance. While this isn't convenient, it gives the game some realism, and makes you think about what it might be like operating a real drone out in space somewhere and how to make your sparce resources work (Think Apollo 13).\n\n3. It reminds me of the matrix. The third movie, that is, since the matrix number 1 and 2 were not really robotic but rather about virtual reality. But I suppose green lettering is really all I've got to back that up.\n\n4. The command system is intuitive. You can type "Na 1 3" and it means navigate drone 1 to get to the room drone 3 is in. It auto-completes. It generates. It tows the husk back to the ship. This is very necessary really since nobody really wants to just play a tow-truck simluation. (Airport simulator cough cough). Instead the foundation has been laid for good things.\n\nsome gripes\n\nThe fraps crash issue... it couldn't resolve some resolution bug.\nThe lack of confirmation screens and/or random disasters just being a game-over scenario.\nAlmost painful visuals. Yes I know that it's perhaps part of the appeal, but I'd rather look at grey walls than neon lights. Having said that, textures have been done already, and so a game that provides us with maximal gameplay and minimal fuss is pretty neat.\n\nHere, see my video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxjbT-gbeZU","August 25, 2015","true","3.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Once you explore a few ships you will experience all this game has to offer (for the base gameplay). But the adventure and lore is very interesting. The risk of opening one more room without the proper tools is exciting, and most always makes me lose a drone.\n\nThe minimalist visuals and UI make for a very imaginative experience and you get lost in the management of the drones and planning.\n\nHighly recommended.

By the time I come back to a game I've covered, I've often forgotten the basics. I have to say that this game took me by surprise as it isn't as hard as I thought it would be.  It seems as though I got around with just a few basic commands, though there are advanced ones and (thankfully) a help menu available.  My favorite part is trying to figure out how to loot the ships I come across whilst avoiding the enemies, though I have to admit I am also enjoying the discovery aspect as in, what will I come across on the next ship?

Jin_D3vil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JD3signs/","591 products in account","Quick Summery\n\n+Game delivers the experience really well.\n-The graphics will put people off, but I think they will miss out.\n+Delivers shocks and tension better than a lot more expensive games.\n\n-The control methods is not going to appeal to everyone.\nHowever I think the controls are fundamental to the experience.\n\nInitial Impressions\n\nThis game is really fun Sci-Fi puzzle game. You can say it is a rogue like in some ways as there is an element of death and having to restart. But you are often able to come back from mistakes so I don't think this is the kind of game that fits the rogue like genera as most people would define it. While you can be killed because of a mistake much later on, the game isn't so brutal as to kill you immediately unless you are really unlucky. There is an element of luck to it for certain, but you really need to think of what to do with the information you have and weigh up the risks as well. You may find that pushing to get something extra or exploring 'one more room' is not worth what it could costs you. It may sound silly, but leaving with what little you found is often the smart thing to do than risking one more room and losing a valuable drone(s) or much more.\n\nThe game is seen primarily via the terminal of your ship or through the augmented cameras of your drones as you manually control them. The only true image you have is this drone camera which also provides the sounds of the ship or station you are exploring. While normally this kind of disconnect usually reduces the impact of things that happen in the game. This limitation instead manages to genuinely make exploration tense and far more foreboding. This forced reliance on your drones for your survival makes you really fond of your drone team. At the start you'll have three named drones which you can rename if you desire. Each drone will have different equipment equipped and may vary in some stats (health seems to be the main stat difference early on). They also have different designs and can look unique amongst themselves, which helps give them 'personalities'. Making one drone your explorer and another a recovery drone will entail different levels of affection and a strange bond forms because of this. It may be more to do with what each drone has equipped and what their loss will mean initially. But after a while you'll not want to lose them, or at least I didn't.\n\nMy first exploration drone was called Anthony and he was a brave little soul. He would go delving into unknown rooms that I wasn't always sure if they were safe or not without complaint. Stupidly at one point I accidentally killed him with the defence gun of a ship I was exploring. I had forgotten to disable it before I moved him into the room to pick-up scrap and he got killed because of my input blunder. I dutifully sent in Derek who had a Tow to recover him and take him home to the ship. While Anthony wouldn’t be used during the rest of the ship exploration I was glad he wasn't lost to me. He had done his job so many times I had genuinely grown fond of him and his three friends who had been with him for so long. Perhaps it's because I am reliant on them so much that they feel like important members of the crew, and while they are fundamentally replaceable they had earned my respect. I ended up losing my entire team and failing at a later stage due to my own errors. This fondness however had changed how I approached problems and exploration and I assume from now on I may play completely different again.\n\nThe graphics are really great for what they are representing. But I don't think they will appeal to a lot of people because at a glance it doesn't look like much at all, and they may just dismiss this game. Which is frankly a real shame as it is genuinely a really unique experience to play and it manages to deliver more tension and shock than a lot of horror games have done in a while. The game sets out to do something and it does it really well, it reminds me a lot of the Alien films and games. The premise is one of real interest and lends itself to the idea of trying to survive against the unknown. All without hugely expensive graphics and effects, with really simple and well thought out designs.\n\nThe Drones are controlled via command line inputs, and while you can manually navigate you will always use the command line to interact and pick-up things. For a lot of people this will be a really annoying thing and I can imagine a lot of people will feel the controls could be changed. But I think the controls are central to how you play the game and the experience as a whole. It is very close to what the poor survivor is using and creates the feeling of having no real direct control on your fate and reliant on the drones is the key thing that makes this experience work as well as it does.","May 19","true","3.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a good game but I have some problems with it.\n\nScrap is far too hard to save up because module/drone maintenance and repairs take up all of your scrap. Needs to have more scrap in the ships for me to use so I don't have to play 5 rounds in a row with no mistakes whatsoever to get enough to make a simple gather module.\n\nThis is my own personal opinion, but I would rather have a stun gun that I have to aim with and all that jazz than a EMP device and laying traps down. Fighting with aim-weapons should be rewarding with more scrap and stuff. The interface turrets are not always there and are dangerous because they are fully automated and will kill your drones, but they are also super easy to operate and have no downsides other than targeting you if not turned off because they instantly kill everything that is walking around near them. It would be a bit more fun to aim them yourself, and when you fire it, all the enemies in the room or rooms with open doors will try to attack it. And of course, not being instant kill, but not something rediculous like 20 hits.\n\nNeeds more action. It's heart-pumping and scary but only because you are trying to sneak around everything. I like the concept of the game but it would be great to have an optional top-down-shooter mode that you aren't always able to use. Starting from a stun gun and eventually finding a lethal weapon, making upgrades to it and finding better ones (such as burst fire or more ammo size) on direlects. Of course it would make more sense to only find one of each so that you have to bargain which drones should have what gun or none at all.\n\nThe stealth just gets a little tedious to me after some time.

Upgrade your ship and drones as you survive and outhink the various enemies.\n\nThe art style is very "programmer" and nicely done.  You issue commands to your drones through a text console.\n\nThis game is very unique and quite challenging. I highly recommend it.

The mechanics are brilliant, and the subtle world building is pretty much on point throughout. It's the first rogue-like where I don't want to look up any strategies/story elements so that I can really uncover them myself organically. Cannot recommend this enough.\n\nA slightly longer breakdown:\n(tl dr: Failures are your own fault, but make more interesting choices)\nThe extra level of abstraction between "you" and your interaction with the world really makes the game outstanding. At times you feel like a puppetmaster as you scoure the ships and stations with efficiency, removing and avoiding threats. And then in the next moment you'll open a door without thinking and it comes crashing down. It leaves you with just enough time to realize what's happening, but maybe not enough to save yourself. And when you do slip the game doesn't just end the decision tree. Instead you have the chance to fix your mistake, provided you're clever enough (an brought some common tools).\n\nAlso check out alias, it lets you make your own commans, which is great for automating some of your routine tasks & creating emergency protocol.","November 24, 2015","true","21.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The developer has obviously put a lot of thought into this project, and it will be great to see the finished product. Especially, I am looking forward to (hopefully): better AI pathing when using the navigate command; a slightly shallower difficulty curve re: module failures occuring not at all to multiple failures within a few minutes of exploration (several drones lost multiple modules while powered down and still in r1, with a1 closed, which doesn't feel realistic to me); more module variety and more upgrades for the modules; differences between drone bodies, besides the outline and report sound, like speed vs starting hp, etc.; more compelling reasons to commandeer ships than just mission completion/ upgrade slots, like special perks on different ship types; tweaks to the console input for better keyboard response and maybe some visual options like placement and text color, etc.; more variety in early mission ship layouts so it doesn't feel redundant when restarting. Otherwise the gameplay is solid if a little daunting at first. I rarely take direct control over the drones any more unless it is at the start of the mission, since you have to unless the first room is revealed, or when needing to position a drone in a specific way.","August 23, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's an indie game in the best possible way: it's a unique experience created by a small team of people.\n\nI went into the game not really knowing what the gameplay would be. Roguelike, drones, salvaging, puzzles. There was enough of a tease to get my interest, but not enough to spell out what to expect.\n\nThe tutorial was excellent. Taught me the basics, got me into the game. Then the campaign. It starts relatively safe: in-game help messages explain new things as you encounter them, you find some scraps, extra modules, an extra drone.\n\nYou lock enemies in rooms, close the doors behind them, activate defense turrets. Bye, bye enemies. Things are going good. Then you encounter a room your sensors can't penetrate. You're uncertain: take a chance at loot, or play it safe? You open the door... Jump fuel. Nice!\n\nYou push on, looking for more loot. Another unscannable room. You take another chance, and enter. A swarm comes out! Before your drone can turn around, the swarm disables it. Your other drones are safe in another room. Eventually, you manage to lock the swarm in a room and clear the rest of the ship. You move on, minus your scout drone. You fumble along, blindly. More rooms with enemies. Some you can escape from, some you can't. Tension rises. One by one, room by room, you lose your drones, until they are all gone.\n\nGame over. Do you want to play again? Hell yeah!\n\nThis game pushes a lot of your mental buttons. In one game, you scan everything, you're super careful and you scout everything. Next game you only have a stealth module and you're sneaking through quickly. Sometimes you can't obtain perfect information and you have to take chances. Sometimes they pay off, sometimes they... don't. The derelicts get bigger, the enemies nastier, the situations more complex.\n\nEdit: I wrote this originally after 8 hours of playing. That was 10 beta releases ago. The game has only gotten better since then. Modules wear down over time. Your ship has things you can equip to it, but they also wear down as you use them. You are encouraged to commandeer other ships and use them to continue in your quest to figure out what happened to the universe.\n\nI have a Let's Play series going that I restarted with Alpha 0.301 (late December 2015), when more story elements got added to the game. If you are unsure about buying the game, you might find it useful to see some gameplay:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6mHKIABWwg","August 25, 2015","true","36.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Tl;Dr at end.\n\nThe premise is that the galaxy is near enough void of all human life and you are to search derelict ships in order to pice together what caused this sudden end to humanity. To explore the ships you take control of a squad of up to 4 active drones and salvage what you can whilst avoiding hostiles.\n\nDealing with the hostiles is, for me, what makes the game great. Every hostile can be dealt with in some form or another but so can you. As an example i had a drone with a stealth upgrade and equipped with a gatling gun. At first it was great but then you find slime and your whole way of life comes to an alarming crash.\n\nIssuing orders is done through a command line system (dont worry its pretty simple). The command line system does not allow split second actions. If your drone gets jumped on you have to type furiously to save it, as well as the others, from certain death. You will often find yourself with a drone going through a door and getting attacked because you have forgotten to take one of many precautions, before you know it the drone is dead and the hostile has promptly moved through the open door to reign havoc.\n\nIts not all positive at this time in developement. Currently there is very little hand holding other than the starting tutorial. No database of hostiles or anything. its not game breaking but i will put this down to early access. There are very few bugs (i've not seen any).\n\nThe biggest downside though is the lack of information about the world you are in. Although i am not really that far into the game i still feel you could learn more about the world. The best way for me to describe it is by comparing this to deadnauts where you can learn every last little detail about everything. However im sure this will be remedied in the future.\n\nLastly The devs are very active on the steam forum. I think a dev has replied to every thread i have read!\n\nTl;DR\n+Solid addictive gamplay\n+Large choice of strategies\n+Rougelike\n+CMD line system is cool and adds a sense of peril to your encounters\n+Simple but effective graphics\n+few bugs\n\n-Tutorial is the only help you get\n-Would like more info on things like hostiles and backstory (see deadnauts)\n-Some gameplay features feel like bugs when you first start out.","August 24, 2015","true","9.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Even in early access, it already does so many things right!\n\nGraphics: I LOVE the whole "get a partial image of what the drones see but not the complete image"!\nAtmosphere: Turn out your lights, put on your headphones and lose yourself in the command role you take on! The background noise, clicks and drone noises are superb! The universe feels so empty and exploring these derelict ships seems eerie and creepy, love it!\nGameplay: I LOVE THE CONSOLE COMMAND! Piloting drones using a CLI feels soo satisfying!\n\nPart luck, part strategy. Use what tools you have to explore, gather, and deal with threats, sometimes in creative ways.\n\nCollect precious resources that never seem to come in adequate quantities, leaving you with that much more of a feeling of desperation and isolation. Know this - you will not be hoarding resoruces. You'll be using them as quick as you find them.\n\nScrap goes quick after a certain point, using it for repairs and upgrades. Fuel is life, never leave a room unexplored if you can help it.\n\nFailing technology fits so nice in this game. When you hear an alert and see your drone video signal lost, there is a sense of urgency and panic.\n\nIt seems like surprises await at every corner and you have to be able to react quick with those console commands to get your drones to safety.\nThings I'd like to see imrpove:\n\nMore varying Drones and/or drone "types". Maybe you find a smaller drone that can fit through ventilation shafts and get to rooms otherwise inaccessable.\nCombat between drones could use some love. You see some dots fly out and then it breaks into pieces.\nChance to repair failing technology while exploring a ship, but maybe requires extra scrap to do so "on the fly"?\nMore audio noise variations. Bumping into walls, firing a weapon, creepy ship noises, etc.\nAbility to craft more things, other than just a generator and gatherer.\nSomething to tie the loose end of running out of fuel and restarting...are you a different pilot? Did you die? Are you somebody else? What happened?\nAbility to clear destroyed enemy drones debri, especially from doorways so you can close them again.\n....Speaking of enemy drone debri...you would think you could at least collect them for scrap...or module "parts" :)\nCreate new modules after you collect so many parts.\nIf I am controlling my drones...then...who is controlling the enemy ones...? DON DON DON!! (Maybe this gets explained?)\nFeel free to point out things I might not know that are already in the game and maybe I just haven't experienced that yet!\n\nFantastic game so far!","August 24, 2015","true","11.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I fondly remember playing Moria, Rogue, Nethack, and Angband back in the day on my old DOS and early Windows machines, and this is probably the best spiritual successor to those classics that you'll find on Steam.\n\nYou start off with a handful of drones in various states of disrepair, totally alone in the universe. Your objective is ostensibly to piece together what happened, but ultimately your primary goal is to survive by scavenging what you can, making repairs when you must, and always, ALWAYS thinking about the consequences of your actions.\n\nDo you open that last door, hoping to find a motherlode of scrap, or do you cut your losses and move on to the next ship, just in case Door #3 holds some alien obscenity waiting to eat the faces of your robotic proxies?\n\nIn so many AAA games that boast freedom of choice, actions do not really have consequences. Not so with Duskers. Every decision you make, every action you take can make the difference between survival or clambering back into your cryo-pod and praying the autopilot takes you to a nicer neighborhood on the next go-'round.\n\nDuskers is tense, sometimes nerve-wracking, and ultimately one of the better thrill rides I've been on. The retro interface sets you back from the action, but only just far enough for you to think a few four-letter words as red status messages blare across the command console while one by one your drones' feeds go dark and you struggle to slam doors, use lures and traps, and  save what you can. Your trusty ship sometimes also proves untrustworthy, and my nerves have started singing on more than one occasion when the main map feed goes dark as I try to herd some xeno terror into the nearest convenient airlock.\n\nExplore. Scavenge. Survive... and try to figure out just what in blazes happened to the rest of humanity.","May 25","true","6.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It was simple, always check the motion detector before opening a door. If anything was moving, then I would leave the door alone and search elsewhere. Duskers is not a game about getting comfortable with a system, it is a game about improvised solutions and the all-consuming entropy of an uncaring universe. The motion detector began to wear out with use, and sometimes the readings were... inconclusive. Once, "Inconclusive" meant "Danger", and I found out the hard way.\n\nThe creature fell upon my drone with a thud, followed by the beeping of alerts as my terminal informed me that Drone 1 was reporting damage. I tried to move my drone back through the door, and to shut the door on the creature, but the doors of interstellar craft are built with the same high technology as elevator doors, and they refused to close as the creature and my drone were obstructing them. My video feed grew garbled as the beast smashed my drone out of commission, its twisted metal husk still blocking the door.\n\nI considered sending one of my other drones to tow the wreckage back to my boarding craft so I could repair it, but that risked having the creature destroy two drones instead of just one. I considered sending the drone to at least salvage the equipment that my stricken drone was carrying, but I wasn't sure if the creature could move past the broken drone or not. There was only one thing to do; I had to get rid of the creature before I could try to mount a rescue operation. I looked at the schematics of the ship, and realized that there was an operable airlock only a room away from where the creature had made its nest. I typed the commands to open the door to the adjoining room, and the airlock. My terminal beeped and announced that the rooms were exposed to the cold vacuum of space. In an instant the creature was swept out into the void... as was my damaged drone.\n\nWith one mistake I had lost both a drone, and my motion sensor. I made do though, because defeat is not to my taste. On my next excursion I brought along a suite of deployable sensors that I had salvaged earlier. They could only scan the room they were in, but that was alright. I took to scouting by placing a sensor in a secure room, retreating back to safety, and then remotely opening a door to an unexplored room. Then I would wait, and see if anything wandered out. That waiting, the uncertainty of whether the room beyond was actually safe, or if I had simply not waited long enough, was possibly the most nerve wracking experiences I've had at my computer.","May 25","true","5.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I love this game, but it's not gonna be for everyone.\n\nIt's a roguelite, or roguelikelike, or whatever terminology you wanna use.  Which means you're gonna find yourself in a corner and having to [R]eset through no obvious mistake of your own.  Which to me is only a problem if I don't know that going into the game.  You CAN turn off 'permadeath,' but even if you leave it on like a big boy/girl, the story/journal entries carry over so you're still progressing the story.\n\nAnd what little I've seen of the story is doing a really good job of egging me on.  Some good hard sci-fi stuff here.\n\nThe action is a slow burn.  Tense, but not frantic.  Uncomfortable but not jumpscary.  Which I love.  I'm gettin old and I can't 360 noscope noobz like back in the day, so having something I can take my own time with is nice.\n\nBut that's not to say it's boring.  It doesn't get the adrenaline running often, but it does always have you feeling just a little tense.  Why can't your motion sensors detect beyond that door?  You COULD drop a probe, but you've only got one left, and you're short on fuel, but if there's a...something...back there, you're gonna lose an irreplaceable drone....\n\nLots of fun.

I hate when people compare games to certain titles that are destined to be classics such as FTL or Binding of Isaac because it almost feels like people are trying to lure that particular crowd into something lesser. In this case, I can definately feel FTL in here. Not anything near a copy, just that addictive space kind of deal. Essentially, Duskers has the anxiety of the Aliens movies with the VHS camera fuzz and unknown things moving through dark corridors. You are working through what looks like a DOS prompt terminal. You use keywords to control the drones.\n\nThe main problem with this game is that you cannot capture the awesomeness through LetsPlays or trailers. Trust me, I watched hours of this to try to find out why its getting rave reviews. I was bored watching it - but fortunately playing it is a whole other deal.\n\nPros:\n+Really fresh game mechanic that creates awesome puzzles\n+Commanding the drones through the prompt makes you feel like a boss. A hacker boss to be precise.\n+Graphics work and minimal sound are great\n+Uncovering the story of what happened is really cool and edgy\n+Quite addictive - 'just one more go' kind of game\n+I love games where all you need is the keyboard - perfect for laptops\n\nCons:\n-It is expensive, which makes it difficult for people who are on the fence (perhaps they should have a one level demo)\n-I am just entering mid-game, so I am sure more will come up\n\nI see myself playing alot of this.","September 5, 2015","true","6.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","1","2","2","0"

I like the challenge to get through each mission, the antagony of not knowing if I will make it scavenging for Fuel Sources, Scrap and Delightful Upgrades and Additional Robotic Members of the team. The Enemy is Unknown, and you WILL encounter it, it is merciless and if you don't keep a cool head you will loose you best Robot Buddy if not all of them and your only desperate asset for survival.\nThe Game is like nothing else I have ever seen, it is a dream. If you like to think about movement along the lines of designing ideas or methods of exploration in hostile environments or trouble shooting to maneuver around an extremely efficient uttelry over powering enemy this game is something you should not waste any time on.\nI feel I am kind of rambling on, because I am about to continue with my second attempt to get a long ways into things and discover what the heck happened to all of humanity,\nThis game may seem like it's bare bones, but all the speculation you could ever produce through watching the Video Streams and Reading these reviews will never grant you the satisfaction that we have gained through spending the 18 Bones and enjoying a truly AWESOME and Fantastic Game Developed upon some extremely fascinating Ideas, I am looking forward to where this one is going, Long Live Duskers!!! :)","May 19","true","30.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In fact, not only mystery, but horror as well. To start you off, you're taught the very simple control schemes of the game; Issue orders using a command line, and control your drones with the arrow keys. Simple, intuitive, and easy to get used to. But as soon as the tutorial is over, you dive right into the ever-expansive universe of Duskers. With nary a directive but to board what ever ship you happen to start near and gather precious scrap and fuel. Immediately you can begin to feel just how lonely this world is. How haunting it is. The only way you experience this world is through the very vulnerable camera feeds of your cute little drones as they carry out your every command, and the occasional corrupted text log that leaks to you vital, yet fragmented, information. As you begin to explore and test out the waters of the unknown, you begin to realize that though you're alone, you're not safe. Not in the slighest. Normally that realization comes from the sudden beeps, screeches, and explosions from your most favorite drone being torn to pieces by another drone or an unidentifiablly gruesome creature.\n\nThe atmosphere that Duskers sets for you is an inticing one that is hard to pry yourself away from. The sound design of the creaking ships, quiet groans and chatters, occasional whirrs from machines and drones alike. It sets the perfect environment of adventure and mystery. Duskers incites in you an exhilaration to explore and conquer these derelict space ships and stations. An ever-gratifying sense of accomplishment when you bring back a disabled drone, uncover a text log that paints you a story of it's previous inhabitants, or when you find an invaluable upgrade for your drones or ships, even when you mercilessly slay a corrupted defense drone or outsmart one of those terrifying creatures. Duskers likewise will instill into you fear as a nearby bulkhead door breaks open from a creature attacking it, or the panicked beeps of one of your drones suddenly being attacked. It will make you panic when you open a door to a room you thought was empty, only to be confronted by an enemy jumping at you from the shadows. Furiously smashing at your keyboard as you try to close doors, command your drones, and attempt to save as many of your precious little bots as you can. It will give you an air of hopelessness as you watch your last drone become disabled in the bowels of a ghost ship, its camera feed slowly failing as the last of its life drains away. It will rip your heart out when you have to seal a drone in a room crawling with infestations just to give the others a chance at survival. Regretting every keystroke as you type "exit."\n\nDuskers all in all is a thrilling and addicting game that keeps you coming back for more. Dying, though permanent, doesn't feel like a loss. On the contrary, you feel like you're only learning more and becoming more experienced.\n\nSeriously, after spending quite a few hours being sucked into this game, I absolutely love it. I can't wait to fire it up and play more. I can't wait to uncover the secrest this world holds. I'm excited at the mere thought of this game! Misfits Attic did a phenomenal job in the design, and I can't praise it enough. It's challenging, it's rewarding, it's exciting, and it's terrifying. They nailed the atmosphere and the environment. I sat for hours with a friend watching it over my shoulder as we explored, groaning in anguish as we lost drones, cheering when we escaped near death, and jumping at the sight of some enemies.","May 20","true","17.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Once you get the basics down, which takes maybe a couple of hours and one or two resets, it becomes painfully obvious that this game is a glorified version of Solitaire, where it looks like you're doing things but in reality you never have any real choices and what happens during a playthrough is dictated entirely by the whims of the RNG.\n\nExploration this game gets very repetitive very quickly.  Every derelict is the same.  Some upgrades are almost absurdly more useful than others.  Find turret, shield, stealth, interface, and remote power upgrades early and you'll go a long way.   But most of the time you'll just limp along carefully avoiding enemies until you inevitably die anyway.\n\nEventually you'll run out of scrap, fuel, find yourself in a constellation with almost no boardable ships, find your drones stranded by radiation that cut them off from the exit, have your scouting drone get trapped in small or cluttered a room with an enemy and not be able to escape before its stealth runs out, or you'll just typo the wrong door and you'll die and it's back to the beginning.  Very few of my deaths did I feel were my fault nor did I feel I could have done anything to prevent them.  But even then there's no real progression so aside from your losing your drones it doesn't feel like much of a loss and whatever snippets of the story you've found remain.","May 20","false","24.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I'm serious.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I Program computers in my free time when I get bored of video games. My opinion will be skewed by such, you have been warned.\n\nDuskers asthetic is ♥♥♥♥ING WONDERFUL! Seriously! It reminds me of the old computers from days of yore! I LOVE IT TO DEATH!\n\nDuskers has a wonderful tension to it, specifically in the OH ♥♥♥♥ situations that crop up here and there. It sets a wonderful atmosphere and has a deeply interesting world with what little I've seen of it thus far. You use drones to explore derelict ships and scavenge for resources. It's a spectacular experience as you yourself are not directly inside these deathtraps, but the loss of a drone or failure to gather fuel is a constant threat. These risks and threats still feel very immediate even though I can continue if I lose a drone, or don't find scrap.\n\nDo not attack the enemy head on, you will loose countless drones. If you want a FPS or something with lots of shooting, go buy an FPS. Duskers is about being resourceful and intelligent.\n\nYou control your drones through a direct control (arrow keys) and a shell (Command Line). You can only drive a drone with the arrow keys, to do anything more you have to use the shell. It is rather simple and the game has a quick little tutorial, it isn't full blown programming but I still love it to death.\nA quick example of how one uses the shell\n\n> navigate 1 r15\n> gather 1 all\n\nthat would send drone 01 to room 15 and tell drone 01 to gather all the scrap in that room. It's a rather interesting little system.\n\nAlong with these goodies there are upgrades, modules, etc, etc, etc. ALL THE LOOT! (Yes, you can also find disfunctional drones to tow back to your ship, repair, and use in future scavenging runs)\n\nHowever, loot can break. So you have to keep scrapping unneeded loot to keep your good loot in working order or it will become worthless scrap!\n\nThere is equipment for drones, and ship upgrades. A great deal of the ship upgrades are very, very, useful. And I have eyt to run into a single drone upgrade I dislike (but the stealth and shield upgrades are my favorite). Plus, you can commandeer a derelict deathtrap if you can remove all hostiles from it. These ships can have all variety of goodies!\n\nThen, there is my favorite part. The Alias system.\nYou can do some very, very, barebones and very basic automation of drone control with Aliasing.\nA few Examples\n\nA simple shortening of the navigate command for 0# $#!+! moments.\nnav=navigate $x1 ($x2) ($r1) ($d1)\n\nA simple alias to return a drone to the boarding vessel\nhome=navigate ($x1) ($x2) ($x3) ($x4) r1\n\nScan and gather the room a drone is currently in\ngatherscan=scan $x1 ; gather $1 all\n\nTow a disabled drone back to the boarding vessel (haven't tested this one, made up on the fly)\ngetdrone=nav $x1 $x2 ; tow $x1 ; nav $1 r1 ; tow $1\n\n\nEtc, etc, etc\nThe game is ♥♥♥♥ing wonderful!\n\nOh, and a quick note, yes, you can suck stuff out an airlock :D:D:D:D:D\n\nPssst! A quick extra thing!\nDisabled drones still have a video feed! I let you think about how that is useful on your own!","May 23","true","13.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

My friends and i call this line RNG God\n\nIn FTL you can come out of warp into a sun covered with a metor shower having to fight a allready hard foe, with next to to survive it. Thats crossing the RNG line\n\nIn duskers you start off with three drones with one of a few starting set ups. this chooses FOR YOU, which tactics you will employ early in the game. you can try to do your own thing but you are extremely restricted by your starting gear.\n\nI have had a horrible time with the RNG line in duskers, just like in FTL you can be randomly screwed over with the flip of a coin, reguardless of however skilled you are.\n\nMy worst experiance by far was a 1 hour and a 1/2 run where i tip toed through 6 ships to get another drone and an interface moduel to make raiding ships easier. EASIER, not easy.\n\nThe very next ship i go to to start employing use of the new drone and tool. i shift airlocks to deploy a drone elsewhere in the ship and suddenly : RADIATION COMING IN THROUGH THE HULL. directly into the room with all 3 of my drones who are basically keeping eyes on the entire ship.\n\nBefore this mission the ship scans said the hulls intergrity was GOOD. If you randomly change the paramiters of a mission where a constant is known beforehand to be reliable its a sucker punch. This is a prime example of Random difficulty spikes that ruin fabulous games.\n\nI Do NOT recommend this game because of the exsistance of such extreme, random, and game breaking spikes like this.\nA space bound Astroid strike give you a chance to either turn tail or continue, the enemies are fantastic, you can find them and dispose of them multiple ways, even the sudden rouge enemies deciding to open doors they dont like is fun and keeps you on your toes.\n\nBut you cannot come out of left feild with a random sucker punch.\n\nSo TL:DR\n\nThe game duskers is fantastic, from its look, to its form to its story you peice together yourself. I barely even see it being a early access game, it FEELS complete. And i will be playing it for weeks to come.\n\nSadly it is another rouge-like with unpredicable absolutly random difficulty spikes that players will quite likely be unready for, and it may cause undue frustration and a game over.\n\nI do not recommend it unless you are patient, want a game like this for the sheer intrest factor or are a masochist who likes being occasonally sucker punched.","August 23, 2015","false","11.9"," 51 of 105 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","51","105","3","10"

Instead of periodic saves you get Reset; and it means just that, after a few times getting 2 or 3 salvage trips into the game and losing key drones to the ridiculously fast red things. The propsect of going all the way back to the start with randomised abilities on the drones was just too frustrating and dull to contemplate so I gave up. The experience isn't tense, it's annoying; I buy games to enjoy them not to be continually reset - where's the fun in that. At the speed it downloaded there's only about 20 lines of code and no graphics to speak of so a save command doesn't seem like too much to ask. The command line novelty soon wears off as you discover that to close a door in the face of a rapidly advancing red splodge that you don't get to see until the last minute and that your motion sensor didn't warn you about requires a down arrow plus a typed command. The most skilled touch typist on the planet is unlikely to be able to achieve that.\nTake my advice - buy 3 pints of beer, it'll be better value.\n\nIn light of comments and my sense of fair play I thought I'd edit my review after giving this another chance. I spent a couple more hours and actually It's worse than  my previous thoughts. That said read Distantflight's review which is fairer and kinder than the game deserves.\nAn example: After a dozen or so resets both to overcome the random spawning of drones with sub-optimal loadouts and to see if it was possible to get an "interface" in the loadout (it wasn't) in order to use all the terminals that proliferate on ships that you visit. More resets when I didn't survive more than 2 ship vists because the game is hard for an old bloke with a job who has a life but enjoys a bit of recreational (look it up) gaming. Anyhow, I thought I'd cracked it - back on first boarding, should be easy. I new there was a red splodge in a room and I set myself up to retreat through two doors and trap my adversary in a room. It should have worked, a straight line so the counter intuitive arrow controls don't confuse me door close command typed in only waiting for a single keystroke. Drone retreats indistinct enemy follows - brilliant, what a game - just about to exit door 2 and press enter... red streak across intervening space, instant kill. There's such a paucity of resources, salvage and spare drones as well as modules that a player can't absorb the casualties or the repair bill and move on. >Duskers_ Explore . Repeatedly Reset .

A game that makes you think how you should proceed. I've never been one for rogue games but this had me hooked, at least at the start.\n\nBy the time I got to the second system arbitrarily imposed gameplay mechanics suddenly appear. The first one was a compartment that started to flood with radiation. I didn't hang around to find out whether this would continue to flood to other parts of the ship. The second was enemies that spawned INSIDE a room I had already secured. Where they came from I can't say as all doors were shut. The third and final nail for me was artbitrarily disabled doors. One minute they work, the next they don't. Presumably down to the actions of enemies trapped inside, I'm not sure.\n\nThat was enough for me. I thought it was going to be a strategy game, planning your way through a ship and instead it turns into a rush into the ship and grab what you can while you can game. Shame as I really wanted to like this game but if the ruleset changes randomly each time you play then that's not fun for me.

Dangers are plentiful, and often times lurking within your blindspots, waiting for you to make a mistake or become just a little too comfortable with your surroundings.

You control up to four drones at a time either by the arrow keys or by using the game's command line interface. This command line is actually very easy to use and offers to autocomplete most commands after typing just the first few characters. Anyway, you are stuck in space with  nobody around you besides old security bots and several kinds of aliens hiding in the old  derelict space crafts scattered around the universe. You must scavenge these ships to keep your drones and ship running. If your drones are put out of commission, "Its game over, man. Game over!" You will get sucked into the game as you can only watch from afar as  hostile aliens or bots (as far as I can tell, none aren't  hostile)  rip your drones to pieces or as a critical upgrade fails when you thought it could last just a little bit longer.

All you have at your disposal is a small hord of futuristic roomba-like drones.  Your mission is to survive using these robots.  You have to bord derelic spacecrafts and raid them for loot. Some of these ships are dangerous, many of them have alien infestations.  You have to take a bunch of souped up roombas and turn them into space marines.   It's strange, it's funny (well...

You control up to four drones at a time either by the arrow keys or by using the game's command line interface. This command line is actually very easy to use and offers to autocomplete most commands after typing just the first few characters.

The In-game controls are simple and easy to remember (for instance, if you want to open door 18, the command is d18. Easy, right? Or if you want to send some drones into the room behind door 18, which in this instance is room 7 [R7] just type in "navigate [insert drone numbers or names here] R7". And if you are feeling like a keyboard ninja and want to get all of that in one command, just type "d18; navigate  [insert drone numbers or names here] R7". Semi-colons are like spaces in this game, letting you put multiple commands in for simultaneous movements, or even in some cases for chain commands (I think there is some way to actually put in some sort of "logic" code with alias's, but I am not certain how)!\n\nEnemies (6/10): I believe there are four infestation types in the game currently, each with their own fighting style (sentry drones just outright attempt to shoot you, "brutes" charge at you, "swarms" obliterate you (but have audio cue's as well apparently), and "slimes" continually duplicate and begin to fill rooms, possibly trapping you in a certain area! To be honest, I really don't like the whole "swarm" idea, as often when I play games I don't bother to use audio, and having enemies that do a ridiculous amount of damage and can chew through doors is just a bad idea all-round.\n\nModifications/Drone upgrades and repairs (6/10): the idea of modifications is great, it gives you alot of different strategies and customization with your drones. Why is my rating only a 6/10 on this area of my review then? Because repairs. Your drones constantly get malfunctioning cameras, which you will need to repair just in case something bad happens and your cameras go out (thats a whopping seven scrap too!). Your mods also degrage, giving it a "10%" chance of breaking for example (oh, by the way, breaking doesn't mean "It malfunctioned! You cannot use this item for the rest of this mission. It literally means it breakes, it is unusable and can only be salvaged for one scrap (normal mods are three scrap). That really hurts the game-play in my opinion. So if you don't spend your scrap on repairs, what do you spend them on? Well, maybe we could be able to craft mods from scrap, and not just "tow", "gather", and "generator". I am talking about every modification in the game, both for ships and drones. That way I can finally get interface and other great mods that will be less based on random chance.\n\nMaps/Space travel mechanics (ehhhhhhh..... 3/10) I know it's supposed to make you play more strategic, trying not to run out of fuel and stuff but..... in all honestly, it doesn't add anything to the experience for me, and in a way kind of ruins it. The idea isn't bad, but trying to be strategic with your fuel implies that you can actually find fuel, and enough of it. Not to mention the "quarentine" and "transport required" mechanics, because while transport is a cool idea, it should be at least garenteed to have one target be a room with a generator.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Absolutely! It's definitely unique in its style and game-play, and because it hasn't been out long, I'm sure the dev team will do their best to balance some things and add others.","May 20","true","21.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The In-game controls are simple and easy to remember (for instance, if you want to open door 18, the command is d18. Easy, right? Or if you want to send some drones into the room behind door 18, which in this instance is room 7 [R7] just type in "navigate [insert drone numbers or names here] R7". And if you are feeling like a keyboard ninja and want to get all of that in one command, just type "d18; navigate  [insert drone numbers or names here] R7". Semi-colons are like spaces in this game, letting you put multiple commands in for simultaneous movements, or even in some cases for chain commands (I think there is some way to actually put in some sort of "logic" code with alias's, but I am not certain how)!\n\nEnemies (6/10): I believe there are four infestation types in the game currently, each with their own fighting style (sentry drones just outright attempt to shoot you, "brutes" charge at you, "swarms" obliterate you (but have audio cue's as well apparently), and "slimes" continually duplicate and begin to fill rooms, possibly trapping you in a certain area! To be honest, I really don't like the whole "swarm" idea, as often when I play games I don't bother to use audio, and having enemies that do a ridiculous amount of damage and can chew through doors is just a bad idea all-round.\n\nModifications/Drone upgrades and repairs (6/10): the idea of modifications is great, it gives you alot of different strategies and customization with your drones. Why is my rating only a 6/10 on this area of my review then? Because repairs. Your drones constantly get malfunctioning cameras, which you will need to repair just in case something bad happens and your cameras go out (thats a whopping seven scrap too!). Your mods also degrage, giving it a "10%" chance of breaking for example (oh, by the way, breaking doesn't mean "It malfunctioned! You cannot use this item for the rest of this mission. It literally means it breakes, it is unusable and can only be salvaged for one scrap (normal mods are three scrap). That really hurts the game-play in my opinion. So if you don't spend your scrap on repairs, what do you spend them on? Well, maybe we could be able to craft mods from scrap, and not just "tow", "gather", and "generator". I am talking about every modification in the game, both for ships and drones. That way I can finally get interface and other great mods that will be less based on random chance.\n\nMaps/Space travel mechanics (ehhhhhhh..... 3/10) I know it's supposed to make you play more strategic, trying not to run out of fuel and stuff but..... in all honestly, it doesn't add anything to the experience for me, and in a way kind of ruins it. The idea isn't bad, but trying to be strategic with your fuel implies that you can actually find fuel, and enough of it. Not to mention the "quarentine" and "transport required" mechanics, because while transport is a cool idea, it should be at least garenteed to have one target be a room with a generator.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Absolutely! It's definitely unique in its style and game-play, and because it hasn't been out long, I'm sure the dev team will do their best to balance some things and add others.","May 20","true","21.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The rest of my review is from when I first bought the game at the 1.0 release. I am now reviewing it a week later, and some improvements/discoveries have occured. Firstly, they seem to have fixed the door glitches, second, there actually is a way to get the same easy start every time (under difficulty settings), and thirdly, you can make the enemy types reset when you restart, too. I still think there needs to be a more in depth tutorial, because you see different kinds of dangers in the normal gameplay which appear to be environmetnal but you can't be sure (green blobs, etc.) and the effects of depressurization and flooding with radiation, as well as countermeasures, need to be discussed in the tutorial.\n\nThe First Few HoursWhen you first load up this game, you're bound to be excited about the concepts, being alone in the universe with a mysterious breakout happening... What's bound to happen? Well, you'll start your first ship salvage with zero infestations, a quick resource grab that gets you moving a bit on your feet. Then, you'll have to plot your moves more appropriately as every other ship is infested and your drones are vulnerable. As you explore each ship, you may uncover a log relating to what triggered the incident, which you can look back on later. It's a very unique situation, and the gameplay style is just as unique. For the first few hours, this game is pretty enjoyable.\n\nThe BUTOnce you play past the first few hours, this game quickly becomes repetetive and painfully difficult to progress in. You'll probably be very likely to use the Reset option to start over. It doesn't restart a salvage though... It restarts the universe right after the event. You're back to square 1 with a different drone loadout. And that safety net of an infestation-free ship NEVER returrns. For every reset, your first ship is already infested, and a lot older. The levels are a lot harder, and it's really frustrating to try and progress because sooner or later, you'll be bound to make a single mistake that ends up costing you your entire drone fleet. And there's only 1 save file. Oh, and sometimes enemies can kill your drones through CLOSED doors.\n\nConclusionWhile this game would make a great short-term arcade game, I feel ripped off having paid $20 for it. There's not really a chance at progressing very far if you ever reset (which I have) and the enemies are sometimes prone to glitching (at your expense). Short summary: if it's on sale for less than $5, it might be worth your money. As for what I paid, I wish I was still in my return window.","May 21","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","7"

Challenging your progress; a variety of enemies, environmental hazards, and mistakes on your part to be avoided and tackled on your journey to find out what happened to everyone.\n\nDuskers is predominately played in an tactical birds-eye view using a command line interface, with you occasionally needing to take direct control of your drones from an overhead camera in order to navigate past obstacles and arrange your (largely) automated defences. This really adds a lot of character to the game, and really sells the Alien(1979) theme, as you try to guide unseen hostiles away from salvage (drones/repairs/upgrades/fuel), and avoid direct contact where possible/unprofitable.\n\nThe game goes on indefinitely and lore could be better in my opinion, currently there's a lot of quests/"theories" competing with each other to provide context, negating how plausible the universe feels. I was disappointed that there's currently no way to discover data during your operations as I might expect through consoles and salvage, rather you are awarded it afterwards for completing actions before/after. Meaning beyond the grind to accumulate some sweet-♥♥♥ droids, I was missing out on a narrative hook.\n\nRegardless the tutorial is pretty good, and I can imagine many technically minded individuals will get a kick out of using the command-line interface to move their handy little minions, I certainly think it suits the game and plays well, but this defiantly won't be for everyone.\n\nThere's enough in the game to warrant picking up for atmosphere and mechanical quirk alone, so I hope the game sees a lot more support and continues to be iterated on in future, but I was very pleased with my purchase.","June 3","true","66.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Obviously bad news.) Game does allow for saving progress in between "boardings" which is all I wanted.\n\nGame is great. UI is very minimalist which is both evocative of the setting as well as easy to learn. Biggest difficulty I face is my own adrenaline and the impact it has on my abiltity to type the commands necessary to save my poor little drones!  Also, typos which open the wrong doors allowing swarms of evil baddies to kill off drones on the other side of the ship are bad. Losing key abilities because I failed to repair them before they finally failed completely: again, very bad.\n\nThe "plot" in the background of figuring out why all this happened and where everyone went is a minor factor. Would be more interesting if the computers on the ships I visited could reveal more information through "Interface" ability, etc.  (Maybe they do later on in the game???)\n\nDefinitely one of the most fun and immediately enjoyable games I've purchased lately.

You are a salvage ship operator, looting derelict ships using drones and a keyboard-only, command-line interface to control them. You can give them orders to follow or pilot any one drone directly via a top-down view with limited visibility. All commands can be issued from either view during a salvage operation. The general idea is to see how long you can survive.\n\nThere is plenty to do in this is game, but it is relentlessly unforgiving. Expect to get hammered by the RNG a [i[lot[/i] -- sometimes you just plain have bad luck. Making progress is slow and "grindy", even with difficulty options (nice touch!) tweaked toward "easy".  The cost of upgrades, repairs, and/or equipment is high. Often, when you do seem to be making decent progress, a random hazard (of which there are many types) just crushes you so far back into the weeds you might as well have been killed (yes, it's permadeath if you do).\n\nEach derelict can only be visted once. Since each derelict is procedurally generated, its difficulty can vary widely. The game does give you some information (size of the ship, number of different types of enemies, etc.) that helps in general to gauge its difficulty, but sometimes it's best to just grab what you can and run, as the game wisely advises you.\n\nIt's also possible to get stuck while salvaging a ship, not dead but unable to do anything.  In such situations, you can quit and restart at the point before you stared exploring the current ship, but you cannot explore that same ship again.\n\nThis game has a "puzzle" aspect to it as well. It requires a lot of thought and careful planning, and the ability to react quickly and decisively when things go pear-shaped. The game does let you pause to think, but you can't see anything useful while paused.\n\nI expect to be playing this quite a bit. There's a lot to do in the game and it's clearly going to take a while to discover all of it.","June 6","true","28.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
