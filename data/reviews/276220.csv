This game is truly a masterpiece, and I think it's a huge landmark in the history of video gaming. The graphics in this game are way beyond anything that comes out nowadays, and the gameplay is incredible. This really feels like a simulator, and it's so good that sometimes I feel like I can touch the cats and dogs in this game. This game should be sold for way more than £4.79, the developer really deserves it. 10/10, this game is perfect.","April 4, 2014","true","1.0"," 43 of 79 people (54%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","54","43","79","11","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepperonionion/recommended/276220/","pepperonionion","dungus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepperonionion/","682 products in account","There are many games on Steam, but there are few masterpieces. Gaming is one of the biggest markets among kids, teens, adults and even seniors. There are games pouring out each and every day, but there are so many choices. This game is the only choice you should have to make, My Best Friends: Cats & Dogs is a masterpiece. From the second I entered the game, my body tingled with excitement as if it was my 8th Christmas. You're met with the amazing music, so delightful you could've sworn  it was composed by Beethoven. Never have I seen such good graphics, it's as if I was playing it in real life. This game is the definition of immersion. You get the choice of being a boy and girl, and I chose the boy. I got a choice of about 5 entire outfits, it's just like real life. My eyes started tearing as I hit that green "Ok" button to advance forward in what shall soon be known as "GAMING". This game is all you need. I picked the cute brown dog, I got to name it whatever I wanted and it still amazes me to this day how there are so many choices, so much to explore. The possiblities are endless, should I name my dog Henry, or perhaps Sylvia? All I know is that this game has changed my life, before I woke up every day as a boy, but since I have played Cats & Dogs: Best Friends. I have woken as a MAN. This game is not a game, it is an experience, a religious one at that. You get to scrub the dirt off your dog in a bath, you get to feed it a choice of either basic food or oily and healthy food, you get to let it sleep for THREE or SIX hours or even a day! After your dog feels happy, you get to take it outside and suddenly the game turns into a top down perspective, wow! I am amazed! This game does it all! I walked myself over and begun teaching my dog tricks, I taught him to stand, lay down and EVEN ROLL OVER! I was shaking with excitement as my heart pounded. I was delighted. I advanced to "catch", where it turned into a side scroller! WOW! I threw the ball very far and this dog ran vigorously and hard through the dirt and grass and caught that ball, he was tired afterwards though, so we teleported home and went to sleep. As I explored all the activities, I was just amazed. This game must of taken years to develop. This was when I realized that this isn't an experience. It is art.\n\nMy Best Friends: Cats & Dogs is the best game I have ever played, the graphics are beautiful, there is so much immersion, tons of activities and tons of happiness. Games are sometimes re released as "Game of the Year" edition.\n\nThis game needs to be released as\n\nGame of the century.\n\n5 stars.","June 19, 2014","true","0.7"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","11","22","5","3"

The moment I picked the hat of my character I knew this game was going to be great. I began with Giving my dog a bath. The experience was so thrilling I deceided to do it again! At that point I was hooked, I've been grinding my husky the past .1 hours getting it's stats up like crazy. My petting points are out of this world!  I could pet any dog, any cat(If I knew how to get a cat), and the hat I wore just completley sealed the entire process. I'm pretty sure I wont be going back to any other games ever. This is quite possibly I'll ever need\n\n\nVery good game, definitely reccomend\n12/10\n5 stars\nA+\n","November 27, 2014","true","0.1"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","50","12","24","6","2"

I've played a lot of bad animal games that were enjoyable. But this one... It's really bad, even for kids. Hell, it's kind of upsetting how some people think that you can put little to no effort in child's game and still feel fine about it.\n\nThe backgrounds are ugly and motionless. Dogs and cats sometimes just freeze after an animation and stare into the abyss with dead eyes. Gameplay is repetetive and BORING AS HELL. You can unlock some new features, like tricks or places to go to, but they're all not that interesting and they don't change almost anything. For example, you can unlock the forest area and take your pet for a walk, but there's absolutely no point in doing that. There's nothing to do there, nothing to explore or just look at, and your character is painfully slow.\n\nTo sum up, this game is pretty harmless, so if you really want to spend your money on something silly, you can. But you'll be better off saving it for same better animal games. Or, I don't know, a cupcake. Cupcakes are always good.","January 8","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
