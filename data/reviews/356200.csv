(well, the other Keen games at least). Keen is iconic! Keen was the game I first downloaded off the internet, in 1994-95 it took 1 hour to download the 2 or 3MB shareware episode on 33.6kbps dialup at a net cafe. Waste of money essentially but it was 'exciting' to wait 1 hour to download something that otherwise would have had to buy on a shareware disk. Epic platformers, similar to Super Mario 3 with the world map screen (more choices though as it is an open map, unlike the SMB3 map which has rails to move on) but with no 'killing' of enemies. The foodstuffs you fight, you have to throw things at them, they turn to flowers and then respawn a few moments later. If you never played this (or even if did and want a journey down memory lane) - get it! It might look 'crap' to you but imagine your other option in the very early 90s for PC gaming - it was way up there! Similar to: Captain Comic","December 11, 2015","true","4.7"," 41 of 42 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","41","42","2","11"

It falls somewhere between the end of Invasion of the Vorticons and Goodbye Galaxy, so that effectively makes it episode 3.5 or some such nonsense. Since then it’s floated around like a chunk of loose cat hair, with an Android release in 2013 by Super Fighter Team and now this crowd-funded re-release for the PC by Javier Chavez. This includes not only the source code, but an updated port of the game for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS computers. Pretty snazzy in concept -- and in reality!\n\nThis isn’t a complete overhaul or anything, this is just a port with a few extra thingies. Thingies like modern gamepad support, widescreen and windowed mode graphics options, cloud saving, achievements, and even a switch for CGA and EGA mode right from the main menu.\n\nAs for the game itself, well, it’s the same pared-down Keen experience as it was before. The story is that Keen refused to eat his veggies one night, then has nightmares about it where vegetables are torturing him in the land of Tuberia. Dressed in pajamas and armed only with hippy-fied flower power seeds, it’s your goal to collect enough boobus bombs to eventually defeat the giant sentient potato, King Boobus Tuber. Most notably, you don’t have a pogo stick, which puts it up for debate as to whether or not this is even a Keen game at all without his trademark power-up. Some other things are missing as they were in the original DOS release, like any music whatsoever, the ability to look up and down, and grabbing onto ledges while jumping. Disregarding the sparseness of features, the gameplay itself is similar enough to Goodbye Galaxy that it doesn’t completely suck. I had a lot of fun with this as a kid, and I still find it to be a unique challenge, with its non-linear progression and the challenges of using flower power due to the arc you throw the seeds at.\n\nSo while the gameplay itself is as "meh" as ever, this is just awesome if you ask me, because games like this don’t deserve to be forgotten. Even without my own nostalgia for this title, I’m just glad this is getting some attention, because no matter what Level 32 of Doom II says, Keen will never die.","October 8, 2015","true","0.5"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","30","35","4","0"

I really appreciate that the developer here has actually ported this to modern operating systems rather than just dropping it in Dosbox, and it has the pleasant side effect of their being added achievements which are a nice bonus. Proper controller support and trading cards too! The game crashed when I alt-tabbed out of it, but otherwise seems to be well made and faithful to the original. The game itself has aged decently, though the lack of any music leaves it a bit lacking in the sound department. It's not the best Commander Keen game, but it's definitely not the worst either. I'd say this one is definitely worth picking up, and I hope to see more from this developer in the future.

Today the shareware version can still be legally obtained for free from various DOS archive sites.  So if you liked the shareware version, you'll like this too, as it's the same game.\n\nIt does bear mentioning that the same money will get you both the Invasion and Goodbye packs in the Commander Keen series.  If you're a die-hard Keen fan, it's probably worth it.\n\nI originally left a bad review on this game, but that's unfair, and I ultimately do like the game.  I do stand by my opinion that it pales in comparison to the other Keen titles and it doesn't offer much that the original shareware version always has.  But there's potential here.  The developer did take the time and effort to integrate Steam achievements into the game, and also takes the time to communicate with fans.  That goes a long way.","April 30","true","5.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","8"

Long Live ID Software & Apogee.\n\nNow lets get into Keen Dreams.\nThe controls aren't bad, The Jump is a little wide, but once you get the hang of it its not bad.\n\nI like that is gives you choices of where to go next by a map you explore,\nI also like that work like state saves, only problem is it doesn't save on its own so you got to always remember to save.\n\nGame is challenging as you can't kill enemies just temp change them into flowers. Love the fact this company added all these Achievements that is super cool, As well as trading cards. The game is easy and challenging especially at the same time, and especially if your greedy like me trying to get everything.\n\nI thouroughly enjoyed plaiyng this and hope more retro games either come forward or newer games are made in the same style.\nExcellent game!\n","January 20","true","0.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But that doesn't mean it's bad. In fact for a game that was made in only a month, it's actually a really impressive game. If you're a fan of classic dos platformers or Keen games in general, then I would recommend it, even if it doesn't have the pogo stick or raygun that has been a staple part of the series.\n\nThe re-release of Keen Dreams does a really good job with staying true to the original shareware release. However, I do think the price is a little too high for a slightly enhanced shareware game. If it was reduced to about 2 or 3 dollars, then I'd say go for it. Also, it would be nice if there were also some additional content in the game to enhance the overall experience and asking price of 5 dollars, such as an original background music score, some images for the game's story and maybe if possible, a second chapter called Keen Meets the Meats exclusive to this re-release.\nAs for bugs, I haven't really noticed anything during my full playthrough of the game, and the ones I did are mostly on my computer's end rather than the game itself.\nBut anyway, here's hoping for more Softdisk games like the Rescue Rover duogy and the Catacombs series! And if possible, maybe a re-release of Keen 6 perhaps?\n\nHey, a man can dream at least!","January 10","true","3.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is the source of every game after all. I would recommend this game unless it would be soooo hard, that even completing one level is like trying to win a lottery. If you fail at one point you need to start the whole level again, and you can easily lose all of your lives before you finish the half of the game. If you love "some" challenge then feel free to play it. But it's just too hard for me that I can't seem to enjoy it.","December 26, 2015","false","4.5"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","8","15","2","6"

This reason is that I still have the flashing issue. I fied it but then It was a bit shakey. But the developer was very kind and tried his best to fix the issue. And also I ran the game on linux and it worked. I played through it and loved it. It was difficult but I love hard games. The team was very good at remaking this classic lost game.
