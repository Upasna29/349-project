You can buy weapons, get level ups, and get pretty awesome skills. You can also become a zombie when you die (who doesn't?). Honestly...Buy this game.\n\nBut wait! THERE'S MORE! It has challenges for you to do to unlock hats (different heads, YES!), paints, GEMS (do upgrade or downgrade your weapons)...The awesome part? You can go into a dungeon map! AND...They're randomly\ngenerated. Seriously, this game is awesome. But it's very very hard. Recommended played with friends.\n\nHow friends join: First, create a private game. Then, once hosted (your friends have to be ingame of course) you need to Shift-Tab to go to your steam overlay (Enable it if you haven't already), then invite them to your game, or you can ask them to Shift-Tab themselves and right click on YOUR profile picture in the steam overlay, and press Join Game.\n\nAlright that's my review, my name's Melnorme and good luck!","February 28","true","23.7"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","18","21","6","0"

I love the graphics and I really like how things explode into bits when killed or destroyed. The accessories and weapons are all pretty fine and all the weapons are relatively usable as well, which is rare for today's games.\n\nThe developer constantly replies to threads and is always listening to the feedback given in the forums, which is just astoundingly great.\n\nI haven't come across any bugs in this game yet and anything that I think needs to be changed the developer has addressed already and stated he will be doing something about it in his next update. I'd really recommend this game if you even mildly enjoy twin sticks, zombies, or games with online multiplayer and the option for single player as well.\n\n8.5/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Speedette/recommended/263920/","Speedette","BORB","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Speedette/","134 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIt dawned on me that the title of this game isn’t just a fun play on words—if you’ve ever wondered how hordes of zombies would fare inside a blender, then you’re in for a treat!\n\nZombie Grinder plays exactly as it reads—and it’s glorious. Moments after starting any game mode, the ground is painted green, and littered with chunks of flesh, goo, and an assortment of other gross odds and ends.\n\nNo holds barred, there’s an extensive assortment of weaponry at your disposal, all of which offer a satisfying means drop tonnes of zombie chunks. New players are equipped with a pistol and additional weapon pickups are strewn throughout levels, although it’s a lucky dip-esque scenario, which can raise the stakes in stressful situations. Zombie mobs will occasionally drop weapons in the same fashion, too. Otherwise, character level milestones will unlock weapons that become purchasable in a shop accessed via the main menu; these can be equipped for immediate use at the start of any game.\n\nAs well as weapons, cosmetic items are available for purchase in the shop. The range includes: hairstyles, accessories, and colours to dye the aforementioned. These are fun additions, though be weary of durability; nothing lasts forever!\n\nThe number of character customisation and playstyle options may seem overwhelming, but they provide a welcome sense of autonomy. Players can alter their character’s dexterity and abilities via a vast skill tree, accruing skill points to invest upon levelling up. Opting for certain skill pathways will lock you out of others, to prompt roles or specialties (support/damage/and so on); this is especially important for multiplayer sessions, where survivability is reliant on teamwork. Re-rolling your skill points is available at a small cost, thankfully, which offers an incredible level of flexibility (or the means to fix any mistakes from trigger-finger clicking).\n\nZombie Grinder stands out in a market saturated with pixel art titles; a lot of care and time has gone into crafting assets that are very easy on the eyes. It’s especially impressive that nothing seems entirely flat, or flush to a set plane, as can be the case with this art-style. Instead, props, characters, and settings possess a satisfying level of depth with respect to one another. (Noticing and appreciating this is purely pedantic on my part, but it’d be a shame for it to go without recognition all the same.)\n\nA friend recommended buying Zombie Grinder on a whim, as we’ve been searching for multiplayer games worthy of our time and money. Still being in development, I was initially hesitant, but upon purchase and our first play session, I was taken aback by the polish and playability it offered. Surprising still, the game isn’t complete, and yet the standard has been set so high! Ultimately, that’s what compelled me to write this review, as I have nothing but praise for this work-in-development.","November 15, 2015","true","10.2"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Colep7/recommended/263920/","Colep7","Guido Mista","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Colep7/","380 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe little that i played this game it was very enjoyable. Playing muliplayer is deffinetly more fun then single player, but the single player can stand on its own for a while. The game too me seems like it works in bursts because being early access there is not that much content level wise. The "story mode" ( it think it was called that i cant remember) is about4 levels, if im remembering correct, it can be beaten fairly fast. I had the most fun with this game when playing online. I joined a game and was playing with one of the devs which was cool, by the end we had a team of 6 and it was very fun. We ran through the story mode in roughly a half hour. After that i continued to play with this group of guys in some of the other, more random modes. This was the best experince i had playing the game and i would deffinetly recomend it considering its fairly cheap. My biggest issue of the game is just a lack of players overall. These happened to be the only group of people i found when playing that day, and after they were gone and i played afew single player games of dungeon, i decided to quit for the day. That has been the only time i have played the game and in that time i did enjoy it whille it lasted. Im not sure how many regular players there are now, but this game is much more fun with other people. That being said the game is also local which is a bonus.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nNow with all that out of the way i can talk about the gameplay. This game feels very much like zombies ate my neighbors on the snes. It is a game based around surviving through a wave (survival mode) completing objectives and getting to the end (story), or running through a randomly generated dungeon. In the game you can unlock various kinds of new ammo, new weapons, and some cosmetic changes like: Hair, Glasses, Hats, and other things. The weapons are the most important because it can change how the you play. There are a good variety of weapons to chose from. You can have a melee weapon, or a ranged. There is only 3 melee at the moment, being a baseball bat, lightsaber thing, and a sword. The ranged weapons range from suppourt guns, to heal, Normal boring weapons, Grenades, Turrets, and lots of cool things to kill zombies. Currency is very important becuase your weapons have a durability meter, so you may have to rebuy weapons when old ones break. The store is seprate from the game and is acessed through the main menu, so always join a match prepaired. You can only bring one weapon into a game but have various slots and find weapons as you go.  The zombie killing feels very fun and even though you can only aim in 8 directions, opposed to full twinstick movement, it feels very fluid and smooth. Killing zombies is very satisfying as it sends their body parts flying and leaves a mess on the battlefield.\n\nExtra stuff/Final rating.\nA few extra things i feel that need to be mentioned are the graphics and the music. God damn is the title screen music catchy and it may be somthing i will never forget and havent since i purchased this game way back when on Desura. The art style is very distinct and looks great. When i first saw this game show up on steam i instantly knew i had played it before, despite not even touching the game for like a year and a half, but seeing the art and hearing the music in the video made me instantly remember i had played this game on Desura.\n\n\n\nOverall i would give this game a  7.5/10	 (which may change) because of the lack of players i experienced. Everything else about this game was phonomenal and i really enjoyed the little i played of it, seeing that this game is still in early access and has mod suppourt, i see Zombie Grinder being a game I pick up and play alot from time to time want would make a great local multiplayer game when you are hanging out with friends. I wish TwinnDrills the best of luck, and hope Zombie Grinder becomes a hit.","November 3, 2015","true","3.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The enjoyment of basic top-down-twin-stick-arcade-style games like these comes from smooth controls and intuitive, fast paced gameplay, however this game does not deliver.\n\nI played this game with several friends expecting the cooperative nature of the game to dwarf any inadaquacies, yet still by minute one there were some severe complaints.  Specifically, the controls just arent smooth.  All the buttons are just ridiculously out of place - main fire is left trigger, switch weapon isnt y, dash is x, strafe is b... its like they decided to attempt revolutionary button placement.  You can of course remap the buttons, but even at their optimal placement, they will still feel clunky at best.  To run and shoot you'll need to press and hold 3 buttons while constantly tapping the fire button.\nUnfortunately, at least as to the time I made this review, the unpolished glint from this game predominantly overshadows everything I could really enjoy about the game.\n\n3/10 coop experience.\n\n","May 5","false","0.5"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

Originally I bought this game only for selling hats, but the game is really fun to play either yourself or with your friends.\n\nPros:\n+ Nice graphics\n+ Lots of guns\n+ Customizations (Lots of accessories from the game or Steam item drop)\n+ Deep skill tree (Get more SP or max-out the attribute? Your choice)\n+ Catchy soundtrack (especially the menus)\n\nCons:\n- Confirm Pick up items also affects bandages & gem loots (I just want to confirm pick-up weapons, not loots or even bandages, since it will be tedious)\n- Awkward controls (you'll get used to it, but since it plays like twin-stick shooter you'll wish you can play with WASD & mouse)\n- Options are not carried over to offline mode (Save data not carried over: fine, Game options not carried over: what?)\n\nIt's basically what it says on the tin.

I love this game, Im not sure why so many people are disappointed in it. Before I bought it I had writen a post on the forums and the dev got back to me same say I posted to let me know this is a keyboard controlled game. ITS NOT BAD though. Ive played some dreadful keyboard only games and this is not one of those. You can even use your mouse in the menu, and can customize your key bindings to make it more suited for your play style.\nThat being said, the game play is great! Its a great arcade type game you can play with your friends, others, or by yourself. Top down shooter that has great RPG elements. As you level up you can go in and unlock skills  for your character, you can buy stylish dogs for them, I went with kitty ears, and can color them how you like. You can upgrade your guns, ammo, turrets, ect.\nTheres so many types of gameplay you can do as well. The normal arcade play through mode, wave, dungeon crawlers, even in an actual dungeon with traps, ect.\nI took a risk and bought this game unsure if Id like it but its been a great one to play with friends, Several of us got it and have already played it several hours.","May 5","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Theres not much to it expect shoot em all with campaign or other people with a lot of unlockable stuff. Its a nice addition that it has quite a lot of varities of zombies but it doesn't really help when you got a gun that can kill anything on its path. I haven't visited the workshop so I am not sure how great the community is but they seem rather friendly from my gameplay expirience on servers. The game just feels too much of cosmetics and less emphasis on shooting up zombies. I doubt theres not much to add on to its shooting criteria.

Make some aim like or something....Walking slow sucks. Make a run option. Zombie types should be explained before the game starts...maybe in an intro thing...Also, the objectives aren't made clear. I make it to the end of a map, but turns out the game thinks I need to go to a gun shop. Obviously I'm fine without the gun shop if I made it to the end of the level already. Overall, a little annoyed. It's an okay purchase, I just hope they make it better. Also, there should be an open world type thing, be able to enter a building and defend it or something. Or maybe create buildings where you want, enter, and defend those. This is just a game where you walk around and shoot zombies, which gets real boring, real fast. There should also be checkpoints within the levels. Maybe be able to upgrade level things while in-game. Zombies should have tiny health bars above their heads.. All the info that's displayed on the corner is tiny, I don't know when my gun is about to run out of ammo, there should be ammo crates and food on the ground, instead of having to buy it all... Gets repeatitive fast...maybe it's because I got a headache right now...but somehow I feel betrayed by the video, because it seemed better. Cool assests...but all that goes to waste if the game isn't executed in a smooth way..but other than all that...I'd say it's worth it on sale. Which I got it for like $4. But somehow I still feel betrayed.. I wouldn't get the game right now...maybe when the things I mentioned are enhanced, that would be a great purchase, until then, I wouldn't rebuy it.....","May 3","false","2.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","1"

Basicly its a wave survival game, since the campaign is very short and meaningless.  As of right now the game does show some good potential, but there are a few changes the developers need to make before I give this game a positive review.\nThe first problem is that the game is bugged.  The game features a neat weapon leveling system in which the player must find gems to level up their guns.  You can buy guns with the gold that zombies drop and put the gems that you find as a rare drop from zombies in the gun to make it stronger.  I bought a flare gun and maxed it out on gems, which is time consuming.  Well guess what, the flare gun wont reload.  I tried filling it up with an ammo crate, still nothing.  I spammed the reload button over and over again, still nothing.  I didn't think much of it until a few weapons later I tried to do the same thing with a turret.  SUPRISE* I can't use them. All of those gems that I spent hours getting were put to an absolute WASTE. The bug officially trolled me, and the deveolopers of the game are sitting on their lazy asses as this game progresses into nothingness (since only 10 players are actually playing at any given moment).\nThe second problem is that the campaign is mind numbingly boring, short, and lazy.  The campaign features zombies that you can fight in any wave survival round, so the campaign is literally pointless to play.  Upon completing the campaign you notice that you will recieve no special items and pretty much unlock nothing.  There are only three levels to the campaign which is an absolute joke, since there is hardlly any extra content.  The boss you fight at the end is way too easy and is an abomination of lazy graphics.  Wtf is it, a zombie head star fish?  This campaign is a lazy joke.\nThe third problem is the rare items.  You will be playing the game and all of the sudden somone will join your game with a crazy overpowered weapon.  How did they get these weapons?  Well go ahead and ask them and they wont really be able to tell you.  One response I recieved was, "I just woke up one day, logged on, and I had it."  Upon further inspection the game will give you a rare item for no reason on a daily basis.  This means you aren't rewarded for making it far in their randomly generated dungeons, yeah if you get to the 40th level of their dungeon, you still wont find a rare indestructable item.  To get the item you want, you can only sit back and hope that the next day you will recieve it randomly. (BUT IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT YOU WILL JUST RECIEVE A PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥ BUCKET OF NEVER ENDING PAINT OR A TOP HAT) ***this game is trolling me**** FML  The last weapon I recieved was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ grenade with a faster reload speed. x_x  Any respectable loot system would allow these weapons to be found in game, instead its a just a trashy gimick to get players to log on every day.\nUntil the devs read this comment and fix some of these issues.  I am going to vote the game a negative score.  What a mess and a heap of bad descisions.  The content is lazy, so prepare yourself for a game that is half ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\n","March 6","false","76.7"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

It is more for the satirical silly than a hardcore elitist mood.\n\nSo the primary question is: Why Zombie Grinder?\nThere are so many Zombie games, they are a dime a dozen Thousand and some are free (P2W)\n\nFor me it was because of Steam Market Items.\nI actually did not even notice it is early access. As many of the other Zombie games are flagged as glitchy incomplete messes.\n\nZombie Grinder is not a damp and dreary (though I do like damp and dreary aesthetic as my Steam Name implies) Zombie FPS (or graphics focused game) which took on too much that they drowned themselves in glitches and “to do’s”. It does not however look like a 80s to 90s style “I have no idea what those pixels are actually suppose to be”. It has more a clean vectored look. (kids might not know this, but that is how flash animation looked before people outsourced it to Youtube pixelization for copyright purposes). This game should not be 2spooky4you. The only scary things are\nare those damn vampires\n\n\nSure the campaign is short (though they are working on an extension or rework).\n\nThe beauty and survival grind forward or replay-ability is in the other game modes.\n\nPvP. PvP however seems quite one sided (especially factoring in version 1.0.32.62a crafting) and heavily ping dependant. Additionally the population does not seems to be quite large enough yet. And many are currently with good reason shy for it.\n\n\nThey even lately (version 1.0.32.62a) implemented a crafting (weapon upgrade) system.\n\nThe other feature I have not tried or care for, but should note is the workshop potential imbedded.\n\nSo in summery: Fun, light casual for murdering many zombies.

It is more for the satirical silly than a hardcore elitist mood.\n\nSo the primary question is: Why Zombie Grinder?\nThere are so many Zombie games, they are a dime a dozen Thousand and some are free (P2W)\n\nFor me it was because of Steam Market Items.\nI actually did not even notice it is early access. As many of the other Zombie games are flagged as glitchy incomplete messes.\n\nZombie Grinder is not a damp and dreary (though I do like damp and dreary aesthetic as my Steam Name implies) Zombie FPS (or graphics focused game) which took on too much that they drowned themselves in glitches and “to do’s”. It does not however look like a 80s to 90s style “I have no idea what those pixels are actually suppose to be”. It has more a clean vectored look. (kids might not know this, but that is how flash animation looked before people outsourced it to Youtube pixelization for copyright purposes). This game should not be 2spooky4you. The only scary things are\nare those damn vampires\n\n\nSure the campaign is short (though they are working on an extension or rework).\n\nThe beauty and survival grind forward or replay-ability is in the other game modes.\n\nPvP. PvP however seems quite one sided (especially factoring in version 1.0.32.62a crafting) and heavily ping dependant. Additionally the population does not seems to be quite large enough yet. And many are currently with good reason shy for it.\n\n\nThey even lately (version 1.0.32.62a) implemented a crafting (weapon upgrade) system.\n\nThe other feature I have not tried or care for, but should note is the workshop potential imbedded.\n\nSo in summery: Fun, light casual for murdering many zombies. With the potential to pay itself off\n","January 17","true","45.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then there's the long as charcter skill tree and I'm talking about over 50 differrent upgrades!!! With weapon upgrades a little less than chracter uupgrades but still each weapon has it's own upgrade and  there is about thousands of guns to upgrade!!!
