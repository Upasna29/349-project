For a rather decent price, you'll get a hour or two of very nice story, well made backround music with anime styled sprites dubbed by english voice actors.\n\nI will try to avoid all spoilers in these few words I'd like to share about my impressions.\n\nFirst of all, for such a short game, the story is very nice. It has everything from a nice start to a well done climax. The characters are nice. To my suprise even the english dub is nice as the voice actresses are doing much more than just reading a script (although if I hear "Yawnies" again I'll probably go crazy...) I can't find praise for the humour in the game. I really enjoyed it, with all the crappy puns to various other surprises which are very pleasant compared to other indie VN games.\n\nThe main character uses a lot of emoticons in the conversations making them lively and with the humorous replies it makes the main character unique and memorable. Most of them are rather complex so understand the meaning, but there is no shame to look it up, or simply turn them off in the options, which in my opinion shaves a lot of uniqueness from the main character.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants to relax while enjoying a short story with a simple puzzle gameplay and backround music which fits nicely the setting.\n\nAs for gameplay, it is very simple. You simply move with WSAD (heresy to call it ASWD!!! *shakes fist* >:D). You progress the story by clicking on "next" or by simply pressing enter. You can skip some parts with F which is really handy in the higher difficulties.\nThe game offers 3 difficulties. I did play it on the "brutal difficulty designed specially to torture prisoners and for masochists :D" and it was quite enjoyable although there aren't any achievements to unlock.\nWhat I didn't really like is the lack of windowed mode, lack of resolution settings. The steam overlay is a mess, with popups being cut apart and I had trouble making screenshots, which is kinda sad, because I like to take souvenirs.\n\nSumming it up:\nPros: Nice story\nGood price\nGood BGM\nNice, simple and relaxing gameplay\nTrading cards\nFUUUUUSION HA!\nSeveral golden puns and character interactions\nDecent voice acting (Xanthe's voice reminds me of Estelle from Tales of Vesperia. Good stuff).\n\nCons:\nProbably too easy for hardcore puzzle gamers even on the hardest dificulty.\nShort\nLack of achievements\nFullscreen and 1 resolution\nIncompatible with steam overlay + had trouble with screenshots\nFalse promise of Weedy showing using The Mod\n(personal) Yawnies\n\nPs. The character gave birth to the MANly style of speech. Which was hellowa confusing to a non native speaker like me (I know... Sucks to be me, man...). But yeah. MANly... :D\nPPs. I will have nightmares from "Yawnies"","January 10, 2015","true","1.6"," 30 of 37 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","30","37","6","1"

It's a mix between a visual novel and a puzzle game where you go from point A to point B.\n\nUnhack, story is pretty bizarre as well. You play as the unhacker and you have to go through data streams to stop the 5K worm.\n\nThe gameplay is you moving a square through orbs, but you can only place your square on the orbs. There are viruses and lasers that will destroy you on impact.\n\nThere are boss battles where you have to shoot at the AI core to destroy them.\n\nThe visual novel aspect is not really there as you can't choose what to say and there's no decisions to impact the story. So why they advertise the game as a visual novel is beyond me.\n\nThe art style is quite mediocre. I felt that the characters look ridiculous and I can't take them seriously.\n\nThe voice acting is also mediocre and some of it, is just beyond terrible. I can't take some of the characters seriously, just because of the voice acting.\n\nThe game is really short, only around an hour long and there's next to no replay value in this title. So don't expect to replay it after you are finished with the main story.\n\nThe game is also pretty easy and there are difficulty options, if you want a bigger challenge.\n\nOverall Unhack is an okay-ish title. It's not bad, but it's not that good either. It barely get's a positive rating from me, because I enjoyed the gameplay.\n\nFinal Rating:\n6/10 - Okay\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!\n","February 6","true","3.3"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

If you play it on normal, you will find it very relaxing and, if you play it on harder difficulties, you will enjoy the challenge.

Upping the difficulty makes this game a bit more challenging if you're into that, but honestly this game is a tearjerker by the end (Without spoiling anything!) Don't let the simplicity of this game fool you, it's a great story that progresses as you're playing the game and moving around each area. Despite all this, I do find it a very short game and wish there were more features.. Such as a way to view all the CG art that is earned at the end of each episodes and was only SLIGHTLY dissapointed of a lack of a "costume mod" ;)\n\nBut regardless, I've had a lot of fun with this game, great soundtrack, great characters, great story and really felt the emotional bond between the characters by the end of it all.

Regardless of the devs inexperience when putting this title together, as they state it was their first one on steam, the game flows pretty well and isn't too long or drawn out.\n\nSome games you feel they could have just stopped and you would have been happy, or they continue to make insane challenge after insane challenge. That's not the case with Unhack. It feels just about the right length for the type of game that it is.\n\nYou are an unhacker (think Whitehat I suppose?) and your job is to fight the 5K worm and clean it out of systems. As you progress and revel the story that makes up our world, you learn about greed, sure as the description says, but really there is more there in terms of friendship, loyalty and sacrifice.\n\nThe game is very short, to be sure, and because of that, I'm not sure the price is right, but I picked it up in a bundle.\n\nFor the Otaku: No nudies for you, in fact the 'girls' will recognize you for who you are.\nThe artwork is pretty good, and the mix of tech with Anime doesn't clash as one might think originally.\n\nInteresting concept and I'd love to see where the dev will go with this in Unhack 2.\n\nOverall, Unhack is entertaining if short. Worth the hour long play through on Normal, and if you want a challenge, try it on it's other settings.\n\n7/10","April 12","true","5.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ssface/recommended/340800/","ssface","Super Shark Face","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ssface/","284 products in account","I really liked the basic idea of the gameplay, but it was much too easy.  New gameplay mechanics were introduced in each chapter, but none of them were fully explored.  The timing sequences didn't really get any harder from the beginning of the game onwards.  My suggestion would be to add in some puzzling elements to spice it up and make the game longer.  The playtime is definitely too short (about 40 minutes to beat once) when compared to the price.\n\nArt was fine.  It wasn't spectacular, but none of the characters looked super awkward or anything.  I liked the art style of the hacking game better than the character art.\n\nThe story was okay, though it was predictable.  The dialogue was neither good or bad.  The voice acting was okay, but pretty flat.  One thing I did like about was the way the dialogue advanced during the gameplay sequences.  It felt more natural than just having cutscenes all the time, and gave you something interesting to read while playing.\n\nOne final thing is that the lack of a save system is pretty bad.  The only reason it didn't completely ruin the game is that the game is so short that you can beat it in one sitting.  You can choose to load the game at the beginning of each chapter, but the game never tells you what chapter you're on, so you just need to choose chapters at random until you find the right one.  Even just having the load screen show what chapters you've already completed would be a big improvement.","September 23, 2015","false","1.1"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/340800/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Unhack is the sort of pleasant surprise you'd never guess from its simple artwork, seemingly basic mechanics, and emoticon laden dialogue that all make for a fairly poor store page impression.\n\nRest assured it isn't complex, nor does its artwork ever merge into much more than it first appears, but it's carried so well by an infectious charm and its developer's recognition of their limitations and playing them as a strength, that I found myself rather taken aback how much I was enjoying playing through it.\n\nAs an unhacker (which is exactly what it sounds like) you play the part of a security specialist, paired with an AI assistant to hunt down viruses before they can somehow destroy the world. Naturally everything quickly goes entirely out of control, rogue AI and viruses alike running amok, and you're left at the center to try and fix the mess while trying to convince your partner to try your TOTALLY not perverted costume pack (did I mention your character was a pervert? you probably guessed that anyway, though thankfully it never goes beyond a few tame jokes). Sure, it's a predicable, melodramatic, shallow story in a lot of ways, but it's written with this not quite self aware but still firm understanding that the game is going to come off as silly no matter how serious it tries to be, so it knows just how far to go without becoming obnoxiously heavy handed and has a lot of fun with itself in the process.\n\nIt definitely helps a lot that the voice acting (which was unexpected in and of itself) is more than decent, with appropriately chipper voices all around that refrained from the grating tones so often given to AI in media. There aren't a huge amount of emotions needed from the script, but I was legitimately impressed at the cast and couldn't help but find them as endearing and adorable of the lovely artwork they're drawn in (not to mention it has the best yawning sound of anything, ever).\n\nI can't remember actually bursting out laughing at any particular line, but was definitely smiling the whole way through as the cute AI bantered back and forth with a protagonist that's kind of an ♥♥♥ but you love him anyway. It also manages to pull off a very internet feel with its dialogue, with phrases and emotes that will be familiar to anyone that's ever made the poor decision of glancing at a comments section, without coming across as just a writer having trouble disconnecting from their texting habits. I'm sure some will still think it's dumb (for which there's an option to disable emoticons entirely), but it was strangely charming to me and felt natural in this landscape of super hackers and sentient computer programs.\n\nThere's not a whole lot to say about how Unhack actually plays, aside from that it does a fantastic job of not outstaying its welcome. Navigating mazes as a little cube of code is fun while it lasts and new mechanics are introduced regularly enough to give you something new to consider with every level, keeping things simple but engaging and wrapping up in a brief but satisfying hour or thereabouts. Unhack knows what it is, it knows its strengths, and it doesn't lean on any of its weaker points long enough to become tiresome. For the price of a burger and less of my time than I spend looking at pictures of cats on any given day, I doubt I could be anymore happy to have given Unhack a chance.","January 20, 2015","true","1.1"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","15","21","2","0"

If you are interested, just play that first.\n\nIn any event, this game just... underwhelms.  It's basically a visual novel with some basic gameplay thrown in to appease those people who claim that simply reading text "isn't a game", but the problem is that all it does is create a minor obstacle course to slow the player down in between text segments.  Since all you do is use the arrow keys, it basically amounts to being told to push the same couple buttons with some general sense of timing to avoid the bad things, but since you're more focused on the WAITING than the timing, it lacks all the appeal of a rythym game.  It's more like those stealth games where all you do is wait for an immobile guard to just turn a different direction, and where you have no tools at all.\n\nBut this surely leaves the stronger point of the game, the story in the visual novel, right?  Well...\n\nThere's two parts of the plot of the game, the actual unhacking part, and the character drama part.\n\nUnhacking gives you zero sense of actually being the master hacker the characters all seem to think you are.  There isn't any discussion of getting past firewalls, no vulnerability exploitation, at one point, your character is apparently hacking into a computer without even realizing he wasn't invited, because apparently, hacking is so like signing into an instant messenger service that even a pro can't tell the difference. You delete viruses by stepping onto green tiles to fire "blasters".  It's not even presented as an abstraction for actually doing real hacking, the way a lot of games throw in hacking minigames, they're telling you to "defend the core by firing those blasters".\n\nAs for the characters, well, they're undermined by the stilted dialogue.  Weedy has stiff, formal, and frequently awkward English.  The dialogue is written like someone still learning English as a second language.  And oh God, Ms. Debug's catchphrase is the immesurably irritating "Yawnies".\n\nThe plot relies heavily upon being invested in the characters enough that you care when yet more "shocking swerves" you could see coming half the story away are revealed.  The problem is, the dramatic points are so cheesy and predictable that you can't help but roll your eyes and know that everything will be OK at the end, because there's just no way they're selling a really gripping story of loss like this.  Since the story is so short, there's also basically no chance to develop the characters at all outside the first chapter or two, and that's only Weedy and the player character.  You can sum up the characters with just a couple gags or catchphrases they continuously repeat.  (Weedy: Forever declined, A2: It's A-squared!, Debug: Yawnies, Unhacker: costume mod.) The only thing I could remember about A2 beginning to end was just that they apparently just put Hatsune Miku in skimpier clothing for their rival. They aren't even two-dimensional personalities, they're bullet points.\n\nTo be honest, I think it would have been better without the gameplay elements, so that they could have spent more time actually giving this thing a story and setting up a way to actually deliver the drama.  Everything is just the same character portraits in front of purple hexagons with flatly delivered "I will destroy you all," "Oh noes!"-type dialogue, and at least showing some variation in artwork would have done SOMETHING.  The entire "game part" of this game is just a timewaster distraction to pad out an anemic story.  That's... really saying something.","August 16, 2015","false","3.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

Eh, why not.\n\nGameplay consists of guiding a small orange cube through top-down levels representing the insides of computer programs. You travel by means of nodes, so there's no real exploration element, it has more of a puzzle vibe to it.\n\nOn its own this would be boring, you're playing this for the story. The story is that of an unhacker (...the term is never really explained in the game either. I guess a security tech person? Because that's sort of what you do) and his companion AI uncovering a conspiracy where one of the IT security companies is behind the recent influx of worm viruses in an attempt to grow rich off of the fallout.\n\nOf course this AI and the various other AI you encounter all happen to take the shape of cutesie anime girls, yeah one of those games...\nDon't get me wrong, this isn't a full-blown visual novel, you are never given any conversation options or relevant branching paths in the gameplay, you follow a linear story divided over 10 chapters in which you will hit every anime trope and stereotype you can think of.\n\nTechnical execution is very bare, with no way to see which of the 10 chapters you've actually finished so far, leading to some awkward restarts if you click the wrong one from the menu, and there's no sense that you're unlocking anything (most games with this amount of VN content at least have a gallery mode that you unlock when you clear the game...).\n\nYet, here I am recommending this game... so what am I not telling you?\nThis game has heart. It's flawed in its execution, but it never seems to be because the developers did not want to bother.

The art is adequate, nothing remarkable. Unfortunately, the gameplay is glitchy, the completely stock storyline barely registers a pulse in its brief run, the characters are equally one-note, and the voice actors seem like half the time they're not even completely sure what their lines were supposed to mean, with unnatural tonal fluctuations and complete emotional stiffness. The aforementioned acting is possibly the game's most glaring flaw. One actress even manages to mangle the pronounciation of several simple words (in a manner inconsistent with her dialect), including another character's name, after getting it right the very previous time she said it. Repeatedly. Once in the two consecutive sentences. At $4, I think everything about it is too rudimentary - gameplay, art, plot, writing, and acting - to be worthwhile. There are richer, more polished experiences out there for less. It's not a STRONG "no" on the recommendation, at this relatively low price point, but given the choice between a flat yes or no on whether it's worth the money, I'd have to say no.","March 17, 2015","false","1.0"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

There are a few technical issues that may hamper your experience. The game will last under two hours, all told. All those gripes aired though, I can say I did find the game moderately enjoyable.\n\nThe gameplay of Unhack somewhat reminds me of Chip's Challenge, though much simpler, with more of a focus on action than puzzle-solving. There's nothing particularly interesting or challenging about it and it serves mostly as way to pass the time while serving up dialog, though difficulty modes with limited lives exist which change this into a very different experience, where you must play carefully and skillfully or fail the mission. That may or may not be your thing. I was mostly in it for the dialog and so stuck with the normal difficulty.\n\nThe visual novel portion of the self-described "visual novel x puzzle game" is similar to the gameplay portions in that nothing massively original or special ever happens, but nonetheless it's not a bad way to spend a few hours. The jokes are a bit cliche but manage to entertain nonetheless. The plot's pretty generic, but that doesn't matter either. It does a good job doing what it does and doesn't overstay its welcome (in fact it could have stood be just a tad longer). The art's not entirely to my taste, but it's good enough. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the voice acting, and most of the lines in the game have voices (your own character does not).\n\nNow, about those technical issues. The game is built on a web engine that really isn't designed for gaming. It's forced into full-screen mode with no resolution options and no ability to play in windowed mode. There's no Steam overlay support, and consequently no Steam screenshots (barring some nasty workarounds). There are no Steam achievements either. The game doesn't save any information, so it won't show you where you are in the story, and it won't remember any settings you change. The lack of saving may be the reason there's no gallery of the CG's that appear at the end of each chapter, which is a pity because it'd be nice to be able to go back and see those all in one place.\n\nUnhack is not a game without it's flaws, but again, I enjoyed it nonetheless. "Good enough" would be a fair descriptor of it. There's a demo which you should absolutely try if you're interested in the game. It'll let you see how well your computer deals with some of the technical issues and get a feel for game's content yourself. You should be able to figure out if the game's right for you by the end of the second level.","January 19, 2015","true","1.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

With the use of some AIs created by both founders, this battles appear in the way of minigames inside the VN in which you control a small kind of bot as it moves through the networks.\n\nThe story flows around the creation of worms and a way to destroy them before something bad happens, and you will be in charged of that with the help of some AIs.\n\nPros.\n- Story, short but really interesting\n- Drawings: smooth, well done and beautiful\n- Music: precise and according to the scenes\n\nCons.\n- Short: 1 to 2 hours depending on how fast you read and the difficulty level for the minigames\n\nI do recommend to get this game.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

The short length of time it takes to play through the game (2~ hours or so) is a good thing, not because the game isn't fun, but the short playthrough keeps things clicking along and minimizes the "fridge logic" of overthinking the universe's take on AI. The game's story is about the interactions of the characters, and the underlying mechanics of how the actual world works don't bear up to too much examination.\n\nThe voice acting was also cutely done and kind of a surprise for a game at this price point.\n\nThe game is not without its flaws and questionable design choices, of course, including tying dialog steps to literal moves on the puzzle board, which can result in flipping past dialog and having to back up through it if you go 'too fast' or fail to notice that the (unvoiced) viewpoint character 'said' something. It's inconvenient and immersion breaking. Also, the game has no save function, balanced by the fact that you can jump to any chapter - BUT the chapter numbers aren't shown to you during play so if you have to stop for some reason you just have to guess at how far in you were. This isn't exactly game breaking though considering the game can be fully played through in a single evening.\n\nIf you play while being mindful of not tripping yourself over those two problems, though, it's a short, fun little game at a good price.","February 23, 2015","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sure. Worth it's regular price? No.\n\nIt has a reasonable story and a good base for the gameplay. However it does not get to the bottom of the possibilities of the game elements. And also the menu (episode select) was missing information which levels have been cleared.\n\nThe biggest issue is it's playtime (just under an hour, 3 hours for 5 card drops) and replay value (not really). So maybe get it when it is on sale (that is when I might buy the DLC).","January 5","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Still, that's a better dollar/hour rate than going to the movies, so I'm not going to say much else about the length of the game.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, which is kinda nice in this insatance (especially considering it's a simple graphical representation of you being a super white-hat hacker [or, as the game calls it "unhacker"] via a colored square moving along a path)  You use WASD, clicking with your mouse (I do not suggest using the mouse for the "unhacking" bits) or the number pad to control your little square, moving from point A to point B (though you usually stop along at points C F and P along the way) to achieve whatever goal the story put before you during each segment (episode)  Sometimes there are enemies to avoid, sometimes there are traps to avoid.  There are some pickups, and eventually some things you activate to move things along.  Simple in execution, but with enough added as you play to keep it interesting (I was interested enough to blow through in one sitting, so take what you will from that)\n\nThe story is solid enough for what it is.  It's all given through conversations between your character & the various AI's you work with (and their conversations with each other) and all the AI's have full voiceovers, which are pretty nice.  It's a simple story, and I think that works in it's favor here.  The story & gameplay mesh pretty nicely here.  There were a couple little twists here & there, but with how things progressed they weren't terribly suprising.  Not bad, but nothing to write home about.\n\nAs far as the art goes, it's nice.  It sticks to standard VN art with the characters having only a few images during gameplay, with most changes simply being expressions, but that art is clean & seems to fit well with everything else in the game.  After each level you get a screen that somehow relates to what just happened in the story, and they all look well done for a title from such a small group.  I didn't dislike anything that was presented to me on my screen.\n\nThe music works very well as game music.  It never gets overly distracting, fits the mood of the levels well, and is able to go on for a while with a smooth loop that won't suddenly jolt you with a harsh transition.  I will say that the stage cleared music (played while the cleared screen image is up) doesn't always feel right with the story elements of the game.  Not a deal breaker by a long shot, but just me stating my opinion.\n\nAll in all, I'm satisfied with my purchase and will keep an eye out for other stuff from these folks.  It's short enough to play in a single sitting, and interesting enough to keep your interest long enough to achieve that.  I'll probably go back and try a playthrough on the hardest mode in a bit (I only played on Hard, since it was midnight and I had just gotten off of work) but that'll be for another day.","April 29","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I don't think it really ever puzzled me except during the very last mission, so much as it required me to time doing the obvious thing properly, but eh, I still had enough fun with it. It also has some decent voice acting, though I didn't particularly like Weedy's voice as much as the others, which is awkward since she's more or less the main voiced character.\n\nOn the other, the entire game is 40 minutes long and I didn't really feel like it developed itself as a game much at all. It told a complete (if rushing from one plot point to the next at breakneck speed) story, I suppose, so I'm not really criticizing the narrative as much as I ended up feeling that the gameplay part could have used quite a lot more fleshing out.\n\nAll in all, I have to say this one is pretty skippable unless you manage to get it in a bundle or for free or something.","September 7, 2015","false","3.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are room for a lot of things to be redone or looked over. The voice acting however is AMAZING. Which is a shame as the rest falls very short. The graphics are good and the music is nice however…the story is rushed, boring and generic. The costume joke got annoying fast. It really needs a better script and some of the levels and when dialog is played needs to be fixed. I found that while moving through the mazes, I had to pause and go back to read the story, since only the AI are voice acted leading me to only hearing half a conversation.","November 22, 2015","false","0.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

When's the sequel?\n\nUnhack has a very... Unique style of humour. For instance, the MC, you, use emoticons during dialouge. It's quirky and stupid, but really enjoyable for some reason.\n\nAlso, having FULLY VOICED characters (and in english, no less!) really makes the 2 hours of fun all that more enjoyable. Xanthe Huynh, from Sword Art Online even makes an appearance. So if you love her performance, you won't be dissapointed. The gameplay in this is fast, but 'puzzle' really isn't the right term for it. It's a lot like the impossible game (the one you control with the arrow keys, not the musical one) but you jump from point to point instead of free movement. Also, in the last quarter or so of the game, your movement speed is increased and so is your health. But honestly, I reccomend you play on the hardest difficulty, which allows NO DEATHS, simply because the game lacks a little in difficulty. Around the only times I died was when I accidently hit a movement key and went hurling to my death. I still want to see a speedrun of this game, though.\n\nIn summary: It's quick, cheap, funny and all around entertaining. Fun for the whole family. I can't wait to see more from the developers.\n\nWhich puts me back to my first line.\n\n\nSo, when's the sequel?\n\n9/10","January 16, 2015","true","2.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I'm going to offer a /very soft/ recommendation. If the premise interests you, it won't disappoint; it is still rather flawed all the same, with a weak visual novel pigeonholed into a puzzle game which has a lot of good pieces here, but could be fleshed out more.\n\nFor its pricetag and relative experimentation with two genres, it could be a valid purchase for anyone who's a major fan of VNs and puzzles, if you belong to that niche group like I do. Its flaws are apparent for most of the game, but has considerable payoff towards the end. It's very short, even for its posted pricetag.\n\nFundamentally, I feel the VN and the puzzle halves are, for the most part, acting in opposition to each other. To its credit, dialogue usually pipes in while you are in safe places (at which point you may be compelled to sit and listen to the voiceacting or read along). Because the protagonist is unvoiced, you have to split attention between the two parts of the game while puzzling. It feels as if the puzzle rarely has a factor on the plot or interactions of the characters, as the protagonist and the given AI girl are usually bantering with one another. There is one particular moment at the end of the game (avoiding spoilers) where there is a meaningful change in gameplay that supports the plot, and I feel that's enough of a payoff to take from the experience.\n\nAll in all, as an experiment in providing a VN with light gameplay elements, I feel it stumbled, trying to pigeonhole VN elements into a straightforward puzzlegame without recognizing the VN's inherent strengths as a genre. It is difficult to focus on the emotions of the characters when you would rather deal with the puzzles presented to you.\n\nAnother strength of the VN genre is dictated by the strength of its writing, and I do not feel that it is present here. The story lacks worldbuilding and context - there's something to be said about suspension of disbelief, but without proper establishment of setting, you get lost on what is happening, especially with regards to the integration of the digital and real worlds (something that is never attempted to be explained). You never leave the monitor, but real life actions will occur to your protagonist (up to and including time in the slammer). Things generally happen because it has to happen to have a coherent plot.\n\nThe general banter between characters isn't especially interesting, compounded by the fact that the voice acting of the AI universally sounds flat and robotic. It fixates on repeated tired jokes regarding perversion. I didn't get much out of it, and it compounded to a general feeling of going through the motions to get to the end of most levels.\n\nAll the flaws laid bare, the plot is solid, with a good amount of twists even for a short product and a climax that pays off pretty well. It throws in enough variations to the puzzle gameplay to keep things fresh. The background music is solid, the art is passable. There is nothing outright bad about the game, and a lot of what can be considered weak or tacky can be phased out via options.\n\nIt's a nice little time killer for an hour, that's about all that can be said about it.","January 13, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

In my opinion, you have made a game easy and enjoyable. That is hard for some. As well as it has an increased difficulty, the cg in here is good and steam will not allow screenshots. Wonderful artwork, good short storyline, levels are timing, and the dialogues on the way are amusing. I still stand by "I want to see that costume mode". The only other thing I wish was installed was a cg viewer if you beat the game however that is what makes this game replayable. There are stops in between each and it's not bad. At each end of the level and entrance you get dialogue that progresses. However I found this game rather enjoyable. The artists and Voices can be found in credits which I believe was a credible and enjoyable touch. As well as the credits noting another site which is also a great grounds for VNs. I admit this game had me at an even odd idea of buying but if you want a game that's leisure, has some fun moments, and dialogue. Like puzzles or games like the original mario of him jumping over flames to get around. This is for you however you work on nodes, timing, it's all about passing and it's pretty self explanatory. Levels will test you on higher difficulties and limiting lives. The game itself has a nice appeal I just wish you had the option of Full screen or windows mode.

A lot of things in this game feel really cheesy and mediocre though, even with that in mind.  Honestly, it was kind of boring.  It was cheap though, so its to be expected.\n\n\nThe final boss fight was kinda cool, but not worth the playthrough.\n\nThe characters are cliche' and have shallow, if not non-existent, character development.  Characters appearing for the sake of appearing, villians being there solely for being a conflict rather than anything that feels menacing, etc.  Plot is very simple, you'll see pretty much everything from a mile off after the first 5 minutes or so.  Nothing is explained and there is little to no worldbuilding.  Many things just happen for the sake of happening, especially with character and villian appearances.\n\nGameplay is essentially navigating a linear maze dodging obstacles all with timing-gimmicks.  Simple stuff, got kind of boring after the first hour.\n\nVoice-acting was an interesting addition, and I admit I bought into the game because of the premise of amateur voice acting in an indie game.  However, it was too monotone; I never really felt any emotion come out of the characters, it was as if they were just reading the text that appeared on the screen to you.  Nevertheless, I have to give them points for trying.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, the game felt like a poor time filler and I expected more replayability, but I knew what I was buying into.  If you are bored and want something to fill an hour or two, go ahead and get this game.  However, its experience is short lived and forgetable.  There are many other cheap games on steam and ways to fill your time in them.  As such, I do not recommend this title.","June 15, 2015","false","1.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

So here is my review:\nPros:\n- Great mechanics which are as greatly mixed in with the story of the game as they are intuitive\n- This game's music has such a retro feel to it that it takes me way back and I love it!\n- The story while could be better has a great atmosphere to it, voice acting done greatly and some great character avatars\n- Very cheap on Steam so it's worth every penny in my opinion\n\nCons:\n- Very short game (about 90 minutes, I cleared it in one sitting) NOTE: I have also yet to play the DLC\n- The game doesn't have a great way to tell you when your character is talking, in the dialogue box at the bottom of the screen, as he is voiceless and moving quickly through the stages means you may miss some story, although you can go back and read the previous dialogue\n- Steam overly doesn't seem to work for me but thats just me being picky :p\n\nOverall:\nA great game, many reasons to play this game versus the little few reasons not too. If you like puzzle games and anime then this is a great, short, crossover game that is very enjoyable right up until the end, and still cheap in price!\nx----------------x\n||8/10 ~ Not IGN||\nx----------------x","April 21","true","1.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's worth the $2 price, but I'm not so sure about the $4 price. It is very short, but it's really worth it. It took me 2 hours to beat this on hard mode. I'll try the next difficulty sometime. I have yet to play the prequel, but only because I'm literally one cent off from getting it....I need to make an extra penny so i can get it. However, this game was really good. I loved the story. It would have been greater if it was longer and had even tougher puzzles in later levels. But the game is as you see in the screenshots, you are an unhacker and you must maneuver through levels and dodge viruses trying to hurt you. I recommend playing it on a higher difficulty than Normal to get the full experience and difficulty. The majority of the game is easy, but that last boss fight had me annoyed. I'm one who likes to speed through, the last boss...you'll want to be patient on. Also the music was very nice and kept me moving. Now I'll post the issues I had with it....\n\n-Game only runs in 1280x960. I haven't tried using the windowed command in its properties but while it plays in full screen I had black bars on top and bottom that kind of bugged me. Note that my monitor is 1280x1024. Could have used different resolutions.\n-Definitely could have used a windowed option.\n-If you're a multi-tasker and you usually do more than one thing on your computer, such as me when I'm chatting with friends while playing a game, and the game is only full screen, you may come across the issue I had where if you Alt+Tab out of the game and go back into it you'll encounter some serious lagging.\n\nAnd yeah that's about it. I recommend this game, it's full of fun. I don't think it's worth a $4 price considering how short it is with how little content it contains, but if you like games like this you'll love it. I'll rate it a 8/10 because of how short it was and the issues I was having along with no other resolutions, which really doesn't bother me much but it would still be nicer to have it in your full resolution.","June 17, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The dialogue is the main "pro" of the game, but it also acts as its main "con."\n\nThe three AI characters are all voice acted, but the protagonist isn't  This means that while you're progressing through the puzzles, you'll need to look down to read the protagonist's dialogue in order to gain context for what the AI voice actors are saying to you.  This really takes you out of the puzzles in the worst way.  It would have been better if the protagonist had been voice acted as well to create a better flow between the puzzles and story.  WIthout this, you have to tackle to puzzles slower than you would normally in order to experience the full story as well.  This disn't prevent me from having fun with the game, it just stood out as a main issue that could have been prevented.\n\nAll in all, it's still a fun little game that's worth the price if you're looking for a casual one-off experience.","June 20, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Playing the game on easy (which gives you inifinte lives) gives the game a more visual novel appeal, with each character having enough differences to make them stand out. The game however is rather short, with each chapter lasting about 7-15 minutes depending on your skill. Also, recently I have come across an issue where Debug's voice is muffled for some reason unless you're playing with headphones. However this could just be a problem I have. Anyway, like I said the story is rather short and the ending leaves me wishing that there were more chapters or a sequel so I could have a more satisfying ending (not to say that the ending isn't).

It is definitely intended for one sitting (I got 50 mintes of gametime). Though you might feel that a short game is not good, Unhack is actually not bad for its length. Although there are better games available, Unhack is a nice game that can get you a bit emotional.\n\nThe puzzles in the game a bit mediocre, well at least in the beginning. It is extremely basic at the beginning, however, as you progress further into the game, the puzzles become much harder. It is not difficult, and you can easily formulate a plan on how to solve the puzzle and progress further.\n\nThe characters in the game are all voiced by English voice actors. Although it looks like a game from Japan, this was not made there (I believe) and therefore the creators could enter the English-speaking market easily. You get to discover a new world in this game. The voice acting is funny at times, as Miss Debug always says "*Yawnies*". The voice acting is on point.\n\nThe DLC for this game is even shorter than the main game, with only three levels to complete. It shows of a sad story of ACME Security's history, and actually made me feel a little bit emotional for the characters. The gameplay here is basic though, with this focus being on story. If this DLC were to be longer, I would have definitely cried from the sadness.\n\nOverall, an excellent game. And for the price, it's a good game. You should only play this game in one sitting, as you may lose track on which level that you are on. The game is just for the story.\n\nI recommend this game to people who are trying to get into the visual novel market. 8.5/10","November 13, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Personally, I'd buy for the visual novel aspect, more so than the puzzle aspect, as the puzzles are quite simple to complete.","July 13, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game takes place in an office with a "unhacker" (which is kinda stupid because unhacking is just hacking) and his AI named weedy. Throughout this game you see that the levels get more and more difficult while also giving backstory and information about the occuring events within the story. YOU NEED TO TAKE THE GAME SLOW, in this game the dialogue occurs when you move or when there is an intermission or breifing before the mission. It is easy to pass dialogue but all you need to do to revisit the dialogue is to use your mouse and press back on the bottom of the screen. The game has really amusing characters with different personalities and each is a different color (remind anyone of something like that? "cough" power rangers "cough" hundreds of shows with teams "cough") sorry if it seems like I am a hater but I actually loved this game. This game has a lot of replay value and it would be really awesome to try this on harder difficulties. I loved Debugs costume but hated A2, the motherworms and Weedys costumes to be honest, A2 looked kind of like a kitty version of a mortal combat character and the mother worm looked mortal combatesk too. The fact that they made the youngest character look so revealing is really kind of messed up to be honest. I am a gamer who plays for the story and for the game not for animated bady parts and erotic animated clothes and costumes. Weedy's costume though may not be inappropriate like A2's but the skirt looks really stupid because it looks like it is tucked into to something around her waist. Take a look at it and tell me it dosent look like a peice of cloth is folded around her waist in like a belt or something? I did love the twist about you being the creator because at first I thought I was the creator but then when it came up saying the creator created the virus and he was being really greedy and "villany" I thought that I wasnt. It was a great twist and I also want to know why did the AI have injuries? Debug lost an eye and had some wounds and A2 had scrapes and bruises all over her, why would computer AI have human wounds? Also why the hell didnt the creator help them, he designed them and the virus so shouldnt he be able to do more than solve a few puzzles and gawk at them all day? Also why are the three human characters refered to as "the creator", "Mrs.Director", "Unhacker" and "The Cofounder"? I also wanted to say that the voices matched perfectly with the characters but the voices of the voices actors did not change tone at all throughout the game. It was one continous town and I hate to admit it but verytime the sad parts came up I burst out laughing because of the continous tones. I would rate 8/10 because of the clothes and because of the voice acting other than that it was a pretty good game that I would recommend to most of my friends.","December 2, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fortunately the multiple difficulty levels should satisfy everyone (Thankful for Infinite lives on normal since the 2nd level kicked my ♥♥♥ but I got better over time). I like how this is a combination of a hacking themed puzzle game (which timed events feel a bit like platforming of when to cross those dots) and visual novel with interesting characters.","May 1","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
