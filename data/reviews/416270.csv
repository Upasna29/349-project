Guy seems butthurt that he couldn't beat it or something. The trading card feature is working, based off of the fact there's some already out in the market and the fact that I just unlocked one.\n\nSure there's better puzzle games out there, but this is a dollar. That's like going to Taco Bell and saying there is better tacos out there. This game is very, very challenging and if you actually like puzzles and a challenge you should get it.\n\nOriginal:\n\nThis one is actually more challenging than the first, and just as good, if not better.\n\nI can't stress this enough, but this game is worth more than the price of $1, and is definitely worth it at the release discount.\n\nYou're just moving a jiggly cube around to hit other jiggly cubes and get them into a square on the ground, but the actual puzzles are pretty complicated. Simple concept, great design. I recommend getting the first goo cubletes as well.","November 19, 2015","true","6.5"," 34 of 54 people (63%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","63","34","54","8","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dart193/recommended/416270/","dart193","dart193","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dart193/","460 products in account","Being not far into the game as of writing, I pretty much see gameplay from GooCubelets 1 with twists added here and there. Sokoban with an innovative idea made first part quite good. Second part is no exception. While there are some annoyances, which include black cubes that kill you when you come in their 3x3 zone, which could just be replaced by walls and nothing would have changed, and a bit repetitive design of some levels which require you to push several cubes SAME long path, the game is pretty much mind blowing and interesting in the way that various game mechanics make the game very tough until you get the feeling of the fact that you can go onto empty space and then move one more tile without falling and until you actually start planning you movements far in advance.\nFor puzzle lovers - take immediately. For people, who frequently is being stuck in puzzle games - stay away, as there is no undo button and trial and error is unwelcome here.\nAnother thing is game price. I wouls say that the developer put pretty honest price here: its around exacly how much the game offers you: there are 50 levels, which are not long, and the game isnt really tough, but level intensity and really good gameplay make up for it more than enough.","November 19, 2015","true","1.3"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","16","24","2","0"

You frequently have to skirt your cube along an edge, and sometimes it'll fall off mid-roll.  If you have to push another cube from along an edge or across an angled intersection, sometimes the collision will shove the target half a space to the side, which makes it impossible to interact with along that axis.  Stairs are introduced, but they often end up offsetting your cube by a fraction of a grid space.\n\nInk cubes will reset the puzzle if any other cube touches their ink stain.  But they're often placed at non-grid intervals, which makes it nearly impossible to predict their death zone without running into it several times.  This is exacerbated by very large levels, which pan the camera out so far that it becomes difficult to even estimate depth and how close you are to one.\n\nOn top of that, some of the level design is very lazy, forcing you to navigate several cubes one at a time across the exact same obstacle course with little to no variation.\n\nOn the plus side, it's optimized a bit better than the first game.","December 30, 2015","false","0.6"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","16","25","0","0"

This was also present in GooCublets but was only an issue in a handful of the later puzzles.\n\nAnother mechanic they added was black blocks which cause a fail of you touch them but their area of effect is only indicated by small splash marks which makes navigating around them more challenging for no reason as their "hit box" is invisible in places.\n\nMost of the challenge with this game is just dealing with some of the quirky movement physics rather than the actual block placement puzzles.","April 8","false","1.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Still it would perhaps be a nice Game for a Mobile Phone or Tablet, but definitely not for playing on TV.\n\nThe large bright-white Background was changed to bright-blue, unfortunately now the large Area where you move the Boxes(GooCubelets) is bright-white and so it's a real pain and still hurts my Night-Creature-Eyes. I would give it a Neutral Rating, but unfortunately Steam only has Thumb up/down, so by applying the typical round down it's a Thumb down.","January 7","false","3.0"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

It's an improvement over the original, in sound, level design, graphics and tops up on pretty much everything good about the first game.
