Again!\nIf you're looking for a game where you can clumsily run away from a bunch of rebellious toasters, you've found a title you can love in AI: Rampage. From the DOS style graphics to the non-existent soundtrack, you're guaranteed minutes of angry fun that will end with screaming and punching your monitor.\n\nYou can change the bunker you come out of!\n\nThen, once again, you just get blasted regardless. Why? Because there's 9,001 toasters vs. you. You are one guy, with one shot in your laser gun, and you have to make it past all of them to a battery thing to get energy from it so you can have up to (get this) 4 shots!\n\nDid you miss the robot? Sucks for you, because he or 3 of his friends, or all of them at the same time, are about to blast you right in the nutz with their superpowered laser guns.\n\nOh, you can only get shot once, and then you die. If you get shot repeatedly because you can't get out of the bunkers, then you've failed the level. You will do this many times because your little dude is made up of a mix of feathers and marshmallows. You're not even fun to eat after they fry you.\n\nActually, the graphics...\n\nI really like the way the graphics look. I don't know if they're stock, but they don't look like it. Maybe it's just a light obsession with the top-down view, like I've gotten used to it or something. Either way, this seems to be the part of the game where the most care has beent taken to make it presentable. I like the visuals the most, period.\n\nSoundtrack sucks.\n\nThat's all, nothing to write home about.\n\nI recommend it - it's not terrible and I'm entertained enough by DYING A WHOLE LOT to try it again and see if I can just finish a level. It's not the greatest game, but you'll get 2.00 of enjoyment out of it. If you can get it out of a bundle? Even better.\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","January 31","true","0.2"," 26 of 39 people (67%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","67","26","39","11","0"

The game is definitely difficult and I‚Äôm not sure with others but I didn‚Äôt know where to start upon launching it. I had to play a few test levels to get a feel of the game.\n\nPros\nRealistic environment - definitely post-apocalyptic feel\nControls are pretty clear but they take some getting used to\nDifferent vehicles definitely a plus\nRAM utilization minimal\nGame complexity ‚Äì the noise factor as well as the minimal ammo and single life makes the game really challenging\n\nCons\nWould‚Äôve worked with a great backstory and intro\nStart menu and tutorial would‚Äôve been nice\n\nOverall, the game is pretty decent given its price. People who buy the game are still eligible for future updates and there definitely are more given that some levels are showing ‚ÄúWork in Progress‚Äù. It resembles a lot of old school top down survival games that a lot of people are fond of.\n\nI‚Äôm happy enough to have blasted a ton of robots, got hammered several times and charged the laser gun a couple of times. While the achievements are really hard to get, I‚Äôm sure there are a lot of die hards out there up for the challenge.\n\nPS: We got a free copy of this game provided by the developers\n","February 7","true","2.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","8","11","2","0"

I can't recommend while the nuclear wind is still a thing. Basically after 5 minutes of playing nuclear wind comes and you die. The 80s Terminator-esque aesthetic and sound design is done really well. The underlying gameplay should be fun but it is painfully slow. I would have had more fun if the enemies were a little bit scarcer and everything moved a bit faster. Waiting for an enemy to turn around or leave an area is super frustrating.","May 19","false","0.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

Sounds simple enough right? WRONG! These robots are rutheless and can hear you from a good distance away, I recommend doing very little running in this game unless you can fight off the robots who will surround you in no time. Funny enough the game reminds me of terminator a lot, not because of the world setting but some of the models look very similar, now we know where they got their inspiration from!\n\nFull Review:\nhttp://igdsunshinemag.com/Mag/ai-rampage-full-review/","February 3","true","0.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","0"

Still, it does enough things right that it remains enjoyable and true to what is advertised.\n\nHighlights:\n+   AI: As one would hope after reading the game's title*, enemy behavior is on point. Robots chase you aggressively and smartly. Their hearing is acute and they have long sight lines, which are reliably blocked by objects. Pathfinding seems excellent. Passive movement is randomized but controlled. All-around solid AI, no complaints from me here.\n+   STEALTH MECHANICS:  The player v.s. robot speed balance is good, as is the noise level for footsteps and gunshots. Combined with the aforementioned AI, this makes for enjoyable and tactical gameplay overall.\n+   GRAPHICS: Detailed textures and lighting give the "2-D" levels a surprisingly realistic look. Performance seems very smooth and stable as well (although this isn't saying much, since my PC is high-end).\n+   SOUND: The directional sound takes some getting used too, but it really adds to the realism. Wind, aircraft, and stomping robots all sound great and contribute to a nice soundscape/atmosphere**. The game sounds very good in my stereo headphones.\n+   Very high difficulty, generally for good reason (more on this later...)\n+   Player weapon/abilities give the player cool options besides pure hiding/running.\n+   The concept of spawning from bunkers and bringing supplies to them works well.\n+   Movement feels smooth, controls are generally responsive. (more on this later...)\n+   The "human survivor of a robot apocalypse" theme works in the game's favor.\n+   Short loading times: little delay between starting the game and playing.\n+   It's only two dollars!\n\nRoasts:\n-   CONTROLS: Strangely, the WASD controls are linked to the direction you aim. So, depending on which way your character is pointed (determined by the mouse), pressing "w" could make you move down the screen while "a" would make you move right. This is disorienting for a top-down view game and contributes too much to the learning curve.\n-   CONTENT: There are currently*** three levels, each with a day/night version. They are big, and will surely take a long time to complete (I have yet to beat one, despite playing mostly on easy), but the lack of variety may make that achievement less satisfying.\n-   LEVEL DESIGN: First, each level's "border" actually only applies to the player and their visibility. There are robots beyond that border who may enter at random positions and times. This is clearly cheap for the walking robots. Also, the levels themselves have vast open areas and very few hiding spots. Altogether, this makes the current levels unfairly hard on high difficulty, preventing the AI from shining.\n-   It's sometimes hard to tell which objects block line of sight.\n-   The laser gun robot looks too similar to the melee robot.\n-   Wait time for entering the bunker is stupidly long.\n-   Nuclear wind can cause cheap deaths\n-   The robots don't look as good as the environment. (Nitpick)\n-   The splash screens are very ugly.\n\nAnd after all those cons, my review is still a "Recommended". For two dollars, you get stealth gameplay with tactical depth, along with some serious production values. Just don't expect it to be easy to get into, and prepare to retry the same levels a bunch.\n\nNotes:\n* I have no idea why this is subtitled "Rampage". It's kinda misleading, if you think about it.\n** A previous reviewer claimed that the game's sounds infringe on copyrighted materials. I have no way of verifying this, so for review purposes I have assumed that the sounds are used legally.\n*** The main menu implies that there are more levels being worked on by the developer. However, I can't find any evidence of updates since the game's release, so I'm skeptical of this.","April 27","true","1.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I like the game but I want the difficulty to not be so hard and maybe tone it down with how many robots are out at a time, because if you screw up once all the robots will flock to where you were and that sucks when you died right besides the supplies.","April 10","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As someone who has played Contra i have to agree with this. i guess when i play a top down game i would hope its easy to move around but this was not the case so it really confused me.\n\ni also think a tutorial level would be ideal because most people will not understand the concept of the game i didn't really either. maybe with some polish this might be better.","May 28","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
