It's an Artifex Mundi creation, so you couldn't expect anything less than "very nice"; they brought back all the usual aspects from their previous HOGs but this time they also added some different dynamics and minigames that help to enjoy the whole experience in a more... fresh way, let's say.\nI recommend this game to any HOGs lover out there.\nJust a couple of "cons" I want to add to this review just for the sake of fairness:\n- Achievements pop-ups stay too long on the screen (and cover too much of it)\n- STILL a female main character and STILL the usual plot. A little bit of variety wouldn't hurt here.\nNothing terrible, this is a great HOG in my opinion.","June 2","true","4.8"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","0"

This new game is probably one of my favorites thus far.\n\nThe format is familiar to any veterans of the genre: minigames and hidden object scenes, inventory management, etc.  Where I feel it stands out is with some new features, especially an improved inventory that allows more interaction with objects, including combining and rotating objects.  Gone from this game is the mildly irritating "I guess I'll leave this hook here for the next half an hour since I don't have the rope to attach to it yet" situation; instead you're able to grab and combine as you go.  This cuts back on backtracking for earlier objects you couldn't use yet.\n\nGraphically, this game is very pretty, especially for the genre which isn't always known for good-quality visuals (although that's improving with time).  Hidden object scenes are clear and crisp with no pixel hunting necessary.\n\nVoice acting is done quite well in this game, which is a relief to me (and anyone like me who cringes at some of the godawful voicework out there).  I actually enjoyed listening to the dialogue for a change.\n\nThe minigames are varied and not too difficult, but aren't total pushovers either.  There are also the usual little flourishes, like achievements and collectables that add some extra fun (and replayability) to the game if you're a completionist.\n\nOverall, a very good game with an interesting plot concept and well-crafted scenes and gameplay.  I clocked in at 3.5 hours for one playthrough, which is a good length for this type of game (even taking into account my stepping away from the PC for 20 minutes to make lunch).\n\nAbsolutely 100% recommended for any fans of the genre.  I generally wait for these games on sale because I don't usually like the $10 price, but I enjoyed this one so much I think I would happily pay full price.","June 2","true","5.9"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","1"

This is a game that's a lot of fun for the amount of time it lasts, and I feel it's well worth the cost.","June 2","true","5.4"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

The graphics and cut scenes are amazing, and the story, while part of their standard fare, is still engaging. Plus, some of the Steam achievements are challenging, and run into the bonus story, as well, which is also new.\n\nIt's good to see the developers that contribute to AM's catalogue improving their games! The Grim Legends line is probably my favourite of the catalogue, and The Dark City has quickly and definitively become my favourite. Definitely worth your time if you enjoy the HOG genre!","June 3","true","2.6"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YourGibs/recommended/458470/","YourGibs","YourGibs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YourGibs/","417 products in account","Product received for free\n\nFour years ago I played my first Artifex Mundi game called "Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart" and I've been playing their game ever since. The Dark City is the third installment in the popular Grim Legends series and provides a memorable story, interesting characters, and pleasing art style. The background music throughout the game has highs and lows that move with the action. The battle game mechanic with escalating challenge was entertaining to play rather than being repetitive and dull.\n\nI've played (and recorded) over 300 HOPA games and can say that The Dark City delighted me from start to finish. To see this game show up as a new release on Steam is an exciting opportunity for HOPA developers and I appreciate that Artifex Mundi has been pushing hard to make it happen. The Steam version is what you would expect with Steam Achievements and Collector Cards and interwoven with the Steam background program. The missing "Strategy Guide" was not a major disappointment for me as I rarely refer to them but I can see how that would be an issue for some.\n\nCongratulations to Artifex Mundi for another great release!","June 5","true","13.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

The backgrounds, hidden object scenes, the characters all look great! The minigames and puzzles are mostly the same as before, but there are some fresh ideas too.","June 4","true","5.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I love the mix of mini-games in it, this is one the first Artifex Mundi games where I wasn't disappointed that there wasn’t a skip the hidden object puzzles with a mahjong or other puzzle game.

Smooth animation combine with twisted plot had made me wake all night to see through the end. It will be more interesting if the puzzle has education elements, not merely fantasy.","June 5","true","5.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

The reason I give it a neg review is because of the messy French translation. As a French player, it gives me a bad gaming experience, and usually the games from Artifex Mundi have amazing translations.\n\nFor example : in French, you got ''gender'' in the nouns, and with The Dark City translation, they are often switched. Like with Sylvia. She refer to herself as a Male.\n\nFRENCH (Français):\nUn jeu d'objet caché ayant un excellant scénario, de la bonne musique, et des scènes d'objets cachés qui me plaise, mais la traduction française a encore été faite à l'arrache. (C'est frustrant.)\n\nVoici des exemples que j'ai trouvés pendant le tutoriel :\n\n* «Signe» plutôt «d'Indices», dans l'interface de l'utilisateur.\n\n* Un dialogue en anglais : I can't fit. Oh no! It's coming!\nSa traduction en français : Je ne peux adapter. Oh non. A suivre.\n\n* Aussi, dans une traduction fr : «Scène Anddddddd.»\n\n* Un autre dialogue en anglais : Hold your fire!\nSa traduction fr : Tiens ton feu.\n\n* «Issue» plutôt que «Quitter» (le jeu), au menu principal.\n\nJe ne peux donc pas le recommander, à moins d'y jouer en anglais.","June 3","false","4.2"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","18","33","2","6"
