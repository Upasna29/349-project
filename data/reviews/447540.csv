The foundations of a good game are there, but it just falls so flat. Given the nature of these problems, I might pick this game up again if it gets updated to fix these problems.\n\nThe biggest issue is that it's a buggy mess. There's this bizaare glitch where your gun fires when your NOT holding down the fire button. This would be fine, just let go when you want to fire, but it fires at random. There have been huge gaps where the lil' guy wouldn't fire his gun when being swarmed by bats. There is also a bug where if you try to jump while a ladder is underneath you, you will instead hop off the ladder. Given how many ladders there are and how much you need to jump, this is a huge problem.\n\nBy far the worst bug is not being able to pick up the space ship part. You're supposed to press F, but it did nothing. I thought it might be an error with key mapping, so I pressed every single button on the keyboard; I got nothing. (This is how I found out that 9 can be used to jump. Wierd)\n\nAs long as I'm listing bugs, I found an exploit that involves you turning around when facing a wall. Because you move backwards slightly when you do this, you can clip into the wall and shimmy down to the lower level. I thought it was fun.\n\nAside from the bugs, I don't like the text. The maker literally used the logo text for everything. It's unnecessarily hard to read for things like menu text and descriptions. The creator should have toned it down a lot or used a normal font.\n\nAs for *positives,* it's fun to move around and shoot, and it's satisfying to kill enemies. Music's alright, fits well. I like the *prospect* of unlocking new characters, but that's unfortunately not possible with the aforementioned ship part bug not letting me progress.\n\nI would love to play this game as a finished product, but the bugs REALLY need to be ironed out. I hope Charlie Evans reads this, because I'm hoping for a big patch,","March 26","false","0.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","8"

(might be game design or a bug i dont know, annyoing non the less) and most importanly my gun was ALWAYS shooting. i was not pressing anything and yet i was shooting\ni also could not pick up/activate anything.\n\nso in its current state i would not buy it, i bought it because it looked fun, but now im here to al least try to help the dev(s) make this the fun game it can be.\nits fast paste (which i like)\n\nbut overall its a 2/10\n\ni think in its current state it should be called a early accses title. if you press shift+tab (steam overlay) you cant press it agian to go back to the game.","March 29","false","0.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I tried hard. But frankly it's broken from the start.\n\nThe game has great potential but that's it. I don't know if anyone else has this but there are two EXTREMELY annoying glitches.\n\nFirst of all, your gun never stops firing. Ever. Bullets fly around the screen and you can't see anything. It's hard to dodge enemies when you have constant recoil and your screen is covered in bullets.\n\nOh yeah, and before we go to the next glitch, recoil! Your gun is apparently so strong that your character slowly moves back the whole time you're shooting. If I had the option to stop shooting, this wouldn't be a problem. But because the gun is always shooting, I'm pushed away from things I try to jump to! It's not a huge problem but if you land on the edge of a platform you can expect to fall off. Or if you go AFK on a platform you can expect to come back only to see that your cosmonaut has been killed by aliens who were waiting for you under said platform.\n\nNow on to the second glitch. There's also a game breaking glitch on the very first level! You're supposed to pick up a ship part by pressing the 'F' key. You can press that 'F' key a thousand times and nothing will ever happen. Just fixing these two glitches alone would probably make me recommend this game.\n\nMaybe this is just nitpicking, but the visuals aren't great either. Lightning in the background of the first round causes the whole background to go white, making enemies almost impossible to see. And the default character is a man in a white space suit! I found myself playing the bandit a lot more than the actual cosmonaut because of this and just how the bandit is super OP. Along with that, you have to deal with the title text font on all the menus and any ingame text. It makes everything hard to read. Also, as mentioned earlier, the bullets are massive and cover up everything in your line of sight. It makes for a very tough time trying to just see the enemies, let alone kill them.\n\nNow, the game isn't all bad. There are some great ideas that would probably be really fun if I could get past the first level. It has a character unlocking system, which sounds amazing, but sadly I don't know much about it because of glitches. I only ever got one extra character which I'm assuming I got because I killed a certain amount of enemies. Also, apparently characters have a secondary shot. For example, the basic character has a grenade launcher along with his AK-47. The only problem is I can't seem to get it to work! You're supposedly able to fire your primary weapon with 'Z' and your secondary with 'X'. 'X', much like 'Z', instead simply stops your character from firing his gun on certain characters. If this was fixed up I think it would be a lot more fun.\n\nBut don't forget, this game is so glitchy that even it's glitches are glitchy! You remember how your character keeps firing unless you hold 'Z' or 'X'? Well, the one character that's actually unlockable because he can be unlocked on the first level can't stop firing at all! The default cosmonaut can stop firing if you hold one of the two previously mentioned keys, but the bandit? He fires relentlessly no matter what keys you hold. At least the default cosmonaut had a quick fix for the glitch, but the bandit? Nothing. Not even gonna put a band-aid on a broken arm?\n\nIt has all the potential of a great game, but it isn't done. Even a beta tag or something on the main page would be enough to give it redeeming quality.  It's not worth the 5 dollars (or 7 after the sale) that you need to pay to play it. If they fixed the bugs, then yeah, I would say go for it and buy it! But as it stands, it isn't worth it.\n\nDespite all this, I don't think the creator should give up on it just because of a few negative reviews. The game has an amazing potential and if the game were more like the video that's shown on the main page, it would be very much worth that money I paid for it. Keep working on it, put up an early access title, it'll all be fine eventually.","March 29","false","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
