I was thinking things like.... more games need to do this... holy crap this is cool....wow, game of the year ideas... and other impressed-sounding taglines... etc\n\nGreat story setup, graphics are nice and the overall atmosphere etc is great. This game had me so excited at some points, but I guess somewhere at the back of my mind was the low pricetag and the assumption it was all going to end too soon, and I guess for me it did. I don't mean 'it was short, and Í am not happy with short games'. Thats not me. Short is good if its complete. A game could be 100 hours long and be too short if the story needed 150 to play out. What I mean is it just sorta stops right as you are really getting into it.\n\nAlso - I really disliked the block puzzles sections. Really disliked being forced to do them, and really disliked doing them. It just felt like filler for a game that knew it was already too short. Like the short kid wearing platform shoes and not thinking anyone would notice, but I noticed. I give this section 2 thumbs down. Really detracted from the immersion and the story. I get that they werer part of the story, but they didnt need to be part of the game narrative itself.\n\nI would hands down recommend this game for the 13 dollars worth that you get, they have done some very cool things here; but would also warn that you will wish you had spent 20, maybe 40, if it meant it had the rest of the story fleshed out or more juicy information. It feels like I just bought a cool sci-fi book from a second hand bookstore only to find out the last 3 chapters are missing and someone put a post-it note saying 'its all good' and a picture of fireworks there to replace it. Play it, maybe what I am trying to say will make sense, maybe it wont. Perhaps you will race here after playing to write yet another 100% positive review, we need about 50000 more of those. I just feel people might want to know the downs, even if it is only 13 dollars.\n\nThe trouble I have is it just felt like they ran out of money or ideas and without spoiling anything, I was left feeling unsatisfied in a big way. For a game to reach so many highs to fall flat on its face was for the biggest twist of all.\n\nIts hard to be this blown away by something and at the same time so utterly disapppointed.\nTHEY DID SO MANY COOL THINGS THOUGH. There I said it. So cool on so many levels. But....come on... what happened?\n\nI give this 1 thumb up 1 thumb down.","July 25, 2015","true","6.2"," 175 of 193 people (91%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","91","175","193","11","2"

Heck, given the option, I'd give it a neutral recommendation. But we don't have that, we need to pick either a thumbs up icon, or a thumbs down icon, and as much as it pains me to do so, I went with the one pointing downward.\n\nAllow me to explain why.\n\nFirst, I was really excited about it - the premise looked solid - this is what sold me on the game in the first place. "Androids" with eyes displayed for emotions? Awesome! A futuristic yet retro tram? Yes please!\n\nAnd you know what? That premise IS in fact in the game. It's a great combination of new and old, wrapped in very pretty visuals (even if there are a few technical hiccups, but these can overlooked). The story starts off on the confusing side, then gets interesting, and then...\n\nWell, then comes the kicker.\n\nIt then ends. I've played, and finished, the game in 5 hours - and that's including that at one point I think I left the game on to get myself some tea and chat with my girlfriend.\n\nDon't get me wrong - I don't mind short games when they offer a complete experience. Like, say, Thomas Was Alone. But Cradle just kind of ends - it feels like it ends right in the middle of something far greater. What's even more frustrating is that it ends with the words "I'll explain everything" and then does the exact opposite (a short video during the credits places even more questions). If the answers are buried in the piles of randomly discarded newspaper clippings in the game world, then that's not a fun way to tell a story. :/\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed the journey, but the sudden end left me angry and dissapointed and with that, I sadly cannot recommend the game. Perhaps if it were a lot cheaper*?\n\n*- No, I don't mean free! ~50% off, and while I would still dislike the sudden ending, I wouldn't feel as cheated on the length.","July 25, 2015","false","5.2"," 356 of 457 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","356","457","3","18"

The lighting, music, dialogue - everything is perfectly honed to create a sense of eerie sadness and mystery.  I personally loved the slower pace of the game, it was fun for me to try to uncover information as to what has happened in this world.\n\nThe mini games were ok, a little tedious and you can skip them if you fail with no repercussions on the storyline.\n\nKeen Stalker fans will recognize some similar themes here, experiments on conciousness and contaminated zones, you can see the loose influence the Stalker franchise has had here, having some ex-Stalker devs working on it.\n\nThe ending may seem abrupt but if you pay attention to the dialogue throughout, and the clues scattered around your home, it makes more sense than if you skip through a lot of the details.\n\nThis game was right up my street but if you prefer more action orientated games it may not be for you.","September 20, 2015","true","9.9"," 89 of 95 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","89","95","2","0"

Several critical issues really annoyed me while playing the game.\n\nThe game is presented as having an open world. The reality is there are two buildings; the rest of the area is barren with an occasional to object to look at.\n\nYou can't . . . can not, save your game when you wish. There is a checkpoint system for the story. At least you can load a specific moment in the story.\n\nThe mini-games I found frustrating. With the limited FOV ( not changeable ) I kept falling and having to restart. Maybe I was just crap at the game, but the game movement was difficult to land accurately.\n\nThe game advertises a high level of interactivity, which is true, but only applies to the hut you start in. After spending a good hour reading and opening things, you never get that freedom back again.\n\nThe game ends pretty abrupt, relying on a short FMV, and taking you out of the game.\n\nSad that I can't recommend it, as the writing and technological concepts are brilliant. When I was reading, and listening to a particular "M-Body" I was enjoying the game, but maybe that kind of experience would be better served in a book.","August 6, 2015","false","6.5"," 149 of 188 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","149","188","0","2"

It is extremely atmospheric and very frustrating. The game doesn't tell you anything and you can interact with pretty much everything. It took me an hour to do the first quest which can be done in 5 minutes if you know where to look.\n\nI received the game weeks ago so I'm a bit surprised it is only 13€ albeit it has little to no replay value since the quests are always the same. You can expect to beat the game in less than 10 hours if you're completely clueless, probably around 4 hours in the second playthrough.\n\nThe main voice actor is a bit stiff and I don't like him but overall the game is definitely for anyone who wants to experience a strange and beautiful world.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BTqE4NEyZA","July 24, 2015","true","9.0"," 92 of 117 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","92","117","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wahtzy/recommended/361550/","Wahtzy","Wahtzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wahtzy/","764 products in account","Let me start by saying that it really pains me to rate this game down, and that if I could I would have given this game a neutral rating. But in the end I have to choose a side, and I’m sorry but I have to go with negative, let me explain why.\n\nCradle is a first person exploration and adventure game, I would probably describe it as a first person point and click, because the gameplay basically consists of clicking at things, picking things up, using things on other things, and rarely combining items. You have a limited inventory, for brief storage of key items, and it serves its purpose nicely. Going along the story you’ll have to play some minigames, which felt very out of place, and basically consisted of one simple and easy game repeated four times. These minigames were reasonably enjoyable, but felt like they were there merely as filler content in a short game. I feel like the gameplay is one of the games weak sides, of which it has a couple, but it wasn’t bad, just not good.\n\nAs for the story, I was pretty disappointed. The game takes place in a very well built world, but doesn’t utilize much of it, and delivers a story which was short and ended abruptly, without giving answers to many of the questions asked. I mean it literally ended with the sentence “I will explain everything” *credits roll*. *SPOILERS* At first it start out with a classic trope: you play a guy that has lost his memories, ‘who am I?’ But it slowly changes direction into something about terrorism, but not, and then it turns into ‘who is this girl I have sitting on my counter’. I felt like the story went all over the place, without really explaining anything. Don’t get me wrong I enjoy stories where you have to think for yourself, but this felt like the developers started a story they couldn’t quite finish, and therefore ended it prematurely.\n\nTechnically the game wasn’t good either, as it didn’t run well on my pc (you can check my specs on my profile, but I use a GTX 780), I did have the graphical settings maxed out though, but even then the game didn’t look fantastic, with subpar texture and model quality, and a problem with aliasing. The game was definitely playable, but the framerate would often drop to 30 FPS. On the other hand the whole gameworld was handled in a single world, and therefore there was no loading screens when moving from area to area, there would however be loading screens when starting a minigame, or going to a new chapter, and the loading time wasn’t brilliant.\n\nI liked the sound design, and the soundtrack is good. I am listening to it as I am writing this. Cradle does feature voice acting, but the main characters acting is wooden, and not great. Ida’s voices are pretty good, and Tabaha’s are not as good, but good enough.\n\nNow, the art is this games absolute strong point, and definitely what sold me the game in the first place. I have actually followed this game for years, because the art intrigued from the first moment. And I must say, the best reason to buy this game, would be as a piece of art, because boy is the designs beautiful. Set in a futuristic Mongolian wasteland, the interesting stuff is pretty sparse, but the designs more than makes up for it. The little yurt where you start the game, uses very beautiful Mongolian designs, and I am particularly a fan of the boots you’ll find in a chest later in the game. When venturing out of the yurt, you will come find a giant dome, which apparently is an entertainment park. This dome is more futuristic, but at the same time run down and overgrown. I will put some screenshots on my profile.\n\nOverall I decided that I can’t recommend the game to the price, as it simply falls short as a game. You might be interested in it though as first person exploration games aren’t particularly common. If you are interested in the art however, this has some of the best I have seen in a long time, and I might play through the game once more just to look at stuff again. I bought the deluxe edition, but the art book isn’t worth the extra, so only get the deluxe if you want the soundtrack, which incidentally is pretty good.\n\nTLDR; this game is a piece of art, don’t buy it if you are looking for interesting gameplay or a good story, you will be disappointed. If I could frame this game and hang it on the wall, that would be the perfect use for this game, and as a piece of art, it is worth it in my opinion.","July 28, 2015","false","4.6"," 107 of 146 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","107","146","0","4"

It's not like they couldn't have made it more open, its just not that kind of a game.\n\nInstead this is a point and click adventure centered around the idea of waking up inside a tent with amneisa next to a non-functional android and being required to piece together your memories and her body by solving puzzles, riddles and mini-games. Whether or not you like this game will depend strongly on whether or not you can appreciate story driven "investigating" and first-person puzzle games, I personally was able to get into both and really enjoyed this game.\n\nThe story is really where this game shines, I love cyberpunk, psychological mystery type stuff and this story really covers a lot of ground.\n\nThe only downside I find is that the ending feels .. unfinished. Yea, its one of "those" .. where its supposed to have you come up with the answers yourself but instead looks like they ran out of time and had to ship the game without an ending.\n\nHowever, the journey, the story and the adventuring and the puzzling were all enjoyable for me and I recommend this game to anyone who likes point-and-click adventure games.

Maybe not? But just in case, I'm going to mention a few things that might make you like "Ooh, there's a cyborg vase!? Darn, I wish I could have figured that out all on my own...."  Well, not really, but you get the point. Read at your own risk.  Most of you are probably reading this after making the purchase anyway.  For those of you who want to be surprised, go ahead and buy the game, especially if it's on-sale!\n\nFirst off, I enjoyed a lot of things about this game:\n\n1) The "open world" (which is pretty much just two locations, some frustrating virtual reality mini-games, and a secret horse a few miles away) feels really nice.  Someone obviously took a lot of time to design the world, and its inhabitants.\n\n2) I enjoyed talking to the sexy cyborg vase.  It was fun interacting with her in the various ways afforded. I'm being vague because I want to avoid spoilers here.  She's one of the best parts of the game, and I wish they'd spent more time expanding her role.\n\n3) The cool Golden Eagle.  It's awesome!  It makes cool sounds, and looks really eagle-y!  I do wish, again, they'd expanded its role in the world.\n\n4) When you take the time to explore, you find a lot of text hidden all over the place.  Scattered - sometimes annoyingly - in the oddest of places.  Some of the text is short, teasing, while others are a little longer, with additional information.  If you take the time to read all of the text in the game, you'll know a heck of a lot more about the world, which I think is a good thing.\n\n5) The story!  I have to say the story is excellent, and it unfolds at just the right pace IF...the mini-games weren't slam-jammed right in the middle of the story.  Which, unfortunately, they are.\n\nLet's talk about why I clicked that I do not recommend this game.  Why I -sadly- do not recommend this game. I wish more people would play it, but I think they'd just get frustrated with the stuff I'm going to write below.  Make your own decision, of course, but be forewarned:\n\n1) The mini-games are too-challenging and don't fit the pace of (what I hope and believe to be) the central core of this wonderful game: its story and the world.  Yes, you can say that the mini-games serve a role in both the game itself, and the mythos of the world and story, but really, all of the mini-games are basically just a single, really tough, TIMED (OMGOMGOMG), 3D platforming thing that gave me a headache.  True, the mini-games change a bit - a color here, a bad-guy-response there - but at the mini-games' core, they're just annoying and ruin the game/story for me, and apparently a lot of other people too.\n\n2) Had the developers realized that the mini-games were a terrible idea, they might have taken the time spent developing these mini-games and focused that time, attention, money on the rest of the game - filling out the "open world" which feels essentially empty aside from the two main locations.  The mini-games are not really a location - they're just a claustrophobic panic attack waiting to happen for some people.  But yes, I would have preferred all of that energy applied to revealing more of the back-story and present-day situation.  You can figure out some of it, but there are some gaping holes in the way the world/plot/story was revealed, leaving a lot of folks feeling unsatisfied and confused at the end of the game.  I hope someday there's a sequel within this same universe that explains a little more, but I fear there won't be, or it will simply be like reading bad Harry Potter fan fiction or, worse, Twilight slash story. This leads to the second bad thing: the best part of the game is WAY too short.  It should be longer.  We should see more. We don't, and that's sad.\n\n3) Based on the two items above, I have to say that the game is overpriced.  It's worth, like, $4.99 or maybe $9.99 but anything over $10 and I just feel ripped off.  True, I did buy the Deluxe Edition, so I paid a little more, but it still feels like I overpaid. I'm sure there's some "magic number" for what a game like this costs to develop, and how much it needs to sell for in order for the game to make a profit, but if you look at the maddening mini-games as half the experience, I feel like I deserve half a refund for this game.\n\nAnyway....  I'd like to see more people play this game, and say "Oh, no, the mini-games aren't so bad. You just have to do this, or that...." But frankly, I don't have time to master a 3D platforming game, when I bought into a 3D Walking Simulator.\n\nI think the only way I would begrudgingly give this a "Recommended" is if they A) reduced the price of the game to below $9.99 and B) either eliminated the mini-games altogether, or made them easier.  The mini-game pacing is frenetic and being forced to play through them - even with the option to "skip" them after failing - heart-sinkingly annoying.  Maybe remove the monsters, or allow for a "difficulty level" that makes the games so easy, a child could play it.  Or rather, so easy an adult can play it.  When I heard "mini-game" I thought something simple, like an in-game puzzle game, or whatever.  But no, there's this whole 3D virtual world that I have to QUICKLY interact with, avoid the lava, and oh no, there's a monster that's going to ruin my day in super annoying ways.  Skipping the games feels empty, but the alternative (actually playing them) is worse – much, much worse.\n\nHaving said all that, I hope this company makes more games, better games, and takes the time to listen to the customers' consensus and...tweak things a little for the next round.  I'm sure the next one could be awesome.  But please, re-think this mini-game format.\n\nHope this helps!","October 21, 2015","false","30.9"," 82 of 119 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","82","119","5","2"

This is another one of those slightly ambiguous get as much out of the story as you put into it kinda of narrative experiences. So saying anything specific is full on spoiler territory and honestly one of the best features about this game is the way its told. The way the world feels real and actually lived in.\n\nLet me start by saying I absolutely hate reading things in games. Not in real life but in games it always feels contrived, forced as if they could think of no other way of communicating the idea. It does not feel that way in Cradle.\n\nIn Cradle, there are newspaper articles that are stuck to the insides of cabinets, buried under clothes or old cooking utensils. And you can read all of them. The strange part was, I actually wanted to. It gives you just enough information each time that you want to click on everything to try to piece together one more string or on going theory as to the nature of the world as it is.\n\nYour character has amnesia.. this is never really explained which is slightly disappointing not only because its cliche and a narrative explanation would be great but because everything else in the world is explained. The only reason I could come up with for the character to have amnesia is a conceit for why he needs to ask and explore so many things. A story telling mechanic. Now at this point you're probably aware you speak to robots in the game. I won't reveal the nature of them in game but their eyes are actual video of a real humans. AND to top it off this is actually explained narratively within the games lore and it totally fits. Not only does it add incredible interesting visuals to the world its actually there for a reason.\n\nNow for the parts I didn't care for, There is a mini game in which you collect blocks and throw them into a tube of light to collect them. Its fine. You do this multiple times however and one of them is a little much. Its more frustrating than not. However I did find through this you can skip the mini games. I only skipped the one but some part of me is sad I didn't rise to the occasion and prevail. I thought about it later and realized that's not what I came here for anyways and not being frustrated was much more of a desired outcome. I wanted to know more about the world. As I stated previously this mini games existence is not just fodder for your fingers to increase play through time. It is also explained within the lore.\n\nI will state however the ending does not give all the answers and leaves you to interpret details and is arguably better for leaving those details for you to ponder afterward.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=492508868","August 6, 2015","true","4.3"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","33","42","2","0"

Reminiscent of moments like stepping outside the Vault. Powered by the underused Unigine the visuals are second to none. Not sure if the soundtrack is orchestral but some of it sounds that way and is wonderful. Made by Ukrainians I can happily say both the voice work and dialog is top notch. Gamepad is not supported and keyboard controls can't be remapped but most of the game is based on visual interaction and combinations of items which was all rather intuitive.\n\nMore a first impressions and will likely update later. Just wanted to say what an amazing game this is! Price is probably on the lower side due to the length not the quality, if you decide to take the beeline approach I've heard it could be finished in around 5-10hours. With so many little details on notes and photos around the world to discover it's more about how much you are willing to invest into the the story.  Highly recommend game!

It's really a text-based puzzle game that utilized a gorgeous 3D world to guide you to the next blurb of text. Viewed in that context, the game is fantastic, well worth the money. The setting is pretty cool (the future!) and you go around piecing together the pieces of who you are and wtf happened.\n\nBut if not viewed in that context, the game is set in a tiny world with just a yurt and a "circus"-type place. The voice acting is attrocious—while side characters are passable, I'm surprised the actor for the main character managed to get the job at all. The "cube matching" mini games are also jarring to the setting. And can get annoying, especially after several "I need this part"/"OK, I'll go play the mini game to get it" quests. (side note to haters: they are skippable after the first time you fail them)\n\n\nSo it's all a matter of perspective. Do you want a text-based puzzle game for $14 or do you want to get disappointed because you expected something different.\n\nI recommend you buy this game.","May 3","true","9.0"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

Unfortunately, for me, it failed to live up to the possibilities it sets out. While the world looks really expansive and cool, the entirety of the game takes place at 2 locations (the yurt and the gardens). There's some "exploration", but it's mostly looking for the right marker/object in a very small setting. I was really hoping to have a chance to explore more of the world, but that never happens.\n\nThe story is... contentious, I guess. It seems like there's a cool story in there somewhere, but as someone who read as many of the "ancillary" documents (newspapers, letters, etc.) as I could find, I still couldn't really figure out what was going on with the story. You can find lots of fan theories on the Steam discussion boards, but frankly, I'm at an age where I don't want to have to go onto forums to figure out the story of the game I played. Again, the ideas seem cool, with cloning, time-travel, telepathy, epdiemics, etc. But there are just too many moving parts and, at least for me, they didn't come together at all.\n\nThe puzzles are not very inspired, to say the least. IMO, the best puzzle is probably at the start of the game, when you have to look at various notes to figure out which container contains salt. Other puzzles are really frustrating. The "cube" minigames feel out of place and are made difficult primarily because the controls are not great and it's difficult to know what exactly is going on around you. Similarly, the flower finding puzzle suffers from poor controls and graphical issues (it's easy to drop the magnifying glass and lose it, forcing you to restart). I think the main issue with the puzzles is that they are frequently hampered by the game's physics. It's easy to know what you have to do, but difficult to actually do it (not the sort of thing I enjoy in a puzzle game).\n\nOverall, it's a game with a really cool world and a neat concept that, for me, failed to deliver.","December 23, 2015","false","5.4"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","1"

I had fun with them. Yes, at a couple of points, I wanted to shove my keyboard through my screen, but with determination, I finished them and wound up enjoying them overall.

The other two had a different dynamic, the one that nearly turned my monitor into a keyboard-holder, that really tested my patience. But they were short and there weren't that many of them. I think that was important. If the story relied on them too much, I could have seen them as more of an impediment.\n\nIn any case, if the game looks interesting to you and you're considering it, I very emphatically tell you to go for it.

I want to like it, but at the same time there are a lot of negative points that are making me uncertain.\nCradle isn't a god-awful game, but it's not great either. It is a first-person exploration game set in a unique science-fiction world, with plenty working with and against it:\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\nFirst off, the game, it's graphics and animations are absolutely gorgeous. The environments are beautifully rendered with small caring touches of artistic liberties to give it more of a unique appearance, such as sky formations, texture patterns and plant life. I absolutely love the designs taken, they're subtle but far from invisible and are lovely to look at. Animations are also very well done, especially with the NPC's who look, act and generally feel very lifelike, made even more believable with the outstanding use of emotion-display technology with the eyes, using real "actor eyes" to make the interactions that much more enjoyable.\nSecond: The soundtrack. My god it's wonderful. Fits with the situation and sets up the atmosphere while being easy to listen to.\nThird: The game's world, lore and story. The storyline is immersive and gives depth to the world that is visibly crafted with extra care by the developers, making the world feel immensely larger than the game and creates an opening to what I feel could easily become a unique sci-fi franchise.\n( The setting is a futuristic world where humans have largely been replaced by machines, transferring their conscienceness to what is called an "M-Body" to overcome a global pandemic and preserve the human race. This is quite an intriguing concept and it would be a general shame if the developers never took advantage of this )\nTaking place in future Mongolia, the player also witnesses a pretty convincing union between technological innovations and cultural traditions in the environment. The world feels like a real place where real people live and work with the developers effort being obvious.\n\nTHE BAD:\n\nFirst and foremost, one of Cradle's main selling points is "the story being built around the relations of the protagonist and a mechanical girl". Both the protagonist and the supporting NPC are pretty boring, their relationship hardly goes beyond story exposition and Q&A, and the voice acting for both of them is detached and uninvested. The two always speak in a disinterested monotone (but she's a robot, so it's partially forgivable), and often the interaction ends when the girl suddenly says "whoops lol I'm broken again fix me pls".\nWhich leads me to my next point: The game is repetitive. After talking to the girl for a bit and having her spew story exposition and lore like a fountain of uninterested monotone, you have to set out to a nearby park to collect a new part to keep her operational and repeat the process. To collect these parts you play some minigames, and my god they are so bland. There are only two variants of minigames that you're forced to play several times over the course of the game, and both of them are in essence pretty much the same. The objective is collect 30 colored blocks, work around a hazard and try not to notice the recycled concept. This is made even worse by Cradle's control scheme which isn't suited to this kind of gameplay. The controls are stiff, slow, blocky, sticky and awkward. Making a minigame that is supposed to be simple in it's design become more frustrating than it's worth.\nFinally, the open world is in essence restricted to 3 areas worth seeing. Everything else is barren, uninteresting and not worth the time or effort to sort through. Making the open world mechanic entirely pointless.\n\nSo with all things considered, do I recommend this game? It's tough to say, I'm feeling pretty neutral leaning slightly towards the positive side. The effort put into the world is obvious, but it falls short with boring characters. The map looks beautiful, but is dragged down by the lack of anything worth exploring to see. The storyline is great, and I mean really, really great, but the gameplay is so slow and feels bogged down.\nSo my recommendation? Take it for what it's worth, a possible entry into a great game world filled with a lot of possibilities. I would love to see a franchise grow from this, because it would be a waste of potential if it ended here.","August 10, 2015","true","5.1"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","21","29","0","0"

The world feels unbeleivably fleshed out and detailed for such a short game, and it's practically certain that even the most dedicated completionist won't find all of those little details in a single play through. Normally that would be a good thing, but not so with Cradle. It was a serious disappointment for me.\n\nThe thing is, there's so much information crammed into the world that it becomes overwhelming, and when the ending comes, it comes suddenly and without explanation. The main path through the game reveals so little that it's entirely incomprehesible without a tremendous amount of tedious sifting through newspaper snippets, posters, letters and other bits and bobs. I get the feeling that there's a fantastic story hidden in there somewhere, but discovering it is a punishing experience. You'll want to know more for sure - but you're not going to enjoy trying to figure it out.\n\nSo what about the mechanics of this game? Well... There are two parts. One is searching for a multitude of hidden objects in a world full of clutter (find the TV remote simulator, anyone?) and the other is an oddly out of place mini game involving collecting cubes in a neon virtual reality world. It does tie into the storyline, in a tenuous way, but doesn't really add much to the whole.\n\nPerhaps Cradle is meant for people who feel that working (really) hard for a story makes it all the more rewarding, but to me it felt more like a game which simply never came together properly. It's confusing, lacks polish in its mechanics and doesn't give itself enough time to go anywhere. That's a serious shame, because this is a world which deserves recognition for it's beauty, depth and originality.","May 16","false","5.3"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

You'll end the game with more questions than you started with\n- Some of the turns this game takes and decisions you make just make no sense\n- The voice acting is monotonous and passionless\n\n\nCradle starts out on a very positive note, putting you in some yurt in the middle of the steppe with very beautifully designed interior and lots of objects to interact with. Bits of background information are scattered in the form of newspaper pieces, overall the place looks very "lived in" rather than like an artificial stage. The gynoid you probably know from the trailer is there too and can be partially taken apart but is not functioning yet. For your first puzzle you need to do some detective work and interact with several different objects. So far so good.\nOnce you get to the point where the gynoid is switched on however, the game suddenly turns very linear and any more background information is not earned by looking for clues any more but one-sidedly handed out to you. It turns into a chase for robot body parts one after another where for each one you need to do a cube puzzle mini game which are tedious, frustrating and feel so much out of place that they basically scream in your face the developers' lack of better ideas. Afterwards, the robot just breaks down and you do one last task for which you get absolutely no explanation why you're doing it and somehow you end up sending a text message consisting of a single four digit number back in time to save the world... wonder how and why a number will save the world? Too bad, no answers. All this is located in a vast steppe which is beautiful but apart from just two locations completely and utterly empty. The dialogues are voiced but the actors are at best mediocre, delivering their lines with little to no emotion behind them.\n\nBottom line: without the time-filler puzzles the game boils down to only a few hours of entertainment, while the parts of the story that exist show promise it is half-cooked with as many holes as a Swiss cheese and leaves you sitting with all your questions still unanswered and the turns make little sense. It seems the developers just ran out of good ideas, money, time or all of the above, though that's just speculation. While for the first hour the impression is good, it runs out of steam almost immediately after that and turns out to be one of the emptiest and most stunted games I ever played.

It doesn't hold your hand the way most modern games do (thankfully), but it's not very challenging either.  Most of its puzzles are logical and/or intuitive and generally fairly forgiving.  The virtual minigames were the worst part only because they were tedious.  The art is a little scattered:  the interior of the yurt (where you live) is done very realistically, but the landscape outside (particularly the sky) looks like a fantasy painting, which is a little jarring.  It was like the artists couldn't decide whether they wanted to be realistic or fantastical.  People with OCD might also have difficulties with the fact that if you pick something up, in many cases it's nearly impossible to put it neatly back where it was (eventually, it will fix itself, though).\n\nWhat I really liked about this game, though, were its story, setting, and characters.  You're dropped into this world with no memory of who you are or where you are, so it's very easy to get into the role of the character you're playing, because it allows you to ask basic questions you need to ask to understand things without it being out of character.  If you want just the general gist of things, you'll have to ask lots of questions as you move through the story.  To really understand what's going on, though, you have to take your time and read even seemingly inconsequential things left lying around.  If you don't, when you get to the end, you'll probably just be confused and/or feeling like the ending was abrupt.  On the other hand, if you've paid attention and put enough clues together as you go along, the ending is both absolutely amazing and poetic.","January 6","true","4.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The voices are beautiful, but I'd just have liked a bit more emotion in there.\n- There's a minigame which feels shoved in. It almost completely isolates from the overall setting of the game. It does have a part in the story, and I actually enjoyed it, but most people complain about it, so keep that in mind.\n- I think I'm just too dumb, but I had trouble finding a few things which I needed to progress. I spent more time on those than I'd like to admit.\n- The initial loading time was over a minute long. It's installed on an SSD, my overall setup is lower high-end tier.\n- Some few FPS drops out of the blue, but not for long and not too annoying.\n\nHowever, the game really pulled me in, and I love complex stories you need to think about to make sense out of it. And that is why I recommend it. And that soundtrack, omfg that soundtrack! <3","July 26, 2015","true","5.4"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

It’s not hyperbole when I say it’s one of the best looking games of the year. It’s got a really interesting story that will keep you hooked right up until the end, and though it probably could have done with more of an ending, the journey through the game is one that is well worth taking. While the cube mini-games are a bit meh, there’s luckily not too many of them, and the core gameplay hits that perfect sweet spot of exploration and item based puzzle solving. All in all Cradle is a really good, really well done narrative game that I’d say is definitely worth experiencing.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy first 30 minutes with the game are below for anyone who is interested.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqdvCN_CR1Y\n\nDisclaimer: Game key provided by developers.","July 24, 2015","true","6.6"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","21","33","0","0"

Mostly every item can be grabbed and interacted with...except the axe.  Early on you will come across an axe that you can't pick up.

You can't do something until it's "its" time in the story line.\n- Living Characters: There are only 2 char's to interact with, but i agree, the "video eyes" really give them life (specially on the girl).\n- Deep Story: Totally agree, the story is really engaging! More to the end, sometimes i got a bit bored having to do "another" pavillion to get a part just because i wanted to keep going on story and had to "stop" for that.\n- Varied Gameplay: Disagree. Yes you have the pavillion/cube games aside from the story but gameplay in general is just that... a "Talk with Ida - play the cubes to get the part" loop. You don't have much freedom or alternate paths to play.\n- Exquisite Soundtrack: Truly! The music is superb, it really connects with the game.

Contains An Ugly, Poisonous Sponger.Genre: First Person Single Player Narrative Exploration Game.\nDeveloped & Published by: Flying Cafe for Semianimals\nPlatform: Windows and Linux.\nBusiness Model: Single Purchase + Optional Extras DLC\nCopy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nIt’s a first-person “open-world” narratively driven game. It’s not really a walking simulator as you can go off the beaten path but it’s not really an open world either for reasons I’ll explain later. But suffice to say, the lack of side quests or additional areas to explore make me question the open world label on this game. Set in a futuristic world of what appears to be Earth, the player doesn't know who he is or what's going on. It’s a four hour experience which considering everything it has to offer, is probably more content than I wanted. The player is tasked with solving the mystery of who they are, what this mysterious robot is in their yurt and what’s going on.\n\nGameplay Examination\nThe player starts out in a small yurt-like building that, upon leaving it, reveals a large open plain with a colorful building nearby and some sort of track system. I’m going to start off by saying that I don't agree with Cradle being called an open world game. I mean, you have this big open level that has all of the space in all of this clearly designed content to be an open world game. But when you actually experience the game, you realize it’s nothing more than moving back and forth between a couple of buildings. Sure there are little bits of lore strewn throughout the level and little collectibles to find but you’re not encouraged to locate them (and I didn’t even know that they existed until I looked at the achievements). Exploring this world is problematic. Even when I did, all I found was the same bland landscape with a few minor curiosities here and there. I did go to the edge of the map and I found the invisible wall. Which strangely has you collapsing from being out of breath. I find it curious that they did more than just create an invisible barrier, they actually had a special effect and labored breathing to go along with it. I doubt that many players would go that far. Not when the slow pace of walking/running and lack of incentive really doesn’t encourage the player to go off the beaten path.\n\nNarrative Discussion (Spoilers)\nAfter completing Cradle’s tutorial your character wakes up in a yurt. Who the player is and what's going is unknown due to amnesia. Looking around, you can see a robotic vase, a small kitchen, bed and other living items. The game directs you to create some sort of meal for someone and so you go about doing it. Upon leaving the Yurt, you can take a look around at the open plain you find yourself in the middle of. After doing some fairly uninteresting tasks, you’ll eventually be able to turn on the Robotic vase and the plot starts to move along. However, she too has amnesia. This is where the game’s narrative really starts to lose me. It’s one thing for the main character to not know what’s going on but for the second and seemingly only other character to have amnesia is just a little too convenient. Especially when this character will continually drip feed information relevant to who these two people are and the world around them. As she’s remembering these things, we discover that a plague has been threatening to wipe out the human race. But humans transferred their consciousnesses to robotic bodies until a cure can be found. So, the duo try to salvage parts while looking for answers until she loses power and the ultimate final conclusion.\n\nPC Settings & Optimization\nSettings include a graphics quality slider (I don’t approve), a reasonable selection of resolution options, fullscreen on/off (no borderless windowed), V-sync on/off, field of view slider from 50 to 80, textures low/med/high and antialiasing off to 8x. I can’t find out what kind of AA the game is using. Anisotropic Filtering is missing as well as view distance and a bunch of other graphical settings I expect in similar titles of this genre. Sound and music volume sliders are here but there is no voice slider. Keys can’t be rebound. Xbox controller is supported. Steam controller support isn’t official but it works.\n\nThe optimization for this game is extremely poor. Maintaining a stable 1080p, 60FPS is impossible even after setting everything to low. The graphics, while colorful, do not justify how poorly this game performs. Outside of the major characters, a lot of the world and foliage is very low fidelity. There’s also a number of graphical glitches including clipping and pop-in. It also doesn’t help that a lot of textures, especially in the main yurt, look like glued-on textures. It gets particularly bad if the game is trying to show the amusement park. Audio design is simply ok but not that engaging. For a big open lonely world there isn’t a lot of atmosphere to keep you invested as you travel around. Music is decent if forgettable.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nUltimately, I'm not surprised that I'm not happy with Cradle. I already had suspicions about the game even during its development process that this was a troubled project and the final product shows those issues quite clearly. In it we have an open world title that would be far better suited to a more focused narrative experience. There’s clearly a desire to talk about classism and DNA/eugenics but lacking the subtlety to pull it off gracefully. It’s poorly paced, poorly optimized and ends too abruptly for me to excuse. Exploration is only encouraged through achievements and that’s not good enough. What few game mechanics there are, are nothing more than busy work to pass the time. It’s a game that’s conflicted from the ground up and everything suffers as a result. Had Cradle gone on for more than the 3-4 hour runtime, I definitely wouldn’t have completed it. So, I can’t recommend Cradle.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]","March 12","false","4.9"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The solutions and locations of items aren't obvious, forcing the player to really explore and interact with the environment, and sometimes get creative about item collection. The clues on item location and collection, already scarce, are not heavily detailed. The result is a player must really roam the lands in search of the needed items and then experiment with their surroundings for the desired effects.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/onemezri/recommended/361550/","onemezri","MonkeyBrains","http://steamcommunity.com/id/onemezri/","246 products in account","I saw this game on greenlight 2 years ago.\nI knew then that I would love it.\nAnd I was not wrong.\n\n\nThis is a very short game and I would say that is a strength not a weakness! The controls are very simple and the mechanics are straightforward. I typically get frustrated at mystery/adventure games (despite having played a great deal of them) but I never got stuck in Cradle! This is because of two things: the puzzles are simple (so long as you read the instructions and pay attention to your surroundings) and you can re-read the instructions or hit tab to see your objective. If you haven't achieved your objective for a while, there is what I would call a "non abusive" hint system that reminds you without insulting your intellect or solving the puzzle for you. I think most people who game knows how rare that it. :)\n\nThe mini games are really engaging! They also exist for genuine story reasons and are perfectly at home in the setting - which I have never seen before. They also have simple mechanics ... and if you're not into mini games - there is an option to skip them on fail. You don't miss anything by skipping them.\n\nCradle is a beautiful example of a well done story driven game. And unlike most other story driven games I've played, the narrative NEVER gets in the way of game play! And nothing is out of place in the story or the setting! The dialogue is also well written, my only complaint would be some of the protagonist's lines are a bit flat (in writing and delivery). However the reason for this comes out in the story. I expect that most people get annoyed by his lines because they are unskippable. That did not bother me, however as this is the only game where I never skipped any line of dialogue. Again, this is helped by the game being short and sweet.\n\nI had to play this game twice to understand the ending, and that was a really good thing! Once again, this is helped by the shortness of the game. You have to think about the story, collect and connect the right information and actually pay attention to understand it. It mirrors the complexity of modern life ... and that is the whole game in a nutshell.\n\nSome of the heavier modern life elements are: eternal life, right of identity and individuality, cheap technology but expensive ... everything else, tiny mistakes that change everything and my favourite: our endless obsession with beauty. But it goes further than beauty, it gives many other reasons to obsess over aesthetics. There is also the topic of a childhood disease, created from their genetics and beautifully dark dystopian elements.\n\nIf you don't enjoy this genre, I would highly recommend watching a play through! Games like this are always much deeper when played … but better to experience a game like this in any way then not at all! I suggest watching the first video in a let's play to see if it's your game – since there is a lot you can understand in watching only a few minutes of game play.","July 27, 2015","true","11.2"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

This will hopefully make it easier for people to see what might at least be questionable about the game.\n\nIt's a game with an interesting world and interesting characters, but for the better or worse the story can be confusing and leaves room for interpretation and there is rather little gameplay at the core of this game even with the advertised exploration or by some Steam users falsely tagged "open-world" parts not necessarily filling just what you would expect of that. This is a relatively straightforward explorative adventure that has you fiddle around with one or another physics objects in the world, talk with people as well as play some minigames (each of them is skippable if failed once).\n\nEssentially there are three places for you to go in this game: Your yurt/tent with the female, immobilized android "Ida" inside, the train station and the "amusement park" near it. Sometimes you'll be lead a little astray into the Mongolian steppe but not too far. Straying off on your own will never really yield anything interesting to speak of but only make you realize that you better stay on course to save you the travel time (that's how I at least felt after a few attempts of searching the steppe on my own).\n\nThis leads to the game have you do backtracking. You visit the three beforementioned essential places pretty much constantly in that order back and forth without ever really given any reason to wander elsewhere on your own accord. You are accompanied by some nice ambiant sounds and music or by Ida - if not talking to her in person - giving you more background info via what could've been some sort of radio connection on the park, her person or the events and procedures that surrounded it (without her it would be a pretty damn lonely game, really). But it's still a constant back and forth. At one point I was wondering why my character wouldn't just decide to do all the minigames in the dome in one run rather than go fetching one thing after another from there for Ida again and again. In this dome - even as highly detailed and immersively as it is designed just like the other essential places - you do the pretty much same kind of minigames all the time rather than some genuine exploration, puzzling or adventuring. These minigames fit with what the park is said to be about, but it's still "just" minigames that some may see as an unwelcome distraction. After you've seen the first you basically have seen them all. I found them okay, they were neither too interesting nor hard, but I could have lived without them as well.\n\nWhat redeemed the game for me is the interesting Mongolian steppe setting, the quite nice art/visuals and the good amount of details the essential places have (the steppe itself is rather boring). And, even as few as there are, the characters. You are "Enebish", a native Mongolian who used to live with his late grandfather in the yurt having your big semi-mechanical eagle "Ongots" hunt for hare and yourself "baking"/"digitizing" flowers from the park's vincinity into "phytocopies" and selling them to other folk for their "beautiful" DNA via the merchant "Tabaha" who is travelling the hovering-magnetic "Sky Ring" train line that cuts through the steppe and alongside your yurt.\n\nIda has been in your yurt for a longer while going back to your late grandfather; after using a peculiar machine in it you lose your own memories and set out to get those back as well as help Ida find hers. Eventually you find connections between each other that run deeper than expected and hope to fix some things that have happened. You two form something of a bond, at least I liked and felt for Ida. I did care about her and her past and wanted to know more about her and the world around me, even if the time with her is rather short because the game is just that if you cut the minigames, the back and forth and the possible occasional desperate searches inside your yurt for items that are at best vaguely described in your brief "goal" log and at worst hidden by design or by you tossing them around carelessly in dark corners even the sharpest eyes may miss (I looked up video walkthroughs a few times). I liked to listen to Ida's explanations and voice actress and felt the pain she suffered in her android body, while Enebish is voiced in a monotonous and highly uninteresting manner (which apparently was intended by the devs, there are possible explanations to this story-wise but that's speculative and I can't go deeper without spoiling too much).\n\nThere are some very interesting things about the world, there are quite a lot of scientific details and hiccups to like or be irritated about depending on your own stance to this kind of sci-fi "fanservice"/mumble jumble. Through parts of it the actual struggles and pain of a post-apocalyptic society and their people are shining through, even to someone like you who has been living isolated from the rest of the world for as long as he can think. For the better or worse some important details are delivered only through tiny, unremarkable bits of paper scattered messily throughout your yurt that even at better graphical settings are rather low-res and can easily be missed because they are usually not modeled by themselves but part of the  textures of the other assets albeit differently colored. Similarly there are "magical" or "esoteric" elements that surround yourself and the events in the steppe and apparently some Buddhistic symbolism one will have, or can try to, wrap his own mind around, perhaps with the help of the relatively engaged discussions here on Steam. These can help to understand the ending as well, which can feel abrupt and depending on the amount of research you did in your yurt confusing as well.\n\nSo, even with the little gameplay value Cradle has: You can think, wonder and discuss quite a lot about it and some people apparently have already done multiple playthroughs (and read on Buddhistic fables/tales even) in an attempt to understand things better. The way some information you need to scrape out of your yurt and in some apparently hidden parts of the steppe I haven't found myself yet like the literal needle in the haystack has spawned some negative feedback by other players but I'm rather indecisive about it at the moment. The ending felt abrupt to me, I understood the gist of it I think, but I can see how someone who doesn't pay as much attention to all the details around the yurt and to the subtle implications by Ida or Enebish can feel heavily confused or "lost" after seeing the game's staff role. I would have loved to spend more time with Ida, maybe just do my own cosy thing in the steppe with her and Ongots, but this isn't the Cozyiness Simulator 2015 so I suppose it was right to end it as it did. But, that being said, I wouldn't mind to see other games that have me roam/experience unusal settings/places/cultures/ways of life like Cradle did.","August 2, 2015","false","1.5"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","17","29","0","0"

Let's just say, I'm terrible at picking presents for myself.\n\nThis is unplayable in current state. The lag, the frame rate issues, the slow mouse control (even turned up), the torturously slow walking speed - this is hell in game form. That's when it even starts, out of 10 load ups, twice it loaded. When it did load the lad up took forever. It's frustrating and needless.\n\nSure, the game might be OK - who knows? It would have taken an hour to leave the room I started in. I desperately wanted to like this game - love this game - instead I resent it cost me £8.49 on sale, a special buy, and plays so terribly. Such a let down, I've not been this disappointed by a game in quite some time.\n\nAdvice? Do not buy this until the devs have properly addressed these issues. Check the forums (which I should have done) to see the many people complaining of exactly this. Don't reward them for putting this out as a finished product.

It's a very realistic future world which we may get to see for real one day. The concept of having our soul/spirit/life force (call it what you will) embodied into an artificial life form where body parts and functions can be upgraded, has been around for a long time now, and this game really creates a great story to go with it. I won't put any spoilers in here as for the most part the story is what makes this game really stand out from the crowd.\n\nThe game gives you a great sense that you're in an open world which is beautifully styled. However the games story has a very ingenious way of preventing you from exploring too far from where you'll be spending most of the game, peforming tasks to progress the story a little bit further each time.\n\nMany people have complained about the mini arcade game section which can sometimes get frustrating, until you develop the right techniques to complete each one of them, which you must do in order to complete the game itself. The mini arcade games were initially enjoyable, but ultimately a frustrating and tedious affair.\n\nI do think there could've been much more made of the game than having to play virtually the same mini game for what seems like forever sometimes, but I guess this is probably one decision that had to be made due to budget or time, or both.\n\nI would've loved to see a bit more exploration and puzzle solving perhaps, and to see more the detailed world that always imagined was just over the hill in the distance, but always too far away to reach.\n\nI can thoroughly recommend this game to anyone with a love of Sci-Fi/Fantasy, and anyone out there that enjoy a highly detailed and rich game environment in which to explore.","March 3","true","7.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Yes, the ending is a little "wtf". Really the whole game left me staring blankly a lot. Imagine reading a really good sci-fi novel but having to skip every other page. You can kind of figure out what's going on, but you're never really sure. The quality of the voice acting is very high, but their constant monotone relaxed emotional state is off-putting. The low-res textures felt really out of place. I had a lot of geometry struggles that felt avoidable. I wasn't a big fan of the "rails" you are on. There is always and only ever one thing to do next.

Nothing about this game is fast paced. The story and exposition is delivered piecemeal, there is a fair bit of dialogue, a lot of reading, and even the run speed isn't particularly speedy. If you rush to the finish line you will not have a great time as I did. Which leads to the prime particuliarity of this game: the exposition is limited, the story will not hold your hand and it is largely up to the player to put everything together.\n\nThat isn't to say there aren't characters who will sit you down and explain things to you. That does happen. However whatever information you get from them is augmented by the dozens and dozens of notes, article clippings, phamplets and posters found in the Main Character's small home. Some of the keys you need to put the story together can only be found by combing through all the papers. The dialogue will only get you so far, and at one point the exposition stops. You will have everything you need if you're diligent (it isn't that hard, just reading) to add it all up, but the game isn't going to explain itself in the end. You'll only have theories. I feel pretty good that I'm right about mine which is enough to leave me satisfied, but that may not be everyone's cup of tea. Otherwise the world building and lore is top notch.\n\nAs for the actual gameplay, well. There are some mini games that are very platforming/jumping heavy and those aren't fantastic. There is a reason for those segments to exist story-wise, but they are the weakest parts of the game. They are thankfully slippable if you fail them once. I only managed to complete two, and they were not fun enough for me to want to retry the ones I failed. But that's OK, no penalties for failing and skipping. No combat, but there might be one or two instances where you need to throw sticks at things. You can keep some sticks in your inventory which is a tad clunky. The objects in the world will reset themselves after each storybeat/autosave and that was a blessing since I got a tad carried away with the physics and threw around everything.\n\nThere were occasional bugs, one of which required a fresh install to fix, and another to restart the game. Controller support technically exists but it's pretty poor.\n\nThe sounds and style are beautiful. I found myself honestly touched or upset at certain points in the story. The main character's voice acting is flat/monotone by design.\n\nMy recommendation is to play this game in a few chunks. I liked being able to chew on the story bits over night and let them ferment. It isn't a long game, and savoring the story and crafting theories helped build up the enjoyment. It gives you a compelling mystery, and I will play it again to experience it all from a new perspective. I still haven't found all the information and lore there is to find! Absolutely play this game (just know what you're getting into), it is one of my favourite scifi stories.","May 5","true","8.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Cradle has a very interesting and unique sci-fi story. The environments have an absolutely spectacular level of detail, providing you with more (optional) information about the setting than you'll be able to digest in one sitting. And while there are only a few characters, they have enough variety and character development to keep you engaged.\n\nThere are a few annoyances in Cradle that you should be aware of: The FOV is quite low and not configurable, mouse input has a weird smoothing applied to it and the first hour of the game is spent in a cramped indoor environment. If you get motion sickness easily from games, the first hour of gameplay will be pretty bad for you. Not as bad as Deus Ex: Human Revolution, but still noticeably bad. After you leave the indoor environment, it becomes a lot easier to deal with.\n\nThis game is about 4 hours long, but it has a satisfying ending and doesn't drag out any longer than it should.

If you fail, you have the choice of continuing anyhow, apparently.  When I failed the first one, I just quit the game before I was given this option.  I found out about the option from the forums here on Steam.  And then I beat all 4 of them without failing again, making it a moot point.  I don't find the cube games fun at all, just a time-waster.\n\nThe rest of the game is more like a sparsely-population hidden object game than a point-and-click adventure.  There are quite a few things to look at and move that are useless, and a few things here and there, usually hidden or halfway hidden, that are actually useful.  Unfortunately, if you find something early, you can't do any better than just remembering where it is.\n\nYour inventory is limited, and if you quit and load your game, everything is back where it was originally, unless it has to do with something that was changed permanently in a previous quest.\n\nIt's also possible to lose important items, forcing you to quit and load a game in order to be able to find them again.\n\nFinally, the story is...  illogical.  A lot of it makes no sense at all, and if you're a technical person you could very well rage against the tings they try to pass off as logical.\n\nIn the end, though, I enjoyed the game overall, so I'm recommending it.  I've focused on the bad points here, but the game is beautiful, the voice acting is pretty good, and it's fun to explore and solve even simple puzzles in such an environment.\n\nSteam says I spent 5.4 hrs playing the game at this point, but I'll probably go back and try to find some of the hidden texts that the achievements reference, so I'm guessing my hours will be higher later.

Cradle sure is an intriguing elevator pitch! It’s a shame the actual experience is short and yet somehow still feels padded and just doesn’t sustain this initial sense of mystery.\n\nBut let’s talk about the yurt first. It has one of the greatest sense of place I’ve seen in a videogame. It’s rickety thing worthy of the Middle Ages, but it holds a contemporary TV/DVD player, an early 20th century kitchen and futuristic doodads including the aforementioned android. It’s also credible as a lived in place: filled with family photos and documents to read, a Buddhist shrine, children’s toys, etc. It’s worth it tearing the place top to bottom to see what mysteries it has to reveal and it has quite a few.\n\nStepping out of the yurt for the first time is equally impressive. Hills lazily stretch over the horizon. A lone line of elevated hover train pylons leaves to the imagination the outside world it could connect to. The enormousness and remoteness of the steppe are well represented, but there is almost nothing to interact with out there, as can be expected. The only other place to explore is a derelict amusement park. The puzzles in Cradle should be mostly familiar to anyone who has played first person point-and-click adventure games. The park, however, adds a virtual reality Minecraft cube-digging minigame, as improbable and inopportune as that may sound. The game even tries to find a good reason why there would be block puzzles in the middle of the steppe. The explanation is about twice as implausible as the story reason why Quiet has to run around half naked in Metal Gear Solid V.\n\nThe story itself is just weird. I’ve wondered what kind of conversation some dude in the steppe would have with a robot chick. It turns out the answer is “a lot of dry exposition”. Cradle’s approach to sci-fi is to assault the player with a shotgun blast of gobbledygook. I won’t spoil it here, but I find it’s a lot of concepts crammed in a 4-5 hour game, culminating in a abrupt and quite odd ending. Some of it is compelling, but I have to admit it mostly didn’t do it for me.\n\nI didn’t terribly like Cradle, but I admire it’s ramshackle originality. It’s something that it somehow seems only Eastern Europe can produce (Pathologic and Stalker come to mind).

But even so there were times when I just got bored or frustrated. In the first 5 hours of gameplay, for example, I had an idea of what is going on and I thought of this game as a mediocre game. I even thought of giving this game 4/10. Suddenly it gave me a slap in the face and turned my expectation upside down. And it left me wanting for more.\n\nPros:\n+ Pretty good graphics. Neat texture and shape. Amazing lighting and shadow\n+ Very natural backgroud sound.\n+ Beautiful atmosphere\n+ Amazing story telling and story line\n+ Unique setting.\n+ Good dialogs\n\nCons:\n- Grass looks awful in close. Since player will be going out often, this can be major turnoff\n- Voice acting for the protagonist. Sounds bland and mundane.\n- Few bugs. Player can (but rarely) stuck in between objects and sounds suddenly mute and work again.\n- No visible legs and arms\n- Some bad and redundant puzzles\n- Barely any clues for solving some puzzles and getting the achievements\n- No note to keep all information to be re-read later on, which is a shame because those are the keys to understand this game and this game can throw everything at your face right from the start\n\nVerdict 7/10\nAs I mentioned earlier I was giving this game lower rating at the beginning. But the story progress in a weirdly amazing way that I could overlook the bad and enjoy the game. It is a pity that with only a few polish this game can be a cult classic. Cradle feels similar to the Vanishing of Ethan Carter in terms of gameplay but with its own plot twist. If you like Fallout or Portal but are tired of playing them, give this game a try. A great game for 12,99€. A steal at discounted price.\n\n(P.S I don't even get half of the idea of what is going on although Cradle has actually a proper ending)","May 16","true","7.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's incredibly atmospheric and immersive, but the world you see in the trailer is pretty much all you'll see in-game. Cradle's true value lies in the experience of piecing together the past with your attractive female companion through scattered texts and story progression. Gameplay can get pretty repetitive, and no new functions appear besides throwing things, picking things up, sprinting, walking, and jumping.\n\nSo don't go into the game expecting intense puzzles or gameplay. Both of them tend to be rather simple. Don't expect this game to last more than 4-8 hours, either.\n\nBut for what it's worth, the atmosphere and story absolutely sucked me in, and I wish there was more.\n\nWas it worth $13? I think so.

A living, breathing piece of art.\n\nI am really rooting for the developers of this game. Flying Cafe for Semianimals. If they decide one day to create something truly ambitious, i'm all in.\nThe graphics are gorgeous. The physics are good. The writing is interesting.\nHas it revolutionized it's genre? Maby. But it is without a doubt the singular catalyst wich may catapult the genre and force it to mutate into something that we have yet not been able to see or feel or touch.\nThe only negative, or rather, the only drawback, stems from my own personal preferance for intricate puzzles. This particular game, contrary to it's genre, has none. No traditional puzzles at least. It does have a game within the game though. a kind of cube manipulator game that's actually so good on it's own that it actaully made me feel like i was playing a completely different game, wich was sort of awesome, but it also completely broke the 4th wall for me. Luckily, this mode of "inception" makes sense storywise and it has something to do with the in game world, also telling a subtle story about the universe itself. You don't have to complete these if you don't want, but like i said, they operate like a game on it's own, i actually think they should release it on steam as a stand-alone title called "cube master" or something like that. Anyway. The story is great, the graphics are beautiful, the world is truly interesting. the ending may be off putting to some, but that probably means that you did not immerse yourself completely in the world, searching for all the different texts and piecing together the fate of the world you find yourself in.\nAlso there is some really moden physics at work here, at one point i thought i would have to manipulate the games inherent physics in order to solve puzzles, but this was not the case....that's not really a drawback though, it's just a testament to how much this game made me want to explore.\nit may not be for everyone, but i think everyone with half a brain should prevail upon themselves to try this out.\nOne of the most interesting games i have played in years.

The adventure-ish gameplay is well done and there's essentially no handholding outside some "hints" that act more like journal entries than actual hints and the environment is pretty interactable. An issue I have with it though is that it's often hard to accurately place items if you want to put them in various places because most items are held too close to the character and there's also no rotate key. There's tons of things to read and character dialogue (and your character is voiced, which is a strange choice as well) to flesh out the background and make the world even more mysterious and interesting.\n\nI've only played one of the minigames so far but it's shakes up the gameplay a bit. It can pretty quickly turn into a platforming nightmare if you start running out of blocks to stand on. The ability to skip these if you fail once though is a pretty strange choice.\n\nThe graphics are great too. Texture quality is pretty amazing for an indie game that costs $13 and so is pretty much everything else.\n\nThe bad however is that the game utterly fails on the technical options. Outside of texture quality, resolution, and vsync there's only a "quality" slider which goes from 1 to 10 so you can't really adjust individual options. There's also no way to rebind keys, which seems unthinkable for a PC game. No fov options either, and while I don't really get bothered by lov fov some people do. The lack of graphics options also isn't helped by the game potentially not being too well optimized. And even if it's just one option being pushed too far rather than lack of optimization, there's no way to individually adjust this option or even test to see what it is.\n\nSo yeah, overall the game is highly recommended for the game part as it has a decent bit of variety and mostly accomplishes what it sets out to do pretty well. The bizzare lack of common PC features though is a pretty large oversight and I have no idea how anyone of the devs thought "yes, this is a good state to release the game in".

Even though I generally dislike the "assemble a story from scraps of paper" approach to storytelling, and some of its parts were way too far-fetched for hard sci-fi (which I think it aims at), still, a solid effort.\n\nThe actual gameplay, however, is disappointingly lackluster. I disagree with the common consensus that the puzzles are easy. They are definitely not *hard*, conceptually, but they are just profoundly tedious. Think of pixel hunting 2.0 in 3d (somewhat clunky controls don't help either). The minigames are probably still worse, though. Again, they aren't particularly hard either, but they are so boring and uninteresting to play that I was really losing my temper when forced to go through them. I think the entire gameplay experience felt like walking waist-deep in molasses (not using a stronger word here, since it would probably be unfair).\n\nSo, sadly, can't really recommend it. 6/10.","August 5, 2015","false","8.0"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

No big deal. Ive neverhad a problem. My 360 controllers sticks are busted and they were causing some unwanted movement so i unpkugged it, upon unplugging it the game ran incredibly bad! I didnt know what the deal was so i reistalled it, I fiddles with some settings in Nvidia Control Panel and restarted my computer.. Still the game ran terrible! I lowered all the settings which made no difference so as a last ditch effort I thought "Maybe its got something to do with the controller being plugged in" so I plugged it back in... The game ran great! until it crashed.. No ive gotta reinstall it again to hopefully be able to play at all.

However the incredibly sudden and abrupt ending is the only ending to this game.\n\nIf you want to get lost in the world for ~4 to ~12 (my play time and the community's average playtime from what people have claimed) and don't mind going on a search for what really happened in the ending then buy this.

Some of them can be quite good - hell, The Stanley Parable was a decent game. But for a walking simulator to be good, it really needs to have an interesting world to explore, and the story needs to be well-written enough that we care enough to look around and try to figure out what's going on. Cradle is a beautiful game, but it is otherwise unbearable. The exploration is slow and humdrum, there are constant fetch quests, and the writing is incredibly bad. Not only that, but the game is dreadful on a technical level, with inexplicably jerky, slow movement, a frame rate which drops to about 15 fps unless a controller is plugged in, even when playing with the keyboard, and when trying to play with a controller, turning around causes your character to keep slow spinning in the same direction, as if all movement takes place on ice.

I got constant framerate drops.\nThere appears to be a lot of mouse smoothing/acceleration that makes the game very annoying for me to play.\nI tried using the controller instead, but there seemed to be no dead zones, so just resting my thumb on the analog stick slighty resulted in the camera moving.\n\nOverall, the first 5 minutes I played Cradle were not a good experience, so I decided to get a refund.

It's weird. Steam lacks an 'it's ok but....' option or even a middle of the road 'not good or bad' option. In the end, I weighed up what I enjoyed with what I didn't enjoy and felt the negatives were too pressing to for me to give this a flat out recommendation.\n\nHOWEVER - I will say I did actually enjoy this game for the most part.\n\nFirst off, the setting is beautiful. Set out on the empty steppes on Mongolia, it's really visually pleasing. The graphics are mostly decent with some good textures employed. The yurt in which you are based has been lovingly crafted, and really helps draw you into the world. The characters seem interesting - the robotic lady on your table is certainly interesting.\n\nI enjoyed the open world style of the game, though it's only really open world on a technicality. It's open world as in the setting of the game is entirely accesible to you - but there's not much going on out there. In all fairness, it's in the middle of the Mongolian Steppe so I'm not sure I'd expect much to be going on out there so it's not a major point.\n\nI liked the sounds in the game. The sounds of birds chirping, the wind blowing. This was good.\n\nThe story is fine, and actually has some depth to it. I think the game really could've done more with it but seeing as it's only a short game I guess I could give it a pass here. What we do learn of the story is rather intriguing. But this does lead me to a major negative for me - the story ended very abruptly, and at that point the ending didn't make too much sense to me. I was left scratching my head as to what happened. Without saying too much, I felt it just sort of ended and assumed we knew everything there was to know.\n\nThe optmisiation of this game was quite bad. My PC's specs are far and away above what this game recommends and I had a low frame rate for quite a lot of the game. As visually pleasing as it is, it really isn't too demanding graphically. I forced 60FPS using Radeon Settings panel which improved my FPS bit didn't fully solve the problem. This poor frame rate lead to laggy controls which made some navigating quite cumbersome and unweildy.\n\nThe game physics were kinda odd too. Once again, this may be due to the lag I described earlier, but it certainly drew me out of the game and just made it feel unweildy. Picking up objects and moving them around wasn't always smooth, and sometimes things would just get stuck. It was difficult to placet things gently on the table as if you let go of an object you just sort of drop it right in front of you - but for some reason I couldn't stand close enough to a table for my object to fall on it.\n\nWhen I put all the negatives together, I guess it felt rushed, or unfinished. A definite shame, because it looked so promising, and had hints of brilliance during the game. Some of the dialogue is really quite intelligent and thought provoking.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a game which demonstrated real potential. The ideas and world building were pretty good, but I felt the execution was ultimately flawed. If I were to recommend it on it's merits, I guess it's at the very best a cautious recomendation - if you can look past shoddy optimisation, and story telling which teases so much more than it actually presents.","March 1","false","5.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Its a first person, exploration scfi story. One of the best stories I have seen. Very entertaining. Slightly diappointing in length, but i think that was because I was really enjoying it. Beautiful graphics. Really nice. The backwards and forwards nature of the game becomes clear quite soon. Basically, there are 3 places you will visit during the game, and all of them are with a couple mins walking distance of each other. The game world looks huge, and you can watch things disappear in to the distance. A lot of space, only to have you run around in a couple of hundred square metre space. S you have a conversation. Go to a place. Complete a puzzle. Get rewarded with a plot item. Return home. Have another conversation. Go back to the same place and complete the same puzzle and get another plot item. This becaomes transparent quite early on, but the astonishing story kept me going. I just wanted to find out what happens next. Then, just as you start to find out who you are, it ends. The game just ends. I have never played a game that ends so abruptly. I don't get it. Its awul, and it marred the overall experience. If there is more to come, at least put 'To Be Continued...' but it just ends, and goes in to weird FMV sequence, with some awful music. if you would like to see the game, i have a start to finish playlist (the end will be published on 11th sept) so you can either just enjoy the story, or use it as a walkthrough. i will include a link at the end.\n\nmy overall impressions of this game were good. its a great story, well told, but marred by a large map with lots of wasted space, and a very abrupt and inconclusive ending. recommended.\nhere is the playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRdA17JHLxHtVlpBMZzQHiGokB2RRSjOd","September 9, 2015","true","7.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Pretty sure which way the story would end but still it doesn't feel like the type of story to leave to the audience to decide, especially since the ending cinematic implies more questions.\nWay too easy, especially the Squares sub games. I've seen reviews saying it takes hours to find items or or to figure out where to place them but the clues are there and they are usually very close by or hinted in <"> clues, the longest challenge I found was approx. 20mins on the Sun / Moon task but after reading the clues a second time even that was too easy.\nLittle child like naritive with the Beauty and Ugly tags, yes know where they were going with that but this could have been done a better way and added to the complexity of the story but since it's a game seems like they chose to dumb it down, not matching the complex back story, and would confuse the cinematic ending.\n\nI recommend the game as it is nicely done and for the price, and I enjoyed it but did finish feeling I wanted to see and know more but also more of a challenge.  It's is very much like an interactive movie.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/madary/recommended/361550/","madary","Miek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/madary/","144 products in account","tl;dr\nGood in general, short story, ok-ish controls, great design, amazing music and graphics.\n\n\nNote: This review may have a bias towards sci-fi games, because sci-fi is awesome!\n\nStory:\nLike with most quest games, the story gets revealed as you play the game. You learn about the protagonist's origins and some of the characters in the game, though not everything gets revealed. I failed to learn about the dark swirls which you encounter while exploring, though I have my suspicions. Perhaps I just have to play the game again and read/listen more carefully.\n\nGameplay:\nOverall good, though a bit sluggish for my taste. The normal walking speed seems a bit slow and you can only run with holding the left-shift key. I didnt find an autorun feature. Granted, the game world isn't huge, but it would have been nice to have. The game has no highlighting for interactable objects. Cradle features minigames that you have to play to further the storyline. Though they seem like crap on the screenshots, they're actually quite fun to do.\n\nDesign:\nI wished this game was bigger and featured more quests and such. Though being a rather short game, it does leave quite an impact. The idea of the m-bodies(the android woman) with a modular design could potentially turn this game into an adventure game where you craft/scavange parts to make your own body better. I can imagine a whole new game centered around this little gem.\nThe world goes from morning to night time, but not over time. Every stage you complete causes the sun to locate to a new position in the sky with a new set of clouds. It's quite charming to say the least.\n\nDialogue:\nThe game has dialogue options though not always relevant. It's really just click a trigger to listen/read the conversation and then click the next trigger. I think the game is to small to make this feature stand out.\n\nControls:\nThe object interaction may need some improvement. For example, I have the genometer(a scanner) and I want to try it on a flower(not knowing what I was doing at the time). Instead of the game telling me I can't use it on an item, or nothing happening at all, the tool just drops out of my hand. This is because left mouse-button makes you drop the item. I would prefer it to do nothing instead. If you're in the open with lots of grass, or even in the yurt(the tent) objects just seem to disappear. Just like in real life where your remote teleports to an alternate dimension when you leave it on the couch unattented. I accidentally threw a glass on the floor and had to look for it for 20 minutes untill I found it under the workbench. And yes, the damn glass was a quest item.. Good thing, when you reload the game, all items are back in their original spot, but I was late in figuring that out.\n\nAdditionally, it's actually rather hard to put something down properly. You pick up a lighter from the table and it's really hard to put it back on the table like a normal human being. You're holding the item really close to your body and dropping it means it falls on your toes. There's no way to extend the object's distance from the player to put it somewhere. It kind of frustrated me when I took the salt from a shelf and tried to put it back on the shelf. There's no way to do it properly so I had to throw it using the right-mouse button instead.\n\nAudio:\nGood in general. Voices are clear, interaction sounds are well defined. No annoying background sounds or anything done too well, if you know what I mean. Voice acting seems ok, though something seems odd about the protagonist's voice. It's like he got bored throughout the game. Just play the game, or watch a playthrough to see what I mean. Nevertheless, not annoying in any way.\n\nGraphics:\nAmazing! Just pick the android woman apart and look inside. It's all really well designed, modelled and textured. High quality textures and attention to fine details. One thing though, the leaves on the trees and the grass in the outdoors are bilboards, like in the old Duke games and the like. Not bad per se, it just seems they did that to cut on the rendering engine. It's already a GPU intensive game, and it isn't even Crisis.\n\nPrice:\nSo the game cost me 13 euro's and I found it to be a bit much considdering the story being a bit on the short end. I think 10 euro's would have been better. If you feel like spending those extra few bucks, then go for it. This game is a gem.\n\nConclusion:\nFinished the game in about 6 hours, and that includes just me derping around occasionally. Would play again, just for the music and the minigames..\n\nI hope this review has been useful. Cheers.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/recommended/361550/","FlamesSuperior","UpInFlames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/","263 products in account","This review was written for FREEDOM Community Gaming Collective[freedomcgc.com].\nI wake up in what seems like a strange hut. It’s adorned with all sorts of decorations that feel Central Asian. At first glance, it’s filled with familiar items you would expect to see in this setting such as a firewood stove, but on closer inspection, I see things straight out of the future. Strange contraptions, digitized flowers, and most peculiar of all, a mechanical woman is sitting on the table. Her upper body seems normal, but she’s been altered from the waist down to act as some sort of vase for the digitized flowers. She is deactivated. The big red button beckons me to press it. She starts to twitch randomly, then settles down for a brief moment and looks straight at me before she slouches over and shuts down once again. There’s a calendar by the door. It’s the year 2076 and I’m in Mongolia. This isn’t a hut, it’s a yurt. I open the door and step outside. At first I see a small fenced yard beyond which the horizon stretches out to uncover rolling hills among the steppes. I get the feeling that this is going to be one hell of a journey of discovery.\n\nCradle is a first-person adventure game by Ukrainian developer Flying Cafe for Semianimals. It weaves a fascinating, intriguing and wholly original science fiction story set in a world in which a cataclysmic event has made people unable to reproduce. In a desperate attempt to preserve humanity until a permanent solution is found, people transfer their souls and consciousness into mechanical bodies. You will discover many details about this complex, layered story as you freely inspect and interact with pretty much any item you find in the world such as magazines, journals, pictures and so on. You will also be able to interact with a couple of characters who will provide information and tasks which will move the story along. The writing is strong throughout and while it provides plenty of exposition regarding the world and what has been happening on a global scale, it failed to provide a meaningful emotional and personal connection between the two main characters. The fact that the voice acting for the playable character is rather stiff and detached created an even wider gulf in their relationship. However, I have to point out that the voice acting for the two non-playable characters is very convincing.\n\nThe true star of the game is its game world. While it is structured as an open world, it’s relatively small and mostly takes place in and around the yurt and a nearby deteriorated entertainment park. I didn’t found this to be a negative at all, I felt this focus created a true bond between the player and the surroundings. This strong sense of place is further heightened by the magnificent art style. There aren’t a whole lot of landmarks in the game, but each one is superbly detailed and everything just feels cohesive which is odd considering that it is a mixture of Central Asian, Eastern European (visible in the tram design, for example) and cyberpunk influences. I deeply appreciated the fact that the developers were able to create a world in which the old Mongolian tradition of eagle hunting mixes with cutting edge concepts such as transferring consciousness onto artificial carriers in a way that makes perfect sense. The subdued yet poignant soundtrack also added to the atmosphere immensely. I simply cannot overstate the impact of the game world on the enjoyment of the game.\n\nRegarding the gameplay, Cradle will mostly task you to find certain objects and use them in the appropriate way. For example, in the very beginning, the player is tasked to make breakfast. That means you’ll have to light the firewood stove, put the pot on it and then find and use all the necessary ingredients. Even though the game is a bit too obtuse at times (at one point, I spent around 15 minutes looking for a TV remote in the yurt which I found to be completely unnecessary and flat-out bad design), it is mostly rather generous with its hints and most items are where it makes sense for them to be. You have limited inventory slots at your disposal which is fine because you don’t need to collect and carry around everything you see and find. The puzzles are situational and you will only need certain items at specific points in time. Another big gameplay element are the mini-games you’ll have to do in the run-down entertainment park. These are arguably the weakest parts of the game. Basically, each time you’re placed a large room filled with cubes and you have to throw cubes of a certain color into some sort of digital stream in the center of the room. Your progress is impeded by digital enemies which will destroy cubes and/or block access to the stream. The whole ordeal feels tedious and laborious and it feels as if it was thrown in there just to provide some gameplay. Happily, you have the option to skip these segments if you happen to fail them, but you still have to endure the whole thing until you either succeed or fail.\n\nMy biggest and most serious complaint comes from the purely technical side. It’s not the game’s performance, it runs pretty well even on more modest systems, it’s the limited options and lack of key remapping. Just like a lot of warm-blooded PC gamers, the first thing I do when I start up a game is go to the settings menu. When I clicked on Cradle’s settings menu, it opened a single window with rather limited graphics options. There’s the V-sync, AA, texture and just a few other options including a 1-10 quality slider. Needless to say, it’s not really clear at all what this slider affects. However, while having limited graphics options is certainly not great, it’s not really such a big deal. On the other hand, I was appalled once I realized I cannot remap input controls in any way. The game uses a WASD control scheme which I’m sure a lot of people use and they’re fine with it, but the fact of the matter is that a lot of people do not use that scheme and it is simply inexcusable to release a PC game without the ability to remap keys. Cradle also does not have gamepad support, so the developers are quite literally saying that it’s their way or the highway. Being forced to play the game with a control scheme I do not prefer definitely had an impact on my overall enjoyment of the game and was the direct cause of frustration in certain segments of the game.\n\nCradle is a remarkable yet flawed game and I cannot escape the feeling that it could have been truly exceptional. It is held back by certain design and storytelling issues as well as an ending that is far too ambiguous for its own good, and it fails to provide all the necessary options for the player, but it shines due to its beautiful game world, intriguing theme and characters, and strong atmosphere. Despite its flaws, it is a game that should definitely be experienced by anyone who enjoys exploring fantastic worlds woven with a fresh science fiction story.\n\n7 OUT OF 10 (VERY GOOD)","August 3, 2015","true","9.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Some people say the game is beautiful. Real life deserts can be beautiful for sure, but in an adventure game deserts are just a bunch of sand to walk through. The gameplay consists of walking back and forth between a yort and a destroyed "amusement park". You play many itterations of a very annoying and out-of-place cube game in order to collect parts for your robotic girl pal (who also doubles as a virtual flower pot). In between trips to and from the park, you can also read the thousands of scraps of paper scattered around the yort in order to piece together the storyline of why you and your sexy robotic flower pot are even there to begin with.\n\nWhile the story that unfolds is interesting, it does not make up for the very constricted and mostly boring gameply.

For me, it's pros outweigh its quirky cons.  I bought the game because I tend to like science fiction and games that address cybernetics, artificial intelligence, singularity and transhumanist type concepts.  However, this story turned out to be very surreal and deals mostly with some really imaginative metaphyscis.  It feels like a myth transpiring against a sci-fi backdrop, which is really very charming.\n\nThe game pulled me in, with the very first room.  You start out in this wonderful little yurt, and it's obvious that the designers lovingly crafted the whole interior.  There is so much detail the place could be real.  The protagonist has no idea what is happening, which leaves you sifting through the contents of the dwelling, to try to make sense of things.  From there, you encounter several point and click adventure style puzzles and a few arcade mini-game sequences.  As you progress, the dialog helps make more sense of things.  But, if you want the ending to make sense, you have to thoroughly explore and read everything.  It's completely possible to finish the game without having any idea what the ending sequence is about, because all the reading that clears it up is completely optional.\n\nThe graphics are great, and really contribute to the immersive feel of the game.  The sound track is sparse, but beautiful in my opinion.  The voice acting is pretty solid, with 2 out of 3 primary speaking parts delivered quite well. Controls are simple and well suited to the genre.\n\nThe cons.  Running on Ubuntu 15, on a laptop with i7 and Windows Iris, I've had a few stability issues.  This has been the main drawback to the game. Also, the arcade mini games feel a bit clunky and agravating at times and the point and click style puzzles can be a bit on the easy side.  As wonderful and immsersive as the yurt is, it turns out there isn't really much more.  While practically every square inch of the place is interactive, there are few other locations, and everything else is very sparsely populated with interactive elements. Basically, the setting is just so immersive and interesting, that it leaves you wishing there was more.","November 3, 2015","true","41.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The story is very involved and deep, intriguing and original.  The game creators have done a great job with providing backstory content scattered throughout the "world."  It's a complicated story, but one that is adequately (and realistically) explained.  I say realistically because, were this the real world and you just woke up to it, there wouldn’t be a book lying next to you that had an answer to your every question.  You would have to piece things together from bits of information - which is exactly what the game makes you do.  It results in a very realistic and believable world.  So if you don't like reading or can't be bothered to read, then give this game a miss as you will not really understand what is happening, why it's happening, and certainly will not get the full enjoyment that you otherwise might.\n\nThe music is exceptional and the art is very well done.  The ending is just about perfect in my opinion.  Some say it was too abrupt or confusing - but I disagree.  If you actually take the time to explore the environment, read everything, and actually think about and process what you read, then the ending is just about as good as it gets - very well executed.\n\nMy only complaint is a minor one, and that is I feel the controls are a bit fuzzy (as in not precise - certainly doesn't have the precision of position/movement that a FPS might).  I don't know if this is intentional or just how the control implementation ended up.  For 99% of the game this is a non-issue.  For me, the 1 time precision was needed was a nightmare.  I ended up dying around 35 times.  In a row.  I felt it was quite unnecessary to the story - at no other point is that level of precision required in the game.  If you play the game and have no idea what I am talking about, consider yourself lucky.\n\nAt any rate, apart from the weird control responsiveness/behavior, the game is highly enjoyable and very satisfying from a storytelling perspective, and I recommend you giving it a play.

The atmosphere is the best part of the game, and it could probably succeed on it alone. While the explorable area is rather small, the enchanting environment of the Mongolian stepp is exceptionally captivating. The first impression it creates really made me want to like the rest of the game, but it clearly falls flat in a few areas.\n\nThe gameplay is partly point-click puzzling, which really prompts you to dig deep into the environment, however small. The other part is in strange cube-based block building/throwing minigames (of which I dreaded after the second time). Both of these become somewhat repetitive over time.\n\nThe story is woven from an amnesia-based "I forgot everything about who I am" perspective, allowing you to learn about the world through documents and a couple of characters in the game, who's presences are reserved and limited, contributing to the serenity of the atmosphere. The story that's built up is very intriguing, but ends like the game stopped telling the story, instead of concluding it.\n\nI don't know anything about the developer, but I would greatly appreciate a concise, free expansion/DLC to really conclude the game from them.\n\nThe largest plot-hole at the end and repetitive gameplay still don't completely outweigh the incredible atmosphere and environment, so I would still recommend this game, though waiting for a price drop or sale seems like a better idea.

Otherwise the frame rate drops to an jerky, unplayable mess. I am not the only one who has complained about this. I easily found comments on the forums complaining about this bug since the beginning of November and not a thing has been done to correct it.\n\nMajor Bug #2: If you have an official Playstation or Xbox brand controller plugged into your system when you try to play the game, you will find yourself locked into Crouch mode. You will find yourself staring at the undersides of tables and having to jump just to read the first note or interact with nearly anything. Again, the developers seem to be doing nothing to fix this problem besides saying that they are working on it.\n\nSo these two bugs combined to make my first few minutes of the game frustrating and absolutely intollerable for a game relying solely on environment immersement. Coupled that with the fact that the last patch to the game came in Early October, I had to return it. I do not expect the issues to be fixed any time soon and that truely saddens me. I wanted to like this game so much, but the bugs make it unplayable.","December 29, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(3 or 4 in the game). Every one the same just with different colours and every one as bad as the last. After the first one you will find yourself simply falling into the water and jumping up and down, just to speed up the process of failing and then being offered the "skip mini game" option.\n\nIts a massive shame as i instantly fell in love with this game when i first seen it about a year ago, it hinted at a lot more of an open world exploration puzzle game when in reality you get a yurt(tent) and a very small abandoned fairground with a couple of hundred meters worth of empty grasslands in between.\n\nCannot reccomend this at its current price, feels like an unfinished game that had completely "out of character" block throwing mini games to replace any meaningful exploration/puzzles. Might be worth checking out if you see it on sale at 60% off or more.","July 26, 2015","false","4.2"," 33 of 67 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","33","67","0","1"

I was just disappointed with the story and how it ended. It's a story about finding out how the apocalypse happened and what happened to Ida personally. I would not pick it up for full price. No you don't get to be invovled with the robot (Ida)romantically for those out there that maybe into that. To be fair, I kind of wish this was a possibility. you do get to choose dialog so why not add it in devs?\n\nThis game reminds me a lot of the look of fallout 4 as well, minus the clouds...but it plays nothing like it. There are no major quests to go on, nor combat. I was wondering if the game might be like it, but for 12 dollars, you can't expect that.\nWhen it comes to tasks, you'll only be going back and forth between your yurt(home) and a park. When you first see it...it's jaw dropping. After the first visit it's just meh and feels like a chore...lol\n\nThe minigames can be frustrating and sometimes the most fun you'll have in the game. You can choose to skip them and progress.\n\nIf I had to rate, 6/10. Ending was just disappointing as I've said. I think it should be turned into a full game where you can have a future with Ida where she also has functional legs.","July 25, 2015","true","9.8"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","13","27","0","0"

It isn't fun, and is tied to the story of the game only through symbolism that the game never bothers to explain.  It's first person platforming, which barely works at the best of times, while the environment is changed by red enemies that modify the level around you while you aren't looking.  No, no thank you.  I want more story and absolutely zero of that.\n\nThe other problem is that the story simply isn't in the game.  I've read some theories put together by people that make the story of the game make more sense, but the game doesn't get you there.  It simply implies greater things...that's not enough.  If you're going to tell a story, tell it.  Don't make us put together the symbolism to show off how clever your story is.  Once again, no thank you.\n\nI want more games like this, I want more games in this universe, even.  I want to know about the story of this game, but the game can't be bothered to tell its own story, and the gameplay it uses to gate it's story is no fun at all.  No, there's a glimmer of something brilliant here, but this impementation isn't something you want.","August 5, 2015","false","5.1"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

I mean, it's honestly great, but the terrible parts are so bad that it ruins the entire experience. Read on...\n\nThe base game - that is to say the stuff you spend 90% of your time actually doing - is fantastic. It takes place in the Mongolian Steppe, a location pretty much otherwise unknown in videogames. It's beautiful and quiet, sort of mysterious and sad. There's this strange plot line you need to unravel and it's kind of like a weird eastern European Myst. It's amazing.\n\nThen.... Then you get to the minigame "puzzles" you must solve to move the plot forward. Simply put, these are some of the worst puzzles ever designed for a videogame. Ever. They're extremely difficult, totally outside the graphical / aesthetic design sensibilites of the rest of the game and they feel tacked more tacked on than the boss fights in Deus Ex. The designers of the game know, in fact, that you most likely won't be able to finish these puzzles -- they're that unfair. After you lose, you have an option to skip them entirely. But losing takes, like, 5-10 minutes each time. And there are probably 6-7 of these "puzzles".\n\nThat's the thing about Cradle. It's like a perfectly designed meal, with beautiful and intriguing flavors and textures, except every ten minutes someone comes out and throws up all over your food. That would ruin the meal and, similarly, it ruins this game.","September 19, 2015","false","5.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"

The themes and story seem intriguing, if flawed in several details (antibiotics had no effect on the virus? you don't say.). The world is gorgeous. But the technical execution leaves much to be desired.\n\nThe puzzles required to proceed through most of the game are, to put it bluntly, sloppy. For example, very early on you must put a glass of water in a pot to heat it and cook something. I locate the faucet, I look for a glass, I find hundreds of cups in the house but of course none of them could possibly serve the purpose. I finally find the one specific glass which will function for the purpose, and you might think I could use the glass with the faucet, but that doesn't work. Perhaps I need to turn the faucet on before I pick up the glass, and use it on the running faucet? No dice. Maybe I could place the glass in the sink under the faucet, then turn it on so the water would fall inside? Well, apparently I'm not capable of holding the glass far enough away from my body to drop it in the sink, so it falls to the ground, either bounces wildly or clips through the floor, and I spend the next twenty minutes scouring the entire cluttered environment for the one specific small, transparent object I need, before restarting the whole game. As it turns out, you need to turn on the faucet before picking up the cup, then use it on a very specific tiny portion of the stream of water coming out, or you're doomed.\n\nThe basic engine used for moving around and carrying things is perhaps even less polished than the puzzle design. It starts with some kind of horrible mouse accelleration making it so that any small movement of my hand doesn't actually move my cursor at all, but a slightly larger movement will cause me to spin around entirely, but I can adjust to that. Then there's the character movement, which is clumsy at best, but workable as long as you don't need to do anything precisely or quickly. Picking items up means that you will never be able to put them down in a way other than dumping them on the floor and hoping for the best or throwing them off into the distance, but that's tricky to program and a lot of AAA games struggle with it. But what I really take issue with is that any time you're carrying a (probably vital) item in your hand, rather than your (arbitrarily and pointlessly tiny) inventory, it's not even locked to the position/orientation of your character, just constantly tugged in the direction of the cursor. Which might not be noticable while you're walking slowly and facing one direction, but the moment you try to run or turn around too fast, there's a significant chance that the item will fly out of your grip. Often never to be seen again, forcing you to re-load.\n\nAnd finally, several times over the course of the game, the story will be put on hold and all the wonderful characters and environments set aside in order for you to struggle through the mandatory "minigame" which consists of a poorly explained combination of platforming, minecraft, and pseudo-fps combat which is extremely easy to make impossible for yourself and serves to emphasize and magnify every single problem with the controls (and remind us all why first person platformers should never be a thing, in case you managed to forget the end of Half-Life).\n\nThe story, the world, the history, and the characters are all quite decent. Not a masterpiece for the ages perhaps, but not a disappointment and probably better than the majority of video games. But in order to experience them you'll have to wade through a great deal of frustration, tedium, and pointless backtracking, and it is extremely unlikely that you'll ever be able to work past the interface flaws well enough to become immersed in the experience. If you have a lot of spare time and patience feel free to invest it here, but most people will probably be better served playing something else.","March 8","false","1.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You end up dropping stuff all over the floor or just getting fustrated like I did and throwing it out the door. When you reload into the game the items are out back automatically.\n\nThen there is the voice acting or lack there of. These people are flat and just reading off a script, terribly I might add.\nThe character walks so slowly that you just want to lock him in "run" mode but you can't.\nThankfully the puzzles can be skipped after you fail it the first time and I just wait for the puzzle to end and get the item Anyway, they are just a wast of time IMO and could be better with a bit more variety.\n\nNow I have to say the world looks amazing and the story behind it has been enough to keep me playing but I will never finish it as the pace and gamelplay is just plan bad.

The way they talk to each other (the voice acting contributes to this a lot) made me enjoy the dialogs, which is something I use to get bothered of quickly.\n\nAs others have stated, this is just a point-n-clik adventure in first person view. Nothing more, nothing less. In fact, if it was a 2D game, it had only like 3-4 "screens" or scenaries where to go. That is. The game creates a false expectation of being open world, with a huge environment to explore, but in the end, there are only two places you can (need) to go, with some random walks here and there.\n\nThere are no hidden walls, but the protagonist just faints if he walks too far away from the main areas. For some reason, it's a really long walk before this happens, and this gives you yet another false impression: the thinking about the possible existence of reachable hidden places, secrets or anything worth it.\n\nIf I was the dev, I had placed A LOT (not just one) of interesting gadgets randomly scattered across the map, each one contributing with some feature for finding the rest. And achievements for finding them. And no...looking for sheets of paper is not that fun. The story is quite interesting but not to the point people would be craving for snippets of text.\n\nOn the other side, the landscape, and specially the background music are so beautifuly made, that sometimes I wished I could just make a fire and lay back looking at the night sky. That's probably where half my recorded hours come from. Just chilling out wandering the environment.\n\nTL;DR: Interesting story, beautiful graphics, amazing soundtrack. But it's just a 3D point-n-click adventure where you only get to see what the store page screenshots show you. Nothing more. The game is short, and it has ZERO replayability. It seems like it had had a very narrow budget. The devs did it well, but fell short in some areas like optimization and keyboard/mouse/gamepad customization. These two things alone are more than enough to tell picky gamers to stay away. I'm still kindly recommending the game for people with enough patience and different tastes.","December 27, 2015","true","16.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I loved the world, the writing. the aesthetics and the athmosphere. I actually enjoyed the openness of the ending witch seems to be complaint for many. But it's slightly on the short side and I see how this could have been one of the definitive gaming experience of my adult life but it just falls slightly flat... If there just had been some side quests to let us settle more into the world, maybe even third place to visit beside the yurt and dome. Maybe more interaction between the girl and our main character not directly involving the main storyline.\n\nOther gripe I've got is the decition to have player character have a voice. That feels a bit uncanny in a first person game, especially as the english voice actor was slightly on the stiff side. This tought I could overcome as the writing of the dialog is solid, as is the case with all the other writing done for this game. I also got a weird vegetanion sprite missalligment where leaves didn't touch the trunks of trees and the flowers didn't connect to any of the traws coming from the ground. Also the lack of FOV-slider and key-rebinding in the options menu, is to be mention. Altought it didn't bother me as I don't get motion sick and play with WASD.\n\nThen on to the positive side as aesthetics and graphics of this game are amazing. The world seems vibrant, but slighly washed out giving a feeling of mixture of reality and aquarelle painting. The visual desing of the android bodies is just something that will blow you away altought there's just two of them. They really look like something real humans have transferred their consciousness to. Something they live in and have personalised. The video eyes gives them amazing character and liveliness altought no other part of their face moves. The world feel lived in and seems to well match the slowly progressing disaster that is revealed have happen to humanity.\n\nContinuing with the positives music and the sound desing are also solid. You feel like you are on the mongolian steppe as the wind blows trought the trees and birds shirp in the air. Music is just spot on and is eary in the right way. Even in the pavillions the slightly cheerier music gives this overall wibe of something beeing slightly off.\n\nAfter those positives I've got one more gripe. There actually feels to be a slight pacing issue in the game. The main mechanic around exploring is not in any way timed or rushed. As for the opposition narrative driven in conversations with the girl drives a sense of urgency fairly early on (for spoiler reasons I will not reveal). I think this could have been fixed with more 'casual' conversations with the girl and the third character, and so giving the main conversational narrative a space to breathe same way the exploration has. Othervice the story and writing as mentioned is great. All the clippings are well written, characters make sense and even the lameish amnesia startingpoint is made to work trought what you find in the world and how you want to interpret them.\n\nAt the end I'd recommend this, but with a disclaimer. This game is mostly about the aesthetics, world, story and the athmosphere. It is somewhat lacking in the mechanics department having very limited and scripted interactions with the world. I would even compare it to 'Dear Esther' as a virtual installation altought with lots more interaction. In both narrative is given to you in pieces for you to interpret and the ending gives similar feeling of who or what was our pov-character in the end and what actually happenned.\n\nDespite there is lack of replay value with my other gripes, this game will most likely end up there with the rare games that I will revisit from time to time for that 'reading that familiar book wibe' and if I could find new angle on interpreting it.","July 27, 2015","true","11.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I am a big fan of first person and point and click adventure games and this game hits all the right spots for me. The game plops you down in the classic Mysty way; with a raging case of amnesia and lots of clues to uncover. The graphics, the atmosphere, the soundtrack, the puzzles, and the length all seem perfect to me. I also enjoyed the skippable arcade sequences which nicely break up the slow pace.\n\nWell worth the $13 price-tag. I would compare it to Vanishing of Ethan Carter which I also really loved except the zombie bit but I definitely like Cradle more. Cradle appeals to me more for its use of the classic inventory system and item based puzzles and high level of interactivity with the environment particularly inside the yurt which creates a great sense of immersion. Ethan Carter was extremely visually enthralling but lacked the interaction to really bring it home.\n\nIn regards to the ending; many reviews are complaining about it but I personally liked it a lot. When I got to the ending it seemed a little bit confusing but after going back to read all the newspaper clippings in the yurt everything fell into place and left me quite satisfied.\n\nMy one and only complaint would be the use of a checkpoint save system but luckily Cradle's checkpoint saves work well and work logically unlike Ethan Carter.","July 25, 2015","true","7.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The story itself takes place between three locations within very close proximity. All told, if you play it straight through it'll take only three or four hours at most.\n\nBut that's only if you do nothing but the quests while ignoring everything else, of which there is lots.\n\nIf you want to get the most out of the game, be prepared for a lot of reading. Every scrap of paper down to the newspaper that lines kitchen drawers holds bits of plot. Fortunately, it's very engaging text! While reading these is not technically necessary to finish the game, you are going to be extremely confused if you don't.\n\nThat said, what gameplay there is maintained my interest and left me wanting more up until the credits rolled.\n\nSpeaking of the ending: If you are someone who needs your endings to neatly wrap up the plot threads in a a nice neat package, this game is probably not for you. Or if you do play it, definitely seek out every bit of reading material you possibly can and, to lead into my final point...\n\n...EXPLORE. EVERYTHING.\n\nThere is a vast desert out there! Once you get the mechanics down, walk away from the plot for a while and go exploring. There are things out there that you will never even get the chance to notice if you strictly follow the plot.\n\nAll in all, it's exactly what I hoped it would be: A fascinating story with interesting game mechanics wrapped in an expansive world that you can get lost in for as long as you want.\n\nPlus it's only $16 for the deluxe edition with the kickarse soundtrack!","July 25, 2015","true","5.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The past 2 or 3 years I have begun playing many games halfway through then stopping to play another as they just don't hold my attention very well as they all seem to be lacking one or more things in favor of something else.  This game probably isn't for everyone so here are the major reasons that I enjoyed this game so much were:\n\n1) The way tasks worked like many older games there aren't arrows pointing to all of your objectives on the top of your screen or on a minimap.\n2) The backstory and plot were done in a way that makes sense, and you have to piece it all together from what you read, find in the enviroment, and learn from dialogue so it keeps the player more engaged rather than spoon feeding all of the story to them as they mash random buttons to victory.  This makes people like me who enjoy reading everything they can find in a game feel more rewarded.\n3) The game is all about exploration there really isn't any combat (though there sort of can be if you find the laser sword).\n4) The art style of the game is very well done everything in it all looks like it belongs nothing feels out of place, and there are a lot of small details that are very easy to miss.\n5) Most objects in the enviroment can be interacted with in a way similar to games such as Amnesia.\n\nThe game isn't perfect but I had a lot of fun with it and would say that it was easily worth the price.

Which is rare these days with all the crap that comes out on steam. But this one is a real gem.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough if you enjoy mystery, adventure, bonding, exploring and a little bit of puzzles. The lore is also really fantastic in this game.\n\nIn the name of shia lebouf, JUST BUY IT!","July 25, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The way they talk to each other (the voice acting contributes to this a lot) made me enjoy the dialogs, which is something I use to get bothered of quickly.\n\nAs others have stated, this is just a point-n-clik adventure in first person view. Nothing more, nothing less. In fact, if it was a 2D game, it had only like 3-4 "screens" or scenaries where to go. That is. The game creates a false expectation of being open world, with a huge environment to explore, but in the end, there are only two places you can (need) to go, with some random walks here and there.\n\nThere are no hidden walls, but the protagonist just faints if he walks too far away from the main areas. For some reason, it's a really long walk before this happens, and this gives you yet another false impression: the thinking about the possible existence of reachable hidden places, secrets or anything worth it.\n\nIf I was the dev, I had placed A LOT (not just one) of interesting gadgets randomly scattered across the map, each one contributing with some feature for finding the rest. And achievements for finding them. And no...looking for sheets of paper is not that fun. The story is quite interesting but not to the point people would be craving for snippets of text.\n\nOn the other side, the landscape, and specially the background music are so beautifuly made, that sometimes I wished I could just make a fire and lay back looking at the night sky. That's probably where half my recorded hours come from. Just chilling out wandering the environment.\n\nTL;DR: Interesting story, beautiful graphics, amazing soundtrack. But it's just a 3D point-n-click adventure where you only get to see what the store page screenshots show you. Nothing more. The game is short, and it has ZERO replayability. It seems like it had had a very narrow budget. The devs did it well, but fell short in some areas like optimization and keyboard/mouse/gamepad customization. These two things alone are more than enough to tell picky gamers to stay away. I'm still kindly recommending the game for people with enough patience and different tastes.","December 27, 2015","true","16.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Then download this waste of time.\n\nI understand this game has a puzzle and story based theme, but you spend annoying amounts of time tediously searching for small items with absolutely zero direction. No HUD, no marker. Nothing. Keep in mind, that this isn't considered part of any puzzle, because its self explanatory once you find what it is you are looking for.  Essentially you are tasked to search for some small object amongst tons of other things, and are given vague description of what it is you need.  The game will not allow something similar; you need the exact object.  The result is annoying trial and error and searching entire areas for some stupid item, simply so you can progress to the next thing you need to find.

I still ran into occasional glitches like objects being conflated to 2D (paper for the oven, plumfruits, Ongots' breastplate).\nOne of the first puzzles requires you to find salt. There's tons of crap in that yurt and a bunch of locked containers. It turns out the salt is in a box without readable label or any other clue to its content. So you either have to guess lucky or read it up in a forum, like I did.\nThere is no way to put back any of the stuff you pick up into the place where they belong (even though the game asks you to do that for the salt). Instead you drop everything to the floor like a clumsy idiot. After reloading a save game it's all back in place (thanks invisible clean up lady!).\n\nThe Good:\nThe graphics are good, it has a great atmosphere in a highly imaginative setting with an interesting story that runs at meditative pace. The contrast of nature and an esoteric lifestyle (you live in a yurt in the steppe that looks like a hippie store) with highly advanced technology is a great setting.\n\nThere's a lot to love about this game once you get past its technical shortcomings.","March 20","true","3.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Once you've done one, you've done them all, but you've no choice to keep doing them.  Additionally, the ultimate resolution to the story is a cheap deus-ex-machina that is only a step or two above "and then you wake up and it was all a dream."    It resoluves the plot on a macro level, but not the characters that we care about.\n\nStill, Cradle deserves credit for its uniqueness and for its attempt to tell a complex story full of imaginative scientific and metaphysical musings, even if the ultimate payoff for the story is anticlimactic.\n","August 29, 2015","true","5.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Go into it expecting to be the character you're playing. After completing the first play-through, I believe there is a major view that the player should prepare to take, that is, the view of life/culture-shock. If you can empathize with people in a coma, who wake up after being asleep for even just 10 years, and see the confusion they're in, then I believe you'll be able to welcome this game (and it's concept) with open arms.\n\nNow onto the game itself.\n\nStory: Phenomenal, I've read a lot of SciFi and this story feels extremely original and compelling. You can tell almost immediately that the devs focused heavily on building this entire world to be a possible alternate future, filled with cultural, medical, and societal changes. If anything I hope they use the success of Cradle to create a series of games built from this world (it's that compelling).\n\nGameplay: A little rough. The game controls very simply, but asks you to find and do some rather specific things that sometimes are just a tad frustrating. It feels as though the devs didn't get many chances to playtest the game to beta-testers.\n\nSound: Very good, though somewhat forceful at times. The music walks the fine line between 'forcing emotion' and 'boosting emotion'. As in, there's many moments in the game where a rush of powerful music doesn't push me to feel something, but rather, allows me to be overwhelmed with that feeling. Just now I'm realizing that whole situation may play purposefully in tandem with the game's core themes.\n\nValue: For $12, absolutely worth. It's like going to the movies and watching Interstellar with popcorn and soda. Only you can be at home and actually move at your own pace through the story (and have much cheaper popcorn and soda).\n\nSo ya, that's my takeaway. For those put-off by the ending (I'll be honest, I was pretty confused as well), please checkout the 'Ending' thread in the community hub, a lot of users there have already started piecing together the rather vague elements of the story.","August 27, 2015","true","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, when you have an interesting story line - a gripping narrative will help you put aside your gripes for various game mechanics.\n\nThats what Cradle does. The story draws you in while the world around you leaves you puzzled, curious, and your inner dialogue screams at you to learn everything that you can about this world you find yourself stuck in. Mayn games try to force you into a sense of a desperate need to understand your scenario. But they usually lack imagination and they can hardly ever really hook and reel you in.\n\nIve read the forums and people are complaining that the game is too short or they disparagingly call it a "walking simulator"; a crude attempt and transparent attempt at being facetious that immediately falls flat. Some people just play a lot of puzzle and narrative-driven games. They tend to make short work of them. Thats their own fault. Since I dont play a lot of puzzle games it takes me a while to figure some things out. And because my journey is more challenging it also tends to be more rewarding. I have a good amount of time into the game already. And the save system shows the chapters. Im about halfway through. So the $13 price point is spot on. Any more and it wouldve felt overpriced. Any less and it wouldve seemed like they were under-rating the value to try and dump copies on everyone, including people that only bought it because it was cheap.\n\nIf youre only going to play a few puzzle. story driven, simulation style games, then you have to own this one.","August 1, 2015","true","5.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GamingNinjaSheep/recommended/361550/","GamingNinjaSheep","GamingNinjaSheep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GamingNinjaSheep/","97 products in account","Story/Gameplay\nThis game is set somewhere in Mongolia year 2076. You wake up in a hut, or Yurt, and have no memory of who you are or where you are.\n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand in the way of storytelling, you have to figure out the story all by yourself, if you have time you can find a ton of reading material in the hut about what has happened, but the main story comes from the android woman on your desk which you have to repair. The game does however hold your hand through all the tasks you are given and tells you exactly how to solve everything, though you can choose not to read these hints if you want to, so it's not so bad.\n\nBack to the woman on your desk, the story progresses when you repair/replace a part in her and new information is revealed to you through her, because as she gains new components she remembers more things about her past. There is also another person/android which I think is an old friend, I'm not quite sure, but he reveals more information about the past in exchange for flowers (you will get it if you play it).\n\nNow, the way you collect these new parts is quite dull, you have to play one minigame for each part, which doesn't sound bad at first until you get to the second minigame and realize it's the same one, just altered a tiny bit. The whole thing becomes tedious after a while and you find yourself trying to rush through it so you can unlock more storytelling and not play stupid minigames involving cubes. The story reveals why these minigames exists and why you get parts after completing them, and also why they are so dull, but this could easily have been changed so they all are completely different from each other and not all consisting of cubes and still fit it into the story. This is one of the two things I didn't like about the game.\n\nThe second thing is that it states that it is open world, which it is, but you only go between two places all the time, you even find a thing so you can travel between these places quicker, and they are only like 500m apart. Sure you can go explore but there is nothing to be found, it's just a big steppe or whatever it's called. I think there are some collectibles laying around but I didn't find a single one.\n\nWhere this game really shines is in its story, they have created a really good backstory and an explanation to almost everything, there is a certain four digit code I have not found the explanation to yet, hopefully it is buried somewhere in all the readable things laying around, and yes, everything is readable, every little scrap of paper laying on the floor to long news articles, and everything is relevant in one way or another. You really get the sense that this guy is living out here all by himself, making his own electricity, food, water and selling flowers to his friend which comes by once in a while with supplies in exchange.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are what to be expected from a game in 2014. They have created an almost Borderlands type of filter, so it looks a bit cartooney or like it's drawn by hand. The skybox is a bit lacking in my opinion, the clouds do not fit in with the rest of the game so well, but I see where they are going with it, they just made it a bit too much 'hand drawn on paper'. But overall it's almost stunning how good they set the mood with the graphics alone.\n\nSound\nThe soundtrack of this game is also amazing, it really fits in with the story and setting. I never buy soundtracks for games but for this I am considering buying it, maybe.\n\nPrize/Rating\nIf you buy this game for the story, not the gameplay, you will have a great experience and a huge "aha" moment at the end. It's even fun to play through a second time when you know all the lore and understand everything that is being said. I played through it in a day, so it's not so long. It's 3€ too expensive in my opinion but still worth the money. I'm hoping for some sort of sequel, or even a prequel because the story is so rich and it would be interesting to see how other people live, and what the cities look like.","August 15, 2015","true","6.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It feels unique, and that's a rare quality.  The concepts in the story are interesting and make nice twists on stanard cyberpunk ideas.\n\nUnfortunately,  the 3d platforming minigames necessary to advance the plot, while justified by the story, are repetitive.  Once you've done one, you've done them all, but you've no choice to keep doing them.  Additionally, the ultimate resolution to the story is a cheap deus-ex-machina that is only a step or two above "and then you wake up and it was all a dream."    It resoluves the plot on a macro level, but not the characters that we care about.\n\nStill, Cradle deserves credit for its uniqueness and for its attempt to tell a complex story full of imaginative scientific and metaphysical musings, even if the ultimate payoff for the story is anticlimactic.\n","August 29, 2015","true","5.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Go into it expecting to be the character you're playing. After completing the first play-through, I believe there is a major view that the player should prepare to take, that is, the view of life/culture-shock. If you can empathize with people in a coma, who wake up after being asleep for even just 10 years, and see the confusion they're in, then I believe you'll be able to welcome this game (and it's concept) with open arms.\n\nNow onto the game itself.\n\nStory: Phenomenal, I've read a lot of SciFi and this story feels extremely original and compelling. You can tell almost immediately that the devs focused heavily on building this entire world to be a possible alternate future, filled with cultural, medical, and societal changes. If anything I hope they use the success of Cradle to create a series of games built from this world (it's that compelling).\n\nGameplay: A little rough. The game controls very simply, but asks you to find and do some rather specific things that sometimes are just a tad frustrating. It feels as though the devs didn't get many chances to playtest the game to beta-testers.\n\nSound: Very good, though somewhat forceful at times. The music walks the fine line between 'forcing emotion' and 'boosting emotion'. As in, there's many moments in the game where a rush of powerful music doesn't push me to feel something, but rather, allows me to be overwhelmed with that feeling. Just now I'm realizing that whole situation may play purposefully in tandem with the game's core themes.\n\nValue: For $12, absolutely worth. It's like going to the movies and watching Interstellar with popcorn and soda. Only you can be at home and actually move at your own pace through the story (and have much cheaper popcorn and soda).\n\nSo ya, that's my takeaway. For those put-off by the ending (I'll be honest, I was pretty confused as well), please checkout the 'Ending' thread in the community hub, a lot of users there have already started piecing together the rather vague elements of the story.","August 27, 2015","true","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The first puzzle (make some tea!) took me nearly 40 minutes before I understood completely. Each subsequent puzzle took less time. By the end of the game I was solving these puzzles intuitively.\n\nThis is a BEAUTIFUL game. When most games present the sky, they do it in a way that makes the player view it as "UP." But in this world the sky feels like it surrounds the yurt you wake up in. It's filled with the trappings of someone else's home and over the hill is an abandoned amusement park with warning signs. It all creates a sense of intrinsic mystery without explicitly saying anything.\n\nIt's not the most polished game. The end felt a little rushed and even a bit of a cop-out compared to modern discovery-story-driven games. The voice of the protagonist is not very good and there are some technical issues surrounding objects disappearing and moving with objects in general.\n\nIf you're a fan of old Myst games and virtual landscapes I couldn't recommend this more highly. If you're looking for heavy dialog and choice/consequence, this isn't your game. For me though, it was worth the full price.","July 29, 2015","true","7.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, when you have an interesting story line - a gripping narrative will help you put aside your gripes for various game mechanics.\n\nThats what Cradle does. The story draws you in while the world around you leaves you puzzled, curious, and your inner dialogue screams at you to learn everything that you can about this world you find yourself stuck in. Mayn games try to force you into a sense of a desperate need to understand your scenario. But they usually lack imagination and they can hardly ever really hook and reel you in.\n\nIve read the forums and people are complaining that the game is too short or they disparagingly call it a "walking simulator"; a crude attempt and transparent attempt at being facetious that immediately falls flat. Some people just play a lot of puzzle and narrative-driven games. They tend to make short work of them. Thats their own fault. Since I dont play a lot of puzzle games it takes me a while to figure some things out. And because my journey is more challenging it also tends to be more rewarding. I have a good amount of time into the game already. And the save system shows the chapters. Im about halfway through. So the $13 price point is spot on. Any more and it wouldve felt overpriced. Any less and it wouldve seemed like they were under-rating the value to try and dump copies on everyone, including people that only bought it because it was cheap.\n\nIf youre only going to play a few puzzle. story driven, simulation style games, then you have to own this one.","August 1, 2015","true","5.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Most is told through either text documents or between the two NPC:s in the game and the main character, but I got get the gist of it.\n\nPuzzles was not very confusing (in general) and the minigames was fun, a bit more variations wouldn't have hurt but in my opinion fun minigames none the less.\n\nMusic is soothing and suits my taste so for me the game was worth the money just for the soundtrack (which is included in collectors edition).\n\nNot sure on what to say about the game mechanics, best description is that they work and isn't overly complicated.\n\nI would have loved a bit more freedom of choice though since it feels rather linear (but achievement list did tell me I missed some things so a second playthrough is not unlikely in the near future to what I missed and if it really is as linear as it felt) And I don't regret buying it.\n\nNot sure on how much my description helps except that it is a short game, between 4-6 hours worth.\n\nAll in all a decent enough game (albeit short as stated above) with much self thinking since it doesn't hold your hand every inch of the way with a compass showing you where to go and what to do but it gives you a clear objective on what needs to be done.

Which from the very very very very very ridiculously brief and more confusing than anything else tutorial, should happen by filling the glass of water, which ALSO does not happen as is should by you know, making the glass interact with the tap, but instead, you have to turn the tap on, grab the glass... wiggle it somehow, and it's instantly full, having wasted about 10 litters of water... and you can't turn the tap off without dropping the glass first... which is fine, since the glass remains full now - a bit of positiveness I guess. I tried wiggling the glass of water over the red pot, clicking on it, which drops the glass, which remains full, I tried asking nicely, cursing, but it won't go in there...\n\nFirst time I opened the game, it was in window mode, with a very odd resolution. Fixed it, and the game went all Fubar on me, like I was doing a 360 non strop at high velocity. Closed it, reopened it, it worked.\n\nI stepped outside, FPS dropped for no apparent reason randomly...\n\nKeybinds can not be reassigned.\n\nAiming at what you want to is actually horribly hard and imprecise.\n\nThe music does seem to be nice, but that's all there seem to be, I would consider the game in Beta for now, and advise people to wait until the dev get it in a running state. A shame, the trailers peaked my interest, but regardless of how small the company making this is, this is not acceptable in my opinion, even at the current game's price.\n\nI guess it'd be worth buying if on sale for 75% or so, and if you have an ending amount of patience from what I've experienced so far.\n\nI'd also advise to check the forums on steam before buying, unlike me.\n\nI'm afraid I'll ask for a refund on this, while I will keep an eye on it, hoping it grows into something beautiful.\n\nThere is potiential, but it still needs work.","December 9, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The visuals, for the most part, are beautiful.  About half of the voice acting is  quality work.  The concepts and characters are compelling and can be generally identified with fairly readily.\n\nHowever,\nCradle falls short.  It is so good in certain ways but...  It's like a beautiful woman who is wearing heels too tall for her.  It looks beautiful, it seems like it might even have something interesting to say, and then it takes a misstep and falls on its face.\nThe subgames, though explained halfway through, feel jarringly out of place until that point.  Walking through the beautiful landscape generates a certain feeling that does not mesh well with the subgames, feeling like a hacking puzzle in an FPS, a contrived challenge that is just there to act as a weak barrier for you to mill through, separating chapters, making you backtrack, and not even being unique among themselves.  I feel like the game could have easily been better without them.\nThe story, though a bit confusing at times, is very well told for the most part.  The little snippets of information provided by the readings and the conversations point to a fascinating world with fascinating possibilities and a future like you've never quite imagined.\nAnd then you go back into the subgame, completely disengaging you from the storyline and presenting you with hoops you don't even have to jump through.  (I'll spoil this with no guilt.  If you fail a subgame, you can just skip it and still get the achievement.)  When you finish it and get back into the storyline, it gets even more interesting and tantalizing, a bit more of the story is revealed.  And then it goes back to the subgame.\nWorst of all is the ending.  It seems like it's really building to something.  It seems like it's getting ready for the big reveal, answers for your questions.  But it isn't.  It's going to give you a halfhearted hand waved in the vague direction of the answers to your questions and then ENDS WITH A DAMNED MUSIC VIDEO.  I'm not saying everything has to be handed to the player but there basically is no third act.  It jumps clear past it to a climax without epilogue, like watching the first two LotR movies and then skipping to the big final battle from the third movie and ending once the battle is won with no more explanation.\nI will say this though.  The soundtrack is beautiful.  I am still torn as to whether it's worth buying but it's definitely beautiful.\nIt was so good, except when it wasn't.  It could have been so much better, but it wasn't.  I'm not sorry I played it but no, I cannot recommend it.","January 6","false","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Interesting problems justify research, not trivial tasks made problematic by saturation of colours, clumsy controls and poor level design.\nFew examples:\n\n- What do you do at the beginning of a game? You look around trying to understand what to do. The environment is big, beautiful and inviting, curiosity will invite you for a walk around. Don't! Despite such environment you are not supposed to explore yet. Hit TAB and follow the game designer instructions but beware, while the invironment will give you plenty of simple solutions to simple problems, you will have stricktly stick with the designers solutions which often aren't clever.\n\n- Well, at least explore the room. Don't! You will see plenty of paper and this is deceiving, in fact, you will need paper to light a fire. Easy to find in such room, right? No, you need the right one. It is not hidden but if you explored the room you will waste your time considering many options. Annoying.\n\n- You need some salt, what do you go for? The thing that looks like salt in the kitchen or the red box not labeled in English? Well, you have to find the translation for the red random box. Like if salt is hard to find in a kitchen without google translator.\n\n- There is more but I will just add that objects are often small and hidden by saturation of colours.\n\nBtw, it looks great!","May 15","false","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Which would be perfect, because thats a genre that desperately needs some love, if it wasnt for the fact that all the puzzling is interspersed with some of the absolute worst attempts at "gameplay" ive come across in years in the form of Cradles Block puzzle rooms. Yes, these rooms are skippable, thankfully, but you still have to spend time actually trying to fail the block puzzles in order to skip them.\n\nPlaying Cradle is essentially like playing a really obtuse puzzle game, where the puzzles are weird enough to be kinda irritating, but the overall story and world is interesting enough that you want to see it through, but then the game throws a godawful first person platforming block puzzle at you just to really test the limits of your patience. Also, there are literally only maybe 3 locations in the entire game. Your tent, the amusement park, and the flying train thing. If youve seen screenshots of this game, youve probably seen every single thing there is to see.\n\nIf the devs ever patch in a button to auto skip the block puzzle rooms, i would recommend it as a curiosity worth taking a look at, until then, avoid.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IncredibleDuck/recommended/361550/","IncredibleDuck","Bono's Glasses","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IncredibleDuck/","121 products in account","Having just finished this game I feel incredibly compelled to write a review about it. This is largely due to what all the contents of the game have amounted in.\n\nFirst the basics: There's really not much to do in the game. While exploring the environment is fun for a little while you find yourself running between the same to places and completing the same challenge over and over. This challenge is really just a cube gathering minigame that feels amazingly out of place with the rest of the game.\n\nThere's also the fact that the voice acting brings nothing to the game. With a flat tone, even in dramatic parts of the game, it feels like there's no personality behind the characters. This detracts from the story greatly and makes me care more about the world I'm in than the characters I interact with.\n\nThe biggest shortcoming of the game is its ending. It feels rushed and really makes little sense.  In what could easily have been a halfway point for the game where everything gets turned around and all the questions get answered you instead get a 30 second blurry clip with some indie rock over it. The clip explains nothing and leaves you wondering about all the other things that had happened in the game and what they mean.\n\nVerdict:In the end the game is a fun distraction for a bit but its repetitiveness, lack of character development, and unfortunate ending all culminate into a game that could have been. It may have an interesting story but it fails to present it in an engaging way. It would be far better as a short story than a $13 game. For these reasons I can not honestly recommend this game to someone.\nFinal answer: No I would not reccomend this game.","August 20, 2015","false","6.0"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","0"

I hoped Cradle would be similar to Sunless Sea, a narrative style game I paid the same amount for, played for 95 hours, and enjoyed thoroughly.  It didn't turn out that way.  The favorable reviews will tell you what's right with the game, but I had three major problems with it.\n\nFirst, Cradle had massive lag between control inputs and responses.  I had to turn all the quality settings to minimum, including the resolution, in order to make the game playable.  As a result, the graphics were not pretty at all.  My computer meets the listed hardware requirements and is capable of better than this.\n\nSecond, I see now that none of the reviewers have logged more than seven hours of play time.  The game is short, and that's disappointing.  Seven hours isn't even enough time for the keyboard controls to feel natural to me, so I never got past that awkwardness to feel immersed in the game.\n\nThird, the cubes.  I had read about this controversial minigame, so I lowered my expectations.  But I found it jarringly out of place in Cradle and it further broke the game's immersion for me.  You can skip the minigame, but only after you've actually failed it.  I tried just walking away from the computer for a while during the cubes thing, but that didn't cause me to lose the round - you have to actively play badly in order to lose and get through the section.  Worst of all, you have to play the minigame not once but four times.  When I learned that, I was actually angry.\n\nThe devs have somehow got me to pay good money and spend my precious time playing some kind of Cube Crush Saga game like the ones my mother-in-law is constantly inviting me to play on FB.\n\nAs I write this, I'm three quarters of the way through the game and having trouble motivating myself to lose the fourth round of Cubes With Friends so I can, you know, read the ending.  Especially because other people seem pretty lukewarm about that ending.  I agree with other reviewers who have said this should have been a book, not a game.","August 11, 2015","false","6.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

There are questions that will never be answered. The world is strange, unnatural and begs exploration. You will look through dozens of small clues to get a big clue to get access to a bigger puzzle. That said none of this is part of the game. You will be doing this on your own OUTSIDE of the actual game.\n\nThe actual game is composed of a linear go here, solve basic puzzle structure of missions with timed events that will not trigger, unlock or be completable until you have solved the previous puzzle. It is the strictest of railroads we are speaking here. Should you find a piece of a puzzle three objectives down the line you shant be allowed to solve it on pain of the game forcing you to reload because you screwed up. On top of this are several minigames where you collect cubes, one stage of which I would like to punch whoever designed it.\n\nThe real game is a weird question. What the hell is going on? One which remains completely utterly unanswered. No matter of searching, no matter of thinking and no matter how far you roam you won't find the clues required to get an actual answer. The best you will do is some vague idea of what happened and a little sprinkle of magic. The why, for what reason or how won't really be answered.\n\nThat is why I can and both can't recommend this game.\n\nIf you enjoy thinking about a game long after it's done, going back and rereading certain messages and documents to make a bit more sense of it all, knowing you will never get an actual answer this is a game for you. The athmosphere is perfectly unsettling. The world so strange you will want to know more about it.\n\nHowever be warned that the game really is nothing more than a few dozen one quite obvious solution puzzles intersperced with a few block collecting minigames, that don't change except for a completely ridiculous difficulty spike on the third minigame. You will NOT get a satisfying conclusion to this story as even the meaning of what you did cannot be answered despite you sort of being able to puzzle together what you did. The ending is abrupt, following an edge of your seat moment, that peters out into an ending song that was quite nice, but a complete anticlimax because and I REALLY have to stress this. There is no way of knowing WHY what you did was important in ANY way!\n\nSo if you are like me and demand a game to be both mechanically sound and intersting with a clear method of answering the important questions you will feel let down in the end. If you simply want to play this game for the mystery it is a solid recommendation. Be warned though, it stays a mystery.\n\nPerhaps answers will be found in the sequel, Cradle 2: The Craddeling, but I don't play games to play the sequel so I can make sense of the first one.","August 22, 2015","false","5.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","1"

Instead I was greeted with a fun beginning quest and then nothing like it afterwards. The voice actress for Ida was really engaging, but hearing it contrasted with an inexperienced main character VA was hard to listen to. The main character's voice acting had absolutely no feeling to it and continued to take me out of the game. If the main character feels nothing why should the player? The game also has a large world but didn't make use of it. There's only two locations and only one of them was fun. I dreaded having to go to the second location (I've forgotten the name, it's very forgetful.) because of having to redo the same minigame over and over again. The minigame itself was out of place and hard to menuever in. If you lost enough pieces it was unbeatable. It was like playing two completely different games mashed together, but didn't mix well at all. The ending was extremely abrupt, and left me unfufilled. I expected a little more than what Cradle gives you for 12.99, but I suppose that was to pay for the graphics and exploding emotion virus story.","September 5, 2015","false","5.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Sadly, the world isn't really expanded upon and you don't see much of it (once you leave the yurt in the first couple minutes that's basically the whole game), a lot of the puzzles leave you to explore things for yourself and exlore aimlessly and the story is really convoluted. Also the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired and the strange Minecraft-esque puzzle you have to do several times over isn't all that fun after the first time.\n\nAlso, the ending... I can't even describe how terrible it is. It's a massive tonal shift from the rest of the game it's mind boggling as to how they decided to leave it in.

On the plus side, it's beautiful to look at, and the soundtrack is very good too (and worth getting), and there's a lot of setting detail to explore.\n\nUnfortunately though, while the final product is a valiant attempt, it's somewhat flawed:\n\nFor example - the background setting is pretty interesting, but it's somewhat incoherent. Concepts are introduced and then nothing is done with them. There's a lot of it scattered around the yurt that is your 'home base' but you don't really know which bits are important for the story and which aren't.\n\nThe four cube-puzzle mini-games also seem out of place and yanked me out of the atmosphere of the rest of the game somewhat. While they have an explanation in the plot, they're not really necessary to progress through the game (and fortunately you can skip them once you've played them once - but it would have been nicer to be able to skip them completely). Plus it gets a bit repetitive to have to keep going back to the Garden just to get more bits for Ida to continue the plot. Also, I thought the last game was pretty difficult to get to and particularly frustrating to play, which was really annoying.\n\nThe biggest problem though is the story itself. It just doesn't really hang together, and first time you see the ending I think there's a very good chance that you'll be saying "What?! WTF just happened here?". There are clues whose locations in the yurt are revealed in the final video, but you don't have a chance to look at them at that point and I was just left baffled by what I saw in the final sequence (and I didn't even know those specific clues were relevant beforehand anyway). I think that's pretty poor storytelling - they could have got Ida to do some more exposition about those clues during the game instead to make them stick in your memory more. And really, only three or four clues are relevant to the resolution of the story anyway. The other problem is that a big mystery of the game is who you actually are and what happened to you... and that's not revealed at all. That left me feeling very unsatisfied at the end, along with the failure of the ending to make any sense.\n\nHaving seen the ending and gone back to look at the clues and read some of the ideas on the forums about it afterwards, it kinda makes more sense now, but the flaws remain - the way it was put together just didn't work, and critical things are left totally unexplained. Don't get me wrong, I like endings that aren't handed to you on a plate, but I don't think we're given enough material to figure it out for ourselves the first time around.\n\nSo... it's an interesting setting (which in the end doesn't have all that much to do with the story being told here), but the key parts aren't really explained that well so it left me feeling very unsatisfied at the end. Would I recommend it though? Yes... despite its flaws I think I actually would, but wait a while and get it for cheap in a steam sale. The soundtrack is definitely worth getting though.","August 20, 2015","true","7.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Not that the latter part matters as they are skippable if you fail. So if you're not into that there's a way out. The block games aren't that hard once you get the concept though. Another thing to note is that the "Clue" feature is not a Hint feature but a task list. It tells you what you are supposed to do. I tried going at the game without using any hints and ended up spending 2 hours running around accomplishing nothing of value. I half-finished some things here and there and now after having completed the game realize how much of a waste of time it was. My only complaint about the game is that the named the task list "Clues".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cerzel/recommended/361550/","cerzel","Cerzel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cerzel/","487 products in account","Cradle is a mixed bag that provides a unique and interesting world and story that strings you along until the ending suddenly throws you into a wall.\n\nIn terms of puzzles:\nIt's not great. Something I've seen mentioned in many positive reviews is people praising how you can interact with so many items, but I find this claim disingenuous at best. There are plenty of items that you can pick up, carry around, and drop. Aside from that there's barely any interactivity in the game, and every item with an actual use has one use and one use only, at one point in the game, in one specific way. There's no freedom here, and most of the puzzles amount to "find X, pick up X, find Y, use X on Y". The other puzzles amount to searching for the next location you need to reach based on sometimes cryptic and not particularly specific clues (to find the X located there, naturally), so it doesn't exactly have much going for it in the gameplay department, other than walking back and forth, which you'll be doing a lot of, as the game repeatedly requires you to make the needlessly long trip between the yurt and the dome thanks to...\n\nThe minigames:\nFour times in the game you're sent off to do a simulation game where you have to find coloured blocks and throw them into an "elevator" until the game ends. While doing this you're hounded by an enemy that destroys blocks at regular intervals, and if you fall to the bottom of the game's arena, you lose blocks from your total. These are frustrating, tedious, boring, awkward, take too long, and really offer nothing to the game experience other than padding it out. They fit in the context of the game world, but they don't fit in the context of the gameplay. It's a poorly integrated distraction from the real appeal of the game, which is...\n\nThe story:\nAs an amnesiac protagonist, you wake up in a yurt with little idea of what's going on, and you spend the game trying to figure out who you are and what the story is of the robot girl Ida, who is immobilised there. If you think that "show, don't tell" are words to live by, this is not the game for you, because absolutely everything about the story is "tell, don't show". You read notes in the yurt to be told about the world's history. You listen to Ida tell you about her past, and the past of the game's area. You listen to Tabaha not really say much worth listening to at all, really. All this talking isn't helped by the player character's absolutely atrocious and monotonous voice acting putting a damper on every emotional scene, either. Then as you've been told enough for the story to hook you in, it ends.\nSince the story is the main draw, the abrupt and unsatisfying ending is not in its favour. You can figure out what's going on by scrawling through all the notes strewn about the game's world, and putting it together piece by piece, but this is a matter of grasping at straws and picking up on offhand mentions of crucial elements of the story hidden among page after page of less relevant world building.\nIt's not a satisfying way to deliver the story. It's not a satisfying story in the end either because even after piecing it together it still leaves much of it very vague, with the events boiling down to "well, it happened because it happened."\n\n\nAll in all, Cradle isn't a satisfying experience. It doesn't deliver satisfying puzzles. It doesn't deliver satisfying gameplay. It doesn't deliver satisfying exploration. And most of all, it doesn't deliver a satisfying story.","July 26, 2015","false","5.0"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","11","25","0","0"

It's still very unoptimized both gameplay-wise and engine-wise. I haven't played it much but it is difficult to get into it when the normal walking speed is so slow and the fast-walking speed is so fast.\n\nThe fact that the mouse moves around at 5 FPS in the menu (in the game, but not in the main menu outside the game) shows that the graphics engine the developers used could have just been left alone. There is no need to experiment with poor engines when there are many available that actually work very well.\n\nI would still not play the game in the present form due to the walking issues outlined above. I will try it a bit more and may change my mind.\n\nA note about Steam and Valve... I bought the game in November but didn't play it until December. As it was not working for me from December through January, I felt Steam (Valve) should have offered a refund. Despite what they may claim, Valve refuses to honor the Uniform Commercial Code by not refunding a product that does not work. They ignore the BBB as well.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bastwood/recommended/361550/","bastwood","Bastwood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bastwood/","689 products in account","Set in the Mongolian steppes about 60 years in the future, Cradle is a first-person adventure game with a rather unique premise. You wake up in a wonderfully detailed yurt that looks convincingly lived-in. Most of the worldbuilding in the game is concentrated in this tiny space, with dozens of newspaper clippings and foreign objects outlining a fascinating transhumanist future which has partially, but not completely, also arrived to this tent in the middle of nowhere.\n\nOutside on the vast plains, a hovertram line stretches out to the horizon with precious few other landmarks besides a huge, abandoned dome of some sorts. It's up to you to puzzle out the story and the big picture by reading and observing things, but mostly by gathering parts to an old android in your possession.\n\nGetting that thing to talk for the first time is a revelation in a game which had been very silent and tranquil up to that point. Unfortunately, at that time you will already have passed the best portions of the game. The first few hours of Cradle are as good as anything I've played, with a truly engaging world and lots of fresh ideas. Sure, you do run up against a rather jarring piece of videogame logic right in the first puzzle, but I was willing to forgive the game for that. However, it got much worse.\n\nIt's like the writers and designers eventually had no idea what to do with their creation. The story gets progressively less interesting when more and more details about it are revealed. The puzzles wither down to simple "find the switch" challenges that can get truly frustrating if you get stuck. The game isn't really willing to give you much pointers at all, which I can appreciate, but it is a bummer to run in circles for an hour just because you've missed a switch.\n\nEventually, the game settles into you just hiking between two points on continuous errands and forcing you to repeatedly play a ridiculous minigame that feels unbelieveably out of place with everything else and is absolutely not fun in the slightest. The minigame feels like an attempt to add more gameplay to decidedly a pretty walking-simulator-ish experience, but it just doesn't work at all. I feel like the entire sections could be stripped completely and the game would only be better for it.\n\nBetter or, well, as good it could be with the rest of the story continuing the sabotage the experience the futher you get. The story ends up being such a letdown, a mishmash of different scifi cliches slapped together to form a jumbled mess of disappointment.\n\nAfter the first few hours, I really thought Cradle would be one of my games of the year. After completing it, it's nowhere even close. It has an extremely engaging atmosphere and impressive graphics, but the story just twists upon itself way too many times and you end up feeling like chasing your own tail for half of the game. Such a shame! Huge wasted potential.","July 26, 2015","false","5.8"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","8","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pistachiojones/recommended/361550/","pistachiojones","Pistachio Jones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pistachiojones/","1425 products in account","TL;DR: Sadly, Cradle is a disappointing game that I can't recommend. It's got a fascinating world but is lacking in content - there's not much to explore once you leave the yurt. The gameplay leans a little too hard on the cube-collecting minigame once the content has been exhausted. The story starts out strong and but ends abruptly with little resolution.\n\nI love the premise and I wish I could recommend this game but it has a couple serious problems:\n\nFirst and foremost is the story. The story actually starts out great. You wake up in a Mongolian yurt with no memory. You're forced to piece together the world around you using different bits of context provided by all of the items in the yurt. After you piece together a robot friend you discover that she too has amnesia and you both begin a quest to discover your identities.\n\nUnfortunately the story ends without actually resolving this conflict. Just as it feels like you're turning a corner and discovering who you are and what's going on, the game just ends - out of nowhere. Ida the robot gives a cryptic line out of nowhere about how "sending a 4-digit code to Dr. Koch could have prevented everything" and then shuts off. After a quick jolt of electricity to Ida and an even quicker conversation with her (seriously, it's maybe 10 lines total), the last line of the game is "I'll explain everything later" which is followed immediately by the credits and an even more confusing video playing behind them.\n\nIt felt like there was an entire chunk of the story missing or just not explained. If it was presented in a piece of paper on the floor or something similar I'm not sure where that piece of paper could have been. I tried to be pretty thorough when I was looking around inside the yurt and at the nearby complex. I couldn't find anything that mentioned time travel or a "Dr. Koch".\n\nSecond is the cube-collecting minigame. The developers were "smart" not to feature much of this gameplay in the trailer because, frankly, I found it offputting. It's not necessarily bad, it's just really out of place in a game specifically advertised to focus on exploration.\n\nThe basic premise is that you're placed in a virtual world made of cubes and you have to collect 30 cubes of one specific color. You also have to enemies that blow up and destroy the ground underneath you and try not to fall to the bottom of the level. If you fall to the bottom you lose some of the cubes you've already collected.\n\nUnfortunately there are quite a few of these puzzles and there's a stretch of the game where you'll play the minigame, talk to Ida back at the yurt, and then go play a slight variation of the same minigame you JUST played with no real puzzle solving or exploration in between.","July 26, 2015","false","5.7"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","7","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gunnermacd/recommended/361550/","gunnermacd","[CDC] Gunner","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gunnermacd/","36 products in account","First of all, this review is from the perspective of an avid FPS, RTS gamer that also likes racing games. I look for games that can give me about $0.50 or less per hour of entertainment. At $13, I was hoping to get maybe 20-25 hours or so out of it but I don't think I can last that long.\n\nI was looking for a casual relaxing adventure game and Cradle caught my eye. After watching some game play on YouTube I decided to buy it. Fours hours in and I'm disappointed. It seems to get you into a grind, or misbehaves completely causing you to restart the game from a game defined save point.\n\nPros:\nGreat atmospherics, rich unique story line and really great music. This game has tremendous potential.\n\nCons:\nThe cube game. Tiring and doesn't enrich the overall story (that I could determine). I usually walk away and come back later to “skip” the game because I've lost and I get the game item anyhow.\n\nBad or inconsistent game physics. Picking things up and dropping/throwing them at times is tedious or difficult. I placed an item on the bed so I wouldn't have to look around on the floor for it. Wrong move. I could never pick up the item because the bed is selectable, all I could do was “sleep” when I tried to select the item on the bed. I had to restart the game and do a bunch of tedious things all over again.\n\nInventory. I believe an item was added to my inventory without my knowledge, but I can't be certain. Also, there is no callout on items, so you can pick up some technical thing and have no idea what it is. OK, maybe that's part of the game, but can add to the overall frustration.\n\nConclusion. Wonderful wonderful imagery, story line and music, and figuring out what to do in this “open world” is really fun. However basic game rules are inconsistent. Maybe this needs some really good QA. Not sure if this was early access with user feedback, if not, it should have been. Maybe this IS early access?\n\nFinally: Watch some YouTube game play and if you don't mind some grind and rule bending by the game machine, you might really enjoy this.\n\nCheers","July 26, 2015","false","3.9"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","7","21","0","0"

I think the best option is to look at what they offered on the store page.\n\n[Open World. Explore the mysterious and stylish world of the robotized Mongolia. Search the yurt, take a stroll down the river or head towards the entertainment park - this game has no fences you cannot overcome.]\nRobotized mongolia? No fences? There's 2 buildings, and you cannot explore outside of this area.\n\n[Living Characters. Communicate with NPCs. Owing to non-standard emotion display technology where actor eyes video is used, the NPCs in Cradle look as ‘live’ ones.]\nThis is great, but there's only two people you get to talk to.\n\n[Varied Gameplay. Mix thoughtful exploration quests with bright and dynamic mini-games.]\nThere's reading, then some walking, and then you play some sort of cube game that really has no replayability.\n\n[Interactive Environment. Interact with objects - all of them bear a part of the story and most can be used in the gameplay.] There are only a few key items that you need to progress through the story. You can pick stuff up but it's literally useless.\n\nI expected a short thoughtful game, but this was really advertised in an awful way. I loved the experience [besides the cube game], but felt like the game stopped right when it was going to get good.\n\nOverall I couldn't recommend the game for 12.99, but the potential was huge.\n\nClunky controls, bad english dub.\n\nTLDR: If you like artsy super short casual games, buy it during winter sale.\nOtherwise, nope. I wouldn't buy another game from this developer.\nI want to love you but I can't.\n\n*edit: I'm not being salty, it was good for what it was.

There's a drastic contrast between the rolling hills and meandering rivers of the steppe and the stark ruins of the “amusement park”, retro- futuristic mongolian yurt and hover train rings. There's something desolate, yet peaceful about the environment. The sweeping vistas are beautifully realized and the world feels lived in; by the end I was dying to see more.\n\nThe soundtrack is perfect for the setting and varies in flavor from relaxing eastern melodies to driving synth tracks amidst the more dramatic sequences.\n\nI personally enjoyed the narrative but it seems the ending is one of the highly debated topics on the community forums. If you get confused, many plot elements are clarified via clues densely scattered around the environment so a thorough playthrough is definitely rewarded. There is also a continually evolving community discussion on plot line theories and meaning for reference after completing the game.\n\nThe only real complaint I have is that some of the mechanics can be slightly frustrating and repetitive, although, to the devs credit, they give an option to skip these sequences.\n\nIn the end, Cradle is one of those games that draws you in and before you know it, it's two in the morning. If you are a sci-fi or adventure game fan - it's well worth the cost just to experience Cradle's unique dystopian vision of the future. You won't regret it.","September 10, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's one of those types of games that can be quite immersive, but unfortunately is plagued by several shortcomings.\n\nIt is generally a good looking game, but the FOV is bad for many.* And while the performance is good for a low-action game, the engine often feels poorly optimized.\n\nThe keys can't be rebound, and the arrow keys do not dupe the WSAD keys. Lefty hate again.*\n\nThe "Key Features" descriptions  are a little over-enthusiastic, especially about the mini-GAME (as in there's only one). It's repeated a couple times too many, varying only slightly each time (at least one of its modes is easier to beat).\n\nThe story and lore is absolutely fantastic, but the presentation feels disjointed. It would have been so much nicer if there was an in-game journal that collected everything you read, so you can go back and read it any time you want to understand things better. And the way the game ends makes it feel like chapter 1 of a series, but apparently the story is self-contained and resolved.\n\nAll in all, Cradle is still a recommended experience for those who love this type of game.\n\n*  UPDATE: The devs added dupe movement keys on the keypad; keys still can't be rebound at all, but at least that's better now. Also, FOV can now be adjusted, like a normal PC game!","October 9, 2015","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure, sometimes you wander around for a while looking for items you need because there are no hints as to where stuff is, and the world is kinda small meaning you'll visit the same two places the whole game, but the world is pretty and the visuals are uniquely beautiful.\n\nThe story deals with the concept of Neuro-copies and a plague that forces most of mankind into "M-bodies" (embody, get it?). You work to revive your flowerpot android and then the two of you will uncover both of your pasts as well as the history of nearby Gerbera Garden. This game is very story-driven with a LOT of dialogue and text to pay attention to.\n\nSecondary to the story is solving puzzles as well as a platforming "mini" game where you collect blocks. If you're even slightly familiar with Minecraft you'll understand the essence of the mini-games. As for the puzzles, they aren't terribly straightforward but also not ridiculously abstract. Finding items you'll need can take time, but given that your character has amnesia I suppose it makes sense to not really know where things are. For instance, I spent the better part of half an hour looking for roots to grind up to put in my bird soup only to find them right outside the front door.\n\nLastly, there are some flaws with how some story stuff doesn't appear to tie together at the end. Keep in mind it is entirely possible that I forgot some stuff because playing games on Ambien causes me to forget a LOT. Anyways, I imagine that the pieces I missed are probably actually there in the form of text items I missed. In fact, there is a LOT of flavor text. There is a bit of a problem discerning which pieces of text are "flavor" and which are "main ingredients" at times though.\n\nAnyways, if you want something with a good story, is fairly short (Maybe 4-6 hours including stumbling around looking for roots which are right outside the front door), has a nice puzzle aspect, and doesn't like quite like anything else I've ever seen; get this game. Just keep in mind there are a few flaws, some of which will get annoying (Like not knowing the roots are actually super close-by). At the very least, get this game on sale, but for the most part it's worth its price","October 2, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having become so immersed in the world and the unfolding backstory of the characters and their places in that world, I felt a little sad to say goodbye. The story was all wrapped up very well at the end, but even so, it would have been nice to have had more time to enjoy it.\n\nHaving said that, I had so much fun with this game, and I really feel that we need more adventurous and quirky storytelling in games such as this. I would love to see more from these developers in the future. I'm probably going to replay some of the puzzle levels for a little while yet.","February 28","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics, sound, and story are very captivating. However, when playing with a controler, the controls are horribly touchy and clunky. It took all the fun away, and it distracted from my concentration of immersing myself into the game and being able to figure out the puzzles. I've never had such a horrible experience, I felt I was fighting with the controls. Very bad controller design.","March 8","false","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like the abstract nature of the story, the environmental storytelling (shades of Gone Home), and the lack of hand-holding is a nice change from some in this genre.  There aren't really any mind-bending puzzles, but you do have to work out where things are that you need from time to time.  The game length is short but plenty long enough to get the concept across.  I look forward to more in-depth work from this crew in the future.\n\nPreface: PC specs are i5-6600k, AMD Radeon Fury, SSD.  Strong machine.\nThe framerate bogs down to the 20s unless you have a controller plugged in.  What?  It crashed to desktop a a few times (4-5) in various areas.  Loading times are very slow.  After (re)loading a save, the framerate is choppy for about 30 seconds.  Much of the gameplay is a rinse and repeat pattern of going to do a rather dull minigame, retrieve an object, and take it home from a short narrative.   Lastly, the lead actor's voice acting is dull and seems uninterested.\n\nThis is a neat game worth a few bucks but more effort with polish in stability would present a more attractive package.","January 10","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first sequence is interesting enough to draw you into the world of Cradle and continues to be very well paced with the characters giving you information finding things out as you are trying to find out stuff for yourself. But if you dont particularly like a "hiddent object game" characteristic to games that you play, I would insist that you use the community guide on steam to get you through it as I did. There also happens to be block based minigames which can be skipped if you fail once, though it does take a while to actually fail at the minigame even though your main obstruction happens to be a Huge ♥♥♥♥ to your progress and first person platforming isn't completely "on point".\n\nBasically if you can get past the Minecraft aspects in the minigames you'll find the will to complete this game and feel alright or good by the end. Oh almost forgot. it's not optimized yet FPS dips a lot, but the developer says they're working on this so maybe wait till it's fixed or play when you want.\n\n7/10 (has potential but not "great" yet)\n\n","January 28","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Therefore, it should be understood that my experience is limited. I will, however, impart my review for those who are interested.\n\nCradle is ultimately a very unique and enjoyable game. I truly enjoyed many elements of the game:\n\nThe scenery is beautiful and fun to explore. But keep in mind that although the immediate area is seemingly immense, there are boundaries and very little interactive components.\n\nThe music is perhaps one of the most intriguing factors of the game. In this respect I'm glad that I purchased the soundtrack. The artwork that comes with the package is decent but nothing extraordinary.\n\nThe character design is also great although there are only a few characters. Ida is very compelling and I'm left wanting to know more about her. My gripe about the main character is his voice acting. I've read that his lack of intonation and inflexion was the director's intention. But it still comes across as flat and unauthentic which really took a while to get used to in the game (if I actually ever did).\n\nSo here is my final analysis:\n\nThe game was very enjoyable. I did enjoy the storyline, but unless you're prepared to read every scrap of paper you come across, and are willing to delve into a little deduction and theory, you may not enjoy the game. The storyline's denouement is not self-evident and rather cryptic.\n\nThe gripe that I do have about the storyline is that it ends just as it starts to become intriguing. I'm not so much opposed as to how the game ends as I am to when it ends. What actually seems like the beginning of a deeper storyline actually becomes the ending. The game had so much potential to be great by adding more content which would have inevitably provided a much richer storyline and experience for the player. I'm left wanting to play so much more knowing that it cannot happen.\n\nFor example ( SPOILER ):  I truly wanted to explore more of the game with Ida by completely fixing her to the point she could walk around with me.\n\nI was also not so keen on the optional minigame which can be played a number of times as you advance through the game. I like challenges so I completed the minigame out of obligation. But I would've perfered that the developers spent more time extending the game rather than incorporating the minigame. But others may disagree with me on this point as it is relative to each person.\n\nFor the price the game is a good buy. I felt that I got my money's worth and really did enjoy the game. But it does have its issues which deprives Cradle from being phenomenal. Nevertheless, I recommned this game.","May 22","true","15.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I read some reviews complaining about an unresolved ending, but, given the storyline, I think one can only view the game as a "slice of life" out of the overall downward spiral of humanity to extinction.  What kind of a happy ending can you have while the human race (in game) is becoming a piece of nostalgia not unlike the clippings and memorabilia found around the yurt?","June 4","true","32.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
