It saddens me to see something so set up for success, so fresh in an aging series in serious need of a facelift, end up like the final product that we have today, which remains the lowest rated main entry in the series thus far. Angel of Darkness was in development hell for 3 years, and Core Design wanted Angel of Darkness to be different. They wanted it to compete with other successful titles such as Metal Gear Solid 2. Eidos wanted the game rushed to the market in order to make sales. And unfortunately, they got what they wanted: Angel of Darkness was commercially successful, but a buggy, broken, unfinished mess.\n\nThis is why it's such a shame that Angel of Darkness ended up like it did. There's evidence everywhere that this game is unfinished. Every addition to the game feels half-♥♥♥♥♥. There's elements like sneaking which you never have to use at all, ever. You can just as easily run up to guards and shoot them in the face. Taking out guards in sneaking mode requires them to be still and you behind them, and most of the time they're mobile so there's just no point. Hand-to-hand combat is again, more trouble than it's worth. Sprinting moves you faster but serves no purpose at all, unlike in previous entries. The infamous RPG elements in which Lara gets stronger by pushing boxes or kicking open doors could easily be removed entirely, and replaced with keys and switches. Collecting valuables and items to sell and purchase weapons and the like only appears once in the game, at the start, so for the rest of the game you're carrying around useless artifacts like rare records and vintage wine. Combat is also quite poor, and hampered further by the controls, which I'll cover in an entirely seperate paragraph.\n\nTank controls usually refers to a control method in which the player character moves forwards and backwards by pressing up and down, and turning by pressing left and right. Here, it seems that tank controls has been taken too literally, as Lara now has to accelerate from a snail's pace walk into a jog, and by the time you've started jogging, she sluggishly pulls to a halt and stands still for a couple of seconds. Vaulting objects and ladders simply requires Lara to stop next to them and press forward. Most of the time the game understands what you're doing, but other times Lara will just do a 180, vault over a railing and fall to her death. Vaulting from a crawling position back to standing (ie, crawling out from a vent) requires you to hold down walk and forward, which took me ages to figure out because it just made no sense. Looking requires you to be still and holding down the Sprint button. Combat changes the control system from tank into generally three dimensional movement, but your character will flail about like a ♥♥♥♥♥, and the sudden change from tank to free movement generally means you'll run straight into your adversary and take unnecessary damage.\n\nLet's not forget the bane of all banes in this game: the bugs. Lara will fall through solid surfaces, fail to grab onto ledges, will run forward diagonally in aiming mode if you press left or right, bump into ledges that lead to her inevitable death, manage to hang from a ledge from a standing position, but then not be able to get back up, and can run faster sideways on stairs than she can on a flat surface. Quicksaving works the majority of the time, but don't rely on it too much, especially in the final boss battle. The game will crash in some levels depending on what video settings you're using. Textures clip through each other, the camera clips through pretty much everying, halls of mirrors appear on just about every level, unfinished 3D objects only look right from one angle, cutscenes will play music but sometimes not sound or dialogue, items will randomly multiply in your inventory (I had 28 Periapt Shards at one point, even though there's only 3 in the game and they're key items), scripted encounters sometimes fail to spawn (the Cleaner proves irritating to most unlucky users, but thankfully I didn't run into this) and countless other bugs make their unwanted appearance. The Steam overlay freezes the game and alt-tabbing doesn't work most of the time. It's such a damn shame, because despite all the quirks, the engine is actually pretty solid, and with just even an extra month of time to work out the kinks, it could've been far better.\n\nSo what's good about this game? Thankfully, there's just as many good things as there are hideously broken things. It's aesthetically pleasing on all fronts. Environments and textures are incredibly detailed and far more believable than the previous five games. Character models could do with a bit more work, but they still look great. There's tons of graphical tweaks in the game's launcher, meaning that this game can look far better than its PS2 counterpart. The soundtrack is awesome, and the best in the series since the first. But by far the best thing is the plot. It's very well executed and genuinely emotional. Lara's transformation into a more cynical, badass and resilient heroine is a welcomed change to the one dimensional Lara from the previous games. In fact, the whole style of the game has undergone this change. Gone are the days of "wow this item is legendary artifact I must go to interesting country #4 and retrieve it to stop hackneyed villain #56 from using it for their own ends", and in its place is a muder mystery, horror-themed dark trek through Europe's criminal underworld and a cult who uses it as a front for their own plans. It's engaging and definitely the high point of the game, even if a lot of it was cut for the final release. Secondary characters have a lot of depth and you actually care about them.\n\nAnd the gameplay itself isn't that bad, once you get used to it. You learn to control Lara soon enough, even if it is a hassle. You still raid tombs, however scarce they are, the puzzles are pretty good, the environments are varied and refreshing (again, a lot of these were cut), and at least it's something different from fatigue that's set in after five years of the same thing. Dealing with the bugs becomes just another enemy to deal with, and the game still works. Just think of it as a beta! With all the crappy Early Access games flooding Steam nowadays, you can easily just imagine that Angel of Darkness is simply another one that will never be finished!\n\nI'm going to end my review by saying that this game was worth it in the end. It made me sad to think of what it could've been had Eidos not been greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and rushed it. It basically spelled the end of Core Design, of which the CEO resigned after the poor critical reception, and the company itself only released further disappointing casual games until its demise in 2007. It spelled the end of the first era of Tomb Raider. Crystal Dynamics took over and rewarded us with Legend, Anniversary, Underworld and 2013, all of which were critically and commercially successful. Finally, here's a Eurogamer article detailing more about the depressing story of Angel of Darkness, and the awesome community efforts being made to transform it into the game it deserved to be.\n\nhttp://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-10-12-the-fans-who-would-fix-tomb-raiders-most-broken-adventure\n\n3/5","November 4, 2014","true","18.3"," 91 of 100 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","91","100","2","0"

It’s not the sluggish controls, or the missing textures, or the plot inconsistencies, or Lara’s hilarious death cry that make this half-baked mess worth revisiting. It’s a game world in which everything you see and hear oozes with the atmosphere of a film noir. It’s a game world that rivals Shadow of the Colossus in its loneliness, Max Payne in its bleakness, and Resident Evil in its sense of growing dread. It’s a place we never thought we’d see Lara go, and a place we’ll never see her go again.\n\nFrom the onset, we’re plunged into the seedy urban backdrop of Paris, and immediately it feels foreign, alien - there is no Eiffel tower in the distance, no idyllic boulevards, nothing to imply any sense of comfort or hospitality. Instead we explore back alleys with barking dogs chained to the walls, rain falling on dumpsters that need emptying, drainpipes running along decrepit buildings that at a glance might resemble an ancient tomb.\n\nIn The Angel of Darkness, the exotic has not been replaced with the urban - the exotic has been replaced with the decaying and the abandoned. In this respect, the locales featured in the game are more similar to previous instalments than first assumed, and they retain the same sense of danger and peril, cranked up to eleven.\n\nThis is partly because of an engrossing story that sees Lara accused of a crime she cannot recall committing. She’s on her own, stalked by police determined to bring someone, anyone in, to feign progress in their investigation of a series of violent murders. Suddenly Lara’s status as a world famous adventurer counts for nothing - her only friend is dead and she’s by herself in an unfamiliar country. Worse yet, none of this is her choice - she has not chosen to be in this situation, and instead it is one she is forced to fight her way out of. It’s the setup to a rewarding plot well ahead of its time for 2003, marred by a few glaring flaws, but absolutely worth sticking out to its conclusion. There is a real sense of action here, both intelligent and thrilling.\n\nSometimes, however, the danger conveyed stems from unreliable controls, glitchy physics and trial-and-error platforming/combat. Earlier Tomb Raider games were not easy, but gameplay mechanics were in place that guaranteed consistency - a standing jump would always perform exactly as expected, as would a running jump, and even the simpler but essential action of walking could be depended on to save Lara from falling off a ledge, usually to the sound of cracking bones. In The Angel of Darkness, a more conscious use of these actions is required - walking may see Lara decide to drop down and grab the end of a ledge at a crucial moment, a standing jump with the wrong trajectory or too close to a wall may see her veer off in the wrong direction, and simply drawing a gun can be followed by all manner of movement hiccups. A poorly implemented upgrade system doesn’t help, giving Lara further jumps and a higher level of “grip” at regular intervals, presumably to offer a new element to platforming, but in reality only succeeding in making it harder to tell whether or not she’ll be able to clear that gap.\n\nLike most of the game’s design flaws and technical issues, this can be overcome by more patient gamers by a save system that can be used on-the-fly. From there, it’s a relatively smooth journey through around 30 levels of varying quality, each accompanied by one of the game’s saving graces, a haunting soundtrack that works as the perfect compliment to dark backstreets, unearthed tombs and industrial complexes acting as a front for something far, far more sinister. Cutscene direction enjoys similar success - arguably the game’s best moments are watched, not played - achieving a cinematic quality rivalled in 2003 only by the likes of Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy, not in terms of graphical fidelity but by a visual flair that goes beyond merely taking the audience from point A to B. Lara turns off the power, unwittingly unleashing a failed experiment (and setting up a boss fight for later), and we see the brutal havoc it leaves upon escaping its enclosure.\n\nThe Angel of Darkness is a beautiful disaster. Very little works as it should - the equilibrium of platforming, puzzles, and action perfected over the previous five instalments has been replaced by a Frankenstein of gameplay mechanics that, in spite of whatever intentions the developers might have had, do nothing in their existing form to enhance the overall experience. The game, then, is not for everyone. Yet there is enough here to entertain over its roughly 12 hour length, and if you can overlook the obvious issues, you may be lucky enough to catch a glimpse of the masterpiece that could have been.","November 30, 2015","true","3.4"," 65 of 68 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","65","68","0","9"

Was it worth it? You will find out here.Hint: At the end of this review you will find a TL;DR and a video section.\n\nThis review is based on a fixed version of Tomb Raider VI. You can download the community fix HERE.\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ REVIEW]▬▬▬▬●\nIn mid 2003, two and a half years after the release of Tomb Raider V: Chronicles, Eidos Interactive released the sixth follow-up of this franchise called "The Angel of Darkness", the last part of the series that was developed by Core Design. In that year, Core Design finds itself in great financial troubles since certain projects were canceled or not even as profitable as thought in the first place. The last best hope for the crippled company was the beloved Tomb Raider Franchise. During the development though, Core Design encountered several difficulties and Tomb Raider VI: The Angel of Darkness was delayed twice until Eidos Interactive released it on the Playstation 2 on June 2003. The intention was to get as much performance out of the Playstation 2 as possible, to please the fans but overall the wallet. Unfortunately, the affliction of Core Design and rushed release was not healthy for this game and the last project, planned first as a trilogy, was once again canceled. The final death blow for Core Design and the original Tomb Raider...\n\nLara's experience back in Egypt marked and changed her a lot. She stopped with the tomb raiding, which is only a fading memory for her and also got a darker and overall cynical appearance. Werner Von Croy, her formal mentor back in the days who is also involved in the event from Egypt, called Lara in despair and fear. Someone or something is stalking him ever since he contacted a suspicious person named Eckhardt, to track down one of five 14th century artworks called "The Obscura Paintings". Still in anger that Van Croy left her in Egypt, she argues with him. One thing leds to another and Lara Croft finds herself recovering consciousness and suffering from a memory loss in the destroyed appartement, lying next to the lifeless body from Werner. The police arrives and Lara has to find a way out of this misery, to find out what really happened inside the appartement. Digging for answers she gets involved with things, which should have stayed hidden.\n\nA lot has changed compared to the classic games. The most recognisable changes are the graphics; everything looks smooth, with even less blocks inside the polygones. More details and an overall more realistic aspect change not only the feeling but also the depth of this game. With a prober mouth and well made animations, friends and foes seem to be more alive and even more dangerous than in the previous games. Lara Croft herself got a new, darker appearance, fitting to the title and storyline. The atmosphere is incredible and underlines the darkness in the streets of Paris and Prague.\nThe level design is still linear, yet leant on to open world. Big maps with different areas and minor loading sequences will please the adventurer. Sadly, Tomb Raider VI: The Angel of Darkness has no secrets to report this time.\n\nCore Design went for another, interesting change and introduced the player to new gameplay mechanics, similar to RPG games. Whenever Lara performs an action on a special trigger object, e.g. shift a box, climb at the wall etc., she gains upper and lower strength, depending on what she has done before. Upper strength increase the stamina, which allows Lara to shift two stacked boxes, and climb longer on walls before loosing grip. Lower strength give her the abillity to run and to jump over wider gaps. Furthermore, Lara can now start a dialogue with nearby, friendly/neutral AIs in which the player can even choose what she should answer. This option has no direct impact in the actual story whatsoever, only if that special KI is willing to help out with some information or not.\nAnother feature that comes with Tomb Raider VI: The Angel of Darkness is the second playable character, Kurtis Trent, whom the player can play in later levels. Equipped with only one pistol, his levels focus less on agility but more on the direct battle. Both, Lara and Kurtis, are able to engage the enemy by melee combat, what mostly ends in a quick death for them though.\n\nLara's armory got a complete new coat. For a more realistic feeling, the normal pistol does not include unlimited ammunition anymore. On her way she will find several weapons like as a pistol with tranq darts, an electro shocker, different rifles and more. Beyond that, she got some fresh moves, such as a lower crawl and being able to climb on slants.\n\nThe sound and voice acting is greatly done and nice to listen to on the journey of Lara Croft.\n\nOne thing Core Design shouldn't have touched at any rate is the most hated aspect in the game: The controls. Not only the strange layout keeps destroying the gameplay, also the floating movements which increase the difficulty to move Lara accurately. At certain points the player will encounter one death after another, just because of this reason. Not even the mouse works correctly, which actually should change the camera angle. Frustration and a very uncomfortable gameplay destroy the mechanics of a game, that could have become a bestseller. Bugs and glitches appear here and there, such as missing textures and self-skipping cutscenes, which is not gamebreaking but from time to time annoying.\n\nThanks to the community something highly important can be noted here: The Community Fix, which is attached at the very beginning of this review. It fixes mostly every problem the game has with the controls and adds the compatibility with the steam overlay.\n\nAll in all the game suffers from few difficulties, due to the fact that Core Design rushed this game and threw it more or less "unfinished" at the market. It is a shame, since this game has so much potential. With the mentioned community fix, the biggest problem are nearly eliminated, so that the player can again start to enjoy this game!\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ RÉSUMÉ]▬▬▬▬●\nI am glad, that I gave Tomb Raider VI another chance, after one canceled try to play through this game. True, it is not as good as the other games of this franchise. And yes, true, the controls are the worst I have seen so far. Anyway, with some community made fixes and a few hours into this game I got used to the slowpoke and booty-floating controls. The story is not bad and the graphics do look good, even after all these years. An interesting idea are the RPG elements, not very well-thought but still a refreshing side of Tomb Raider. The ending made me thoughtful, since it was the end of the original Tomb Raider and Core Design itself. It was very open but as they say: The best goodbye's are those who are not said.\n\nEven with its problems I can still recommend it to fans of this franchise. Just keep in mind, that you install the above mentioned patch and you will have hours of fun!\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ TL;DR]▬▬▬▬●\n[✔] Community made fixes\n[✔] Great graphics and amazing atmosphere\n[✔] Rich story\n[✔] RPG-like skill/ability increase and dialogues\n[✔] Two playable characters\n\n[✖] Awful controls, some bugs & glitches (e.g. missing textures)\n[✖] Mouse controls are useless\n[✖] Start and end of a canceled trilogy, very open/not satisfying ending\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked this review and want to see more from me, give this review a thumbs up! I also appreciate every feedback!\n\nTo keep updated about my reviews, feel free to visit Morbs' Review Base and follow the curator page to never miss an review from me!\n\n- ℳorbus","March 5","true","18.9"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","27","32","0","9"

Sometimes during the game; the texture can glitch out at places                FMV quality is still the same as the PS2 version but it does not shrink the screen.

Some Boss segments can be tough to get past if you have no clue at first.        The Camera angle's need fixing for some parts as they can be frustrating to put up with                Puzzles are solvable; some that needs more clarification on        Some levels appear very linear for the most part in the game.\nYou have two playable characters in this game: Lara [mostly played] and Kurtis [Only 3 levels] with a Experimental RPG-system [Lara only] where she gets stronger during the game to allow more grip time and possibly commando crawling and sprinting. She gets them during the game not at any time.. The next is the stealth system: It works great though you can't really climb up with it on so turn off, Instant kill once snuck behind for choke hold; Not many levels use it and that can be positive for some.\n\nI'll give this game a 6 / 10. This game could've had great potential if Core Design wasn't bankrupt while Crystal Dynamics taken over. Sadly like some games; this game was delayed numerous times and as a proud developer the game had to be one of the first few on the PS2 to be released so their time was very limited. Nobody would recommend this game due to how frustratingly rushed it is and how flawed the systems are.. So at the least out of decency. I'd recommend the first five games or Legend, Anniversary or 2013.","June 30, 2015","false","15.2"," 41 of 57 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","41","57","0","0"

Despite that trend, I tried, against my better judgment, to like this game. Tomb Raider: The Prophecy for the GameBoy Advance was a better use of my time than this. If you absolutely must play another 3D(ish) Tomb Raider game from Core Design, go play that instead. I've heard all about how The Angel of Darkness was rushed, how it had potential to be great, and believe me, I sympathize fully with Core Design, and I don't fault them for what happened. But we're reviewing the game, here, not the team behind it. This is the product we got: it's unfinished, and it's subpar, to put it politely. And no amount of Kurtis can carry this game for the rest of us.\n\nWhat you have to understand, theoretical prospective buyer, is that this game is not just controversial, it nigh literally tore the franchise's fanbase in half (look no further than the proportion of thumbs up to thumbs down on this very review for evidence of that). While The Angel of Darkness was rushed out the door to coincide with the release of the movie that was coming out, it still spent three years in development, whereas the series had seen new releases yearly up until then. The game divided the fans between those with rational opinions ranging from "it sucks" to "it's the most average Tomb Raider has ever been," and those who developed a Stockholm Syndrome for it, because they invested their money and their time, spending hours finding convoluted ways to master its awful controls using engine quirks like making Lara roll in order to immediately put her into full running speed. Watch any gameplay video from someone who likes the game: they'll screw up, and it's clearly the game's faulty controls or awful physics at play, but they'll say they were just playing badly. These people will defend this game until the end of time, because they can't admit that theirs could have been better spent than playing this. If you've seen fans of Sonic '06 try to defend that game, you've seen what fans of this game are like.\n\nThe game is less immersive than its predecessors, and when the series standard was a game environment composed entirely out of blocks, that's saying a lot. Defenders of this game will praise the story and the ability to interact with characters, but the story doesn't go much of anywhere; it ends on a cliffhanger that assumed that The Angel of Darkness would be part one of a trilogy (spoiler alert: parts 2 and 3 never got released due to how poorly this game turned out), and the aforementioned characters only exist in the first quarter of the game, they are uninteresting, and they simply repeat themselves whenever you talk to them without getting a new plot device first. The game world's environment is also unconvincing due to the poor physics and bugs. When Lara falls in lava, she simply ragdolls on the surface like she would if she fell to her death on solid ground; she doesn't even catch fire. This game literally does LESS than the previous games to convince you that you're exploring a world rather than playing a game, and the previous games at least had the excuse of working with an inferior console. Defenders of this game will praise the graphics being better than the previous games, but if they can't produce a cohesive, believable world, I don't see the point; and yes, this game is VERY buggy, and even with the patch that comes with the Steam version, not everything is fixed. Sometimes huge chunks of the world will simply disappear. Lara will sometimes simply disappear. My sanity simply disappeared while playing this game.","December 7, 2013","false","10.7"," 64 of 98 people (65%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","65","64","98","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HeavyIsSandvich/recommended/225020/","HeavyIsSandvich","BluPhoenix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HeavyIsSandvich/","172 products in account","This game sucks.\n\nAs a long-time fan of the Tomb Raider series, I must confess- this is the only game in the entire franchise I dread playing, for a number of reasons. How is it even possible to make a misstep with such a beloved IP, and in such a grand scale? I'm not quite sure, but our boys at Core Design managed to do it. But is how the game turned out really their fault?\n\nKiiiiiiiinda.\n\nBack around 2002-2003 Eidos was suffering through some serious financial troubles, and had to reallocate where time and money was being spent. Several projects being published by Eidos were unfortunately canned or put on hold during this time- including Kronos' Fear Effect: Inferno (rip). As Eidos' cash cow, you could imagine why the Tomb Raider franchise was exempt to this. Core Design was trying to beat everything they could out of the potential for the PS2, promising that Lara's next day out would revolutionize how adventure games are made. By Q2 2003, Angel of Darkness would both be somewhat near finished, and would have been delayed twice already- but Core still needed more time. Eidos ended up putting their foot down and hurried it along for release just in time for the live-action film and counterpart "Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life" , select copies of the PS2 version of Angel of Darkness also came with free ticket vouchers to go see the movie! Great deal, right?\n\nAnd then you played the game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOiE0LCu6J0\n\nSo what makes this game so terrible? Well, there's a lot of things. But before we get into all that, let's talk about the positives this game brings-\n\n1. By far, the best part about this game would be both the sound design and soundtrack. Composed by Peter Connelly and Martin Iveson, the music is passionate, and really lets you feel like there's a lot at stake in Lara's predicament.\n2. New inventory system. This is a mixture of bad and good- I like that there's a number of recovery items now that affect you in varying strengths, that you can buy and sell items, and so on. BUT the way the system is incorporated is very weird. It's like they just copypasted the pause menu and put numbers on it.\n3. Graphical options. Oh my GOD. Click that setup button on the starting menu and you will feel like you're in the future with how many things you can fiddle with. This game came out 12 years ago, and it has a leg up on many AAA games in just how you can alter your game to your liking.\n\nAnd that's about it.\n\nOOOOOOOOOKAAAAY. Now for my favorite part.\n\nThe most heinous offender in this game would be the how the game handles. The controls are floatier than my fat ♥♥♥ coated in astroglide across an ice cap. It feels like they just tried to streamline the old grid-based movement system from previous games, which ironically makes jumping across gaps a lot harder. This is also the first game in the series to incorporate mouse control for the camera, and that seems like a well-needed improvement for the game, until you discover that it A) only works on the X-axis, B) moves lara around in whatever direction you're looking. Lara can still do flips and shoot and all that jazz, but it all feels so slow and clunky now. Frankly, most scripted animations in this game feel the same way. It kind of makes getting chased by a police helicopter through the streets of Paris lack a certain urgency through Lara's actions. You can sneak around, too, I guess. You'll only use this function maybe like two or three times in the whole game, and even then, you're only using it because that's when it's required. I find it hilarious that the every previous game has incredibly linear pathing, yet feels so much better to play with.\n\nAngel of Darkness now features a unique dialogue system. This is revolutionary because you have the choice of picking between a whopping TWO options when speaking to the quantity of emotionless mannequins that are known to populate Paris. (I learned a lot about Paris playing this game, did you know there's only one harlot in the entire ghetto?) The greatest part about this dialogue system is how amusing it is that these convos often lead to two very differing results. My personal favorite being A) make a deal and get a bunch of cool things, B) uhhhhhh you get shot.\n\nGOOD IDEA: Introduce RPG elements to an adventure game to increase the replay value, create various pathways/solutions to obstacles that can be utilized via whatever skills/stats you have (See: Deus Ex series)\n\nBAD IDEA: Introduce RPG elements to an adventure game and make only one solution to every obstacle, making it impossible to progress unless you've levelled the one stat you need, making "skill trees" merely a fetch quest (See: this game)\n\nThis is also the first game where you can plays as someone who isn't Lara, you get to play as chirugai-wielding badboy and Nine Inch Nails frontman, Kurtis Trent (Reznor). You only play as him in the last third of the game (in Prague), and even then you play as him for maybe like an hour or two. That's about it.\n\nGetting back to my previous point about the development process, a lot of people like to excuse this game because it was rushed by Eidos to fit in with the then-upcoming film release. But, you have to think about how much more "finished" this game could have been. It had started development with the turn of the millenium, and was originally slated for a Q4 2002 release- but was delayed until June 2003, and at that point, they still asked for some more time. Given that the entire story of the game was told, (yet unresolved, as there were originally supposed to be two games after this one to finish the arc it began) and a basic flow/design for the game's progression was established, you have to wonder what one more time extension really could have resolved. Sure, there'd be less bugs, but it wouldn't fix the rest of the game.\n\nBetween the bland, boring gameplay, the misplaced RPG elements, the terrible controls, I'm really wondering why I even bought this game on steam in the first place, I played it and hated it back on the PS2, so I can't imagine why I bothered to spend money on this game again. Maybe I just like to torment myself, maybe I just like to drop cash on garbage.\n\nBottom line: this game blows, don't waste money like I do.\n\nWhy not get a better Tomb Raider game, Instead? I highly recommend the original trilogy and Legend. The reboot isn't bad either.","December 5, 2015","false","9.3"," 38 of 57 people (67%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","67","38","57","9","1"

Tomb Raider VI got so much bad rep on release, however I feel it is some what over looked I first finished it on the PS2 back in the day and it wasnt that bad, now with that said the PC port (sperficly the controls) take along time to get used to. At the time of writing this review I have only clocked about 90 mins and I got used to the controls after quite a while. TR VI has very limited gamepad suport.\n\nWhen Eidos set out to make TR VI, which at the time was the first TR to appear on the PS2, they set the bar way to high and missed deadline after deadline, and they had no choice but to release it. Because of that TR VI is quite buggy and the RPG (if you can call it that) was incomplete and key features were missing from the game, like Lara's unlimted ammo duel pistols do not apear in this game.\n\nThe story is ok at best and set right after Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation and Chronicles, !!! SPOILER ALERT !!! (if you havent finished TR: TLR and Chronicles).\n\nLara has been framed for Von Croy's muder, but you soon find out about the Monstrum killings hapening around Paris.

None of these reviews give a background to why it has all of these flaws. This isnt really going to be a review of the game. I would recomend reading other reviews to find out about the acual game. This is just for players to read and to take into mind why the game has all these flaws.\n\n\nHere's the backstory to why the game was rushed (which I have adatpted from Wikipeda - I won't tell if you don't ;) )\n\nAOD started development in 2000, with the intention to create a new Tomb Raider game to compete with new action games and to also take advantage of the PS2's hardware. The team spilt into two groups, one working on Tomb Raider Chronicles, and another to work on AOD. Tomb Raider Chronicles had pushed the PSX to it's technical limits, so it was another resion to create a game with the PS2.\n\nAfter Chronicles had been completed the first version of the game was scrapped by lead Programmer Richard Morton as the game had became to overambitious for the PS2. Only the basic story had been developed. Development started again from the begining.\n\nIt was inteneted that Angel Of Darkness would have two sequals to them to continue the story.\n\nThe Angel of Darkness was unveiled  in March 2002 at E3. Problems with the game were sensed at an early stage.\nA release date was announced for November 2002, but the game got delayed into spring 2003 to  benefit from additional marketing support from Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life, the sequel to the original 2001 movie.\n\nDespite the delays, the company pushed Core Design to release the game in time for the marketing support. In order to meet the deadline, areas of the game containing key narrative elements had to be cut; one of the losses was the explanation of how the character survived the events of The Last Revelation.\nAmong other concepts that needed to be cut were two further locations, character animations, sound bites, and unique gameplay elements involving Kurtis.\nSome completed environmental assets also ended up being cut by mistake. Some of those elements were also deliberately left out by the team, who wished to bring them into future games.\n\nThe team at Core Design later said that they felt Eidos forced them to get the game out before it was ready. The game was also reportedly submitted eight times to Sony before its release. The game went gold on 18 June 2003, two days before its original release date. The game was finally released in the summer of 2003, alongside The Cradle of Life.\n\nThe game received strong initial sales, mostly driven by an aggressive advertising campaign. However The game received mixed to negative reviews from critics. critizing the controls, graphics and overall gameplay.\n\nThe Angel of Darkness caused multiple problems for the Tomb Raider franchise. Paramount Pictures faulted The Cradle of Life‍ '​s relatively inadequate box office performance on the poor critical reception, and backlash the video game received from its fans. The head of Core Design, Jeremy Heath-Smith, resigned after the release of the game,  and plans for a sequel called The Lost Dominion,part of a proposed trilogy created using the game's engine, were scrapped.\n\nEidos Interactive took the production of Tomb Raider games away from Core Design and assigned them to Crystal Dynamics, who has been making the Tomb Raider games ever since.\n","June 22, 2015","true","7.3"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","20","31","2","0"

So I had a better gaming experience than it was at the release.\n\nStory\nOne of the best in the series. I love how it's not a typical "Search for artifact without even have a clue why she is searching for it". The game was rushed and that's why it wasn't finished. The beta documents are in the internet so the story wouls've been better than it was already. But for now it's also great. I enjoyed the story and very well cutscenes. Also playing as Kurtis was also cool and that they put a second playable character in this game was something new, which I liked.\n\nGraphic\nThe game turns 13 years old this year, so of course it's old graphic engine. I like the style about it and that it's not trying to look realistic (like nowadays), instead it's kinda of a comic style. I prefer this style over the games who came after AOD.\n\nGameplay\nWe all know that the controls weren't the best but before I used the control fix, I never had problems with the controls so I don't really have nothing against them. The only things I didn't liked were that she does 2 slow moves and then starts running. The second thing was the control on stairs sometimes. That was annoying. The grip thing was interesting and maked it more realistic but climbing under time pressure wasn't so good. The rest of the controls were good. They were kinda like the old controls so.\n\nMusic\nThe soundtrack is also one of the best in the series. I love the theme song the most and also the others. If you want to listen to it, search it on youtube and listen to the beautiful soundtrack :)\nOverall\nThis game is one of my faves for some reasons (Really good story, the style of the Levels and good cutscenes for example). Many people dislike the controls or some bugs in this game but if you put them aside, you have a good game. I think it would've been the best TR, if it was finished and not rushed and released in an unfinished state. I recommend this game if you don't really care for bugs and the controls and just want to experience a good story with interesting game design than it's the perfect game for you :)\n\n(If you want some mods like the ones I mentioned earlier, than go to core-design.com and search in the community section for them)\n\n","February 28","true","8.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

For its time, it was running off of a truly next-gen engine, coupled with gorgeous graphics. It introduced many new additions to the series, such as  a large and expansive world filled with interactive environments, conversing with NPCs, furthering your quest through conversation, sidequests (unlike "secrets" in previous games), a playable second character (with a dark side of his own), and cleaver implementation of stealth, RPG, and horror-elements found in various levels throughout the game. The game's controls had a learning curve, like all Tomb Raider games do, and camera isn't always the best, but these issues seem minor when stacked up against the overall value of this package. Last but certainly not least, the story is at the forefront of the series. What initially begins as a neo-murder mystery (pertaining to the death of Lara's mentor), eventually turns into a massive conspiracy that Lara must unravel. AoD has the best story of the series, easily! And I am including the games of both reboots too. One unfortunate fact is that this game was the first part in a trilogy that was never completed due to many issues between the publisher and developer. It's sad really, especially since it concludes with a rather questionable cliffhanger ending. Buy this game, and give it a chance for yourself.

Stop to look around with the camera because sometimes things are hidden above like climbables. Sometimes pushing an object makes you stronger and then you can surpass a previous plateau. While in low enclosed spaces jumping offers more speed than "running " (before you get the sprint she runs so slow). At one point, you have to stay ducked and shoot a ghost who "can't reach you" right on the ground but he can fly through you standing up and above you ducked? At another point, to twist Lara 180 degrees while climbing under a ledge you have to continue to aim upward, thus reinforcing the theme of trial and error. There are multiple choices to make in these cinematic parts to each level. There is some sequence to areas but some things can be done in any order. There will be times when you should explore and find health, ammo, and weapons. Prepare to rations these out. Some  ammo are better for certain enemies and health is easily depleted by falls, traps, fire, and shots taken while running before sprint ability. Enemies don't always drop ammo either such as the dogs. While frustrating-ly difficult , this Lara Croft aims for a realistic feel of a fugitive: hunger(she steals candy bars and medical supplies), running from police, dealing with shady characters, The Monstrom Serial Killer, and constant danger in general. I have yelled at the screen in frustration and I have jumped out of my seat in excitement having felt like I earned bragging rights for beating a hard part of a level. The moral of the story...SAVE A LOT. It works like a save state and there are no auto saves. I had multiple saves so I could redo parts of the level and I would save with max health, after I picked up all the collectibles, and aimed right at the next part because you'll be dying a lot. 9/10 for difficulty and the satisfaction gained fron knowing it's balls hard.","August 6, 2014","true","49.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Also camera angles are fixed depending on Lara's position. You could use a controller, I guess, but I can't speak from experience.\n\nObvious console port, but on the plus side, good soundtrack, some decent lore, and it's a fairly good game for its time - it came out in 2003, people, the same year Warcraft III was released.  As for the environments, Paris isn't exactly bustling with life... the story is intriguing, Lara's a badass as usual, but honestly, the gameplay is sub-par.\nThat said, I've only played a few hours.

I still can't believe that i put 15 hours into it just to get all the items and access all the areas of the game (Since some decisions can change your pathway, witch actually was the only cool thing in this game).\n\nThe change of graphics of Tomb Raider was good, but i remember playing for the first time a long time ago. If you don't know how to config the graphics or isn't using the last patched version (Witch is Steam one), ohohoho. IT HAD SO MUCH GRAPHICAL GLITCHES. And the most updated product does still have theses glitches there and there...But i remember beating it for the first time, my eyes HURT.\n\nGameplay was AWFUL. Lara is slow and i swear to god that she wasn't supposed to jump THAT high. It's almost useless trying to make perfect jumps because you just can't. You will be trying over and over until you get it right. And that can kill your immersion, for example, in places like the temples of fire, earth, air and water.\n\nThe story is just....Well, actually plot isn't so bad. I don't actually like the changes do Lara's behavior, she could do anything in this game without begin rude as she was. Old Lara wasn't rude, but sarcastic. And that was her touch. That's why she is one of the best female protagonists of games. TRAOD just kill this personality of Lara. That's the only thing that i don't like of the plot. If you read Vernom notes and explore the games, they actually give nice details about the origin of many things, letting us think that they actually put some effort on making the game story, witch is cool. The other thing that bothers me are the characters. Aside from Kurtis, i just can't remember anyone that i wanted to know his or her story. Most of them are boring and killing Werner was bad idea. If he at least was alive, it could be so much better. Kurtis' story is mostly unknown. By the end of the game, we don't really know much about him, besides that his dad was killed by the bad guys and he wants vengeance. The cliffhanger ending however blows this fact. We don't know if Kurtis was who he really was or if it was something else. This game, for whose don't know, was supposed to be a trilogy (Thank God that din't happen) and that cliffhanger ending was supposed to be where the next game would start. Then Legend happened (Thank God, again).\n\nAside from menu music and some others, it's quite forgetable. Since most of it is a constant loop of suspense themes. And there are sounds re-used from Tomb Raider 5. Voice in this game isn't bad. Lara's voice is actually great, and so are others. Actually i think i only like Eckard (IDK if his name is spelled like this) as a villain because of his voice. The only voice that i din't liked was Boraz.\n\nThere are two things that i liked in this game: Level Design and exploration.\nLevel design actually is pretty good. I like the part of the temples and how we go through then. If only jump was a little lower, maybe these areas would be pleasurable to play. Most of the part of the game is in Paris, but it don't gets to repetitive since there are new places to explore. And exploration, different from other games, is not as much reward-full, but it will always gets you ammo or health. Water levels were a cool thing too. I missed then from Tomb Raider 2 and 4. This game was designed to have multiple choices, so you could get to new areas or don't get anywhere are all (Yes, there ARE choices that kill you, wonderful). It's was a nice touch, dialogue choices and different pathways was never introduced on Tomb Raider until this game. And this feature was completely forget since this one. I would really like to see it again, since most actual games now have multiple pathways and endings. Maybe because this game was bad (Or din't had any extra ending at all) they decided to never use it again. That's sad.\n\nIf there are two things that i ABSOLUTELY HATED about this game was: Money and selling. You can use your money to bet it with other people (Witch actually is just one person in a church, lol) or to subordinate (Witch, again, i only saw begin used in this way one time. The journalist that says "Your credit runned out" will always says this not matter how much money you have). There two methods of getting money: Finding it or selling goodies that you find through the game. SELLING IS USELLES. All the money that you find is enough to bet it and win (Because you can save before betting it) AND to subordinate people (SINCE IT'S ONLY ONE). So, if i can't buy weapons or anything, WHY ARE GOODIES HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE? And there's more! If you don't sell all the goodies before the trader gets killed (YES! THE TRADER DIES!), YOU CAN'T SELL IT ANYMORE! YOU WILL HAVE TO CARRY USELESS ITEMS UNTIL THE END OF THE FREAKING GAME! JESUS CHRIST, WHY?! WHY DID WE NEED THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE?! ISN'T LARA, LIKE, RICH? Can't she pay them with her own money? Or, if she can't right now, give something that she will remember and pay them later?\n\nOr else? Couldn't she just avoid all this game's story if she payed an advocate? Seriously, guard just started chasing her think she was The Moustrum WITH NO PROOFS AT ALL. They put DEADLY DOGS to chase her. Damn. I know they believe she committed a murder. But what about paralyzing? Can't they just put her to sleep or something? What about THE FREAKING MANY TIMES SHE SAVED THE WORLD? ARE THEY JUST GOING TO, LIKE, FORGET IT?! AND CHASE HER NO MATTER WHAT AND WITHOUT PROOFS?! And i'm still wanting to know how the police find out about the assassination in the first place. Did Eckard called they? Or something? God, why this game had to happen in the first place?\n\n0/10. Will. Never. Play. Again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nww02/recommended/225020/","nww02","<Insert Name Here>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nww02/","400 products in account","TR6 was the third in a sequence of TR games made to a story arc.  Lara had been working with her old mentor in TR4 to uncover some secret in a pyramid, when the structure collapsed.  Lara was left for dead.  After the rescue efforts finally were given up, a bunch of her "old friends" got together to tell the tales of her younger self... meanwhile something was happening to Lara somewhere....   Later..  TR6 happened... She's back, and she's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at her former mentor, but for some reason still considers him a friend.  What happened... how did she end up both annoyed, and friendly? Who knows.  TR6 should have told you in the intro, but didn't.        The intro consists of a confusing "radio announcement" about some killings, and then dumps you into a city chase without so much as an explanation.      And so begins the (so far) weakest of the Tomb Raider games.\n\nFrom the name, you'd assume you'd be raiding tombs... but like several of its predecessors, you spend a lot of time in cities, apartments, burning buildings and so on.  While okay to tell the plot, the amount of time above ground, or in modern structures  is equal to (or greater than) the time below ground in ancient ones.\n\nThe plot is okay.. Lara's on the run, there's some bad dudes.. Guess who has to stop them.. the usual...   The only thing that's vaguely new in this game is the use of a proper 3d environment... Gone are the blocks and sharp angles of previous TR games. you've now got polygons coming at you from all angles.  There's volumetric fog, lighting, shadows.. all sorts of new graphical stuff to delight the eye.\n\nIt's just a shame that the majority of it is buggy as hell.    This is the first TR game where I've experienced a crash.  Usually in the AI path-finding (according to the debug log), or fallen "through" the scenery, endlessly falling...\n\nIt's also the first time I've been truly truly annoyed at the controls.    There are some sections of the game where the camera doesn't help you perform a sequence of moves (there's a few sections in TR:Chronicles on the irish haunted island which come to mind), but in this game, the camera can sometimes be behind a door, plant, wall, or just facing in the least useful way possible.     Often you'll be stalking a corridor, and something will walk up behind you and stab you to death. You didn't see it because the camera was such a stupid angle, you couldn't have.\n\nCamera aside, the single most annoying thing about this game are the controls.   Gone are the fluid jumps and flips of previous games.  In this game, they chose to animate lara using animation chains that cannot be interrupted by you.   Sometimes the game will interpret "forwards" as run forwards. Sometimes it's walk forwards... You take two, three or four steps walking, and then you start to run.   When under fire, or doing a timed puzzle, this uncertainty is the main cause of death-reload cycles.\n\nNext, you've now got this little "standing jump", which you have to use in certain puzzles.  However if you use it too close to an edge (or even not!), when you jump, the game re-orients you in the air randomly.. I think it's to align with the edge you just left.   On curvy little round platforms, that means you often curve away from your intended landing spot, and plummet into the chasm.  There are two sections of this game where you have to standing-jump from tiny platform to tiny platform.  It was just a case of jump-die-reload-jump-die-reload........ until the game decides NOT to curve you away, so you save and repeat until at the far ledge.  Damn frustrating.  I ended up just using back-flips blindly in the hope of landing in the right spot (over and over again). because at least the backflip doesn't get curved by the game in mid-air.\n\nFighting is equally bad.  Shooting and flipping was a great tactic in TRs1->5.  If you try do a flip now: She has to crouch, jump, land, bend, straighten, move her feet apart, and fractionally lower her gun, before you can jump again.  Doing so makes for agonisingly stilted acrobatics.  Don't even think about trying to do two things at once (like back-up and take your gun out, which was a staple of previous TR games)..  Also, when fighting, gone is the wonderful "arms tracking enemy" in previous games (remember when lara dual-wielded, and her arms could track TWO enemies? That was AWESOME). Now Lara's whole body tracks the enemy, and 'locks on' and 'locks off' at random intervals... So you can be in a fight, running away, then suddenly BAM, you're pointing AT the enemy running towards them... You try to do a backflip, but for some reason the controls are now reversed, and you do a flip AT the enemy.  The fight with "Boaz" is one of the most frustrating fights: The stilted pauses between flips is slower than the enemy's blob-fire rate, so you're constantly being knocked down. Grrr.\n\nAll in all, this is definitely the weakest of the TR games.  I played it initially in the hope that I'd find out how she survived TR4 (which I didn't), and to move the story arc along (which it doesn't)... So all in all, a disappointing game.\n\nThe voice acting and music is standard TR fare, that is to say, excellent.  The level design itself is staid, but solid.  The monsters are interesting and different. It does introduce an interesting new character (future love interest?)..  So I can't say that it's ALL bad.\n\nThe Verdict: If you're a TR fan, sure, go ahead and play it.. It'll waste a good 10+ hours, and give you a bit more in the life of Lara.  Be prepared for frustration: Don't expect anything as polished as Chronicles, though.","August 25, 2014","true","61.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

What I hate about this game is the story. How did Lara survive? It is like a new story to Tomb Raider, not feeling like a sequel to Chronicles or The Last Reveleation. Not to mention the levels are crap, misleading puzzles sometimes. 7/10, needs a better story plot, better puzzles, no more copy and paste bull****. I recommend if you want more Old Lara Croft gameplay, get it, else if you want story, pass this.","November 15, 2014","true","15.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It was the first "smooth" graphics Tomb Raider game ever made, meaning no polygonic characters or blocky locations. The game had excellent detail on the characters as well as the locations. But great visuals don't lead to a great game, when the controls don't function right. Apparently this game was in production for a few years, and to have it be released at the same time as the second Tomb Raider movie "Cradle of Life" it was rushed into the gaming market without fixing the bugs or glitches. In the past, the only difficulty you deal with in the Tomb Raider games is the environment of the levels and the obstacle of traps and enemies. In this game, you are handicapped with limited controls, glitches, and a hanging meter every time you need to travel across a ravine or ledge by hanging off it with only your hands holding you up while going across. Had these issues been resolved this could of been a playable game. But I am unable to give it mercy when the game is frustrating in control wise and not level wise. I can understand what they were trying to do, they were attempting to experiment with new challenges, gameplay, and situations to differ from the older games. Which that is fine, I am open to new experiences for the Tomb Raider games but if you don't focus on the gameplay of the game no one will care about what those new experiences were. At the time this game was released, only three million copies got sold, and was cited as a market failure. It was such a disaster that it nixed the planned sequals to follow up and Core Design ended up ditching Tomb Raider which ended up in the ownership of Crystal Dynamics. I would love to of seen a follow up to this game, which was going to be titled "Tomb Raider: The Lost Dominion" which would of explained how Lara Croft escaped from the Temple of Horus as well as the fate of Kurtis Trent, who was an interesting character who became the first playable male protagnogist in a Tomb Raider game. But with the reputation this game has, I don't think we will ever see him in another Tomb Raider game again. Thus Angel of Darkness ended the first line of the Tomb Raider franchise and is if not the weakest game in the entire franchise. Lesson to be learn, never rush the prodcution of a game and be sure the controls don't suck.","June 22, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

BARELY.\n\nBut first, let me take you back to... uh... ages ago. I got this game free with a graphics card I bought way back when, I can't remember what brand it was, or what model it was even. Due to the age of this game it probably had 3dfx Glide. Does that get your dusty nostalgia senses going? Good.\n\nSo when I played this game... I knew it was bad. I was well versed in using the 'cursor keys' (as this game eloquently refers to the arrow keys as) at the time, so it wasn't a big deal. I'd played games which had that stupid as hell press left to turn left and press right to turn right and press forwards to go in the direction you are now facing system, so that wasn't too much of a big deal, but I can tell you it felt bad. The right mouse button to jump is what kills this game. I have no idea what LMB does, because of how quickly my latest playthrough of this game ended - but I'll get to that.\n\nI remember playing kind of deep into the game, or relatively deep. I got up to a nightclub or something, then I think I got to some sewers or something, where the game just started to crash ceaselessly every time I got up to a very specific door. All this time I was experiencing crashes, constantly. I had to go to a net cafe to go grab an update to the game, so I came back, installed that, and nothing changed. So, I gave up, I gave the game the finger, and moved on with my life.\n\nAnd that brings me to now.\n\nLeafing through my library, I found this. This ♥♥♥♥ing game.\n\nJust so I could give it a negative review, I opened it up. Because, hey, why not? I can say one thing, I'm very impressed with the options menu. Lots of good stuff in there. But... WHY OH GOD WHY, does my mouse, my keyboard, my headset, and a virtual something or other for my keyboard exist, and default to off?\n\nThis time around I really had no issues booting the game up. So that's nice, at least it works. I also didn't crash when loading into the game for the first time. But the incredibly crappy looking font on the loading screen in what is best described as bright neon blue betrayed what was coming up. Crappy controls, a very crappy looking Lara with what I swear is a bit of an outsize head, and... actually some pretty alright graphics. Nothing spectacular, but pretty good for 2003 I'd say.\n\nBut then there's the gameplay again. Every time you find something sort of not too bad, there's the gameplay. It's just not fun to play as Lara. It's not fast to play as Lara. It's also incredibly awkward. Again, you have to turn yourself around with left and right, before pressing up to go forwards. No WASD here. No moving around in all three dimensions seemlessly, no sir. You can also use the mouse to turn Lara, but this is just horrible, and it serves to make me feel like there's an invisible crosshair somewhere in front of you. It also just looks stupid.\n\nAnyway, I saw a dog. A dog chained to a wall next to a dumpster. Now, this I thought was truly unfair. What was this poor dog doing chained to a wall in an alleyway? Naturally, I approached the dog. The dog barked at me. But all dogs do that to strangers. Approaching the dog, I noticed how easily I could walk straight through him, clipping into his poorly rendered polygons without so much as a care. I fidgeted about with him phasing through my legs, as I wondered if I could even interact with this dog, as he seemed far more incorporeal than the extremely climbable dumpster I had climbed earlier, and which Lara had seen fit to remark on how it looked like it might be possible to climb it.\n\nAnd then Lara flopped over, ragdolled, with yet a small amount of health in her health bar, apparently dead, yet not dead enough to stop her from letting out a death cry.\n\nIn short, don't ♥♥♥♥ing play this game.","December 5, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

The game is litered with hints of greatnesss throughout, but sadly it really doesn't come together all too well.\n\n\nThe original games released during the PS1 era of consoles featured some light, simple storylines with a mix of puzzle solving, gun combat, and platforming.  This game attempted to add stealth, hand-to-hand combat, rpg/adventure game style npc interactions, and rpg character progression to the mix.  As some reviewers have pointed, all of these worked but felt tacked on and buggy in many cases.\n\n\nThe true highlight of the game is its story.  The first in the series to actually tell an engaging, provoking narrative that was intended to span at least 2 additional games.

One thing is certain; are you a Tomb Raider fan? Then buy it, maybe favorably on discount, like I did. But be prepared, because this game is easily the worst in the whole franchise. Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness was the first of the games on the PS2, which therefor dramatically revolutionized the graphics and gave a range of new possibilities. But the developers blew it. The game is unpolished big-time, and especially the controls (no matter how you set them up) is the worst of all the Tomb Raider games, and probably the worst you have ever tried in any game. The game had potential. They tried something new, with a darker theme - which is fine - but the unpolished state of the game is a major drawback.\n\nBottom line\nA must have for Tomb Raider fans.

For some reason unknown they decided to make Lara use only one gun! It's kind of disappointing. At the same time, when Lara is holding her gun, the camera changes by being further, trying to show her surroundings ""better"". But Lara's moviments when she is holding her gun goes crazy!  She doesn't walk normally. She makes little jumps, stepping back or forward, and she turns so slowly that sometimes it's better put the gun down on the holster and run to find a better spot to shoot.\nSome jumps in certain levels are buggy, Lara's health (or should I say life?) is more "delicate" in this game.\nAnother disappointing inovation for this game is the "strenght bar". It's so useless sometimes. Supposing that you went to the right place but you can't open it because she is not stronger already, you have to find something to push, break... to make her stronger -_- Unnecessary innovation for me.\nAnd now the good things: This game is entirely urban for saying. There are some excavation sites and hidden cave in certain parts on the game, but it's 95% urban. As I said on my analysis on TR5, I really like Tomb Raider's urban levels. Plus I love Lara's outfits in this game. In TR6, there's a highlight on Lara's eyeliner, to match the dark plot.\nSpeaking of plot, I really loved this one. I thought it was creative. I like to see how Lara is so angry in this game :) And a nice innovation (at least) was the opportunity to play with other character: Kurtis. I think he's a nice, mysterious interesting character. Too bad we don't have the chance to know more about him beyond we know in TR6.\nThere are some plot holes/unexplained details such ♥♥♥ "What really happened to Kurtis?" "What's the explanation for his Chirugai at the end?" "In some parts, "x" person was indeed the real person or it was Karel?" It's frustrating not to knowing all of this.\nIt IS a NICE game, if we analyze things separately. I wish I could play it in a remake but with the old school TR base.","February 14, 2015","true","36.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love all the Tomb Raider games, and this one is no different. The crazy and nonchalant story and the awesome enemies make the game what it is. Now yes, it has a lot of flaws, which can be explained by the early realease by the company (even before it was actually finished), pressured by the investors. And that sense of non-completion is palpable throughout all the game. The controls are the same as in TB4 (The last revelation) and TB5 (Chronicles) but somehow, although this is a newer game, they feel clunkier and less dynamic. Some enemies are really hard to kill (Boaz) and you don't always know what to do, but that is the signature move of this games, thou. Once you know your way around the creatures it is easy to bring them down (except for Boaz, that prick is a hard cookie), but in the way you may lose a lot of ammo and health. But, the save system actually saves you from that, if you're at least decent playing video games. One thing that did bothered me were the glitches and bugs scattered all over the place, but I can't blame the programmers for not having been allowed to actually finish the game and polish it. However, the graphics are pretty cool, considering the realease year and the rushed completion. They don't look like next gen of course but they have a nice rounded-shaped  form which doesn't make you believe that you're actually playing Minecraft. So, all in all, Tomb Raider 6 is an awesome (yet flawed) game that fans of the saga could enjoy, though it demands a lot of time and patience from the player.

Because of this there are bugs, incomplete sections and large gaps in the story. However, there is still much to be enjoyed about the story, atmosphere, audio and visuals, and this still remains as one of my favourite games of the series.\n\nHere' a more detailed insight:\n\nI've found the replay value of this game to be immense. Because of all the incomplete content, hidden areas, alternate routes and detailed environments you find something new upon every playthough. It's like exploring a beta product, which it basically is.\n\nThe graphics are amazing for their time (2003) and have aged well, however they need to be set up correctly before you start the game which can be confusing at first.\n\nThe soundtrack is excellent, with Peter Connelly and the London Symphony Orchestra working their magic. The main theme particularly stands out.\n\nThe story is more ambitious and engaging than any previous entry in the series. However there are patches that are completely missing due to cut chapters during the rushed release. This is especially clear at one point when Lara expresses familiarity with a character she has never met during the game.\n\nThe controls are different from previous games and can take some getting used to but in my opinion they actually make sense, and you may find yourself struggling to return to the old system after a lengthy play-through. Remapping may be required for keyboards lacking the number-pad. I also suggest you don't use the mouse.\n\nThe gameplay is slightly crippled by Core's last-minute decision to switch control methods, making the movement seem a little sluggish and dis-jointed at times. This can be frustrating at first but can be forgotten about over time. However the animations are realistic and smooth.\nDialogue options are available but for the most part are pointless or for comedy value.\nThe strength upgrade system is quite amusing; how Lara has to beat down doors etc. in order to “Feeel stronger” and be able to jump further. You may dislike this aspect of the game but some may see it as a more fun method of obtaining secrets. The stamina bar makes climbing a more stressful experience, having to make sure the bar doesn’t run out before you’ve reached your destination. Again, whether you like this or not comes down to personal preference.\nThere is also a very basic stealth system that doesn't seem fully incorporated. There are little to no opportunities to actually use it throughout the entire game. There are also hidden moves that Lara can perform including backflipping off ledges and pushing blocks using the Classic animation, but you'll have to find those out for yourself...\n\nIn addition to Lara you also get to play as Kurtis, who was supposed to have supernatural abilities for the player to control, and a spinning blade as a primary weapon. Unfortunately the only evidence of this now is in cutscenes, some of which are placeholders, making his gameplay significantly duller than it should have been.\n\nI recommend this game despite its many flaws. If you can keep an open mind and a sense of humour, give it a chance and you may be surprised/intruiged.","May 19, 2015","true","31.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

DO NOT play with the keyboard, it is pretty much torture, find a controller and play with that.\nBuuut, the game gets pretty boring sometimes, specially in the city bit, which may or may not take a lot of your gameplay time.\nThe game itself is querky and kinda of frustrating, but at the same time its fun and enjoyable.\nAlso, Lara is extremely dark in this game, just like the plot, which is more devilish and detectivesque, and that is a very different plot than the other ones.\nI just hoped that Eidos wouldnt had it rushed and left the game pretty much unfinished.\nI still like this game, it had a very cool impact in my childhood, in which at the time i didn´t know english, making this game impossible.

But is it a BAD game?\n\nI decided to find out for myself. I’d seen the reviews on Steam. I’d read articles devoted to explaining WHY this game was as bad as it is. If it turned out to be a bad game, I only had myself to blame. Still. I sat through the opening credits. Something I didn’t notice the first time was that the credits are presented like the opening of a movie, which does a really good job of setting up the atmosphere for the rest of the game.\n\nThe next part is – jarring – so much so that I nearly stopped playing then and there.\n\nLet’s take a step back for a moment. In ‘The Last Revelation’, Werner Von Croy was introduced as Lara’s estranged mentor, but by the end of the game, it seemed that whatever hostility existed between them had lifted. This was only further enforced by the events of ‘Chronicles’, the previous game to this one.\n\nSo when Lara suddenly HATES Von Croy and seemingly MURDERS him, it literally comes out of nowhere. To the game’s credit, this is actually a decent opening. Just really poorly timed.\n\nSo, after this shocking scene, you take control of Lara for the first time. This is where the game’s first issues are made apparent. The controls are WORSE than the Playstation games!\n\nDo the original games have bad controls? ANSWER: I don’t know. They’re so well refined that, once you get used to them, it’s near impossible to tell. Why then, with a control scheme so similar to the originals, can I say, with certainty, that the controls for ‘Angel of Darkness’ are bad? Maybe it’s the fact that you start at a S-L-O-W walk before you run? Perhaps it’s the twitchy turning (don’t worry Officer, I can walk in a straight zig-zag, just give me an hour).\n\nOverall though, the controls aren’t that bad | (To Be Continued in… Advanced Controls – Basic Combat).\n\nThe hub level ‘The Parisian Ghetto’ is where the game really begins. There’s a lot to do and a lot to interact with, including people! A first for the Tomb Raider series. The level of detail here is outstanding. While things do tend to move slowly during this part, it’s all carefully designed to support the story and introduce various characters. This is also the first time you have access to Von Croy’s Journal. In addition to acting as a Journal for Lara’s thoughts and objectives, the Journal also contains information and clues related to the story and future puzzle. In particular, these elements add a greater interaction and depth to the story than any previous Tomb Raider game.\n\nInteracting with the characters leads to a variety of quests that need to be accomplished, all of which lead to the best part of the entire game: ‘The Louvre’ and the ancient tomb beneath it.\n\nEverything from the Sewers beneath the Louvre to the end of Von Croy’s apartment is PHENOMENAL! The music, which was already good to begin with, gets even better, and perfectly matches the atmosphere of each level. The puzzles, though sometimes a bit linear, are excellent, polished, and masterfully executed. And the grand puzzle at the end is some of the best that Tomb Raider has to offer! The story was already proving to be very strong, but by the end of Von Croy’s Appartment, I was CONVINCED this was a good game (And then the Internet said, “Oh Yea?!” and everything turned to ♥♥♥♥).\n\nAs much as I would praise the first half of ‘Angel of Darkness’, it has its – obvious – rough edges.\n\nAdvanced Controls – Basic Combat: We tried. We couldn't make them worse.\n\nCombat is AWFUL! This is the first unforgivable sin of ‘Angel of Darkness’. And nowhere is this MORE apparent or frustrating than with the first boss.\n\nISSUE 1: It takes FOREVER to draw or holster a weapon. There’s nothing wrong with having somewhat of a delay. But when it feels like I could play three OTHER games in the time it takes… This is made FAR worse by the fact that the ‘holster weapon’ function is sometimes unresponsive. [Want to holster your weapon in a hurry? Please fill out this 500 page legal form. Oh, I’m sorry, we’ve rejected your request. We’re not going to give you a reason, but please reapply for weapon holstering at a later date. What, you’re DEAD?! …Please fill out the necessary paperwork for Save Game Reload…]\n\nISSUE 2: When in combat mode, you are ALWAYS facing your opponent. What makes this even WORSE than issue 1 is that if you want to move in any direction other than forward, you hop. The ONLY direction you can run in is TOWARDS THE ENEMY! No, this is NOT an Easter Egg, and Lara is NOT a Bunny!\n\nIn previous Tomb Raider games, combat wasn’t perfect. But the level of freedom and responsiveness made it a fun and versatile system. Here, combat is beyond restrictive! The first boss is a clever and creative puzzle boss, but the combat system transforms it into a hellish frustration.\n\nIf you manage to get through the unfortunate frustration of the first boss, the game rewards you with some AMAZING action sequences and a PERFECT closing to the first part of the game.\n\nIf you’re smart, you’ll stop playing at this point. I’m not saying that the second half doesn’t have interesting ideas, puzzles or story (it DOES or I could hate it more), but the execution is a DISASTER! The second unforgivable sin.\n\nRemember how you had to solve a HUGE non-linear puzzle and overcome a clever (if frustrating) boss to get the first ‘plot item’? A small puzzle room with two skeletons hides the second…\n\nRemember the amazingly detailed hub level with its various social puzzles and numerous quests? One person, one quest (though the quest IS decidedly cool).\n\nRemember that brilliant story that was perfectly paced, cleverly written, with interesting characters? Screw story! Let’s have the main villain kill off his lackeys because they looked at the moon the wrong way.\n\n…WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?!\n\nTo understand WHY the second half is so – underwhelming, it is necessary to look at the development history of this project.\n\nOriginally, ‘Angel of Darkness’ was conceived to take place over four different locations, making up four sections of the game, each as detailed and refined as the first. In order to meet deadlines, two sections were cut entirely. Personally, I think THIS more than anything DESTROYED the story. They should have cut the game in half and ended on a cliff-hanger.\n\nIn addition to development being under extreme time pressure, the second Tomb Raider movie was about to be released, and ‘Angel of Darkness’ was FORCED to be release in conjunction. This killed ANY chance of the second half receiving ANY sort of refinement.\n\nWhat makes this worse is that the second half is not devoid of good ideas or puzzles. The fish puzzle is actually quite clever! The fish AI is pathetic, so much so that you can easily bypass the fish without solving the puzzle. Worse still, I suspect this was meant to be a larger puzzle than what is present in the game.\n\nThe plants in the ‘Bio-Research Facility’ make that section the most beautiful in the entire game! In addition, the plants are designed to be traps! And were never used as anything but decoration.\n\nI’ve already mentioned how disappointing the puzzle for the second ‘plot item’ is. But the doorway leading to it is AMAZING!\n\nSo, is this a bad game? Yes.\n\nDespite that, I LOVED the first half of ‘Angel of Darkness’. I even loved parts of the second half! I wanted this to be a good game, but the second half was just too flawed.\n\nAs a fan of the Tomb Raider series, there’s enough positive elements that this game should not be overlooked.\n\nHowever, for the average gamer, I can not recommend this game.","November 15, 2015","false","22.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
