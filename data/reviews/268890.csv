Game execution not great. Anything more than $5-10 Game price: Not worth it. Now that I won it, I'll keep playing it, but it is really not as polished as it should be. I bought the add-ons. Examples: South Korea has a Vietnamese city called Saigon. US outstanding Debt is about half that of Germany. In reality US is about 17 trillion to Germany's 5-600 billion. The AI for war/conflicts is horrendously bad. Never leave the direction fo your troops to your general. Even when a country no longer exists your AI thinks the conflict is continuing. If a NATO member is attacked (i.e. Russian invasion of Poland), NATO doesn't mobilize. The number of interactions capable with leaders/advisors is extremely limited. Again, this is a great concept for a game. If it was polished and had more features I would rate it 4.5 out of 5 or higher. As it is right now it is like a 1.5 out of 5. The concept keeps you engaged, the gameplay doesn't. STRONGLY suggest you don't buy.","November 2, 2014","false","16.1"," 113 of 130 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","113","130","5","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElVlado/recommended/268890/","ElVlado","Sir Vladimir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElVlado/","238 products in account","This is my review of the game after being first scared off and close to not trying it. I enjoy it alot.\n\nThis is a Marvellous game for those people who are interested in Geopolitics, aren't looking for a quick Command and Conquer-styled game and enjoy running a simulated nation from top-down. It is important to emphasise that this is more of a simulator than a game. People who enjoyed Superpower 2 or are interested in a geo-political simulator will enjoy this game, but the game has a steep learning curve, and having an education helps.\n\nOverview\n\nMasters of the World - Geopolitical Simulator 3 is a simulator first and foremost. Whilst the simulator can be a game of tactics, it is much more than that. In this game, knowledge of the world and how government's run will help you understand how this simulator works. In the simulator you can play as any country in the world and run its affairs. The game has the nations as of 2013 and 2014, and the governments that run them with comical mimicks of the real-life leaders. Once you enter the simulator, you will have to face that country's problems head-on.\n\nThe game has 5 major areas: Politics, Economy, Military, Diplomacy and Trade. Each part is interesting and has different challenges and positives. You really need to balance each of them as each strain is interlinked with the other.\n\nPositives\n\nThere are heaps of positives in this game that make me enjoy it, but here are my favourite 3:\n\n- Depth of the simulator. The developers really made this so you have to think about the simular from an educated perspective. The simulator has 5 major areas has alot of you to go through, lots of details and statistics. For example, in the Economy you have to manage taxation, debts, budgets, and trade in order to make a better economy. Each of these are in even more depth, from tax on alcohol to organising trade contracts with different countries for profit, and to the economy split into Industry, Services, Agriculture, etc so as to represent your country's production. This is replicated in the areas of Politics, Military and Trade, but not really in the diplomacy field. You change these statisics by the actions you take.\n\n- Simulated world events. The news really gives you an overview of what is happening in the world. The simulator simulates the status of the world's economy, politics and wars and this is always interesting in my opinion. I find even protests within country's I control represent to me issues that the nation faces (welfare dependency, police numbers, etc). This is a very interesting dynamic to the game.\n\n- Cause and effect. Everything has cause and effect. For example, raising taxes makes more money but affects your popularity, the purchase power of your people, unemployment and other factors. Going to war can allow you to colonise, annex or integrate a country, but costs heaps of money (transporting soldiers, or sailing navies in reality isn't cheap!) and relies on positive public opinion.\n\nThere is much more, but those are my favourite three.\n\nNegatives\n\nThere is quite a few downsides to the game that need improvement. There has been alot of criticism for Double DRM in this game, but I never had any problems with it (as I can play it offline and no issues c/f Ubisoft games). Double DRM exists in heaps of games, where Steam protects the game from copying but the game producers also try to have it. This issue is a wide-ranging issue but I haven't had any issues with it. The other widely-criticised issue is only being allowed to install the game so many times. This isn't too much of an issue if you don't delete your games, and has been around for ages. If you have any problems, its been said that you just have to contact the company for remedy.\n\nTo be honest, much of the criticism of the game Re DRM and other hasn't been an issue at all for me. In terms of gameplay, here are the worst bits:\n\n- Learning Curve.One of the hardest things for people in this game is the learning curve. My first 7 games were tragedies, I was either assassinated, kicked out of government or fled overseas because my people hated me. This, if you read the other reviews, is why others have then rated this game badly. Just because you might play a few games and fail doesn't mean its unplayable, it means you need to understand things better.\n\nBut this difficulty, while a reflection of the reality of making difficult policy decisions, is also something that may scare some people off who just want a quick game.\n\n- Conflicts. Unlike other games, there are conflicts that erupt all the time across the globe. 90% of these conflicts are just skirmishes (North Korea bombing a South Korean island, city, etc) that doesn't erupt into a bigger war and stops at the skirmish. The other 10% is a major war, which results in either the colonisation/annexation/integration of another region, or a ceasefire. For example: I was in a big war besides USA, France, Mexico and Brazil v Venezuela. Venezuela blew up a US Nuclear Reactor on US islands in the Mediterranean. After much military manouvering and many failed US landings, 5 months later a ceasefire was signed.\n\nThis part of the game is 50/50. While it produces alot of fun to watch/be part of a war and brings a combat dynamic into the game most of the time, it can be quite tricky and doesn't really correctly simulate how often conflicts erupt.\n\n- Broadcasts. The game could do without it, but it adds a comical feature to the game. Events allow your leader or others to give you briefings, tell you about events, United Nations speeches, etc. This is fun to listen to your advisors/other world leaders, but can be a bit repetative. You can turn this off though.\n\n- UI. The Game's UI isn't very good. It is manageable, but because the game has alot of depth it can be difficult to easily switch from normal view to military view, to zoom in and to get the information you want on your screen quickly. It just takes a little more time and hence patience in my experience.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor a game made by indie developers, this is a great game. It is not made by a major developer, these guys have a small team but bring quite a big simulator that is overall enjoyable. Sure it isn't Europa Universalis 4, but it is a geo-politica simulator that does what in my opinion, is a good simulation. The geo-political simulator that is alot of fun,and very interesting It is especially enjoyable if you know your stuff (such as the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008, what made the Global Financial Crisis happen, what a tax actually is, etc etc). Definitely, coming from a university background, this game makes alot of sense and allows me to enjoy a global simulation where I can be any country. This game is more for the grand strategy gamer with some intellect, rather than the "where is my artillery and explosion" gamer.\n\nI came to this game very skeptical, and was close not to buying it. I read the negative Steam reviews and thought, well, why should I try it if its -so- bad? I contacted the developers and told them that I'm uncertain about the game. I decided to buy it and haven't regretted it as someone who is interested in geo-political issues and likes grand strategy games. As one of the original purchasers of Superpower 2, this game reflects the fun I had in that game.\n\nFurthermore, success in this game is in the eye of the beholder. One of my most successful games was playing as Australia, where I was able to make a budget surplus, and start to pay off my debt. With surplus I built stadiums, theatres, airports, and a larger army that I used to take over different Pacific islands and colonise them.\n\nOverall, I would give this game 8/10. Contact me if you have any questions :)\n\nIt isn't the best game out there, but in a limited market for these types of games its good.","April 3, 2014","true","46.9"," 98 of 129 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","98","129","2","0"

The gameplay can be enjoyable and interesting, and sometimes hilarious. However the reason I cannot recommend this game is simply because it is flooded with bugs and ambiguity. "Everyone is protesting your lax policy" - thats nice and all but wtf is a lax policy?\n\n"-1% popularity: Scientific Discovery" - why am I losing popularity for discoverying something and publishing it after it made everyone happy? And why is it happening repeatedly for 1 week?\n\n"¬£25Bn on Foreign Policy" - thats nice...how do I cut it? Where do I cut it? Can I even adjust it? The Foreign aid I give comes no where close so where is the rest cuz its going over budget by more than 15%\n\n\nAs for bugs, the game is riddled with them. Always has been. For instance, my AI general sends a tank to take a city, but my ally takes the city first. But my general REALLY wants that city so continues the attack. Boom. Instant war with my ally. UN hates me. EU hates me. My people hate me. I get diposed and start WW3. Thats just one really annoying bug which I have to reload to fix.\n\nIf Eversim had continued working on GPS3 and fixed bugs and actually responded to feedback, hell if there was a SINGLE update, I'd be able to recommend this game. But I don't recall any updates/bug fixes. Instead they released an "add-on" which allows you to mod the game. And an expansion which allows you to start in 2014. Then moved onto their next game, ignoring the player's woes, bugs and issues.\n\nIf you can accept the bugs, and get used to the ambiguity in the game, then I'd recommend it for aspiring politicians or people who just like to start world wars, or like long-lasting, complex micro-managing games (like me). Otherwise I cannot.","December 20, 2015","false","98.5"," 51 of 58 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","51","58","6","3"

Since political simulation games are a rare species, and this is one of the few of them, I normaly would recommend it to everyone who likes this type of games. You really have to work to have your plans work out, no matter if it's economic grow, demographics or military expansion. Especially the latter is hard to achieve, since you have to fight bad publicity both internationaly and intern. The gameplay is very deep and it's very challenging to achieve your goals.\n\nThe graphics are decent. Not good, not bad, but still enough for this type of game. As for sound, that's ok too. I dunno if it's a bug, but I hear the music of other games while playing this one (Distant Worlds).\n\nThe only reason why I don't recommend it is the simple fact that it has DRM. So you're not only limited to buy it on Steam here, but also have limited activations and... hell, I just hate DRM. Way to go, thank you Eversim. Unfortunatly I haven't read it, else I wouldn't have thought about buying it.\n\nSo, summerized:\n\nDecent Game, a little buggy, but fun. I'll give it a 7/10, because I like the genre and since this game is a rare specimen... and subtract 7 points for the DRM. That's 0/10 for you, until the DRM is patched out. As soon as that is done, I'll make a recommention.","February 9, 2014","false","6.2"," 64 of 82 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","64","82","0","4"

Besides basic graphical elements missing like mouse scrolling of the map, the economic modeling/decision making is aweful. Interest rates and trade contracts? Really? That's essentially it? Sure it's fun to buy essetentially useless tanks and power plants for a decade while you watch your economy/budget freefall every time. Even the IMF is unrealistic--as Turkey they forgave me 300m in debt just because I was running a budget surplus. Their message was basically here's your reward for balancing your budget...what? The IMF in reality will only forgive debt they know they're never get back anyway. If you can pay, they'll take every bit they can get.    Lastly, political instability is a joke. Playing as several African nations in sequence,  I was overthrown by the healthcare syndicate (WTF?!?,) forced out of office while I had 100% popularity, had two military coups, and was conquered by Ethliopia (granted playing a Somolia) ALL WITHIN THE FOR 30 DAYS OF GAMEPLAY!!!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/politicsgaming/recommended/268890/","politicsgaming","PoliticsGaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/politicsgaming/","77 products in account","I highly recommend this game for anyone who is a political geek.\n\nThe game is extremely in-depth. It goes from well-known laws like freedom of speech/demonstration/religion to tiny aspects you'd never see in a geopolitical simulator; blood toxicity level, driving age, maximum age for school, and speed limits on trunk roads, city roads, and highways. It also has a very realistic atmosphere to it. Setting aside the fact the map and characters look like 90s era games, it gives the game a feel no other geopolitical simulator has given me; realism. It goes from setting meetings with political figures and world leaders, to having small talk and influencing well-known figures in your country to vote for you or support your bill publicly. When a law doesn't pass through, a reform can be made. Adding laws into this reform that is bipartisan will increase the chances of it being passed. More features include asking nations for authorization to build a pipeline through their territory, building pipelines for oil or gas, detailed trade agreements that allow you to set the price, quantity, and duration of the agreement (Example: Russia's Natural Gas Agreement with China that will last for 20 years), the game also allows the construction of various buildings or transportations like oil and gas pipelines, high-speed trains, nuclear power plants, oil rigs, gas and oil fields, and even increasing the number of hospitals, homes, schools, or solar fields. The game also has a very complicated economic system. I have been having trouble with it, but I did have some success as Jordan earlier. Continuing on, the game is very recent. It isn't like SuperPower 2 where it was created just before the NATO expansion or the break-up of Serbia and Montenegro, but it was released in 2013, meaning it has the world's youngest country, South Sudan. The game features terrorist groups in every country, ranging from the Mafia to Total Jihad groups (Al-Quaeda). You have the options to infiltrate the groups if they live in your territory, to funding them with weapons, money, and 2 semi-trucks with rockets and explosives if they are in other countries to help them take down that country's government. But if you do this, you have the chance to be caught red-handed. And this will transfer into the news, and Parliment will impeach you. I suffered that while playing as Russia and funding New Zealand terrorists. The game offers so much detail to their options, like adding more medical staff and adding more police staff. You can also investigate politicians and well-known citizens to reveal a scandal to use against them, to spying on heads-of-state or countries to find evidence that will gain the approval of the United Nations Security Council and allow military action against the country. Which brings me to the Organizations of the game.\n\nThe game has made Organizations possible, which bring various or all world organizations into the game including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, European Union, and North American Free Trade Agreement. It then gives you the option to create your own Organization, allowing an Economic Market (NAFTA), Producing Countries (OPEC), Monetary Union (EU), and Political-Military Organization (NATO). This then allows you to choose members states, the budget, the voting system, the secretary general's holding of the seat, and who the secretary general is. You can then meet to set the prices of the product, make changes, etc. Like with OPEC, you can propose to change the average oil price. You can also launch reelection campaigns, even visiting the Olympics, military barracks, and universities. Instead of a SuperPower 2 style diplomatic relations, there are two types of relations. First is economic. Just because the country does not favor you does not affect trade relations. Second is military, allowing certian permissions like allowing air, ground, and naval bases in your/their country while considering the amount, allowing you to edit this at any time via meetings with head-of-state. Diplomatic relations come with various things, like managing embassies, allowing nationals to enter or leave, and forcing ethnic Israeli's living in Lebanon to return. Lastly, the game makes it perfectly with this.\n\nAs all military and geopolitical games have, the feature nuclear weapons. Naturally, this game has them. But for the first time, you need to go through politics when proceeding with a nuclear attack. First, you must authorize the use of nuclear weapons. Second, you must make a meeting with the Chief of the Army. Third, you must ask him to authorize the use of nuclear weapons. Forth, you must ask him for the code for the nuclear weapons. And the game never remembers it, You actually need to write it down. Lastly, enter your code when firing nuclear missiles. But in this game, it features something never seen in any game I have played - Chemical and bacteriological weapons. You can actually use the weapons hated internationally. Though it is almost difficult to use them, you need to have a high standing with the chief of the army. Authorize the use of chemical and bacteriological weapons, ask him to authorize their use, and if he allows it, you can freely launch chemical attacks against anyone. Beware - Using nuclear, chemical, and bacteriological weapons are EXTREMELY frowned upon domestically and internationally. If used, you will be thrown out of office, and if not that, the UNSC will send a resolution to authorize military intervention.\n\nOverall, the game is very fun. So far, I have not run into any major bugs like crashes or gameplay interventions. Only bug I have notices was on the Newspaper where it was supposed to say the President of Russia's name, but showed random lettering or coding. I rate it 8/10. If you love geo-political games and have major interests in politics, this game is perfect. Besides the 90s looking interface, no game has ever gone so in-depth. Many offical reviews say the same.","July 11, 2014","true","383.5"," 57 of 79 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","57","79","0","1"

And i've put a lot of hours into it, because the concept of the game is absolutely amazing. However I cannot give this a positive rating at this time. The game is riddled with bugs, sometimes game breaking. It could be a bug causing your country to go bankrupt, or maybe it'll cause you to have excessive inflation, or causes a breakdown in the correlation between the decisions you make and the ingame economics.\n\nInstead of fixing the game crippling bugs, the developers ignore all the issues and have created Geopolitical Simulator 4. Because they've done this instead of fixing their game (which should really be in beta release, not published as a completed game), It has caused this 'game' to not feel like a game.

I was wrong.

Hope that helps.\n\nFor the rest of you, we can go into a bt more depth. Starting with the positives, I was very impressed with the amount of detail the game goes into - from currency unions to closing the borders the game has plenty of option to sink you teeth into. Where you'll find yourself somewhat frustrated however, is that many of the options are actually 'non-options' depending on the political slant of your party.\n\nWhen you pick a nation, you are bound to the ruling party and it's politics and thus taking any nation with a clear bias toward the right or left of the political spectrum to the other side - or even the centre - appears to be very difficult. Aside from the effort it can take to push through policies in the face of rebellion within your own party, long term they can actually choose to oust you, regardless of your adherence to democratic principles or your level of popularity.\n\nIn my North Korea playthrough I discovered this the hard way. Despite the huge economic and social benefits of opening up the society and my unbelieveable 100% popularity rate, my party took me out and shot me at dawn with zero interference from my alleged millions of supporters.\n\nAny significant change, even seemingly for the better can trigger widespread and disruptive protests which don't seem to subside all that quickly, even if you begin to introduce reforms that are being requested.\n\nThe interface is clunky at best, the game is not remotely impressive graphically, the voice acting is very off - my North Korean health minister had the most amazing, broad Irish accent - and, in the English version at least, emails and newspaper articles can sometimes make no sense whatsoever.\n\nBUT, it is far from all bad. As stated above, you have a lot of options and can descend into dangerously geeky levels of play. aside from the rarer occasions when your actions trigger unbelieveable responses, the game is largely authentic feeling and your actions do have a satisfying weight to them. The ability to fight in real time, or even leave the nitty gritty to the competent military AI, is also very well executed and you have a great choice of options open to you upon victory, from annexation or colonisation of the defeated foe, to a regime change. Borders can be renegotiated and the espionage system is one of the best I've encountered.\n\nWhere this game is likely to excel though is in Multiplayer, the range of overt and covert actions you can take to destabilise, attack or prop-up your neighbours is truly wonderful and I suspect even more rewarding when the ally or opponent is a human being.\n\nThe raw data used for the core modelling seems pretty solid however, you can break the game and your own immersion from time to time so certainly do not expect the political modelling to be bulletproof.\n\nComprehensive modding support is built into the game and I would expect this to be where the biggest strides in improving the game will be made.\n\nIn summary, if you have friends to play against or a sincere passion for political simulators then this is worthwhile pick-up, but I urge everyone to wait for it to be on sale or you will feel more than a little taken advantage of. If you are a casual player or are considering this as an impule buy, I'd suggest giving it a wide bearth or picking up the excellent and polisihed, if far less detailed - Civilization IV or V.","March 1, 2014","true","11.8"," 31 of 49 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","31","49","0","0"

It is a lot of fun to play, but don't expect to take over other countries without repercussions.\n\nThe game is complex. Really, really complex. There's probably still a lot of things I don't know about the game. It goes real deep into just about every aspect there is to managing a modern-day country. The learning curve is insane. You'll need to spend a lot of time in the game just figuring out the various changes that can be made to your country in order to keep citizens happy, which is quite the difficult task.\n\nYour relations with other countries in the game can easily be severed if you choose to attack another country. This is not the type of game where you're able to just "conquer" countries. Doing so will result in the entire UN being against you. In fact, when I took over Georgia (I was playing as Russia at the time), South Korea called for military intervention from UN members.\n\nWhen voting came around for this, I voted against it, which prevented military intervention. How? Well, Russia is one of the five permanent member of the UN, so if they don't agree, then it gets vetoed automatically, even though EVERY OTHER COUNTRY voted for military intervention. I used this to my advantage and continued to take over two other countries before being executed by my own army in Moscow (oops!). Yeah, Russia's citizens were not happy with my actions, even with a 49% approval rating.\n\nMasters of the World is a really fun game. It's a fantastic experience and I highly recommend it, if you're willing to take it seriously.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x37HQuKSomo","February 18, 2014","true","3.3"," 24 of 37 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","24","37","2","0"

Of course strategic gaming must be your thing in order to fully appreciate MOW. It has more body than for example Civilization (which in itself is also a good game). It is very interesting to see what influence your various decisions have in the field of domestic or foreign policy, financial health, economic growth or social aspects.  Also the causal relations between investing/cutting in a particular sector, creating contracts, growth, unemployment, production, trade balance, budget deficit, privitization etc..etc.. is very realistic, interesting and entertaining. Fun to read the newspaper on which impact your various decisions have, how it is presented and how well it is received by public opinion. One of the things I have learned is that you certainly can't satisfy all of the people and organizations in a country. And most of the time it is a real challenge just to keep your head above the water. But all the more satisfying it is when you do manage to create a contract, see that the invested tax payer dollars create economic growth an jobs etc..etc..\nUntill now I played only USA and I noticed that you realy have to balance between containing the budget deficit, stimulating economic growth, your popularity rating and your dependence on congress which you will need in order to push foreward your policy. You come to understand and realize the dilemma's most leaders also must have in real life! Also, don't trust the republicans hahaha. If you for example ask the head of the republican party to support you on a bill in congress, he says he will do so, but instead they stabb you in the back once it is voted on (that is if they don't agree with the bill of course). All in all I am very enthousiastic about this game.\nIf I had to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, I would say 11.","February 20, 2014","true","150.2"," 34 of 56 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","34","56","0","0"

It's riddled with bugs. The "help" files are links to Wikipedia pages about real life (if you don't crash). There are a number of screens and windows that require obscure workarounds to even operate, and often "forget" the things you've done. Windows you're working in randomly close. Values randomly change. Other world leaders offer you contracts that they can't fulfill, and reject the contract after you accept it. Notices from advisors are substanceless and repetitive - they do not have dialogue options that are meaningful, and you are still left with just as much information as you had before. There is no history of your actions, or previous values for anything. Some screens won't even display the correct current values. You cannot expedite the passing of laws even in the worst autocratic nations, and people will revolt while it's being passed for three weeks.\n\nThis game is a J-O-K-E. If it were implemented in a spreadsheet instead, and free, I might play it at work for like five minutes or so. This is awful and I want my money back because the developer doesn't deserve it. This isn't even something one department or a couple of people could be responsible for. It takes the fail of multiple departments to create something this bad, and then charge $50 for it. They probably also fired the few competent people they did have working there, just before they realized they did still need them.\n\nOther things you can do with $50:\nDinner and drinks for yourself and a date <3\nOrder pizza for a large group of friends\nBuy three or four better indie games\nPay your internet bill\nSend your mother flowers\nMovie tickets for four\nDrive to Denver and back\nBuy a mouse that lists the amount of DPI on the box in bold letters because it has the most of them\n...\n\nDo you see what you've taken?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirLagsalott/recommended/268890/","SirLagsalott","SirLagsalott","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirLagsalott/","116 products in account","At first, Masters of the World looks like a deep, engaging and thrilling simulator of worldwide politics. If you made the same mistake that I did by purchasing the $70 bundle with the game, updated content, and the modding tool, you'd better hurry and refund that. If you really want to see what this game has to offer then you should just buy the base game.\n\nUnfortunately, the problems with MotW appear immediately. Right off the bat, the tutorial was unable to figure out that I had successfully changed some spending priorities as it had instructed me to, preventing me from progressing further. Armed only with the knowledge of how to navigate the map and modify the budget, I tried to start a new game. It was extremely difficult selecting a leader that wasn't of the same party as the current leader, turning the start-up process into a mess as I accidentally changed unrelated settings attempting to figure out how to change the leader. I eventually figured it out - though I can't even remember how I did - and entered the game.\n\nImmediately, the game became campy and even amusing. To communicate to the player even basic messages, an ugly and poorly-rendered person takes over your screen to talk to you about how well you're doing. The voice acting was so robotic and unnatural, the first 7 hours I played I was certain it was just a text-to-speech software. These messages quickly become repetitive: whenever there is a terrorist cell in a foreign country, someone will come on the screen and deliver a useless, rambling explanation of the "Brown model" without giving you any real information (they'll mention percentages and numbers that sound important, but turn out to be repetitive filler that doesn't change situation to situation). Afterwords the game will give you a static text box telling you the real information: where the cell is, what it does and how to contact them. You can skip these messages (and thankfully by doing so you're not actually missing anything), but the fact that Eversim put so much effort into something so unnecessary - and in fact something that hinders the gameplay experience - shows where their priorities are.\n\nThe rest of the game's graphics do not fare well, either. The game has extreme and severe lag somehow, even when countries are basically trees, lakes, and geometrically simple cities that consist of about a dozen buildings. As mentioned earlier, the character models look horrendous, but the developers seem to enjoy showing off. The interface is a problem (which is not uncommon for an Eversim game), with the developers trying to make fancy-looking infographics hidden behind dozens of menus and tabs.\n\nIf these problems weren't major enough, the game is buggy, crashes very often, and Eversim has completely given up on it. Eversim has a history of spending about 6 months on a political game, updating it rarely for a 6-month period, and then disappearing to work on a sequel. Their sequel to this game is coming out soon (the release date has already passed with no announcement) and judging by the trailers, it preserves the terrible graphics and confusing interface. If Eversim settled on a game, kept updating it, used a reasonable price, and actually made a working tutorial, they wouldn't have a 42% positive score on Steam.","June 3","false","7.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I am having to ask steam for a refund and a CLEAR WARNING to people that this game may litteraly be un playable, hell, now that i am thinking of it, i paid $54 for a 30 second video as the trailer is the most i see of this thing. now, obviously, i cant tell you to not buy the game as it is your decision, but i do ask this, do you want to risk your hard earned cash on a 30 second video? that is what you need to ask yourself. now in the case i dont get a refund, one of these ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s will need to expect a lawsuit, because you can bet your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• one will be headed to one of these companys. so, please, dont be me, dont waste near $60 on a 30 second video. i have seen people say infeastation survivor stories is a scam and dont buy it, but how much is it, like $4.99? and that damn game was at least playable. like i said i paid close to the price of a brand new triple a game, only to recieve a 30 second video. i am ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, and before any of you hound me about your game being playable, just know that i have done everything to try and fix it, and yes i even downloaded that damn xvid.org thing. so, to sum it up, this is in my case and other cases, a full blown scam, and yes other cases, i googled it to see if there was a fix, but nope just a lot of people complaining about this issue to the devs, and the devs do nothing, i have seen and heard people say, try turning off fullscreen mode, and i have tried this, it makes no difference for me and many others. so, to sum it up in one word, scam. but like i said its up to you to decide what to do, but my advice, dont do what i did, dont ignore the bad reviews. if you want to support this company (Eversim) i can recommend Rulers of Nations. thats the whole reason i got my self in this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed up situation, i really enjoy rulers of nations, and wanted to support the company buy buying a game, not a damn video that i can youtube for free.\n\n\nEdit: The 1 hour of :Game time is me trying it over and over. still nothing...\n\nEdit #2: after Uninstalling and Reinstalling, i am now getting this error: Internal error 00000005\n\nEdit #3: even the devs dont support their game, i am having this issue and have contacted the support from their own site but my email cant go to that address. this "Game" is complete ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.\n\nEdit 4 final edit: this is the email i got finally, i had to use this email to get my money back.

I looked through the community discussions only to find that I was not the only one with the problem and it was fairly common and even after contacting steam support we found no solution.

Finally started to play it and it's laggy as hell - despite reducing all graphics options it still takes far too long for clicking something to work. I'm running with an i7 , 16gb ram,  1 gb graphics.\n\nLooking past the lag and auto crashing, playing the game feels like playing the lottery. Make a few decisions, see the consequences - but regardless of the consequence, get no practical feedback on why that was the consequence. So you can't even play a few times and learn, you literally have to play with a debugging hat on, logically using powers of deduction to eventually understand the consequence. E.G. "You got expelled from the EU because of your policy". What policy, I'd changed a few. So restart... change one less... expelled. restart, change another less... expelled. Finally figure it out...\n\nThe game is tedious, has great potential, but given lack of active community (compared to any paradox game) resolution of the bugs doesn't feel promising enough to spend more time playing.","October 13, 2014","false","9.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

For example, how boring it gets. You basically manage the economy forever, with the sole focus on getting constantly re-elected, if an ally or neighbour goes to war and you go to right them the world, including your country goes batshit crazy for being at war. Not to mention they will NEVER peace out normally even after the original 2 have peaced.\nThe combat is very clunky and, I must say just plain annoying to manage, not because its complex or indepth, its just simply annoying. You have cities and military bases around your entire country they you have to individually draw troops from, [Countries like China are... lets not go there.] You can leave the A.I to command you army of course, but they send in single units at a time in a long line that die every time they hit an inch of the enemy territory and are wiped out one by one.\nThe Economic and country managment part of the game is pretty fun, although the lack of tooltips are sometimes frusterating, it would be nice to know effects or other such anquities if you are new to the game or don't know all the political terms.\nAll in all, the game starts to get very repetitive, Economy - Elections - Economy - Elections -National disaster, [All the disasters do, you literally throw money at it and the problem dissapears] then maybe - war - [in which you are demonized even for defending an ally country, in which they will never peace out of]\nNot to mention! After all the gameplay spoofs, it has DOUBLE DRM, which the Dev's don't care that we don't like it, They do it anyway.\nDRM, poor combat, clunky A.I, Boring gameplay after an hour, 4/10\nWait for sale, or do not get.\nEDIT:: I also forgot about the crashes, 3 crashes in an hour which is ridiclious to!","November 29, 2014","false","6.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
