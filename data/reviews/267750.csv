"http://steamcommunity.com/id/savaze/recommended/267750/","savaze","savaze","http://steamcommunity.com/id/savaze/","489 products in account","I have mixed feelings on this game. I love Shadowrun (it’s an rpg), but this is an xcom-lite tactical game with a Shadowrun theme. The big question: ‘is it fun and worth the sticker price?’ Yes its fun, but that might be my Shadowrun allegiance speaking. I don’t think it’s worth the sticker price, due to the lack of replayability and the stale co-op. There are better and cheaper tactical games out there, and for that matter, Shadowrun games as well. SR Chronicles has no offline single player mode, and had a horrible rollout because of it. I wrote two other reviews before this and the devs asked me to reevaluate each time, so I’ve put in more than a hundred hours playing multiple characters start to finish getting a good feel for the game. I’d pass on this game for a couple of months in hopes that they get their act together; even then this should only be a $15-20 game.\n\nLikes:\n-The community\n-The graphics in the tactical map\n-The music: Mass Effect 1 meets the original Shadowrun '93 game\n-The theme\n\nGripes:\n-Thumbnailed character portrait at creation.\n-Character names aren’t unique – I’ve been in matches that had multiple people with the same name.\n-I've had up to 8 people stuck in a party, which can only handle 4, and we all had to restart the game to get a mission to work.\n-Broken character clothing as loot, with no way to sell the 20+ pairs of blue jeans, etc.\n-Skills/gear max about midway through the game, making the skills kinda boring.\n-No magical counterpart to cyberware – initiation would be nice.\n-Low essence cyberware is no longer available midway through the game, so if you install something early on that you don’t like later on, you’re potentially stuck with it (if you already have 3/4 slots filed).\n-Lack of variety in music.\n-Voice acting is flat - tone is always the same, so in combat people won’t sound frantic, or are overly bubbly, etc.\n-Many missions share the same maps, and in many cases you start and finish in the same spot.\n-Graffiti seems a bit bubblegum and usually looks like it was done with a giant sharpie marker.\n-Character conversations in the hub: low-res character models, terrain that normally looks good, but is zoomed in so much it becomes a pixilated mess. To top it off the objects in the setting are high-resolution.\n- Occasionally when you kill someone they’ll become obnoxiously clipped to their gear as it rolls away (most notably flamethrower users).\n-There needs to be a message system for the in-game friends list to make sense.\n-Co-op needs an initiative log or something along those lines to fix the cache click problem – so you don't worry about attacking the same guy or moving on top of each other, stealing each others melee kills, and potentially losing multiple turns to actions you didn't know you took (I frequently lost 1 or 2 turns this way, but I've lost as many as 4).\n-Co-op incentive just isn’t there: If you get together with all your friends and try to run through together it’s fun-ish (but needs voice chat to coordinate), but you really can’t play with anyone else in the interim unless you want to continuously go through the same levels. If you get left behind, trying to co-op with your now higher level friends is even more difficult, because you could be stuck doing 3-6 damage while the guys you’re with are doing 20+ and they are sporting 20+ points of armor and 3x your hp, making you a flimsy target that can’t get better gear and is only getting a fraction of the karma. While your group may go back and redo all the missions to catch you up the rewards make it more like grinding for the sake of grinding.\n-If you run this game solo the npc’s only come with a single skill and sometimes their skills will unlevel between missions, and they don’t otherwise keep good pace with the karma level of the story.\n\nThe devs have already drastically changed how the game was balanced since it released (abilities, damage, etc), and this is a game coming out of early access. They have whole portions of the game that aren’t even developed yet, that are part of the core game. The bugs are frequent and atrocious. You’ll find yourself having to logout of the game every few runs. Set pieces in the background will attach to the foreground, and trolls horns will disconnect and float in the next square over. Uncontrollable screen spinning is also a problem every now and again, as well as broken cursors. Critical hits will often cause the screen to zoon into the backside of a wall, instead of on the action. Frequently the End Turn button will disappear or move somewhere else on the screen. I think my biggest gripe is that the ability buttons don’t have enough of a click box (or it changes randomly) and when you go to click an ability you instead move to the space below the ability box. There are so many bugs that it’s not uncommon to run into people grumbling about something that should have worked (e.g. over 100% chance to succeed at a skill only to fail). If early access was closed beta, then the release is open beta. This is not a completed game and from day-to-day you wonder when they will reset your skills and what major nerf or tweak is going to happen next. All games get rebalancing, but this game gets totally retooled every time a patch comes out, especially with things like pets being added before fixing the bugs, making you feel like the devs still don’t know where they wanna go with it.","May 23, 2015","false","192.3"," 317 of 364 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","317","364","3","19"

While not a bad thing in itself, I did expect their own take on the Shadowrun title. After hours of playing Shadowrun Chronicles, it seem the games from each developer share little in common other than the Shadowrun universe. So I make the opinion of if you wanted another Shadowrun Returns/Dragonfall, you should wait for Hongkong otherwise you'e getting a more action oriented Shadowrun with a linear story. It's not exactly worth its price tag right now.\n\nChronicles is a stripped down version of Shadowrun Returns in almost every aspect. What I can say about the story is that they released the first chapter for the game and I think it is somewhat bare bones. The chapter has set up a pretty good premise with a decent plot revolving around a mysterious infliction and a dragon. Unfortunately I believe it falls flat on developing any good antagonists or story companions at all. What pieces of characterizing is through nodes you click on and read while doing a mission, which seems lazy to me. What I also feel I need to say is that there are no dialogue options at all. There's little to no decision making throughout the game so replay value relies solely on trying out different character play styles.\n\nThere is a hub of npcs like Shadowrun Return, which they're placed just as merchants, offer main quests and side quests or adding a small amount of context to the world. Currently, there is one major hub for the game and you don't really travel beyond that. Perhaps we will able to travel to different locations in future content.\n\nWhat is different is that the game is unlike its predecessor is fully online. Meaning you are playing on server and requires to have an internet connection. It also means that if the server is lagging, there will be time delay in your actions in and out of a mission.\n\nThe real divergence is in the skill system. There are no attribute scores like Shadowrun Return of any sort instead skills are packaged into different sections: Mind, Body, Blade, Blunt, Hacking, Rigger, Pistol, Automactic, Shotgun, Spellcasting and Summoning. You invest skill points or Karma into these skill sections. Investing point grant abilities and passives of sorts. There are some synergy between abilties and passives, but not much depth to it. It seems right now there is no cap limit to amount of karma you can earn, but there is no way to get a refund on your karma or respec unfortunately.\n\nI want to mention that there is no matrix combat in this game. Hacking is now apart of other "unlocking" abilites (Organ Harvesting, Picking Locking and Demolition) that allows you to open doors to loot random items while doing a mission. Also there is only right now a very crude character stats page showing only what tier of skills you invested, but no details in what your hit percentage, critical strike, and such.\n\nThe combat is where the meat of the game is. It's a turn base strategy game with usually four teammates. These characters can be henchmen of your choosing from a random list of mooks. who are not customizable at all.  It can also be someone you can invite a player from either a friend list or out of the chat channels. Unfortunately, there is no quick start or looking for group system in the game making it not so much user friendly for those who are shy or whatnot.\n\nThe gameplay itself is often described to be similar to XCOM games where your characters are relatively fragile and getting hit by anything can be lethal or at least very damaging. So the game revolves around getting your character into a good placement to flank or take cover from your enemies. I like mention there is no types of cover in this game such light, medium or heavy cover. It just cover now.\n\nThe enemy AI is pretty solid in that they'll try to on the most part get into cover and flank. Also they will try to focus fire, which can be good and bad.\n\nThe missions themselves get rather repetitive and bland as you go along. It so far consists mostly eliminating all enemies or defending an area or character with some minor nuances. The same could be said about mission environment as you sometimes play the same map with different objective at times. As for enemies variety is pretty decent in what you fight as you progress with occasional boss fight.\n\nSince this game is considered a "MMO" or Massive Multiplayer Online and with that end game content should be discussed. As of right now, there's literally none. You cannot do anything after finishing the chapter, but you can join other player's story progress to garner more karma. Making end game content into a grind fest of sorts. Cliffhanger have announced they are going to release end game content soon though.\n\nWhat is missing though, if you have played XCOM or other Shadowrun games, is Overwatch. Overwatch allows you act against any enemy that enter your view range. It is considered to be one of the key elements for this genre that helps your charactes from being rushed by the enemy.\n\nWhat I wish it had as well is cover/environment destruction like in XCOM. It has little to none of it this game, which was rather disappointing in hindsight. I believe it would made battles more dynamic and more complex than its simple current form.\n\nBottomline is that there is more work to be done for Shadowrun Chroncicle if it going to be more of an action packed game. In its current state is a very mediocre game that like other co op games gets somewhat better if played with a chummer or a friendly community player. I feel so far I have not gotten my money worth out of the game so I am inclined to not recommend it right now.","May 1, 2015","false","182.2"," 274 of 342 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","274","342","2","18"

But it suffers from some extreme problems, and is ultimately not very fun. The devs are having trouble with fixing some of these issues due to the way the game is coded, and it's creating some various serious problems for a small portion of their player base (like me).\n\nAll in all, it's a great idea that's ruined by poor planning and it's just not very fun. You'll see all this game has to offer in the first 10-15 hours, and then you'll repeat that same 1-trick poney 100 more times over the next 100-200 hours needed to get a character that is actually capable of doing the end game content.\n\nIf you do decide to buy this game, do your homework before you make a character. Certain aspects of character creation can permenently make your character garbage at end game AND some of the weapon skills are DRASTICALLY underpowered (with no proper balance changes in sight, due mostly to technical limitations). So don't end up sinking 50-60 hours into the game like I did only to find out that your character is completely worthless at end game and if you want to be useful/have fun, you need to start over again from scratch.","October 31, 2015","false","59.6"," 163 of 200 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","163","200","5","6"

Oh Wow.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/esturk/","215 products in account","Shadowrun Chronicles is essentially just a cyberpunk MMO someone slapped a Shadowrun sticker on.  Truth be told I got it on sale for a mere $12 or so, and honestly I feel that's probably a fair price for what I did get.  It's playable, I can see myself sinking some time into it just to get a turn-based squad combat fix.\n\nThe game itself is extremely linear, you have no dialogue options which kills immersion.  Playing a Summoning character, it baffles me that any time an NPC mentions something magic related my character responds like he's never summoned a spirit in his life.\n\nOn top of that skill trees are treated less like Shadowrun build options and more like shoe-horned generic MMO.  For example, my character is a summoner.  I can summon a bear... that's my only option.  In a true shadowrun game i'd be summoning all manner of spirits.  I'd also not be a 'Summoner' I'd be either a mage or shaman who also summon spirits, not so much here.\n\nBasically everything that the Shadowrun Returns series has done absolutely correct the team behind Shadowrun Chronicles has decided to not do at all.\n\nMy suggesiton? If you haven't purchased Shadowrun Returns, Dragonfall, or Hong Kong, use your money for those.  They'll give you a more genuine Shadowrun experience.\n\nIf you want a game where the developers clearly didn't know anything about the Shadowrun universe... go with this game and you too can own an Ares Predator pistol with an ammo capacity of 4...","November 28, 2015","false","3.0"," 73 of 90 people (81%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","81","73","90","9","0"

The development team has shown a hell of a lot of love to this game to beat it into its current shape, and while it's still rough around the edges, in another year or so, this could really be the definitive Shadowrun experience.\n\nThe combat plays like a simplified version of Shadowrun Returns, isometric (but 3D modeled!) turn-based. There's no overwatch, and the action system is much simpler-- essentially, you can move and shoot each turn, or move double the range and give up your attack. The combat's simplicity is actually one of its strengths, really; it feels fast and relatively fluid, and the combat is pleasantly lethal without being overwhelming. It also has a random cinematic camera which activates rarely and is always a pleasant surprise-- it really shows off how pretty of a game this is.\n\nHowever, this is a very opaque game. That description of the action system was determined through trial and error, and there are a few VERY frustrating interface bugs that make it even harder to tell what's going on. Why did a '-4' pop up over my drone yet it didn't lose HP? Why does my entire team's actions look like they reset when I summon a spirit? Why does taking cover increase an enemy's resistance to technological effects, despite it saying it doesn't use line of sight? Why does clicking during a cutscene not skip it and instead move me to that point on the map (almost invariably out into fire)? This is not the sort of opaqueness that encourages exploration and discovery-- combat just becomes confusing and frustrating because I can't tell what's going on.\n\nIf you really loved Dragonfall and you still can't get your fix, this is now a solid option. In another year or so, I really hope I can recommend this wholeheartedly.","March 31, 2014","false","3.4"," 342 of 509 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","342","509","0","25"

The game has lost a considerable amount of steam and it's not always easy to find a group to jive with you. Before you purchase check the charts http://steamcharts.com/app/267750#3m. Also the new content apparently is difficult enough to make the old crowd reluctant to play with people who don't regrind lower level missions until they have very high stats. My girlfriend and I came back after finishing the game to play the challenge missions. Even though we had enough stats to finish the game we could not find a group to accept us for the challenge missions because we had not spent time replaying the previous missions for more karma.\n\nThis is a rough gem but it’s still a gem. There are scant few cooperative turn based strategy games out there. In many ways it reminds me of playing the old Hero Quest™ board game from my youth but with a dash of the original Guild Wars™ and a whole lot of Shadowrun to top it off.\n\nLike in Shadowrun this isn’t going to be some cakewalk co-op game. You will need to use cover, time combos, and carefully consider your routes through the levels. But planning your route is enjoyable because the environments are easy to read and detailed enough to convey the atmosphere. Your abilities even cause car alarms and windows to shatter. Unlike most tactical games session length is nice and short. You can hop on, hit the global chat, and be in a game and done within a half an hour, or less.\n\nAll that being said this game does have issues. Many of the game mechanics do not reflect the Shadowrun setting well. Mages use mana, there is party limit for drones and spirits, and a quick hack can drop a person dead. All games can lag but when this game does it especially drags down the experience. A team of four gets eight inputs a turn. If every input had a five second lag that would be 40 seconds lost just waiting per turn. It very quickly adds up to tens of minutes just waiting for input lag. For a cooperative multiplayer game there are conspicuous number of features missing for a game that has finished beta. For example you can’t whisper to people, there is no group finder tool, and there isn’t even a list of hotkeys or controls.\n\nOverall though I think this game has a certain charm about it. Like playing a quick board game with friends and then saying “drek” when the dice go bad. At it’s current price of $29.99 it is a little steep but worth it considering it just released, and definitely worth it if you can find it at $19.99. If you like Shadowrun, you like turn based strategy, and you like co-op this is worth checking out.","May 4, 2015","true","71.2"," 78 of 104 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","78","104","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198154025830/recommended/267750/","76561198154025830","Tohibii","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198154025830/","141 products in account","This is a top down 3-D, RPG-LITE, turn based tactical game with short, combat-oriented missions. The game design decisions are built around the idea of quick play for Co-Op: from the UI, to the tactical choices to the repercussions for individual actions, everything converges to generate a combat-focused fast-play experience by turn-based standards.\n\nRPG or Tactical?\nAs something of a hybrid Tactical-RPG title, I would say its leaning markedly towards the tactical end of the spectrum. If you’re coming in expecting a full-blown RPG with a dynamic interactive story, you’ll likely be disappointed, as the efforts of the developers is more oriented towards generating a dynamic tactical game with high replay value on their content (ie. mostly gratuitous gun-fights with bodies dropping all around). The story telling emphasis has increased markedly with the latest April updates, so while it's not a branching story with player choices altering the narrative, it does have a good plot and a good immersion with a large number of NPCs to interact with (and mixed but overall very good voice acting mixed in too).\n\nCharacter Building\nCharacter creation is also more like a richer version of a tactical squad based game than a full-blown RPG. Everything is skill tree oriented, and its like a much larger X-Com mechanism with a linear progression down each tree and many of the progressions offering “this or that” choices. Characters can have two weapon trees active, plus two trees filled with passive abilities, which in many cases are kinda like what attributes would do in a traditional RPG system.\n\nIt seems implicit that they first decided on the combat mechanics and then built the character skills and abilities while trying to keep things balanced, like you’d expect in a tactical game. It was not designed to cater to people who bought the game so that they can build a very specific sort of mage or what have you, so everyone would do well to know that before purchase.\n\nVisual customization of your character is all about a wide and ever growing wardrobe of exotic fineries and sultry rags. Its still a work in progress, but it's extensive now and will continue to get expanded upon post launch.\n\nCombat\nThis is really the strength of the game. As noted, the core philosophy is quick play, and this has come together very nicely with game mechanics that generate decisive results off of single actions. What does that mean? Well, good shots with a clear line of sight or done with melee weapons have a VERY high chance to hit. Likewise, getting hit does a LOT of damage in relation to most characters ability to take damage. Things are quite furious here, so its basically the opposite from the Shadowrun Returns attritional combat model where firefights drag out and sometimes see characters get hit with an assault rifle and it degrading their hit points by 8% in extreme situations. Conversely, targets that are buttoned up behind cover have a much lower chance to hit, so you're really encouraged to use sound tactics and maneuver.\n\nThere’s also interesting dynamics with a rock-paper-scissors aspect based on physical-tech-magic damage and armor, some targets being extremely vulnerable to one, but immune or resistant to another (physical damage being the ‘safe but doesn’t open vulnerabilities’ option). There’s also a marking system where deckers and magic users can “mark” a target that opens up the abilities for other team members attacks.\n\nI personally would endorse the AI as being respectable as well. The melee based enemies are aggressive and generally just try and bum-rush you, while the missile enemies play it much more conservatively and use cover. While there are the occasional bad moves, they generally put together a coherent strategy with the more purely missile oriented forces I've seen in the game really trying to probe around my flanks.\n\nMultiplayer or Singleplayer?\nYou can play either way. There’s 4 player Co-Op, but you can also easily play single-player by running the whole team yourself (your main character and 3 Henchmen). Co-Op is REALLY fast as everyone is allowed to move right when the player turn starts - when one person initiates a move, everyone freezes while that's finished, but there's no waiting on someone else unless they're the last person to move that turn. Get with a team that knows what they're doing and its maybe 30 second turns - very fast pace for turn based! It takes a whole different tactical approach and I found myself fairly terrible at it after being used to controlling the whole team, but all the mechanics come together beautifully to keep the game moving.\n\nThere’s also global chat and I’d say its generally quite friendly, as we might expect in a game that’s currently Co-Op oriented.\n\nThere isn't PVP yet, but they’re working on it, though deathmatch style PVP between mature runners probably isn’t coming anytime soon (major balancing issues there with the high end PVE abilities, stun combos and so on). However, one of the ideas is to have asymmetrical PVP where one set of players takes the runners and the other controls the Gang or Corporate troops. The other option is for an “Urban Brawl” with set teams of combatants without the high end abilities/kit. Not sure when this will be implemented.\n\nBugs\nOverall this is quite stable for me on a Mac. A new update can see problems but they get sorted quickly enough, with most bugs being more of the nuisance variety rather than CTD type stuff.\n\nFuture Content\nOne thing to keep in mind with SRC is that launch isn't launch in the way that a singeplayer game is. Its a pay once to play business model, but they're planning ongoing content updates for free combined with quarterly DLC, so development is ongoing in the style of Online games. So, expect lots of changes from the features offered, the game balancing and so on.\n\nApparently new squad building mechanics are on the short list of features with the NPC Henchmen runners, which will add a lot for single player runs (or runs with 2 players with each controlling a single henchman).\n\nOverall\nWhether or not this is a good purchase for you really just comes down to the preferences of the individual here and your expectations. You’ve got a number of things that are well developed or emphasized and then a number of things that RPG fans would be disappointed not to see (and if its something that's going to really slow the gameplay down, it might not ever make it into this Co-Op focused game).\n\nSRC offers a unique package of turn based Co-Op (that can easily be played singleplayer) with brutal fast play firefights that still have that heroic feeling of "I'm gonna rush in there with my Katana". The story and atmosphere have improved by leaps and bounds this April, so you've got a good context to draw you in too. So long as you're not looking for a pure RPG experience, I feel confident to give SRC a solid recommendation as the 15-30 minute gunfights are great fun with a seriously addictive quality.","February 13, 2015","true","241.2"," 61 of 84 people (73%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","73","61","84","7","0"

Don't even touch it. Seven months into Early Access (which was released a year late) after a half million in kickstarter (for a game made on a free engine) with money from two different backers, and it looks like they've managed to make something resembling an isometric tactical game. I wouldn't say an isometric RPG, because that would require there to be important decisions the player could make. In fact, you can't even really call it a tactical game. It's an isometric thing where you put your people behind cover and shoot at things until whoever has less shooting power explodes.\n\nPlay Shadowrun Returns instead.","October 9, 2014","false","4.6"," 122 of 186 people (66%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","66","122","186","6","3"

I think 6 months from release date is time enough.\n\nFirst, I would definitely give Cliffhanger a thumbs up for sticking with the game despite the bankruptcy, the game changes from its Kickstarter inceptions, the VERY rough launch and disruption of other IP's they are involved in. That's a real testament to their determination. But also one of the few positive things I can say about the game. Now for the actual review..\n-------\nDon't let my limited hours of play fool you..there's a reason why my playtime hours are few (part of the negatives) but I've also got decades worth of multiplayer/MMO/single player game background under the belt to make this review plausible despite those hours. Also, I played the Shadowurn PnP since its inception around the late 80's/early 90's. But I'd also like to make SOME concessions to the fact that I haven't had a chance to experience ALL aspects of the game yet and that some of my review will be slightly skewed because of it.\n\nGraphics (6): The game looks incredibly similar to the Shadowrun Returns look/feel that was released around the time this was in development. To the point of being mistaken for a HareBrained Schemes product. It's not by HBS. SC has the same isometric perspective but it has camera rotation (of which I approve). The graphics are simple, but detailed and varied enough to not be too repetitive. Skinnable features like bodies, outfit pieces, weapons, etc. help break up the cookie cutter monotony.. but not by too much. But SOME variety is better than none. especially for a multiplayer game. It's just nothing to rave about.\n\nSound (5): Ambient sounds are very decent. The music is decent (although it gets repetitive after awhile). My BIGGEST complaint is the voiceover work. I don't think it's the Boston accents (fake or otherwise), as I've known Bostonians and don't mind the accent at all. I think the problem is that the voiceover work is lifeless and not quite matching with the scenes/moods. The voiceover work feels VERY scripted or prompter-read. As I said. lifeless.\n\nPerformance (5): During the god-awful launch, I REALLY wanted to write a review. But Cliffhanger asked folks to bear with them and hold off on writing reviews.. so I did. The network performance back then was horrendous. So much lag and dropoffs.. it was ridiculous and unplayable. They've since fixed that (good work indie developers). The graphics and network performance are now up to par and I don't really have anything negative or positive to say. It works. It's not an AAA title so it's not like there should really be any performance issues. So why the lowish score? Because I cannot login to the game due to my unicode Steam profile name. I've played ALOT of Steam games and my unicode name is not an issue. It is when attempting to login to SC. Why does SC use my profile name (which can be subject to change) rather than my Steam ID # (which does NOT change)?! It doesn't make sense and I like to leave my profile name the way it is rather than to change it for ONE game. First world problems, eh?\n\nGameplay (7): The gameplay is decent. It does a good job of embodying multiplayer aspects that one would've liked to have seen in something like Shadowrun Returns. The turn-based tactical gameplay feature is pretty much the same as it is in Shadowrun Returns. Good variety of outfits, weapons, skills and enough things to do. What kept this area from getting a higher rating is the boring hub, the overall repetitiveness and lack of open world. It's the launching pad for your missions/story, places to get supplies, talk to a few NPC's now and again and that's it. Cliffhanger lost the chance to make this a little roleplay area for people to hang out in and be a shadowrunner. This is where you can feel where it went from Shadowrun Online to just Shadowrun Chronicles.\n\nStory/Content (7): This is another area that could've received a higher rating. It's just storyline/missions. Some are repeatable, some are not. This was a complaint with Shadowrun Returns. If you have a hub, give us random shadowrunner jobs for money, karma, etc. (much like the Sega Genesis version of Shadowrun.. nostalgia). Regardless, Cliffhanger did a decent job of bringing Shadowrun to the multiplayers with an ok storyline. New content is also upcoming too, which is a good sign for the game's longevity.\n\nVerdict (6):It's an ok game. Nothing spectacular. Nothing incredibly bad. It's just right in the middle, slightly above mediocre. It had/has potential. It still has room to grow. Maybe I will change my review in time. Despite my middle-ground score, though, I will not recommend this game. This is a niche game for Shadowrun players. It would be boring to pretty much anyone else. Plus, you can't help but feel SC is a Shadowrun Returns knockoff clone, just with multiplayer and without the UGC (User Generated Content)","October 21, 2015","false","5.8"," 46 of 60 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","46","60","0","2"

Count me in!"... now I know better.\n\nShadowrun Online is a frustrating experience that leaves you wondering what the hell where the developers thinking? The graphics are low quality, there's little customization, no online world, no hub, no nothing. You are forced (condemned you might say) to play the badly put together "campaign" (a series of somewhat interconected missions that don't make a lot of sense... if any). The difficulty is extremely hard and even in online coop you'll find levels to be impossible without lots and lots of LUCK, not skill, LUCK.\n\nYou can also play some random missions, but as I said, difficulty is terrible all around. And you know what? It's not the fact that the game is hard, because - honestly - that's not enough reason to call a game bad... it's the fact that it doesn't feel like Shadowrun and that its NOT fun.\n\nDo not buy this game... do yourself a favor and buy Shadowrun Returns... doesn't have MP, but at least you'll be getting a much better experience for your money.\n\nEDIT - Christmas 2014\n\nI was bored on christmas day and decided to give the new patch a try...\n\nThe game has gotten better, to the point that it can actually be enjoyable to play. It's still ultra-rough around the edges, character customization is very limited (but now at least you can choose what weapons you'd like to specialize in and there's some very MINOR progression) and the missions are very simple and feel "stiff" at times, meaning that they are very very linear.\n\nThe game is still hard, but now with the co-op mode and the henchmen system it's possible to finish missions. Sometimes you'll still need some luck to get past them, but it is possible.\n\nI'm completely confused by developer's intentions though. They allow co-op but only between 2 players, when there's 4 party members in a run. Each player gets to bring a "henchman", which functions pretty much like another player which you control. Why not allow people to make 4 man groups? I don't get it all.\n\nI still wouldn't recommend this game, as it is far from being a satisfying product and you'll get - at most - a couple hours out of it before you get bored.\n\nWho knows, maybe in another six-months it could become a product worth 5 to 10 dollars.\n\nEDIT - 03/14/15\n\nSo now they change the name of the game to Shadowrun Chronicles "Boston Lockdown". Apparently people were getting confused with the last name...\n\nYeah, you see... People saw Shadowrun Online and though it was an MMO type of game. Obviously this is not the aim of the devs, they just want you to be able to play with other people if you want. Like, getting help for quests or in PVP arenas...\n\nI can see how people would get confused. After all, there's a lot of companies that make the same mistake. You know... like Lord of the Rings ONLINE... or Warhammer ONLINE... or DC Universe ONLINE... or Dungeons and Dragons ONLINE... or EVE Online... or Hello Kitty ONLINE or... well you get the idea.\n\nCome on devs, what the hell is going on here? Did you spend all the funding and can't finish the game now? Do you intend to just slap a new name on this product, rush it down the pipe line and cash in while you can?\n\nDO NOT BUY until things clear out here.","October 13, 2014","false","8.1"," 86 of 127 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","86","127","2","1"

Through that I have found Cliffhanger to be a small independent studio, and true to their name at the start, asked for a very modest ammount for such an ambitious project. However, they got the funding to do it, and through a number of pitfalls (like losing their artist... like literally, disappeared!) and some setbacks in the initial development (realizing they needed a stronger game engine to do everything they wanted- and had to design a new one to accomodate!) they finally launched the Early Access Alpha. I have also consistently participated in this process since it launched.\n\nThe Alpha launched smooth, and for the most part each update has been tight and bug-free. When bugs have come up, they quickly take care of them. They care very much about the project, and are as passionate as the fans they're making the game for, and it shows in every update.\n\nNow that they're about a month away from officially launching, I feel comfortable giving as complete a review as I can. I have to say I still look very forward to each and every update as it has gotten better and better! They have ALWAYS listened and responded to feedback, and extra development time was taken to make the game 'right' based on that feedback.\n_________________________________\n\nShadowrun is a game set in our world's future. Magic has once again awakened, including dragons and creatures of myth, which both blend and  clash regularly with Megacorporations and high-tech advancements like cyberware and AI's. Magic returning to the world was not a smooth process, and led to reshaping the landscape of politics, society, and even warfare. That's where you come in. As a shadowrunner, you exist in the shadows of those giants (politics, society, and warfare) to work for often unknown employers with even more ineffable agendas... Whatever pays the bills, right Chummer?\n\nCharacter Creation is easy to grasp, You choose a gender and a race (Ork, Dwarf, Troll, Elf, or Human) each of which have their own advantages and disadvantages. You may select from a variety of backgrounds to help round out your character with other qualities as well, and help set a tone for how you want them to develop.\n\nThe list is ever-expanding with them adding to it all the time. Backgrounds examples are: Bouncer, Ex-Cop, Gutter Rat, Ganger, Spirit Talker (magic, remember), Engineer, Tribal Youth, Lucky, and even "Boring" if you don't want any of the other options (it has neither bonuses or penalties). And you'll have a place to put in your own text to expand on that and tell your character's unique story.\n\nThe most fun part of character creation is (of course) designing the character! You get to choose from a wide selection of fashions, gear, and hairstyles to build your character with. One of the best parts is THERE IS NO GENDER SEPERATION IN FASHION, giving you the widest selection to choose from! You want to make a male Ork in a mini-skirt? Go for it chummer, we don't judge! You don't want to be all girly-girl as a female Elf character? Put on a road-warrior stop sign top with some camo pants to go with your cigar and automatic rifle!\n\nThe next update before the official launch will also include a variety of skin tones to choose from as well!\n\nYou have a number of Skills to choose and build up, but you can only use two Skill-sets at a time during any given run (Pistols, Automatics, Shotguns, Conjuring, Spellcraft, Hacking, Rigging (drone combat), Blades, and Blunt Weapons). Find the combination  that works best for you and build them up with the XP you earn, increasing the 'Skill Tree' system which opens up more options and manevuers for your character to use during combat. You can buy into as many Skill sets as you want, but be careful not to spread yourself too thin by doing so! Better to aim for a couple specialties, especially early on. There's a lot of really good, tough choices to be made there!\n\nYour "Attributes" are represented by a Body Tree, and a Mind Tree that you can build up as well. Are you fast and limber, adept at dodging things, or big, tough, and built like a brick? Maybe a little bit of both? Are you knowledgeable about lockpicking, and data manipulation, or observant and quick-witted? Again, little bit of both?  This should be completely nailed down in the next update, so I don't know the particulars, but we have tested a number of the systems that will be going into it. These Trees will help 'fine tune' your character with little bonuses to health or dodge, make you more adept at skills and feats you can perform (lockpicking, hacking, breaking objects, etc).\n\nGameplay is solid as a turn-based tactial game. The tutorial eases you into it, but it can get deadly quick as you progress further into the plot. Gangers, corporate security forces (as well-armed as any paramiliatary force), armored drones, cyber-security dogs, and spirit guardians all stand in the way of your goals, and armor only goes so far against a chainsaw-weilding ganger maniac, or a security captain with a flame thrower!\n\nOne thing. It's not 'open world' like a lot of MMO's. There are social hubs you gather in, and a map of the city that you travel through with various zoned instances, that open up more and more areas for you to explore as you progress in the game. It's easy to forget that though once you're in and playing.\n\nThe main story has mostly been hidden from us until launch, so I can't give an honest review to that. The only things we know for sure is a dragon went on a rampage, everyone's getting infected with some sort of insanity, the city's gone on lockdown, and if we want to survive we need to get a supply route going for one of our contacts, and there's a lone officer stuck in the middle of this without backup that needs our help (and can pay well enough).\n\nAnother BIG thing we've known since the Kickstarter, our combined actions will affect the world in a MAJOR way. Cliffhanger has teamed with Catalyst (the current producers of the tabletop game) to co-create this story. The combined actions of our characters will bring down one of the biggest Megacorporations in the world!!\n\nWhich one? Well that's for us to decide!\n\nThere will be OPTIONAL PvP in the game as well! They have already outlined a few modes for us. One is a run team (their characters) vs another team playing the role of NPC security forces or gangers. The other is a "Running Man" style of team vs team in a Sport style environment with leaderboards and such, and another is 'objective based' which pits two teams against an environment and an objective that doesn't mean they have to fight each other... just keep the other from it.\n\n\nSo if you're a fan of Shadowrun, you'll want in on the action and see what both Cliffhanger and Catalyst have in store for us!\n\nIf you don't know Shadowrun, but are a fan of tactical turn-based strategy games, this is definitely worth a look!\n\nIf you're a fan of interactive roleplaying with other players in a dystopian cyberpunk futureistic setting? Well it's still worth a look! I can already tell you from the forums there's the opportunity for a thriving roleplaying community in this game, and the Dev's are already working on possible things to encourage it (private 'hang out' areas for groups to talk away from the main social hubs, etc.)\n\nHope you enjoyed the review, and with any luck I'll see you in the shadows!\n\nCrunch~","March 28, 2015","true","353.6"," 64 of 91 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","64","91","2","0"

Shadowrun Returns and the expansion Dragonfall [Calling it DLC would be an insult] have met with mostly favorable reviews; I know I've enjoyed both quite a bit despite, of course, a few limitations. The pen and paper tabletop game, Shadowrun 5th Edition, has hit the ground running since its release last summer. Catalyst Games has said the core rulebook has broken all of its sales records. A deck building game, a la Android: Netrunner, a tabletop miniatures game, a la WH40K, and, a Euro-style tile-based board game are all in the works.\n\n\nSo now we have Shadowrun: Online thrown into the mix.\n\nRight now it's PVP and 4 short missions. There is no tutorial - which is fantastic, btw, because tutorials are creepy and always trying to hold my hand. This means the art of war in Shadowrun Online must be extracted through trial and error. I actually felt relieved that I was expected to use my brain. The first time through I didn't pay much attention to what I was doing and got clobbered...fast...by the AI. The second time through I paid a little bit more attention, and realized some of the basic principles. After that, it became quite enjoyable. The world itself is pretty much non-existent at this point. But the game play is definitely there and it's good. The two characters you use throughout the missions synergize really well.\n\nOne thing I would like to see would be a limitation to spells and ammo. One of the spells is kinda broken, not too much, but a bit. If they added spell drain, like in the tabletop, spellslinging would become a much more serious matter - right now it feels a bit OP. I also think ammo should be limited. There should be the danger of running out of ammo, in fact. I think that could add a lot to the tension of each match.\n\nI'll say this: they are very blunt about the current state of the game on their page. I found the warning to be commensurate with the build.\n\nGetting it now means you'll get to know the game play, but not so much the world of Shadowrun. I recommend reading some background material here: http://www.shadowruntabletop.com/game-resources/shadowrun-timeline/\n\nAlso, head over to amazon and order a used shadowrun novel [ .05 + 3.99 shipping lol]\n\nEdit: I want to mention that this game works really well with touch controls. Playing it on a touch screen laptop or tablet is lots of fun. Turn-based games and touch controls just make sense, and I'd like to see other devs follow Cliffhanger's lead on this.","March 31, 2014","true","8.6"," 107 of 164 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","107","164","0","4"

Unfortunately overall it's a screwed up design all around.\n\nThe Big Problems (Many others have given much more in depth reviews on this)\n1. Really watered down skill system, no attributes, detailed stats, no meaningful multiclassing.\n2. They tried to design this MMOish thing that didn't quite take. Short version? Henchmen are weak, but there's no LFG function in the game. Just have to go through chat ala Warcraft 2003 Ironforge/Org. That's assuming the game doesn't break your mission and everyone has to restart.\n3. Armor system is seriously screwed. Every attack eats away your armor. Ok, so, build an evasion defense, right? One hit will blow through both your armor and your hps at higher levels. GG. Also, no overwatch, so yeah... Flanked=dead.\n4. There is no Adept tree, a classic of Shadowrun. Why does that matter? Crap armor design + no other mitigation options = a dead street samurai. Also, you only get two consumable slots. Need a heal? Too bad. Also, no mage healing...really? No regen... really?

We'll, we're in Q1, meaning the devs have less than 3 months to move this game into a release ready state.\n\nWhat is missing?

And then, they choose to set it in Boston - the city of my birth - as the setting, and I very nearly "squeee'd" in delight.\n\nSadly, none of those hopes panned out.  The game just doesn't really feel like Shadowrun.\n\nCharacter Creation leaves me completely uninspired, from the UI, straight through to the mechanics underneath some of the choices.  Building a character in PnP was always about balancing your choices, deciding what to prioritize and what to marginalise.  Do you want to be a skilled elf mage?  You're likely to be woefully strapped for cash, then.  Top-shelf Rigger or Hacker?  No magic for you, and either you're stuck beign human or your attributes (strength, agility, those kinds of things) are going to be a bit wimpy.\n\nNone of that is in the game.  Indeed, you don't CHOOSE anything except a background (with attendant small modifiers), and race (with even smaller modifiers).  You don't decide if you're going to be a mage or not - EVERYONE has basic magic skills.  You don't decide if you're going to be a hacker or not - EVERYONE has basic hacking skills.

And whats up with the strange race-boni? There are no social-skills of any kind since you don't need them.) it's just not a roleplaying game.\n(Skillsystem had a slight change since I wrote this, not enough to rewrite everything but I want to be fair so I add this, it's a little less absurd than it was before, as non-combat-skills have been moved to 2 new trees but still no social-skills or attributes)\n\n\nSo what is it? Think of it as XCom, but only the battles and even those are not as good as XComs or Xenonauts.\nYes there is kind of a hub in between the missions, but so far there is nothing important there. You can buy stuff, just like  in the village in Diablo, just less roleplay than in the village in Diablo (yeah hard to believe I know).","March 6, 2015","false","48.7"," 58 of 84 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","58","84","2","0"

I believe they have a long way to go, but with that said let's get into exactly how i feel the game is now. To start out the game has its main gameplay elements and they work great. It contains a decent amount of customization and skill trees, but it still has a long way to come until i can say 100% buy this game. Along with the limited customization the story is very short and the missions can get very repetitive. This being said, everything i have said as negatives the devs have said they will fix or expanded upon. I really can’t wait to see what the devs can do for the full release.\n\nPros\nCore Elements are all here\nFun combat\nRegular Updates\nShow tons of potential for the full release/future updates\nMultiple races\nMultiplayer\n\n\nCons\nNeeds more customization\nNeeds more missions\nCan become repetitive\nIt's just not finished\n\nConclusion\nDon't buy Shadow Run Chronicles: Boston Lockout unless you can be patient. It's not finished, but the updates that have come out up until now really show promise. The core gameplay is finished and is tons of fun.

So buy it for sure, if you like those kind of games!\n\nOK now for you tabletop RPG fans:\n2 things about SR Chronicles I REALLY like:\n1)  Hackers/Deckers are a completely viable, distinct form of combat all their own. They interfere with opponents’ cyberware & gear which can stun, damage, and debuff opponents. They can also buff allies, giving them bonuses to hit, for example. This is far superior to the tabletop SR game IMO. The great part is they do NOT need any LOS(line of sight), effectively “shooting” thru walls etc. (since they are using the matrix and/or wireless to access opponents), so go ahead & hide your decker behind walls, large cover, etc.\nOf course they can also use guns, magic, and/or rigging if built that way, but no NEED to!\n2)  No Increased # of actions in combat! Just 1 movement + 1 action per player per round. I have been saying for YEARS multiple action passes in combat need to go (in tabletop SR). They slow combat to a crawl. This game all but eliminates them (some few exceptions) which makes combat FAST, and much more FUN. Speed can still give you other bonuses, and yes, in a few cases an extra action, but it’s rare and doesn’t slow combat too much.\n\nAs you can infer, it’s skill based, no classes. So you can be a Mage/Hacker/Blademaster if you really want to. You can also just specialize in one or two things if you prefer.\n\nSome very viable builds: Melee (melee does more damage than ranged in this game), Automatics (obvious), Hacking(see above), Spellcasting (tho nerfed compared to tabletop, to balance it). Rigging is said to be one of the best in single player campaign mode, but not good (ie. very challenging) when you get to the endgame/multiplayer. People seem to dislike summoning(they say it does less damage than everything else).\n\nAll in all, it is a fun game. If you like turn-based RPGs, tabletop RPGs, or the pencil&paper version of SR, you should definitely check this out! The Boston setting is something different, too. And…Dragons!\n---\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/groups/graywalkers : upcoming supernatural, post-apocalyptic, turn-based tactical RPG!","June 28, 2015","true","136.3"," 39 of 55 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","39","55","0","0"

And that's after Evolve (That I rather enjoyed), Watchdogs, etc.\n\nThere's no classes, no Overwatch, no difficulty settings, no 'AP' or ability points, ie, a set amount of points used to move, fire a certain amount of times. Instead you have 'Move'. And 'Shoot'(/melee attack). If you do the latter before the former, that characters turn is just over.\n\nAll in all, the amount of things sacrificed in order to make the game easier and more.. 'user friendly'?? for people to pick up and play co-op, drastically outweighs the constant, unhideable chatbox that counts for player interaction.\n\nIf you want a game for your kid to get into 'tactical' turn based RPGs, this is perfect. It feels, (and sounds. Ughh the voice acting and sound quality!) like a facebook game. All it's missing is an energy bar telling you to buy in game currency to continue.\n\nTo clarify, there are no microtransactions in the game, but honestly, even if it were a f2p game, I'd of been disappointed with it still.\n\nSo sad to see such a good name like Shadowrun, watered down so drastically. Either go full MMORPG, or stick to the singleplayer. Here's hoping SR:Hong Kong will go back to what we loved.\n\n\nEDIT: When the kickstarter says 'We've changed the name from 'Shadowrun: Online' because people were disappointed with their expectations of the product', I instantly thought, 'Oh cool, a standard singleplayer game'.

Each of the skill trees are linear and looking at them there is a lack of variety of skills.

Same goes for every other tree, skill points buys you drones which you all have to get in order to proceed down that path. Results? Mages will all look alike even if you cross train to be different you'll just look like every other Mage/shooter or whatever. Occassionally you will get a branching choice which will lock you out of getting it's opposite later on but for the most part these do little in diversifying characters.\n\nI can't recommend this game at this moment but hopefully they will expand on this later on and it will be worth it's price.","May 15, 2015","false","18.3"," 38 of 56 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","38","56","0","0"

When I first loaded it up and I realised it was an MMO I was very surprised to say the least. Thinking it just to be a standard RPG that allowed you to play some missions co-op.\n\nI have played the game for about 8 hours over last two days (that should tell you something straight away) and I am really enjoying it. There is currently an active player base and you can do 'runs' with characters at all levels, this might mean you are a bit OP in early missions so I wouldn't recommend this if you like a challenge. However, if you can't get real people at a similar level you can always take the AI henchmen.\n\nThe game has you starting in a standard MMO town area with shops and npcs to talk to, and all the other human players milling around. It doesn't take long to get your first quests and make a team of willing volunteers or AI slaves. Each mission is a turn based combat affair. However, all your moves happen at the same time. So no waiting for one player to decide what to do. The weapons and abilities are as varied as in other Shadowrun games with e all the races to choose from. As you level up you get to make your character more unique with ability choices, although be careful here as there is currently no way to re-skill. You can also hack turrets and use abilities to loot secret areas, which is a nice touch.\n\nI think this game is an innovative addition to the turn based combat genre and I hope other developers will learn from this model, and we will have a lot more co-op simultaneous turn based combat in the future. This would be a great addition to an X-Com or Jagged Alliance games. Hint, hint.","May 10, 2015","true","16.0"," 33 of 48 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","33","48","0","0"

If one must purchase, play with friends and definitely wait for a sale.+\n\nSCOPE: All story-specific content that has been released to date, which includes the main story campaign and the Infected DLC. All remaining content is effectively grinding gear and Karma (exp), and will have its own section.\n\nThis review is also completely SPOILER FREE.\n\nOh, and for clarity: SRC-BL is NOT an 'MMO' in any real way, save for the mandatory servers. There is no resource trading to speak of (even between a player's own runners), and open "grinding" isn't an option until after the end of the main story.\n\nFor all practical purposes, treat SRC: BL as a turn-based PVE game with the option of inviting human players along...and it's all hosted online.\n\n\n-GAMEPLAY: The short, dirty version is that the gameplay is way too simple and "streamlined" for Shadowrun. If I had to use a relative comparison, I'd say it's like XCOM: Enemy Unknown, possibly even a bit simpler.\n\nThere's ZERO "legwork", no real resource trading or management, no Matrix runs or even Shadowland banter (to be fair, there's a good story reason for that), and character building is bare-bones even compared to its sister game series, Shadowrun Returns.\n\nNormally I wouldn't hold something like this against a game, except it's supposed to be SHADOWRUN; and in an era where online games as complex as EVE Online remain popular and viable, I don't think it was too much to ask for at least a little bit more depth.\n\n-ENGINE, GRAPHICS, AND AUDIO: This game is low-budget and it shows. The 3D graphics look ~12 years out of date vs the modern high-def bloom-fest of current gen gaming. Personally, I have no issue with that, because the visual style fits well enough (well, the models could afford to look less "toony"), and it isn't an offensive departure.\n\nThe main campaign has some voice-acting, and it ranges from 'passable' to 'plain ol bad'. Nothing painfully offensive, but I routinely found myself re-reading text and doing better takes than most of the droning VAs, in-situ. Yikes.\n\nMusic...it's completely unremarkable. I have nothing to say about it, good or bad.\n\n\n-INTERFACE: Best thing I can say about the interface, is that it's "functional" (not great).\nThere's a number of improvements I can and will suggest, including:\n\n-Please add a spot "ping" button to highlight specific spots or zones to other players. It would immensely help coordination.\n-Remember which skill the player last had highlighted; regardless of whenever another action or event occurs.\n\n-An effective range checker, or "valid target" area indicator. Mostly to check whether you can fire on a target or not before you move.\n\n-Please add discrete movement, with queueing.\nThere are times where moving around specific hazards in a single turn isn't possible, despite having the total movement available, because the game automatically uses the shortest path for everything.\n\nUsing movement queuing (that is, letting the player map a specific path before confirming) instead of always forcing "shortest distance jog" would allow for more in-depth hazard design.\n\n\n-STORY, DIFFICULTY AND OVERALL PACING: The story is pretty meh, with one, maybe two really interesting moments in the entire thing. The difficulty curve will depend heavily on how many player character runners you bring along, and at what relative "level" each one is to the mission.\n\nThe base campaign's story missions curve up fairly evenly, with only one or two anamolously hard missions along the way. Post-campaign missions are (initially) off the charts in terms of difficulty, spiking WAY beyond what you had previously dealt with (barring possibly the very last mission).\n\nOne big upside I will mention, is that at least SRC-BL has pretty damn accurate/honest Hit%; it doesn't hide the enemy's personal evasion bonuses or quietly skew successes like it does in Shadowrun Returns. Or at least, I didn't embark on any of my "Miss 3 shots at 95%+ in a row" streaks like I did so often in SRR.\n\n\n\n-INFECTED MISSIONS: This DLC is...pretty bad IMO. All signs point to a rush job.\n1) There's no voice-acting, even for all the characters that previously had VA. This wouldn't be so bad if not for the fact that this forces the player to read the text...which brings me to my second criticism of the Infected DLC...\n\n2)...The text is LITTERED with errors; mostly typos, but more than a couple of flat out broken sentences.\n\n3) Little original content. Apart from the maps (and the Ex-Pacis faction mobs), most everything else is a reskin of previous content.\n\n4) The difficulty spikes are wildly uneven.\nThe second mission was an unwinnable slug-fest the first time; second attempt it was a slow cakewalk. As in, the encounters were very different, despite having the same characters and resources available.\n\n4a) Oh, and making Achievements purely luck-based,  is a stupid enough concept. Making it so you only get ONE crack at a given story mission achievement with that character is just cruel.\n\nOVERALL: I would wait on a sale, or possibly just pass entirely. I don't want to leave the impression that I hate this game, not by a long shot.\nIt's just...as a long time Shadowrun fan, it's far too simple and bland. As a generic turn-based RPG, it will kill some time, but is otherwise not terribly memorable.\n\nI really want the Shadowrun video games to do well, or at least well enough to warrant more ambitious Shadowrun projects; hence the length of this review. If you're a fan looking for more SR lore and story, I'd stick to the tabletop, novels and the last two SRR games (Dragonfall is an excellent story, and Hong Kong has been pretty great so far).\n\nBoston Lockdown has a strong potential setting, and pulls a couple of big name-drops in the story's crisis, but ultimately leaves no lasting impression.\n\n(it also makes many mistakes with the in-universe physical laws; namely involving hacking and magic, but these changes were clearly done with the interest of gameplay mechanics in mind, so I let them slide purely on those grounds. It still makes me roll my eyes watching drones say IMMUNE TO MAGIC when a POWER bolt hits them)","May 11","false","138.0"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

I rarely have fun in MMOs, due to grinding or just lack of sustainability, but something kept me coming back to this game. True, Ive played mostly solo, but the missions on offer are a lot of fun due to the XCOM like aproach to turn based tactics. If anything, its more traditional since theres no such thing as overwatch, but definitely many ways to customise your tactical experience. (also, the missions are littered with possibilities to gain extras, not like Mass Effect where it was essentially "Press E to Gather Extra ♥♥♥♥" but you need to have team members with those qualities (Lockpicking, destruction, organharvesting, hacking).\n\nNow, the provided weaker NPCs teammembers are enough for the simpler missions, but it gradually becomes more challenging, to the point where you need to start relying on other players.\n\nAs to the progression system for players, there are a bunch of skill trees where you can modify your player from, they range from the standard weapon types (pistol, SMG, shotgun, melee) to the fantasy & cyberpunky (Enchanting, hacking & rigging (drone warfare)) and they branch a bit, and you can generally upgrade after almost every mission for the first ten or more, keeping it fresh and giving you a good motivation for continuing on.\n\nThe story is better than average, the mission design is varied.\n\nBut I think enough has been said about how the game works and so on; I had fun. It definitely had that "Just One More Turn!!!111" quality for me. Admittedly, Ive only played less than 10 hours, but I think those hours I did have time to, it was worth it. And with a bit more polish and hopefully enough content to last a lifetime, its a nobrainer if you like TB combat in a technofantasy setting.\n\nNow excuse me while I play some more.\n\nEdit 24.04.2015: Grammar & forgot a line.","April 24, 2015","true","12.2"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","18","22","0","0"

The game that was kick-started as Shadowrun Online is here now as: Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown.\n\nThe story takes place in a city that has not ever been included in the deep history of Shadowrun. This gives the players and official Shadowrun storytellers to create a new experience in a rich world of cybertechnology and magic.\n\nAs a player, you can create your own meta-human and customize it in your own unique way as you journey through the current story. A player can make their own arch-type as they see fit. You are not limited to the standard tabletop pen and paper rules. This means your own imagination and planning gives you an experience you control. Yes, using cyberware does limit a player's ability to use magic. That still is there like those familiar with the standard game would expect. But, you can have your own mix of skills being a combined summoner and rigger using spirit beasts and deadly drones as you prefer. Or, you can mix ranged hacking skills with channeled mana attacks. It is an open skill system to explore just as much as the adventure of the story.\n\nWhy has it taken so long to get here? For those unaware, there was a complete turn-over in the development team. A player can see this for themselves when they look at the long list of those credited with working on this game. Cliffhanger Productions took over development and has brought the game to those who dreamt and paid for this game as kickstarters or as early release players. Cliffhanger and their talented crew have excellent experience in working with the game engine and have a solid history of releasing updates and new content with their previous projects. As developers they are uncommon in their excellence by frequently listening too and communicating with the game community on desired features and improvements. This means, that they were able to provide a relatively polished game at release with the full promise and expectations for new story, material and addition to be expected to enrich the game experience and storyline.\n\nWhat does this mean as of today, release date? You can expect that there might be a few hiccups like with any game at release. You can trust in Cliffhanger's development crew to squash bugs, balance gameplay, add features and with the assistance of official Shadowrun story creators, you can cut a razor sharp line as you navigate a new and developing adventure in the Shadowrun Universe.\n\nWhat else is there to say? Jack-in, lock and load and summon the magic spirits and join others in the alleys of Boston to become a legendary shadowrunner!\n\nPOST NOTE - SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: I am having no problems running this with my this with my dual-core 2gb ram winXP desktop. Wereas, my newer single-core 4gb ram win7 laptop, it is a bit sluggish. So, even though system requirements do not say anything about winXP - chances are you can run it on that OS if you have good systems gear.","April 28, 2015","true","039.7"," 36 of 55 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","36","55","0","4"

First, I'm going to be comparing this game to Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall a lot, because it's the only other really equitable game to compare it to. Second, I'm ignoring the server lag for the purposes of this review. It's a known issue, and the developers have been very straightforward about trying to find a fix for it. They're a small studio, so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt in that regard.\n\nFirst up, we have the good:\n\n1) Pretty graphics, relatively speaking. Chronicles obviously isn't going to set any records for having pretty artwork, but what's there is eye-catching and does a good job of setting the cyberpunk mood that Shadowrun so requires. The character portraits are hand drawn, coupled with decently detailed three-dimensional character models. From a character model standpoint, I'd say that it's prettier than Shadowrun Returns - though not by much.\n\n2) Adequate soundtrack. It's not something that will blow you away, but I found myself occasionally tapping my foot or my finger in time to some beat or another while I was killing badguys.\n\n3) Solid combat. It's not the most detailed system out there, but the combat system is adequately detailed (especially for a game that is in part being aimed at portable devices). Much like the more modern incarnation of XCOM, Chronicles uses a streamlined tactical combat engine with a square combat grid, directional cover, and percentage-based attacks. There are a variety of special attacks, and things like range, cover, and positioning will have a direct impact on what strategies you want to use during combat. Enemy AI is acceptable, with enemies generally making use of cover and doing an adequate job of trying to catch you off-guard (focusing fire on exposed targets, attempting to flank, using their own special abilities).\n\n4) Interesting, if linear story. The game is very linear, which can be a good or bad thing depending on what you're looking for, but what's there is fairly intriguing. It's not fantastic, but it at least has a good general grasp of the setting, and does a decent job of setting up a few big twists as it progresses. An important thing to keep in mind is that where Shadowrun Returns was set in the 2050s (surrounding the "Universal Brotherhood" incident), Chronicles is actually set in the 2070s. Technology has advanced to the point where things like bioware, nanotech, and wireless technology are commonplace. This is a small but important detail, especially for those who have previously played Shadowrun Returns or Dragonfall, but aren't otherwise familiar with the setting.\n\n5) Character customization. There are a decent number of options when building your character, including character portrait, gender, species, background trait, wardrobe, and a small number of starting skills. While there could always stand to be more options, there are a fair amount currently available. Physical options such as gender, species, wardrobe, and cyberware are all reflected visually on your character model.\n\n6) The community is great. Thus far, the community seems friendly and genuinely helpful. You get the occasional bad apple in the bunch, but most players will be quick to offer help when you need it, whether it's the answer to a question or another runner to help you through a tough mission. The system is set up so that "griefing" is difficult, with limited friendly fire and a "shared loot" system that prevents people from swiping your hard-won nuyen or karma out from under your nose. The devs even pop up on the Global Chat from time to time, to answer some questions or address concerns "in person".\n\nAnd then we have the bad:\n\n1) Streamlined = Simplified. Shadowrun Returns used a stripped down, simplified version of the Shadowrun rules system, but Chronicles goes one step further by simplifying it even more. There are currently only nine skill trees in Chronicles (seven weapon skills and two utility skills), and you can only use four of them on a character at a time (two weapon skills and two utility skills). Equipment progression is fairly linear, with most new gear being a straightforward upgrade without any need for real thought about how to equip yourself. You're occasionally presented with an option that actually matters to an extent (such as whether to use Cyberware, mutually exclusive skill options, or what two "tactical slot" items to take with you on a mission), but these kinds of decisions are few.\n\n2) Poor documentation. The game is still in a state of flux, because it's freshly released, and it went through a lot of revisions during the late testing stages. Some of the ability descriptions are poorly explained in the tooltips, and in rare cases they're actually incorrect (such as in the case of the Bioware Reflex Recorder or the Manabolt spell). Certain basic bits of information are withheld from you, though not deliberately - they simply haven't added in certain amenities yet. A detailed character sheet, for example, is very much needed. The devs have stated that they intend to address these issues, but they are currently low priority due to bigger issues (such as the server lag).\n\n3) Limited functionality. Much like with the poor documentation, there are a number of things that are planned but simply haven't been added yet. There's a Chat system, but it's currently very limited in what it can do. Certain basic functions such as "Ignore" or "Whisper" are not currently implemented, though they are planned. There's no buyback feature at merchants, so if you accidentally sell something, it's impossible to buy it back. There's no character respec system, which (coupled with the poor documentation on some abilities) can lead to great frustration when you pick a skill that you THOUGHT would be good but turns out to be useless. During missions, the sometimes clunky interface can often lead to mis-clicking or accidentally skipping your turn.\n\n4) Mildly lazy character/level designs. This is a debatable point, especially for a low-budget title like Chronicles, but it's worth mentioning since some people find it more annoying than others. While there are a lot of visual pieces of cyberware and clothing, many of them have clipping issues or odd limitations. Wearing a hat, for example, causes your hair to vanish. Wearing a longcoat causes your pants to vanish (though you can still equip some basic pairs of pants in your "underwear" slot). The pointed ears on most metahuman races WILL clip through pretty much any hat or helmet you wear, since they're all obviously designed for human heads. Maps are visually appealing and present tactical options, but many of the maps are re-used multiple times. They'll often try to obscure this by adding some new set dressing, or having you enter the map from a different direction, but you'll quickly start recognizing certain maps (such as the "Warehouse" map) because some are used for three or four separate missions.\n\n5) Limited content, lacks enough variety. What's in the game is fairly smooth and interesting, but there's just not enough of it - especially for a multiplayer game. The largest degree of variety you're going to run into is the runners created by other players, but the actual game itself is very limited. When it comes right down to it, there are only about twenty enemy designs in the game - which sounds like a lot, until you run into your fifteenth pack of barghests. Similarly, there aren't enough meaningful options for gear, or skill options, or character portrait options. The main story is "only" about twenty short missions (thirty if you count sidequests), which you can blow through in about a day of solid gaming.\n\nFinal Thoughts: All told, Chronicles is a promising start to something that could be a great game eventually. For now, it's best for someone looking for a casual strategy game, or any enthusiast of the Shadowrun 5e setting.\n","May 6, 2015","true","90.4"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","23","32","0","0"

Originally a pen and paper RPG, it's set in a dystopic cyberpunk future where the coming of whatever age heralded the return of magic to the world. What results is combat involving rifles and electronics hacking alongside orcs with high tech axes and mages slinging fireballs. Large corporations hold most of the power and tend to have their own private armies ('Wage Mages'), making things difficult for the Knight Errant, the equivalent of the Police force.\n\nGameplay wise it's a top down turn-based tactical RPG. Think XCom with more focus on the RPG elements. Unlike XCom though, Boston Lockdown is crippled by a lack of depth. The missions are generic: either kill everyone or kill everyone before they can get to a map point, the characters are shallow, the RPG development is wholly linear, the enemies are repetitive and predictable, and the maps are limited: within the first dozen missions we had played the same map three times, once starting from the other end. In terms of tactics, you have two options: move or shoot. There is no 'hunker down' or 'overwatch' option like seen in XCom, all cover is full cover and makes no noticeable difference to your defence.\n\nThe turn based system is totally broken. The game gives your turn as a group, allowing the player with the fastest hands to move first. You can be mid way through selecting an action when the camera snaps to the player moving, forcing you to follow along before snapping back to your character and resetting your actions to the default selection, making you start planning again. This is even worse when moving multiple characters you control, as even if you move the camera while one character is moving, it will snap back to your character when they have finished moving, often ending up in misclicks in the gaming equivalent of having a website shuffle around on your phone just as you're clicking a link. Worse than that is when all of these happen at once - which happens with alarming frequency - causing a character that you didn't select performing an action you didn't choose in a place you didn't want.\n\nCurrently on Steam for 30 ameribucks.

When it came out, it was just some very basic controls, and a few missions. Cliffhanger has really done a great, and I mean GREAT job fleshing it out, and giving it life. While not a MMORPG, the game does allow for you to group with friends and play through every scenario together. I play full fledged mmos, and most times I am in a four man party on those games, the same as in this game. So while you cant explore an open world, this world is just as exciting. Its gritty, it has fantastic genre music to immerse you into the Shadowrun world. The combat is seamless and enjoyable. You have great character customization availiable (skills) and even visual customization isnt bad (though most would say they wish they had more options, which I am sure they will add later).\n\nI think the absolute BEST part of the game, is that the dev team is in constant contact with its playerbase. Not only that, they take player feedback very seriously, and to heart. So much so that they completely recoded and revamped the game from scratch. They also did the same with the skill trees, using player feedback to sculpt them into more attactive and to be more viable.\n\nSo if you love turn based combat, and cyberpunk mixed with magic, with a gritty storyline and ambiance; I encourage you to give this game a go. I predict this game being one of the hidden gems on the steam community.","April 27, 2015","true","107.3"," 25 of 36 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","25","36","3","0"

There is no persistant world. It is just a single player game that has the option for Coop. Right now only two can coop, but I hope that changes when it goes live. For a coop game, it is fun and I am finding the story interesting. It would be nice to have an area where we can see the other players, make it a true online game. I understand that cost is an issue, but letting players pay to test can be a bad thing.  Some will understand that it's early access, but most will not and judge your unfinished game a little too harshly. I see the potential in it and I love turn based combat. I would recommend this game to those that enjoy the world, if you are looking for something with a faster pace... then Call of Duty is waiting for you.","January 1, 2015","true","7.7"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","20","28","0","0"

It's smooth and intuitive. Voice work is terrible, but you'll see a few other people agree with that! Graphics are already somewhat more polished I think than SRR. In-game dialogue is pretty decent, in-between mission text needs some work, perhaps some translation problems (since I believe the team does not have English as their first language) but that's easy fixed. Objectively, a cute experience that shows potential. It's clear that the dev team understand what Shadowrun is (like the Harebrained Schemes team) and are attempting to implement their vision.

And think most complaints are dumb\n\nNow the Real Review\nThe Major Negitive :\nLag - The Servers are having issues the game did not get tested for Stress and what knock and as SUCH the game is suffering for a turn based game to have a 20-30 Second delay behind each of your actions is kinda Stupid and is a legit reason not to get this game.  I can see people saying they dont want this game becouse of this issue\n\nThe Mix : Alot of people are complaining about random BS.  Like paying 60+$ For this I have no clue where they are buying this considering its for 30$ (Basicly 29.99) on steam,  Wtf is up with the people screeming at the company for them being scammed?\n\nSome of the in-game issues people are ♥♥♥♥♥ing about dont Realy seem to excist at all By that I Mean,  Essence Loss from Cyberware is a bit weird,  But dont take your hate on that just becouse you hate it that there is no Respect in the game dosnt mean it should burn in a fire pit\nI mean you cant have 2 differnt Cyber Skulls ... just think about that you now have 2 heads/2skulls that dosnt work / wouldnt work quit thinking it dos!\nor 2 differnt pairs of legs? ER WHAT? I mean people are ♥♥♥♥♥ing becouse you cant have 2 differnt pairs of cyber legs?\n\nThe Co-op is a bit strange,  By that I Mean If your on Mission 6, And your buddie is on mission 8,  You both cant go back to Mission 4 inless you find someone on said mission.  The co-op is mostly the HOST World,  So if you join your buddie your going to go back in time or into the future which can cause spoilers or a few other things on that line.  The Loot system however works for whatever Mission / Story progress your on.  So if your on mission 6 and you joined your buddie on mission 12,  Your getting mission 6 Loot while your buddie gets Mission 12 Loot.  Makes sence if you ask me,  He gets paid for the finish mission you dont,  But you both get the Karma and Loot (Even tho the loot is differnt and randomly Determined)\n\nPositive : Its playing Shadowrun with your buddies with Voice acting (Something SR/Dragonfall and such dosnt have much of) among other things.  So alot of the positive things from SR/Dragon Fall are basicly in this game,  Sep you can now Co-op.\n\nEdit : The Lag Seems to be getting a fix, while not 100% Playiabble i would say its not a Face palming i wanna toss my computer out to the street bad anymore and seems to be improving over-all give it another few days,  I would say maybe a week? Maybe more? less? not sure.  But it dos seem to get better slightly over time.","May 2, 2015","true","122.6"," 26 of 40 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","26","40","0","0"

Now, you dont need to  go on Runs with generic NPCs when you can team-up with friends or people online which can be very interesting. Coop is fluid and fast even for turn-based game like this. Combining different classes and skills on the field (from melee to ranged weapons and magic) leads to pretty interesting tactics and options when approaching different missions which you can complete in variety of ways. Add real people in this mix and you can have a Run-To-Remember and a lot of Fun in the process :)\n\nVisually it looks pretty good and art style is interesting. It has the atmosphere of the original Shadowrun games (Returns and Dragonfall). Comparing to previous games, this one is fully 3D so that you can rotate the view in the game, which gives you a better view of the level and opponents. This can be really helpful when you plan your next move. Also, I liked the RPG elements and customizations that game offers to a player and its character in game.\n\nStory is interesting and keeps you invested to want to uncover more and go deeper with it. This is especially interesting when playing with friends where you can discuss story on the go, and have your own theories about events that occurs in the game.\n\nI would really recommend this game to old fans of Shadowrun and new players eager to try new and interesting gameplay and new aproach to online coop story-based games.","April 22, 2015","true","11.9"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","17","24","0","1"

No dialogue options. For a game like Shadowrun this is a fatal mistake right off the bat. After Harebrained Schemes came up with their Shadowrun Returns series (the series that got me into CRPGs to begin with I might add) you kind of expect them. It adds immersion and makes the game more enjoyable as it makes you feel like your guy is an actual person in the world rather than just an avatar for you to move around in it with.\n\n2. The combat is just... eh, kinda there. It doesn't feel as intuitive or engaging as it does in Shadowrun Returns.\n\n3. Why is this an MMO? No really, why? It really takes me out of the game when I'm trying to get into my epic cyberpunk adventure and in the lower left corner are the words 'LFG Daily PST' over and over. If I wanted that I'd turn my WoW account back on.\n\nOverall, you're probably better off spending your money on Shadowrun Returns, Dragonfall, and Hong Kong.

Classes, skills, leveling - its all there, and its done very well.  Especially when you have in mind that there are not that many cyberpank games out there.

(especially for me because I'm not that type of guy that plays a lot of turn based games). But anyways I guess most of the people enjoy the difficulty level of the current version;)\n\nI also like the art style and the new voice set. From my point of view they boost the atmosphere so much that the game remembers me a bit of Army of Two. And they add more personality to your characters which is really important for me!\n\nBut I also have to criticise some of the controls. Don't get me wrong they work fine for me but they could have been made better... especially the shop or even the gear menu (feels like the gear selection of a 1st person shooter). Or even the character customization: I want detailed previous of the item when I hover over its name.... not select it, then press equip and only then I see what kind of item I get! That is not very innovative! It feels like the developers were a bit in a hurry or did not have that much time to polish those menus!\n\nMaybe we see some further great changes in an upcoming DLC? I hope so because there's so much potential in that current build and it would be a pity to release it without any future support or new patches/DLCs. So pls keep up the good work!\n\nAt least I can recommend that game to anybody that likes Xcom or similar games of that genre, but seriously I can't say if it is the perfect Shadowrun experience for the true PnP Shadowrun fans.\n\nWhat matters most is that it's fun to play and you guys should definitely give it a try!\n\nTHX","April 23, 2015","true","13.5"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

The variety of possible actions on runs seems to be quite limited: walk, run, interact, shoot/cast spell/summon/hack... no overwatch, no steadying weapons, no hiding, no hunkering down. Possibly some of this will be available later in the campaign or via perks.\nSpeaking of perks, there are loads of them and they are what differentiates characters. Here SR really is only a theme on top of a different game. Reflexboosters increase your accuracy and crit chance, heightened initiative lowers your chance to get hit and there is no turn order based on initiative.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stoney/recommended/267750/","Stoney","Stoney","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stoney/","213 products in account","Firstly, before this review a disclaimer; I like the Shadowrun setting. I was introduced to it through Shadowrun returns and Dragonfall and like it very much. Also, this game is made by a different developer and is not to do with the "SR returns" games so don't go in expecting that.\n\n\nSynopsis:\nThis is a tactical "XCOM" or FF Tactics style online turn-based grid RPG\nThe plot revolves around a quarantine being enforced in Boston after a virus breaks out. The idea is the entire area is cut off from the rest of the country. You play a shadowrunner trying to make a few Nuyen and get to see the events which lead up to that.\n\n\nGood points:\nCombat:\nThe combat is extremely fun and addictive. I personally played my first character all the way to the end of the game solo using the ingame henchmen. The game is unrelenting if you are not prepared but very rewarding when you beat it.\n\n\nCo-op:\nThis game really shines in the co-operative department; despite as mentioned I finished this game initially solo. On playing a second character I opted to try the co-op gameplay and it is extremely enjoyable and sometimes a lot more tense relying on other people. There is a great deal of camaraderie felt with the people your playing the missions with.\n\nCustomisation:\nYou have a great deal of customisation options over the character you create. There is a wide array of clothes/hair/tattoos etc you can equip your runner with. You really identify that this is your guy. There is also a heap of these which are unlocked through the game through RNG item drops so you can chase your perfect outfit if you so desire.\nOntop of that the game has several customisable skill trees you can spend your skill points/Karma into so if you want to play a Decker moonlighting as mage who is a male troll with high heels...go for it!\n\n\nLore:\nThe Shadowrun universe is very deep and far reaching. Characters in this game such as your fixer/Mr. Johnson has made appearances in previous Shadowrun novels/sourcebooks. It feels great playing in a universe which such an expansive back-story it feels these characters are in this city for a reason not just because it was made that way.\n\n\nCommunity:\nThe community in this game is very open and friendly for the most part; the ingame chat is not full of the sort of things you would see in the Barrens chat of World of Warcraft. People seem genuinely friendly and helpful if you ask for it.\n\n\nDevelopers:\nThe Developers/Community Managers at Cliffhanger are frequently seen on the steam forums replying to posts as well as the official shadowrun forums. They seem genuinely interested in Shadowrun universe itself for the most part and wanting to help make the game a success.\n\n\nProblematic Points\nLag\nUpon release this game experienced problems with lag between actions. The reasoning for this being that this game is online only. However, it has greatly improved from release and while its still persists partly it is being worked on and everyone is being kept informed. During early access which I played prior to the game this was not a problem so sadly for the Developers this only started since release. Patches have been churned out frequently and sever restarts are happening to prevent it becoming a problem.\n\n\nUnbalanced Classes\nSome classes such as the rigger seem unbalanced for the moment where at some points it feels definitely OP to play as one. In that same sense only 2 character controlled minions are allowed in one group which affect the summoner class also. Causing problems if two riggers/ or a summoner and a rigger is in the same group. However, this is being discussed with a community and headway is being made on what to do to address this problem in the forums.\n\n\nMission vareity\nIn the context of a tactics grid RPG there is only so much you can do; the missions currently boil down to the following:\nKill all the enemies.\nFind x and leave.\nStop x enemies from going to the exit point.\nExplore x and continue\nAccomplish x objective with x turns\nPersonally I don't mind that as the story and enemy variety makes up for the current mission shortcomings although honestly the enjoying the combat on my end is a big part in not being bothered by the above.\n\n\nEnd Game\nThe game is quite lengthy and enjoyable ride till the end of the story missions. Currently however there is no repeatable missions or anything to do other than stand in the hub and talk. You can get invites from other runners and join a co-op and run with them on a mission they are doing if you want your Shadowrun fix. However, if you group with low levels you essentially are too OP for the enemies. Although some people willingly do this to unlock extra Karma so may not be a downside for some people.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nPersonally I find this game highly enjoyable to play and not made a secret that I find the setting and lore very interesting personally. If you love Shadowrun this is probably a no-brainer. If you are not so inclined to the universe yet I'd still say this is worth a punt or if you want to investigate further watch one of the numerous lets plays of the game and see if this looks like something you would enjoy. It definitely a game you can play solo if you like a game that's not going to hold its punches if you play sloppy. In that token its also perfectly fine to play co-op with friends or hell make some new ones like I have playing this game. More content is going to be churned out for this game in the long-run including endgame content. They've made a hell of a enjoyable game so far so I can't wait to see where they go with it.","May 6, 2015","true","55.4"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

The most important aspect, to me, is that the devs have proven themselves to listen to the community's feedback, which makes me feel my time spent providing feedback is worthwhile, even though the game doesn't deliver the experience of a full-fleshed Shadowrun game just yet (although it comes closer with every update). People who are excited by the idea that their feedback will help shape Shadowrun Online should definitely look into the early access version - people who'd rather spend their time playing a polished, final version of the game and do not care too much to raise their opinion should probably wait a little longer.

Before I get more requests.\nthis is NOT a review.\n\nContents of the game consist of 4 missions and a 'pvp' map. Missions last around 5-10minutes.\nDialog before and after missions does feel like shadowrun but will need more fleshing out in future updates. Banter between party members is minimal. The voice over work is rather average but the rest of the music and soundfx fit the game and environments well.\nCharacters and npcs have issues turning directions until they stop moving or face a new cover. Amusing as most seem to strafe around backwards. Game scripts failed on me 3 times with npcs completely stopping in their tracks forcing a mission restart (known problem).\nUser interface and fonts currently do not scale correctly for higher resolutions. You are left with odd sized buttons that still have a few placeholder images at work.\nGlobal chat that cannot be disabled but can be hidden.\nRNG needs to be tweaked.\n\nSeems like all negatives but it has enough positives that it should really turn into something nice. I would suggest that currently "antisquad' is further along in development and quite the bargain price if you need a turnbased fix. Personally I picked up the deluxe editon of SRO and don't regret it at all. Just advising if you don't have the cash to throw around it's better spent elsewhere, for now. :)\nDefinitely give Shadowrun Returns and the wonderful dragonfall expansion a go first and foremost.\n\nGuessing, I would give it about 3-6months for a reasonably enjoyable product with some decent content. Maybe 10-12months for a 'finished product'. Voting as recommended for now with a proper review/update when it's polished up and more content is added in future.\n\nCheers folks.","March 31, 2014","true","3.4"," 34 of 58 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","34","58","0","0"

I have to admit, that Shadowrun Chronicles makes me feel good. Turn based game with a lot of Shadowrun lore in it. Nice missions for a nice game. Yes I know it's not an open world game but it's a good game for people who want to play a game which is not that time consuming.\nCommunity hub works pretty well, missions are possible to play with your NSC gang if you have no player group, skill tree is nice for the beginning. I really hope we will see some more special missions later and not only the street runner quests.\nI could imagine that we will see some more decker or hacker quests in the future, would be absolutely great.

I ran across it when Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall were out awhile, and really loved those.  This one is a bit different, and it may be unfair to compare this with those.  Different companies involved, different approaches.\n\nOverall, I do like it a lot.  Gives me the Shadowrun "feel".  Now I haven't gotten too far into it, so maybe I'm reviewing this premmaturely, but the game is a great turn-based game, and pretty challenging.  The AI has its moments, but is pretty smart, which is a refreshing change from a lot of other games out there.  Graphics are nice.  Music has that "feel" too.\n\nOne other thing I'll mention is that I normally like games that are more single-player focused.  I was told by one of the developers and vets out there that this is a multi-player (co-op) kind of game, that CAN be played like a single player if you want (instead of playing with a live human being, you can just sub a henchman, or AI, as your partner).  For what little time I have to play, that works out perfectly fine for me, and so far doesn't seem to be a problem.\n\nWhat people interested in single player MUST know though, is that whether you are co-oping or playing "single player", you MUST be connected to the internet.  There is no offline!  To many, like me, that's not a big deal.  I'm always connected.  But one drawback I have found out already, is that because you are playing with other players in a hub area, you WILL fight lag.  Hopefully once time passes and the devs get things more stabilizied, there will be little-to-no-lag.  But right now, there are times when I click on something and it can take upwards of 10-30 seconds for the command to be executed.  Other times it runs perfectly smoothly.  So be aware of this!\n\nBut I would overall recommend it...","April 29, 2015","true","191.9"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zimbabwe_pete/recommended/267750/","zimbabwe_pete","AoD Zimbabwe Pete","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zimbabwe_pete/","220 products in account","First off, let me say: THE LAG IS GONE! YAY!\n\nNow that i have that out of my system...\n\nShadowrun Chronicles has come a LONG way from the original mission i played back in april of 2014, during the first days of early access.\n\nI weigh heavily on the likeness to the pen and paper, as i was introduced to this franchise while it was only a tabletop dice game, so im a bit bias to the IP. -Fair Warning-\n\nWhile easily shuffled under the blanket of "XCOM" and "FF Tactics" games, this one shines on its own, at the very least because of the Shadowrun brand. Gameplay mechanics are basically the same as those mentioned: Move to cover, preferably while flanking the enemy, shoot, and hope your enemy doesnt have enough AP left to move in for a cheap critical attack (Hoping they add an overwatch system sometime).\n\nWhile not completely like the pencil and paper classes (your "background" actually has more to do than just modifiers in combat in the P&P.) They have done a decent job of making basic skill trees, each with thier own special perks, though at this point they are a bit limited (10 "levels").\nIf i remember correctly from my tabletop days, Karma was REALLY hard to come by. In this, not so much. You get around 7 or 8 karma per storyline mission. Making those 10 levels of skills easy to come by if you have friends to rerun missions with. Not a game breaker, but it limits your character progression/ available skills as you can attain a full 10/10/10/10 before even getting close to the end of the game thus far.\nIm ok w/ the streamlining of the combat system and abilities (for now). Your choice from the onset is 2 main attack skills, I.E. Assault Weapons and Blades, or Decking and Blunt, etc.\nBUT, you can also have 2 Casting skill sets if you feel like being behind the lines all day, like a traditional MMO Squishy. Not reccomended for the newer players. Im not even going to attempt it till they flesh out the casting/ rigging/decking system.\n\nAs you advance your character through the story, your main 4 skills will be the defining factor in your characters abilities. While you can put your Karma into whatever skills you want, you want to focus on your 2 main attacks (guns/ swords/ casting/decking/rigging) and splitting the rest of your points between Mind and Body. You can make an uber toon who can cast one mission then swap out and be a frontline bullet sponge the next, as long as you have invested the points into the skills and have the correct item equipped. Case in point: i started a summoner, and put some points into casting. i equipped what i THOUGHT was a summoning totem. Got into battle and was only able to use my caster skills.\nREAD THE ITEMS BEFORE CLICKING READY. Nothing worse thasn hearing your party griping about the dumbass who cant cast the buff we needed is no good.\n\nThe story is getting pretty good so far. Not going to spoil anything, but just be ready to fight a LOT of dogs. A LOT.\nPretty run of the mill storyline, if youre familiar with the twists and turns involved in a good Shadowrun. Getting to point B from point A doesnt always involve the easiest path, and usually there is a few steps between A&B to add some drama and opportunity to get some decent loot.\n\nGameplay is getting better, now that the lag is almost completley gone. I play with friends (up to 3 buddies at a time. 4 player co-op is where its at!), so its still a bit on the laggy side, but thats mainly due to everyone being able to move at the same time (your team, then enemy team), so you click somewhere, your buddy does too; its hangs up a bit to figure out who gets to move there first. Other than that, the gameplay is as solid as any other Tactical game ive played thus far.\n\nGraphics:\nThey could be a bit cleaner, but ill gladly sacrifice a bit of polish for being able to spin the camera around to see the map from different angles, like this game does. I would love to see a POV addition (just for targeting), just to settle my complaints about what my toon can actually see vs what i think he can...\n\nEquippable items/ clothing:\nMeh. Lots of clothing options, so you are pretty much guaranteed to not look exactly like the dude standin next to you.\nGuns/ Weapons:\nI really hope there is more levels of guns and such to buy after the point im at. ive had the same gun and sword for the last 7 missions. The enemies get more HP, i still do the same amount of damage.\nCyberware:\nWould love to see more cyberware options, as well as higher prices on said items. its kinda cheesy to be able to do a few runs and be able to afford to replace arms and legs for under 15K Nuyen. AND for over 2 essence. I dont know how many P&P fanboys agree with me that the essence system is garbage, (but effective for the blatant PvP skill tree setup this game is leaning towards). I mean a full essence for a datajack? frrrrt chummer... Even by the second edition rules a basic cyberarm replacement was only going to run you 1 essence, with only a .1-.4 additional essence loss for bonuses on the arms. Yes, point 1 to point 4 essence. not 2 full essence for a basic arm/ leg/head/torso upgrade.\nPrices for cyberware... jeebus drekking crust my chummer... In Shadowrun, cyberware was supposed to be expensive and hard to come by, making the struggle to be the best chromejockey out there; a bit tougher.\n\nAs for Decking and Rigging.... oh boy.. heres where i have some complaints:\nRigging:\nThey have boiled/ dumbed down those classes into basic caster types. yes, CASTERS. You attain your Bots through your rigging skill tree. you dont buy them like items, so basically evey rigger has the same bots available, just depending on what skills your points are in is dependant on what bots are stronger. Yeah... So basically Riggers are Techno Shaman.\nHackers:\nugh... just ugh. There is NO MATRIX in this game. Thatrs right. if you played Dragonfall or Shadowrun Returns as a Decker, be ready to be rendered ineffiecient in Chronicles. Your role as a decker basically boils down to being a Techno Caster. Buff your party, and mark your enemies. Not that decking is not needed. As you attain better skills, the mark ability will help out your party more and more, I.E. Salvo 2 (Assault Guns ability) gives you a bonus burst if attacking a Marked enemy. Dont quote me on this, but i think that each weapon skill set has an ability that bonuses on marked targets. Comes in handy when youre facing an enemy with 50+ HP.\n\nMusic/ sound\nGood for what it is. The voice acting, while sporadic, is well done; though id like to see an option for different voices based on character race/sex. Kinda funny to hear the same voice when i play a Dwarf as when i play an elf..\nThe music is pretty decent. i turn it down not only since i stream but also to hear everything else going on. this games sound isnt quite optimized. its still a bit loud, regardless of settings. Sound effects are well done. Guns sound like guns, swords make the swooshing noise a sword usually makes in games.\n\n\nOverall, I would say this game is running a solid 8/10.\nWhile i base that soley on the things i HOPE they add, its not a bad thing. I am well aware that they plan on doing a lot more with the game.\nI just hope, for thier sakes, that they lean more towards the full skill sets from the P&P version of Shadowrun. I mean, they give you current P&P rules and an adventure book (this games story!) in PDF format for buying the Deluxe/ RPG package. Why would they NOT give you the skills from that eventually?\n\nTL;DR version:\nBuy this game.\nIts fun, and improving week by week.\nCan be Solo'd, but running with 3 of your friends is where the game is at its finest and funnest.","May 10, 2015","true","64.4"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

The interface is simplistic, and an understanding of the Shadowrun background is not required, though, it can enhance the enjoyment of many aspects of the game, such as dialogue and storyline.

Sure, the Harebrained Schemes titles are far better RPG and single player games - of course they are, that's what they were designed for! Boston Lockdown is simply about four mates getting their co-op on Xcom-style in the Shadowrun universe. I know Xcom is over-used as a comparison in reviews for isometric turn-based games, but in this case the similarity runs deeper than the format. Boston Lockdown uses a skill system which is akin to the way you advance troops in Xcom. You equip your character with 2 weapons, each of which opens a corresponding skill tree. Advancement on a skill tree offers many either/or decisions at given levels, so you must choose wisely as there is no going back. Yes, it's pretty simplistic - but nuanced enough in the choices you have to make as you invest in the trees to feel rewarding. Synergising your skills with the people you run with is pleasing, too. I think if one views this game as having more in common with a title like Helldivers, it would better serve. Don't bother with pick-up-groups, just get three of your pals and work the campaign together, arguing about who goes first during your action phase or whether that grenade was meant to bounce off that wall.\n\nTo surmise, I played pen&paper Shadowrun RPG in the late 80s and this is the closest I've felt to actually doing a run with my buddies since.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ledeir/recommended/267750/","ledeir","ledeir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ledeir/","522 products in account","SHORT VERSION\nSRC is a fun game with a decent story. Where else are you going to find a story that starts by having a Dragon crash into Fenway and cause a zombie uprising?\n\nIf you like easy to learn turn-based games and have a group of friends to play with, you should give this a go. Although solo play (with internet connection) is supported, there are better single player titles available. Despite that, the story is still worth experiencing.\n\nWant to know more? Read on!\n\n---------------\nFULL REVIEW\n\nShadowrun Chronicles traveled a long and rocky road to release. They had a huge problem with lag during their release week and their final product isn't what a lot of people imagined. Despite that it is a welcome addition to the Shadowrun license and provides a long awaited multi-player experience.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nSRC is a strategy game with four player co-op support. The gameplay is easy to learn yet unforgiving of poor tactics. There are no interrupts or reactions - the player goes then the AI reacts. Each unit can do up to two actions but attacking may end that unit’s turn earlier. A good summary would be X-Com Light.\n\nEach character has a handful of abilities determined by the weapons they equip. A PC can equip two while the NPCs each get just one. Using two different weapon types will give you more options while using two of the same will let you use specific actions more often.\n\nI suggest diversifying! Certain dual wield combos are game-breakingly powerful. *cough* dual wielding riggers *cough*\n\n---------------\n\nCHARACTERS\nThis game pretends to be an RPG, but the progression is too linear for that. At least you have the choice of several fantasy races as well as clothing and appearance options. You start out with a LOT of clothing choices and they are the most common item drop. A clothing shop will also be implemented in the future.\n\nThere are 11 different weapon and skill trees allowing you to choose different play styles. Unfortunately within a weapon tree you only get a few choices which leads to little variety. At least the body and mind skill trees require you to choose between two options at each tier.\n\n---------------\n\nSTORY\nTheoretically our actions will impact the Pen and Paper Shadowrun universe. I can't imagine how as I am in the final act and the plot has been completely linear so far. There are ZERO choices in what to say or do.\n\nThat being said, if you don’t mind being railroaded the story is interesting and provides a good introduction to the world of Shadowrun.\n\nMy big complaint is that the story starts with an “amnesia escape mission” and then the rest of the game is a flashback. At least the epilogue, and the promised future missions, should be back in the present!\n\n---------------\n\nGRAPHICS\nThough some people have complained about the art style I am very happy with the graphics. I keep playing, hoping for crits, so I can get good screenshots of my character during the crit closeup. The maps themselves look excellent as well. It's a shame the maps aren't larger and that several are reused.\n\n---------------\n\nAUDIO\nMany of the NPCs have voice-overs with rather obvious Boston accents. Surprisingly, as a Boston local, they are well done. Regrettably due to their low budget, you do not have a choice for your own voice and that breaks the immersion for me. As for those who can’t handle the Boston accents, don’t worry, you can skip the audio and just read the text.\n\n---------------\n\nREPLAYABILITY\nIn its current state there is NO replayability. You cannot play previously completed missions without rolling up a new character or finding another player who wants your help.\n\nCliffhanger has plans to add a PVP mode and more end game content, but for now once you play through you are stuck waiting for an update. On the plus side, a single play through can take a sizable amount of time.\n\nOver all it’s worth playing! Its a much better multi-player option than a certain Shadowrun FPS.","May 19, 2015","true","52.6"," 19 of 32 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","19","32","0","3"

Whether it lives up to that or not will most likely depend on things outside of what we've seen in this Early Access appetizer.\n\nThey don't hold your hand.  You've got big, stylized icons that are fairly intuitive, and most of the powers associated with your magic/weapons have useful tooltips with what you need to know.  The characters bark very quick recommendations for what you should be going for, but those disappear quite quickly and don't stick around in any obvious accessible format.  That's fine for right now, as the only elements that objects in the environment provide are 'will this give me cover' or 'can I shoot this'.  Movement options are done with a nice color-in-color effect to determine whether it'll take part of your character's turn or all of it, which is an appreciated touch.  So far, most objectives are go here, shoot things that are shooting at you, then shoot the things that aren't but can be targeted.  Nuanced morals-driven narrative delve into the Sixth World it ain't, chummer.  But for demoing the combat mechanics, we ain't asking for much.\n\nThe combat is brutal, bordering on arbitrarily cruel.  If you're outside of cover, you're likely gone in one or two shots.  One of the characters has an impressive damage mitigation power, but the cooldown/recharge is too long to rely on it.  Even in cover, 'shrapnel'/spall can eat away at your health, and sometimes cover just doesn't seem to help you as much as you'd think.  Enemies use it well, for the most part.  I dread the appearance of AoE spells or grenades in their toolkit.\n\nEnemies have a nasty habit of spawning right on top of you based on event triggers, and since triggering the spawn is usually something that costs you your turn, this is a bad thing.  Overall, the missions seem like they want you to beat your head against a few failures so that you can go in knowing everything before you win; this doesn't bode well.  Hope this gets refined a bit more.\n\nDo I recommend it?  That's a very tough call.  It's Shadowrun, and the team seems to enjoy the cyberpunk aesthetic and tactical combat.  It's a guarantee that I'll get it.  I'll have to hold off on recommending it for anybody else right now, though.","March 31, 2014","true","3.9"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

That said..\nThis is an absolute failure, multiplayer is so horrid its not even comparable to the singleplayer games's mechanics.\n\nCharacter customization is non-existant, no skilltrees, no arsenal of weapons and spells to choose from, no racial differences besides body size and skin color.\nIn addition, No dialogue, No story not even a series of mission or interesting challenges just a few very short maps.\n\nThis game has received over 1mil in funding from several sponsors (excluding kickstarter). After almost a year in 'alpha' still no new content or added features like the aforementioned above.\n\nPhrases like; 'But its still in alpha/beta' Have been used too often now to justify lackings.\nI have been in over 20 pc alphas and betas and it has taught me that when a publisher slaps on the alpha or beta tag, they believe the game is nearly finished.\n\nWhat you see now is the core game upon which a development team MAY build on, I say MAY because there is no guarantee they will significantly add/change anything. They could very easily now just focus on bug fixing. Don't be naive, Don't be a dumb consumer, Do not support this blantant attempt at milking more money from what was their fanbase.\n\nPersonally, before the start of alpha i paid only 10euro's to them to gain acces to the alpha, there were donation options leading up to 10.000 . That and experience caused me to be very cautious. I feel very disapointed, once again i made the mistake of hoping.\n\nConclusion;\nThey should have just added multiplayer functions to the singleplayer games.","November 7, 2014","false","87.8"," 58 of 108 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","58","108","0","0"

It's not overly complex and combat is fun, so if you're looking for a linear tactical turn-based game with a low barrier of entry, this might be a good choice. However, there is a very annoying lag going on every time you click something, and I can't recommend the game until this is fixed.\n\nUPDATE 04/30/2015: The game is easy to get into, but it's pretty challenging, which is a plus. It's not really fair to compare it to Shadowrun Returns, but if you're coming from SR, imagine that game without the role-playing aspects and with a total focus on combat (including online multiplayer capabilities). In fact, this game even succeeds in a few areas where SR/FD fall flat: I've played SR as a decker and was frustrated because my abilities weren't very useful in combat, but deckers in Shadowrun Chronicles have some pretty interesting skills to affect the flow of the battle and are way more fun to play than in SR.\n\nI don't really like the voices, but thankfully the developers allow us to mute the characters. Music fits the game pretty well up to now, I even lowered the sound effects (which are also good). The graphics are good but lack polish, as you'll see lots of clipping (it gets REALLY weird at times), but what really matters is the action, and it looks solid.\n\nChronicles has a few rough edges, but the core of it (the combat) is fun, deep and works fine. There is still lag while I write this, but the developers are hard at work on the game and I believe this and other minor problems will soon be fixed. If you like turn-based combat games, like the Shadowrun universe and is not expecting much in terms of exploration and role-playing, you'll probably have a blast with this. It's still a "not recommended" because the lag is still a thing, but as soon as it's fixed I'll change this into a "recommended".","April 28, 2015","false","10.9"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","20","35","0","6"

There are some great ideas in combat, and the art direction is very good.  The camera, persepctive, and color is better, I would say, than Shadowrun Returns.  The grid-tactics style seems more well done than in SRR as well.  The writing is interesting, and the voice acting is quite good.\n\nAll that said, there is almost nothing there yet.  There are two charactes, four maps, and no options.  There is really no taste of what this game will become.  I'm going to give this game a yes recommendation, because it can be great.  I believe that it will be great.  But for now, it's not great, because it's not really anything.\n\nOnce this game is even half finished, I think this will be worth your time.  The direction it's headed in is enjoyable, and there are lots of things to appreciate here.  The game itself just isn't one of them yet.  Keep your eye on it though.\n\nPost-launch review:\nJust some quick notes and changes on the former Shadowrun Online: SRChronicles is an intensely interesting concept for a game at its current stage.  The look is fantastic (better than sister game Shadowrun Returns), the tactical gameplay is solid, and the atmosphere is awesome.  Right now, the servers are laggy as a mug, but they're working to fix it, so that should improve reasonably soon.  The character customization is still a little light as well, but it's expanding from the beta in a good way.\n\nThe worst thing, at the moment, is the relatively light interaction avaliable from the characters or areas.  Shadowrun is a world filled with garbage and rats, but the streets in this game have almost no interactable environments at this point.  While the characters there are interesting and unique, they don't have very much to say or do right now.  Things are just a little to linear from a story standpoint.\n\nThat aside, I still had a blast with this game.  Once it's a ltitle more lived in, I think this will be THE definitive modern Shadowrun game.","May 8, 2014","true","14.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","2"

I think the others address the game mechanic issues and the game being a year late. My major problem however, is the ending. I litterally had to try it 40 times and then I just quite. Endings should be hard and death may happen (like Dark Souls Two.. and I died a few times in Shadowrun Returns: DMS), but in the kickstarter video this company claimed they had experience in making video games. If so, you should tailor the level of difficulty (when there are no med packs) and know a little bit about game theory. This game is fundamentally flawed. Why would you advertise a full 3D game (kudos on the art btw), and then lock the screen as if its 2D isomophic. I thought you were working with the Shadowrun Returns team? I wanted this game to work sooo much, but now I'm going back to hoping someone makes a GTA V Shadowrun mod this summer. You can't advertise open, persistent, player driven worlds when you can't even make an ending enjoyable for the average gamer (and actually I consider myself a hardcore gamer, so I'm not sure how many people actually beat the ending).","April 17, 2014","true","4.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Despite the small amount of content I had a blast for at least two hours. The setting, mission plot and chatter between characters seems very in keeping with the source material, even if the ork's voice is a bit irritating.\n\nThe few bugs I encountered (chat window not scrolling correctly, game seeming to stall when changing to enemy turn (rarely) and the armour spell occassionally not  actually applying armour to it's target) are surprisingly few for an alpha or especially a pre-alpha game.\nA lot of the damage and cover mechanics seem unbalanced, but that is of course issues to be addressed in beta. I suspect you'll see a lot of reviews for this game in the coming day that sway between people praising it's potential and hoping it stays on track, like myself, and people who seem to buy every early access game and review them yet never come to understand that early access/alpha/beta means incomplete, test phase, "things are going to be super broken, yo" etc. So take those reviews with a grain of salt.\n\nTL;DR.

As an avid fan, how bad could this be?\n\nThis is a game that feels as an example when Developers don't seem to be fans as well. The game lacks a soul. There are bits I felt the game did right. I was happy to slap a halloweener's face paint on. However, the voice acting actually detracts from the immersion for being so bad. The stories aren't anything that really engages you.\n\nThere are even parts where it doesn't even take into account the character you selected when speaking of your character. Make a female? They call you "Him" and "Sir" and junk. Just shows the sub par quality of the game. Is it a piece of #($*(#*? Not really, but if you want tactical shooters, X-COM blows this out of the water.

I ran my own campaign for years, and have played a few of the video games released for the universe. After playing the game for a few hours, it is unfortunate that I struggle to find any redeeming qualities to be had in order to give Shadowrun Chronicles a positive review.\n\nAfter loading up the game and starting, I was assigned my first mission and when choosing to go do it, I found myself stuck at a load screen for minutes unable to do anything but choosing an option to exit the game. I had to reload the game three times before the mission would actually load. A few hours in during a mission into a stadium, the game got stuck on the enemy's turn. I can only guess the cause was me closing a gate, trapping the enemy on the other side, and the game was stuck trying to process a way to have the enemy be able to path out of the enclosed room.\n\nCharacter creation is simple, though choices made are permanant, without the ability to respec. Considering Cliffhanger Productions decided to not use the standard stats and skills common to Shadowrun, but use a system of their own creation, this is quite the folly. Made a mistake with choosing one skill over another while leveling up? Too bad. Reroll the character. Character portraits are woefully limited, around four different onces per race. On a positive note, clothing customization is huge, and you can find more later on in game, at least allowing a unique look for youself.\n\nVoice acting is horrible. It sounded more like Cliffhanger opted to hire a highschool drama class, instead of actual voice actors. It does not help that the writing is mediocre.\n\nCombat is simple, and not overly challenging. This is not XCOM, or Valkyria Chronicles level of tactics here. Little thinking and strategy is needed in order to progress through a mission. Other than a few moments of bad luck with the RNG, my team made it through without a scratch.\n\nThough the game encurages co-op, you can use henchmen for solo play. About once an hour, hechmen are rotated on the roster, giving you a wide option. This would be alright, if it wasn't for henchmen being randomly assigned skills for your account. As such, I did not have a single one with the ability "Organ Harvesting".\n\nGraphics aren't that great. Normally, graphic quality doesn't bother me. However, especially when you zoom in, you can really notice the low rez textures. In general, this looks like a game that comes from the days of the PS1. Characters have blocky faces, hands that look like baseball gloves, and everthing look flat.\n\nMuch like XCOM, Shadowrun Chronicles has a Action Camera that plays randomly when you're taking an action.

I like to call the shots, so to speak... I like to have a Shaman, a Spellcaster and a Rigger under my command, while I go fully Automatic.\n\nA team with 4 Autos? Doesn't work... Or one Auto and 3 Shotguns? Never.\n\nOn the top of that, I really dislike the whole "Coop" thing with a passion. I'm a bit of a misanthrope when it comes to dealing with people in online games.\n\nSo there's my rant regarding Coop, and most of all, regarding a game genre that just doesn't work as a Coop.\n\n...\n\nNow back to SRC-BL...\n\nThis is by no means an easy game to be played, especially if you don't have previous experience in tactical turn-based games.\n\nIf this is your very first experience, then brace yourself for some angry moments. I'd recommend you first play Shadowrun Returns and/or Dragonfall in order to warm up and make the most of this one.\n\nIn a nutshell, playing this game is all about what skills you bring to the battle. One class completes the other, and you cannot possibly win a battle with a 4 Autos or 4 Melees or 4 Spells team, and so on.\n\nAt least one in your team should be able to dish out AoE attacks, also you should have one class capable of spawning extra NPCs (Rigger or Shaman). Even though Spirits and Drones are not that strong, they can still do some damage while alive and/or serve as decoys.\n\nAlso, strategy: some maps favour a "retreat to cover" strategy, where it's best to draw enemies back to narrow passages or places where you can be better positioned so you can easily ambush them with AoE while concentrating attacks on the highest HPs.\n\nIn large maps with little cover and mob waves, you might have to spread your team around or concentrate on the strongest mobs.\n\nAlways pay attention on hit chance: it's better to hide or reload rather than waste a turn attacking an enemy with less than 50% hit chance.\n\nFinally, expect having to repeat the same runs over and over. It can be quite infuriating sometimes, but learn from your mistakes and see what works the best.\n\n...\n\nNow for the +s and -s...\n\n\nThe +s\n+ The game looks pretty good.\n\n+ Your character, and NPCs involved in main quests have their own voice overs, and the acting is pretty good, also the script is well written.\n\n+ It runs very well, no lags, no glitches, no crashes, etc.\n\n+ It plays like the previous SR by Harebrained Studios. So no gameplay learning curve.\n\n+ The AI can be quite tough at times, and enemy NPCs are usually one step ahead of you in terms of gear and power. Although they can also be quite dumb too, which works in your favor.\n\n+ Storyline is ok, obviously not an original formula (Deus Ex anyone?) and you can smell the plot twists miles away, but at least it fits the SR universe with their "Iluminatti" (dragons, in this case) and big corps struggling for power and population control/reduction/etc.\n\n\nThe -s\n- No graphics adjustments and no changing key bindings. But hey, you'll be treated with 5 different adjustments for audio :)\n\n- Character skills are a bit misplaced if you ask me. Example, in "Automatics" there's a skill that gives you extra 3 hitpoints. I'm confused... shouldn't that be under "Body"?\n\n- Weapon/Armor availability is terrible, sometimes you have nothing new for ages, then suddenly the vendors are flooded with good but expensive gear you can't afford.\n\n- No respec. You spent karma on the wrong skill, you're stuck with it.\n\n- Difficulty curve goes from gentle to steep between missions, not sure if that's a bug or a "feature". An example is the very last mission. More like you are fighting a god rather than a boss. So save your nails for that one.\n\n- There are no "choice and consequence" scenarios. My first character ("character" I said, not "toon[www.urbandictionary.com]"...) was a Auto, now I'm playing a Spell, and I am just skipping all dialogs because I know most of it from the top of my head. Plus, I'm not even talking to NPCs anymore (except when they have side runs), 'cause I know it's pointless and they won't have anything new for me.\n\n- The maps are pretty small and they are reused more than once in main/side missions. That and also the lack of "choice/consequence" mentioned above affects the replayability for me, in a pretty bad way.\n\n- No healing class. And no medpaks for sale at vendors. So save medpaks you either find or are rewarded with like you'd save your own.. ahem... "chastity" for that special someone. Or in this case, for that special NPC or even your own character.\n\n- Interface is unfinished and bugged. Example: you and two others finish their moves, then along comes the rigger who summons a drone. Everyone's "move bars" are filled up again, giving the impression that the enemies had their turn and then it's our turn again. Very misleading, but I got used to it now. Still, it's a bug. Other examples are: overlapped text on other elements, tiny text on certain parts that is very difficult to read.\n\n- Camera drives me crazy. You move a hench or a drone, for example, and have the camera at its destination because you want to see what's going on there. But instead of staying there, the camera moves back to the next hench. That gives plenty of possibilities for misclicking or even wasting your turn altogether. Plus, the way the camera keeps moving from one character to another across the map gives me eye seizures sometimes. Annoying.\n\n- Kill/Critical cameras. You can't disable them on the Settings. They last for ages. You can't take control while they are playing. It takes your view off the battlefield and you miss out on a lot of important stuff (like seeing who's got hit, who's dead, etc) while you are stuck watching the stupid camera angle. Very annoying.\n\n- Apparently, the henchmen (NPCs you can hire if you want to play solo) list is composed of other people's characters when they are offline, and they are scaled up or down according to your current level. That would be ok, if not for the fact that there aren't many people playing this game, so your choice of henchmen is a bit too limited. Me, for example, I have to always choose the same Spellcaster (Batshit), the same Rigger (Thunderb0tz) and the same Shaman (Angelica), because they are quite possibly the only 3 players who didn't go for either Automatics, Pistols or Shotguns.\n\n\nThe verdict\nThere are a few bugs and annoyiances here and there, but nothing that is really game breaking.\n\nWeighing the +s and -s (and I know that there are way more "-s" in my list), this is still a pretty good game and you shouldn't miss it if you are a fan of the SR series.\n\n7/10","July 19, 2015","true","60.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

If you're used to Shadowrun RPG rules, some of the mechanics might throw you for a loop, but it doesn't take away anything from the game.\n\nThe best part of the game is the co-op system.

The core, a co-op turn-based strategy game, is loads of fun.  Decisions about where to post up and what skill to use are meaningful, and enemy variety requires you to pay attention to armor types and supportive roles.  If you have to take a henchmen (either you or your co-op partner), these decisions are also meaningful and are best carefully considered to maximize your effectiveness.\n\nHowever, I must say that the skill trees in the game are somewhat uninspired, and you may find yourself getting a little tired of almost the exact same hub world and quest givers after spending upwards of 20 hours in the game.  Lastly, the Boston accent is just awful, in general.  I understand why it's there...but it's awful.","May 6","true","48.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I like the idea that we can try out different builds for each character and class and to see how they work with others. So far the game for me has been a excellent gaming time.

(means: the translation is well done, too!)\n\nI like the idea of fast entering missions via a central HUB where all  mission  starts, it skips the anoying grinding through landscapes and brings players fast to the action.\n\nDuring the runs itself, a mouse-click can get a team from getting through untouched to getting wrecked without mercy - i like that.

Might be a good idea to show up resulting stats (hit/crit chance, armor, software levels, at all kind of gear) also passive stats like being harder to hit and such things would be nice be shown at the characters changing-gear window?\n\nFor the rest I'm sure the Devs doing a good job by adding content and gear, keep it up!","May 17, 2015","true","60.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

You have a number of background options when making your character, and then when you gain Karma from missions, unlock elements of the skill trees with that. The missions are not very easy, which keeps them interesting - I tried one mission 5 times with one setup, and failed, then switched a hired gun for a hired hacker made all the difference.\n\nEach skill tree basically has an associated weapon type: Blunts, Blades, Handguns do what you'd expect, but then you have Sumoning Foci and Channeling Foci for shamans and mages. However this means any character can use anything, only with as much proficiency as their allotted skills in that given weapon's skill tree allows. Weapons progress in power as you progress through the game, as does cyberware.\n\nMaking teams is presently mostly over global chat, and goes quite well (although some people report being able to invite others, but being invited fails). There are layers of chat - Global, which is everyone on, and Hub, which is everyone on your particular "version" of the city's hub where other runners are between missions.\n\nThe voice acting is good, but odd (the opening voice lines sometimes sound like they were amateurs, but then the actors got better as the recording session went on or something). The music is nice, though some more sound assets for blown-up robotic enemies would be nice as well. Visually it's quite rich and evocative of the environments depicted. The story isn't spectacular but it's the "main" campaign for now with others planned for later release.\n\nCons:\n- Once you've done the missions, you know where everything is. I don't think a MMO/(actual)RPG is a thing.\n- There are (as of May 4) still lag issues, which I'm only mentioning because it wouldn't be a helpful review otherwise. The developers have made a long statement about it and what they are doing about it. During some hours it's not that bad (nighttime NA).\n\nWith it going on sale after release there is little reason to wait to purchase it (assuming a turn-based Shadowrun-set team game interests you) because of the lag - just wait to play it if it gets too much. I just mention this because this is an online game with no subscription fees, or in-game purchasables, whose developers made a mistake in their server tests. It bothers a certain contientious side of me to think all the time and investment into the game and its infrastructure would lose out to vocal consumers that expect flawlessness in every way from a small game company that has turned out a high quality product in all other aspects.\n\nEdit: Lag is fixed!","May 4, 2015","true","52.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

You can play single player or multiplayer, but the multi-player aspect is where the game really shines.  It is a nice refresher from other MMORPG because being turn based, there doesn't seem to be as much of a focus on DPS etc.  The game is fairily short, but has a lot of replay value (again because of the multiplayer community).  The storyline is pretty good, though not as in depth as other RPGs.  This works out well because it gives plenty of room or mulitplayer interaction.  There is more content planned for release (hence the "Chronicles" part of the title) which would expand it even more.  While no reflection on the quality of the game itself, the company is at present having some issues which will undoubtably slow down the update of content, but the company has also said that the game will continue to be supported, even though they have to cut down the staff working on it.","May 31, 2015","true","110.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The artwork is great, and the music is spot on.  I feel confident that I will recommend this game when it's done.\n\nAll that being said, the development has a long way to go on the peripherals that are going to make this a great game:  the away-from-combat storylining, the character customization, and just general depth that can (and I'm confident) will be incorporated.

Never played table-top version, did played (and enjoyed) Dragonfall and Dead Man Switch, and this is different... but COOL!\n\nCyberpunk. Archetypes. Intrigues. Multiplayer, if one wants it, or single-player, if preferred.\n\nEDIT: Cross over Intrigues. Perhaps in the future. I don't want this to be misleading, story IS linear.\n\nAnd MULTIPLAYER IS THE HEART OF THE GAME - community is probably THE BEST online community I've met. No badmouthing, all-knowing pre-teens who critisize your every move (both good and bad) - in short:\n\nMAJOR LACK OF TYPICAL ONLINE COMMUNITIES FLAWS.\n\nPeople will enjoy MP, and more importantly, it's done in such a way that player level (or skill, or experience) really doesn't matter - players are awarded for helping new players - furthermore, it's the main source of post-campaign character development.\n\nOriginal, continued:\n----------------------------\n\nCould go into a story-telling techniques, and how it's somewhat inferior to Dragonfall (and still adequate for a game, face it - how many good games you just skipped through dialogues) - but won't...\n\nProbably differs substantially from table-top and its strict codexes - to acheive balance for SP and not to rely on some game-master to 'honour' players choices - but doesn't matter...\n\nIt's still in development process, but honestly - couldn't notice anything *seriously* lacking, so it will likely get better and with more options.\n\nDon't know about endgame yet - it is usually VERY important to me, but from what I understood, it's just started with first mission. I'll edit this later...\n\n[EDIT]:\n\n200+ hours of game and still can't get enough. Of the endgame, that is, campaign is not overly long, but HARD for a single player, and endgame is consisting of:\na) helping new players to pass the campaign\nb) doing the challenges\n\nGame is updated, people would like it to be more often, but independent studios don't have the luxury of huge fundings.\n\n"Game is not finished" is a common 'reviewer' whine. It's not true. Game *could* have more content, *should* have less bugs - but it IS very, very playable and lots of people enjoy it. Me too.\n\n"Devs destroyed the balance" is another common 'reviewer' whine. I put reviewer in quotes, cause my firm believe is that person writing it should know something about the balance. It's PvE game, some skills are better than others, but it doesn't matter. One doesn't find 100 exactly-the-same character 'as seen on youtube', and 50 of path-less-travelled and nothing else. Runners are colourful, skills are colourful, rebalanced from time to time to 'refresh' things a bit. And it's cool. If one stopped playing after 200h because 'dual-pistol doesn't do as much damage as it did, and something else now does more' (you can switch freely, by the way), that person shouldn't write about balance. Reason - lack of competence.\n\nAnd I am looking forward to each update. And not trying to break router if I disconnect. It happens, but the game atmosphere is relaxing, the coop players doesn't get mad (someone keep controlling your character, and can finish the mission, after which you can reconnect).\n\nVery relaxing, very friendly and relaxed community... Can't see when I'll get enough of it, really...\n\n\nOriginal, continued:\n----------------------------\nAll this comes to one conclusion (and one not given lightly, not by yours truly):\n\nThis game is cool!\n\nYou could very well buy it, even for (or, indeed, BECAUSE) it's in development stage. There is a campaign, and free-character development, so it's worth at least a few replaying, even without endgame. Moreso, if engame proves good and satisfying. But I'll update this after some more playing...\n\n[EDIT]\n\nEnd-game is fulfilling enough to buy it immediatelly. After some legal/financial troubles, updates continued (hopefully, there won't be more such problems) and I know EXACTLY what I will buy for birthdays of friends who love similar games.\n\nOne more thing - game doesn't suck out all your time:\n- typical mission 5-10 minutes (nothing forces you to continue after just one)\n- 'easier' challenge - 30 minutes\n- 'harder' challenge - 45 minutes\n\nAlmost as a phone pass-time game, yet so much more depth. Of course, nothing keeps one away from playing 16h in a session.","June 23, 2015","true","866.5"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

It's fast, it's easy to play, and it really shines with 3 friends running with you.\n\nA lot of users are concerned with lag atm, but these devs certainly wear their hearts of their sleeves, and the roll-outs of patches and lines of communication from them is frankly some of the best I've seen, especially considering the small team responsible for this love letter to the universe.\n\nThe in-game community is fantastic, and you'll rarely want for someone to help you out/go on a run.\n\nThere's tons of customization options for your 'runner if you like Digital Barbie (and who doesn't!), and the freedom of choice to build a character how you want is a breath of fresh air in these times of class-based, cookie-cutter action-RPG's.\n\nBut it's the smaller things that have captured my heart. Although the game is never in danger in winning any Graphics of the Year rewards, the attention to details in the levels is something special. Glass blows out of windows as the concussion of a grenade hits them. Car alarms echo down the road if cars are shaken by explosions. Steam jets out of pipes when a stray round hits them. Music from a nightclub fades the further you pan your camera away from the door. I particularly love the way your runner will lean against a wall, SMG at the ready when you end your turn.\n\nAll in all, it's awesome stuff.\n\nBuy it, ride out the (current) technical problems, and enjoy what the future will bring!\n\n","May 9, 2015","true","81.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There is so much recycled content, such a merely passable story and some highly questionable design decisions that I can't really give this any higher praise than calling it acceptable.\n\nChronicles is only reccommendable because:\n1) It's the only Shadowrun video game you can play online.\n2) It's the closest thing to coop XCOM I've seen.\n3) It uses the Shadowrun licence. I don't think I would have played this long otherwise.\n\nI'll probably go back to this game here and there but it's only really because I want to see my coolguy character's stats maxed.\n\nIf there's ever a sequel to Chronicles it needs to improve on most of Boston Lockdown's flaws to at least bring the game much closer to what it was supposed to be... (Also the online servers need to be replaced by a matchmaking system, especially since there's no reason for this game to actually even connect to a master server besides maybe daily missions and character progression legitmancy checks before playing with others. It's even more pointless if you're playing the game alone anyway...)\n\n---\n\n\nCoop focused Xcom combat game set within a magic-enabled cyberpunk world. With your own created character you team up for missions and upgrade afterwards. In typical Shadowrun fashion characters can be a mix of a gun weilder, a swordsman, a mage, a summoner, a hacker, a cyborg, etc. Disappointingly though, the game has an almost entirely linear storyline with choices that affect almost nothing.\n\nI started with singleplayer, which is admittedly the least ideal way to play this game, player slots are replaced by controllable henchmen of your choosing but most of them seem randomly generated. I tried coop later, it's defintely a lot faster and more enjoyable since the henchmen become replaced by real people with control over their own character(s). It might be awkward to figure out your team's tactics if you're playing with strangers but if you're playing with a friend over skype you can just discuss who takes the first shot and where. Either way the game honestly seems well set up for quick sessions of feeling like a tactical badass, which seems to be the intention.\n\nJust don't expect the game to be anywhere near as deep (or polished) as Dragonfall or Returns and you should be fine.","March 7","true","42.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

From 1E to the SNES version to SRR to this. When SRR came out I played through it and thoroughly enjoyed the gameplay. What I wished for was co-op gameplay and Boston Lockdown provides that. Now, as far as combat goes it's about like SRR - point-and-click with some strategy and I will say the difficulty is a bit harder in this one (which I like). The only thing I don't like is that if I want to play single player I can't go offline and play the game. It won't work without being online. I mean, it's a live co-op so I it makes sense. I just wish that it could have an offline mode so you can play the game in case your 'net goes out or something. But to me that's the only drawback. That being said, I only have one character which is a decker. The class (or skilltree. Whichever) is pretty well done. I wouldn't know about any of the others as of yet.

It's basically simplified RPG (sometimes it's no sin at all), turn-based tactical shootout with shadowrun storyline and possible co-op - as it all stands in the game's desciption (no lying there) and that's what you're buying ;) I believe understanding this is crucial for your potential opinion on this game.\n\nDespite some minor flaws which don't spoil my fun anyhow, I appreciate quite realistic combat (where enviroment matters), in-game events, clear skills development, decent storyline and finally awesome character customization (don't tell me you did not spend first hour having fun with the character creator).\n\nI also believe players got a little to spoil ;) while most of negative opinions about this game is saying it's decent - why giving it thumbs down?

I have removed the part about Lag in my review.\n\nPros\n- Shadowrun feelings and lore well done. This is really a Shadowrun game, not a tactical game playing the cyberpunk card.\n- Missions are fun and some of them have nice twists to maintain the interest.\n- Solo mode is perfectly possible, playing coop is not mandatory. Some people complain that the henchmen (the people running with us during a mission) are weaker than the players, but it does not prevent me to succeed and have fun.\n- Customization of the character is a nice touch.\n- Developpers are pretty open and talktative in the community, so we can expect some nice updates and support for this game.\n- This is a funny and nice community. I am not a coop or MMO player at all and I was not that happy at first that the coop aspect was in the game. After a few chats and a few runs, I can say that I am happy with that point now. I still prefer solo game, but coop is okay in my newbie book.\n\nMixed\n- Story : As I've said, nice Shadowrun feel for the whole game, story, character, etc. But it's not a strong story ride as in Dragonfall.\n\nCons\n- Lack of some features. In the near future, some changes/additions should be make : a more complete character sheet, a little more NPC's to talk to, log/journal of previous missions/side-missions and story evenments so we can look back at what has be done (can help to choose an appropriate mission when looking to play coop), possibility to do re-runs for certains missions (probably the more heavy-fighting ones, so people just not farm on and on the same 2 easy missions).\n- Music. It does not compare to the awecome soundtracks of Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall. It is not bad, it fits the game and setting well (some missions have quite good music actually), but since music is a major aspect of my enjoyment in any game, I had to put it in the cons columns. YMMV, I realize this is not an important point for everyone.\n\nConclusion : Adjust your expectations accordingly (this is not Dragonfall or Shadowrun Returns and it's not a full MMO) and you will be quite satisfied with the game. I know I am and I am having a great fun playing it. Fortunately for me, the game can be played both solo and coop, so I can play whatever I want.","May 5, 2015","true","57.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I've played several other Shadowrun RPGs including the SNES, Genesis and more recent Shadowrun Returns and Shadowrun:Dragonfall.  So, I know a bit about the world and how the game is supposed to look, fell and how the mechanics should work.  And no, I won't be calling anyone a "chummer".  That's the only thing I never enjoyed about Shadowrun, characters always calling people "chummer".  I like all the other lingo, just not that.  But I, as usual, digress - on to the "review".\n\nCaveat #2:  This review sounds really negative.  I'm just old and cranky, the game's not really all that bad.  But it needs work, work that the Dev. team are actually doing.  Give those guys a break and, if you get a chance, drop by the forums and tell 'em thanks for their hard work.\n\nI can probably sum this up in a few sentences, but I'm not going to because I like Shadowrun and I think that it deserves more than a few lines. Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown is a turn-based Shadowrun Role Playing Game that I had, and still have, high hopes for.  It's just not quite there yet.\n\nIf you don't want to read the whole reveiw at least read this paragraph.  I had hoped SC:BL would play more like Dragonfall, and I really had my fingers crossed for it to play like the table-top games I used to play.  It feels like s a simplified version, one that still needs quite a bit of work, but has a lot of potential.\n\nSo, complaints.\n\nThe thing that made me shake my head the most and say "what were they thinking" in the Angry VIdeo Game Nerd voice are the frickin' robots running around (and by running around I mean that on top of the following two things they can also take a move action) that can continually repair their armour AND shoot you in the same round.  This is very early on in the game and does not bode well for late-game balance.\n\nSure, there are ways to deal with them, but if you've got one character out of the fight and the other is specialized in magic damage, that the robot is somehow completely immune to, you're gonna have a bad time.  Like I did.  If you can only do a small amount of range/melee damage you will very likely be unable to defeat the robot unless you luck out with several crits.  In a row.  There's no way to retreat out of the mission and no way I could find to do a bit of extra damage, so if you're a mage (and you can't heal with magic, by the way) you may as well re-start the mission.\n\nI also couldn't heal a downed party member (a NPC hireling, not another player) despite having both a Docwagon card and a Medkit.  I guess there's no "bleeding out" like Dragonfall has, there's alive and dead and nothing in between for your NPCs.  Only happened once that I tried to heal a NPC hireling so I'm not sure if I just missed the window of opportunity or you just can't do it.  I was there within the next round so I'm guessing you just can't do it.\n\nDeckers can do some kind of decking attacks against... well, pretty much anyone and don't need LOS to do it as long as another character can see their target.  Sure the hit percentage is bad unless they're pretty close but... it's lame.  That ability needs to go away, or at least the fact that they can do damage to anything, or at least anything I've encountered so far.  Sure it's not a lot of damage, but they're safe hiding behind a wall.\n\nI don't remember deckers being able to hack into orgainc characters and "stun" them or damage them by typing on their deck while they are not jacked in to, or remotely controlling, anything.  Deckers are there to pwn the matrix and hack security, robots, turrets, etc.  You want to deal with that Lone Star patrol that's currently firing on you then you'll probably want a mage, shaman, street samurai, rigger or, well, pretty much anything but a decker, to be attacking them.  Sure there are things a decker can do, but if you're in the middle of a desert and people are shooting at you the decker's going to want a gun, not his keyboard.\n\nSo, the development team are currently fixing a tonne of problems with the online servers, you'll get booted during missions, and you won't know if you're not paying extremely close attention to the (crappy) dialogue box.  Actually I've been booted several times for re-starts and have yet to actually see any kind of warning dialogue, message, alert, memo, etc.  Nothing.  I just get dumped out of the mission I'm on and have to re-start it.  I was actually finished one mission and got booted out.  I had to re-do the whole run.  Luckily it was short.\n\nOk, enough about that.  Next problem.  The interface .. well, it's functional but I don't like it.  The dialogue box is in a stupid place and and detracts from the game.  Make it re-sizeable and stick that  thing in a corner - out of the way, not nearly in the middle of the left side of the screen.\n\nSpeaking of ugly... the characters don't look great.  Some of them don't look BAD, but they don't look all that good either.  The selection screen at the beginning annoys me.  Use a menu, or have a nine by nine grid with small graphics of each hair/beard/accessory.  Don't make me click a frickin' arrow over and over and over.  The menu once you get in the game would be fine, just bring that to the "character creation" screen and that would be good enough.\n\nThe settings look okay.  Some of the characters and weapons look okay, too.  Overall it's decent but graphically I have to say that absolutely nothing has impressed me.\n\nThe sounds are okay, but there are annoying ambiance noises and most of the voice acting I have heard so far is about average.  Again, nothing impressive but it's functional.\n\nSo far ihave seen exactly zero "overwatch" type of skills nor any kind of "hold action options", no way to go about preparing ambushes or anything similar.  And the initiative is basically your team moves, then their team moves - which I can deal with - but I'd prefer a proper initiative order.\n\nI miss having actual attributes to work with, the mechanics are far too simple for my liking.  As noted above, I'd rather this play exactly like Dragonfall.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed how Dragonfall plays.  Sure it kind of copied the new X-Com, but that was a decent game, too.\n\nDespite all this, I like the Shadowrun universe so I'm recommending the game.  Make sure you buy it on sale if you have doubts unless you want to help the Devs.  I bought in way before it was fully released because I believe the Dev. team are dedicated to making this a good game.  It's just got a heck of a long way to go.  And on that note they've been working hard and should take a day or two off to recharge before they keep hammering away.  There's only so much you can do when you're exhausted.","May 5, 2015","true","98.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It is a very different game and although set in a Shadowrun-like universe, there are noticeable differences. The integration of Decking/Hacking as another form of "real-world" combat instead of a standalone matrix probably being the most striking example.\n\nNevertheless, after playing the game for some time I adjusted my view and moved away from expecting it to deliver a sucessor for Dragonfall. And I started to really enjoy Chronicles: It is a fun, fast-paced, round-based coop game with a strong Shadowrun flavor. I quickly came into the "just 5 more Karma, only one more run" mindset that then means another hour of playing.\n\nSure, there are still many issues with the game: The worst lags are gone by now, but there are still lots of things that feel somewhat incomplete (e.g. some stats can nowhere be checked, some descriptions are not very precise etc). The developers, however, do a great job in communicating with the players and I am quite confident that they will continue to significantly improve the game!\n\nBottomline, despite some negative points, the game is fun to play and therefore gets my recommendation!","May 10, 2015","true","218.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

SR:R is very much a successor to the '90s SNES/Genesis title in that there is a roaming mode for exploring/RPG events and a separate turn-based mode for combat/tactical moments.\n\nIn it's current Early Access state, Shadowrun Online is a series of turn-based combat missions with two characters (controlled in offline play by a singler player). Storytelling is accomplished in text-based narratives that break down the plot. In-mission, the characters delver voiced banter and commentary that is genre-accurate and well done.\n\nCombat is quick, brutal, and easy to access/figure out with an elegantly designed UI that doesn't leave many questions unanswered. Shoot your gun, ammo goes down, use an action phase to reload. Simple. The AI is sharp. Pushing to cover, hitting you hard, and making you eat drek. Expect to get greased, Chummer.\n\nGraphics are excellent. A superior engine that delivers mood and environment clearly but without being cluttered or feeling like it's on rails (which it is, really, but at least it -looks- like you have an environment outside of the combat zone).\n\nAll-in-all, a good experience.

I'll begin with the early access part of this edited review below:\n\n"Pure dogshit. I'm not even going to waste my time explaining my opinions to people on this one. avoid at all costs, do not put any of your personal finances into the game.\n\nI dont know if the game is in development, or released fully etc. If it's out in earnest, you as the developers have so much ♥♥♥♥ to sort out to make my expendature worth it. If it is not released fully yet, give up now. pure ♥♥♥♥♥."\n\nSo there that is. I don't lie and I dont mince about with my words- the game was- and was set to be- a waste of time for me from the getgo. From perhaps an hours playtime, I was bitter and angry at the waste of money I had given for a founders edition game this poor. But that would change.\n\nI didn't play for months; Following a Dev reply to my review, explaining that the game had changed considerably and was now in a far more polished state, I decided to see if shadowrun:chronicles would live up to the name of my dearly cherished RP system and game series and I can honestly say that it has. so here goes the review fo the game in its released state.\n\nI would rate the game a solid 8/10 based on the content that is available to me now. the story is intriguing and nearing the quality of the two recent re-released shadowrun games, both of which I play on my IPad. the quality of the graphics is a wierd fish for me; it is not what you would call awe-inspiring, yet the models, the maps, the effects and all of the ambience feels RIGHT for a shadowrun game and is charming. charming is the best word I could use, it charms you. playability wise, it is not only fun and smooth (excpeting the unfortunate lag which Iwill cover) but engaging and thought provoking, at once rewarding for using tactical thought and punishing when risks are taken and failed. it really makes you think, and it has a gritty, satisfying feel to acheiving objectives or kills. the character customisation is very decent, with many ways to make your character your own, both aesthetically and by means of skills and weapon choices. multiplayer matching could use a dedicated system but it is awesome to know a whole bunch of runners are waiting to group, yet should you not want to NPCs are available.\n\nthe afforementioned LAG is the only issue I have with the game, apart from the desire to see even more kit, weapons and customisation. i cannot lie, Man is it terrible. game stopping often. it results in server shutdowns and mid-mission DCs but the devs work on it constantly so things are being solved.\n\nthings that make it stand out: loyalty to the setting, charming graphics, rewarding gameplay, the collection of clothing to customise your avatar, and the clear effort that the devs put in to giving the community what they want.\n\nthings I want to see: more clothing and tattoos and  hairstyles please! more character thumbnails! more weapons! perhaps weapon modification? solve the lag issues and this would be an incredible little game. obviously the more RP that gets thrown into the mix is better also.","December 13, 2014","true","111.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","4"

Having to restart whole mission because of one misstep is aggravating and makes me just regret my purchase. Some kind of a low power healing would be nice.

So much so that I can finally give it a thumbs up. Character creation has been added and is coming along very nicely. There are more missions and more things to do. No it is not the typical MMO, yes it would be a lot cooler if when running around in the hub you could actually see other players there as well. However, that really won't stop you from enjoying the title. You'll be able to hire other runners, work with other runners, and chat with other runners. A lot of my complaints have been addressed and I can say that this game is coming along nicely. This game could really grow, especially now that the player base is getting more of the game that they hoped for. Now if we could just get more people to go back and redo their reviews as I have.\n\n\n{Edit: Aug. 08} New update brought a lot of good things and really brought my hopes up for this title. Now there is character creation, its limited and mainly just creating your look and weapons, but no skills or anything like that yet. However its a huge step in the right direction. Also they added coop so you can play with a friend, also a big step forward in my opinion.\nNow with all that being said, I still can't really give it a good thumbs up. Its another situation on Steam that I wish they had a middle ground button. Like a "wait and see" button. Fact is, if your wanting to buy a game to play, you can't really play this yet. Not as intended and certainly not as envisioned. You can test out some things. Shadowrun Online is what I would call Pre-alpha. If Alpha is to put together content, and Beta is to iron out bugs and glitches, then this is Pre-Alpha. Its still putting together the basic physics and core aspects of the game. Now if you are a fan or if you just like the concept and want to invest in a game, then yeah I would suggest Shadowrun Online. Just understand its going to be a while before you will get to actually play it.\n\n\nOkay I barely played but what I saw from just 15 mins in was enough. This game is NOTHING that is advertised. I swear the devs added the word Online just to try and sell more copies to the multiplayer crowd, because lets face it, the Shadowrun title is a bit on the underground and nerdy side of gaming so its only going to attract a certain type of player. But add the word "online" to it and you get an entirely different group of player base.\nIf you bought this thinking as I did that this was going to be a Shadowrun MMO as decribed, you will be upset. If you bought this thinking in your head, "Oh this is going to be a Shadowrun/WoW, or TESO, or DC Universe Online", then you will be upset.\nFirst thing, no character creation, no character customization, none of that.\nSecondly it wouldn't matter if they added it because the only missions available are all combat missions, and they are all very straight forward. Do it one way you will succeed, try anything different than what the devs wanted you to do, and exactly how they wanted you to do it, you will fail miserably. The missions that are available are all very short, on very small maps, the difficulty is more in the fact that you can't heal or use any items and yet you have to fight your way through tons of enemies. Its not about it being challenging, cause its not. Basically you play through the first time to learn what the devs wanted you to do, then after you die, you try again doing exactly what your supposed to.\nThird, seeing how the only missions available are combat you would think they would have that part down pat right? No, not at all. Combat is buggy, and has some serious issues. The chance to hit makes some very unrealistic changes, for no reason. Just seems to change after each round if you move or not.\nFourth, you wont be actually playing with or against anyone. You would think with it being Shadowrun "Online", that the basic concept would be to create a character, team up with other runners to pull off bigger and better jobs. But no, thats not it. you just play through combat missions, you don't get to pick a team, you don't get to design a character, you don't get to do much.\n\nSo there you go; no I can not recommend this game, not right now. Maybe later on I'll come back and if things have turned around I'll rewrite this review. But, as it stands today, I wish I hadn't bought it, I especially wish I hadn't spent the 50$ on the top tier. I feel like this is a really big rip off, and is a marketing ploy to raise money. There doesn't seem to be anything "Online" about it, other than the lobby chat on the main screen. And there doesn't seem to be anything "Shadowrun" about it other than it has elves and dwarves with lazers and cyborgs. If you are a Shadowrun fan, unless your die hard about the series and just buy anything with the words "Shadow" and  "Run" on it, I suggest you avoid this.\n\n"Featuring\n•	Gripping and deadly tactical turn-based combat in the Shadowrun world: Choose from a wide array of skills, magic, technology and weapons to survive the challenging missions! Control your team of runners and make every move count! Dive behind cover, outsmart security systems and use any weapon at your disposal to make it out alive.\n• Full character customization: Create your individual Shadowrunner in completely skill based character progression using a variety of outfits, cyberware, abilities and of course a ton of weapons! A successful run requires commanding a team of runners with the right balance of combat, tech, and magical abilities.\n•	Deeply tactical Co-Op and PVP: Team up with friends to face huge variety of deadly enemies or enter PVP combat and develop new strategies to survive in the Shadowrun world.\n•	Directly shape the future of Shadowrun: Developed together with the tabletop RPG writers and based on the Lockdown Campaign setting, Shadowrun Online will allow you to shape the future of the Shadowrun Universe by your actions!"\n\nThat was taken right from the store page, and guess what, they may plan on implementing it someday, but its not anywhere in the game currently. Oh and when they say that the missions are hard they mean pretty much impossible unless you do exactly what we wanted you to do. Otherwise the enemies will pretty much one shot or two shot you.","July 19, 2014","true","49.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","7"

I am going to continue updating this review as the game progresses.\n\nSo got wind of a new update for the game, and decided that, fair being what it is, I'd check it out again.\n\nA lot, and I do mean a LOT, of things have changed for the positive. The combat system is much friendlier now. The graphics are a bit less horrid, there is something like a story, which is good. You have a bit more freedom in choosing your team, although there are still no customization options for them. The available runners also appear to change randomly, forcing you to make choices, and switch up your composition, rather than go with the one thing that works.\n\nSo what all is missing still? Most of the things I complained about in my earlier review are still very much in play, but I feel a glimmer of hope that this may become something very good down the line. I reccomend giving it a look.","October 30, 2014","true","3.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

This ended up in alot of bad review's even tho the developers where working day and nite to fix it.\n\nAfter a couple of patches, and the problem didnt go away, people got really rough in theire review's of this game, and understandably enough, cuz who want's to pay for a game that's essentially not working as intended?\n\nFor those of us who stayed through the troublesome week of mayor lag, we where finally rewarded. Not only did we recieve an offical statement/apoligy from the developers, we also got handsomely rewarded with cyberware ingame, AND not only that.. they actually fixed the lag! - YAY! -\n\nIt seems that now that the lagmonster is finally gone (it was a freaking letter (D) in the code that was missing) they are working on extra content for the game, and so far i can only say that;\n\nI was expecting a more like SNES kinda universe with multiple city's and possible location, but instead i was met by a hub from where all the run's go out from.\n\nI was expecting a matrix sorta like platform where hacking/decking was incorporated like the old SNES version, but instead they integrated deckers on a whole diffrent way. Deckers now have the possibliy to hack into certain items, (oneclick action) and or enemies to either stun, or deal damage to them. Overall this is not what i expected, but nevertheless its not that bad when it comes down to the diffrent kinds of characters you can play within the game. Deckers still have theire unique ability, witch comes handy ingame and no group can survive without one.\n\nGameplay-wise i would say i was kinda dissapointed at first, since i was expecting a more "online" kinda universe, with more interaction between players then just a global chat, and i was further dissapointed when i saw the lack of tradeing possibilies and the lack of hardware/weapons we where able to buy.\n\nAfter doing  a few mission that kinda changed my view. Cuz even tho most of the mission are quite easy, and dosent invovle alot of typing or anything in that matter, it is still a game of choises, and tactics, and a game of makeing the best out of it, even tho people are thinking diffrently from  your own style of play. - Take for instance an easy mission.. one guy on your team, dosent know that there is 20 mobs behind a door, and he opens it, JUST before you thought he would.. Well now you gotta think fast.. And that's what makes the game unpredictable, and fun in the long run..\n\nAnyways, back to the essential thing with this review. Ive spend about 100 hours in the game i would immagine.. most of them with lag and unbearable many restarts and patches, but nevertheless can i totally commit to the chronicle-series and im willing to stay for a longer periode of time, cuz the developers are now looking into adding more content, fixing minor bugs, and adding more possibilies for personal chat and stuff like this.\n\nYou could call this game a gem in disquise. Im sure (with time) that the Cliffhanger Production will make this brand one of the big ones.\n\nImmaging this:\n\nWhat happens after boston? .. New city? .. Could you possibly tranfer your character to the next scenario? .. will the next scenario have further implants? .. better cyberware? .. will the enemies be tougher? .. kinda like a good old fashioned D&D where the levels gets higher and higher? ..\n\nI think its going to be amazing, and i will deff. hang out to see if that's what's intended for this game, cuz if it is.. IM GONNA PLAY EVEN MORE! :D\n\nIm still looking forward to a "true" online version of the old SNES game, but who knows.. its just a matter of time.. in the meantime, this is still the far best (and only) online'ish multiplayer shadowrun/cyberpunk game out there, and its a start..","May 8, 2015","true","44.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Especially some of the player and non player charater models seem to be just some unfinished first alpha version dummys.\n- Not everything is voice overed, there isn't any lip syncing at all\n- The difficulty level is unbalanced. It is 4 times harder to play the missions with NPCs than with your friends. @Devs please make the NPC companions a little bit stronger or more versatile in their skills.

They stuck to it and experienced many sleepless nights trying their best to please the fans and realize their goal.  It seems to finally  be resolved now and I for one hope that anyone who was frustrated at launch will come back and try the game out now.  It is not a sandbox open world MMO, and it is not the most strategicly complex turn based strategy game in the world but it is a very fun version of shadowrun that shows a lot of promise.  I enjoyed it enough that I played even while the issues were ongoing and the lag was nearly unbearable and although it was a bit frustrating I had enough fun to put up with it for hours at a time.  Now that the issue seems to be fixed I will be playing even more and I recommend it to any shadowrun or turn based combat fans!  You can do shadowrun combat missions solo with other characters that you control or with your friends! who hasnt wanted that since they played the first shadowrun console games or even just the original pen and paper?!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/recommended/267750/","genkipro","genkipro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/","2517 products in account","OVERVIEW\nDisclaimer: I am a long-term Shadowrun fan and have played 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Edition P&P Shadowrun, as well as every computer incarnation of the IP that I have ever heard of. I am, without a doubt, a SR 'fanboi'.\n\nSC-BL is NOT what was promised in the Shadowrun Online Kickstarter Campaign. It is also NOT, in my opinion, a role-playing game. And it most definitely does NOT implement any of the official Shadowrun rules. It IS, however, a very fun turn-based strategy game in our beloved Shadowrun universe.\n\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - The graphics in SC-BL are a mixed bag. The effects are nice, the interface graphic icons are consistent and tidy, and the level assets are mostly good, and generally exhibiting a Shadowrun-esque feel. Even the enemy models are pretty good, although without much variation.\n\nHowever, the player models are pretty disappointing, especially given the focus placed by the development team on player customisation. There's only a small number of character profiles to choose from, so you'll see each one multiple times while recruiting henchmen during the campaign, and very few of the plethora of clothing and accessory options actually look very interesting. Hands of the player models are particularly ugly.\n\nSound - Music in the game is good, and most of the sound effects are decent as well. Voiceovers are, for the most part, awful, although the scripts are quite well written and with very few grammar errors.\n\nGameplay - The game is split into two parts: a 'hub' area for dialogue with NPCs, gaining and completing missions, buying and selling gear, and upgrading your character, as well as very limited social interaction with other players online; and the mission / combat part of the game.\n\nThe mission/combat side of the game is where you'll spend most of your time. If you've played any of the XCOM games, Jagged Alliance, Frozen Synapse, or anything like that, then you'll know what to do, but probably be a little disappointed by the limited options. Each mission has you controlling up to four runners, each equipped with two weapons (for human players) or only one (for NPCs). Each turn you can move once and attack or use an ability, or move twice. Abilities are essentially limited to buffs or debuffs, with limited summons available to shamans and riggers. Unfortunately the summons are not as effective as they could (or should) be, as a maximum of two summoned entities can be active at any one time, completely removing any options for all-rigger parties, for example.\n\nI attempted to play multiplayer -- one of the big draw cards of this game when compared to the more traditional Shadowrun RPG games from Harebrained Schemes -- but after spending hours hanging around in the 'lobby' area, posting various 'LFG' messages to chat and inviting others to join in my games, I was unable to join up with even a single other player. This aspect, then, was rather disappointing, although from what I can gather the gameplay is essentially the same, just with a another human PC in place of one of your hired henchmen.\n\n\nPROS AND CONS\nPros:\n+ It's a Shadowrun game, in the Shadowrun game world, with magic, and orks, and dragons, and cyberwear, and guns, and drones, and decking ... oh no, wait: it doesn't really have decking.\n+ Some of the levels are nice and well thought out\n+ Reasonably good balance between most character type makes multi-displinary teams fun\n\n\nCons:\n- Only two summoned units allowed in the party (in singleplayer, at least). WTF!? Why can my rigger only summon her two drones if the shaman hasn't happened to summon her bear spirit? That doesn't make sense!\n- It's not Shadowrun Online. It's not a MMOG. It's not a roleplaying game and doesn't implement Shadowrun rules.\n- Almost everything boils down to just another attack or another way to pick locks; decking is just another weapon that may as well just be a stun gun, hacking is just another % chance to open a door.\n- No real 'end game'.\n- Repeated levels/maps used over and over again through the singleplayer game.\n- Character customisation at first seems quite varied, but everything sort of looks the same, so it's actually not that great.\n- Doesn't cope at all well with network issues -- a few seconds of disconnection and the mission freezes up, requiring a restart, with no way to reconnect to the mission or recover your progress.\n- no decking\n\nCONCLUSION\nI waited a long time to try Shadowrun Chronicles - Boston Lockdown (SC-BL for short). I ummed and ahhed about backing it on Kickstarter when it was still to be Shadowrun Online, and after the first year of updates on Steam and seeing where the game was heading I was very glad that I hadn't outlaid my hard-earned dollars. I had written off the game before even playing it, and that was a mistake.\n\nI wanted to wait until reaching the end of the campaign and at least trying the limited end-game material (two repeatable arena challenges) before writing this review. I also wanted to play multiplayer, but I was unable to find anyone who would accept any of my invites or invite me, so from that aspect at least, it doesn't look good. But there's a fair bit of content in the campaign and I had a lot of fun playing it by myself, regardless.\n\nAm I disappointed? Yes, sure; I really wanted the Shadowrun Online that was promised.\n\nIs this a good game anyway? Yes, definitely!\n\n7/10","February 18","true","36.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I like the game but I don't love it.  The following is from the perspective of playing it solo.  If you intend to play it co-op, I'd easily recommend this game.\n-Can't disable the multiplayer features. Namely, I keep clicking on the chat even though I want nothing to do with the chat.\n-Can't overwatch/guard your characters.\n-Can't save/load. Granted, each map is pretty small but you have to roll with the punches. If things go sideways, you might as well "leave mission" and start over from the area start.\n-I had money, I needed a better weapon, but none were available. For quite a while, the hired runners had better arms and armor than me. It's frustrating being the weakest link and there's nothing you can do about it until the story advances to a point it unlocks more store content.\n-Continuation of above: no options to adjust difficulty. There are some missions that appear to be unbalanced (like this one where I was attacked on two fronts and they were coming faster than I could kill them; finally completed it on my third or fourth attempted).\n-Unlike Harebrained Schemes titles, there's really only one mission I've seen that you can get through without fighting.

But it got a reduction and now it's available for almost nothing in a Humble Bundle. First off, and the reason it has done badly, it's NOT what you would expect from a Shadowrun game after having played the HBS offerings. There is far less depth to story elements, there is no overwatch mechanic and hacking, lockpicking etc is reduced to clicking on your target and a seccess or fail roll. Missions are taken from a single central "market" hub contributing to its not being great in an RPG sense.\nAll this said, it has a lot of positives as well and is certainly enjoyable purely as a TBS more geared towards co-op fun. You can play it fine as a single player game but it quickly becomes clear that this isn't where the main fun lies. My advice is to get it in its Humble package and only grab the DLCs if you find it's to your liking. Overall though it's a perfectly good tbs based in the Shadowrun world and quite unique in that it offers tbs co-op. It's really not the pig Shadowrun fans have made it out to be and despite its faults I'm going to give it a thumbs up overall. As long as you approach it "eyes open" that it's not like the other shadowrun games then you should enjoy it.","March 10","true","9.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It takes the standard Shadowrun series gameplay (SR Returns, DragonFall, Hong Kong etc.) and simplifies it down, then makes it multiplayer. I would really go as far as to say, while being one of the most simple Shadowrun games mechanic wise I feel like the addition of multiplayer and extra character customization with the large amount of player cosmetic options really goes a long way all on its own. Even if you are not really interested in playing cooperatively with other players on your shadowrun team, you can still play through the missions with a team of AI shadow runners of your choice.\n\nTo go into more details about how skills work in Shadowrun chronicles, each weapon type has its own skill "helix" Two separate paths that you make choices from, each level unlocking a skill from either the top or bottom path. There are no "classes" in Chronicles, but your skills are determined by your weapon choices. Each skill set is different, as an example guns are broken down into types, pistol, assault rifle, shotgun etc. while magic, summoning, rigging, and decking are all on separate trees. There are also Paths for Mind/Body that deal with passive abilities that can benefit any weapon choice/ play style.\n\n\nMost player interaction takes place in a hub area in downtown Boston, where in between missions you will meet other shadowrunners, stock up on supplies, sell and buy new gear, pick up side missions or simply change your wardrobe. There is not a whole lot to it other than that, The campaign Boston Lockdown also is centered around the characters you meet here, and as you progress the main plot the hub world changes a little at a time. Story wise I have been entertained well and am enjoying the plot, even if it feels a little shallow and lacks player choice almost completely. There is a strong feeling of mystery around the events that unfold during the main plot and I cant wait to play more.\n\nOverall I recommend Shadowrun Chronicles to any fans looking for another Shadowrun game to play, or to anyone looking for an Isometric RPG they can play Co-op.","January 17","true","36.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sinvey/recommended/267750/","sinvey","Heretic Saint","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sinvey/","296 products in account","Shadowrun Chronicles seems like one of those games you'll either love or quickly lose interest in, depending on your preferences. I wager the 270 hours I have clocked in so far firmly place me in the former camp, though.\n\nSRC is essentially a turn-based squad tactics game with multiplayer support. If you enjoyed combat in XCOM, Jagged Alliance or similar games, you should be able to have fun with this one as well. Unlike these other titles, however, SRC has a stronger RPG factor in that you are "closer" to the Shadowrunner you create, and usually only control this one character, unless you skip on the whole social part that makes this game stand out and play exclusively with NPCs in your team.\n\nCombat itself is easy to learn whilst still challenging the player with tough encounters, some of whom may require multiple attempts. The absence of unlimited healing a la Shadowrun Returns' mages prevents fights from turning into wars of attrition, instead rewarding quick manoeuvers with clever use of cover. Notably, there is no Overwatch/Interrupt due to the developer's reasoning of such actions penalizing movement and melee combat too much. This is a game where (generally) you aren't supposed to hunker down and keep shooting, but instead to try to get close and flank the enemy.\n\nThe level designers' attention to detail deserves a special shout-out, for whilst the environment is not truly destructible, just about any furniture can and will get damaged in a fight. Windows burst, computers get wrecked, vending machines spill their drinks, and fire extinguishers spill white clouds of CO2 as they are damaged, which adds a lot to the immersion as your team kicks some corporate hoop. The visuals as well as the (all-voiced) dialogue truly manage to convey the cyberpunk atmosphere of Shadowrun, evoking the right feelings of this world.\n\nAnother notable and RPG-like feature is the customization, which is setting a new bar for this subgenre. Albeit not quite covering everything you could ask for (stances, different faces and recoloring would be nice to have), the amount of clothes you can combine and wear is massive, easily allowing you to create a truly unique Runner. And you can bet that you will see some truly weird people hanging out in the hub, as dress-up games have become almost a community minigame by now.\n\nUnfortunately, there isn't much going on in terms of roleplaying, as the game does not fully support such activity yet. Social areas like clubs were a feature planned for some time after release, but with the studio being in financial troubles it remains to be seen just when they get around to adding this. Private chat channels as well as private messaging are other features badly needed, but in theory you can at least RP with your team when attempting a mission.\n\nRight now, the only endgame is a rather grindy "challenge" that does not quite manage to capitalize on the game's strengths but at least gives people something to do. Personally, I'd rather recommend rolling up another character, as even multiple campaign playthroughs remain fun thanks to the base mechanics. Though the studio is currently having a tough time staying afloat, they are still working on new content and have recently announced plans for an expansion. Lack of an SRR-style editor is a shame, but no deal breaker.\n\nIn summary, whilst this may not be a perfect Shadowrun game, it absolutely manages to be an enjoyable one. Of note, I also don't believe Shadowrun Returns was a perfect SR game. To me, the perfect Shadowrun game would be something in-between SRC and SRR. But if you enjoyed Returns, give Chronicles a look, too, as I feel it simply approaches this perfection from the other angle.\n\ntl;dr:\n\n+ solid turn-based tactical squad combat, difficult but not unfairly so\n+ incredibly fun in co-op with a friendly playerbase\n+ awesome character customization\n+ nicely catches the dystopian atmosphere of the Shadowrun setting\n\n- desperately needs some Quality-of-Life improvements (private messaging)\n- no level adjustment means endgame runners invited to low level missions will trivialize them\n- sadly no level editor like in Shadowrun Returns","August 10, 2015","true","338.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

For me this is a very fun game to hop on and do a few runs with friends and then hop off again. Its very much a casual game.\n\nIt catches the feel of classic turn based combat very well in my opinion. Yes, it does not have things like overwatch or take cover/hunker down. According to the developers at one point they claimed that was intentional, and in truth any X-Com player knows that overwatch in particular is very easy to exploit so its understandable.\n\nIts important to understand that though this is Shadowrun flavored and certainly catches the spirit of Shadowrun, that it is NOT Shadowrun ruleset. Things like skills and cyberware/essence are handled very differently in this game. Don't let that scare you though as the system they do use will still seam very familiar and it doesn't detract from the title for anyone but the most hardened Shadowrun purists.\n\nTo me the thing that most lets the game down right now is the chat system. Its SUPER basic and lacks things like the ability to PM other players, ignore people, or even just switch it off. The group chat is fairly buggy and overall its something that in a social game I would hope is a priority for them to improve apon. I'd also like to see some kind of queue system for quick joining in runs which would only improve on the "hop in and have a run" feel the game projects.\n\nAnother negative for me is the voice acting. The main characters voice (for females anyways) is HORRIBLE. The accent and the acting. I get that its supposed to be a game set in Boston so credits for trying with the heavy Boston accent but its horrible to listen to on a daily basis especially with a nasally tone to it. Another thing I don't like is the fact that the story voice over takes into no account your skills, so if for example you play a decker you still get voice over of your character moronically not knowing what a grid access point was.\n\nOn a positive note I can't say enough about the character customization in this game. I loath to draw a parallel back to X-com but again it has that kind of depth of customization and honestly even shames many true "MMOs" in its ability to let you get your character looking unique and like you want it. Even this however is a bit let down to me by the limited number of character portraits so though you can make an amazing character sprite, the portrait for it will be cookie cutter and almost never match the character.\n\nStill as a launching point for a future series of modules and gameplay Shadowrun Chronicles is an excellent way to integrate multiplayer and the Shadowrun experience while maintaining a familiar style to the other Shadowun games and good turn based experience. I'd certainly recommend it to people, both fans of Shadowrun and people just looking for a casual, quick fun experience.","April 30, 2015","true","73.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rumblefishgames/recommended/267750/","rumblefishgames","Rumblefish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rumblefishgames/","60 products in account","---1 MAY UPDATE---\n\nNew idea for implementation ...\n- Characters need some sort of rating scheme (like a "level") to make it easier to group with others of equivalent ability. Right now people are advertising themselves in chat as "Decker LFG, 4 Hacking, 3 Automatics". That's way too clunky. Should be able to say something as simple as, "Lvl 4 Decker LFG". Or maybe give characters a Karma rating so they can use it to identify their "level" more easily.\n\n---LAUNCH DAY UPDATE---\n\nI made some changes to my "April Update" below. I'm very much enjoying the game, but as I've been playing some things have come to mind that I would like to see implemented.\n\n---APRIL 2015 UPDATE---\n\nA lot of updates occurred in April. The game is starting to look like a cross between Shadowrun Returns (SRR) and XCOM. Fans of the PNP RPG might be disappointed in the character creation process as it is not a literal translation of those rules. At this time there are no traditional PNP attributes like strength, intelligence, etc. They are reflected instead in broader categories such as Body (which encompasses health, strength, and dexterity), which is labeled as a "skill" along with traditional skills such as Blades, Pistols, Automatics, etc. As you spend karma in a skill set (I'll use Body as an example) you have to make decisions at each purchasing point whether you want to increase your health or dexterity, dexterity or accuracy, health or reaction time, etc. I'm not in love with this method, because I'm one of those who would have preferred to see a literal translation of the PNP rules. However, I understand the realities of creating a game, and I understand that compromises have to be made based on aesthetics and resource limitations. Harebrained Schemes had a significantly larger budget to make every iteration of SRR, and even Jordan Weisman (the creator of the Shadowrun IP) decided to alter their approach in making SRR because the PC game version did not need all the elements of the PNP rules to be a good game. Cliffhanger has taken a similar approach with Shadowrun Chronicles (SRC), and while it might serve as a turn-off to diehard fans of the PNP game, frankly all those differences are forgotten once you start a mission. Once inside, one's only care is completing the run and getting out alive.\n\nA few things I'd like to see that are not (yet?) in the game:\n- Matrix, but I'm sure it's coming. Right now all cyber actions occur in Augmented Reality (AR).\n- More character slots ... three is not enough for the variety of character choices!\n-- As a KS backer, I got an additional 2 upon launch. Or does everyone have 5 now?\n- Rifles (right now they only have pistols, shotguns, and automatics)\n- A larger hub. It's already obvious to me that the hub is going to be very crowded.\n- A place to buy Doc Wagon contracts in the hub! Maybe this appears later in the game, but I see no reason it should not be included from the start.\n- Secondary weapons for NPC runners. They need a go-to when they are out of ammo. Players carry them, so NPCs should have them too.\n- More weapons, cyber gear, and cosmetic items for sale, or at least visible, from vendors\n-- They are in the game, but you can't see them until you progress in "level", then they start showing up at vendors. Still, it would be nice to see the assortment of vendor weapons even if they can't be purchased yet.\n- Unarmed combat (there is no skill tree for it)\n- An item to revive fallen runners during a mission\n- Ability to shoot-move, in that order. At present, standard actions such as attacks end the character's turn, and according to an in-game tooltip, that's intentional so it's unlikely to change. Still, if you can make two actions during a turn, I don't see why choosing to shoot first should deny you the second action.\n- More carrying capacity. Hired Runners have no tactical items, so they can't carry medkits, grenades, etc. That means the only person who can act as a medic is the player, but players can't carry enough medkits to treat everybody. Possible solutions are, 1) give players the ability to equip hired runners with tactical items (that are returned at end of mission if not used), 2) significantly increase player character carrying capacity (ability to carry a minimum of 4 items), or 3) increase the number of times a medkit can be used.\n\n\n---MARCH 2015 REVIEW---\n\nMy complete opinion is still TBD, but for now I'm voting this "up" to balance against the knuckleheads who voted it down because it didn't fit their definition of a MMO.\n\nI backed this project when it first became available on Kickstarter under the name Shadowrun Online. Yes, the devs referred to it as a MMO, but ***if the complainers had actually paused to read the description of the game*** instead of throwing thier money into it because it contained the words "Shadowrun Online" and "MMO", they would have known it was ***always*** marketed as a turn-based co-op game. Seriously, go back to the original Kickstarter announcement and read what it says. At no time did the devs ever mislead anyone about what they wanted to make. So anyone who is disgruntled or disappointed because they didn't get the WoW-like MMO they wanted has no room to complain. But of course, that won't stop them.\n\nAs for the state of the game, it is coming along nicely ... but aside from the fancier graphics I haven't seen anything yet that really makes it stand out from Shadowrun Returns (SRR). I have faith the devs will continue to improve it since this project was for them as much a labor of love as a business venture. But as of March 2015, the only significant difference between Chronicles and Returns is that Chronicles offers community interaction and co-op play which SRR is lacking.","March 21, 2015","true","236.5"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","4"

Shadowrun Chronicles is now complete and handing out the nuyen and contracts like a mad Johnson. I am happy to say that the developers have finally brought this game to state that I can enjoy. Delivering a full game experience. With the ability to create a unique runner, skill sets, and up to 4 player co-op. Now while there is plenty of that has been improved and even fixed. There is still some areas that need a bit of shining. However that doesn't stop this from being a very enjoyable title. Using your crafted runner you will bring something unique to the mission. Rather that be guns, hacking, or maybe a little magic. The story of SRC is not as in-depth as its compatriots. Being mostly linear and devoid of RPG elements. The graphics are good enough, as is the aesthetic of cyberpunk. Although the zoom features lets you see the block like shapes of the characters. In all SRC is a game that Shadowrun fans can enjoy and includes a pivotal element that other Shadowrun games missed. Multiplayer. For this reason and more.

(strangely, i always think a chonicles was a kind of long story...)\n\nsecond thing: yes,  i've only play 2 hours. Guess why? c'mon, try it, it's fun!\nno? no one guess? even you, in the last row?\nit was bacause each time i try to play to this game, the server got down. It's not even a joke, i try to play, BAM, "update" i wait and connect myself 1 hour after....lag...more lag...server down....\nI don't want to be a crybaby, but i've buy this game in the state of mind to play with, not just stare at the title in my steam library (what i do, finally, pretty sad huh?)\n\nthird: the character creation: so let see:\nchoose a metahuman race: check! noteable difference betwenn? nope.\nrp backstory: yup. two line, three maximum. never use after that in the game, for what i could see.\nclothing: yay, "lot" of choice. impact on the game: nope.\nweapon: yup, one of each for the beginning.\n(then you been throw in the hub after a tutorial mission with the less creative thing i've seen in a videogame: you wake up, confusing, without any idea of where you are.....i mean, c'mon guys, the "oblivious" character background was so used, and missused, and re-used again....it's even not a good starting point for a scenario (and, after playing pen and paper rpg, it's the most common trick made by lazy people writing,  playing or mastering games!!!)\n\ndid i miss something? oh, yes, my favorite part: tactical ! i've brievly write above the overwatch, but it's not the worse.\nthe worse is when you realize whatever you do, or don't do, the enemy will come point blank, for the most part when you pinned down by a sentry turret. And, for some, like the bargesth, they cause fear, meaning you will go running out of your cover. Of course, you could shoot those mob before and...in fact no, you can't, because they're pop out of blue!\n\nfor the end, the multiplayer aspect of the game: i've not try it, first of all because of the connectivity wich i mentionned before, and, actually, that don't really interest me much. I like to play solo, for discovering the story ....oh, wait, the game haven't one...maybe i will try, one day then...\n\nin short: if you like Shadowrun, do you favor: don't spend your money in this game. not now. maybe when the game was in full release, but now it's more an pre-release alpha, after the alpha and beta, if you see my point.\nTry, if you want a good story, Shadowrun returns and/or Dragonfall director's cut.

I have since encountered different issues, such as the weapon vendor having a blank screen no matter how many times I restart so that I can no longer progress my character's weapons. Now that I've gotten a chance to play the game I'm disappointed that the only benefit I get from being a hacker, or a lockpicker is the chance to get an extra pair of pants or a skimpy bikini. I started a couple of other characters as well, but there is very little variation between the them. Hackers are essentially crappy ranged attackers with a couple of stun abilities. Gameplay is still very much like other negative reviewers have described it, you'll fall asleep if you don't have a friend goading you into playing and keeping it lively. The best Shadowrun game is still on a cardtridge or a piece of paper, and maybe if gamers stop defending every piece of ♥♥♥♥ cashgrab that caters to their interests you'll get a quality game someday.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis is the current experience.\n\n*TRY* to log into or create a character, this might cause the connection to hang requiring any number of restarts. Some of your characters might be lost to you for hours on end.\n\nConnect to your friend, sometimes spending hours wondering why your friend in the same room can't find your instance or mission lobby. When the server manages to find someone, it will still take forever while the connection hangs. During any of the loading processes, you may have to shut down the character and repeat the hellish login process.\n\nOnce you're in a mission, expect 2-60 seconds to have every single action recognized and processed by the server.

( only have about 17hrs at the time of writing this but EVERYONE I have run into in game has been nice and helpful. Alot even rollplay in chat during games, which adds to the environment).\n- Shadowrun co-op\n\nCons:\n- Its all about the combat (nothing else really takes place in this game, no side hacking like in other shadowrun titles. No talking your way out of situations like in the Hairbrain games, every mission is kick drek and take names. Possible a Pro for some people but I have noticed alot of complaining in forums about its lack of deversity).\n- map variety (although as stated the map are amazing, having not completed the campaign I am already seeing repeated maps in storymode).\n- Chat system is lacking (for a multiplayer game that requires grouping you can't whisper/tell people or even those on your friend list!)\n- Singleplayer lacking (you have the ability to play the story singleplayer and multiplayer but the companions for singleplayer are lacking compared to other players making it difficult to solo and forcing people to play multiplayer).\n\nOverall it doesn't follow Shadowrun PnP to much and it isn't one of the Hairbraine games so I think alot of people got down on it. However it is a great multiplayer x-com style co-op game that I am now sure I will be getting my return on in fun.","August 31, 2015","true","18.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Note: this review is mostly relevant for the campaign. I haven't touched the end-game content yet.\n\nCurrently the game works best in Single Player. Most of the current player-base have end-game level characters, so playing pick-up Co-Op will make the missions way too easy. If you are playing with a friend of similar level, then Co-Op would be fantastic, but I haven't been able to try that.\n\nThe game plays like a simplified version of Shadowrun Returns, with elements of X-Com. Its not much of an RPG (no exploration, no branching dialog) but you do control one character through the campaign and can choose a progression and item selection. If you play alone, you bring along 3 other NPCs with you on missions. They level up automatically and it doesn't matter if they die.\n\nThis game is good if you like Shadowrun, and want something to play after having beaten all of HBS games.

For what it is, it's a good game.  Now, I'd like to preface that with the statement that I've been following this game since it was announced some years ago, back when it was still called Shadowrun Online, when all the game really had to offer were a handful of unpolished missions and character options.  That said, it has come leaps and bounds in what can honestly be called a particularly ambitious project for a small studio like Cliffhanger, and you know what, I think they did a pretty good job all things considered.\n\nAdmittedly, they have had some stumbling blocks, from early launch lag issues to missing or broken items and even in some cases surprise gamebreaking bugs, but through all that their Dev team was very responsive to the community's questions and concerns and tried to maintain as much transparency as they could concerning their efforts to fix said issues.  Even after the fact, they tried to make reparations to to the community as a whole as an apology for the trouble, which, in my opinion, speaks very highly of Cliffhanger as a whole.\n\nThat said, and onto the game itself, its a hex grid, turn based isometric centered in the Shadowrun universe following the adventures of your shadowrunner through (for the sake of being spoiler-free) the events of what could be called the Boston Incident.\n\nThe story itself is creative and unique, and well written besides, with tolerable voice acting where it applies (though the Boston accent can get tiresome during subsequent playthroughs) and does stay loyal to the Shadowrun source material.  That said, and I can't emphasize this enough, the game is not a point-for-point match to the PnP source.  Certain liberties have been taken in regards to the game being both online and, well, being a game.  Certain facets in the PnP source are unfortunately absent, in as far as customization goes, and as of right now most missions center around a run-and-gun playstyle (meaning that no, there isn't a stealth option).  That said, what it delivers, it delivers very well in that the combat is well-polished, balanced, and fun, and the downtime inbetween missions does offer a lot of chance for backstory, worldbuilding, and customization.\n\nBear in mind, what I said about the game lacking certain aspects of customization doesn't mean that the game lacks in customization at all.  In fact, it offers a wide array of options, both practical and cosmetic, both at creation and that which can be earned through gameplay.  This includes items that can be used in missions, weapons, armor, various types of cybernetics and spells, and a wide array of skills and abilities.  It opens up a lot of tactical options and allows players to approach objectives from several angles, which, in some cases, is absolutely vital towards the success of any given mission.\n\nDifficulty can vary from build to build, and while there's no expressly "right" way to play, there is a certain limitation to the number of playstyles you can use.  That said, there are a lot of variations, so the limits to what you can do are pretty broadly defined.\n\nThe interface is fine for the format.  There aren't any outstanding bugs or issues at this iteration of the game and for the most part, it's very intuitive and easy to master.  Gameplay is in tradition turn-based format, and despite the game being online, it can be played in both single and multiplayer, both of which offer their own share of advantages and disadvantages.  That said, while the game is beatable in purely solo play, it is *significantly* harder to finish the content.  Harder, but not impossible.\n\nUltimately it delivers what it promised.  I bought the delux edition when it came out and you know what?  As far as games go, I got my money's worth.  It had it's ups and downs, and while I really don't think the Early Access reviews give the game a fair shake at what it is now, compared to what it was, they do have offer a good look into what the game was like during developement.  Is it worth 30$?  I think so.  I go my money's worth, which is a lot more than I can say for a lot of AAA titles in the last few years.  Better for it that you don't really need a background in the Shadowrun universe in order to enjoy the content for what it is.\n\nSo for me at least, I give the game a solid 4 out of 5 and with it my recommendation.","August 19, 2015","true","73.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

It's part of the Shadowrun series, but doesn't really seem to fit in with the other games that where mad ein thsi series. It has it's good and bad points, one of the main points being the new 4 multiplayer co-op mode that adds a bit more depth to the game itself from the other games in the series.\n\nGameplayShadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown starts with a really nice character design screen. ou are able to design your character, it has a large variety of tools that you can use to make your character unique and what you want yiur character to look like. Unfortuantly, this customization isn't carried over to the AI that are with you, letting the game down a little bit, but not by all that much. It would've been nice to be able to fully be able to customize your entire team, but it's not possible in this game. The missions do start off rather well, you might get a feeling that you are playing in XCOM, but with a cyberpunk feel and many different characters. Although to start off with the missions seem to be nice and flexible, it does start to get that feeling of just being the same mission, but with a different location that you are in and different enemies that you have to kill. The weapons that you can equip on your character seem to be all nice, and they all seem to be different from one anther. But in actual fact all the weapons that you find aren't really all that great, you don't really get that satifaction when you find a weapon in this game. I would say that playing co-op with some friends on this game would definatley be recommened, just because your friends will probably bring along useful items and equipment rather than the AI. It also makes it run a lot faster than having to play single player with the AI running with you as well.\n\nThe graphics of the game are great, and what really helps the game pull itself back up from some of the negative things that I have listed above. The graphics of each area that you go into seem different from the last and gives you a new change of scenery throughout the game. The lighting and shadowing isn't really focused upon that much throught the game, but some points here and there did stand out to be rather nice looking and such.\n\nPros+ Fun Cooperative play\n+ Great character customization\n+ Nice Graphics\n+ Trading Cards & Achievements\n\nCons- Samey sort of missions\n- Not fully customizable squad\n\nResult / Final thoughtsShadowrun Chronicles - Boston Lockdown is a fairly fun and enjoyable game. I would recommend playing it in short bursts of say 30 minutes - 1 hour, as you may get bored of the samey missions and not come back to the game. The graphics are well designed and the character customization is well done.\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Sometimes You Playing curator group here.","March 24","true","2.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Playable with friends.\n\nI'm a fan of the Shadowrun setting and I liked Shadowrun Returns, so I thought this game should be fun as well with the ability to play co-op as well. Well, I was partly right, because it is pretty decent as long as you have someone to play with. The reasons I'm not recommending the game is:\n- I'm a fair bit into the story, but shops never sell anything new so it feels like I'm just accumulating nuyen (money).\n- Skill trees feel very bland and at higher levels you need tons of karma (xp) to advance in a seemingly pointless skill.\n- Magic is done wrong. A pure mage can't really harm robots in this game, while in the game system there are plenty of spells to do so with. Also, troll mages seem to be the best choice, because they do more magic damage. No clue why.\n- Speaking of magic, hit% is really weird. Often I can have a 90% chance to hit with an AoE-spell and still miss, and every time I miss the spell hits one or more friends instead. Like, why would I throw a manaball backwards just because I missed the particular tile I was aiming at? This is almost game-breaking at times.\n- The further you progress, the more you realize that the developers were lazy and just reused the same levels over and over again. The only things that change are where and which mobs are placed.\n- Story isn't really engaging, so far it's mostly been "meh".\n\nThis being said, if you'd really like some (simple) turn-based shadowrun action together with a friend or two, go ahead. I'd recommend you to first look up some gameplay-videos on YouTube though and get the game on a sale.","May 20","false","22.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

The trouble is that everyone you will play with will be max level and trying to farm more skillpoints. Then when the story does end you're left to do the same. There is no true decking subgame. There are no custom missions or procedurally generated content, so the maps can get old pretty quick after you finish the story.

I wasn't really convinced at first, but when we started playing, it was actually great fun. We were usually playing together, so I can't tell how easy it is to build a group without knowing players IRL. But with a group leveling up together, it's a neat teamplay experience. Also, it's a game you can play together with your nongamer girlfriend, since you don't have to be a APM genius to play this game, as it's turnbased, and still face a decent challenge.\n\nPositive:\n*) Interesting Skill System\n*) Diverse Teams pay off, covering each others weaknesses\n*) Quick Gameplay, one mission usually takes only 20 minutes or something.\n*) Challenging Gameplay: After the first few Intro missions, you quickly discover that charging in just gets you killed. The game rewards a commando-like gameplay, which I liked.\n*) Interesting plot. The scale might be a little TOO grand, but maybe that's just me.\n*) Very interesting characters. I really liked the dialogues, and I also have to really praise the voice actors at this point.\n*) Going through the campaign once with my friends took me about 30 hrs, although we played a few missions twice when someone had to catch up. I think that's alright for a game that costs 20 bucks.\n\nNegative:\n*) The last few missions were too easy. You got a lot of fancy new skills and equipment, while the enemies didn't get stronger by an appropiate amount. (Thankfully, at least the very last mission was pretty hard again, and a good temporary end for the campaign.)\n*) The Chat Window is really weird. If you close it, you can't chat with your teammates (and you can't open it with ENTER, just with the mouse). If you leave it open, it stops you from clicking on a considerable part of the screen.\n*) If you happen to change to a different skill right as one of your teammates does something, the active skill will reset back. Which, when you don't notice it, is extremely annoying and often dangerous. (e.g. you're on a melee skill and wanted to switch to a ranged one, fail to notice it resetting back to melee, and suddenly you charge into a group of enemies.)\n\nGenerally, I learned to live with the above problems. Sometimes they even made for some very fun moments you could laugh about afterwards. Still think they could improve that, though.\n\nTLDR:\nSurprisingly fun game. Playing it with your friends is awesome. It's a bit like a good action movie.","October 24, 2015","true","37.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"

The people complaining it's not strategic enough either have not played very far, or want it to be an exact clone of X-Com.  Although there's no overwatch button that you're forced to press about 1000 times per mission, it has it's own mechanics that make it interesting.  The game's storyline is not going to win any awards, but by the end I did want to know what would happen.  You can also click past all the dialogue if you choose to.\n\nShadowrun fans will be surprised to learn that Decking now does damage in the meat space.  However, after some thought, this makes sense both for gameplay and for lore purposes.  Throughout the game, the story seems to assume that datajacks now wireless and that every metahuman has one, two assumptions that would have been far-fetched in 1980s, but are obvious to today's cell phone culture.  Since wireless networks are inherently capable of peer-to-peer connections, I think it's actually logical that IC damage could happen even without connecting to the (server-based) matrix.  Of course, from a gameplay perspective, standing around while the team's decker entered the matrix would be pretty boring, so the changes are also necessary to make Shadowrun multiplayer.\n\nFor those who prefer single player experience: My Rifle/Decker character was able to complete the entire main story and all side missions with no grouping; only the post-game challenge mission requires grouping.  Some missions were a little tough, so there are probably some character builds that would require grouping for the main game.\n\nFor first time players: You will have enough experience points, money, and weapon slots to choose two of the main damage ability trees: Shotguns, Handguns, Automatics, Blades, Blunt, Spellcasting, Summoning, Decking (Hacking), or Rigging (using robotic drones).  For those learning the game, I recommend you choose Automatics or Shotguns for one of your two skills, and whatever you want for the second.  You could also pair Hacking with Spellcasting or Summoning, or Rigging with Spellcasting.  Don't pick both melee skills, both magic skills, or both minion skills (Rigging and Summoning), at least until you know what you're doing.","July 4, 2015","true","103.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Though I've played enough to point some flaws and some positive points from the game, so let's start.\n\nPositives:\n\n++ A new skill system which works very well, all classes are very fun to play and pretty strong on their own ways. Surely riggers is a pretty cheap build to exploit and also pistols seems to be a little too good in comparison to the rest, but since this system is totally new, I've to say, it's pretty good.\n\n++ The combat is fun to play, but the same thing, would happen if the consumer buys another shadowruns title, or a similar game from this genre, such wasteland 2, age of wonder 3, xcom, fallen enchantress, endless legends, divinity of original sin, and so on. So, while I do enjoy the combat system, this isn't anything revolutionary, which could be found on another titles, with way less issues, more real content and better price tag offer.\n\n+ Customization, is both good and bad.\nIt's good because it's a new feature, and welcoming one, still some clothes should've a better texture and polishement.\n\nNegatives:\n\n--- Lag, some times it spikes from 3 seconds to 15 seconds, from some one who owns a 10mb internet, it's pretty to much. Also, the player may face disconnect on middle of the match, or keep getting a friend disconnected. Yesterday I was playing with a friend, and he got DC 6 times in less than 3 hours, also I just got a DC from a single player game that I was doing, I was very close to finish the match, and since I'm doing SP since the beginning, isn't as easier than co-op, there's no excuse for that.\n\n-- The player cannot remove a cyberware part. While some people may argue that this wasn't allowed on shadowruns universe, let me just resume that this game was been made by a different team, different developer, and more than half of things on this game aren't exactly the same from other titles, so there's no point of remove this, to keep a "balance" when the system is completely new.\n\nLet me tell you what's gonna happen, if you're a new player and found a cyberware piece for 1 essence cost, and just decided that I'll buy them all, because you have 6 essence and it only cost 4, the next improved version will cost 2 each, which means, even if you replace the obsolete version, you'll be unable to upgrade 3 slots and will be forced to stick with 1 useless slot, and another weaker version of something. In resume, you would need 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 essence, but if you buy 4 cyberwares you'll have 2 + 2 + 1 + 1, so 2 slots with junk. There's no wiki, there's no warning, there's NOTHING to tell which items the player will receive and can properly plan ahead, in other words, either you start again from the scract or keep playing with a weaker build.\n\n-- Summon limitation. Do you remember how cool it was to choose one rigger/decker, one shaman/socerer, one soldier and another melee or a similar kind of combination, from the older titles?\nOn this one, you can have a maximum of two pets, if a rigger summon 2 drones, means that your shaman cannot summon an spirit (main focues of his tree) or if a shaman summon his spirit the rigger would not be allowed to summon all of his drones (mainly focus on his tree.)\n\nBasically, the devs said: "We've made a very strong unbalanced build, so you're not allowed to play with it, we don't care about how much you want to play with your class abilities, we'll not propely balance it, you'll just not play with it, face it."\n\n-- If you've played shadowruns returns or dragonfall, you'll notice the amount of text lines, and how well detailed always have been. Here everything it's superficial, and most character are extremely annoying with complety redundant texts or lack of. The overall plot however, seems to be ok, ins't a master piece, but isn't lame as above.\n\n- Limit of character creation. Do you ever wanted to try all possible combinations and classes? Happens it's not possible, the consumer is allowed to build up to characters and no more than that.\n\n- No respec system. What makes it even worse is the fact, a good amount of skills has a terrible description, which means if the player chooses a wrong skill, either he'll stick into it, or restart the game from the very beginning. So it definitely punishes the player for trying and discovering, and for playing, since some skills doesn't gave a proper description for this kind of set rules.\n\n- There's no category on hair type and colour, which means instead of choosing 1 hair and then go to another, you'll have to pass from all colours until reach the next type. This is extremely time consuming, and there's only two possible reasons to:\n1 - Lazy team.\n2 - They wanted to give a fake impression of quantity, to deceive people from noticing that there isn't that many amount of hairs types. (Yes, the player is abled to choose a hair type, once the character is created, but why there's no such option for the character creation screen?)\n\n- There's no sound track on character creation, and the noise is way too loud when you keep changing things.\nIt's extremely annoying. I've turned my sound off, while I was finishing my character creation.\n\n- Bugs. Some skills doesn't worth as description says, some times people are unable to buy things from vendors, sometimes people can't organizate matchs with his friends, some times people can't login into the game.\n\nIn sume, if you haven't played any shadowruns title before, don't think twice and go purchase dragonfall right now!\nIf you've played shadowruns returns and dragonfalls, and is wanting something new... I would advice you to look for something else instead... This game ins't even close to the predecessor titles quality, it's still good, but not as.\nThey're a different developer team, same than jagged alliance, which some of you guys may be familiarized.\n\nWait 60 - 80% price drop, or move around, that's my suggestion.","April 30, 2015","false","49.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

Since then I became a huge fan of the series and played all released PC games so far, including Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown.\n\nI especially fall for the title made by Cliffhanger Productions due to its online/multiplayer feature. It is a really great experience so far and I must admit that I got addicted a bit recently.\n\nLet me summarize Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown:\nIt's a classic turn-based strategy (TBS) game like XCOM (as often mentioned), Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate or the rebooted Shadowrun game series made by Harebrained Schemes and unifies the best aspects of all mentioned TBS games. Its simple controls and game basics on one hand and its partly very challenging combats and missions on the other hand are in sum appealing to both, 'old hands' and rookies. A bonus are the RPG elements and the skills system, which are similar to Harebrained Schemes' Shadowrun games, but slightly rearranged. Right now, there are already wide possibilities of skills and skill combinations, e.g. decker, rigger, shotguns, blades, blunt, shaman etc.\n\nThe game mechanics are based on the fifth edition of the Shadowruns tabletop game and its very potent licence, meaning if you're into cyberpunk, science fiction, dystopia and love the Shadowrun universe, this game is for you.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some drawbacks as well. Even though there are relatively much missions to play, lot of them are short or seem kinda inconsistent story wise. In general lacks the story in excitement and depth and gains momentum only late in the story progress. Therefor, some side missions are really interesting and challenging and a lot of fun (but are taking place on recurring maps of the main campaign though).\nThe missions are more fun in cooperative multiplayer with fellow 'Chummers', but sadly it can take quite a while before you get fellow players together since the game is a little depopulated currently. In other words, you are depending on prebuilt henchmen sometimes, whose character development you cannot affect or control. Thus, they are a little 'underpowered' but should be enough powerful for the main story campaign.\nThe interaction with other players is also kinda awkward, since there is no direct chat (whispering) implemented and basically there are only two chatrooms in total existing; the global chat and the party chat if you teamed up with other players. This can be a bit annoying sometimes but is still to handle.\n\nGood thing is the developers still add content to the game and have much plans for the future. The support by the game developers, Cliffhanger Productions, is outstanding; very curteous and extremely kindly (and fast!).\n\nThat's why I rate this game positive. Again: if you're into Shadowrun, TBS and Fantasy, support the devs and that hidden gem and buy it!\n\nMy judging:\n\n4.5/5","December 18, 2015","true","253.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

That being said, while Cliffhangar has worked their asses off and spent many sleepless nights slaving away, having the same expectations for SRC that you have for SRR is going to disappoint you.\n\nDoes that mean SRC sucks? Not at all. I quite enjoy it, and I invite you to see my profile for the hours I've put into this and the Returns series. If you are a big fan of the Shadowrun lore and universe, I'd be surprised if you didn't like this one.\n\nThis game does require a perpetual Internet connection, even if you're playing with NPC henchmen. The online aspect of this game is amazing and really helps prevent the "ho hum doing this kind of mission again" burn-out you might feel. We have quite a few character slots so you're free to explore different characters. The cosmetic options are pretty flexible and certainly helps capture the eclectic look of shadowrunners.\n\nUnlike SRR this game has voice-acting, although some people cringe at it's B-movie quality. Still though there were a few VA's I enjoyed. However your runner in this game is pretty static. You don't really have control over your personality or dialogue, so you won't feel the same you did in the SRR series.\n\nAs for the combat, it uses a some-what simpler form of X-Com: EU and SRR. There's still cover (just half and full in this case), but combat itself is very brutal in this game. It's not uncommon for an average runner to only have between 15-23 hp. In fact, end-game runners might just barely clear 40 hp. So if you or an enemy make a mistake, you might very well die from it.\n\nSpeaking of death, there's really no penalty. If your henchmen dies, oh well. They'll be there next mission, good as new. If a fellow player dies, a timer starts counting down (representing them bleeding to death). If you can't finish the mission in time, you automatically fail. If you do fail a mission, just brush yourself down and try again.\n\nUnfortunately, at this time there is no matrix. You have a few times you visit a node to chat with campaign Chummers, but no actual Matrix involved in runs. I'm sure down the line they will implement a more proper form, but for now you're stuck in meat-space.\n\nSo what the Hell does a decker actually do in SRC then? They use their deck to shoot a dial-up laser of death, which deals a type of damage most enemies are vulnerable to. It also ignores cover and line-of-sight issues. Decking skills can stun or mark enemies, making them easier to hit.\n\nAt this time the respec option hasn't been completed, so you are stuck with the choices you make for your runner. However the flexibility of your character is still there. You can spec into just about any role you want. Want to be a glass-cannon critting machine? Go for it. Want to hang back and use drones and/or spirits to wade into the fray? Go for it. Want to throw caution into the wind and go melee? Up to you.","June 29, 2015","true","203.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

That being said, while Cliffhangar has worked their asses off and spent many sleepless nights slaving away, having the same expectations for SRC that you have for SRR is going to disappoint you.\n\nDoes that mean SRC sucks? Not at all. I quite enjoy it, and I invite you to see my profile for the hours I've put into this and the Returns series. If you are a big fan of the Shadowrun lore and universe, I'd be surprised if you didn't like this one.\n\nThis game does require a perpetual Internet connection, even if you're playing with NPC henchmen. The online aspect of this game is amazing and really helps prevent the "ho hum doing this kind of mission again" burn-out you might feel. We have quite a few character slots so you're free to explore different characters. The cosmetic options are pretty flexible and certainly helps capture the eclectic look of shadowrunners.\n\nUnlike SRR this game has voice-acting, although some people cringe at it's B-movie quality. Still though there were a few VA's I enjoyed. However your runner in this game is pretty static. You don't really have control over your personality or dialogue, so you won't feel the same you did in the SRR series.\n\nAs for the combat, it uses a some-what simpler form of X-Com: EU and SRR. There's still cover (just half and full in this case), but combat itself is very brutal in this game. It's not uncommon for an average runner to only have between 15-23 hp. In fact, end-game runners might just barely clear 40 hp. So if you or an enemy make a mistake, you might very well die from it.\n\nSpeaking of death, there's really no penalty. If your henchmen dies, oh well. They'll be there next mission, good as new. If a fellow player dies, a timer starts counting down (representing them bleeding to death). If you can't finish the mission in time, you automatically fail. If you do fail a mission, just brush yourself down and try again.\n\nUnfortunately, at this time there is no matrix. You have a few times you visit a node to chat with campaign Chummers, but no actual Matrix involved in runs. I'm sure down the line they will implement a more proper form, but for now you're stuck in meat-space.\n\nSo what the Hell does a decker actually do in SRC then? They use their deck to shoot a dial-up laser of death, which deals a type of damage most enemies are vulnerable to. It also ignores cover and line-of-sight issues. Decking skills can stun or mark enemies, making them easier to hit.\n\nAt this time the respec option hasn't been completed, so you are stuck with the choices you make for your runner. However the flexibility of your character is still there. You can spec into just about any role you want. Want to be a glass-cannon critting machine? Go for it. Want to hang back and use drones and/or spirits to wade into the fray? Go for it. Want to throw caution into the wind and go melee? Up to you.","June 29, 2015","true","203.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Sorry.\n\nWhat I liked\n- Co-op is implemented finally. I never expected it to become a full blown MMORPG. I actually like the online mechanics which are similar to the first guildwars (never played gw2, no clue if it works the same there). Good move to remove "Online" from the title, maybe a bit late ;). I yet have to discover the persitence apsect of the world though. Didn't jump right into my face from the first hours of playing.\n\n- Localization is on a good way, there are even localized voiceovers! You would not expect that from an indi game, some tripple-a titles even fail to deliver here.\n\nWhat I did not like\n- The original Shadowrun game is a roleplaying game with turn based fights as one aspect. Shadowrun Croncicles reduces the whole Shadowrun experience to the round based tactic part of it. "Shadowrun Returns" did a way better job transpoting the SR story/rpg elements to the player by implementing dialog decissions and dialog options based on skills. ShadowRun Chronicles is like what Final Fantasy Tactics was for the Final Fantasy franchise. IMHO it doesn't do the IP justice (although I must admit there have been way worse adoptions in the past *cough* microsoft *cough*). Yes, I AM a demanding customer :P\n\n- If a GM on a p&p session would have tossed the amounts of enemies at us like the game does - especially when you are low on level and skills and just started - we would have punched him in the face. From the three runs I did, I didn't manage to finish one without repeating it multiple times and still loosing at least one party member in the end. It often comes down to doing a run at least twice so you know what you got to expect and can manage better / do a better choice on the sidekick you take with you. Not my cup of tea.\n\nSo while there are some positive aspects - for me the negative ones weight heavier. Overall I'd rahter have skipped buying that game. But since I did and the money is already spent I'll keep having an eye on the game and maybe even the thumb will point up one day if the game emerges from a SR rules based tactics simulator towards an SR roleplaying game.","November 22, 2014","false","4.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

In Boston Lockdown, you take the roll of a shadowrunner who wakes up on a metal slab.  How did you get there?  Why did a dragon destroy the Red Sox playoff hopes?  Take the roll of any kind of shadowrunner you want, hit the matrix, shoot straight, and never, ever, deal with a dragon.\nMechanics- There isn't much here in the game, but it works decently. Players get to choose a race and select how they want to build their character.  But, there isn't a whole lot there.  The races give a bit of a difference at character start, but don't really change the game all that much.  You get a couple of powers that you will use through your archetype all the way through the game.  You increase the powers by training up a simple skill tree.  That's fine, but you don't really get a ton of depth from that.  Once you have your powers, that's in!  Don't expect a ton of difference between a start character and a character that finishes the game.  You're numbers a bigger, but that's really it.  In terms of game play, the game is a simple tactical game.  You're team of characters takes their turn moving and shooting/using powers, then the bad guys go.  That is every single mission.  You might get a mission to defend a location for a bit or touch X number of switches on the map, but overall it's the same mission over and over again.  Again, not bad, but you won't spend 10 hours playing this game.  It's fun for a short burst, but then you'll put it down and do something else.  It's a semi-solid B effort. 4/5\n\nTheme- Here is the saving grace of the game-This is Shadowrun 2075!  You're playing modern Shadowrun set in the same universe as all the current books.  Wiz!  If you want to see how the world story is changing, then you're going to play this game.  The story is fun and fresh.  It does have the standard "milk run to major plot" cliché we know and love, but it does get its foot in the door.  4.5/5\n\nExecution- If the theme is good, and the mechanics are ok, then the execution is the bad.  This game is lag-tastic.  I have a laptop and a desktop that can both run some pretty hardcore, taxing games, but this game lags on both.  There aren't even that many people on screen, and the game lags.  Forgiving lag, the game feels kind of half done.  It's a working finished product, but some characters get a voice, and some don't.  Why?  Stick to all voice or all text, as it feels like the budget run out halfway through this part.  The controls are semi-intuitive, so that's ok, but the learning curve can cost you some money in the beginning.  The fact you only really get two powers for the whole game doesn't really make me think leveling up the character is important.  It's not a horrible game by any means; it just feels like it's not completely finished.  3.5/5\n\nSummary-There are two major Shadowrun computer games coming out now: the online game and Shadowrun Returns.  This is where it gets hard.  Shadowrun Chronicles isn't a bad game, but compared to Shadowrun Returns, it's not the best.  Honestly both games tend to get a little same-y as every level is a tactical encounter with little roleplaying, but Returns beats Chronicles on that front.  What Chronicles has that Returns doesn't is the current world/metastory and co-op.  That's what has its hooks in me.  I'm a sucker for a shared world I can influence, and this one has it in spades.  So the honest summary-if you only have $25 to spend and need a great introduction to Shadowrun-buy the RPG ebook (Didn't see that one coming did you?!).  However if you need a video game, then you should hands down get Dragonfall and Shadowrun Returns.  If you want an online experience with leveling and co-op with friends with some current Shadowrun story, then Shadowrun Chronicles is a good place to play.  Neither beat the tabletop experience, but Chronicles will at least let you game with some friends.   80%\n","May 12, 2015","true","8.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's turn-based strategic shooting in the same vein as Fallout Tactics or Xcom, though with less focus on the story aspect.\n\nThe game has its faults, chief among them the chat system which at this time offers no way to communicate privately with other players, as well as frequent disconnections from the servers which ejects you from the game entirely. However despite this, the enjoyment factor is extremely high and the game is never more fun than when you have four players in the same experience range taking on a mission together.\n\nThe co-op element, whether you are two players with a NPC each or a full team of four, really makes me happy with this purchase. And as it stands, this is my favourite co-op game of the year (and in several years). If assembling groups was a bit easier, the communication more streamlined and the characters a little more customizable, it would a must-own title.\n\nAs-is, I would recommend to to anyone who likes tactical co-op or shadowrun/sci-fi.\nFor anyone else it might be a gamble.","December 29, 2015","true","97.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A more detailed review to come after I have had a chance to put more time into the game.  For now I have changed the recommendation from no to yes, as I am having fun playing the game right now, and Steam doesn't offer any third option yet.\n\n\n\nThe game is fun but flawed. It is a turned-based co-op game with parties between 2-4 characters with an addition 2 summoning slots for drones and spirits. You can fill out the party slots by hiring henchmen that you will control, by finding other people to join you on a mission, or a combination of both.  My experiences with the community have been great, always willing to answer questions I have and I have not had any problems finding people to join me on missions.  Most of flaws in the game come mostly from the game feeling rushed out of Early Access with parts of the game feeling incomplete or unfinished.   One big plus for the game is the Dev's are still working on the game and have been active in the community and seem to be listing to suggestions,\n\nMy main problems with the game right now.\n\n1. No whisper or private chat in game. There is no way to talk privately to your friends or just to discuss anything with community members.  So have fun filling the global chat with anything you want to talk about. I shouldn't say no way, you can invite them to your group to chat, but that is only if you are not already in a mission and your group isn't full.\n\n2. A lack of information in the game. There is a lot of stuff in the game that is never explained to you in game, and a lack of documentation makes some things very frustrating.  Some examples of this are in the perks you choose. Some will clearly start you will receive a 10% increase to damage or critical hits, where as others will only tell you that you will receive a boost to damage or crit, but never how much of a bonus.\n\n3. No looking for group tool or chat. There is no way to find a group to join, or find members for your mission except to keep calling out in the global chat.\n\n4. PVP focus of the game has Cliffhanger making poor design choices.  This game is focused on PVP, which is not even in the game yet, and because of that they have made a number of poor design choices too keep parity in the classes, rather than focus on a good co-op game.  An example of this is Rigger and Decker  have just been turned into magic users with the Rigger being a Shaman that "summons" drones instead of spirits, and the Decker is now a mage that cast "tech" spells to attack the enemy (yes, you read that correctly, Decker magic). The Rigger will also compete with any Shaman on your team for a summon spot, as your team is only allowed to summon 2 things.\n\n\n\n\n\n-original post-\n\nFinally, some real game innovation as Shadowrun Chronicles takes a truly unique approach the the turn-based strategy game.\n\nWith the introduction of new Lag-based™ gameplay that gives people time to multi-task other activities as they try to find time in their busy schedules to play games.\n\nDo you have a book that you just never got around to reading? Well, Cliffhanger Productions has the solution for you with  Lag-based™ gameplay! Thats right, just issue your command to "walk accross room"  or "examine item" and then take your time to leisurely read a page or two as Shadowrun Chronicles waits to complete your commmand.\n\nBut wait, theres more!  If you buy right now, you will also get to experience the thrill of the new Never-Sure™ technology. Thats right, as the tension builds as the seconds tick away, you will experience the glory of Never-Sure™ as you think to yourself "maybe this isn't lag, maybe I just didn't click the mouse". Yes, Never-Sure™ technology will have you questioning your sanity at the 20 second mark, and have you convinced at the 30 second mark that this time you really did forget to click the mouse button; but then as if by magic your charicter finaly opens the door and you breath a sigh of relief.  Never-Sure™ technology will ensure each move you make will send you on a rollercoaster ride of emotion; hope, fear, anger, sadness, will all be yours with each command you issue.","May 2, 2015","true","133.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","15"

The balancing of the game nerfs the team cannot have rigger and other summoners on the same team, cannot deploy multiple riggers. Theres a lack of bad guys you fight most of them are simple gunners. Next is the lack of ability to revive a teammate, a teammate goes down and you have 5 turns to finish the mission and escape. This is not how shadowrunners work in the RPG a guy goes down you get the job done regarudless. There also seems to be a lack of ability to revive a someone after they go down. Medkits or the basic ability to heal you or yourteam mates have to be found and your limited to 2 of them per run. I'd rather a weight system, I can only carry two medkits but I have cybernetic limbs... which is silly. I think if they work on the balancing it could be a lot of fun. Yes 4 riggers could swarm a map, so put the ability to hack drones in so they loose the drones.. you swarm with 4 riggers and your going to be in a world of hurt.\n\n","December 17, 2015","false","41.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have not played and will not play any multiplayer. I have played through the entire game once with a pistol/blades elf. I don\'t regret playing it and generally had fun, but there are some major shortcomings. I won\'t be replaying or buying any DLC.\n\nPROS:\n1) Turn-based squad combat is fun.\n2) Even if rather limited, it is set in the Shadowrun universe. There is no substitute for that.\n3) Character customization is pretty well done.\n\nCONS:\n1) Requires login to servers to play and you are forced to see the global chat.\n2) No choices to be made in the story until the very end. You can choose not to do side missions, but those are just inconsequential grinding for money and experience.\n3) Writing was boring and lifeless. Didn\'t use contractions.\n4) Weapon progression seemed silly. You save up a bunch of money waiting for new weapons and armor in the shop and then buy the best new weapons an armor. Thing is, you don\'t even know what you are saving up for until it\'s available and once it is, you can probably just buy everything you want immediately.\n5) No documentation\n6) No Matrix\n7) Deckers doing damage to everything short of magical creatures with their deck seemed silly.\n8) Mages not having access to a physical attack seemed like an artificial limitation.\n9) Henchmen (NPC runners) can only have single offensive skill. This made melee henchmen nearly useless. You need to use cover in this game and it is not easy to do that if you have to get up close to contribute at all.\n10) Henchmen can\'t have tactical items (e.g. medkits)\n11) No overwatch capability\n12) Wild camera movement during enemy turn makes it hard to see damage amounts as they appear\n13) Lots of map reuse. You can start me at a different end of the map, but it\'s still the same map.\n14) Missions started to feel very formulaic.

Cover, mark, fire, slice, rinse, and repeat.\n15) Every character gets two actions per turn and attacking ends the character\'s turn. Unless you get a temporary bonus, you can\'t just attack twice.

This is not a part of the other more popular Shadowrun series which is also on steam and which I would highly recommend.\n\nFirst off, I am a complete sucker for turn based tactical games of this nature. I absolutely can't get enough of them. The idea of being able to play a game like that with some buddies is an intriguing one to say the least. I am grateful this game exists, if only for the possibility that more games might attempt a similar formula and hopefully do it much better.\n\nSadly though, there may be a story in Shadowrun Chronicles, but other than there being a lockdown in Boston in which you and your pals are stuck, i'm really not sure what it is. There's some nonsense about increasingly stupidly named "corps" (the big corporations which are the social leaders in the shadowrun universe) being up to no good in some vague way and there are AI zombies and dragons involved somehow. That's about all I was able to gleam from the ridiculously inept story telling and confusing, poor dialogue.\n\nAlso, the voice acting made it difficult to concentrate for any length of time on what was being said. My orc character seemed to me like the voice was copied straight from the normal human male and pitch shifted down with some cheap software. It really sounded awful.\n\nThe game quickly devolves then into a series of pointless missions that go on for just a tad too long before culminating in a boss fight so difficult that the universally accepted way of beating it involves hiding in a small room for long periods of time.\n\nOverall, it's not a game I would recommend to anyone but the most die-hard of Shadowrun fans or turn based tactical connoseurs, and even then I would only recommend it with the affidavit that it is mostly not very good.","April 5","false","31.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Models and graphics are pretty good, actually -- ragdolls are nicely done, too. Visually, this game is decent. Soundtrack and setting tend to reflect the universe very well! It's almost like a throwback to Shadowrun Returns for me, especially with the organ mission.\n\nThe game itself feels clunky and customization fairly limited. Where I looked at my character in Shadowrun Returns and even Dragonfall, and was in love, I couldn't quite say the same. Understandably, the skill trees have been condensed and simplified, but it doesn't help someone who came from one game where it felt like having complete say in a character to one of the same setting and having very, very little. Comparatively, there's little -- if any -- attachment to the lore or setting. All of it seems very arbitrary. All in all, not worth the $29.99 charged, but also not a terrible game in its own right. I do wish I had tried something else, though.\n\nSo far, for early access -- not bad. Not bad, but not very encouraging. I'm hoping things develop more along the way.","November 9, 2014","false","2.4"," 16 of 35 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","16","35","0","1"

In any shape or form.  It's a combat only game with no spell variation for mages, no real spells for summoners and NO MATRIX.  Now, take this turn based combat only game and put a drekkin fragtard shadowrun candy shell on it... and that's what you have.\n\nIf that's all you want... then wiz... this game is for you.  If you want ACTUALLY Shadowrun, then you're drek outta luck - just geek this game now and wait for Shadowrun Hong Kong, because this is NOTHING like shadowrun, other than combat only.\n\nTo give you an example, deckers cannot deck into ANYTHING and "hacking" is a skill anyone can take on the MIND tree... not even on the hacking tree.  If you're a decker, you're basically a "techno-mage" with tech based "spells" that somehow affect metahumans and tech enemies (robots, drones, etc) but not animals.  If you're a mage, it's just the opposite... you have like 5 spells total... manabolt, manaball, shield, haste and mana surge.  That's it... those are the only spells you will ever cast. And most of them won't affect tech enemies.  And if you get a upgraded spell too early, you may not have enough magical endurance to cast it.\n\nAs for traditional weapon based skills... you have a whole skill tree for each weapon type (auto, pistol, etc.) You get a massive clip size of 2 or 4 depending on your weapon type, so plan to reload every other turn or so.  Not only that, but the game controls when you can get upgraded guns.\n\nCyberware is EXTREMELY limited, pretty much just making it combat oriented only - with essence cost being an underplayed afterthought.\n\nThis is a turn based combat only game with a shadowrun wrapper.  But there's nothing Shadowrun under the hood.  As long as you want the "idea" of shadowrun and not Shadowrun itself, you should like the game.\n\nEdit - Now that it is out, I have only one word to describe it - LAG.  The game is so laggy that you can literally wait 10 minutes to complete one turn, then another 5 minutes for the enemies to move. It's unplayable for all but the most dedicated fanboi's.  No communication about changes, patches, etc.  10 minute notices for server reboots, which fix the lag issue for about 15 minutes.\n\nIt's terrible and inexcusable.  There wasn't a single STRESS TEST during the entire beta/early release time.","April 19, 2015","false","195.8"," 16 of 35 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","16","35","0","0"

I regret it. This thing is terrible.\n\nFirst:\nThere's no tactical depth. You cannot set your guys to overwatch. You can't even bloody shoot and then move (it's move and then shoot only). This results in a game where your 'tactical' options consist of blandly moving from cover to cover and tossing dice at enemy soldiers. Is it "hard"? Sure. You'll take a crit to the face and be decked. HP is so low and healing options are so limited that that'll probably be it for you. But is there any strategy to it? Very, very little. This isn't XCom or Dragonfall and options are too limited to make it a true tactical experience.\n\nSecond:\nThe story is rubbish. You don't get dialogue or roleplaying choices, just some (horribly acted) dialogue that strings together some incredibly mundane and uninspired missions. "Go here and shoot these guys for some contrived reason". I like the Shadowrun universe, but if you're going into this expecting to find anything resembling the Glory side story from Dragonfall, then prepare for disappointment.\n\nThird:\nThere's no enemy variety. For the first few hours of this game all you are fighting are shirtless dwarves with baseball bats and dogs. You could at least change the colour of the dogs or something guys. Everyone also uses the same sound file, so expect to kill a bunch of female enemies that grunt like men when you drop them. Talk about lack of polish.\n\nFourth:\nThe game is plagued by bad design, bugs and lag issues. Take a look at the community hub and see the company begging for forgiveness. It's pathetic and these guys clearly weren't ready for go-time. I've had to Alt-F4 out of the game multiple times because I joined the party while talking to someone.  Sometimes I'll use a skill and have it go into cooldown and nothing will happen. You can moan about this being the first week of release or whatever, but that doesn't make any of this ♥♥♥♥ close to being acceptable.\n\nFifth:\nEvery time a mission ends, you have to spend a minute slogging back to a green 'mission complete' zone to end it. This is ♥♥♥♥ing tedious and makes me sick.\n\nAll in all: This game is about a year of design away from being even remotely good. Do not buy it, not even on sale.","May 4, 2015","false","8.0"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","8","19","2","1"

And I don't even talk about the risk to not anymore being able to play a game if the editor decide to stop the server because it's not enough used anymore or because they go bankrupt.\nAll those issues don't exist on offline game...\nSo, even if I loved to play this game (except the final mission which is way too difficult), I don't recommend to buy it only as a form of boycott to discourage devs to do games that force you to play online.","May 1, 2015","false","38.5"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

There's no legwork, the interactivity of deckers and mages with the elements of the map is so poor (well, for mages there isn't any as long as I know), the coop missions is just to repeat previous missions once and once again... And then there's the 20 daily server restarts due to technical and lag issues, which is funny because this is a heavily instanced game with not so many players to justify these problems. The current state of the game is a bad copy of Shadowrun Returns, with poorer mechanics (for example, no matrix gameplay) and story. It looks like they took away all the interesting points when they changed the name. I hope it gets better soon, or it will have a really sort life.

A nivel de jugabilidad, reduce las cuatro fases de un run (encuentro con el Johnson, legwork, infiltración y pago) a básicamente una (infiltración); a mayores, incluso esta fase le han quitado todos los aspectos de contacto, planificación y sigilo, dejando solo un juego de estrategia por turnos que, en realidad, es una copia cutre de XCOM. A mayores, aunque los no roleros no lo noten, se salta por completo la mecánica de juego del juego de rol, ignorando cosas como que la matriz es wireless o que los espíritus no se invocan x turnos sino por servicios. Al final, por todo ello, la personalización de las clases es bastante menor de lo que debería ser. El coop opcional no lo salva, la verdad.\n\nJunto a esto, a nivel gráfico tampoco se salva. Shadowrun es un universo oscuro y cyberpunk, distópico y con muchas sombras... no un despliegue de colores con estilo cartoon. Y no sólo a nivel de texturas y demás, sino el diseño de los personajes es en la mayor parte del tiempo ridículo. A nivel de sonido el juego cumple sin alardes, la música lo mismo, y no tiene voces dobladas.\n\nEl resultado es un juego que podría haber dado mucho pero no lo da.

= didn't get to do any~ there's no basic group functions for a fun quick slap together PUG play =\\nshouting LFG class blahblahblah~ wtf is this the 90's\n\n=======\n\nfirst offs this is one of my big rant reviews of thoroughly giving a game a good chance and trying my absolutes hardest to stay positives abouts it while trying my best to really enjoy the product and share to you my view on a game from someone with 25+ years gaming experience, a modder, an old school pen&paper RPG making creator, with a few classes or so of university experience in the game developement industry, games are my life, it's what i do.  however my outlook is one of a retired pro gamer that wants to relax~ i'm not a casual gamer, my casual relaxing = your hardcore~\n\ni've gotten burnt outs over the years for most genres, but i do appreciate hard work on games from the devs cuz i know how much work every little thing needs to work in a game... i'm no stranger to the game developement process.  i have a mechanical mind as well as a very artistic~like creative view on things.  i appreciate art, and understand the work and effort one goes through in making it, along with the mechanical knowledge of how things work from models, textures, codes, pathing, etc....  i may not fully know every single possible detail, but i have a very good knowledgable understanding to appreciate and admire all the effort that goes into every little thing in a game.\n\ni thought this game woulda had more done with basic gameplay functions by now after all this time... why not storyline quest reward respec karma once, can't earn agains and be dones with its~ no freakin' respec willy nilly but you still gets one to redo your mistakes.  i started this game thinking all the abilities would behave similar to shadowrun returns, but it's nothing like that, and i'm tired of remaking my character over and over again with no respec in sight, seeing threads from 2014/2015 waaaaaaaay back saying it on wishlist or somethings and never ever doing it at all.  no character sheet or quest log window key like really... lol basic stuff.  a lfg party matcher woulda been basic stuff too~ i mean we're not in the early 2000's anymores lol these are really basic things for an online mmo~ish game =/ makes me sad cuz i was looking forward to playing a shadowrun game agains, but the slow developement on basic things is very disheartening.\n\ni dunno how much trouble unity is giving the devs, but when i look at the horrible UI functions, it makes me wanna just go play something else cuz it gives the image that the studio isn't doing well, and when i asked if there was a key for charactersheet/quests day1 get snappy attitude from some guy, ok not a good way to attract new costumers to the game if that's what this games small playerbase is likes =\ i thoughts being an older rpg from the old days woulda attracted more of the older nicer peoples from the old days of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ming, not more of the typical bad child~like attitudes you see everywhere else :|\n\ni spents hours playing already, looking for a respec on google to see @what mission i can expect to earn my one free respec to ease my mind, that i EXPECTED to be there like all mmo's have after finishing a story or somethings you know.  like every mmo in existence has :| playthru game unlock costume thingies, etc.etc. finds that i don't enjoy my initial weapon selections as much as i wanted and saw these cool things like spellcasters fling powerful energy thingies and stuffs, and i wanted to just go into mage after giving it a longer lookovers... but nothings after all this time =( really... just puts it as a one time quest reward for storyline devs... seriously nots hard.  one time reward... it just a few lines of extra code not much lol sigh.\n\ngame needs some serious rebalancing too, one background way OP compared to another... stuff like that, no custom colored items, etc. etc. i dunno if unity has any material files or nots but the balancing for a turn based RPG likes this, it not hards lol not for a number based dice roll rpg game like this... i do it all the time =\ on paper for pen&paper RPG games like D&D, RIFTS, etc. , i studied those games like crazy back in the day, i literally finds how to min-max in pen&paper RPGs and balance it outs easily, doing 100+dmg in D&D for examples per swing lol, i mod games, i know what coding can be like i've been to college for it.  putting in a new window, assigning a key, and placing some basic value checks like what quests the player has available in the mission map, or a character sheet that displays even just a tad more info on yourselfs... more portraits i mean seriously like 5 portraits for female elf and human has like 12, but why so little after all these years... it's not a big picture... shoulds has like literally has at least 50 different portaits per race&sex by now.  it was a kickstarter game right?  did the devs ever reach outs to the community for aid.  i sure some gamers would've loved to make their own art or something for portaits or whatever you know.  you'd be surprised what a community for a game can do if you asked them.  i've seen some amazing things created in my years of gaming since the 90's\n\ni want to like the game, i really do, but in it's current state~ it's not very friendly to new costumers, especially ones that don't know shadowrun very well.  even to those that know a little from other titles and kinda has an idea what to expect are kinda likely to be pushed away as it doesn't even compare in basic functions to most older RPGs back in the 90's in UI terms.  i want to enjoy and play shadowrun stuffs i really do, ever since i first tried it outs with shadowrun returns i kinda really liked the setting and stuffs.  it was different, and i enjoyed it, tired of medieval fantasy games... so many over the years, however being an MMO like RPG, i finds that coming into the game with no one else, as a new player~ is a nightmare~ when i thoughts it was gonna be a bit funs... having a blast doing random PUGs with strangers and stuffs... insteads i finds the UI to be nonexistant, press every key nothings for informations... nothings =( not even proper tooltips for certain things~ slang cheatsheet? an accurate community guide? an active wiki page?...\n\nthe chat is the worst~ it's not inviting to see as you first enter the game~ LFG spam galores! yay... doesn't this look funs... an LFG timesink from the 90's / early 2000's~ not one of these please... it's 2016~ seriously~ grouping functions is basic MMORPG 101~ no one wants to sit&LFG\nstill have yet to party with anyone... let alones chat with anyone =\ the chat is just lfg spam so why bother chatting with that mess going on\n\ni just expected more functionality i guess by now, and the snappy attitudes ingame from the community well the one guy that does talk... isn't really motivating me to continue playing with that kinda playerbase =(\n\ni wish the devs the best, and if the unity engine is really that bad, i'm sorry =\\nnot sure if unity looked like a good choice back thens or what,\nbut i know there were other good reputable choices at the time...\n\ni hope you guys can make the game more new player friendly~ it's not like i want daily respec or anythings, i don't even like min~maxing, i prefer a theme like character where i stick to a certain style no matter the penalty/bonus cuz i don't care, i'm not a greedy child that wants to maximize everthings cuz woO~big#... i just wants to has funs~\ni wish the devs all successful lives, where~ever their decisions may lead~","April 8","false","23.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"

Everywhere else you just play a movie.\n\nYou expect a challenge and being abe to fail, atleast partially or fully depending on Main or Side quest:\n- It's but a slight challenge, and failiure is not an option, as you simply replay the level.\n\nYou expect the Shadowrun RPG system, atleast the core functionallity and system setup:\n- a few of the same terms and words are the same as the RPG, but it is absolutely not the Shadowrun 1st., 2nd., 3rd., 4th or 5th edition of the game, not even an X.5 edition. It this is the 6th edition, then in sticking to the older stuff.\n\nYou expect to experience the Astral realm and the Matrix, doing battle and the like:\n- You never see the Astral and the only scenes in the Matrix is the VR "living room" of your Johnson.\n\nYou expect your active skills and/or knowledge skills to play an active part in the game:\n- Well the would require it to be an RPG. This part of the RPG system is in no way included in the game.\n\nYou wish to play a new story on par with Harebrain Schemes's Dragonfall or the intro scenario to the core:\n- You should go buy a Harebrain Schemes game, and keep on the lookout for who made the game, just like I should have. I got blinded by the lovely "SHADOWRUN" name.\n\n\nWhat did they get right/not-wrong:\n- The game looks like a shadowrun game, spells, weapons, rigger equipment, decks, drones have the right names.\n- The language the characters use fits like a glove.\n- The story in itself isn't bad, about as good as the one in the Shadowrun game Harebrain Schemes started with.\n\n\nThe end feeling:\n- Someone tried to get this game on the marked at leat a full year too fast, and too late to just use the core/expand on the core, which Harebrain Schems made and placing the story there.\n- Too much focus on grafix, and too little on the system.\n- The end product is something that calls itself Shadowrun, but either fails in being the RPG system or they wished to make their own system, which makes little sense besides the brand","April 14","false","38.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

This game is inferior to shadowrun returns/dragonfall in almost every way. The writing is worse astheticly the game looks a lot worse with the use of lower quality 3d models as backgrounds as opposed to the digitally rendered art used in the aforementioned games and the game as a whole feels alot less polished than returns. The only way in which it improves upon its predicessors is with Co-op.\n\n2. Lack of dialogue options. They have essentially removed the RP part of an rpg. In the 3 hours I played this game can you geuss how many different dialougue options ive seen? 2!! 2! "hello" and "goodbye". The entire game is scripted with you playing a character whose personality has been determined entirely for you. The ability to change situations based on your characters chosen etiquette (something you cant even do in this game) has been a core mechanic of EVERY shadowrun game, both tabletop and videogame.\n\n3. BUGS BUGS BUGS BUGS BUGS....BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGSSSSSS. Models glitch out, there is clipping everywhere the game is super unresponsive (this may or may not have something to do with the fact that it tries to check in with the server like every 10 seconds)\n\n4.

MMOs have a wide range of activities you can follow.  They offer RP, crafting, exploration, public kudos, and best of all, when done right, a nonlinear story line that assure if you do not like a few adventures you are not stuck - you just work around them.  The city is a single dorky square with five vendors in it, whose weapons slowly get better as you do.  You never find better weapons on adventures, and while the clothing system is charming it is also limited.\n\nThe most disturbing thing is this idea that the entire charcter advancement system to endgame is nothing more than a normal MMO's noob area, and that at the end you will get to see the rest of the city in all of its glowing and really start playing,  Only there is no evidence that when you get 10 ranks in two or three areas that you will be released into a huge world, only that the MMO will have ended with a fizzle.\n\nOn the good side, the game is essentially a late alpha release with a Final Candidate price tag - a not uncommon experience.  That means it could grow.  Open the city up, expand the adventures, loose the linear designs, introduce housing and bars and mass transit, and the rest of the game experience and it could be a winner.","May 5, 2015","false","57.6"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","1"

It's a first game in my gaming history experience that presented a challange in language sense (I mean how often do you use words like 'myopic', 'reneg' or 'eidetic') and I love it!  Every sentence was gem. As a result every character had character, their own idenity. Characters, places, moments..\n4- Music - very indulging and allowing to really dive into the story.\n5 - Graphics - beautiful...locations, places..everything\n6 - Gameplay and interface - great, not perfect, but very good imho.\n\nI was so excited to hear of a new episode, Chronicles, then I bought it instantly and that was a shoot in the foot. And here's why:\n1. Graphics suck! Srsly, are we in 2002 again?? Not only the universe, but the interface as well...guys, did someone actually bother to QA the game? There are spelling errors and the font is just bleah...\n2. Voice over is B+ average. I did miss voiceover in Shadowrun, but with this I'm happy to go back to no voice at all. And what's with the half voiced and half not? And this clicking after every sentence...\n3. Character buildup - weird, it has no connection to the series at all. The perks are odd (why can you pick 'hacking' 3 times? What was wrong with using classinc numbering system?)\n4. Gameplay is a pain - sure, I understand the strategy element, but since you can't really scroll away to far, it almoast feels like you're moving in turtle pace. How many moves do you have to do to get from one corner to the other.\n5. Interface is confusing - my character died on my first mission and there was this odd icon that appeared stating most probalby that I have 5 turns before I..I don't know...like die completly but I had no idea what to do with it. I couldn't clik on a character, my NPCs where standing directly on her in a desprerate attempt to maybe save her like you would normaly with Trauma Kit in the old Shadowrun but nothing happened and I faid the mission.\n\nGeneral look and feel is just revolting. Sorry. From the moment my character woke up in that hospital I was like...whaaaa? what is that? Is this Shadowrun? Reeeeeally? Please, tell me it's not...\n\nAll in all, if you want to have it, at lease wait for a sale and get it for $4 as in my opinion it's not worth more, and definely not $20 I paid.","November 15, 2015","false","1.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","3"

Very basic system. Combatsystem is closer to jagged alience than RTS. So beware if You think you will continue you adventures from RTS in better graphic's. They have very little commen ground.\nAlso importaint to know its aimed at multiplayer co-op. If you Tend to go solo you will have to struggle with a very lowbuged henchman system were you take 1-3 (i guess either playermade or random generated) henchmen with you for that mission. Theres no party and you cant manipulate the henchmen. They are equipped pre-teamup, and use to very poor equipped. You yourself have 2 itemslots, but only players can utilize that option, hence the npc-henchmen never have a granade or a medpack. Not even a pill to help them. The enemy does. Your party have to share the 2 things you choose to bring. Theres is also no revives, stabalizes or anything in that direction other that the medkit. Did I say your party have to share those 2 things. Your combat options are also very basic and constricted. You have a main and maybe a secondary, most npc's only the main which makes them very specilized to handle enemys. Some are immune to magic and hence the mage have to find other targets to engage as his or her attacks cant harm that enemy and they havent got any options to use melee or alternative weapon. So very arcade'ish. Hopes for the future depth of the combat system complexity isnt high.\nIf you want online player co-op turn base and dont mind the low complexity this might be fun. If you have standards regarding that you will be happier with the top-down RTS:dragon fall or other. Ufo-series (not x-com).

Before played in Shadowrun Returns a while ago (wasn't impressed) and couple of days before playing this game, I finished Dragonfall Director's Cut (liked a lot).\n\nVisually Boston Lockdown looks bad... very clunky models of characters and that "sexy edge" which some outfits should provide is fall flat on its face... fall hard! Probably the best example came to mind - Vampires the Masquerade Redemption. Remember Christof Romuald from there? Models in Boston Lockdown are worse. Excuse me for beginning this er... opinion thingy from graphics, but they are very noticable... not in a good way.\n\nGameplay side in here is also far from scratching me in good places. I was super confused why my character decker had no idea what matrix is even after hacking was in background of that charcter. Also major issue - game is way too much action oriented. Basically hacking is not even close to that level of usefulness as it was in Dragonfall. Gameplay on the field is like XCom. Get to cover, move to flank enemy, shoot to kill! You barely need to use any skills. So far the best class - shotguns and AR. Just flank, shoot. Repeat.\n\nRather disapointing game.

I'll keep what I said before and add more:\n1. Character creation and stories are still overly simple and dull. Come on... Shadowrun is a complex system and games based on it are supposed to make you think much more than this. Sheesh... Are you making a game for babies with all these ready made choices and these silly dialogues?\n2. The interface is a mess that lacks lots of usability concepts, the music isn't synced to events, and the game is still performing horribly. As a software engineer myself I'm becoming curious as to what technology can be so bad to make such an unresponsive and clunky game... It's either what is being used or the competence of both designers and devs is not so good. Seriously... If I were a dev in this team I'd either vote for a complete reboot or quit my job because I wouldn't be able to stand our own product.\nThis game makes me want to tell this team to stop trying, which is a damn pity and makes me feel ♥♥♥♥ing bad too because I want to love every single thing based on Shadowrun but man... Getting back on this game to "check the updates" has given me depressive thoughts and kind of ruined my night.\n\nFirst review - Don't waste your money at least for now.\nI'll go straight to the point.\nThis is still in early access but I bought this game months ago and it hasn't been worth it up to now.\nStories are shallow, the animations and overall graphics are very unpleasant, and playability sucks because it doesn't even perform well or fast enough.\nThis game reaches the point of being a lack of respect to the cyberpunk community.\nThe worst workshop campaign of Shadowrun Returns / Dragonfall is much better than this.","September 20, 2014","false","7.9"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","11","27","0","5"

In fact, the hot mess that it exists as presently will make up quite a bit of the Shadowrun experience.\n\nI'm incredibly disappointed in the linear garbage this team pumped out under the title "Shadowrun Online", and I -hate- that at the last second, they've chosen to change that name and stick with producing ultra-linear garbage. Consider, as well, the Shadowrun titles that have come out as of late; Singleplayer campaigns, a poorly made deathmatch shooter, and now this.\n\nWe can only hope some other startup happens to capture Neuromancer a little better than Shadowrun did in the first place.","March 4, 2015","false","11.6"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","8","21","2","1"

If you like Shadowrun 5th Edition don't expect this game to scratch that itch right now. I think it has potential for sure. Graphics are solid, gameplay is fun, although some missions are too hard. I like where the game is going and hope the money I contributed helps to make the game come to fuition. This needs to be the attitude you go into this game with. If you want a good Shadowrun mmo in the future then I say support this with a purchase but you will NOT be getting that expected expereince right now and it's going to be a while before you do. I hope that some of the simplistic elements are overhauled. Deckers can't do anything close to their counterparts in the pen and paper version. Magic is way too simplified and needs expansion.

The problem is that it's still very content-light; it lacks the features and depth you'd expect of competitors like Shadowrun Returns.\n\nThe progression system and gameplay diverges heavily from the Pen-and-Paper ruleset, and is pretty unremarkable.  The game has potential, but there is so little content that you can see pretty much everything on offer well before the end of the main story.\n\nThe lack of class / XP limits means it's only a matter of time until all characters have maxed out abilities in all fields - so there is pretty much no individuality between characters - and that's if you ignore how superficial the choices presented in the skill-trees are.\n\nThe Shadowrun setting is well realised and atmospheric as ever, but unfortunately the game just doesn't do enough with it to justify buying it at present.  That said, it's not "un-fun"; it can be strangely addictive despite its flaws.  But there's better examples of both the game's genre, and of cyber-punk settings, out there to play with.","May 21, 2015","false","21.9"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

It's so bad that I'm writing a review to complain about how bad it is.\n\nIf you like your RPGs to have a story and NPCs with actual background stories, I would skip this game.

So laggy it takes MINUTES between triggering an action and the action taking place. Constantly locking up during loading screens. Patches with no patch notes. Downtimes with no warning or posts about it on any medium. Constant nerfs.\n\nNo way to respec your skills even after they ruin skills you picked despite the promise of refunding points if they make skill changes.\n\nshops having items for sale at the correct mission progress but once you can afford them they're not on the shop anymore.\n\nOnly viable way to play is be a cybered up elf with automatic weapons because cyberware gives you crazy bonuses that non-cyber characters can't even compete with. Hell the highest auto in the game is vastly superior to any other weapon even before you add cyberware.\n\nNo information at all, be it in game like what exactly this skill does, or any info from devs about what changed this patch, when they're going to take down the server.\n\nNo ignore function to block the toxic "should be playing league of legends" players. No whisper so you can talk to people without trying to get your message seen in global chat through all the complaining about lag.\n\nNo LFG function so you just have to spam the already spammy global chat. henchmen allow you to run a NPC person on the team but they're so bloody weak compared to players with their bad skill choices and lack of secondary weapon that you're stuck LFG until you find 3 people or just get tired of waiting and quit.\n\nDevelopers are so busy posting video's of themselves PLAYING shadowrun when they should be FIXING shadowrun.\n\nMost of the rules we know from the books are thrown out so forget the paper rule books as none of it applies and you'll end up having to remake your characters if you base decisions that way since there's no real data to go off of. (manastorm: DEVISTATES enemies in a large area... 16 dmg is devistates? when everyone has 30-50hp by then??? and it takes ALL your mana???)\n\nDecking is called Hacking but tehre's also a "loot skill" called hacking so it gets confusing when talking to potential team members (can you hack? yeah I'm a hacker. *invite, start mission* hack over here, oh I can't hack those, I didn't get that skill, thought you asked if I used hacking weapon)\n\nThey decided to remove the ability to sell cosmetic clothing items but you still get multiples of the same items when looting in missions ending up with tons of duplicates you can't do anything with or get rid of, even clothes YOU START THE GAME WITH!!!\n\nEveryone takes their turn at the same time, it's advertised as a feature but it's a problem. team members are constantly running into area of effect attacks, made even worse with all this lag. Sure you can warn them but it never helps since they have to read chat first.\n\nbought this when it was Shadowrun online, before any real info was out, hoping for an actual MMO but instead I got a very poorly done, cheap chinese Shadowrun Returns, with multiplayer capability, knock off.\n\nAnd, I'm sorry, but "it's launch week" and "we didn't expect this many players on a STEAM game" haven't been acceptable excuses for over a decade. Do some damned research before making an online game. we got 20+ years of examples showing what can happen on launch week and what happens when you launch on STEAM. games that were out for years without issues and choose to go on STEAM have these problems all over again. I know it won't eliminate all the issues with launch but it will reduce the issues and make the company more prepared to quickly resolve those issues.\n\nI'll check back in a month.

Thats over a year of owning the title and wondering how to properly ask for a refund.\n\nAudio: 3/5\nMusic: 3/5\nVoiceacting: 1/5\nGraphics: 2/5\nMap: 2/5\nGameplay: 0/5\nShadowrun: N/A\n\nPros:\n- 1st of all, let me talk about the positive stuff concerning this "game", I sent an E-Mail last weekend to ask for a refund and I should get my money back in the next few days. Thanks Florian.\n\nCons:\n- This is def not the Shadowrun game you are looking for.\n- As a matter of fact, this is a "AErena had a baby with X-Com" kind of clone, with Trolls skin.\n- I would go so far as to say that this isnt even a game to begin with.\n- The dev started with a kickstarter project, then half the team ran of and those who stayed used the game funding to make another game - AErena. Then they had to drop most of what they initially had planned for the game and came out with that "good enough" pile of crap that is scheduled to launch in less than 2\two weeks...\n- Each time someone speak their mind to let the dev know they failed, and bring constructive criticism and ideas to improve the project, Primetide and his army of "Trolls" come in and work hard to justify all the BS and crappyness. They go so far as deleting posts and complete threads, with the occasionnal "accidental" merging of threads followed by more excuses as to why they have no clue what they are doing...\n- Anyway, the Audio aint too bad I guess, Music falls on my nerves but it could be worse, the Voiceacting is just horrible, Graphics are cartoony and have a huge AErena feel to them, Maps are wayyyy to small but the different elements fits well together nowadays, the Gameplay is pure BS and its Shadowrun by name only...\n\nAll in all, if you like Shadowrun, stay clear of this title or you will hate yourself for wasting money on it.\nIf after reading this review you still feel like this "game" is worth a try and dont believe its as bad as im portrayed it to be then be my guest and buy it, then whenever you feel yourself doubting your decision of buying this title, just remember the 1st line of this review.\n\nYou guys have a good one\n\nJP\n\nThis is not the Shadowrun game you are looking for!!!\n\n~This review is dedicated to Primetide, with love.","April 15, 2015","false","34.9"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","7","22","0","3"

Clunky controls, limited powers, no equiptment upgrades and poor turn base options makes this game a horriable installment. Sorry but this plays more of a puzzle game than a tactics game and  this is obvious in the first mission of the game. Now i only played through 3 missions but after being whiped out the 11th time becouse my guys could not hit a target at point blank with a sword i decided to call it quits. It also dosnt make since that your guys can die in  2 to 3 hits while the enemy can take 4 or 5 and out number you. There is no armor or ways to heal in this game so again i revert to puzzle game instead of a rpg. This game would had been better if it was done for a phone app and call it "try to have one man standing in the yellow zone at the end of the round without whipping" becouse that is how the missions play out and how you beat them. No real skill just know how the puzzle works just like most puzzle games and youre done.\n\nPlease add substance to the game and a way to actually make a bad ♥♥♥ toon and i will change my review. The skill tree even though is nice idea and hacking does somthing in the real world is nice the lack of upgrading and a money system to buy items to help in the game is going to hurt it a lot. I also dont understand why you have races with no traits except looks? just like the clothing that does nothing in the game i guess.\n\nIf you want to see how this could had been done right then play shadowrun returns or the returns directors cut and you will see what i am talking about.","January 11, 2015","false","1.6"," 5 of 19 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","5","19","0","1"

The reason is that they are trying to blame the fans and backers for thinking the game was going to be an mmorpg...which was the original plan!\n\nCliffhanger productions is the most unethical company i have seen.  All of their positive reviews on steam are from friends,  family and people they give free access codes to.  Once a month they have open houses and give away free access codes,  then asked people to review the game.  90% of the positive reviews on steam are free access users.  This is how they falsely manipulate user reviews. They try despertly to keep the steam rating mixed which should be, without manipulation, overwhelmingly negative.\n\nI don't have allot of time explaining how horrible this game is,  just read the negative reviews to get an honest review.\n\nIf you originally backed this project on kickstarter...contact kickstarter and inform them of this Cliffhangers lies and practices.

I like where the new version is heading but is still missing a lot of the quirks that made the Shadowrun universe such a great background to develop into a video game. For instance, I understand that the devs don't want it to be a clone of Shadowrun Return but that game used the fourth edition as a template and made sense to a table player. I applaud the new improvements and will be on the look out for other changes, I wish for the addition of the adept class and powers and more look custumization options...

Now that I have played the game for a couple of days, I would like to share my findings with you.\n\nThe overall feel of the game 5/5\nIt delivers the feeling of the Shadowrun universe perfectly. Some players are not happy with the character customization, some want more content, or more MMO utility out of it, but I think we can all agree that when you jump into the mission together with your fellow runners, the shooting starts and a hive controller is wailing at you, now thats how Shadowrun should feel like. I give a solid 5 out of 5 here.\n\nCharacter customization 3/5\nThis is always a cricital point of every game with RPG elements. The hardcore wants to have all the options, the softcore wants to jump into the play with choosing a pre-planned levelling path. Compared to Shadowrun Returns / Dragonfall (they would get 5/5), this game has simplified build mechanics, but that doesnt mean you cant make choices, or cant screw it up! I give a score of 3 because this simpler character building is more appealing to the masses, and compared to a single player game, we do want some company here.\n\nHow the multiplayer feels 5/5\nThis is a turn based strategy game, what is bound to be sluggish at least, because players are weighing options, choosing skills, thinking about the best tactics - every single time they make a turn. This was my biggest fear when I was thinking how the multiplayer will fare in Shadowrun Chronicles. But, and kudos to the devs here, its not sluggish, you dont feel like waiting for anybody unless they really take their time of course. Your actions and the turns flow in a comfortable pace, and apart from the occasional lagspike, it never felt slower than single player to me. A solid 5 out of 5 for the implementation.\n\nContent 2/5\nThe quests are great, not too much detail to bore the action boys, but still enough to make you feel part of the world, and with voice acting too what really helps the atmosphere. There are just not too many of them (yet, the devs claim), and after you conquer all, not much is left to do apart from replaying them. You can probably finish off the entire main questline in a week, and that is first time playing it, and taking it slow. If you only have one or two hours to play in the evenings it will last you longer, but in summer break a dedicated runner can beat the whole thing in 5 days.\n\nThey either have to heat up those end game challenges / give us more main quests, or work on the replayability. All of these are promised by the devs already, who are a lovely bunch by the way, their communication is outstanding. I give 2 out of 5 here because if you have a real life and can only play in the evenings, the main questline will entertain you for weeks, and thats not too bad.\n\nIs this an MMO at all? 2/5\nIf you expected the traditional MMO experience, you will be disappointed. This game is more like a single player game where you can play with your buddies.\n\nThere is no support function for organizing groups, no guilds (although there is a friends list function), and the chat system is so basic that you cant even whisper to another player. You have global chat where the runs are organized, and party chat when you are in a mission with your fellow runners. No shared bank to exchange items between your characters, and absolutely no way to trade between players.         <- If a developer reads this, you can take all of these as my suggestions to improve the game.\n\nThe balance between running with players and hiring henchmen is perfect though, so I give it 2 out of 5. You are never forced to group with anyone, you can go single player all the way, still if you group, its more fun. This kind of flexibility is a must in todays gaming. Players want to have a choice, and not to be forced into grouping with random strangers.\n\nAll in all, thank you developers for making a game I enjoy this much, and I ll see you online chummers.\n\nTenet","June 20, 2015","true","72.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now that I have played the game for a couple of days, I would like to share my findings with you.\n\nThe overall feel of the game 5/5\nIt delivers the feeling of the Shadowrun universe perfectly. Some players are not happy with the character customization, some want more content, or more MMO utility out of it, but I think we can all agree that when you jump into the mission together with your fellow runners, the shooting starts and a hive controller is wailing at you, now thats how Shadowrun should feel like. I give a solid 5 out of 5 here.\n\nCharacter customization 3/5\nThis is always a cricital point of every game with RPG elements. The hardcore wants to have all the options, the softcore wants to jump into the play with choosing a pre-planned levelling path. Compared to Shadowrun Returns / Dragonfall (they would get 5/5), this game has simplified build mechanics, but that doesnt mean you cant make choices, or cant screw it up! I give a score of 3 because this simpler character building is more appealing to the masses, and compared to a single player game, we do want some company here.\n\nHow the multiplayer feels 5/5\nThis is a turn based strategy game, what is bound to be sluggish at least, because players are weighing options, choosing skills, thinking about the best tactics - every single time they make a turn. This was my biggest fear when I was thinking how the multiplayer will fare in Shadowrun Chronicles. But, and kudos to the devs here, its not sluggish, you dont feel like waiting for anybody unless they really take their time of course. Your actions and the turns flow in a comfortable pace, and apart from the occasional lagspike, it never felt slower than single player to me. A solid 5 out of 5 for the implementation.\n\nContent 2/5\nThe quests are great, not too much detail to bore the action boys, but still enough to make you feel part of the world, and with voice acting too what really helps the atmosphere. There are just not too many of them (yet, the devs claim), and after you conquer all, not much is left to do apart from replaying them. You can probably finish off the entire main questline in a week, and that is first time playing it, and taking it slow. If you only have one or two hours to play in the evenings it will last you longer, but in summer break a dedicated runner can beat the whole thing in 5 days.\n\nThey either have to heat up those end game challenges / give us more main quests, or work on the replayability. All of these are promised by the devs already, who are a lovely bunch by the way, their communication is outstanding. I give 2 out of 5 here because if you have a real life and can only play in the evenings, the main questline will entertain you for weeks, and thats not too bad.\n\nIs this an MMO at all? 2/5\nIf you expected the traditional MMO experience, you will be disappointed. This game is more like a single player game where you can play with your buddies.\n\nThere is no support function for organizing groups, no guilds (although there is a friends list function), and the chat system is so basic that you cant even whisper to another player. You have global chat where the runs are organized, and party chat when you are in a mission with your fellow runners. No shared bank to exchange items between your characters, and absolutely no way to trade between players.         <- If a developer reads this, you can take all of these as my suggestions to improve the game.\n\nThe balance between running with players and hiring henchmen is perfect though, so I give it 2 out of 5. You are never forced to group with anyone, you can go single player all the way, still if you group, its more fun. This kind of flexibility is a must in todays gaming. Players want to have a choice, and not to be forced into grouping with random strangers.\n\nAll in all, thank you developers for making a game I enjoy this much, and I ll see you online chummers.\n\nTenet","June 20, 2015","true","72.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game feels like XCOM: Enemy Unkown set in the Shadowrun universe except instead of a focus on building your base and squad, it's all about building up your one character. Every mission is heavily combat-focused, there's no dialogue options or speech-skills. Instead the greater focus on combat means missions are built with this in mind with lots of fighting however they're usually quick affairs with longer runs being broken up into several encounters. The game is co-op focused however if you're running solo fear not! The game has a very interesting henchmen system whereby if you are going solo or below the game's (generally) 4-player size requirement, you can place into your team characters made by other players under your control, meaning you can cruise through this game solo if you want.\nTL:DR - If you want a Shadowrun RPG with a bit more of an XCOM flavour, you've found it.

Being a single player person I was wondering whether this game would do it for me but after giving it a chance I have to say it is a good game.\n\nWhile Boston Lockdown may not have the full-fledged RPG mechanics of SR and SR:D (favouring a somewhat simpler skill tree) it is a Shadowrun experience with turn-based tactical combat, good 3D - if simple - graphics and - more importantly to me - you can solo the story campaign without problems if you build your character carefully. The story is interesting and there is character building across the campaign. One thing to bear in mind is that multiple aspects of the rich Shadowrun world (which is a long running pen and paper RPG first) are not fully introduced so it would be better if you play another Shadowrun game first to familiarise yourself with the setting so as to fully enjoy it.\n\nOf course this being an online co-op-focused game, the game's hub is one relatively small map that acts as a stop-over shopping and discussion location where you will see other players walking around but you can solo the whole thing without problems. As the main story progresses the hub changes to reflect current events and you do get side missions regularly after the introductory missions are over. The only thing preventing this being a serviceable offline SR game is the always online requirement (saves are server side) and the small easy to ignore chat window on the bottom left. As the developers do not have the rights to make an offline game this is an understandable compromise but I do hope it gets a full offline mode sometime in the future so the game lives on past the servers. The difficulty especially in the beginning is quite high which makes for an interesting challenge and pushes you to plan and execute carefully.\n\nSo TL;DR: Yes, this is a good Shadowrun game for single player types and scratches that turn based Shadowrun itch in between the Harebrained studios core entries.","April 8","true","33.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
