The story is interesting and the underlying mystery is fun to unravel. The characters have depth and the script provides a great balance of humor and substance. There are a multitude of sidequests, however none of them wield much of any kind of reward. The battle system is marred by a lack of equipment, and battles seems to make up for being scarce by providing enemies with ridiculously high health and attack power. Still, it is doable. Overall I would say that Edolie is a great game for point and click adventure fans, but those hoping for a classic RPG should expect more story than action.","March 10, 2015","true","4.9"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","0"

Bears a stiking similarity to other Eridani Games releases and the influence of the Aveyond Series from Amaranth Games can be felt.  Characters are interesting and have definite personalities.  Visually, it is a beautiful RPG Maker XP-style game with well-drawn art, and my personal favorite menu bar style (borrowed from the Aveyond Series) along the bottom of the screen.\n\nAll that said, I do wish there were more chances to explore and slightly less linear gameplay.  After a certain point, you cannot deviate from the path.  Meaning that if you intended to complete some side quests before facing the final boss, you have not got this option unless you do so IMMEDIATELY.  I am not sure if there are multiple endings, but the ending I got was generally a good ending, but not as satisfying as I'd like.\n\nI'd love to see the characters be a bit more developed by the end of the game, particularily the protagonist, as she seems to experience the least change in the game.   Overall, the game is enjoyable.  If you're like me, you'll appreciate the ability to fairly easily dodge the enemies, and the high focus on story.\n\nThe one issue I really cannot get past in this game is the expensive healing items, coupled with the moderately overpowered enemies, and certain party members being near useless in the later chapters (you get 6 by the end).\n\nIf you want a RPG Maker Fantasy game, really love Eridani Games' content or are looking for a game that's very story-oriented, this game is for you.  If you're looking for a traditional RPG Adventure game, you may want to look elsewhere.","April 19, 2015","true","20.8"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game to completion.\n\nPROS:\n\n-Great replayability (3 game paths and multiple endings)\n-Original storyline\n-Appropriate gamelength (10-16 hours depending on how much of a completionist you are)\n-Great soundtrack\n-Many sidequests\n-Lighthearted, countryside atmosphere\n\nCONS:\n\n-Sidequests will get removed when you progress too far in the story since you can't backtrack from region to region.\n-Some sidequests involve obscure ways to complete and can involve a lot of going back and forth over long distances.\n-Some drastic difficulty spikes in encounters when you enter a new region.\n-Party members who join later in the story don't get a lot of characterization.\n\nAll in all, I felt the cons of the game weren't too bad and were pretty tolerable. For an RPG Maker game, I give this an 8/10","June 3, 2015","true","14.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I saw Edolie and it had a red haired heroine. Okay, you've got my attention. Her name is Willow? You don't say, that is awesome, I'm on board.\n\nWhile I usually like to have achievements as 'goals' to reach, the lack of in Edolie does not take away from it as a game. If it had them it would definitely make playthroughs more enjoyable but I digress.\n\nIn this title, there are a lot of quests to take on and a lot to explore in the world of Edolie, making for a very worthwhile game.\n\n(Willow is mine and you can't have her!)","January 2","true","2.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game has a really nice enjoyable theme and really nice art work. Love how happy this game is meanwhile also everything is turned upside down by evilness. The story itself is also really nice, there totally has been thought good about it and all makes sense in the end. Even though  the game isn't that hard, the final boss really is hard. It takes a really long time. Because of that I didn't played it for a few little months and just now tried it again. Once you understand it, it will get easy but still takes a lot of time. So I realised I gave up way too soon. Regretting that now.\n\nThe only down point I would give this game is about the little side missions you can do. I would go out and search for whatever I needed to find but when you realised you've gone way to far into the game, you cannot finish that quest anymore. Meanwhile it keeps staying in your journal.\n\nBut anyways, a really good joyfull game for that price. :3","February 23","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
