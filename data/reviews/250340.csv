What i'm about to tell you actually ♥♥♥♥ing happened.\n\nI joined an rp server with 15 people. At first i was confused, and went around being a general knob, stealing cars, sitting on people, ect. Somehow i didnt get banned for fail RP. After about an hour of observing these people mingle around, I decided to join in. I sat with them as they put some dude on trial for some reason. Then, everyone got in a treehouse and there was lava and blah blah blah it was interesting, but this isnt the best part. So, after this, everyone started to properly RP. People went to their houses, got their cars, ect. Intrigued by this, I decided to stalk an unsuspecting household and observe everyday life in Blockland. Soon enough, they relised i was watching them, and they dubbed me 'the stalker under the porch' and 'the creepy guy by the window'. I stood around, holding a bunny doll and staring motionlessly in at them. After a while, I managed to get into their house. I stayed low, and snuck around, eating their pizza. Soon enough though, they found me. I retreated into a corner, under their stairs. And they locked me in. Kept me as their pet. I couldnt escape, i couldnt move, i couldnt run. But they fed me and talked to me, and I gave up hope on ever getting out. After a while they got bored and buggered off (they let me out after some persuasion though). After another hour of building my own ♥♥♥♥♥♥ yellow house, i returned to their house, and they welcomed me in this time. They let me use their toilet, watch tv, and partay all night. Some rocket launcher spammers came along but they were soon banned, and the partay carried on. At one point, they embedded me into some concrete like Han Solo in Star Wars. But they let me out eventually. They were cool people, and thats rare to find in a game. And then, some guy came along and told me to follow him. So i followed him, and he led me to his house. He told me to be a baby.  I was confused at first, but then he locked the doors, somehow shrunk me, and made me crawl around, typing baby noises in chat, and chilling in a crib he made. It was ♥♥♥♥ing scary. And i really couldnt escape. After a while he took me to town in his car. I could only crawl around the place, so i happily accepted the transport away from that guys creepy ♥♥♥ house. Now i just needed to lose this guy (without failing rp). The guy crashed the car, and i snuck off, claiming i was a scared and confused baby. Thats where everything went to ♥♥♥♥. I engaged operation 'Grand Theft Baby', stole a car, a gun, and as my baby self, i hit the road. This pedo guy tried looking for me with his jetpack, but i hit the hills and quietly disconected from the game.\n\nThis was one ♥♥♥♥ing server. I spent 4 hours on 1 ♥♥♥♥ing server having the creepiest yet most fun time of my life. Not to mention the fact that i went insane from the fact that the house i was stalking had some wierd radio playing a song about tacos on repeat. (at one point it glitched out and amplified like 100 times; my ears bled...)\n\nThis was ONE ♥♥♥♥ing server. There are other great servers, such as the battlefield-esque dogfighting server, or the knife TDM server. This game is absolutley incredible. Not to mention the incredible options for creativity and modding in single player (addons galore!), and the wonderful destruction physics!\n\nThis game is a must have if you like RP, multiplayer games in general and creative games. Its incredible fun, i played 9 ♥♥♥♥ing hours on my first day of owning it. I love Blockland, and though it may be dying player wise, its still one hell of a time!\n\nIts like Lego, Gmod and Roblox had a baby!\n\nOh yeah, and, for whatever ♥♥♥♥ing reason, you can get an achivment called 'gay pirate' for wearing a pink pirate hat. WTF!?\n\n10/10 IGN\n\nNo seriously, like 8/10 (its buggy, its dying, but as i said, its a hell of a time!)","April 5, 2015","true","23.5"," 535 of 606 people (88%) found this review helpful 571 people found this review funny","88","535","606","571","36"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaelanfrey/recommended/250340/","kaelanfrey","kaelan!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaelanfrey/","204 products in account","UPDATE 28-04-2014\n\nSo I haven't been very active within Blockland and only recently I've learned that Return to Blockland has been shutdown since February. Well, bugger. One of the biggest things on this review was RTB's existence.\n\nNot to worry! The community has already found ways to circumvent its shutdown and there are backup pages and a whole new chat addon thingy that imitates RTB's.\n\nBackups: http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=253292.0\nIRC Chat: http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=255973.0\n(I SERIOUSLY hope that Steam doesn't block the links any time soon. If it does, let me know and I'll fix it.)\n\nI haven't tested them and I don't have time to. But as far as I can tell, they all look pretty legit.\nBy the way, here's a cool FAQ I've found in case you have any questions: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=204838112\n\n//////////////////////////////////////\n\nThis game might sound cheesy for some people at first glance. "I mean gee, a game where you play with legos online? What is this, people never heard of how bad Roblox turned out to be?!" (Personally I like games where you build stuff very fun, that's why I bought Blockland years ago in the first place...)\n\nOh trust me, it's a lot more than that. This game is like a fusion between Garry's Mod and Legos, but FAR easier to play. You can do pretty much anything in a stylized block world - houses, cities, deathmatches, survival games, racing tracks - and a lot more with its intuitive building and eventing system. Eventing is a sort of very very easy "scripting" within Blockland that you can use to make certain blocks to do certain things from within pre-set lists of actions that you can do to the block for it to do something you want and a lot more. It might seem very overwhelming at first, but when you start playing with it you'll get used to the idea quickly.\n\nBuilding, in my opinion, is a little bit trickier, as you have to move "ghost blocks" around with the numpad (or some other buttons if you're on a numpad-less laptop) and then press enter to deploy a block, and they cannot be floating, nor penetrating the ground or other blocks, unless they are to be built within a Zone Brick which allows you to make actually floating blocks inside of it, so you don't have to make invisible supports for every floating island you might want to do. Buiilding is also very well optimized as you can do a number of moves with the ghost bricks to get them where you want and how you want quickly and efficiently; there exists a macro system where you can "save" the moves you do to a block so you can replicate patterns like stairs and stuff like that without much of a hassle. However, building can be clunky as you have to take blocks from a list to put them in your block selection list - you can only carry up to 10 blocks at a time, I believe.\n\nHowever don't let this limit your creativity, as you can do pretty superb buildings in this game as evidenced by the game's great community - there is lots of support for this game, the developers and its players won't hesitate to help you with any problems you might have with the product, and there are just a LOT of addons in this game that do not allow it to ever be boring, especially with the Return to Blockland addon which is basically a community hub for the game, complete with a chat room, news, and a ton of other addons that are mounted into RTB for easy access, deactivation and (un)installation. RTB can also be downloaded for your server so you can get new Administration features, get the addons of your server listed in the server browser, so the players don't have to download it directly from your server (given they're hosted in RTB), and a few more features.\n\nWARNING: Read the update above first. RTB is no longer functional, but there are backups.\n\nMaking addons for this game is, from what I understand, not tremendously difficult, and as long as you have the talent and willpower to make that one brick you can't find but need, or to make that weapon of your dreams, have a Ferrari in your garage or just a simple addition like a new face for your Blockhead, or maybe a song you want your Music Brick to play, all in all there is no (?) limit to the addons you can make for the game. I wish I could write from experience, but unfortunately, apart from a song or two I didn't make any addons for this game.\n\nWhat I WAS ABLE TO do however was host servers and oh boy, coming from a person who can't ever host servers because of his connection not ever letting people connect, this was a HUGE plus for me. Even the player with the most blocked-off router can host games for their friends and never be hindered by issues like tremendous lag or timeouts, in my experience I found the netcode of Blockland to be very good. At least... I think this is the netcode's doing.\n\nThe gameplay is very appealing and so are the graphics, as they are very beautiful and, unsurprisingly, very colourful, stylized to look like a cartoon, similar to the likes of TF2, except on legos. Yeah. Graphics for me are very hard to describe. The "maps" (or just... plains) are roughly customizable so they have bodies of water or different types of surfaces, which can spice up the game a bit - I've always liked to build in maps with lots of water.\n\nOverall, the game is very enjoyable and on the right servers it can be a ludicrous amount of fun. It is really amazing how such a simple and cheap game like this can provide so many hours of entertainment, from messing around with a few people to doing giant, elaborate buildings, from having mindless fast-paced deathmatch to having class-based capture the flag matches on carefully structured builds and just so much more. Blockland is truly a game for the ages, despite a few flaws like clunky building and some instances of lag when there are too many bricks within a server or when they're being duplicated.\n\nI have this game since V12 and now it's on what, Vtwenty-something or so, and from there and now I still recommend it to everybody, kids to adults. The only thing I DIDN'T like is how they got rid of maps in an update months back. Back then you had maps like Bedroom and Kitchen, that were... well, semi-realistic bedrooms and kitchens. I REALLY liked those! But hey, they needed to take a radical action to let the game evolute and that was the end result I suppose...\n\nTL;DR: This game is great! Totally recommended! A bit clunky to get started, but you'll get used to it! Lots of addons to help you, client-side and server-side! The graphics are also beautiful!","December 16, 2013","true","15.6"," 1,325 of 1,601 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","325","1","0","97"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cxero/recommended/250340/","cxero","Sgt. Tactifag","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cxero/","76 products in account","I love this game but I absolutely cannot recomend it.\n\nDon't get the "not recomended" wrong - this IS a good game. A few years ago I'd definitely have recomended it, but now it's dying. Blockland is a game where 90% of the content is produced by the users in the form of mods. Badspot, for most of Blockland's history, actually helped these modders by modifying the game engine to better suit their creativity. This helped keep the tiny community alive. A service called RTB was released by a game modder called Ephialtes* - it had a friends list, private chat messages, IRC, and allowed people to download mods directly to the game. This is probably the main reason Blockland had any form of community at all.\n\nThis has changed. Badspot released an update that would remove maps and replaced them with slightly improved graphics. Seems to make sense, since you can just build everything with bricks, right? In actuality, the brick limit is atrociously low** - on the other hand, terrain could be set to loop indefinitely. We were able to get around this by making the terrain on maps and building on top of the terrain. Now, terrain can only be done by one of two methods:\n1. Building it with bricks\n2. Modular Terrain\n\nOption #1 leaves vehicles entierely out of the question, because the vehicle physics are atrocious - they are guaranteed to get stuck over and over again, and there's little to no smooth slopes because bricks are boxy. You CAN make brick terrain look good, but it takes an insane amount of bricks and you'll likely hit the brick limit. You can phase right through a brick if you're going fast enough in a vehicle.\nMap Terrain vs Brick Terrain: http://i43.tinypic.com/2rc1ulh.png\n\nOption #2 is modular terrain, which is bricks that have smooth ramps. Slightly better, but it's ugly as sin and still contrained by the brick limit. You can also phase right through it if you're going fast enough in a vehicle.\nModular Terrain: http://pixpipeline.com/s/eaf878362c19.jpg\n\nBadspot will NOT fix many of the issues, most notably the ones above. The modding community has practically pushed the game to its limit. Badspot prefers to argue instead of fixing issues. Many of the good people have been driven away. The community has been stripped to a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ weaboos who crack at least one 9/11 or holocaust joke every two minutes. There's many other problems with this game, but this is how calm criticism is handled at Blockland: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54466069/banned.png\n\nLastly, and most importantly, Badspot is simply unprofessional -- he accuses the people who don't like the game's development path of being "entitled" - but if anything, Badspot is entitled. These veterans produce most of the game's content in the form of gameplay. They host the game's servers for free. They are where all of the content comes from, and Badspot refuses to update the game to better suit their creative impulses. Blockland would never get anywhere without them.\n\nMany major Blockland people have plain left due to these problems. People such as Ephialtes and Kalphiter. This game is great - but now, it's dying.\n\nI wish Badspot or really anyone would make some kind of sequel and start all over again and get around the development problems -- I would buy that straight away, and I'm sure the vast majority of the community would too.\n\nDo I recomend this game? Unfortunately, I simply can't.\n\n*I'm talking about the new RTB, not the original v0002 one. Yes, I know it's technically been around for years but the old RTB has little in common with the current one.\n**Although the brick limit was raised, it is still atrociously low if you want to have a massive terrain map.","January 18, 2015","false","484.9"," 496 of 611 people (81%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","81","496","611","33","39"

Blockland isn't a lego universe full of fun things to do and intresting people to meet. This game is a trap. I have been playing it since it's earliest days (I was literally one of the first hundred people to buy this game). It was fun at the start when there was still clans and builds and gamemodes were still new and exciting. But it hasn't risen with the times.\n\nNothing new has really been made since 2010. It WAS a very fun game to play, when there was still new things being made and that could be discovered. But nothing like that has happened for this game in a very long time. And with years the community deteroriated to become what it now is today. And the patehtic community of this game only more so worsens it's already near-broken state.\n\nBlockland is only kept up and running so Eric can leach more money off it. Little has he done to update it or improve it in any way for a long time. And guess what, he doesn't care. He's literally said multiple times that the only reason he is still giving Blockland even a fraction of his time or effort is because it makes him too much money for him to stop. And when I say a fraction... I truly mean even less than that. He has done nothing and put virtually no effort into improving the game or updating it in any way that the players or the community would appreciate.\n\nThe game is NOTHING like it is in the trailer. Sure a lot of that stuff shown in the trailer is possible but I can personally garuntee that not a single server being hosted at this time has anything even close to that exciting or unique.\n\nThe community for this game is virtually nonexistant (unless you're dying to be in a commuinty full of autocratic ♥♥♥♥♥). I have not seen a gaming community full of more hostile and irrational people in my life. This is why all of our servers have nothing good.\n\nPeople on the forums site are pathetic. They do absolutely nothing to upkeep the game or make it better in any way, and spend virtually all of their time ranting on about how the community sucks and making drama threads pointing fingers at users when in reality EVERYONE on the site is doing the exact same thing for the game: NOTHING. Which is why it sucks! :)\n\n\nNo, you won't be doing anything like what's in that trailer. Hate to break it to you. Unless you want to spend days learning how to make all of those things yourself and submerge yourself in a community full up stuck up arrogant ♥♥♥♥♥♥, don't buy this game.\n\nTo the insightful developer comment I recieved below: (This was ORIGINALLY his response, before he changed it to what it is now)\n\nBadspot:"So we're looking at a negative review of the Blockland community from someone who aimbots in counter-strike. Nice. Blockland: Generally disliked by cheaters."\n\nLast played Counter-Strike: Source: Apr 24, 2011 11:14am\n1 VAC ban(s) on record	 | Info\n88 day(s) since last ban\n\nNice. But, I think not. Recieved the VAC ban from being KL'd, and you can't appeal them. However, I do like how when responding to negative reviews of your product you deviate from actaully addressing ANY of the problems users mention about your game and instead try pinpoint things you find wrong with them to use as leverage against everything that is wrong with YOUR game and how YOU are chosing to manage it. Though it doesn't suprise me in regards to how I have seen you manage our community over the years.\n\nYou want to talk about professionality? Rather you would search for dirt on people who write bad reviews of Blockland instead of actually addressing any of the problems that are wrong with your game? I suppose you would, and not really suprisingly... :/\n\nhttp://prntscr.com/2qsz4o\n\nAbove is an example of this games professional developer banning a user from his forums for asking when the game will be updated again. This is his professional ban message he leaves them with: "Get ♥♥♥♥ed, I don't owe you anything."\n\n----\nEDIT:\nBasically in his other comments he's made in my review (besides the response he left at the bottom of my review) he complains that the things that I say are bad about this game he cannot fix, and that I don't complain about enough; or really any architectural features about the game itself. Honestly the community for this game is so hostile and disfunctional (which is what this review tried to originally describe) and when you put that on top of the fact that the game has not been updated in over a year and is managed very poorly I personally have come to the conclusion that this game is not worth spending your time and money on. That is the point I was trying to make.\n\nTo talk about the actual gameplay of this game and it's features:\nThe game features a menu where you can select what brick you want and place it ontop of another brick, to build virtually whatever you want. This, along with a minigame creator where you can choose to spawn with weapons and start a deathmatch with other players. Now that there isn't maps anymore I have basically listed all of the features of this game.\n\nThere has been ONE new / neat thing that was added into the game since the games actual realse by the developer himself . And this was actually really pretty cool (when it came out in 2010) where you can "wrench" bricks to name them, spawn weapons on them and (the new part) "event" them to where you can setup conditional events to make them check for / do certian things (like explode, play a sound, emit an particle, ect.) when you activate them (or when something does). Other than this however (and keep in mind this came out in 2010) there has been nothing new that has been added into the game through an update in the complete history of this games existance. (besides the removal of maps and addition of very poorly optimized shaders - which was hardly an update, if you ask anyone in the community)\n\nCAN you build things in this game? Sure you can! I've built castles, houses, all that stuff... But it takes a lot of time to learn how. It's not easy to do. And you're not going to be getting help along the way, as the hostile commuinty doesn't put up with people who have questions, or can't manage things on their own. So if you want to, yes you can - but you're going to have to learn all by yourself and it takes a lot of time before you will get to making anything even half as spectacular as what's shown in the trailer. It's just really a lot more complicated and a lot less convenient than he makes it out to be.\n\nAfter playing the game and building things in it for seven years the way he is advertising it (quite frankly) seems like some sort of trick - atleast to me. The game doesn't have all that stuff in it currently and all of that would be extremely hard to make on your own. There arent't currently servers like that ready where all of that stuff you saw in that trailer will be waiting for you.\n\nYou CAN make all of those things that are in the trailer, to be fair. However, just no one really does. So to put it clearly, I just don't get the point. Why show a trailer of your game that is not like your game at all / full of things that aren't currently in your game?\n\nTO CONCLUDE: The gameplay of this game is NOT bad. It is just a game that hasn't been updated in forever, and is managed very poorly. If you are looking for a game with a future, that has planned updates, friendly technical support or that has a community full of users that you will enjoy to play the game with, DONT buy this game - because well, it has none of these things.","June 15, 2014","false","0.2"," 1,434 of 1,872 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","434","1","2","312"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kalphiter/recommended/250340/","Kalphiter","Kalphiter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kalphiter/","5 products in account","The developer has finally admitted that he has stopped all development[forum.blockland.us] on the game, as if it hadn't been already obvious considering the lack of updates in the past ten months, the half-broken Steam version of the game (broken for a year already), and the extremely low quality and quantity of the updates before then. He has resorted to censoring and banning people who criticize the game's development[blocklandcloud.com], so this should be an obvious sign that the game is done for. When or if you buy this abandoned game, consider the fact that this disrespectful, uncaring and greedy "developer" will be getting your money.\n\n========\n\nResponse to developer response (10 August 2014):\n\n\n++++++++++\n(original developer response)\n\n"Hey everyone, right now Blockland is available in the Reboot 6.0 bundle from BundleStars: http://www.bundlestars.com/all-bundles/reboot-bundle-6/\n\n6 great Steam games (including Blockland!) for only $2.99!\n\nWhy not pick it up, play Blockland for 5 years, then leave a negative Steam review?\nSee you back here in 2019!"\n++++++++++\n\nHow nice of you to finally respond to one of the most thorough and drama-free reviews once it reached the front page! Oh wait, that's not really a response... it's a sales promotion. A sales promotion is definitely a valid response to everything I've already written here!\n\nBelieve it or not, it is quite possible to love the art but hate the artist. As a modder myself, I've dealt with years of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t when it came to supporting modders and their needs. I had been running a hosting service for quite some time until the day I left, which is one of the biggest reasons I stayed so long. Unfortunately, you decided to take a "♥♥♥♥ it" approach when it came to supporting server hosting services (and modders), so now the game's largest two hosting services are gone and the community is left with almost nothing. You have banned users from your forum for criticizing the game, so once I finally had enough of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I left the game. Since you have no power here to permanently delete people's opinions, which you do at your own forum (evidence of this is in the very next segment of this review), this was the perfect chance to finally speak my mind without fearing all the possible consequences with which you could punish me. Considering that this review is now the top review, I think it's reasonable to say that people have had enough of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, too.\n\nIt's not like I suddenly started hating the game. While I was still a part of the community, I felt as if I couldn't speak my mind since you punish everyone who criticizes it. I was able to realize my power to reach out to people once I was free from your reigns, so I exerted that power. This isn't some campaign of revenge: it's years of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t finally brought to light.\n\n========\n\nUpdate (6 August 2014):\n\nThe owner of the game (Badspot) has silently banned "Heedicalking" from the game's official forum. Heedicalking is an important person in terms of the servers he hosted and his contributions to the community. Heedicalking often talks about the lack of game development on the forum in the most mature way possible. Development has in fact been lacking recently: in fact, there hasn't been a major update in the last 2 years. Many people were expecting him to be banned for simply criticizing the game's development, and voilà, he has finally been banned. The owner of the game is getting extremely defensive towards anyone who dares talk about the game's lack of development.\n\n\nFor reference, here are relevant links pertaining to the post removals:\n\nhttp://blocklandcloud.com/heed/\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54466069/banned.png\n\n========\n\n\nUpdate (27 June 2014):\n\nThe owner of the game (Badspot) has banned LewnaJa and me from Blockland's Steam community. He also deleted the entire thread in which he had our responses. The thread (the poster was most likely not the victim) was pointing out how a ban was unfair. The same ban image also happened to be mentioned in an earlier review from February: http://steamcommunity.com//profiles/76561198044732390/recommended/250340/\n\nHere is copy of thread: http://blocklandcloud.com/20140626-blockland-steam-removed-thread/\n\nThe ban reasons for us are the same and the posts cited for our bans were each of our first ones in that thread. This is LewnaJa's ban:\nhttp://imgur.com/a/oX0ex\n\nThe owner has taken similar action towards LewnaJa when he initially posted his negative review and found himself banned from the game's official forum (not Steam's forum provided for the game).\n\nMake your own conclusions about why the owner of the game felt so obliged to ban us. Today, the negative reviews have been piling up on the store page to the point where 3 of the 5 shown-to-everyone-by-default reviews were negative and it still remains that way. Fortunately he does not have the power to remove any reviews at all. It must be embarrassing for Badspot to have what is pretty much the front page for his game be covered in negativity.\n\n========\n\nOriginal review:\n\nI have played this game for more than 5 years (not on Steam) and I am disappointed at how quickly it has declined. Don't be fooled into buying this game just because it looks great. The developers (developer) have abandoned the game. Check out my long elaboration on why I think the game is practically abandoned:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BlocklandIsHorrible/comments/267v7h/badspot_is_no_longer_doing_his_fair_share_of_work/\n\nThe game hasn't had a major update for 2 years and any update for 6 months. The game's most important people have been angry about the developer's ("Badspot") reluctance to maintain the game's development. Check out this satirical comic which illustrates the developer's greed: http://brockrandcomics.tumblr.com/post/92596058472/filipe-7-22-14\n\nCLARIFICATION FOR BELOW PARAGRAPH: server hosting issues do not include those who have bought the game in the classical way and duplicated their purchases to their Steam accounts, because they can still run the game the classical way. The below paragraph applies to those who have exclusively bought the game from Steam and not on the Blockland website.\n\nIf you buy Blockland through Steam, you will have a lot of trouble hosting a server. Although there is technically a way to host a server by modifying the program's arguments, you can't play the game at the same time. Want someone else to circumvent these restrictions by hosting a server for you under your name? Too bad; hosting services cannot be used by people who bought the game through Steam. The developers have neglected Steam users and deprived them of server hosting for over 6 months. I think it's clear that they do not care anymore and are only trying to make a quick buck out of what the game has left.\n\n(THIS HAS BEEN AN OUTSTANDING ISSUE FOR OVER A YEAR)\n\n\n\n\nSome of you legacy players may find these statistics about the game's decline interesting: http://blocklandcloud.com/","June 19, 2014","false","0.2"," 592 of 758 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","592","758","0","171"

There you will find my recommendation. Thank you!]\n\nSo this game has been one of my favorite building games of all time. Starting in 2010 along with the majority of what I would say was our community, I bought the original Blockland and was having a great time. Things were getting done, updates being made. There were these classics maps I'll never forget: the Bedroom, the Kitchen, and the Slopes. I enjoyed this game, and I was estimated to be playing it about 10 hours a day or more. (Update: Many people don't believe I played this game as long as I claim. The truth is, Blockland existed before (its release on) Steam. For this reason, Steam has not registered all my hours from when I played it before. I only recently migrated to Steam Blockland from the original Vanilla Blockland. Hope that clears things up!)\n\nIt took some time but an insightful man by the name of Ephialtes in-game decided to build Blockland a new system. I believe it was around 2011-2012 that this became widely-used. It was called Return to Blockland, and was basically the Steam client for Blockland before Blockland was actually on Steam. It had a 'Workshop' (servers that hosted add-ons you could directly download from), Add-On Manager, Friends client, global IRC chat, chat rooms, easy-to-use settings system for your server, add-on preferences manager, and so much more. It was the true revelation of Blockland's existence. It brought upon a new experience for the Blockland community, and gave it a modern feel.\n\nThen this game went on Greenlight.\n\nThat officially marked the downfall of RTB, which would eventually be shut down because Steam replaced 1/3 of its functionality. There would no longer be a place to manage your add-ons, chat globally with other BL users, find your friends (since they would no longer be on RTB and you didn't know if they had Steam), and last but not least, you could no longer manage your server like you used to.\n\nThat probably drove me away the most. I stuck around for a bit, hosted a multitude of mildly popular servers as well as a 32/32 player MERP server that consisted of most of my time. After about four months, I kinda lost interest and began the process of leaving the BL community. I left a legacy, but even that would soon be forgotten...\n\nSo you know that game called Minecraft? I ended up spending almost all of my time on that. I hosted some very popular servers on Minecraft, met some great friends, and was enjoying it. I almost forgot about Blockland completely, but then my friend (who shall remain nameless) decided to get Blockland after I showed him a fun little gamemode on it called Renderman. He got it, and when I saw that he did, I decided to hop back on and play with him... but I didn't do much otherwise.\n\nI truly came back about two months ago. I began hosting my MERP server, probably just to feel the nostalgia and see all the empires that had been built on it. A friend of mine by the name of Amir (a full-time player of my server back when it was popular) happened to stop by. We had an awesome reunion, played a bit of MERP (not really. Just remarked on how sucky our builds were), had a lot of fun. I began playing Blockland much more.\n\nAnd then I stopped. Garry's Mod took up my time. I managed a community on there and couldn't depart from them. But that wasn't the only reason.\n\nI lost interest.\n\nSo anyways, if you got to the bottom of this review reading through an incredibly long backstory and wondering why the heck I'd write a story like that, I congratulate you. You have the patience of a... you, but none of this was really a review, was it?\n\nSo here's my take on the game.\n\nIf you want to play a game with a large amount of active community supporters/respectful, mature players, don't get this game.\n\nIf you want to play a game where you build anything and can do anything (with the help of a bit of programming knowledge or the visually-based event system), get this game.\n\nIf you want to play a game where servers are always full and there is an easy way to liven up your game with user-created add-ons, don't get this game.\n\nIf you want to play a game where you can host a server of any kind, have some fun with Pirate Ship DM gamemodes, and basically shoot your friends with laser pistols and horse rays (yeah, they turn them into a horse), this game IS FOR YOU.\n\nBUT. If you want a game that will keep you interested for years to come, always ready for that next update, always ready for that next big thing... don't get this game. It's unkempt, uncombed, and unfathomably stagnate.\n\nBut I might be wrong. What if YOU are the next big thing?\n\nIn my opinion, this game is NOT recommended due to the lack of interesting things that may be found in Blockland. It's a great game, don't get me wrong, but it is running on steam (get it hahahahaaha... haha. ..ha... sorry) and no longer has that spark of a game that has true potential. Maybe Badspot can turn this around one day. And maybe you can be a part of that. Me, on the other hand, have exhausted the game of Blockland. I like the game, but I can no longer play it.\n\nMaybe it'll be different for you.","October 9, 2014","false","42.0"," 1,040 of 1,393 people (75%) found this review helpful 122 people found this review funny","75","040","1","122","77"

I played ROBLOX when I got my computer back in 2010. Was ROBLOX awful? Yes. They turned a simple lego creativity game into a pay to play kind of game. Blockland, however, is not. Blockland uses all of the elements that ROBLOX has and multiplies the options by ten, with more controls, bricks, and ways to play. If you were to buy a Garry's Mod lego set, that would be Blockland. Lots of servers to choose from, many gamemodes (Even custom ones!), a community that is suprisingly adult-aged, and hours of fun. I would recommend this to anyone who loves LEGO's and Garry's Mod.","January 31, 2014","true","855.3"," 409 of 560 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","409","560","0","40"

The gameplay makes it a lot like Gmod, except with a more consistant style. Additionally, it's multiplayer architecture makes joining servers with custom content seamless. You'll literally never need to actually install an add-on to play on a server with custom content (with a few exceptions, servers using custom GUI's may want you to install their GUI mods in order to play. This is usually optional anyways.)\n\nThe gamemode system adds a lot more 'out of the box' fun things to do than the game used to have. But it's still a bit underwhelming and you'll probably only get about a few hours of fun out of it if you refuse to install any add-on gamemodes or other things. Other than a few gamemodes available that are designed to be played in single-player, multiplayer is really where everything is at. There are a number of servers that have been developed for literally years and have a very high quality experience. If you ever really enjoyed Gmod at all, you'll probably find that the most fun servers in Blockland are ones where someone has simply set out a blank slate and a bunch of really neat mods. Shenanigans ensue.\n\nIt's a game you'll just keep coming back to.","December 16, 2013","true","540.4"," 264 of 357 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","264","357","0","0"

Literally a blank canvas.\n\nI've played this game since it was in vers. 8. I had the time of my life playing on all the deathmatch and freebuild servers and whatnot.\n\nWhen I discovered addons and mods, I was amazed. People made all sorts of new vehicles, bricks, weapons etc. for the game. I decided I'd download some and try them out.\n\nThe one addon/mod I really enjoyed was Gamemode_Zombie. It was a L4D-style addon with all the zombie types (boomer, hunter, etc.) There was even a subway map made for it.\n\nNow, there was this sort of client within the game called Return to Blockland (RTB). It included a friends list and an addon manager and even a public chat thing where you could talk to anyone that had RTB. It was overall just a neat way to chat with friends and find new addons.\n\nBut the game has taken a turn for the worse, I am afraid. Not too long ago, RTB was shut down. The friend system was no longer available and the mod downloader/manager was shut down as well. It was much harder to contact friends and see what addons were installed on your game. This made many people upset and the game just sort of died.\n\nThe game itself, though, had a decent amount of content. There were maps such as Kitchen, The Slopes, and Bedroom that you could explore. Now, these maps weren't made of bricks so that's what made them unique.\n\nThe V21 update changed this. Maps were replaced by nicer graphics and better shaders,\nand to make up for the loss of maps we were given an empty slate to build on. The ground and skybox were, or /are/ customizeable with different textures and whatnot.\n\nThe loss of RTB and the maps has just led to the downfall of this game. The community has turned in to some sort of mix of a Tumblr/♥♥♥♥♥ drama-fest full of feels and oppression where everyone thinks they can flame and argue with each other to solve their problems.\n\nI haven't played this game for about 2-3 months because there just isn't anything new or exciting to see and do and, as i stated in the previous paragraph, the community is just downright bad. The servers are low-quality with 99.9% of them being horrid Five Nights at Freddy's RPs and that last .1% being an actual good server with decent admins and choice of addons. (which honestly is hard to find, you should be happy if you actually manage to find or make one.)\n\nI can't exactly recommend this game. Once it gets better (which it clearly never will), then maybe I'll change my review.\n\nmaybe.\n\nI give this game a 3/10.\n\nTL;DR\n------\n\n-The game was good up until v21.\n\n-Maps were awesome and now we just have a blank slate.\n\n-There was a good community with a good amount of content.\n\n-RTB closed down and everything went bad, especially the community.\n\n-FNAF fanboys.\n\n-tumblr party\n\n-RIP, Blockland.\n\n-3/10\n\nsorry for the novel of a review.","May 3, 2015","false","197.0"," 318 of 465 people (68%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","68","318","465","38","38"

I had a one month membership on this game, and I played it non-stop (most likely over 200 hours total) for the short time I had it. After I ran out of the membership, I went to Roblox (bad idea, big war going on between Blockland and Roblox at that time). After I quit Roblox, I went to Minecraft. Then I (semi)quit Minecraft and went to Steam. After about two years on Steam, I found this game. I had wonderful flashbacks of how me and my cousin would destroy everything, and build it again, then destroy it, again and again and again.

I am posting this update because he is ignoring my emails, making him even more suspicious.\n\nEdit of March 11th, in response to the developer's desperate attempt at defending himself after making himself look like a clown:\n\nBefore judging me as a person, please read how the users of Blockland reacted to a disliked user's house being burned down and his cat being killed: http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=181239.0\n\nPlease ignore the developer's response for now. If you want to know why he is resorting to such low tactics to defend himself, I insist that you read all of the comments below on all pages. I will address the developer's response directly from the comments in order to save space on this review and to prevent people from reading my life story when the review is about Blockland.\n\nEdit of March 6th, in response to the developer editing his response in effort to work around his original comment's deletion which was intended to harass me:\n\nEric Hartman (Badspot), has a history of being childish in the way he handles things. He has let children upset him to the point of exposing their personal information and families' information over the internet in an effort to have his community harass them in his defense.\n\nWhile there is only one case that I know of where this has occurred, it is unacceptable and is a violation of that person's privacy rights. Badspot revealed the payment names and email addresses of this user which, I'm pretty sure, is against the law.\n\nHere is the "Drama Dossier" on a user who has made the mistake of upsetting Badspot: http://badspot.us/Zac-Conover.html\n\nALL of his communication data which was collected by Badspot through SECURE PAYMENTS and was trusted to him, a man selling his product. How can you explain that? You give a man selling a legitimate product your money and he exposes the information you used on his website because you angered him. Does that sound professional to you? I think not.\n\nThe question you should be asking yourselves is: Do you want to end up like this guy? If you bother Badspot enough, he'll do the same to you. I have hardly done anything worth being called out for because this man has ignored my existence until the very moment I called him out on the one place he still has a chance to milk money from users with a game he doesn't even take care of.\n\n-Edit of February 25th, removed for updated data-\n\n---- Original Review ----\n\nI'll be the first to write a somewhat negative review about this game:\n\nFirst: I started playing this game around 2006-07, prior to Retail Blockland's (the current game) release. This game is almost entirely community-based. This game is what you want to make it, which means the community needs responsible, creative users to help form a fun game for everyone.\n\nThis has been a problem since the recent removal of maps, which were an easy way to play the game without putting too much effort into it. Currently, the game has a lack of creative players which have caused many, many players to quit the game due to the lack of content from the developer (which he removed maps with a promise of more content, which never came, even a year later), and the lack of decent servers to play on.\n\nHowever, Blockland has always had the problem of a small community which has made decent servers scarce. The lack of maps has left mapmakers without their ability to contribute to Blockland, causing them to leave along with many other players who enjoyed playing on maps rather than the default (and now, the only) map, "Slate".\n\nI'm not going to lie. I, and many others have felt that the game has been dead (or dying) for a long time now. Even when maps were still here, the game was dying slowly, but surely -- the removal of the maps just kickstarted it because nobody knew how to cope with the lack of creative builders to replace the position that maps once held.\n\nSteam, for some of us, is believed to be the last resort for Blockland's future. It's up to you, the newest purchaser who is reading this review, to help reform the community into something better, more active, and more stable.\n\nAnother problem is that since the maps were removed, many players with low-spec computers were forced to quit due to being unable to process the amount of bricks it would take to create a "map".\n\nSo, if you've got a low-spec PC, I would not recommend this game to you until you get a computer with a decent processor and graphics card. Otherwise, you'll be playing with a constant lag that will drive you to hate the game.\n\nThe shaders are poorly optimized. (And I mean, they are *extremely* poorly optimized.) So the majority of the Blockland community don't even play with the shaders that we sacrificed our maps for because they can't even run them. Not even high-spec computers can run the shaders with a large amount of bricks unless you've got a ridiculously powerful computer. I've got a quad-core i5 processor and an AMD 7870 Graphics card, 2GB video memory, and I can run Battlefield 3 on max settings with over 60FPS, whereas I have trouble running shaders on max in Blockland and end up only getting around 28-30FPS with builds that are around 50k bricks or more.\n\nThe gameplay is good as long as you play on a decent server, it depends on your tastes.\n\nI'm also going to warn anyone who buys this game: Prepare to be flamed, trolled, or annoyed by the community at some point. The game has one of the most merciless, rude, arrogant communities I have ever been a part of. However, that's not the majority of the community. A lot of the community is very nice and like to take part with each other in building projects or film-making and such. But if you ask me, the community needs an increase in better players.\n\nTo conclude, we have a lack of a decent, creative playerbase right now and we need more players with more creativity and will to step forward and create something awesome out of this game. Everything in the trailer IS possible, but most of it has never happened and will never happen unless we have more creative players. The trailer was highly exaggerated and the game is far more boring than that. But like I said, everything in the trailer is possible, but it hasn't happened -- yet.\n\nSo, if you're willing to be a good player and you want to help revive an almost-dead game and form it into a better game for everyone's enjoyment, buy the game. If you don't want to work with the community, hate playing games that take time and effort to make something good out of it, or just generally dislike overhyped games, don't buy it. Even though the game is overexaggerated, it doesn't mean we can't work together to make it that awesome.\n\nIt's up to you.","December 16, 2013","false","225.7"," 828 of 1,278 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","828","1","0","484"

There's also the fact that the blocks that can be used to build are practically LEGO Blocks, which means that even building simple square houses is a tedious process.

I have put about 5 months into this game outside of steam, and I still love it.  I feel like I can get more out of it the more I play it.\n\nI am going to address most of the things the negative reviews are saying about this game.\n\n1.  Minecraft is better\n\nIn this game it is hard to build things that look good, but you can make things in much greater detail than in minecraft.  The building in this game is superior to minecraft's building.  You can build things with dozens of different bricks (not including brick mods) unlike minecraft that just has a standard block with different textures and a few other detail blocks like fences.  Minecraft has a terrible combat system that makes it awful for mini games.  This game has amazing combat elements.  You can do anything in this game in minecraft, but not nearly as well or easily.  Minecraft combat and minigames feel cheap and not very well put together.  I personally hate minecraft, but that does not make it a bad game.     It is a good survival sandbox game, but it ends there.  Anything above that can be done better in so many other games.\n\n2.  The developer is awful\n\nWho cares, you are buying the game not the developer.  If you are not on the forums and arn't stealing anyones keys or doing something that would get you banned from any other multiplayer game on steam, you will be fine.  I have never had a problem with the developer at any time.\n\n3.  The community is awful\n\nI really have not noticed this outside of the forums, and even so, it is mostly the drama section of the forums that is awful.  It depends on the server you go on of course, but the whole community is not awful.  The bad community in this game consists of the ones that keep complaining about how terrible the developer and community is.  I don't see them doing anything to make it better, they just tick off the developer with their constant complaining which I find makes me angry as well.  I don't even deal with a hundreth as much as the developer does, so excuse him for for being cranky sometimes.\n\nIf you look for terrible people in a community you will find terrible people in a community.  If you look for awesome people in a community you will find awesome people in a community.\n\n4.  Not enough content/game is dying\n\nNot true.  Since this game has been on steam only over a year at the time of this review, the community has more than trippled.  Dying? ok sure.  More people means more mods and servers.  Mods are so easy to install in this game, and it is the only game that I do not find it to be a hassel to do so.  People have modded the game so heavily that it does not even feel like the same game anymore.  This game is fairly dependant on mods, but it has some VERY good mods.\n\n5.  Terrain/interriors replaced with shaders and it ruined the game\n\nTerrain and interriors were not all that great.  Like really they were ok for a few servers, but I only used the flat maps and built my own terrain.  They simply were not easy to build on in many cases which happens to be one of the main points of the game.  The shadows and shaders look amazing and are also moddable.  Even if you cannot run them, it does not take away from the game.  There is an environment editing GUI that allows you to edit the lighting, weather, fog, ground texture/color, water level, and other things.  One of the most used maps before the removal of terrain was adjustable plate which was the same thing as the environment edit GUI but not as good.\n\nAnd finally...\n\nThis game is great if you put the time in to learn it and have friends to play with.  Most of the time I have put into this game I have played without friends, so they are not required to have fun.  There are times when there are not many interesting servers to join, but even then you can just host your own.  Don't listen to those complaining about the community and the dev.  If you like building and or a casual FPS I would highly recommend this game.  There have been times when I did not build for months playing this game, and I just enjoyed the fighting/shooter servers.","February 1, 2015","true","571.1"," 48 of 67 people (72%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","72","48","67","6","6"

It's not like Roblox either (Ah the famous Blockland vs Roblox wars...) because of the more solid platform and no subscription. So what is this then? Good question. I think Badspot, the creator of the game, can sum it up quite nicely:\n\n"Blockland is an online multiplayer game where you build things with bricks.\nIt's like playing with legos on the internet."\n\nIn my mind, Blockland is one of the best construction/building sandbox games ever made. It is one of my personal favorites that I've played since 2007. I probably have over 600 hours ingame. (Not including Steam) You can do just about anything in this game, from FPS Team Deathmatches to racing to <variable>. Blockland is quite fun by itself, but the real reason you get it is for the high modability. Thousands of community creations keep the game interesting, and populated. Vehicles, weapons, gamemodes, scripts, events, this game has it all for customization. While singleplayer lets you experiment and test, multiplayer is where most people will choose to spend their time. There is always a server up for a specific type of play. (And they usually have good admins)\n\nThere is one part where Blockland has an issue...\n\nThe community is not amazing. (Most of the modders are amazing though) If you go on the official forums you will most likely see tons of hate/spam/garbage/negativity. The moderators do a good job of clearing out the useless and hurtful stuff, but I feel as if its always been like this. If you are like me, you really don't let it get to you; but I can see how it might be unacceptable to others.\n\nOther than this (really) small issue, I completely and fully recommend Blockland to anybody that is even slightly interested in sandbox games or being creative.\n\n10/10","October 27, 2014","true","179.1"," 112 of 183 people (61%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","61","112","183","8","0"

Basically, I grew up with this game. I met some good friends in the community. It was good. I'm not sure up until now since the new visual features were added, but still a good game in its core. I've spent a ♥♥♥♥♥on of hours on this game ever since. Now, I think I've grown up from this game, but I think new people can appreciate it as well.\n\nRTB (Return to Blockland) was game's greatest community mod API ever. Unfortunately, it was shut down by its creator Ephialtes, due to a majority of its functionality was overrun by Steam's community tools. It's sad, because a majority of good, curated add-ons were on its database. I just hope Badspot (the developer) finds a way to introduce the Steam Workshop to Blockland in order to compensate this.\n\nThe downside to add-ons recently is that all add-ons are not curated anymore, just scanned for malicious or too-crappy code/content. Nonetheless, some high quality add-ons still exist in the community forums.\n\nDisclaimer though,A high percentage of the community is difficult to manage with (considering most are kids at the moment). This can be avoided if you have a lot of patience in communicating with children.\n\nAgain, due to the most of the community being children, banning was a common act of the developer. There were as well, older people who are apparently trolls who love to spark the fire in the community. Some are it for fun, while some are it for revenge. This is the reason why some people are angry at the developer for cleansing the community of many people.\n\nOnly a fraction are those excellent to play with and communicate with.

It's YOUR world with YOUR own rules.","November 1, 2014","true","267.0"," 145 of 246 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","145","246","4","0"

However, I got it pretty recently (within the past 3 months) and I think it's pretty good. The building and overall gameplay took me a while to get used to it, but it plays fairly easily after that. The building system is a bit annoying, but you get used to it. The game modes are pretty good, but most of them are optimized for multiplayer. Speaking of multiplayer, the overall amount of servers and activity is decent. There are a lot of servers with varying game modes. The community seems OK from what I've seen on the forums, so no complaint there. However, I wish this game had Workshop support and more updates. Even though there is no Workshop, mods are pretty easy to download, but since Return to Blockland was discontinued they are a bit harder to get to work. Overall, I'd recommend it with a 7.5/10","November 11, 2014","true","16.7"," 58 of 92 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","58","92","5","0"

Just because RTB's service was shutdown, it does NOT mean the game is ruined. You can still get addons off of mirrors, and some addons even have a new IRC/addons manager. You can even still use the old RTB client for managing your addons as well, just not downloading them.\n\n2. Badspot is not saying the community is the problem. He is saying that it is a specific age group, and he can not control all of them. They host their own servers, with their own rules. Don't get mad if one of them happens to ban you for acting annoying to them or others, or you don't read their rules.\n\n3. When you think of the community, you're probably thinking of the forums. Let me just say, that you're probably browsing the Off-Topic section and just saying that's not normal. Please note, you are looking in the OFF-TOPIC section. Most Blockland related things are in the Blockland, Files, and Modification Help sections.\n\nAlright, now to the review.\n\nThis game is a load of fun, mainly because you can honestly do whatever you want. You can build a house, make a sprite from a game in blocks, have a deathmatch with some friends, it's almost ALL customizable.\n\nThere's also addons you can download to add new blocks, events, weapons, tools, and other things to the game. A example of a new way to play is Unlimited Mining, which is exactly what it says on the tin: Mining that can stretch forever. It may seem boring, but it's not just the same ores. The deeper you dig, the closer you get to the Core, which has more valuable and radiated ores. and then, there's the secret area above grounds, that's very difficult to find...\n\nThe multiplayer's fun as well, you just need to be careful on what servers you go on, and read their rules carefully. Some people don't seem to get this, and end up joining random servers, get banned, and get all flustered wondering what they did wrong. People have their own rules, and others might not want you on your server.\n\nAnd finally, there's the downtime. Normally, this isn't our fault. It's a problem with a few other people, like BDX, or Man of Reason, DDoSing the server when they feel like it, causing the master server and forums to go down. The master server is how you are able to see the server list. If that's down, you probably won't be able to join any servers.\n\nEven though this game may seem off due to bad reviews, this game is what helped me finally play with others and have some fun. It was fun in 2008, and it's fun now. Try buying it while it's on sale, when it ever does, so you can spend less to try it. Even better, you can download the demo here: http://blockland.us/Download.html\n\nYou'll have to buy the game in order to play past the block limit, but trust me, it's much better when you're not limited.","December 26, 2014","true","519.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

There were many custom maps to explore, and lots of community gamemodes to play. There was always a lot of people to play with and the community was generally awesome. Did you notice any thing about those last sentences? One; Everything I listed was community-made. The developer's actual content is not very interesting to play with for more than a few hours. Two; It was past tense. Maps were actually REMOVED from the game for no good reason and a good portion of the community left due to that. And then RTB stopped. RTB, or Return to Blockland, was a mod for Blockland which worked as a mod manager and also friends list. RTB was awesome and was the only thing anyone used to keep track of friends and get mods. And then, one day, RTB was gone. The servers were down and you couldn't download it anymore. That caused a large portion of to leave the game and now we're left with the remains of a once amazing game, barely managing to keep enough players.\n\nYou could buy this game as it is. I wouldn't blame you. This game is still good, if only for a day or two. But if you do buy this, I recommend this to go along with it: https://github.com/portify/blockland-20\nDISCLAIMER: You cannot use this without owning Blockland, and even if you could, I would not endorse doing so without a purchase. If you run a server on the main master server of Blockland using this version, your account may be terminated.","July 8, 2015","false","50.5"," 54 of 89 people (61%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","61","54","89","6","5"

The game also has a lot of add-ons and modifications.\nHowever, the worst part of Blockland is the community. Just go to http://forum.blockland.us and see how horrible it is for youself. It's basically a group of users who argue a lot and spend more time on the forums than playing the actual game.\n\nDevelopment is also deteriorating. Version 21, which was released in August 2012, was the last major update to the game. It was supposed to make it easier to add more features in the future, but a major update has not been released yet. Blockland also uses a 15-year-old game engine and this causes a lot of problems for add-on makers, such as glitchy vehicle physics and limitations on projectile speed.\nIn conclusion: great gameplay and originality, but horrible community and slow development.\n\nEDIT: Yesterday, Heedicalking, a notable member of the Blockland community peacefully protested against the lack of the new features (which were promised exactly 2 years ago).

Here are the reasons why:\nThe in-game servers and content don't have the same variety or atmosphere as they had when I first bought the game 3 or 4 years ago. Although that could just be nostalgia talking, that is, of course, something that drastically affects my relationship and experience with the game.\nThe engine isn't at all the best (After all, it's more than a decade old. To be more frank, the game engine is virtually ancient.), which puts some signifcant limitations on modders, despite the admittedly incredulous amount of flexibility and ease of the add-on system.\nAlthough there are some good-looking shaders, they are not well-optimised, and were put into the game hastily at the cost of the mapping system that the game had, at the dismay of many players.\nThe creator of the game, Badspot, has shown little to no interest in actively participating in enriching Blockland's community and playability, and although he does argue that the players are very much capable of expanding the enjoyment of the game, the players alone are not as impactful as an update from the creator of the game that would allow more capacity to do what you want with the game, regardless of the level of quality and initiative of the said community at hand.Although that's all I could think of right now, I will add more of my gripes and arguments about this game in later edits, and maybe even possibly completely rewrite this review. Like I said earlier, it's not as fun and filled with variety in user-generated content as it was before, which could very well say something about the community. I have been playing far before the game even was greenlighted on Steam, and have witnessed the transformation of this game overtime. If the developer of the game or other members of the community would like to talk to me about this review, or perhaps get feedback from me on my opinion on how to improve the game, you are more than welcome to.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pacnet/recommended/250340/","pacnet","Pacnet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pacnet/","52 products in account","I think this game has gone downhill for a while. I remember when I first played it in 2010 and it was pretty decent I guess. There was a good stream of updates now and then and the game was actually enjoyable. But now I have no idea where it's gone to. The community of the game really drags it down for me, and since this game is almost 90% based on multiplayer, it might affect you too. The community is not forgiving at all so if you do something wrong/bad you will still be bashed for it years later. The community loves to accuse you of doing things that you never did, such as conducting a denial of service attack. Nowadays, the creator barely pushes out updates and there hasn't been any meaningful updates for what seems to be an eternity. The creator of the game also is censoring people's negative reviews and banning them from discussions for peacefully expressing their opinions both on Steam and the Blockland Forums (by the way, if you're going to play the game, never join the Blockland Forums for sure. I can't tell you how screwed up that place is).\n\nThe game is, from time to time, enjoyable when you find a good server that is fun and has no hostile/bashing people on it. But otherwise I think this game has really gotten worse since my first purchase of it in 2010.\n\nYou choose if you want the game and are willing to completely ignore the community. I don't suggest you play it if you want to play on multiplayer a lot. The community is small and everybody can quickly know who you are and attack you for the rest of your stay if you screw up a few times.\n\nAlso there's the "screw-up recurrence" game. You screw up and you know what you did was dumb. But the community keeps attacking you so you intentionally fight back and then at that point you're marked as a "problem user" and immediately banned from all game discussions. So if you like to express your opinions without censorship regarding the game, this is not the place to do it.\n\nYeah my review will probably be censored since i'm marked as a "problem" user but what can I say?\n\nYou choose if you can ignore a hostile/corrupted/censoring community and creator where people actually think you can mark an "opinion" as wrong. If you can, sure, play the game all you want and maybe you'll enjoy it. If you don't think you can, you might not want to try this game. I think this game is pretty good but the community/creator is bad.\n\nThat's just my personal opinion, you can try the game and see if you like it. I mean it has events, vehicles, add-ons, weapons and a bunch of cool stuff but the community / creator drag it down for me so you can choose if it matters to you.\n\n\n*UPDATE 8/7/2014*\n\nThe creator also has censored posts / banned people from the official game forum. The posts were constructive criticism (not intended to insult or flame in any way) which expressed disappointment due to the lack of meaningful updates and unmet promises of the developers.\n\nThe community member who has most recently been affected by this is Heedicalking, a well known community member who is known for making good servers (frequently team deathmatch servers).\n\nHe expressed his disappointment in the lack of development in a constructive and respectful way but he was banned twice and his posts were censored (deleted).\n\nHere is a backup of the censored posts (they are written by Whitebeard and SHU-YA)\n\nhttp://blocklandcloud.com/20140807-heedicalking-deleted-posts/\n\nhttp://blocklandcloud.com/20140807-heedicalking-deleted-posts2/","July 3, 2014","false","505.2"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","0"

I wouldn't reccomend picking up Blockland as the developer has essentially stopped working on the product.\n\n\nMinecraft is a much more adventure-based sandbox game with a lively modding community and is suitable for younger players (including children), but doesn't lose its appeal on adults.\n\nSpace Engineers is (as of writing) an early access game for building your own space craft. Its building system feels like Blockland, but it's backed by a very cool physics engine. More suitable for older players and adults, especially if you're interested in realism and engineering based sandbox games.\n\nBlockland was a game I played for quite some time, but it hasn't aged well and has been usurped by newer and better things.","August 6, 2014","false","3.9"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","16","23","0","2"

What I was faced with was instant regret and $10 less than I had beforehand. I am a very picky customer and I VERY rarely buy games but when I was told this game was like garrysmod meets legos I thought, okay maybe I'll give this a shot. What I was faced with was horrifying. I started up the game, went to create my character and was faced with the saddest excuse for a character creation system ever. It was so poorly designed and shallow that many would confuse that monstrosity for the work of ljn. This game is so poorly designed and it seems to be aimed towards children 6 to 10. It was a fair attempt but it just falls flat in my opinion. The video samples of the game were convincing so I thought maybe that the gameplay could be redeeming. After a painstakingly long loading screen, I was faced with terrible gameplay, no voice chat options and a painful amount of little kids. Among this little kids were "Pizza Man", "Buttman", and "Awesome Guy". This game has made me question everything I once held as holy. Please, NEVER buy this horrible, horrible game because all that awaits you is immediate disappointment. After I finish this review I am instantly deleting this garbage. It isn't worth the 50 MB it takes up. If anyone needs me I'll be weeping over the loss of my $10. I would buy this MAYBE for $2 but I would have to be in a REALLY bad way to resort to this game. Stick to flash games over this. They are free, you won't get burned, and you won't have the feeling of looming stupidity that I am currently experiencing.

The community is horrible at times, and extremely helpful at others. I started the game a while ago, then stopped playing it for a bit (I got bored of it). Then, I came back a year later, seeing no maps, and got slightly angry for a few days, and then got over it to see what it'd become. Bad, good, decent, hilarious, pathetic; Those were all going through my head as I relearned Blockland, although this time, I learned something new - Events. Eventing in Blockland is personally my favorite part (followed closely by the capability of them, and what you can make out of them). I still have a weekly rage session, just because some stupid thing happened in-game, but I don't mind. It's still among my favorite games.

It's interesting.\n\nI can see some people's issues with there not being enough parts, but the fact that you can make (or download) parts and toss them into an Add-Ons folder kinda gets rid of that complaint.  I think the biggest failing is the fact that the tutorial is REALLY basic, expecially where the wrench is concerned.  This game looks to be extremely powerful, but withot utilizing that power it's kind of like Superman having to remain Clark Kent because the world is made of Kryptonite.\n\nNow, that aside, I'm seeing a pretty nice game here.  The block selection is done fairly well, allowing you to customize your quick-bars to whatever parts you wish to use.  In addition you use the mouse to begin placement of a block, but then use the numberpad to fine-tune that placement.  This is great in a 3D environment, as it truly gives you easy control of your building.  It even goes so far to, when placing something wrong, tell you exactly why the placement was rejected (overlapping, etc).  Finally, there are enough DEMO worlds in this game that you can truly see all of the possibilities you can get into (as long as you know how the wrench works).\n\nWhen it all comes down to it, do I recommend people play this game?  Yes I do.  THAT SAID, continue reading...\n\nI do recommend people play this game, however I only recommend BUYING the game if you can get it at a reduced price like I did.  I got this game as part of a $2.99 bundle on Bundle Stars, and for that price this game is well worth the money.  Would I pay $10+ for it?  Absolutely not, because it doesn't have a strong dev team behind it, the developer has a really bad attitude, and I doubt it'll ever be "finished".\n\nThe most I'd ever pay is $2.99 for this game by itself...  That's a lot, considering I'm expecting the developer to see a lawsuit by Lego in the future.","October 12, 2014","true","1.7"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","19","30","0","0"

It's gotten me entirely into what I can call a 'lust for technology', because otherwise, I wouldn't be as interested in technology as a whole if it weren't for Blockland. Another thing is that, most everything I have learned or started to develop a skill about is also rounded about on Blockland, specificly, my sound designing 'expertise'. As a side note, I'm actually investing in sound recording equipment this christmas.\n\nBlockland is not only largely based upon it's users to make content, much like Roblox or maybe even Minecraft, but it does a good job of making it easy to do so. I'm just barely starting off with being a content creator for the game yet I've already got the ropes, and I already create some good stuff for the game.\n\nThe community isn't as great as most lego games, but it's in a way, a 'mature' community. The community is incredibly assholish, especially on the forums, but in a way where most of the people won't go overboard over small things, and if you aren't a total idiot people won't try to kill you.\n\nLastly, I just wanna say, Blockland has many memories planting itself into my mind that I probably will never forget. The game holds so much promise for the future, and has always delivered in the past. People have doubted it before, even the community itself, but the game always keeps moving forward. Roblox, to compare, still retains it's immature community, it's pretty laggy systems, and it's really money-sucking notoriety for builders club.","December 16, 2013","true","715.8"," 28 of 47 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","28","47","0","1"

There is also an incredibly large amount of player-made resources and mods to expand the gameplay to pretty much anything you can think of. Stop playing games that limit you to building with one size blocks and play a game that truly gave many the best gaming experiences they've ever had.\n\nAlso while you're at that, check out my blockland videos on my Youtube channel!\n\nyoutube.com/sirherg1","December 16, 2013","true","13.2"," 33 of 57 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","33","57","0","3"

BTW how did they manage the licence problem?\nBlockland has a long history with an included social media platform and earlier IRC chats. I have heard of uncountable user maps that have exist. The hope is that on steam this project will be revived. There are several new game servers and now you're able to communicate over steam.\nThe graphics are average. For good example there's a fog of distance. But it is comfortable on the other side to play it just in window mode if you want. You can choose different game modes like car races or battle arena or free building. Blockland's strength is the huge library of existing models and build parts. It's easy to set spawn points for zombies or equip weapons to your character.\nTough there are other LEGO style or Minecraft style games out there, like Ace of Spades, but i think Blockland is a tryout worth.","March 10, 2014","true","12.3"," 61 of 110 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","61","110","0","3"

It's like playing with legos, on the computer, and you don't have to buy the said legos. This game is what I have played a lot, just like another game I've played a lot. If you love legos, and are too lazy to get the money to buy real legos, then this game is for you. And one of the awesome things is that you can host your own server if you wanted, and addons are really easy to install. I recommend this game to people who have someform of creativity and loves legos. Just becarful when exploring the server list, there are some strange servers out there... not saying all of the servers are bad, just some of those servers could cause you to lose your sanity being there. I happen to host a server, though I don't get very many players thanks to certaint people who shan't be named for reasons that I will not tell you about. Though there can be some downsides to this game, it tends to cause weaker computers to crash, which is annoying since I have a horrable computer, but if you know what you're doing, and keep the addon count small, you'll be fine with hosting a server, and don't be afraid to ban people, they break the rules on your server, so it gives you the full right to ban them. And there are other people who complan about how bad the server is, and here's a little tip when dealing with them, simply tell them this "My server, my rules. If you got a problem with this, then get off of my server." and then ban them if they do not stop, and if you don't want them returning day after day, calling you some very rude, and stupid, names, then perma ban them, like I said, it's your server, you decide how it works, if people don't like it, then they don't like it. You can't change that. And be sure to be a very kind person so people like you, if you do that, more and more people will show up on your server. These are my words of wisdom for hosting a server, I'd share my wisdom on how to not be banned on other servers within five seconds, but I do not have time for that today. Good luck, my good people, you're going to need it. Also, check out my some of my guides for Blockland, I only have one at the moment, but feel free to check them out!","April 8, 2015","true","225.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

In 2005, it was a little work-in-progress building game on the Torque Game Engine. Being an alpha, it had (here comes a massive understatement) quite a few mods that generated a larger following. The full game released in 2007, and much more polished than anything seen before. Streams of updates from the game's sole creator (with some collaboration thrown in) in the past six years have created a unique game that nothing can hope to come close to.\n\nSo, what's the main point? Blockland is That Game Where You Build Stuff. It's all on you, and the community. Using LEGO-like blocks to create structures in online multiplayer may sound mundane on paper, but the online part is where it really shines. The amount of creativity Blockland players have is nothing short of amazing. User-created add-ons like weapons and vehicles are plentiful, allowing for different and fun gamemodes within buildings YOU create, and an "events" system gives way for even more creativity within builds.\n\nAn accessible sandbox game for such a price is almost a steal.","December 16, 2013","true","49.2"," 34 of 60 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","34","60","0","0"

The game hasn't been updated since December 23rd, 2015 if you're counting bug fixes. Don't count bug fixes, and the last major update was February 5th, 2012. The server list will have a wave of empty servers and 5 that are on and nearly full every day. Those 5 are the same gamemodes 24/7. Don't expect to host a server people will like, only popular people have more than 5 people on at once. Even then, 2 of the 5 will be afk.\n\nThe forum is much more active, given not only people discussing the game but anything they feel like in the Off-Topic sections. 70% of these people do not play Blockland anymore. The community is toxic to even the slightest mistakes, as random arguments and outbursts are expected from a website full of teenagers and smug college students.\nTrolls get away with baiting daily and nobody can say anything without spawning a 50 page argument that devolves into a discussion on which anime to watch. You aren't allowed to tell someone you don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about their topic no matter how much you want to because its against the rules. Much like in-game, your forum threads will die unless they are interesting or you are popular. If you join, you will be accused of being an alt (or alternate account) no matter what, no exceptions. The developer reserves the right to ban you at any point for the slightest slip-up while add-on creators practically take over game development for him.\n\nBut it has legos, which is nice.","March 8","false","869.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","8","11","3","2"

And with a large portion of the community having mental illnesses such as Autism, it can be very annoying at most times. (Im not saying people with a legitimate mental illness are bad, but they can be annoying without even knowing it)\n\nNow, there is some good with this game. The user-created content back from around 2010 still remains extremely popular today, and builds, bricks, weapons, and tools still remain extremely fun to mess around with today, in the game's single player. There are even brick add-ons that add even more actual LEGO blocks to the game!\n\nHowever, in conclusion, your $10 dollars would be MUCH better spent on a different game, perhaps one of the older GTA games?

Blockland is the first game I ever bought, almost 6 years ago. Holy ♥♥♥♥. Back then, it was still $20, and I can tell you now that I would have paid five times that amount back then if I knew how much I would have loved it.\n\nOther people have already explained the building system and the events system, so I won't really talk about those. What I would like to talk about, however, is the add-on creation system. Don't get me wrong, I truly enjoy building and eventing, but I wouldn't keep coming back to this game as often as I do if there weren't any add-ons. Not even just using add-ons though. More than that: creating them, changing them, collaborating on them. Even though some of the coding may be limited by the engine in this game, it more than makes up for this by flattening the learning curve for making your own mods. In my honest opinion, there are way more possibilities for creativity because of this. Because more people are making add-ons, there is a lot more diversity and plenty of originality when it comes to gamemodes, server mods, etc.\n\nThe reason why I said "at the very least, 2000 hours", is because of all the time I've spent in text editors, writing code. That's actually the reason why you won't see many hours played on my steam account for Blockland, I'm in the midst of making a big gamemode (look for it, people of the future). This game is where I learned how to do basic logic constructions and other similar things for writing code. The language is called "torquescript", and it's pretty similar to C in most ways. It's incredibly easy to learn because of the syntax checker (to catch any mistakes you make), and because you can instantly see the result of your code ingame. Because of my previous experience with coding, I've been able to pick up visual basic and C almost instantly. For my job, I was able to program a z-axis camera mount using C# and also to make a protocol for an x-y motion system using a custom compiler for visual basic. I've included these in my resume, and next year when I leave for college there's no doubt in my mind that I will continue using code. In fact, it's very likely that my experience with code will have helped me get in the school of my choice (already accepted to one of my top choices).\n\nWhile I know this isn't necessarily something that everyone will experience if they play the game, I know I just wanted to share my story. Know that even if you have no interest in modding, Blockland has something for you. I've never seen, heard, or smelled of a game that could truly have "endless possibilities". That is, except for Blockland.","January 3, 2014","true","77.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

You want to abuse rapid firing rockets via an event system or just want to build a humble little home? Well, here's your solution.\n\nI reccomend the first thing you'd want to do is go to Start A Game and click on the Tutorial gamemode. Then start this game and make it singleplayer and follow the steps shown on screen.\n\nThe game uses an easy to install add-on system, which is basically finding the Steam directory on your computer (Windows: Steam > SteamApps > Common > Blockland) and dragging and dropping your selected file into the AddOns Folder. I think this system will eventually be modded and changed to work with Steam Workshop like Garry's Mod. Once you have the right addons and knowledge of how to use them, the possibilities for a good server are endless.\n\nThe building mechanics are very simple once you get the hang of them - simply using the numpad/your selected control scheme to maneuver the blocks into the right place and pressing Enter  when your ''Ghost Brick (Invisible brick you will see when you click the ground to move a block around) is above a support or another block. Then you can use the Paint Can (default key is E) to paint this block a selected colour.\n\nPhysics-wise, this game is absolutely mad. If you think it's hilarious to have your car flung into oblivion then this game is definitely the one you want. This also kind of falls into the category of graphics. This game's visuals are not the best, but definitely better than Minecraft's. (Sorry Notch.)\n\nThe game uses an eventing system which is a basic scripting mechanism. I think there should be a guide somewhere on the magic that is the Steam page, and that also tells you the rest about the game.\n\n\nAlso, little LEGO guys.\nThey're so cute.\n\n\n10/10 would build giant castle again.","December 17, 2013","true","406.3"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","5"

If you like to build things, this is one of the best games you can get to do so. There are tons of things you can do in this game, like creating DMs, RPGs, racing builds, and sports arenas. You name it and you can probably build it. You can easily make the things you want to build with good building controls and a nice, clean user interface. Plus there is even a very useful event system that you can use, so you can turn a light switch on or off, create bots to interact with your build, and much, much more. People have also created a vast amount of mods that Blockland calls "add-ons", using the game's built-in mod support. The only real flaw of the game, would be some of the community if you ever decide to play the game online, but if you stick around the servers that have nice people on it, you can have a really good time making new friends and just having a blast fooling around. There are tons of other features that I haven't even mentioned and some vital add-ons that make this game a lot better like the Duplicator and the Fill Can. All in all, if you like to build and like a game where you can do anything you want at any time, just click that buy button. If you are a bit skeptical about the game and you need to experience it firsthand before buying, there is a demo available on the official website (http://www.blockland.us).

From version 9 and up, it was a great game, nearly everyone ♥♥♥♥ their pants when they heard about a new update because it brought new content to the table. Now it's rarely updated with versions that would constitute themselves more as a hotfix rather than anything else. We've arrived at the end of blockland's development and Badspot has practically lost all interest in the game. Is this a bad thing? For me, not really, seeing as there are always modders and mapmakers ready to enhance the game's experience. Let me tell you, there are many mods out there to suit your tastes, so I hope you'll never be bored with the different possibilities. As far as creativity goes, you can go all out and push the limits of the game if you have to. It's basic lego building but with the ability to not go out to your local toys r us and dropping 30+ on a set of legos. You can also play mini-games and other stuff in these worlds that you build.\n\nSo to make things brief, the game is great. Go ahead and pick it up, it's only ~$10, try it out.

Played this game since it was first freeware (2004); the upgrade to retail in 2007 was worth it. I'd have more hours on this than TF2, if I'd kept track before the Steam edition.\n\nThis game taught me about art, scene design, project management, concepts of coding (events system and modifying game files), and teamwork; but the best part of it, was that I was just having a good old time building for TDM builds and helping out on RP servers.\n\nWhen large projects start to feel like work, I can always start a minigame in the city I'm building to ski away from dinosaurs, or hop on a public minigame server to vent some steam. The instant chaotic action of TDMs, boss-fights, and, more recently for me, Speed Kart racing, does the trick quite well (I used to hate the idea of racing; that is, until silly physics-gone-mad collisions were involved). When I'm feeling more dedicated, I'll team up on a CTF, dogfight, or trench war server to satiate my tryhard tastes.\nBut when I get back to that big project, and it's finished, it's the greatest when others can appreciate and experience your creation by walking the halls. Or running down them. Away from bears with pistols akimbo.\n\nA note for new builders: don't be intimidated by screenshots of massive-crazy-project builds. Start with what you know or feel is right. Your ability to create what you imagine will improve over time, like any art form, and will be greater scaling with the amount of time you put into it, and how many friends you have for work division and support.\nI started this game quite young, and having people tell me something looked good or bad influenced me a lot (very common in that stage of development); but I learned to pay the most attention to those who gave reasoning.

Every time I turn it on, there's always something to do, if you have a creative mind, this game is perfect for you. You can make nearly anything, houses, citys, spaceships, e.t.c. Even though the game comes with some default items, bricks e.t.c, there is a giant bunch of add-ons you can add to the game, to make it even more fun. Even though the loss of interiors and terrain has happened, the game is still as fun as ever. Blockland also has an event system, where you can make stuff happen, like make bricks dissapear, have them change color, and with Event add-ons, that's even fun too. The price used to be £18, and I think the game is worth it, and now, it's £7, so now you can have the same fun, for a good price, I am not even the tinyest bit annoyed about how I had to pay £17 and not £7, as Badspot (the creator) fully deserves it. I'm sorry for the giant review, but that's just how great and fun this game is. I could never understand how people can not like this game, as it's packed with a ton of stuff to do.

In Blockland you can do anything at all: play or make a team deathmatch, medieval rpg, zombie game, murder mystery, sports games, dogfight, portal, arcade games, prison escape, challenge, deathrun, racing games, farming rpg, city rpg, and infinitely more. I've been playing this game for years and it never gets old- something new is always coming out, and building + eventing is an extremely rewarding experience. This game is an awesome sandbox for people to build upon and come up with new game modes. Games should focus first on a fun gameplay experience, and Blockland manages this extremely well. By far my favorite game.\n\nBuy this now, you'll love it no matter your age :)","December 16, 2013","true","911.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThinkInvisible/recommended/250340/","ThinkInvisible","ThinkInvisible","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThinkInvisible/","96 products in account","Blockland describes itself as 'that game where you build stuff'. That's actually pretty accurate!\n\nContent\nBlockland runs on an older version of the Torque Game Engine. It revolves around what are essentially legos, as the title implies. You control a small plastic figure called a 'blockhead', and the core element of the game involves placing bricks (with very intuitive controls) and then changing them with paint, emitters, or a simple programming system to create pretty much anything. There's support for add-ons and a weapon system, which opens possibilities for team deathmatches and any number of other gamemodes.\n\nPositive\nThe controls. Blockland's movement and view controls are similar to any other 3D game - WASD to move, mouse to look, space to jump, so on, so forth. The build controls are almost as easy to use. Pressing a numpad key moves the brick in that direction, just like WASD; the corner keys move up and down or rotate the brick, and numpad 0 clears your 'ghost' brick (which shows where you're going to place it). This does take a day or two to learn well, but once you figure it out it's hard to think of a better way.\nBlockland also has decent multiplayer features, and involves a player-hosted server system. One of the core elements of the game is the fact that you're not just building stuff - you're all building stuff together. Servers can, by default, support up to 32 players; a workaround has been used to increase this to 99. The fact that servers are player-hosted removes most problems with lag; each individual server has to have a poor connection to be affected, instead of just one master server (there is, in fact, a master server, but it only keeps a list of all the servers players are hosting; IP connections can still be used).\nBricks can be 'evented', or programmed, to do a number of things. The events system acts on a per-brick basis and is actually very easy to understand. You choose an input from a drop-down box - like onActivate (when the brick is clicked) or onPlayerTouch (more self-explanatory), then a target (Player, Client, Brick, Named Brick, etc.), then an action (setColor, Kill, playSound). For example - onActivate -> Player -> addVelocity(0, 0, 10) would make a ladder rung, when clicked, give the player a boost up. More than one event can be placed on a brick, and they can be delayed or even chained together with something called a relay.\nFinally, Blockland has an extensive add-on system that can be used to change almost any part of the game. New bricks can be added, or emitters, or colors, or events, or any other number of things. Even the GUI is open for change; the only rules are those that the programming language sets. The programming language is, however, slightly limited by the game's creator; this is mostly to avoid hacking or cheating, which are nigh-impossible without illegally modifying the game.\n\nNegative\nFirst - the game carries the potential for what I call minecraft syndrome. You buy the game and just LOVE it; then you play it for several weeks or months and abruptly lose all interest. I first encountered this effect while playing Minecraft, hence the name; I used to play both games constantly, and now I haven't touched either of them for months for no apparent reason.\nSecondly, the game's community can be picky. Just mentioning Minecraft as above might get me some insults and complaints; half of Blockland's community is notorious for their hate of the games Minecraft and Roblox, the sole reason appearing to be that they're similar to Blockland (or vice verse). Also, the game has a website with a forum; there's a good share of good people as well as an impressive number of idiots that can be found there. The community isn't horrible, but it isn't the greatest I've seen, either.\nFinally, the game lost some of its former value with the v21 update. This update removed terrains and interiors - excellent parts of the game that allowed landscapes and buildings to be used as the scene for construction - in favor of shaders (like you might find in any other game) and bots (what it says on the tin). The game wasn't ruined, but it was definitely made worse. Terrains and interiors may return, and I hope they do, but having to build on an infinite flat plane shouldn't hinder your creativity!\n\nSummary\nBlockland's features outweigh its flaws - while the community could be nicer and some recent updates are questionable, the game has a solid base and a good number of features to support it. Its support for add-ons and mods make almost anything possible, and there's already a great number of these out there. If you enjoyed building with legos as a kid, consider yourself a decent artist, need practice with programming, or just want a good way to have fun with your friends - this game is for you.","June 25, 2014","true","142.1"," 31 of 58 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","31","58","0","0"

Multiplayer is fantastic with a huge variety of player-made gamemodes as well as a fun-loving, yet mature community. The visuals look gorgeous (Especially with shaders on.), the physics are a treat to see (Especially if you blow up a building made up entirely of small blocks.) and each server level has a completely different atmosphere.

Maps had terrain and objects that where not made out of blocks. but because the Shader system could not support the maps they where removed. meaning the only way you can get terrain is if you build it out of blocks. not a problem for people good with the blocks and those with a good computer. because having that many blocks hits the Frame Rate pretty bad.\n\n\nIn the end Blockland is a fun sandbox game that lets you do a lot of epic stuff. as long as your comptuer can handle it. it is in NO WAY a clone of Mincraft, Roblox, or any other block like game. if you enjoy games like Garry's Mod then Blockland will be perfect for you.\n","May 1, 2014","true","7.4"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

But, most importantly, it was fun.\n\nThen a bunch of years later, this game came out - and it is just absolutely amazing. Think of it as a sort of lego-builder's Garry's Mod. Sure, you've got your great building tools to make awesome ♥♥♥♥ with your friends in the default sandbox mode, within the limitations (it's still lego, so you can't have any floating bricks, for example), but apart from that, anyone can create new weapons, vehicles, and entirely new gamemodes with the game's scripting language (the uh, not terribly excellent TorqueScript).\n\nAnd the builds you make can be enhanced with event bricks, which are basically interactive bricks that'll react to say, a player walking on it, in ways that you define in the game with a simple system. Some dude made a playable pong using that, which is batshit crazy. And awesome.\n\nAll in all, I can't find a good way to end this, because I'm not a writer, but I really, truly love this game, and I wish more people would play it with me.\n\nGame of the year, every year, 10/10.","December 16, 2013","true","6.0"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hunnybunbun/recommended/250340/","hunnybunbun","Suzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hunnybunbun/","107 products in account","PROS:\n- Gameplay is fun and simple\n- Numbpad brick placement is fantastic and easy to use\n- Multiplayer custom gamemodes and add-ons are endless\n- Character customization is easy and can make for some pretty hilarious character costumes\n\nCONS:\n- Graphics are not optimized for ♥♥♥♥\n- Multiplayer Community is mostly dominated by cocky players (Hence, I said mostly)\n- Single-player can be boring. Otherwise there is no actual feedback from the game to the player.\n\nOVERVIEW:\nI have played games like Roblox, Minecraft and Ace of Spades, and find joy in those games because of the community's creative standpoint, and Blockland is no exception. This game is the easiest one to pick up because it ACTUALLY HAS A TUTORIAL! (Which is still dumb because you have to load it up, there is no "Tutorial" button anywhere so you're left to find it yourself.) The controls are easy AND difficult. If you're used to FPS controls of switching through your weapons using 1, 2,  etc. Then prepare to be tricked as your bricks are assigned to your number keys while your weapons are located in your tools inventory by pressing Q (Or binded key). The numbpad can be used to move your bricks along a grid before placing them, which helps A LOT. Not a lot of sandbox, blocky games have this kind of feature and just makes Blockland much easier to play and enjoy. As for bricks, THIS GAME HAS A TON and more can even be added as add-ons, which by the way, is simple and easy to understand so you can install a plethora of mods made by the community. The Multiplayer in this game is really fun and most likely the only way you will play. The community is thriving through servers so meeting people in one place and finding them in another is pretty common and honestly feels nice because it feels like you are really getting to know the community and its players. As for Multiplayer gameplay, expect the normal Call of Duty like feedback from players. The occasional "OMG stop playing like that!" does turn up and its just as annoying. But if you're a troll and like screwing with players, then it should be no different than from how you troll on any other game. For the cons listed, I feel really upset that these are actually issues, because most of it can be easily simplified and fixed, fun-wise. The graphics are really up there in terms of quality. High graphics means your computer is somehow a beast because most high-end graphic cards can't run this game to its full potential. As for Singleplayer gameplay. Its just a simple complaint. This may be more of a personal standpoint so understand that this is mainly just a suggestion if anything. Singleplayer is NOT fun. It doesn't matter if you nuke entire maps of zombie NPCs. You will get bored of playing alone EASILY, and it is only because there isn't any actual user-friendly feedback coming from the game. I understand it's a singleplayer mode in a sandbox game, but even Gmod has a way of communicating with the player to make them seem like they are a part of the games world, immersing them into the game and grabbing their attention to want to continue playing.\n\nThis game is not bad, but your own fun has to be found in it, especially in the Multiplayer which can still give you a great taste of the game's actual feel. I do recommend this game, but it does feel like it can easily be put down.","June 30, 2014","true","162.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

People still play, but it lost so much popularity. It's a fun sandbox building game where you can build and program anything. The way you build stuff is very similar to real-life LEGOs, where you are not allowed to have floating bricks. The law of gravity is impossible to break. You can still make bricks float by making invisible and walk through towers under a brick. You can press the left mouse button to activate your jets so you can fly around. There's a spray can that allows you to not only paint bricks, but give them special effects such as rainbows and also make bricks transparent. You start with three tools; a hammer, a wrench, and a printing gun. The hammer lets you break bricks you put, but you can't break bricks under another brick unless the brick you want to destroy won't cause the other bricks above to float in the air. You can type /wand to get a wand that acts just like a hammer, but if you destroy a brick that would cause any bricks above it to float, everything above it breaks also. The wrench lets you do many different things with your bricks. While holding the wrench, you can click on a brick to view its properties. You can make your brick emit fire, or smoke, or any other particle that's in the game. You can spawn more tools, like a sword or a gun, or something that'll help you build better things. You can also program your bricks with events. Events are super easy to learn. I made a basic Windows XP computer with very little knowledge of events when I was a noob, and the results were satisfactory! The properties will be different depending on the brick you select. For example, if I use the wrench on a vehicle spawner, I won't have the ability to make it into a spear giver. I can only select from a list of rideable objects. If I use the wrench on a music brick, I will be able to choose from a list of music for it to play. The printer gun lets you put pictures on printer bricks. It's useful for making signs for things like stores, or for cooler security systems. Building in Blockland is lots of fun! You can also download add-ons that other users made from other websites so you can get more content such as more guns and swords to blow up everyone, or tools to help you build better things. I hope Steam workshop comes out for this game soon so it'll be quicker to download and find add-ons. Blockland also has a minigame feature which lets you disable and enable certain fuctions such as building or jets and allow players to get points for doing certain tasks. With add-ons, you can enhance your minigames and make them even more fun to play with your friends. You could make a futuristic team deathmatch minigame, or a survival horror game using the popular Renderman add-on based on the legendary Renderman! This game has endless possibilities, and I am really sad to see it die like this. I mean it. I am literally sad. After the extremely popular Return to Blockland add-on was gone, many people started to give up on this game. Return to Blockland made Blockland more social by adding private chat (much like Steam's chat), friends, and the ability to join your friend in a server they are playing. It didn't just make Blockland a better game to play it friends. It gave you better admin tools. It allowed you to download add-ons very similar to how Steam workshop works. Many add-ons lost some functions because they depended on RTB. The Renderman add-on was one of them. You can't control when he spawns anymore. I will always remember how much fun Blockland was. R.I.P. one of my favorite sandbox games ever.","August 7, 2014","true","62.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I personally would rather have this community compaired to Minecraft or Roblox, or maybe even Gmod. It's just the way a lot of games are.\n\nAnyways, here's why I recommend Blockland;\n\n•You could build anything - It's like having infinite amount of every color of legos (which I always wished was a thing :c)\n\n•Lots and lots of add-ons! You could get anything from cars to doors, to gamemodes (including Super Murder Mystery, which is my all time favorite. This gamemode includes a few players who are in the mafia, who have to kill everyone else.)\n\n•Small community, meaning a better chance of running in to the same person multiple times, helping you make friends.\n\nTL;DR, Awesome game, little kids just keep your swear filter on.

Blockland was a wonderful prosperous game. Great community and servers. The game was in its prime with maps and players everyone helping others build massive cities and gamemodes for all around to enjoy. Then v21 came out and took out these wonderful maps. Lots of players stopped joining these great servers and leaving the game altogether. There was still a lot of players left to build up from the rubble of this update. After a while the community slowly died. Then it hit, RTB shut down. This was the soul of the game, it held all the players' ideas and creations. Thus with this community website shutting down, it killed this game. Servers are barren, players are dazed and confused, creations dwindled. The game hit its peak then dropped harder than it should have. It's still a wonderful game it's just there are about a max population of 300 players on a day with about 90 or so servers up. About 30% of servers will have 0-2 players just sitting there, doing nothing.\n\nStory brought to you by loads of hours of offline steam play before it hit the greenlight. Still recommending this because it's still fun with a group of friends.","April 17","true","93.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I never actually thought that I'd see a building game that got my attention. The grahpics are amazing, the animations are appealing. But, I have to be honest, the community is just..terrible. Depending on who it is, or where he/she is from, it doesn't make a make a big change or impact on the community. But, appart from that, on single-player its actually pretty peaceful. You can make ideas for your server that you're "going" to make, or just have fun freebuilding. Basically, this game is similar to minecraft but with a different building style. I thought you might want to read this before you actually get into the game, so you have a little notion of what you're doing. The building style uses the Numpad keys, 123456789 and 0, the Numpad keys move the brick to where you want it to go, without clicking somewhere and it goes. Overall-review: 9/10. I like the game, but the community just bad. But, I have not listed all the details about Blockland, you can read about it in different reviews.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gabeux/recommended/250340/","gabeux","Gabeux","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gabeux/","235 products in account","[ Introduction ]:\nBlockland is a mix between Roblox (non-steam) and a bit of Garry's Mod, therefore looking and playing like a "Roblox done right".\nThe idea of the game is great: allowing players to build things with LEGO blocks and host their own servers with different game types.\nFor further customization and setting of servers, Blockland also presents a simple enough Eventing System (simplified scripting) allowing the user to affect the entities, game client or the game running in the server.\n\n[ Positive Points ]:\n- Freedom of creation: For those who like to create and host servers, there is a great deal of freedom in the game, allowing anyone to create and host an unique server.\n- Easy to learn and get started.\n- DIfferent gametypes, that varies from Freebuild to Kart Races (with or without guns), Team Deathmatchs, CityRPGs, Empire (Civilization-like mini-games) and more.\n\n[ Negative Points ]:\n- As expected, the worst part of the game is it's community, probably composed by many children (or brain-damaged young adults and adults). Some very annoying and immature/offensive/pornographic stuff is said on the chat in any server. Even some servers Admins/Moderators are stupid and may get into the way of the players (derping in the middle of a firefight, standing in the middle of a road during a race, etc).\n- Also as expected due to the large amount of stupid members, many people don't know how to read, don't bother or are simply trolls, and dedicate themselves in annoying others. Stupid players also ruin RP games, like "Super Murder Mystery" (Blocklands' Trouble in Terrorist Town counterpart), turning most RP games into TDMs with lots of RDMing. Many mods and admins do their best to keep their servers clean, but any player will see this happening many times.\n- Buggy and laggy collision physics on vehicles, make some game modes very annoying or take much fun away.\n- Build mode can be very boring to work with when using a laptop without a numpad.\n- Little number of players and servers (from my experience).\n\n[ Conclusion ]:\nIf you can get past the annoying community, there's fun to be had in Blockland. Switching between game modes and the shared simplicity of the games is very fun. Forming up a group of friends to play on a self-made server is also a great idea.\n\nI'm pretty sure that Garry's Mod would be a better option, but still, Blockland has it's own vibe to it to make it worth a try, so try the Demo from the official site before buying.","December 26, 2013","true","17.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

One of the coolest things back in the day was being part of a building clan. For the most part, those days are over with the exception of a few withstanding groups. However, the community (at least most of it) is still very good, and I'm sure new subcommunities will form with an influx of new people.\n\nThe possibilities in this game are literally endless, especially with the advantage of the RTB Mod, which allows you to access a database of add-ons for your game as well as communicate with others who are currently in the game.\n\nIt takes a bit of patience to master the controls, but success comes through persistence (though persistantly asking for admin in a server will get you kicked!!!).\n\nI can't wait to see what's in store for Blockland as far as new game-modes, mods, and people!

While Roblox is now a slot machine, it still maintains to update itself in such a fashion.

While Roblox is now a slot machine, it still maintains to update itself in such a fashion. Its now more sleek and modern that Blockland here, and that normally wouldn't be a problem, but the problem is that this the year of 2014.\n\nI'm not saying that you can't release games like Shovel Knight, but from playing Blockland in 2008, to actually buying it on Steam in 2014, not a single damn thing has hardly been changed/updated.

The game implements such great and innovative ideas that I can never go back to roblox or minecraft. There are no griefers online because of the games "trust" system. People can't build on your bricks unless you grant them trust (which you can give them through the player list GUI). There are two types of trust: the first type is build trust were people are allowed to build on your bricks, the second type is full trust were people are allowed to modify and delete your bricks. You can also demote someone's trust or take it away from them entirely so they can't build on your stuff.\n\nThe administrative options are great as well. If someone spammed bricks all over your server you don't have to manually clean them up. Instead the admin GUI allows you to clear all the bricks of a specific user. You can also choose to spy on a person through the GUI to see if they are misbehaving. You can also load a save that you built before if you are an admin so you dont have to always build everything up on a server. There are also two different types of admins: admin and super admin. An ordinary admin can ban, admin orb (fly around and go through bricks) and load bricks. A super admin can do all that but it can also deadmin ordinary admins and ban them, they can also change what mods and gamemode is on the server as well.\n\nAnother great thing is the event system. This allows you to create simple function with your bricks. So if you want to can have so when you click on a certain brick it disappears, or have a building explode when you step over a brick. The game also has bots that you can also event. This allows you to change their appearance, their weapon, if they are an ally or enemy, and much more. You can also apply lights to bricks and emitters which add smoke, grass, and different effects. This adds much more life to your builds and instead of just making a build for people to look at on a free build. You can create an adventure were people have to battle bots or have to collect keys to open doors.\n\nThe minigame system is also amazing. With this system people can create their own game within the game. This allows them to select a playertype, select what weapons to start out with, etc. then invite people to join it. So people can be DMing on a free build of they want but this won't affect the people who didn't join the minigame. So you can have people fighting in a deathmatch, people racing, and people happily building all on the same server (the minigame system can be disabled if you want).\n\nThe game also very moddible which keeps the game fresh. Installing a mod is very easy. Just put the zip into the adding folder, enable it in the custom game mode option and your done. There is also a mod called "return to blockland" which allows you to download mods ingame. The mods can be adding more vehicles, more events, different skyboxes, different bricks, basically anything. There is also a type of mod called a gamemode which packages a bunch of different addons into one and loads save and different gamemode options.\n\nThe only real flaw of the game is that there aren't a big variety of servers up due to the community being so small. But the great thing is that you can create just about anything and it allows you to set up your own server without port forwarding so you can just create any type of server you want.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes building and Legos. Even to people who don't because there is such a large variety of things to do. This is the best building game I have played and puts other building games to shame.","December 16, 2013","true","205.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gckrastin/recommended/250340/","gckrastin","GCKrastin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gckrastin/","60 products in account","Preface: I've had this game since 2010 back in v16 and it has changed a LOT since then.  I've watched the community grow and change and I've probably spent several hundred hours on the game before it came to Steam.\n\nBlockland is a creative sandbox game created in 2004 by Badspot.  A lot of people say it's kind of like Lego Garry's Mod, which isn't far from the truth.  I love this game to pieces and always have, but it does have certain flaws that can seriously hinder the experience at times.\n\nThe game is great because you can do nearly anything, but the community is a bit... strange, at times.  There are two groups of people in the game: the noobs that don't know how anything works, and the old-timers that are either very supportive of newcomers or are spiteful towards them.  There's not much middle ground between these groups and quite a lot of the veteran players have left the game since v21 was released, a few months before the game came to Steam.\n\nThe biggest actual gameplay drawbacks will be very obvious within the first couple hours of playing: a bad physics engine and subpar graphics.  The physics engine has been buggy and unpredictable since the game's creation, although the graphics are actually substantially better now than before.\n\nPossibly the only thing that has really kept me playing the game this long is the giant amount of user-made content that can be found on the official forums.  The custom add-ons really bring the game to life and it's somewhat bland without them.  Nearly every popular server runs many add-ons, allowing for an even more custom and unique experience.\n\nDue to its Garry's Mod-like sandbox nature, Blockland has also inspired several notable video makers on YouTube, including Teneksi, Filipe1020, 8bitcube, Flubbman97, SirHerg1, and others.\n\nI'm trying not to be too wordy, so I'll just do pros and cons now cuz I'm boring like that.\n\nPros:\n\n- Great building system allowing for near-endless creativity\n- Lots of great public servers to join\n- Huge catalog of mods and add-ons\n- Not difficult to set up a server (can be tricky sometimes if your internet is weird)\n- Community has lots of nice people that will help new players learn the game\n- Low price\n\nCons:\n\n- Buggy physics\n- Average graphics\n- Controls can take a while to get used to\n- Not frequently updated (back in the day there was usually an update every couple weeks or so, but there hasn't been anything major since January 2014 as of this review)\n- Community has lots of trolls\n\nThe community is both a pro and a con because depending on who you meet, it could really go either way.\n\nOverall, I would say the game is definitely one of my favorite games of all time and even if you don't like it, it's only $10 USD spent.  That's really all there is to say about the game, and I hope you try it out!","August 11, 2014","true","200.7"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","1"

My opinions are based on my play experiences.\n\nI don't think it's fair to compare this to LEGO in anyway.  The blocks in the game do not go together in the ways that real LEGO bricks do.  For example I never found a way to change the direction of studs (SNOT building).  And the selection of blocks is very minimal without installing a bunch of extra mods or add-ons.\n\nIn fact, the game seems to require a certain amount of user-created material to be something other than demo or alpha quality.  So if you're just looking for a fun out-of-the-box experience, look elsewhere.","June 26, 2014","false","2.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

This is not a game where you learn how to play it in a month. This game takes a while to master the controls and knowledge of it. It is probably the most flexible, while still remaining stable, sandbox game I have ever played in my lifetime. Yes, it may seem like Roblox's evil cousin or a Minecraft rip-off or whatever, but it has one thing each of those doesn't; A fun-loving and creative community. Each modder is a valuable member of the community, infact; a lot of dedicated people (regular everyday gaming people) have been recruited into the staff more often than you may think.\n\nPeople will play this for a few weeks, not like it, and turn it down. Which is fine, this game may not be for everyone, but the reason this takes a while to get used to is because there's really no other game like it. It's like stepping into high school for the first time. It's different. Yes, every game has it's share of bad sports, trolls, and idiots, but once you look into the community and spend some time to master the controls, you can literally do anything you want. This game is a First Person Shooter, Role-Playing Game, Arcade Game, and so much more. And for those of you who have already given up on the game, I ask you to give it one more shot, to spend time to know how to work the game, and really let your imagination go wild. Everything you see in the photo previews were all built by humans who started out in your shoes. There is really no limits.

But don't get me wrong, this game is still tons of fun! Similar to Garry's mod, it is easlily added on to, there are goals only set by the players, and there are TONS of halarious moments.\n\nFirst, I want to start with the gameplay.\nIt is about as rock solid as the game will ever get. Blockland appeals to a broad audience through it's open ended ways of playing. For instance, you can build if you are into creativity. Lets say that you don't care for building, that is not a problem. You could join a multiplayer kart race, deathmatch or some other original gamemode that Blockland could boast. The only thing bogging this part down is the slow multiplayer connections and the TERRIBLE physics. And by TERRIBLE, I mean if you hit somebody with a car just right, or should I say wrong, you could in fact get a one way ticket to the statosphere. (Then again, it's not exactly bad when it happens to your friend, in fact that's halarious). If you have a good internet connection, then this game's multiplayer will appeal to you.\n\nWell, I don't really have another category to cover so...\n\n\nPros-\n\n* Been around for 7 years, still active updates (sorta).\n* Easy to mod\n* Fun Multiplayer\n* Creative Structure\n* Solid, refined gameplay concepts\n* I have had no problems with the community so far\n* Good graphics for a block game.\n* Makes halarious moments with or without friends around\n\nCons-\n\n* The physics can be beyond bad.\n* Bad multiplayer connections.\n* Did I mention the physics?\n* Setting up a multiplayer server is brutally hard. (not really their fault)\n(EDIT: I found a few more)\n*The public multiplayer has the worst community you will ever witness.\n*Lack of ambition (The game feels like it's becoming more and more abandoned each day)\n\n\nIn my opinion, this game is solid enough to achieve a 8.9/10\n\nIm sure people will like it, but DEFINETLY NOT everyone.\nBut for only ten dollars, it's one of the greatest user created content games that predates minecraft.","May 15, 2014","true","38.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I may have been just a kid when I first bought this game, but it is still amazing, I would reccommend this game over Garry's Mod because of it's great build system, gamemodes, and events system, which allows you to manipulate items and do amazing things. For a simple example, if you use events on a block, you could make it so that by touching the block you go flying into the air with your butt on fire. There are numerous possibilities with this game, it's simeoultaneously a FPS shooter, a 3rd Person Shooter, a racing simulator, a Dogfight simulator, a Quake-Like Deathmatch arena, a City RPG, a Jail RPG, and anything you can possibily think of. This is all thanks to the numerous enjoyable addons created by the community such as different gamemodes and addons. Very very underrated for it's quality as a game. People try to compare this game Roblox and then subsequently judge it based on that terrible game, but this should not be the case, because first of all it was created long before Roblox, second it has a much better community, third it has a much better building system, and fourth it has much more possibilities in terms of addons, gamemodes, and maps.","December 30, 2013","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've had this game for over 5 years and put in over 1000 hours into it before it came to steam, it's the best sandbox game I've ever played because there is just so much you can do. I may have been just a kid when I first bought this game, but it is still amazing, I would reccommend this game over Garry's Mod because of it's great build system, gamemodes, and events system, which allows you to manipulate items and do amazing things. For a simple example, if you use events on a block, you could make it so that by touching the block you go flying into the air with your butt on fire. There are numerous possibilities with this game, it's simeoultaneously a FPS shooter, a 3rd Person Shooter, a racing simulator, a Dogfight simulator, a Quake-Like Deathmatch arena, a City RPG, a Jail RPG, and anything you can possibily think of. This is all thanks to the numerous enjoyable addons created by the community such as different gamemodes and addons. Very very underrated for it's quality as a game. People try to compare this game Roblox and then subsequently judge it based on that terrible game, but this should not be the case, because first of all it was created long before Roblox, second it has a much better community, third it has a much better building system, and fourth it has much more possibilities in terms of addons, gamemodes, and maps.","December 30, 2013","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now I have the full game, and the possibilities are pretty much limitless. There is so much to do and/or create with Blockland. If you had a passion for Legos as a child, you might enjoy this game... a lot. It has the building mechanics of Legos, with the gameplay and versatility of Garry's Mod. The only setback for this game's potential is the community. There are always good people, but the majority seem to be pretty immature, but it's kind of expected for the type of game. Overall, I think it's a great game to have. It's very fun to play with friends!

Theres lots of gamemodes to play which really suprised me. You can edit your playermodle and make your own servers just for you and your freinds,or you could just go in to singleplayer and build in sandbox. Some of the gamemodes you can do in this game are sandbox,roleplay,deathmatch,team deathmatch,jailbreak and much more.

This game came far before MineCraft and can do so much more than the blocky game.  It's the way Lego Universe should've been, and the free controls/make sense physics when building add so much more to the game.\nI picked up this game in 2010 with a recommendation from my friend, it by far is one of the best games I played.\nYou can have a creative outflow if thats what you wish or enjoy the creativity of others.

I've played this on and off since 2008. Aside from building, there is always something new.\n\nThe modding community is huge. Hell, the game practically revolves around it. Vanilla is nice, but any server you join is going to have lots of mods. From Team Deathmatches, to racing, to prison escapes, to building with some friends, there are many things to keep you busy.\n\nDevelopment is always active, and with the new launcher introduced in Version 19, they're applied automatically and more frequently. There are always new content updates and bug fixes every once and a while. It's been like this for years, and doesn't seem to be slowing down.\n\nThe graphics are good for a sandbox building game, but what more could you want right? Shadows and shaders have been a nice addition in Version 21, and anyone with a non-intergrated graphics card can at least run them on minimum. The game isn't very demanding at all. Aside from the studs, the bricks looks and act like your classic Lego blocks, and the minifigures have a nice, original design to them.\n\nIn a nuthshell, this game is practically G-Mod in the style of Legos. And it can't get any better than that. If you're still unsure, there's a demo you can download to try out the game and mechanics yourself - aside from multiplayer. For an indie game that only costs twenty-dollars, you get a lot more than your money's worth.","December 17, 2013","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Blockland is different in every aspect, foremost with the community. This game has no boundaries, especially with the use of mods. You cannot undermine this game for its lego-style approach, because beyond that you have unraveled limitless, unique possibilities that could be expressed through many game styles and modes. The well-sized and expanding community is helpful and the developer does a superb job at connecting with his players. As well, it features TorqueScript, an easy scripting language. It's super-cheap for its value!\n\nMy final premise on this title: This is an uncomparable, well-developed sandbox that is a definite must-buy for its pricing and community.\n\n","December 25, 2013","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The creator, Eric Hartman(A.K.A Badspot)May have made a wonderful game, but he's too lazy to fix any problems. He bans players off the forums for having such great ideas on improving the game. Overall, the online feature is WORSE. Theres tons of admin abusers, banning newcomers, banning anyone who they think is good enough to stay. Who cares if they are trustworthy? Anyhow, the servers like Tezuni's Prison escape, Boss battles Is possibly the bestest servers out there. With steam, you cant make dedicated servers, but you can play the game like if you had the paid from website edition, where you can make dedicated servers.\n\nI give this game 7/10, Great and fantastic sandbox game, but creator needs to pay attention to his game's bugs and his game a little more. -Engicop\n\n","May 10, 2015","true","024.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

One day i was hanging out with a friend and i showed him this game, and I asked my mom if i could get the full version. Well she said yes and needless to say i freaked out. Played it every day 24/7. Over the years I've gotten better, and better, maps were removed, shaders were added, RTB came and went, i got better and building and PVP, ect. There are many great addons, and many ♥♥♥♥. The community isn't always the nicest but there's always that one guy who is really nice and plays on everyone's server. I don't play it with steam, but I have atleast 3 thousand hours. I also bought it when it was 20 dollars. Ten? Way more than worth it. 100/10 R8ing, buy it now.

The best of this game is shaders. The shaders are amazing. Textures, qualites, physics and more. Building can be hard at first, but. Once you get ust to it, you might build good builds in the future. Blockland is mainly about building. Building anything you want, from a house to a school! And there are many ways to build, some are fast but less efficent, some are slow but very efficent. Another important thing is combat. You can battle your friends or Bots in your map or in another server. Another thing is Socializing, most servers have E-Tard List filters, that prevent people from saying U or anything else. And chat spam protection, where if you talk too much, Blockland will block you only for a few matter of time. There is also a trust feature, where you can send Trust Invites to build on your friends or other people's builds. You can also make objects in your home, interact with them and more. Making them more detailed and beautiful. Blockland also haves mini-games, where you can use those to create short or long mini-games to battle your friends in your sandbox server.","March 25","true","307.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It might not be because of steam nor version 21, but this game was my teenagehood and I still play it. This game would be my all time, top 5 favorite games of all time because this game is not a competetive game if you do not want it to be. You choose whatever you want to do, whenever you want, experiencing it with friends online or just play on your own time to yourself. You can add many interesting toold, features, decals, and more to spice up your games' features. You can add these weapons and tools made by your fellow community from the forums or ingame with the rtb client. Anyways, this game would strongly be recommended by me as this game makes me feel like I am not only building with legos, but creating the creations I have dreamt of since I was young.","January 23, 2014","true","143.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So BL is a building game first made in 2004 in the V0002 state, the retail version was then released in 2007 with the latest version being V21. Have you've ever played with LEGO's as a kid or built something with them? Did you ever have fun with them? If yes, then Blockland is the game for you. The game allows you to build with a virtually unlimted amount of bricks (There's a 256,000 brick limt,but you can set your own limt on your own server). It also even features an in-game eventing system that allows you to do cool stuff with your bricks like make a door that open and closes or a light switch. The modding community is also pretty good with a good number of brick packs, vehicles, colorsets, music, and etc. The community itself isn't the best, but there really isn't a perfect community out there anyway. You may meet some bad players here and there,but if you stay away from the bad side of the community you'll be fine. The graphics are very blocky and legolike giving a very nice look especially for a old 2003 engine.There are shaders in the game,but they look very jaggy and bad and they're also very poorly optimized at it too.If you want to there are modifications that can help you make the shadows look smoother,but you'll need a great PC to get it done.

To be very honest, I had loved Blockland so much before steam and the version 21 (if you know what version I am talking about, the one that has removed maps). It might not be because of steam nor version 21, but this game was my teenagehood and I still play it. This game would be my all time, top 5 favorite games of all time because this game is not a competetive game if you do not want it to be. You choose whatever you want to do, whenever you want, experiencing it with friends online or just play on your own time to yourself. You can add many interesting toold, features, decals, and more to spice up your games' features. You can add these weapons and tools made by your fellow community from the forums or ingame with the rtb client. Anyways, this game would strongly be recommended by me as this game makes me feel like I am not only building with legos, but creating the creations I have dreamt of since I was young.","January 23, 2014","true","143.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Removing interiors and terrain did sadden me, and I lost something that I was very familiar with, however I do not believe Blockland is headed in the wrong direction. Blockland still remains an infinite cesspool of ideas and fun, and although limited at first, the addition of addons as encouraged leaves for even more possibilities.

Its alot more than that.\n\nThis game opens alot of opportunites. You go on, click the join game button and see a list of at least 20 servers. Theres always plently of servers open. Prision Escape, Fort Wars, FreeBuild, CTF, Diesease, Murder Mystrey, Bot Wars, Role-play severs, Speedkart and Deathrace are all good examples. Some are modded, some arent. Another good part of the game is the mods are automatically downloaded.\n\nEdited in for popular demand: Minigames and eventing are amazing. Start up a mini game and make it the way you want. Turn the mini game to a capture the flag ot even a City RPG.\nEventing is even better. Event a brick so when you click on it, it plays a song or even tells you something. Make hidden rooms with disappering bricks, Make your bots look like you, Make traps so people fly into the air and so much more that i cant remember.\n\nSadly, on mac, It is a bit glitchy. You cant see any faces, when you start up the game it asks you to setup your settings and your player always resets.\n\nSingleplayer is mostly good for nothing, unless you have some fun mods or you just want to mess around with bots or something.\n\nIt is still the funnest game ive ever played in history of games ive played. EDIT: e.g. ive played 200 hours of it. (and none of my other games have come close to that.)\n\nMods are hard to get, there are some websites that have archives of the epic website, RTB. (that is closed)\n\nIn all its such a fun game, but there are a few sad reasons of not to get it. I'd reccomend it to people that like: sandbox, building, fps, loling, role-playing, zombies and tf2 like games!!","July 6, 2014","true","394.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","19"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheemo/recommended/250340/","cheemo","cheem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheemo/","193 products in account","Blockland is less of a game and more of a toolbox. It's definitely a sandbox more than it is anything else(don't believe what they tell you about 'adventure mode'!). It's a bit like Garry's Mod but a little more structured, if you've played that and would like a comparison. That being said, it's still incredibly fun even without mods or add-ons; the huge assortment of tools ready to be used allows for almost unlimited potential. It's almost intimidating how much you can do with this game. I don't have much playtime logged into Blockland on Steam because I played it for several years before it was greenlit, but I've played my own very generous(and unhealthy no doubt) portion of this game.\n\nSo what do you actually get? You get the ability to play as a(basically) Lego minifigure and build things. Or you can shoot things. Or you can program things in the packaged robust eventing system. There's an array of deep but simple mechanics that let you basically do anything. These features have been steadily piling on to Blockland over the years since its transition to retail some several years ago(about 8 or 9 I think). The creator, Eric Hartman(Badspot), has sandpapered off its rough edges and produced a fantastic package that's unrivalled in its scope. I'm a bit biased because I bought this game about 6 or 7 years ago and, for about 5 years, was completely absorbed by the game. Even then, it was crazy - it was something a 10 year old playing with Legos only dreamed about. Since then, it's come a long way.\n\nNow for what you actually get; the history of the game isn't really important in your purchase. Blockland has all the bricks, blocks, and colors you'd expect from what's effectively a virtual unlimited Lego set. There are bricks that play music, spawn vehicles, and whatever else you need can be done with the game's event system(more on that later). Those aren't an issue - pretty much any block you can imagine is there, and if it's not, well, someone's created it and has made it available as an add-on. I'll try to steer clear from mentioning specific add-on content, though, because while they are free and only add to the game, they're not part of the core game. Regardless, the assortment of building materials you have is no issue.\n\nYou control a small blocky person. In the default mode(sandbox) you can fly around with your jet-propelled feet. The camera functions fairly well; you're either in first person or third person. Third person view's got all the weird nuances of any third person camera, with the screen becoming a mess when backed against a wall and things behind you getting in the way, but for the most part, it's great. There are generally no issues with controls when you're building, which is what really matters. If you have a numpad, building is very easy and with some practice you'll be laying brick like a trained mason. I haven't used the control scheme without the numpad, so I can't speak for it. The options are great and have everything you'd expect a modern PC title to have - borderless windowed, windowed, resolutions, sound options, a huge array of graphical options; it's all there.\n\nThe multiplayer is one of the greatest parts of the game. The netcode is fantastic, and I can count the times I've seen the master server down with my fingers. Whatever add-ons the host of the server you're joining has that you don't will be downloaded partially - only what's needed to play on the server. Server administration is tiered - there are admins, super admins, and the host. The server host can change around their privileges. Hosting can be done with UPNP and direct IP connection is available, though it's usually easier to just join through the server browser. LAN is possible and is great fun. Blockland certainly handles multiplayer better than many AAA multi-million dollar titles I've played.\n\nYou can play with your friends on a passworded server or play on someone else's public server. Generally, people host when either they've created something they want people to experience or they just want to hang out. Your mileage with the community may vary. If you find a group of people that are fun to play with, stick with them. There are atrociously toxic people here like with any anonymous multiplayer game. In multiplayer, to build on or otherwise modify others' bricks, you need to ask for their "trust" - this can be given in two tiers: build and full trust. This is specific to each individual player. With build trust, you can only build on others' bricks; with full trust, you can destroy, paint, and event their bricks. While this is a fantastic way of keeping uncreative toxic players at bay, the really nasty ones will simply build around your bricks and make them inaccessible. This is easily preventable, however, with a swift kick or ban from the server.\n\nBlockland has a simple and robust programming system that, while being pretty easy to get into, allows for loads of creative mechanisms. Note that I'm not referring to the game's moddability - this part comes with Blockland. With your wrench tool, you can give bricks simple instructions that tell them how to react to certain things: when they're clicked on(activated), touched, or whatever else you can imagine. They can even be triggered by something called relays - these are basically when one brick "activates" an adjacent brick. The eventing system is very much like working with circuitboards, but without all the soldering and burnt fingers. These bricks can be modified to do basically anything. They can emit fire, play sounds, light up, mess with variables(for the more adventurous) and kill players. With some fiddling and hacky eventing, you can make yourself shoot bullets from your face whenever you walk sideways or you can make yourself a walking stereo and play annoying sound effects whenever you jump. If you've ever played with Lego NXT kits, they're very similar.\n\nIf you've got a taste for a more nitty gritty programming(that is, actually coding things) the game has unbelievable moddability. If you don't like something, you can change it(as long as it's within the realm of reason in the Torque engine). Programming is done in the Torque scripting language. It's fairly easy to work with. I haven't done much of this, but I've helped with mods that my friends and I have worked on in the past.\n\nThe community is, again, filled with a wide variety of people. Some of them nasty, some not. The most popular servers are generally some kind of RP, but in my opinion these places are not where the game shines. The game shines most when you and a group of friends work on something together. If you want the most bang for your buck, make sure your friends play this game with you and make something together.\n\nIf you like Legos and sandbox games you will like this game. This game can be a solid first person shooter or it can be a more compelling virtual Lego designer. At such a low price point, it's a steal - you're getting much more in the package than you would with a standard sandbox game.\n\nTL;DR: Blockland is a great and unique sandbox building game. If you want to make something with your friends, very few games come even close to Blockland. However, it can feel a bit dull if you don't get hooked into the game's building or eventing(simplified programming, basically). If you enjoy building things with Legos and you think programming or circuitry are cool, you'll love Blockland.","June 26, 2014","true","27.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I gotta say, this is actually quite a fun sandbox game.

Sure! Why not?\n\nAlthough, there are 2 downsides to the game. One, is that some of the controls feel a bit akward. (The good side though is that you do get used to it after awhile. Still, it feels werid to me atleast.) Second, the graphics don't look... all that great (even if you have the shaders on MAX.)\n\nOverall, this is a really fun sandbox game and I highly recommend it. Even though some of the controls are a bit akward and the graphics aren't that good. It's still a good game. And if you have any friends on here, it's a great mutliplayer experince. Their is also other gamemodes as well. Such as SpeedKarts, Deathmatch, and so on. So if you don't wanna be sandboxing all day you could just play those as well. Good game, fun experince.

Sure I had some times where things didn't go well for me playing this game, but I was always able to pull through my problems in the game. I loved every single bit of detail coming from maps (back in V20 and below), shaders and shadows, and every single mod that was created from global Blockland players from around the world. I've made great friends, and introduced friends to this game, they loved it very much as well. Also thanks to this game, I went from not only just a player of this game, I went to a person who's really addicted to this game, and can't stop playing. I also finally learned how to make mods in certain categories too! Everyone loves the mods that i've made too.\n\nBadspot, you've done a very well done on making and progressing this game to satisfaction!

Instead, you start in an empty world with only your imagination. Players use bricks to construct anything they desire. Houses, castles, spaceships, anything you can think of. The only real limit is the brickcount, which i believe is around 1,000,000 bricks at once. Unless you're some hardcore extreme builder, you'll never hit this limit and you'll be free to build anything you want without worrying about running out of bricks(a common problem found with real life legos).\n\nIf you don't like building alone, it's very easy to set up a server and have friends join the fun. You could even enter a public freebuild server and hangout there.Building not you're style? That's alright, this game has multiple gamemodes aka multiple ways of playing the game. Challenge some friends to a kart race, or join a deathmatch server and show off your mad MLG no-scoping skills. Team up with other players to defeat a powerful boss. Escape from prison while avoiding police brutality. Enter a city rp, empires rp, slave rp,or, everyone's favorite roleplay, the family rp. If none of that sounds interesting, you could always try to make your own gamemode and contribute to the community.\n\nSpeaking of communtity content, the blockland forums is filled with countless amounts of add ons and new content to spice up your game. Download some new weapons, get a new car, fly a stunt plane. If you're a builder, there's tons of custom bricks and tools to make building easier and more fun.\n\nA lot of reviews here seem to warn you about the game's community to some extent. I'll be honest, there are some pretty bad people in the game, particlularly on the forums. However there are lots of cool people aswell to meet in game and on the forums, and that's not so bad.\n\nTHE VERDICT:\n\nI spent $20 on this game before it's steam release, and probably have 500 hours on that version. Now it's only $10, so it's even more worth it. And when it goes on sale, you should have no reason not to buy this wonderful game.\n\nSo, why are you reading this review and not buying/playing this game?

First off, I saw this game around its older and more golden years. I saw the mods, the weapons, the missions, the GUI features and the many things that the community were throwing in and everyone was loving it! I wanted Blockland. Badly. Unfortunately, I could not get it until its Steam release. But only now as I buy this, I find out that RTB is closing down and maps have been removed. This was a huge disappointment to me and those who wanted to play alone at their free will and explore and do missions that people would create. Now, don't get me wrong. This game is awesome and a ton of fun. But its strongest hole is the bad timing of things I wanted to try like everyone else around its golden age. Steam, I can only pray and hope that you will return a better community that are worthy to make the perfect addons. Again, this is much like the same issue Garry's mod had. When I saw Gmod, it looked amazing and fantastic. I played Gmod 12 and loved it all. That was when at the very cut second Gmod 13 was released and I lost that feature. Blockland....Please don't fail like Gmod did. Just do what everyone else wants. Addons and maps again. That is all I want. Other then that, this game is worth getting if you love to have a lot of freedom. But if you are one who has seen Blockland in its older ages before the steam release, you are likely better off waiting but if you want, its likely worth it to buy this anyways for the simple fact of its fun little multiplayer servers.","March 7, 2014","false","39.1"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Before I start this off, I'd like to address the 1,000 hours thing. Most of my hours are from either from me leaving the game open for my friends (partially due to the fact that blockland on steam has no dedicated support, and lacking a client made me deal with doing this for a bit), dealing with my friends playing this game, or actually enjoying 1-2 gamemodes that are put out on the game that are pretty much non existent now. I have a love hate relationship with this game, you can make something done so well, working through the games pretty dated limitations, to be utterly destroyed by the community in any way possible, because if one problem is apparent, then everyone will try to exploit and break the system you've created. I mean sure that can go for everything, right? Well not like how the community treats it. You're the bad guy if the system is partially flawed, not the people actively trying to break your system. I have been on the fence of making this review for a good 6 months or so, mostly due to how I feel about the game and the community as said from above.\n\nOh, I know you! You're that jerk on the forum who hosted that one server!\nI don't think I want to host it ever again with how the community lashed out at me, it doesn't matter if I'm the victim at this point, here's my reasoning for why I say this: If you look at the previous works with my friends, I'm not involved, I'm not claiming to make everything, I'm trying to stay away from the spotlight because I outright don't deserve it. That's why I'm not the poster for these things, I'm not handling hosting an the event, and I'm not in charge of most of what's happening. I'm not in charge of any of this ♥♥♥♥ other than posting updates (which I didn't even do entirely), the formatting for threads, and music for our events. I don't want to pin the blame on others, because they don't deserve it, but this was outrageous. Now, during the event one of our events broke, spamming music. You know what we had to do? Restart the server. Oh, it's a tragedy, right? How dare we restart the server because something I HAD NO CONTROL OVER, broke. You know what happens then? a good 50+ people start collectively ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on me when again, I HAD NO CONTROL OVER IT. I had blame pinned on me for no reason, and the community is downright ignorant.\n\nOh, but you act like a prick!!\nI don't want to take part in the community for the most part anymore, if I ever go on the game again it's because of my friends motives, and anything I do towards the community I do if I really feel like it's needed. I'm not saying my actions back in the past are justified because I hate the image I made for myself, but if nobody is willing to give me even a chance to act like a competent person then why even try? If I come back under a different name, people will find who I am and continue ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on me for something I did. It's not even worth my time, either. I don't want to deal with a community that actively attacks people in and outside of the community if they have a disability, I don't want associate with a community that acts this awful towards people, it's petty. I understand  I haven't been the best person around in the community, but even if I decided to change, nobody would give a ♥♥♥♥. It's easier to act like a ♥♥♥♥ back unprovoked and act ignorant because that would get someone banned faster.\n\nWhat do you mean 1-2 gamemodes you've enjoyed? Wouldn't you recommend the game for that?\nI have 1,000 hours on this game, I've played a majority the game has to offer, and I'm not going to be the generic "the game isn't fun anymore" type of person. You have to actively sift through the ♥♥♥♥ on the master list to find games that are actually enjoyable, and a good 90% of the time there's nothing to offer. By the chance there is something fun to play, the community again attacks whatever me or my friends do because we're a group of like 6-7 people at a time. You know, because that many people is threatening and if we have power that one person has to constantly annoy us because they want to "join us" and mess everything up, and when they don't get their way they throw a ♥♥♥♥♥ fit and attack us whenever they can. This has happened so many times it's just outright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I'm sick and tired of this happening constantly.\n\nIf you hate the community, why have you been apart of it for so long?\nI have just outright tolerated it, but it has been the forum that has kept a lot of people towards the game for awhile, and getting off of it has been a hard time, but finally saying I don't want anything to do with that place anymore feels welcoming due to how awful the community can be sometimes. Toleration doesn't mean that I like it, though. I have just put up with the community, nothing more, nothing less until recently.\n\nWhat do you mean limited?\nThe game came out like 10 years ago, the game is limited and has not had a big update in what, two years? What's there to play for? Nothing will be new and the community isn't treating the game that well either.\n\nOne mistake? How so?\nThe game is overall broken, there is so much broken to the point of where you can get out of maps that you have built. For example, you build something in a cube format, you can glitch and jump out through the walls and has never been fixed. You have to use zonebricks as a solution to this, and the downside to that? No water bricks. The game is also very very broken. If you sat down to play speedkart for an hour, I assure you that you have been shot away by the awful physics at least 5 times at a minimum. You have to work in the games awful limitations, and fix the games awful problems to manage to host one thing decent, mess up something or don't lock it down fully? Don't expect your server up for more than an hour.\n\nTo conclude, I think the community does not play good service for the game, and I can tell you first hand that a good majority of the people in game are less than pleasant. Now that doesn't mean everyone is bad, there are some people that are actually worth talking to, but it's a minority.","May 30","false","299.1"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","53","8","15","4","4"

The maps you may see in other trailers are actually outdated ones from before v21 which removed the maps but replaced the game with awesome shadows and shaders.\n\nFor those who couldn't read my huge wall of text, I just want to point out the fact you should just shut up and click the Add to Cart button.

Badspot made something awesome here. I can start the game up and go on a server and have fun instantly. No matter the gamemode. Racing in carts is fun. Mining for hours just to get a good pickaxe is fun. Sniping other players is fun. The entire game is fun, heck, building pixel art of Mario and putting the fire emitters on it is cool to see.\n\nThe whole concept of the game is really awesome. It's easy to mod, it's easy to have fun, and it's not expensive. I got the game for $2.49 while it was on sale and I wish I would have bought it for it's full price. Building in an online enviroment has never given me as much freedom as this game does. Think building with LEGO's online.\n\nThe community here is outstanding. They practically make the game. There's tons of mods, tons of minigames, an acceptable amount of servers with nice, friendly people. Well, usually the people are friendly. There are some badmins out there and just plain rude people out there but it's the internet so thats not very surprising.\n\nThe game isn't updated much anymore though, but oh well. What we have here is a cool little game you can have hours of fun on. Although it isn't as popular as it was before, Blockland stands out to me as one the funniest times I've had playing a game with friends and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves building stuff and letting their imagination flow.","March 22, 2014","true","84.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can literally do anything you want here--there are City RPGs, Freebuilds, Deathmatches, Mini Empires...all sorts of things. This is the LEGO game there never was. A multitude of mods make the game have the capability to host many different types of game modes that only need your brain to think up something good--there are even servers out there that you play on these floating platforms in the sky with only a grappling hook and a knife.\n\nThe game used to have all sorts of terrain and buildings that you could play in, but with v28 those have been (sadly) removed. They were replaced with shaders which can really make the game look pretty, but if your computer can't handle them (most can handle them on medium at least), it's kind of a moot point.\n\nIf you like playing building games with friends and want to get your creative juices flowing, get this game.","June 19, 2014","true","284.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Be it a city, battlefield, island paradise, race track, sculptures, sports stadiums, landmarks, etc... or you can make your own server with tons of gamemodes including TDM, FFA, Zombie Survival, Death Run, Roleplay, City Roleplay, and even Family Roleplay... if you're in to that.

People will tell you the problem with this is the building system and truthfully you just need to get use to numb pad. Its the 3rd part in learning how to plant bricks in the tutorial where you put it in the small hole (that's what she said hehe) but really mastering numb pad is key to building and in-fact, makes it easier than most games since if you miss you can just press a button to move it in place. I am a builder and I am proud. I highly suggest you buy this game since its the game that keeps on giving. I have played for 5 years and I shall go another 5.\n\nP.S. if you feel like a reason not to get this game is the community remember the steam community will become the majority so all problems found in it will practically cease to exist.\n\nP.S.S.

However is recent years Badspot decided to remove the maps in exchange for enhance graphics and shaders. Despite the fact that I loved map, especially bedroom, it was a welcome change for me as I could now build on an unlimited scale. And, I've noticed some people say that there is stuff like a vehicle, bot, and a brick limit. Now this is mostly seen on the demo version of the game and these limits in the full version can be changed in the server settings before you start your server. Anyways, probably one of the best sandbox games I've ever seen, and I would love to see its community grow greatly. Who knows, maybe in years to come we might get RTB and maps added back into the game.

Blockland is a fun do what you want sand box.You can build your own house a car live the dream with some lemonade ;) ! But beware! If you make a house on anothers server you may never get it back. It happened to me and my friend.Third of all theirs adventure of course.My favorite adventure servers is KONGS deathrace,The black parrots falling platforms,and dogfights.Kongs server is ,cars racing to the endyou have a temate or none and you try to kill your oponet or try to win by driving to the house in both maps.The black parrots falling platforms is ,jumping around colors and rockets shot at you but you cant be color blind and you have to read to know wich color to stand on.Then dogfights :) you drive planes and helicopters KILL eachother and capture bases ! :D\nSo i do think blockland is an amazing game but please do not buy this if your realy  young .BUT  if you need help just go to badspot they run it all.

Badspot made something awesome here. I can start the game up and go on a server and have fun instantly. No matter the gamemode. Racing in carts is fun. Mining for hours just to get a good pickaxe is fun. Sniping other players is fun. The entire game is fun, heck, building pixel art of Mario and putting the fire emitters on it is cool to see.\n\nThe whole concept of the game is really awesome. It's easy to mod, it's easy to have fun, and it's not expensive. I got the game for $2.49 while it was on sale and I wish I would have bought it for it's full price. Building in an online enviroment has never given me as much freedom as this game does. Think building with LEGO's online.\n\nThe community here is outstanding. They practically make the game. There's tons of mods, tons of minigames, an acceptable amount of servers with nice, friendly people. Well, usually the people are friendly. There are some badmins out there and just plain rude people out there but it's the internet so thats not very surprising.\n\nThe game isn't updated much anymore though, but oh well. What we have here is a cool little game you can have hours of fun on. Although it isn't as popular as it was before, Blockland stands out to me as one the funniest times I've had playing a game with friends and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves building stuff and letting their imagination flow.","March 22, 2014","true","84.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I've loved this game and it's been basically the backbone of my internet career. You can literally do anything you want here--there are City RPGs, Freebuilds, Deathmatches, Mini Empires...all sorts of things. This is the LEGO game there never was. A multitude of mods make the game have the capability to host many different types of game modes that only need your brain to think up something good--there are even servers out there that you play on these floating platforms in the sky with only a grappling hook and a knife.\n\nThe game used to have all sorts of terrain and buildings that you could play in, but with v28 those have been (sadly) removed. They were replaced with shaders which can really make the game look pretty, but if your computer can't handle them (most can handle them on medium at least), it's kind of a moot point.\n\nIf you like playing building games with friends and want to get your creative juices flowing, get this game.","June 19, 2014","true","284.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Another thing I like is the amount of bricks and objects you get, you get quite alot, more if you use the custom gamemode.

First of all, there is a rival between this game, minecraft, and roblox, mostly about what came first, and what is worse or better. Well, Minecraft, came out in 2009, and is pretty bland. Roblox, the game everyone hates, came out in around 2006? Blockland started developing in 2005, and was released around 2007. And this game is still amazing. Now the community has gotten a bit bad after Steam kicked in, but its still the same game. V21 has changed it all. People say they hate it, but everyone wanted it. You all got what was coming. The game was great before shaders, and its even better. Its unfortunate they couldn't keep maps (because they glitched with shaders), so the first trailer they made is false advertising. But their updated one shows its true glory. Sure, there is no environment, no terrain, no maps.

This game has a great community which manages to produce great projects and creations regularly, despite the small player base. Sure there's trolls, but they only affect you if you let them, you know?\n\nThere's a small learning curve to start building, but if you've played with LEGO bricks in your life you'll know what to do once you get the controls down. Once you get a hang of building, you will discover that eventing (using the wrench tool) opens up a whole new level of gameplay and really seperates this game from other LEGO-esque building games.\n\nYou can also spice up your game with amazing mods that are available on the Blockland Forums. I highly recommend checking that out if you play Blockland, seriously.\n\nIf you're not a creator, you can still enjoy other people's games that they create within Blockland. I personally enjoy adventure servers and deathmatches, but there's many of other gamemodes to enjoy.\n\nPROS:\nGood Building Mechanics\nGraphics\nEventing\nWeapons\nEnvironmental Controls\nMods allow for customization\nGamemodes\nGame has aged well\n\nCONS:\nSteep learning curve\nVehicles are wonky\nThere's not a lot of players\nSometimes things get dramatic in the community\n\nOVERALL: 9/10\n\n","March 2","true","134.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

First of all, there is a rival between this game, minecraft, and roblox, mostly about what came first, and what is worse or better. Well, Minecraft, came out in 2009, and is pretty bland. Roblox, the game everyone hates, came out in around 2006? Blockland started developing in 2005, and was released around 2007. And this game is still amazing. Now the community has gotten a bit bad after Steam kicked in, but its still the same game. V21 has changed it all. People say they hate it, but everyone wanted it. You all got what was coming. The game was great before shaders, and its even better. Its unfortunate they couldn't keep maps (because they glitched with shaders), so the first trailer they made is false advertising. But their updated one shows its true glory. Sure, there is no environment, no terrain, no maps.

You can build a house, a building, or even a castle! You can also build with friends! Besides building, you can also play different types of gamemodes like Garry's Mod! Like, for instance, a racing gamemode, and Deathmatches!\n\nThis game is highly recommended and should be cherrished for the rest of their lives! :)","March 16, 2014","true","7.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
