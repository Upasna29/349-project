"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/233270/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Far Cry 3 - Blood Dragon is an 80s sci-fi parody, with childish humor and old school gun play mechanics, similar to the likes of Duke Nukem or Serious Sam.\n\nThe gameplay is virtually identical to Far Cry 3, all the same controls, weapons just have different skins. The stealth side of Blood Dragon is very key. You find your self having to stalk around dinosaurs in order to reach objectives, along with the regular stalking through bases to switch off alarm systems etc. I personally like to play Far Cry as stealthy as possible and then go gung-ho with weapons once I inevitably get caught. I really enjoyed using the bow and arrow in Blood Dragon, more so than in Far Cry 3, maybe it was because it has a cool bluey glow effect! Another nice addition, since you are a human cyborg, you no longer take fall damage. There is a hunting side to be found here too, b ut not as in depth as Far Cry 3, its merely there for an achievement purpose from what I could see.\n\nGraphics wise, we are looking at another re-skin of Far Cry 3, everything in Blood Dragon is darker and has the sci-fi look to it, with lots of glowing,  shinny, and metallic looking objects.\n\nThe main story is full of cheesy one liners and plot twists, but still has a convincing and interesting story line to want to play it. If you were to purchase Blood Dragon just for the story alone, you will probably be disappointed.\n\nThis is another open world, it does a couple of things differently to Far Cry 3 though. First of all, without wanting to spoil too much, there are tons of hidden Easter eggs found throughout the map that will give you a good chuckle. The map size it self is a little bit bigger than the first island you find yourself on in FC3, Sadly it lacks a little depth here, unlike in FC3, you  can't find many hidden secrets which reveal more about the story and characters,\n\nThis is one of the few games that I have actually found my self playing through for a second time. My first playthrough done on normal mode, and second on harder mode. This added to the replay ability for me. You can also spend a lot of time working on (dirty) uPlay achievements, although some may not find this as attractive as Steam achievements, which is something Far Cry 3 and Blood Dragon miss. You can if you work hard enough and plan things out, reach about 80% of completing the game fully on your first playthrough, alot will be time consuming though, be warned.\n\nMy first play through was finished in six or seven hours or so, this was completing all of the side missions as well as a little achievement gathering. Sadly it seems a little short for what you are paying, but all of the other aspects of the game make up for it.\n\nFinal thoughts on Blood Dragon, well, I would recommend people pick it up. The game brings back fun into a game without sacrificing core gameplay. I had fun playing from beginning to end. When you do complete Blood Dragon, it will leave you wanting more.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

If you really can't get it working there's enough help on the internet that it shouldn't remain a problem for you.\n\n"requires too much stealth" - how did you even come to that conclussion?? I spent the first hour of this game blowing stuff up and shooting people point blank in the face with a shotgun (the only reason I started using stealth was to get more exp). If you can't play like a man that's your fault not the game's.\n\n"penalises you for stealth" - what, by giving you more exp? By stopping dragons from seeing you if you're crouched allowing you to evade them with ease?? Did you even play the game!?!?\n\n"exactly like farcry3 with less customisation" - okay 1) blood dragon was just some fun thrown together by the developers so you could HAVE FUN. It's not a new game or even a full game so don't expect it to be. 2) the game takes care of your level-up perks so you can focus on killing things with lasers. Also while on the topic of customisation you can get a quadbarrelled shotgun that shoots incendiary rounds and a sniper rifle that shoots explosive rounds.......enough said.","November 13, 2014","true","10.1"," 174 of 196 people (89%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","89","174","196","43","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/recommended/233270/","geoluz","GeoLuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/","180 products in account","I describe Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon as a cheesy take on famous sci-fi and action films of the 1980s. It purposely reminds you of famous films like Terminator, Die Hard, Commando, Predator, Robocop, and Rocky IV. Being cheesy doesn’t mean it’s not fun at all. It is actually quite a lot of fun to play in the permanently neon environments. The protagonist is Rex Colt, whose voiceover is played by actor Michael Biehn from the 1984 Terminator movie. Rex is a cyber-commando with a cybernetic left hand and a human right hand. He regularly comes up with one-liners after kills and after his data console tells him what his next objective is.\n\nThe cut scenes play out in 8-bit and 16-bit form like a VHS tape whereas the gameplay is in modern 3D. The soundtrack is outstanding as it is from Power Glove and it genuinely sounds like ‘80s music. The gameplay will feel very familiar to Far Cry 3 players since the control scheme is the same and the ability to take over territory is the same. The outposts in Far Cry 3 are referred to as garrisons in Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. Rex’s killer moves such as death from above and death from below feel very much the Jason Brody’s moves from Far Cry 3. However, there is no such thing as taking damage from any falls since Rex is a cybernetic guy. The main antagonist, Sloan, strongly resembles Bennett from the movie Commando starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. The weapons you possess are the handgun, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper rifle, all with attachments that you can acquire as you progress. Later you will have access to the bow, a chaingun, and proximity mines. Those with experience with Far Cry 3 will feel at home playing Blood Dragon. The island has random battles between scientists who are part of your faction and members of the Omega Force.\n\nBlood Dragons are an integral part of the game and they appear all over the map. They’re quirky in that they fire lasers from their eyes. These dragons are powerful and take a lot of bullets to kill but you can lure them to cyber hearts that you can throw near them so that you can attack them while they’re eating cyber hearts. Cyber hearts are the hearts of the Omega Force soldiers that you can collect after killing them.\n\nThere are still cool RPG elements similar to those in Far Cry 3. For every kill you earn cybernetic points that help you level up Rex. The RPG aspect of the game is simpler than it is in Far Cry 3, but it’s still fun to apply. Therefore, it would be wise to take on the side missions such as hostage rescues and hunting down special animals for leveling up and for earning attachments for the weapons.\n\nThe environments do feel a bit monotonous since it always feels like night and the neon lights are the same. There doesn’t seem to be a day-night cycle at any time as you progress through the story. This game contains a lot of quirkiness paying homage to the 1980s. It’s not as fun as the classic Far Cry 3, but it’s still worth playing.","November 9, 2014","true","27.7"," 93 of 100 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","93","100","3","1"

It feels like a blend of Tron, Terminator, and a typical 80's action movie wrapped into the Far Cry island.  At the same time, the game parodies modern games with simple repetitive missions and a long, mandatory tutorial that your character complains about while you do it.\n\nThe game is a lot of fun, though I'm glad it's a small title.  The nostalgia trip only gets you so far and certain things like looting corpses gets tiring by repeating the same long animation every time.  The bad 80's action hero one-liners get quite tiring after a while too.\n\nIt took me about 8 hours to complete everything available in the game, which I think is pretty reasonable for the price and a good length for this sort of game.  Any longer and I don't think I'd want to finish it, though at this length it is quite enjoyable.  If you think you'd enjoy the nostalgia trip or just want some more open world fps action, this is definitely a good title to pick up.","July 4, 2013","true","9.4"," 85 of 94 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","85","94","0","0"

I really could get used to that.Fans of Far Cry 3 should not miss this fantastic experience, and anyone who grew up watching films like Terminator, Aliens and Commando owe it to themselves to play this, as it was certainly crafted by people who understand the culture.This game is pure irony: story, dialogue, music, graphics... everything recalls the craziest clichés of the 80s.Blood Dragon is a reminder that a story about one man killing thousands is just silly.

It's well aware its a game and can suit quick pick up and play action or longer play sessions as you clear out outposts, hunt wildlife or just cause on the fly chaos. One drawback is the number of enemies, in many cases there just seems to be too few that even the largest of outposts can be cleared in under a minute...but it is usually a fun minute!\n\nIf Far Cry 3 was a decent bottle of wine, Blood Dragon would be a few pints and a lot of shots. It may be a reduced game at a reduced price, but its not reduced the fun to be had. It's a more distilled Far Cry 3 experience that will suit both FPS fans that have yet to play Far Cry 3 and those that have, but want more of the same with some 80's flair on top.","July 5, 2014","true","9.4"," 64 of 73 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","64","73","0","1"

The main campaign is only about 4 hours but there are plenty of collectables to extend the playtime. As well as what has become something of an expectation, outpost takeovers. Upon liberating those outposts you'll unlock a side mission or two. Consisting of a hostage rescue or hunting specific animals with a specific weapon type affairs.\n\nIts pretty strait forward, its enjoyable. Its Far Cry. One complaint I have with the game is that it is way too red, I realize it was an aesthetic choice but its kind of over powering.\n\nIt feels as good if not better than other Far Cry games, however the main character is kind of a show off and does a lot of flipping guns and spinny junk which looks really cool but when you're looting corpses or switching weapons in the heat of battle it can get a little annoying.\n\nIt has some genuine laughs, Ubisoft poking itself for collectables “I hope I don't have to collect any feathers” The cut-scenes are also a throwback and done in a rather decent pixel art style.\n\nOne aspect I really enjoy due to the games length is everything regarding character progression is sped up. No hunting a number of animals for their skin to expand wallet size or weapon holsters. Most abilities are unlocked immediately but still leaves room for more progression. Fall damaged is removed which is nice, movement speed is also much faster to the point where I never even bothered getting into a vehicle.\n\nIts nice to see Ubisoft do weird things like this instead of delving into the money machine with their cookie cutter prowess (Not that that's inherently a bad thing) Its also nice to see Ubisoft turn criticism into something fun; giving us, the players, a nod that they have heard you.","December 23, 2015","true","8.9"," 52 of 59 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","52","59","5","0"

The interface is reminiscent of the\ncodec from "Metal Gear Solid", and Rex Colt's\nCyber-Commando program is less than a\nthinly veiled analogue to both "Terminator" and\n"Universal Soldier".\n\nThe soundtrack is to die for, transporting you\nback to the heyday of your childhood, eating\nbread and ice cream with your grandparents\non lazy weekdays waiting for your parents to\ncome home from work, grade school amid the\nglare of sci-fi laser fire and superhuman heroes,\nand finally to the closing of your adolescence\nwhere your life changed with your path crossing\nMs. Novocaine's.

Set in the year 2007, this is the future that 1980s action movies foretold. Blood Dragon is an open world, first person shooter that lets you tackle situations how you want. Do you sneak up behind someone for a silent stealth kill? Snipe? Go in guns blazing or set traps? Its up to you. The enemies try their best to flank you. The outside world and indoor compounds have open rooms where you and the enemies can jockey for cover. The world itself is dark, like permanent night. The compounds, soldiers and vehicles are all highlighted with neon lights. Even your knife.\n\nI would like to say right now, Blood Dragon needs UPlay and it comes with UPlay, but not the UPlay you need. The forum is full of complaints about UPlay. You need to uninstall the version that comes with the game, visit their website, install the current version. Register with UPlay. Then have it and Steam open, register Blood Dragon with UPlay BEFORE you can play it. Once its registered with UPlay, you can play it offline. It worked for me and took me an hour trying to figure it out. So if that's a deal breaker, now you know.\n\nOn the island, there are a lot of things going on. Omega Force is your enemy and there are scientists that are your friends. You'll come across them fighting out in the open. Its good to see the factions interacting. There is also exotic wild life that doesn't care who you are. The aggressive ones will attack anything. Cyber sharks, crocodiles, some sort of mutant emu and of course the giant blood dragons. These blood dragons are massive and covered in neon phosphorescent light. When they're passive, its green, spooked, yellow and hostile, red. You can rip out a dead soldier's cyber heart and use it as bait to lure the blood dragons. Not just that, but the cyber hearts prevent them from shooting lasers. While its interesting to see, I think I can kill a lot quicker than the dragons.\n\nControls are like other first person shooters. Walk, unlimited run, look, aim weapon, shoot, weapon wheel, melee / stealth kill, jump, quick weapon switch between two weapons. Throw something, throw dice to distract an enemy, hold for health, reload and your cyber eye. The cyber eye lets you zoom in and out along with mark targets. With targets marked, you see them even when they're hiding. Its helpful, but you can also tag them just by aiming at them. You can only hold four weapons at a time, with all the throwable types, making for eight weapons. There is a sniper rifle, machine gun, short range shot gun, Robocop style machine gun pistol, chain gun, bow for stealth kills and flame thrower. Enemies have ammo, but its more efficient to find a vending machine that sells it. The machines also have maps, health and body armor. There's even a quick way to fully replenish your ammo for a price. Money becomes over abundant, you'll have so much.\n\nThere are a few types of enemies, standard soldiers that you'll hear talk with their robo-voices. Snipers, molotov throwers to light the world on fire. Flame throwing incinerators, heavy armored chain gunners, attack dogs and later on, "running dead" that attack anything around them. They only die from headshots. Enemies will run for alarms if you don't disable them and the area will flood with more soldiers. The enemy intelligence is good that I feel like that's all there needed to be. Soldiers can take hold of turrets. Molotovs can light themselves on fire. There is the occasional grenade too. I ended up just melee killing everyone. Flame throwing soldier? No problem, stabbed 4 times. It got to the point where they'd literally run away from me when I'd run to them to stab. You can always regenerate your health, so why not? You'll get notified how close you are to getting seen and if enemies are alert to your presence.\n\nThe main missions are entertaining and offer enough first person diversity to keep it interesting. Hang gliding, driving a jeep out of an exploding building, turret sections, frying dragon eggs with a flame thrower, waiting for an elevator straight out of an Aliens movie. The main mission took me under 8 hours on medium, but I feel like I only scratched the surface. The main missions will have you 'liberating garrisons' and you can liberate more than the game demands. Once liberated, they become spawn points when you die. If you try to leave the mission area, it will warn you that you'll fail.\n\nThere are side missions that reward you with weapon upgrades. After the first side mission, I stuck with the main missions. Side missions like rescue a hostage, where any wrong move, the half dozen commandos will kill the hostage. Plus there are others that have you hunting wild animals. See it doesn't sound difficult, until you factor in the randomness. While hunting something, suddenly a jeep drives by and starts shooting you, then scientist run up and capture the jeep, then the emu begins chasing you only to get attacked by a blood dragon. All while the field is on fire from a molotov cocktail.\n\nMichael Bein lends his voice to Sargent Rex "Power" Colt, a cyber commando and with a name like that, you can expect over the top 1980s action. So far over the top that for the first few hours I didn't see it as funny or entertaining. They're so over the top that it doesn't get to the so bad its good realm. I just keep thinking wow they're trying hard. I've heard far too many, "Remember the time we (adverb) (country) from (country)?" I feel bad for Michael Bien for having to put up with whoever wrote the script. Its not a parody of 80s action movies, its a mockery of video games. I'll be honest and say anyone could have done this gravel voice, but Michael Bein lends 80s star power.\n\nTo start the game and to end each main mission, you'll see a retro style cut scene. Its got a great art style, but these feel a lot longer than they need to be, because of the voice acting. You can always skip them. While the style is great, its just cheaper than having in game cut scenes for a $15 game.\n\nNow for the bad stuff. As I mentioned before, UPlay was a pain, but more than that its the little things. The smallest step or height difference would block me 90% of the time unless I jumped. This even included the bottom of staircases. I fell through the world while inside a compound. Pilfering bodies has its own animation and pilfering 30 dead bodies just takes way too long from big room to big room. Loading a saved game doesn't put you at the last checkpoint, it puts you at the start of the mission. The hit detection for the blood dragons was pretty awful. They'd be far away and still hit me. Grass sometimes isn't attached to the hills. I felt like the game ran out of ideas for main story missions and just threw me into a horde mode.\n\nWith all that said, the final mission was might be the highest point of any game that I've ever played. As unmoved by the comedy as I was the entire game, it just clicked for me. I enjoyed the hilarity of the final hour. The cut scene before the final mission, feeling powerful for the final mission, the surprise dragon ride at the end. Even though the game ended without a boss battle, I was still highly entertained.\n\nIts a solid sandbox first person shooter. I can forgive its flaws. Its a unique world, but I don't want to stay in. I prefer daytime and environments other than black and neon lights. They do a good job of recreating scenes from movies and that final hour was incredible.","January 9, 2015","true","7.8"," 45 of 52 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","45","52","3","0"

The 80s, specifically 80s action movies, with their simple no-nonsense plot lines about badass dudes saving the world from ultimate destruction, with synth heavy rock blaring in the background and explosions around every corner. Remember those? Blood Dragon definitely does, in fact it does such a good job of paying homage while simultaneously parodying them that it almost feels like it's a recently unearthed time capsule, built with technology far ahead of its time and hidden until the public was ready for it. That time is now; Blood Dragon is here and it's flipping sweet!\n\nAs Sargent Rex "Power" Colt, former army vet killed and then brought back to life Robocop style as a superhuman cyborg, it's up to you to put a stop to the tyrannical plot of your former commander, who plans to harness the blood of the cyber dragon to bring about a new age for humanity no matter the costs. The plot is cheesy, over the top, full of outrageous one liners and more explosions than a Michael Bay film, and outrageously fun for all of it. I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard playing a game as with Blood Dragon, which perfectly nails the balance between self aware cheese and playing up the ridiculousness of itself.\n\nAnd of course, Blood Dragon plays exactly how you'd expect, by which I mean to say it makes you feel like the incredible cyber soldier that you are, liberating the remote supernatural island bit by bit as you pop off robots, save the helpless nerds, and face off against cyber dragons (essentially giant dragons that shoot lasers out of their eyes). For a budget game, Blood Dragon is surprisingly expansive, with the island being surprisingly large and chock full of side missions, collectibles, and cyber animals for you to hunt. It's not on the level of Far Cry 3 proper, but the size feels perfect for the sort of game it's trying to be, without any bloat and a fantastic ending which I won't spoil but is one of my favorites of any game in years.\n\nIf I was going to nitpick, my biggest complaint would be that the constant darkness contrasting with the neon color palette can be rather hard on the eyes after awhile, making this a game best played in short bursts if you don't want to go into self induced blindness. Other minor issues arise with the somewhat weak gunplay and the difficulty of trying to maneuver any vehicle around the island (I eventually gave up driving and just sprinted to my destination) can be bothersome at times, but never made enough of an impact to lessen my enjoyment.\n\nBlood Dragon is a game designed to allow you to relive the glory days of silly action movies, updated with modern sensibilities to be nothing but unadulterated fun. It doesn't take itself the slightest bit seriously, and focuses all its energy into building itself up as a love letter to nonsensical action and soundtracks that you can't help but love (the music might be the best thing in the game, period). As long as you don't go into it expecting anything deeper than "kill the bad guy" and take it for what it is, Blood Dragon will shower you in it self indulging awesomeness and have you begging for more.","August 6, 2014","true","8.9"," 40 of 46 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","40","46","0","3"

Now some People get mad at the fact that you have to play this game through Uplay rather than just only through steam. That's not really a Big deal considering most Ubisoft games are through Uplay now days, Exspecially the good ones. Also ive heard complaints about the map Looking the same everywhere you go. But keep in in mind that's just because that's the theme of the island it's all simular but still different. In my opinion geographly speaking. Now this game really isn't at all like Far cry 3 mainly because it's a Completely differnt game in it's self lol. So don't Expect VAs to be in it. Now if you liked the 80s decade or any of the far cry games then this is a must own.

Blood Dragon has cool visuals, a very campy 80's feel, some decent bits of humor, and a kick-awesome soundtrack.\n\nYet where Blood Dragon suffers is when it tries to be over-the-top ridiculous and use the Far Cry 3 game mechanics at the same time. You're given a rifle that can shoot lasers, turrets, a minigun, a laser you mount on your wrist, and you're supposed to feel like the ultimate badass that can kill everything.\n\nYet the Far Cry mechanics call for stealth, not run-and-gun. So for example if you do a hostage mission, you have all these cool guns that you just want to go pew pew and boom boom with, but if you get spotted by the guards then you have seconds until the hostage is killed. What? These mechanics that fail to properly invent exciting combat are fully realized with the Blood Dragons. There is no really strategy to kill them, other to mercilessly run and shoot. Left 4 Dead makes this fun because the gunplay makes sense. Here it simply does not.\n\nOh, and by the way, you use the same button to heal yourself and to extinguish fire on you. Due to the first person perspective, it's difficult to tell when you are on fire and when there's just fire around you. So you press Q before you are given the prompt to do so thinking you can put out the fire early. Instead, you just waste a syringe/time healing yourself and then you're still on fire.\n\nOverall, if you enjoyed Far Cry 3 and just want to have a more absurd version of that, this will suit you well. If you want to be the ultimate badass, play Serious Sam or Saints Row or anything else that is actually BUILT for that.\n\n","December 28, 2013","false","6.2"," 55 of 83 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","55","83","0","4"

Far Cry 3's stand alone add on Blood Dragon capitalizes on this as an entirely ridiculous, self aware gaming experience that bathes in a pool of 80's action cinema staples. It's not exactly a new idea but since we are laughing at Duke Nukem instead of with him these days, it's safe to say there is room on the market for a game like this. Montages, a synth soundtrack, one liners, vicious weapons and colossal lizards that shoot lasers out of their eyes are central elements of this love letter to all things awesomely bad about 80's action flicks.\n\nBlood Dragon takes the core elements of Far Cry 3 and grafts them into Blood Dragon's scan line littered world. It's landscape is dotted with outposts that look like GI Joe playsets which can be captured from enemy hands. These outposts have varying layouts and terrain that encourage you take take a new approach to each one. In these sequences the Blood Dragon's play their biggest role. These creatures have atrocious eye sight allowing you to sneak past them and can be lured with cyber hearts. Using the tools at your disposal, you can get the dragons to do your dirty work for you; though, if things go wrong they can become a much more formidable obstacle than the cyborgs that you are trying to clear out in the first place. Taking these outposts allows Rex to fast travel to that point and opens predator and hostage rescue missions. Predator missions task your cyborg hero with killing a unique creature or unit with a specific weapon while hostage rescues give you the job a saving a scientist from enemy hands. The wrinkle to these missions is that alerting the enemy to your presence will cause the guards to shot the hostage so some stealth is required to complete these tasks. Completing these mildly repetitive missions as well as collecting the various files, VHS tapes and televisions strewn around the island unlock weapon attachments. Being able to main enemies with a quad barrel shotgun with flaming rounds or a sniper rifle that uses exploding ammunition ensures that these side tasks are worth seeing through. The seven main missions can be completed in just a couple of hours so doing the side missions is highly encouraged.\n\nBlood Dragon suffers from an imperfect upgrade progression. Killing enemies grants you cyber points which acts as experience. With every level he gains, Rex becomes stronger, receiving more health and special abilities. I wholly expected Rex to become a nigh invincible hard ♥♥♥ but the point at which he becomes a demi-god comes much too quickly. With a few levels and weapon upgrades Blood Dragon not only becomes unchallenging but most of the finer points of completing the side missions are decimated with a sledgehammer. It becomes unnecessary to rescue hostages stealthily when you can mow through a half dozen guards faster than they can kill a single scientist. Capturing outposts also suffers once it becomes feasible to stand toe to toe with twenty enemies using your mini gun.\n\nWith it's skies polluted by unicorn flatulence and flourishes of neon glow, Blood Dragon's aesthetic could be best described as a gay pride parade held in Gary, Indiana. The skies are hazy and red, the waters murky and black and colorful ruins dot the island. The terrain isn't as intricate as Far Cry 3 but there are enough landmarks and areas of interest to make it interesting to explore. Creatures with unusual color pallets and glowing eyes roam the island ready to pick Rex apart if provoked. Blood Dragon emphasizes artistic style rather than the technical prowess of the engine. The soundtrack, courtesy of Power Glove, is absolutely incredible and may be the single element that most sells Blood Dragon as a throwback to 80's action films.","November 25, 2013","true","12.7"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","27","35","0","0"

Good Lord, Ubi has a felt million employees.\n\nAnyway, to the game. Glorious, ridiculous, to the point. Shocked such a dumb premise got greenlit by a big pub. Glad it did. The game is fun, very much so but I advise against clearing the strongholds. I did a couple after every main mission and it totally broke the pacing. It's boring, repetitive and not worth it. You get one to two side missions in every liberated garrison but they are copy-paste small mindless chores after the first few times. They unlock one weapon modification in the in-game store but honestly, they are not worth it. Most are just needless while others are way overpowered and take any challenge out of the already easy game. But most of all, they brake the otherwise perfect pacing of the game. Forget about garrisons and any other side occupation, just focus on the main missions which are great fun. Cutscenes and story were absurd, stupid fun and the soundtrack is just a gem.

It's sarcastic, over-the-top and very unrealistic but very fun and entertaining while staying affordable. I probably had more fun with this one than any of the other Far Cry games.\n\nThe game is unique, the plot progresses by 8-bit style stills but voice acting is also present. Everything from the graphical interlace lines to the pixel art style cut-scenes and even the names of the characters, make this game feel like you are in a living breathing action film from the 80's. The storyline is short but there's alot of extras to make you want to go back and play the game for a second time.\n\nAs a bonus for those of us that are 80's babies, you will notice the references that were put in this game just to butter your feathers. Throwback one-liners to bring you back to the most popular 80's shows and movies. Bionic Man, Predator, Terminator, Escape From New York and a few others.\n\nPros  The open world feels much different than your traditional Far Cry game\nInteresting characters\nEngaging and intense conspiracy story\nTons of futuristic gear and weapons\nGood bang for your buck\nFull Controller Support\nCons  Very short campaign\nA.I can be a little weak\nDeserves a better UI\nThe interlace effect can distract sometimes\nFinal Thoughts:\nIt's worth the money, in fact I'd recommend this one over Far Cry 3. 80's type Cyborgs are cool again thanks to this game.

If you are familiar with how things work in Far Cry 3, this game should be no problem for you. The twist here is that there are now huge "blood dragons" on the planet. Remember in Far Cry 3, when you could use an animal to storm an enemy base. In BD, simply toss a cyberheart (The hearts of the enemies you killed) near a group of enemies and watch as they get wrecked.\n\nStory:\nThe year is 2007 and the game takes place in a dystopian world. You, Sergeant "Rex", must investigate Colonel Sloan and see what he is up to. In short, kill bad guys, save people, be the hero.\n\nGuns, guns, and...awesome guns that...kill stuff:\nGunplay is similar to Far Cry 3. You capture outposts (Garrisons) and you can hunt wild animals to unlock more goods. Good news is that you already have 4 weapon slots at the start and all the guns are already unlocked (well at least most of them). You startout with a pistol, a rifle, a sniper rifle, and an old styled shotgun (One word: reloadgasm).

Sure, the 80's aesthetic is nice, the story a nice 80's flick parody, and the music by Power Glove is bangin', but Michael Biehn is what makes this game awesome.\n\nNow, sure, Far Cry 3 sucks, and UPlay is the equivalent of a dump truck's fart, but the gameplay is generally fun and being set in this over-the-top 80's vision of a retro futuristic 'post-apocalyptic', laser beam firing, neon world makes this a great little package.\nIt is an open world ubisoft game so you do have to get over the fact that there's a lot of pointless ♥♥♥♥ littered throughout the world (Which our protagonist, Rex, ocassionally uses as the source of jokes ("I hope I don't have to collect any ♥♥♥♥ing feathers" (AC joke), and stuff like "Whoever thought this was fun, I'm gonna find their head and put it on my wall")) but the main missions are always fun to play.\nThe story itself is enjoyable, following the one of the last Mark IV cyber commando Rex Colt (played by the amazing Michael Biehn) as he tries to stop his evil, old commander from launching nukes in the post-apocalyptic, neon filled, retro-futuristic future of 2007. The story is fun and doesn't take itself too seriously. It plays its cutscenes in SNES like graphics, and the game is full of 80s film references (obviously to films like Terminator and Aliens, in both of which Michael Biehn had potrayed major characters).\n\nOverall, this is a good game.

Very funny 90s B-movie-esque humor, great setting, funny retro-cutscenes, overall very solid gunplay (except arena), very good music, cheesy and funny voice-acting, enough stuff to do and things to explore.

While the ride is short, around 6 hours if you clear most of the outposts and side missions to level your character up, since it is a Farcry 3 game it’s very open and has a level of replayability.  The story is good enough with the cutscense using old school 16 bit still images which again add to the old school feeling of the game.  However what it doesn’t do is take itself serious, this is a comedy game make no mistakes and the comedy that is there is fairly solid though younger players who did not live though the 80s and 90s might not get many of the references or be able to fully appreciate what the game is showing you.\n\nThe game’s style is great though the scan lines might give people the wrong impression about the visuals of the game though they do seem to muddy up the image a bit.  However with everything being neon in tone it’s not hard to find objects, enemies and animals within the game.  Blood dragons are by far one of the coolest natural animals that you will see in many games and they fit very well within the universe, they are also a force to be reckoned with, before you gain the highest level that is.\n\nThe one major advantage of this game is that once you to get to the highest level and max out most/all of the sub missions you will feel like a bad ♥♥♥, unlike in Farcry 3 which was at times rather bland once you gained your full powers.  The arsenals are awesome though some are more useful then others, some are more customizable then FC3 while others are less so however the important ones you do have the ability to make almost every weapon 10 times better.\n\nIf any of this sounds good to you then by all means buy it and enjoy, whether it be for the humor or the fun gameplay you will enjoy your time spent playing FC3: Blood Dragon.","April 23","true","9.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

For those who watched such movies like First Blood, Commando, Robocop (the original), this is one's dream come true. If you haven't, you will still get a kick out of Rex POWER Colt's no-frills personality and nigh-endless one-liners that flow out of him with every action and major scene.\n\nComing from someone who has not played the original Far Cry 3 game, Blood Dragon certainly feels very fresh in my hands and runs smoothly on a middling PC. Neon-colors dot almost every inch of the violent island, definitely giving it that neo cyberpunk feeling. Almost all of the creatures that inhabit said island are given some kind of shiny robot-like texture, signifying just how MUCH of everything was hit with cybernetics. Oh, and already starting out with a plethoral of abilities will make it hard for me to try out the original Far Cry 3 with far weaker (and less cool) puny human.\n\nCampaign is somewhat short-ish, but for a cheap stand-alone title with loads of humor (and the fact that said Campaign can be extnded via going on a Garrison takeover spree), no doubt this game has (already) found plenty of fans clamouring for more.","October 11, 2014","true","17.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Review to a Kill...\n\nThat will be the one and only cheesy pun in this review of Ubisoft's Standalone Expansion 'Far Cry 3- Blood Dragon', as anymore will leave you feeling a little bloated when you get into the madness that is this game. You see, Blood Dragon is a spoof-game on so many levels: It spoofs the 80s VHS Action Movie Genre and perhaps most impressive it spoof's Ubisoft's gameplay style to perfection!\n\nI have a question to ask: Have you seen and enjoyed the following movies?\n\nAliens\nRambo\nTerminator\nTransformers?\n\nDo you enjoy movies starring the follow actors?\n\nJean Claude Van Damme\nMichael Biehn\nArnie\n\nDo you tell all your friends that all the best music was made in the 80s? Do you still dream of a world where synths and neon lights in a not-so-distant dystopia society rule over the masses? Well I might just have the game for you..!\n\nIt's a FPS based around the Far Cry 3 engine, so if you've played Far Cry 3 than you should know what to expect. If you haven't then be prepared to be dropped on an 'open world' Island that you're free to explore at your will. There are various collectibles, unlockables, etc (such are Ubisoft Games), as well as your standard enemie types.\nIt's a fun game that really embraces the subject material it's lampooning from the very first moment the game boots up.\n\nThe actual gameplay itself is tired and nothing new, yet it's the character and the world around you that keeps you playing. The one liners drew me back to a day when Duke Nukem was considered a master piece, and thankfully this game has as many one liners as it does bullets and mindless violence!\nIn fact, it's perhaps all the supporting material that keeps Blood Dragon feeling like a breath of fresh air in a very worn out genre void of much originality. The strange neon visuals look stunning at times as you storm into Garrisons to kill the Biker Helmet wearing nameless bad guys to a very satisfying Synth based soundtrack. The little details make the big experience worthwhile, so if you're not too fond of those details you'll perhaps not enjoy the game as much as I did. If, however, you find yourself going back to the stack of movies you have starring Action Heros from the 80s than this game might just help reignite your interest in FPS.\n\n+ 80's Action Hero Genre\n+ One Liners\n+ Spoofs\n+ Doesn't Out Stay It's Welcome\n\n- I have no idea if they'll make a follow up to this genre!\n- Worn out gameplay\n\nOverall a satisfying short experience for 80s Action/Sci-Fi Movie Buffs, but it might not be for everyone's tastes.","March 24, 2014","true","3.9"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Ladies and gentlecarrots: Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon.\n\nThe Pros:\n· Kewl looking weapons that'll allow you to make heads go splat and limbs go splooch!\n· The amount of one-liners is so high it's only legal in Amsterdam.\n· A big open map with quite a lot of content for only 15 boring real-life dollars.\n· If you melee thin air you'll actually flip the bird. You won't flip an actual bird over on its back but you'll raise your middle finger in a manner that says "F**k you too"!\n· Very  pretty-lookin' neon-rich visuals. I felt like I had entered an old 80s diner and just stared at the jukebox while being high on acid. (Jukebox or acid not required to play, but it might increase the experience. Seriously, what was the last time that a jukebox and/or acid didn't make something better? Except for rehab.)\n\nThe Cons:\n· Despite its gameplay mechanics (that actually work this time around, not like the original Far Cry 3) it has nothing in common with Far Cry what so ever. Apart from the devs, of course. Otherwise it'd be sued for copyright about now, and the only way to get it was either pirating the game or starting to dig holes in the Mexican desert. (Again, no eyepatch or shovel required.)\n· I need more of this. A full Blood Dragon game, with a bigger world and longer story and larger dragons and more guns and maybe even a bit more neon. Maybe. WHO AM I KIDDING OF COURSE WE NEED MORE NEON.\n\nThe Visuals:\n· I like neon. I like sci-fi. I like pretty things. Do you like neon, sci-fi and/or pretty things? But of course you do. Oh yes you do.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n· Things go pew pew pew and then you're like 'Oh noes I gots to heal!' and then you jam a cyberfluid-filled needle in your arm and you're all better and you're like 'Hell yes!' and things keep going pew pew pew until they stop and you're like 'Yeah time to go to the next thing and do more pew pew pew' and unkindly raise your middle finger at everything you may or may not encounter on your path to pew pew pew goodness.\n\n11/10 because of reasons and neon.","September 21, 2014","true","3.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/comradesniper/recommended/233270/","comradesniper","gr8stalin's mustache!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/comradesniper/","528 products in account","I love FC3 Blood Dragon because it hits a lot of gameplay high notes perfectly and doesn’t drag out, but I recommend grabbing it on sale since it’s not a game that has a whole lot of replay value and it still suffers from some of the problems Far Cry 3 did.\nThe story is a whole heap of 80s tropes, icons, and catchphrases slapped together with a hint of modern spice that does something that I personally think is special: while the setting, dialogue, and weapons are wild, none of these things become overly ridiculous as the game progresses; no wildly out of place bonerfarts or buttstallions prodding you with a red-hot poker for a reaction here. What happens instead is that the story and setting are introduced immediately as parody, allowing the player to immediately suspend their disbelief and simply enjoy the ride.\n\nRex is a great extension of the player: he has small reactions to the world around him (including missions), the character is actually enjoying himself, and there’s no emotional turmoil for Rex outside of a very 80s twist at the end. This is in stark contrast to young Whiny Zoolander from Far Cry 3, who couldn’t decide if he was a hardened killer or a scared kid who just wanted to take his friends and family home and could somehow proficiently wield firearms with zero prior training (I’m not purposefully omitting the main character’s name, I actually do not remember him as anything else but Whiny Zoolander). Rex’s character is actually surprisingly important in this regard because if the main character is lively and likes what he’s doing, the player will be on the receiving end of those feelings as well.\n\nIn FC3, Whiny Zoolander is a know-nothing college student who has to slowly become lord of the game, but there isn’t any extreme challenge early on because FC3 forcibly railroads the player into what they should and shouldn’t go after early on with mandatory early missions, so this limitation does nothing to actually make the player truly feel as if they’re overcoming a challenge. Quite conversely, in combination with the elasticated XP gain, it simply makes the player wonder when they’ll finally be able to get into the thick of it as they click on lone guards and wild animals for the nth time and by the time they reach the second island, the game is already almost over. It also doesn’t help that in FC3, any weapon that actually looks fun is stashed behind a tech tree, quest, and/or XP wall.\n\nThe most important thing about Blood Dragon’s combat to me is that although there are fewer weapons to choose from altogether, none of the weapons suck. Instead, they start off good and just get better the more one plays and the more the player unlocks things. Weapons are accurate, reasonably powerful in regards to what each weapon does, and have plenty of ammunition. Players can carry 4 weapons right off the bat. Weapon upgrades merely enhance the versatility and further increase the power of the weapons they upgrade instead of being absolutely necessary to obtain reasonable firepower and accuracy. There is no weapon deprecation; instead, weapons fill different purposes and niches.\n\nAnother one of my absolute favorite parts of the game is the fact that there’s no overarching “best strat” of just assassinating everything in your path or taking high ground in one spot and picking the bots off as they predictably run to trigger the base alarm. You can choose to be a sneaky bugger and chain assassination kills if you want, or you can go right in guns blazing and break some backs. The bases were constructed in such a way that there’s more thought and freedom to what the player can actually do. There’s a lot more detail to each base in Blood Dragon than in FC3.\n\nAnother thing I’d like to bring up is that while Far Cry 3 will have people clocking in low double-digit hours if they want to hunt down everything in the game, Blood Dragon is an easy 7 or 8 hours of constant fun depending on how one plays it. The quests are much more active, but there are fewer of them. The immediate response to this is “Well that sucks! I want a game with content!” My response to that would be, “Would you like to jackass around the map just to stealth kill the same officer 60 times or would you rather a rescue mission take place in reasonably close proximity to a base you want to capture right after?” Essentially, it’s quality and uniqueness over quantity and repetitiveness.\n\nDespite my lavish praise, Blood Dragon isn’t the perfect game I’ve made it out to be in the last few paragraphs. It has its fair share of shortcomings. For one, the world is pretty static. The AI doesn’t really do anything to step up unit spawns and patrols (more and bigger squads of enemies) once the player starts their conquest, it’s more of a world that’s simply yours to take from without consequence. The enemy types are pretty limited – human enemy types (the most common) are limited to 5. You fight lots of grunts and Molotov tossers with a scattering of heavy troopers and the odd sniper here and there, and that’s it. I had the following gripe for when I played Wolfenstein The New Order: with the setting provided and how wild and imaginative the game was, there wasn’t enough experimentation with unit types in relation to the trope. Cyberninjas that could digitize themselves to hide in computers? Enslaved Vietnam War II veterans encased in robotic suits? Luddite forces that fight against all the factions with old or even primitive weaponry?\n\nThe fact that the super weapon was highly encouraged until reaching “the” mount during the ending sequence was also not terribly fun, since it was a thoughtless “point and win” weapon. I would have loved if it was a plot device instead, with Rex going in guns blazing with a horde of angry nerd scientists jacking helicopters and vehicles and fighting to support Rex. There were so many explosive barrels and variances in height that it would have made sense for that entire first half of the ending sequence to be a clash between the two factions.\n\nOverall, I really liked Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon, much more than the base game. I recommend it to anyone looking for a fun time, but if you’re someone who doesn’t like dropping $15 on 7 hours of content, grab it on sale.","March 22","true","7.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","4"

The theme of the game is based off of the 1980s dystopian sci-fi films and includes voiceover from Michael Biehn (Terminator, Aliens, etc.) with a soundtrack fit for retro-techno-badassery. The developers clearly had fun with the environment, sounds and effects which creates a very enjoyable game that pays homage to a particular classic sci-fi genre.

The world has been overrun by killer cyborgs, and only one cyber commando can stop them. This is Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon, an amazing FPS that takes its weaponry and style from the films of the 80s and its missions and attitude from the FPSs of the 90s. It packs more memorable moments into its $15 price point than most FPSs nowadays can fit in at $60. The weapons, from Arnie's shotgun from T2, to Robocop's handgun, have a distinct kick that makes the combat addictingly fun. You could spend hours planning out stealth runs to take out dudes with shuriken and a neon katana, or you can charge in with your minigun and a sniper rifle that shoots explosive rounds. And I haven't even mentioned the dragons that shoot lasers out of their eyes.\n\nWhen you were a kid, this is the type of video game you dreamed about playing, and it was worth the wait. There wasn't another game this entire year that ripped my attention away from Blood Dragon, and after three playthroughs it still feels amazing. You're doing yourself a disservice by not playing it right now, even if you've already completed it.\n\nMy GOTY 2013.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dekonega/recommended/233270/","Dekonega","Dekonega","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dekonega/","508 products in account","I ended up recommending this game but it was probably one of the hardest decisions I've made recently here in Steam. This is a game that is not fun to play outside of few interesting moments and kind of funny scenes. But please don't misunderstand me. I absolutely love the theme and the idea behind the Blood Dragon.\n\nThis is a very stylish game with some really funny stuff in it. Especially for those of you who understand the references to the 80's action films and animated cartoon series. You can get a lot of out of this by just wanting to know what's the next thing the developers put into the game. But I guarantee that it's going to require hard work. It's also the only real motivation to make progress in this game.\n\nYou see, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is not fun to play. The gameplay revolves around mostly just running from point A to point B. And it's boring as hell. You run around, do simple kills, and then run around again. Killing the stuff is so easy that even on the hardest difficulty level I never really died unless I became so bored that I lost focus and then died because I didn't bother to even try.\n\nThe main objective in Blood Dragon is to collect stuff, so you can buy more stuff, that allows you to kill more things more efficiently. To be able to get more stuff you need to perform series of tasks, but you just cannot do them without liberating a garrison and unlocking those tasks, these tasks involve usually killing certain things in a certain way, and oh boy, it's annoying as hell. When you're travelling you need to collect random stuff along the way.\n\nThis is a game where the main story can be completed within a four hours or less. Collecting the stuff takes probably another four to five hours. After the main story is complete the end game is easy and boring marathon. Especially if you're planning on getting all the achievements like I did.\n\nThere are few rare moments when you're playing in a closed hallways and arenas which are used to advance the story. The story is mostly just as meaningless and cliché as most 80's action film plots are but in a wrong way. Result is a boring and meaningless mess of things. The script writers had the right idea but they were the wrong people to do it.\n\nI found it funny that although you cannot reach the kind of speed you can reach in Daikatana or Doom, players can still run faster than the vehicles in this game. Blood Dragon in overall has probably fastest gameplay I've seen in a recently released game. However the gun mechanics don't work like they'd work in an old school shooter. That ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off the most as the game is mostly optimised for gamepads.\n\nI could write more about the gameplay but I doubt anyone would read all that. Let me just sum it all up. This game is boring. Just as boring as the Far Cry 2 and Far Cry 3 are.\n\nMost things in Dragon Blood are suitably 80s. I don't need to pick them up and pull apart one by one.\n\nVisually the game functions mostly OK. Sometimes there are really weird slowdowns but usually just restarting the game it starts to work again. The neon lights and the colour palette in the Blood Dragon can cause huge eye strain and I'd recommend taking 15 minute breaks after every one hour spent playing the game. My eyes were bleeding dragon blood after playing this for a while. Blood Dragon also crashes every now and then without any apparent reason but at least it makes automatic saves after any and every meaningful event so you don't lose progress.\n\nThe only thing I can honestly say was really awesome in Blood Dragon was its sound design and especially its soundtrack. It's full of really good FX and music with hints to various films and TV series but it still manages to sound fairly original and suitably 80's. It's just the perfect thing in this game. And I dare to suggest that you rather go to Amazon.com and order the soundtrack instead of buying this game. The voice acting is suitably bad in a good way that fits the game's mood.\n\nThe controls work fairly well in the game but it's just weird how many actions there are which require you to hold a key pressed. Why not just pressing once to do the action? It would have made this game a lot more pleasant to play if instead of stopping, holding E, and then moving again players were able to just tap once when they're nearby something they can loot. I do however understand the need to keep Q pressed down to heal. The healing mechanic worked fairly well but I would have expected to have a separate key for the health packs that instantly give maximum health. I also just loved the fact that there's a dedicated "F*ck you" button in the game bidden to F.\n\nBlood Dragon uses Ubisoft's Uplay which means that you don't get to play the game before you've installed and upgraded that thing and oh boy, it can take time. I probably spent 5 to 6 hours in just trying to get the Uplay to work. It constantly kept disconnecting while it was downloading updates. It was awful. And when I finally had it updated and installed... I swear that every single time I started the game Uplay was updating something. It completely stripped me of any will I still had in me to buy other games made by Ubisoft that use Uplay. As a funny side note the Uplay apparently disables screen capture and pressing PrtSrc does nothing.\n\nThat pretty much sums up the game. It's a game about funny 80's stuff without being actually a fun enjoyable game. There are much better games out there but at least to my knowledge this is the only one where you can play as a kind of funny walking parody of a Terminator T-800 that uses Robocop's pistol, has the Rambo's attitude, Cobra's moves, and overall is a generic 80's cartoon action hero with Viatnam War II stories to give the character little backstory, and you fight (and later in the game ride) a f*cking dinosaurs that shoots lasers from its eyes just like in the Dino-Riders.\n\nAnd yes, it even has a sex scene like the one you can see in 80s and perhaps in some early 90s films. The 80's theme goes up to the point that it even is little bit racist in a funny and politically incorrect way which earns it a lot of points. Oh yeah, this game also has Michael Biehn as the voice of the main character. I'll give more points to for that cleverness. I'd say it's worth checking it out if you can get it cheap.","November 24, 2014","true","15.2"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, on the other hand, successfully manages to be both hilarious and refreshing to play. Far Cry 3's gameplay was already fun, but when an 80's movie theme and dragons with laser-shooting-eyeballs are added to the mix, the game turns into something truly incredible. The dialogue is loveably cheesy (and often lewd), the guns are insane, the main missions and garrison-radings are well-designed for different styles of play, and the graphics are both stylish and gorgeous to look at.

It's got lots of neon, dragons, a cheesy story, old school music and a lot, A LOT, of explosions. All combined into a neat little Far Cry package. Meaning it's an open world environment, and it has sidemissions and upgrades, too.\n\nIf you're from the 80's theres's a high probability you'll instantly fall in love with this game. I did. It looks great in motion, the voice acting is great (although the story is purposely ridiculous) and it has tons of action in it, thanks to some awesome weapons in it. The world feels a bit empty, however. Where Far Cry 3 was filled with wildlife, I rarely saw wild animals in Blood Dragon. But it's possible that was because of the lighing and the fact that I didn't really explore like I normally do. Nothing big, it just caught my attention.\n\nBlood Dragon is, unfortunately, also a bit on the short side. Completing the game, doing only the main missions, took me about 3,5-4 hours to do. Enough for a downloadable game and more importantly, to keep things interesting. If you add the hunting missions and other sidemissions you can probably double that number. Upgrading your character also happens automatically (there are no skill trees) so replaying the game isn't all that interesting because you'll gain the same skills and perks every time, no matter what.\n\nNot that it mattered, because I had a blast playing Blood Dragon, and that's all that counts.

Blood Dragon is completely different in the sense that the survival element has been completely removed from this standalone expansion.\n\nFar Cry 3: Blood Dragon is basically a gigantic spoof of 80's movies and filled with 80's references in a comedic sense and cyber-punk manner. I didn't grow up in the 80's so I don't really get the jokes, but to anyone who has. This is the game for you! Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is in my top 3 best games list of 2013, it's cool, it's funny and down-right stupid. Unlike Far Cry 3, which was based on the harshness of the jungle, the enviroment and the enemies, this game is NOT a frightful survival game, which I meantioned at the start.\n\nTHE STORY: You play as Rex "Power" Colt, a cyborg military man who is rebuilt to be better, stronger and faster. You start out in a machine gun turret inside a helicopter (Yeah, best beginning ever) and descend to take a tutorial (which shows a comedic part of the game) When Rex Colt takes the tutorial, he is frustrated and angry and wants to shoot things, while the tutorial lady is speaking. (Quite a funny scene) It is chock-full of bright lights, with a cyberpunk feel to it making it graphically impressive.\n\nTHE PORT: Excellent port, has and FOV slider, full world detail changes and nice options to do with textures. Why did I list the FOV slider as a key feature? Becuase this one can go anywhere from 55-110, varies quite well when you really have a look at it.\n\nRELEVANCE: This standalone expansion is quite similar to the base game, only cybered-up and takes off more 80's movies.\n\nPROS\n\n+Nice options menu and graphics customisation\n+Funny plot and comedic "hints"\n+Isn't another ♥♥♥♥ing MMS (Modern Military Shooter)\n+Nice change from a jungle-theme to a cyber-punk theme\n+You run faster than you drive\n\nCONS\n\n-Short story\n-Low replayability\n-Everything is red\n-Smaller map\n-Useless side quests\n-Small amount of weapons (Some credit to the creators anyway, most of the weapons are spoofed)\n-Requires a Uplay account.\n\n9/10, would definitely recommend picking it up on a sale.","March 7, 2014","true","17.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

For those that can handle ,and accept, and embrace the extreme ( and I mean extreme) cheesiness that is this standalone expansion, then by all means  I do recommend this expansion.

The gameplay is good, I have no complaints there, the graphics are okay, its not bad but its not made by angels either, its good enough. The soundtrack is, as someone would hope, entirely made of 80's tunes, especially the movies and tv series of that decade. Yes it is a short game, but you know what? For the price that it is, its good deal. A really good deal, one of the few games that I didn't regret buying, not even a little. It leaves the taste for more, actually, I personally wanted more, but guess I'll have to wait for the sequel( A rumor to me so far). The badside... Uplay. Yeah. Ubisoft screwing us up.

For the very cheap cost of fifteen dollars you will get around 10 hours of gameplay but it is so well made and so cramped with one liners, hilarious storytelling, collectables, great characters, and awesome one of a kind moments that you will want to play it over and over.\nI beat this game a little over its half point on my first playthrough and I ran into some issues with Ubisoft's Uplay giving my Uplay account an awful generated name (it was something like "User123ABC"...etc). And so after I got my account renamed and wiped, my progress was gone. If this happened on any other game I would have quit right there. But I had no hesitation to restart the hilarious and fun adventure in Blood Dragon's post apocalyptic, neon light lit world. And incase you are wondering... yes the Blood Dragons are badass and encapsulates every little boys dream of seeing a neon lit, laser spitting, cyber dinosaur.

The ridiculous 1980's neon future art and theming is definitely a part of that, but there's more to it then just that.  Blood Dragon takes the good parts of Far Cry 3 and leaves out a lot of the bloat, including the slow, laborious upgrade system.\nBlood Dragon does take away some of the "open world" feel to the game (which is intact, but much less pronounced or "free" as in FC3), but I believe it to be a worth sacrifice for a tighter experience.  Where I feel that FC3 was probably 75% filler and only 25% "killer", Blood Dragon is probably the opposite, if not 100% killer.\nThat is, of course, as long as you like the sometimes-sneaky sometimes-loud first-person shooting that Far Cry 3, BD, and now FC4 all offer.\n\nThere is a caveat to all of this, however, and one that is a deal-breaker for some.  That caveat is Uplay.  Ubisoft's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t DRM/PC gaming platform that doesn't work half the time and is often a pain in the ♥♥♥.  Honestly it didn't really interrupt my experience with Blood Dragon at all, despite being a minor annoyance to starting the game up.  If you've had bad experiences with, or refuse to use, Uplay, then obviously you're just going to have to miss out on Blood Dragon.\n\nIf you're like me and can look past Uplay, Blood Dragon offers a great FPS experience.  Don't expect a breathtaking story, but the gameplay has honestly kept me entertaining through two complete playthroughs, including restarting and completing all the fortresses at least once.","October 17, 2015","true","20.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There are missions and open-world gameplay, and you can't do a hard save in the middle of a mission.  There are checkpoints within the missions, but if you quit the game and come back, you have to restart that mission.  It's fine in the open-world sections.  Also had trouble sometimes with not being able to walk up 2-inch steps, which is annoying while stealthing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/recommended/233270/","kryskiller666","BadassFreeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/","217 products in account","I decided to replay this game and make a review out of it. You know, for science and stuff. As usual, I will talk about the bad stuff first:\n\nFirst and foremost; Uplay. I shouldn't have to say anything else about that, but some people might not know much about it, so let's go into it. Uplay is a Steam-wannabe created by Ubisoft. It's laggy. It's crap. And if it wasn't bad enough, Ubisoft forces everyone to use it on their games. The thing is, you start the game and while other Steam games would likely start right away, with Ubisoft games you have to wait until this thing starts as well, and then the game starts. With singleplayer games ain't that bad, but if you have it on a new one, DEAR BUDDHA HAVE MERCY ON YOUR PATIENCE, as it will constantly ask for updates and crap like that. Uplay is even worse than Origin, and that's a big f#cking statement. And somehow, it still exists. Thankfully there are ways to disable it, and I seriously recommend you do it.\n\nThe other problem the game has is this lenght. For 15€ you would expect at least 6-8 hours of content, however on my new playthrough I barely got 4 out of it, clearing everything at 100%. The main story itself barely has arround 5 missions, the rest are side-quests to unlock upgrades to your weapons; stuff you will surely want to get your cyber-arms on. What's sad about this is that this game is quite original and fun, and I feel like Ubisoft got lazy when they could've turned this little standalone mod into a game of it's own. It also doesn't help that, while the island is decently sized, the character runs and swims so fast that even vehicles are pointless when traveling, and you even have Fast-travel.\n\nThat being said, is it good? Yeah. It's good. Have you seen any generic action movie from the 70's to the 90's? This game is pretty much a parody of all of them combined, throwing some game references along the way. The plot is so cheesy and idiotic that feels completely right.\n\nThe gameplay is, obviously, quite similar to Far Cry 3. The only important stuff that has changed are things like upgrading your weapons to insane levels, and the main character throwing one liners non-stop.\n\nThere's not much variety on enemies, and the NPC's indeed seem to be f#cking r#tarded, but they offer a decent challenge (until you upgrade your weapons, a fully upgraded shotgun pretty much kills anything on your screen in one or two shots).\n\nThe soundtrack is what stands out the most in the game, always delivering this special 80's style. The item descriptions and graphics also show what dumb humans from the past though earth would look in the future, which was actually quite hilarious.\n\nThere are also collectibles on the game, which you will need to get some of the collectibles, however you can buy maps that will show to you their exact location. With the speed you have, you can get them all in an hour.\n\nGranted, it's a fun experience. But a short one. And after clearing it 100%, I can't bring myself to recommend it at full price AT ALL. You should totally experience this, however wait for a sale. 7,50€ is good, but 5€ or bellow is perfect for this game. I just hope a sequel actually comes out someday, and it's longer and more 80's.\n\nTL;DR: The game's cool, but not worth the 15€ pricetag. Wait at least for a 50% sale.","February 26","true","9.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I loved it. This game plays just like the orginal Far Cry 3, but is a completely new game. You play as Rex Colt, a cyborg, as you embark on your quest to rid the world of Omega force. Just like Far Cry 3, there are story missions and side quests. As you clear out garrison filled with troops, you unlock new side missions, which reward you with new gear and attatchments. There isn't a whole lot of pressure put on you to upgrade your weapons, but it helps to do so. It just a way to waste time in the game.  The real reason to play this game lies within the story. Its full of humour and references, but manages to stay original. The world is brand new, with "future" lighting and a slew of new creatures (Inlcuding the "Blood Dragon", which is extremely difficult to kill). You get a few futuristic versions of guns from the previous game, and a couple completely new ones. As you happily battle your way through hoards of enemies, you level up your character and guns; making you stronger and stronger. You keep donig this until you reach the end, which feels like it came too soon.

Coated in neon colors and vaporwave like surroundings, Blood Dragon may be one of the most stylish video games I've played. The gameplay is the same as Far Cry 3, but with new neon soaked weapons. The bow and arrow even has neon colors.\n\nThe writing is very humorous, and often commentates on the 80's outlandish vision of 2007, and the pointless tropes seen in video games today. The story is the hypest it can get, you're a super solider that must kill bad guys and fight damn future dragons. What more do you want? You even have cutscenes that are like NES games and the likes.\n\nAll in all, Blood Dragon has been awesome so far, and who doesn't want to be a cyborg commando super-soldier?","April 20, 2015","true","5.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/233270/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","This is a long review so if you want just a brief summary of why I recommend Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon then skip to Results and read from there.\n\nUbisoft packs a punch with the epic 80s action movie video game. Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon pushes the bounds of traditional fps with epic dialogue, brilliant combat, hilarious cinematics, and an over the top story.\n\nStory:\nYou play as Rex, a Mark IV cyborg that is sent on a mission to clear out some hostiles. Upon arriving you discover the mission is a lot more complex than you originally assumed. Your partner Spider is killed right at the start and it’s up to you to get revenge and ultimately save the world. Dr. Darling is your female guide offering you more than just her brains. Sloan an evil super-villain has concocted a serum from the Blood Dragons that turns people into zombies. He’s going to unleash this concoction upon the world if you do not stop him.\n\nCampaign:\nFar Cry 3: Blood Dragon starts off with you flying into an blaze of glory only to end the same way. The campaign is ridiculously short, unless you go out an complete all other objectives. It took me 5 hours to complete the entire game (get every TV/Video, complete all missions, capture all the bases, kill all 12 animals, and upgrade every weapon). If you just ran the campaign I could imagine you completing it in under an hour and a half easy. There are about five actual missions, the one you play with Spider, the one where you blow up the dam, the one where you kill the scientist, the one where you complete the temples challenge, and the final one where you kill Sloan. The actual game takes place on an open-world map making you run between missions, but this is not a problem as you are a Mark IV and can sprint faster than the cars can drive, fall off cliffs without taking damage, and teleport to any of the captured garrisons.\n\nGameplay:\nThe combat makes you a complete and total hero, even on the hardest difficulty you will still be able to run into a room full of people and slaughter them like a wolf amongst lambs. You have a healthbar, but you are able to heal yourself without medpacks. For combat, missions, and secrets you get CP which levels Rex. Each level offers Rex a new ability (usually increased health and self-repair), but every now and then you get a special something else thrown in. If you complete missions and find secrets you can upgrade your guns in special ways making yourself even more heroic than before. There are eight weapons (A.J.M. 9, Fzertron, Kobracon, Galleria 1991, Bow, Terror 4000, Flamer, and KillStar) and two explosives (Grenades, and C400). The first four weapons have upgrades, the last four do not. You will find yourself using different weapons over others, but based on the nature of the game you will probably want to go for the loudest guns you can find.\n\nHints:\n>Some people are having problem with saving the game. If you are trying to play the game please note you will not be able to click the save button until you have fully completed the first and second mission. The game will save itself once you complete the first mission, and it will allow you to save once you complete the second mission.\n>Some of the animals you must kill will not be revealed till after you complete some of the garrison missions (if you do not complete the missions you will only find nine of them).\n>The Kobracon explosive round upgrade is probably the best weapon upgrade you will be able to get. It allows you to kill Blood Dragons like they are nothing, so I would recommend getting it.\n\nResults:\nFar Cry 3: Blood Dragon is an epic first person shooter that brings the 80s action hero genre to life. It feels like you are playing Arnold Schwarzenegger from Commando as you blast through hundreds of cyborg soldiers, wild animals, dragons, and zombies. The game is coupled with a hilarious soundtrack, amazing cut-scenes, epic dialogue, and downright awesome explosions. You will not find yourself bored while playing this game, so make sure you’re ready to become an epic action hero. Because Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is such a short game I would be wary paying full price if you are not 100% sure you want this title. This game is a great game if you can get it on sale.\n\nPros:\n+Character levels which make you considerably stronger.\n+Weapon customization which allows you to fully kit out guns making them even more destructive.\n+Fast travel which allows you to move quickly across the map.\n+Items you can buy from the store that reveal all the secrets on the map, saving you from having to actually look.\n+Epic combat system with awesome melee as well as ranged.\n+Lots of different enemies that keep you interested.\n+Dragons obviously…\n+Great graphics, scenery, and map design.\n+Open-world Environment (I personally do not like open-world FPS, but for those who do this is a pro).\n+Great dialogue, music, and cutscenes\n+You do not need Far Cry 3 in order to play this game.\n\nCons:\n-You have very little control over saving until after the first two missions, which is incredibly annoying.\n-Finding some of the animals is near impossible (also the stingray is classified as a civilian?)\n-You will spend more time traveling between objectives than you will actually playing the game.","April 27, 2014","true","6.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

All in all I know it's just FarCry 3 with an oldschool VHS overlay for the most part, but that is right up my alley as i'm an 80s freak. If you love cheesy / corny on seriously everything, bad to the bone gameplay, pure intense 80s arcade style graphics, serious awesomeness and if you love robots/cyborgs, laser firing dragons, neon blood, VHS glitches instead of a bloody screen when hit and a game filled to the max with testosterone... Play This Game. Even if you don't like anything like this, just try it. Honestly, the differences in this game that has been build of a known engine/physics will get you out of your bored week(end) and make you wanna take out your old VHS-player out of it's dusty filled box, grab the most badass movie you have nearby on VHS (or even take a trip as far as needed to a BlockBuster JUST to get that 1 VHS movie that's so irresistable) and sit there like you did as a little kid and enjoy, get hyper and completely stuffed on snacks or - since ur old enough now - order some take-away and just kick back and enjoy. Your next week will also be filled with nostalgia when u think back of that old console you used to play; weather it may be the sega, snes, playstation 1, xbox or even ur frkn gameboy color... Be sure to notify yourself of the harsh reality that you are an adult now and have to get up, get to work / college or do other chores that grown-ups have to do. Love to the 80s <3 here's some good music to get you more in the mood: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB9SsI6jZtI","February 28, 2015","true","1.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","2"

I remember hearing about this game awhile ago, and with the steam sale, how could i say no for 4 bucks?\n\nInstalled it, came back a few hours later play. Then it begins, It begins its prelaunch installations. But then i notice a Uplay icon appear on my desktop. "Oh no..." I thought to myself, not uplay, especially with their notorious history of horrendous anti piracy, and the latest incident with watch dogs.\n\nAfter it finishes it pops up a uplay screen, and invites me with a "Sign in to uplay" . I respond with a no, and try re-launching far cry to see if i can get around it. "No, No... I stay..." says uplay, and welcomes me once again with "Sign in". I sigh and begin trying to recall my password for uplay, with no luck i hit the password recovery.\n\nIt tells me to put in my email, and gives me a capatcha. I look at the capatcha instructions "Please type the two words:" and gives me two boxes. OK. I look up at the capatcha picture, and written is a mostly blank background, with "9215" written.\n\nJUST. 9215. WAT. I try 9215 in the first box. "Both fields are mandatory". I try refreshing thinking something is wrong. it gives me. "171". 1.7.1. After refreshing a few times and trying various combinations i finally got 222 to work by putting 22 in the first box and 2 in the second.\n\nAnd this is all so i can use the online features probably right, i could of skipped this and just played the single player right? WRONG. ITS A SINGLE PLAYER ONLY GAME THERE IS NO ONLINE WHAT EVEN.\n\n0. OUT. OF 10. DO NOT RECOMMEND. WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN. WOULD EVEN MAKE A NEW ACCOUNT AND RE BUY ALL MY OTHER GAMES SO I DONT HAVE TO LOOK AT IT IN MY STEAM LIBRARY.\n\nUpdate: I have attempted to run the game.

As you can imagine, America is non-too-chuffed that this is happening so they have got their two best part cyborg, part human soldiers on the case, Spider and the character the player plays; Rex Power Colt.\n\nLet me put this frank, Rex doesn't f**k around. He may as well have his balls out (and for all I know, he might) as he shoots bullets, lasers, arrows, explosives and god knows what else as he charges through the Omega cyborg army's bases. As he does this he taunts his enemies with such lines as "School's out... forever!" and "Way to fail on the job...d**ks**tter!".\n\nThe whole game screams of nostalgic 80's action goodness, reminiscent of such movies as Escape from L.A., Terminator and Robocop . It also have Sega Mega Drive-esc cut scenes, a sh*t load of references to other games and other 80's movies, plus enough up-gradable weapons and enemies to paint the ground blue with their synthetic brains. And I haven't even mentioned the freaking sharks and dragons(!?) that can shoot f**king lasers yet...\n\nWhile this is every 80's action loving kid's wet dream, I must stress the game is short. I'm certainly more than 50% of the way through it and I've been d**king around with side quests and base attacks. But for £2.99 and considering it is a standalone DLC, I am not complaining.\n\nThis is a game that I will return to constantly.

The game instead plays in the near opposite spectrum where the main missions throws the action straight in your face with little seriousness taken. For the most part the game is fun, loud, humourous and very much entertaining.  Outside of missions you're free to roam an shruken down vers of FC3's island with the same kind of side missions, collectibles and the basic structure that revolves around capturing outposts, a.k.a. garrisons. It's nothing much as special but then again, still provides the same pleasure as before. This also results in more content being offered, definitely making this DLC worth just about enough for its rather high price.","February 25, 2015","true","9.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I remember the weird, disjointed remains of the CCCP as a collapsing threat, and the last vestiges of the terror of nuclear war. I remember thinking that corporations were going to soon be able to own people, and I remember those last, fleeting touches of a dead future.\n\nFar Cry 3: Blood Dragon is more than just a parody. More than simply a mockery of an age, a tribute to ten mad years when we were trying to leave the past behind with lasers and robots. It is possibly the most cathartic experience I have ever had playing a video game. It's simple, yes. It's linear, yes. It has all the flaws and laudable elements of the initial release of Far Cry 3.\n\nWhen most games want to build up to a climactic fight, they present you with a challenge. I see now that this is the wrong attitude. There should be no challenge. No huge game-topping boss battle where you struggle hard to apply everything you've learned and done throughout the game.\n\nYou should be an invincible sociopath with unlimited ammo. You should mow down waves of those who stand before you, cackling madly at their ineffectuality. You should play the end of most games like you play all of this one.\n\nI was at the right age in the '80s to imagine myself as someone not unlike Sergeant Rex Power Colt.

It's fun and satisfying to treat the game like a big toybox playground of action figures from the 80s with you running around like a maniac at cyborg-enhanced speed blasting crowds of bad guys and finishing them off with shurikens and swords.\n\nThe humor, music, and visuals are also all great.  The neon-on-black aesthetic makes the whole game feel like you're running around inside a giant arcade from the 80s.\n\nThe only real downside is the major gameplay drag that was present in farycry 3 - the game, even on 'hard' mode, is still too easy.  The enemy AI is pretty dim and the enemies are far too easy to kill in general - even the blood dragons are chumps when you figure out their weakness.\n\nThere was also an opportunity with this game to make more threatening enemies - for example, stalker cyborgs that might be a combination of Terminator, bits of the predator, and the stalkers from the Running-Man movie.  Basically, things that could be a tough match for Rex Power Colt to deal with.\n\nThis game is also a budget spinoff made in-house, and it shows - they re-use assets for most of the game, and the game lacks a lot of features that would be great to have in a fully priced release - like epic boss battles and more variety.\n\nAs it is though, this is one of those 'must-play' games.  You will feel like your dreams from childhood of being a cybernetic soldier of the future who gets to cuss all he wants and be the coolest kid on the playground are being realized.\n\nOh and this game features one of the funniest sex scenes in anything.\n\nI look forward to seeing this game get its own true release in sequel/remake/spinoff form - everything from boss battles to coop play to more area, enemy, and mission variety needs to happen.  Rex Power Colt shall rise again.\n\n\nPS - When you play this game, unless you're rescuing a hostage or don't want to deal with a blood dragon at the moment, don't worry in the least about exercising caution.  Even on hard mode, you can pretty much run around like a maniac meleeing and stopping to blast a few enemies, so long as you run around behind cover a lot and use commo sense about not over-extending.  You're a superpowered cyborg after all, so you can do a lot more running and jumping than a human being  - might as well dash around like the Terminator stabbing people in the face.","November 29, 2013","true","27.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So if you want to explore every little cave and room you can  or just power through the main story. The only downside is the game ends quite quickly and unfortunately has little replay value but after a hard day's work there is nothing like mowning down multiple cyberborg soldiers with a mini-gun while spouting 80's styled puns and then giving them the cyber finger.\nAll we need now is a movie of this phenomenal game.

That being said however, the vast majority of the negative reviews are all concerning Uplay, Ubisoft's attempt on Steam, basically EA's Origin for Ubisoft. Personally however, I didn't find Uplay all that bad. Sure making an account or having Uplay launch whenever you want to play can be annoying, but in my honest opinion, Ubisoft has definitely improved Uplay since I first purchased this game two years ago. Uplay just launches and then sets you straight into the game with it's in game overlay available via Shift F2 (in addition to Steam's). Sure your achievements are saved to Uplay along with the cloud storage, but Uplay also comes with some "free" addons purchaseable with credits earned by completing in game tasks.\n\nOverall, I would say Uplay is a lot less intrusive than in the past, and would recommend this purchase (assuming you are into this type of game-see other reviews on actual gameplay) despite Uplay (which I personally  don't hate).","December 8, 2015","true","6.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After spending an hour-and-a-half trying to reset my password (last time I used it was for Assassin's Creed 2 on Xbox 360) and dealing with UPlay's fail-captchas, I finally decided to just make a new account. While I totally disagree against the requirement of the additional DRM/content client that is UPlay, I also have to take into account that I spent a lot of money (relatively speaking) to buy all the Farcry games. Once I had a new account, I was finally able to play the game.\n\nBeing someone that has seen a large number of 80's action movies, I caught on to many of the references and even recognized Michael Biehn immediately on the front cover. The game is fun and humorous from the Get-Go. The game play is boring however. I expected more explosions and campy dialog during fights, but even during the first scene of carnage, not a line of dialog was spoken--just some classic rock music and the white noise from a helicopter machine gun. At one point, I caught myself leaning on my hand and yawning while using my other hand to aim and shoot. The audio wasn't very loud like I wanted either, even with my volume turned all the way up--but I'm willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt and assume that's just my problem.\n\nIn the end, I can't recommend this game. It's fun for a short while but gets old really fast. If you didn't have to deal with UPlay just to play the game, maybe it would be worth it, but as it stands, it's just not.","June 22, 2014","false","1.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics are good, the sound fx are good, the music really accents the world.\n\nThe game is a bit short, but its a stand alone expansion pack, and I got it for just a few bucks during a sale. I sure got my money's worth, and then some. I have atleast 7-9 hours clocked in on the game. Exploring, (got all collectibles) and sneaking around stealth like.\n\nThe stealth mechanics seem semi-amatuer, but were still fun to sneak around with anyway.\n\nThe story is pretty campy, but that was obviously the direction the devs were going in for the game anyway.\nSome of the weapons were pretty awesome, love the pistol (although not nearly as useless on the hard game setting which is what I played on.) I liked the lazer chain guns, the bow, and the sniper rifle. I didn't really care for the shotgun (which I usually love) or the assualt rifle. I think they could have done better with those, but I did like the weapon upgrade system.\n\nI give the game about an 8.1 all in all!\n\nI highly recommend it for any fan of the 80's (sci-fi or otherwise), especially those who happen to be FPS fans.

Neon colours everywhere. "Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?"\n\nFeaturing an OST entirely composed by the australian music duo Power Glove, the sound is infused with electronic nostalgia that brings to mind many popular 80s film moments. It is one of the most memorable OST and I guarantee it will stay with you for days to come.\n\nThe gameplay is almost identical to that of Far Cry 3, but with a few tweaks and simplifications. Being a game influenced by films such as Robocop, Terminator, Rocky, Tron, Commando etc, the main hero is a cybernetic super-soldier that obliterates everything in his way with the use of his "little friend".

All in all it was a fun game start to finish from finding your first blood dragon to riding a dragon at the end of the game (then to learn it can die from one shot to the face but nevermind that) The whole game took max 8 hours to complete so if you want a long game go play far cry 3 but this is a different game in its own right. The end raised so many questions which i hope they answer in a easter egg in far cry 4 or make a Far cry BD 2.

Neon colours everywhere. "Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?"\n\nFeaturing an OST entirely composed by the australian music duo Power Glove, the sound is infused with electronic nostalgia that brings to mind many popular 80s film moments. It is one of the most memorable OST and I guarantee it will stay with you for days to come.\n\nThe gameplay is almost identical to that of Far Cry 3, but with a few tweaks and simplifications. Being a game influenced by films such as Robocop, Terminator, Rocky, Tron, Commando etc, the main hero is a cybernetic super-soldier that obliterates everything in his way with the use of his "little friend".

Lapio-Pimo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lapio-Pimo/","602 products in account","It's been 25 years since John Madden crashed through the front cover of your video game like a moppy-haired Kool Aid Man. That's 25 years of digital touchdown celebrations and the Cleveland Browns making it to the pretend Superbowl, just like in their dreams that never come true. For an anniversary so important it warrants messing up a long-established naming scheme, you’d think EA Sports would do more to celebrate it than just put in some retrospective trivia in the loading screens. Unfortunately Madden NFL 25 is more of a run-of-the mill upgrade than a big anniversary edition, but it is still a great version. Madden NFL 25 makes a lot of small improvements that build on last year’s big Madden NFL 13 revamp to create one of the finest football gaming experiences available.\n\nThe differences aren’t huge, and hard to spot at a glance, because most are under the hood. Over a few games, though, it becomes apparent that Madden 25 doesn’t screw up as much. The Infinity Engine 2 physics got a lot of tweaking, and players look more realistic than ever in action. Each tackle feels and looks different, with players tumbling to the ground in myriad ways, but this year they do it without the crazy splaying legs and linebackers comically tripping over a downed receiver after a play. The cartoonish goofiness that took us out of the experience is gone, and Madden feels one step closer to replicating the look and feel of a real NFL broadcast.\nThe other noticeable enhancement to moment-to-moment play is a much better set of tools for the running game. Maneuvers like spins, dives, stiff arms, and hurdles have all been improved and expanded, making great running backs and tight ends more awesome to play with. If you’re playing with a superstar athlete like Adrian Peterson, you can use a new Precision Modifier to really amp up the moves – if a player's stat in, say, Hurdles, is high enough, he can leap greater bounds, jumping over diving defenders. It's tough to pull off, and can only be done with the superstar athletes, but it's so satisfying when it happens.\n\nAll of the modes from last year's game return, with some new tweaks that add another fun layer on top. Like in Madden NFL 13, each of 31 online players can decide if they want to play as a coach or as a single player (created, real, or legendary) in Connected Franchise. But now Franchise lets you play in Owner Mode, putting you in control of an entire team's staff, finances, and stadium. For the most part this is just a lot of metagame menus on top of Coach Mode, and deciding the price of hot dogs and jerseys isn’t the kind of thing that’s going to be long-term fun for most. But there is some cool stuff in here, most notably the ability to move teams to new cities. I was pleasantly surprised that when I decided to move my St. Louis Rams I was encouraged to pick Los Angeles, and when I did the mode's faux-Twitter stream mentioned the return of LA's prodigal sons. Owner Mode is a novelty to some extent, but it's a well done novelty, and adds a new way to play the already expansive Connected Franchise.\n\nWith its incremental but noticeable improvements, Madden NFL 25 is the best football game experience I've had to date. It shines on a technical level, but the real issue with the series is that other sports games have improved so much faster that Madden 25 looks and feels dated by comparison – fake Twitter streams and pre-game montages are already old news. It would be better if EA Sports did more that was new and interesting rather than bringing back features discarded in previous versions. But the real meat-and-potatoes gameplay is better than ever, and when it comes down to it, we’re here to play some damn football. Madden 25 brings it with bone-crunching intensity.","July 1, 2014","true","11.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

FC3 just won't work. But let's redesign it: add Tronish neon retro-skin with powerful soundtrack, keep concept of fun game design in your heart (without ripping it out) and prime it with popular culture references and spot-on one-liners without teenish undertone. Especially soundtrack keeps this game afloat.\n\nI would have liked a bit harder gameplay difficulty, but it was entertaining enough. There was some grinding to get 100% collectable items and required dragon kills, but if you're not completionist then game flow is smooth. Hard difficulty 100% completion was under 17 hours and that includes time with game paused and watching credits.\n\nThis is one of those games you play only once through but that play-through is actually good one. There is no replayability value.\n\nYou can buy Blood Dragon without FC3, this a good purchase (15€) if you're looking for fast-paced retro-theme hero adventure to keep you entertained over weekend.","May 6, 2013","true","32.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lemming77/recommended/233270/","lemming77","Lem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lemming77/","619 products in account","Far Cry 3 is already a pretty solid shooter formula. An open world for a battlefield yields all sorts of strategic opportunities, letting you dictate every little detail of how you attack each situation, all while maintaining a very clear direction and objective, all tied together by their narrative. Add to that cyberpunk themes, a sense of humor, and the best action flicks the 1980s gave us, and you get Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon. An enormously fun, genuinely amusing, and wholly delightful game.\n\nSet in the post nuclear apocalyptic near future of 2007, and a genetic experimentation program has developed a monster called the Blood Dragon. These things are huge, strong, carnivorous beasts who shoot lasers out of their eyes. This new weapon could potentially devastate the free world, and it's up to Rex Power Colt to fight his way through them in order to put an end to the entire scheme. Half man, half machine, half can opener, and has brought enough cans of whoop-♥♥♥ for everyone in the class.\n\nThe gameplay remains largely unchanged, which is in itself probably a good thing. A lot of this game plays like a map pack. Many enemies are effectively reskinned enemies from standard Far Cry 3, with the exception of Blood Dragons, who are entirely new. You get a whole new island, with new kinds of sidequests, and also the battle for territorial control by capturing enemy outposts. Most of this will be familiar to Far Cry 3 players.\n\nWhat's new is the setting, narrative, and running theme of being a parody of action films of yesteryear. A lot of design work is clearly influenced by previous speculations of the future, with bright neon colours standing out most of all in many places. And on top of that, the lead character is voiced by Michael Biehn, of Aliens and Terminator fame, who appears to now be on the Leslie Nielson career trajectory. He's on board with this deconstruction and parody of his resume, and is fully in on the joke, to add good spirit to the whole package too.\n\nSure, some of the jokes fall flat, and resort to simply referencing. But this is very easy to look past, and certainly won't spoil the game's impression on you. Its story is a nice, compact length, with enough to do on the side to keep you busy if you want more. Most definitely worth the modest price it asks for.","March 11, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game , or rather stand-alone DLC is excellent. I would most likely rate it a 9/10. This game is pretty much a giant homage to 80's movies. You have references from RoboCop to Terminator to the animated cartoons like GI Joe and Transformers. Oh and not to mention the amazing yet horrible 80s movie Miami Connection. Also there are many more refernces like Predator, there are just so many to mention that it's hard to list them all. If you love 80s movies I think you will love this game. Even if you aren't that interested in this I think you would still love it. Also, Michael Biehn is Rex "Power" Colt so that's pretty sweet. The only downside to this game was UPlay. The game was also very short but that's because it is a stand-alone DLC. I consider this game better than the actual Far Cry 3. Oh, and also you don't even need to have the base Far Cry 3 to run it. This game/stand-alone DLC is worth every penny. I loved it you should really consider picking it up or if you've been debating then you should certainly make a purchase.","May 23, 2014","true","17.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It takes much of what Far Cry 3 does, condenses it into a smaller environment, makes everything much faster and easier to get to, makes you crazy powerful from the start, injects a crapload of style and 80's/90's referential humour into it, and offers a shorter and much easier to get into experience while giving you just enough stuff to do outside of the main story to easily justify the standalone price. Everything from the visual style to the cheesy neon environment and cyber-esque enemy designs just makes the short time spent in this game a joy. Throw in an amazing 80's style new wave/techno soundtrack from the guys at "Powerglove" and you have one of the more unique looking and sounding games of the last few years.\n\nAn easy recommendation.","March 29, 2014","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lemming77/recommended/233270/","lemming77","Lem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lemming77/","619 products in account","Far Cry 3 is already a pretty solid shooter formula. An open world for a battlefield yields all sorts of strategic opportunities, letting you dictate every little detail of how you attack each situation, all while maintaining a very clear direction and objective, all tied together by their narrative. Add to that cyberpunk themes, a sense of humor, and the best action flicks the 1980s gave us, and you get Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon. An enormously fun, genuinely amusing, and wholly delightful game.\n\nSet in the post nuclear apocalyptic near future of 2007, and a genetic experimentation program has developed a monster called the Blood Dragon. These things are huge, strong, carnivorous beasts who shoot lasers out of their eyes. This new weapon could potentially devastate the free world, and it's up to Rex Power Colt to fight his way through them in order to put an end to the entire scheme. Half man, half machine, half can opener, and has brought enough cans of whoop-♥♥♥ for everyone in the class.\n\nThe gameplay remains largely unchanged, which is in itself probably a good thing. A lot of this game plays like a map pack. Many enemies are effectively reskinned enemies from standard Far Cry 3, with the exception of Blood Dragons, who are entirely new. You get a whole new island, with new kinds of sidequests, and also the battle for territorial control by capturing enemy outposts. Most of this will be familiar to Far Cry 3 players.\n\nWhat's new is the setting, narrative, and running theme of being a parody of action films of yesteryear. A lot of design work is clearly influenced by previous speculations of the future, with bright neon colours standing out most of all in many places. And on top of that, the lead character is voiced by Michael Biehn, of Aliens and Terminator fame, who appears to now be on the Leslie Nielson career trajectory. He's on board with this deconstruction and parody of his resume, and is fully in on the joke, to add good spirit to the whole package too.\n\nSure, some of the jokes fall flat, and resort to simply referencing. But this is very easy to look past, and certainly won't spoil the game's impression on you. Its story is a nice, compact length, with enough to do on the side to keep you busy if you want more. Most definitely worth the modest price it asks for.","March 11, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You'll only get about 3 hours out of this game (more if you do collectibles) but it's a great 3 hours with an amazing ending.\n\nAs far as gameplay, imagine that Far Cry 3 got a lot less buggy, a lot less tedious, the combat got a lot more stable, and was injected with a heaping, healthy dose of FUN.  Fall damage was removed, as was the need to breathe while underwater, and you can sprint at about 30 MPH.  Everything has been given a neon tint (to emulate an old 1980s sci-fi movie) but it's never really distracting.  Overall, the dialogue and combat feel very Duke Nukem-ey.\n\nOn the negatives, the game is VERY short (3 hours on my playthrough), but it's an extremely enjoyable experience for those 3 hours.  By the end of it, you'll be feeling like a super-powered monster, able to kill almost anything in one or two hits.

I've tried to play in both online and offline mode, and don't really know what else to do, seeing as so few people have reported this. I suspect it's because most folks have moved on to new titles, and don't replay Blood Dragon as much as I do. Well... replay it as much as I did.

The main missions are also a lot better than in FC3, and the humor is also particularly self-aware and well done in a pleasingly-cheesy way.\n\nBlood Dragon will be over before it gets mind-numbingly repetitive like Far Cry 3 and its filler, so I consider it the definitive Far Cry (3) game to play. It's the only Far Cry game I've ever been able to play until completion, and consistently enjoy.","December 11, 2014","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quikblend/recommended/233270/","quikblend","quikblend","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quikblend/","545 products in account","Ok lets start off with this gem. You are Sergeant Rex Power Colt and basically you dont give any f***s. Rex Colt is on a mission to stop a mad man from arming nuclear warheads and blowing up the already destoryed world! This game is similar in fasion to Far Cry 3, but it fully embraces its silly 80's Sci-fi action. This is what makes the game fully enjoyable as an expansion. The main story line is tons of cheesy one liners and typical 80's plot twists, but still tells a convincing of enough story for you to want to play. If you were to pick up this game for the story alone, you are looking at the wrong game.\n\nThe character cast is limited to about 3-4 main characters and numerous minor characters. I will not spoil each group of MC's, but each feels completely at home in this sci-fi world Ubisoft has created. Some of the characters are your typical one dimensional 80's cheese, but that's what you WANT to expect. This game is all the cliches of the past made just for today.The characters flow into the story quiet well and it makes the game into an amazingly stupid action title. Cutscences in the game are presentated as "arcade style 32 Bit" interactions and add to the atmosphere of the working sci-fi title.\n\nThe levels that you interact with are great. It terms of size relative to Far Cry 3, it is just alittle smaller than the first island you start one. There are not alot pacing breaks.Entering buildings and having a pause to say go into a dungeon are a thing of the past. Most of the world is on the map and never take away from the game itselves. It's completely open world and thats great and bad. It's great to because you are a cyborg bad ♥♥♥ and can do whatever you want. The downside is that it lacks the depth of exploring and uncovering mysterys. They still have hidden files and items, but that alone has something lacking that Far Cry 3 had going for it. The hidden items reveal backstory on characters and thoghts. What it has that Far Cry 3 does not have are tons and tons of hidden easter eggs. I won't ruin them but when you find them you will chuckle at each and every one of them. This expansion is a single player expericence only, unlike Far Cry 3 which has some multiplayer elements.\n\nGameplay wise it is identical to Far Cry 3 minus a few things. Since you are a bad ♥♥♥ mofo cyborg you can run infinitly and you no longer take any fall damage. This is because you are a cyborg....do i really need to explain the science behind it? Moving on you get about one of each item and upgrade it with the "money" you get in the game. These futuristic guns are not only badass but become better with upgrades. Just like Far Cry 3, you will find that one or so gun that will be your bread and butter (for me it was the pistol and machine gun). The hunting is not as in depth as it was in Far Cry 3. It exists but usually as a means to upgrade your weapons or complete achievements.\n\nIn terms of replayability it is moderate to high depending on what you want to get out of it. Since this goes through UPLAY and not steam the achievements are fun to get but dont count outside of UPLAY. This count be a damper to some people, me on the other hand did not mind and still 100 percent this game. After trying to get all the achievements it is great to just run around and kill stuff or explore the island and find all the items and easter eggs. You could restart the campaign, but most people will not and be satisified with the game.\n\nThe achievements are fun and enjoyable for anyone who is a completionist. As i stated before, they count towards UPLAY achievements and not STEAM. Some could be time consuming to level up or upgrade weapons, but if you are an expericenced gamer you can get 95 percent on the first playthrough. My ranking on difficulty for getting all the achievements ranges from easy to average.\n\nThe video, audio and control layout is basically all the same as Far Cry 3. The graphics are great just like Far Cry 3, but it is a darker game with lazers and light beams lighting up the screen. This is the majority of the "light" in the game. It is suppose to be a destroyed wasteland from a nuclear war so dont expect lush bright sun effects. the audio is superb with the soundtrack taking the cake. It is one of the most memoriable soundtracks of any video game in recent history. With typical 80's sci fi movie sound and power anthems it will make your experience in this world that much more enjoyable. The layout for controls is the same but the tutorials are fun and make it easy to get back into a FPS if you have forgotten (i know you havent).\n\nMy final thoughts on Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon. This game brings back fun into a game without sacrificing too much core gameplay. it is a fun game from beginning to end without too big of hiccups of run here and do that. It is just long enough and just short enough to never feel like it stays too long in one place. The sad part is when you finally complete the game it will leave you wanting more. Many gamers will find it hard to find fault in this game and enjoy this expansion.\n\nMy overall rating for this review will be 4.5 out of 5.","June 19, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game , or rather stand-alone DLC is excellent. I would most likely rate it a 9/10. This game is pretty much a giant homage to 80's movies. You have references from RoboCop to Terminator to the animated cartoons like GI Joe and Transformers. Oh and not to mention the amazing yet horrible 80s movie Miami Connection. Also there are many more refernces like Predator, there are just so many to mention that it's hard to list them all. If you love 80s movies I think you will love this game. Even if you aren't that interested in this I think you would still love it. Also, Michael Biehn is Rex "Power" Colt so that's pretty sweet. The only downside to this game was UPlay. The game was also very short but that's because it is a stand-alone DLC. I consider this game better than the actual Far Cry 3. Oh, and also you don't even need to have the base Far Cry 3 to run it. This game/stand-alone DLC is worth every penny. I loved it you should really consider picking it up or if you've been debating then you should certainly make a purchase.","May 23, 2014","true","17.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You'll only get about 3 hours out of this game (more if you do collectibles) but it's a great 3 hours with an amazing ending.\n\nAs far as gameplay, imagine that Far Cry 3 got a lot less buggy, a lot less tedious, the combat got a lot more stable, and was injected with a heaping, healthy dose of FUN.  Fall damage was removed, as was the need to breathe while underwater, and you can sprint at about 30 MPH.  Everything has been given a neon tint (to emulate an old 1980s sci-fi movie) but it's never really distracting.  Overall, the dialogue and combat feel very Duke Nukem-ey.\n\nOn the negatives, the game is VERY short (3 hours on my playthrough), but it's an extremely enjoyable experience for those 3 hours.  By the end of it, you'll be feeling like a super-powered monster, able to kill almost anything in one or two hits.  I found this to be pretty boring, because then the combat just got tedious instead of challenging.  Still, I loved this game, and I can't wait for the sequel.","July 22, 2013","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

If you haven't, get it anyways. This is the game comes straight from the 70s, 80s, and 90s all rolled into one, to give us a neon-filled, nostalgia-fuelled cyber-shooter. You play as a cyber commando, fighting other cyber commandos, and there are DRAGONS WITH FRICKIN' LASERS IN THEIR EYES. Lots of fun references, including Robocop and Predator, hilarious dialogue and jokes, and probably some of the funniest writing outisde of the Borderlands series. However, combat can often get repetitive with the many garrisons that you have to raid. Also, you can't fly a helicopter, but you drive something much better that I cannot say without ruining some ascpect of the game. Probably the one and only real problem that I've had with this game was that it was launched through UPlay. It just gets in the way.

Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","261 products in account","Neon Nightmare: Hottub Miami\n\nI think the weapon description for the Bow encapsulates this entire game perfectly. While I can't remember the entire paragraph, one sentence basically reads: ''It has Neon, therefore its a bow of the future''. The description summarizes two things about this title: it has a ♥♥♥♥load of neon, which means its an 80's dystopian vision of the future; it's really laid back and almost comedic in its approach to everything. At one point in the game your concierge tells you about something and how you have to accomplish a task, and our protagonist is left confused and wondering what the hell she's talking about or what's going on. Her response? ''Oh, I didn't tell you about that?''. It immediately became obvious that the creators didn't want you to overthink the plot or worry about the details. Just kill ♥♥♥♥.\n\nGameplay boils down to taking over bases, doing the unlocked missions (usually two, sometimes one) after taking control of the garisson, and finding collectibles. Collectibles are worth it, since they unlock weapon upgrades. Unfair? Not really, since you can, after freeing up a set amount of garissons, unlock maps in the store that display locations of collectibles on the map. Does that make collectibles ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, since they TELL YOU where they are? Nah, my take on it is that they're set up so that you travel the island, encountering enemies and dragons along the way. It's not finding them that matters, its getting to them.\n\nEven with the side quests its a short title, so you'd think it has very little to offer. In fact, it's pretty much a bite-size version of Far Cry 3, with neon and a ♥♥♥♥♥in' 80's soundtrack. The latter makes it worthwhile; the game has enough style and personality of its own to be a fruitful endeavour. It doesn't overstay its welcome, carries itself comedically and refuses to take anything it does seriously. If you've played Far Cry 3 before, odds are you've seen a lot of this already. But the new paint is good looking enough to warrant a second drive through the much smaller island of Blood Dragon. If you HAVEN'T played a Far Cry title before, ♥♥♥♥ing buy this already. For veterans its familiar territory, albeit with a different coat of paint. But for newbies, it's an enticingly retro foray into open world first person shooting. Whether a veteran or a newcomer, capturing bases stealthily is still as fun as ever. But now you get to do it to sounds of the 80's.","May 3, 2014","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The music and sound effects are amazingly synthesized.  The cutscenes are similar to Ninja Gaiden for NES.  Gameplay is pretty much the same as Far Cry 3.  Your character has to go around and liberate bases, do sidequests for weapon attachments, and kill stuff to level up.  The main story doesn't take long to complete, but is more satisfying than Far Cry 3.

Everything about this game screams nostalgia: a protganist name like Rex Power Colt, dialogue so (intentionally) cheesey that even Snake Pliskin would cringe, and stylistic still-image cutscenes not scene in a decade. All of this utilizing the immensely enjoyable framework of exploring an open world and choosing your playstyle seen in Far Cry 3. The story is straight out of the 80's, with an ending that is nigh perfect for a game such as this.\n\nThe guns, when fully upgraded, are immensely satisfying to use; the shotgun and sniper become stupidly overpowered (even on Hard) but it does a lot of work to get there. The real challenge comes from using stealth to get in close to the enemy, marking them all in order to keep track, and then blitzing through them with your takedowns, being able to take out entire groups in the blink of an eye should you possess the skill. The blood dragons you will encounter cannot be so easily slain, and they take patience and methodical approach to kill just one even with a fully upgraded character (on Hard).\n\nOverall, it's a game worth dedicating the day or two it will take to compelte. It's a game that doesn't take itself seriously without being as wacky as games such as Saints Row 4 (though it does come close at times). The only obvious downside is how shallow and short the experience feels, particularly in the postgame, as it does not offer much replay value unless you really enjoy it. However it's cheap so that can be forgiven. Worth the buy if you loved 80s action movies, and worth a look even if you dont.","February 24, 2014","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a fun sight to see a big game developer sidetrack and go absolutely bonkers with its franchise and that is what FC3 - Blood dragon is, absolutely bonkerville. Delightfully crazy 80s influenced futuristic action packed fast paced first person shooting trip filled with lots of references to popular movies and a soundtrack well suited for the whole setting. Love it!\n\nLike with Far Cry 3, I had very little problems with Far Cry 3 - Blood dragon (works with same engine, duh). It's a lot shorter experience but the price simultaneously is much lower and you don't need to have the original Far Cry 3 to play Blood Dragon. If you hate the 80s, corny remarks, one liners and references and you don't like fast paced shooting or alternatively slowly hiding and stabbing people or shooting arrows to your foes heads then the game definitely isn't for you.

Not only featuring smooth gameplay and stunning visuals, the game's story, atmosphere, and writing combine to create a post-modernist satire of the past era for those of today. One doesn't have to be born in the 80's to see how every detail- from the animations of the Omega Force to the way Rex Power-Colt swims- combine to form a hilarious satire of the nuclear-future-obsessed films of the Reagan age. The game is also enjoyed in other languages, where the acting is always superb. (A character in the game retains his Japanese accent in all five dubbed languages.) This is a game on my must play list.

However, it grew on me (like a tumah!) and by the game's insane, over the top conclusion I was unironically fist pumping right along side it.  I also ended up appreciating the game's condensed length.  Most open world games drag on longer than the expiration date of their mechanics - but you can 100% Blood Dragon in under 8 hours and that's precisely the right amount of time to spend with the game.","September 14, 2013","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hey, call me old school if you will, I'm just that cool (Sorry again, i'm actually not that cool). But action is non-stop and fast-paced. And you can play "Halo" two different styles ( Really this game is exactly like Halo, except not in space, has dragons instead of Grunts, and it doesn't have flippin MASTER CHIEF!!! BIGGEST COMPLAINANT RIGHT THERE!!! ) Stealth, or Guns-a-Blazzin. No matter which style you play Blood Dragon it's going to be a blast.

Everything about this game screams nostalgia: a protganist name like Rex Power Colt, dialogue so (intentionally) cheesey that even Snake Pliskin would cringe, and stylistic still-image cutscenes not scene in a decade. All of this utilizing the immensely enjoyable framework of exploring an open world and choosing your playstyle seen in Far Cry 3. The story is straight out of the 80's, with an ending that is nigh perfect for a game such as this.\n\nThe guns, when fully upgraded, are immensely satisfying to use; the shotgun and sniper become stupidly overpowered (even on Hard) but it does a lot of work to get there. The real challenge comes from using stealth to get in close to the enemy, marking them all in order to keep track, and then blitzing through them with your takedowns, being able to take out entire groups in the blink of an eye should you possess the skill. The blood dragons you will encounter cannot be so easily slain, and they take patience and methodical approach to kill just one even with a fully upgraded character (on Hard).\n\nOverall, it's a game worth dedicating the day or two it will take to compelte. It's a game that doesn't take itself seriously without being as wacky as games such as Saints Row 4 (though it does come close at times). The only obvious downside is how shallow and short the experience feels, particularly in the postgame, as it does not offer much replay value unless you really enjoy it. However it's cheap so that can be forgiven. Worth the buy if you loved 80s action movies, and worth a look even if you dont.","February 24, 2014","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I saw this on the horizon, and to be honest, I thought it'd be awful: a gimmicky tie-in that looked absolutely ridiculous.  And it is absolutely ridiculous.  But it is impossibly well executed!  Don't get me wrong, Far Cry 3 was a fantastic game but there were things that made the game just a wee bit tedious at times - impossibly sensitive fall damage, some skills that just seemed pointless, swimming sections.\n\nBlood Dragon streamlines all the realism (because this game leaves all reason at the door) in favor of making the game fun.  The plot is ridiculous and a lovely send-up of all those glorious 80s sci-fi/action movies - and who better to provide the voice for the main character than 80s action hero luminary, Michael Biehn (see: Terminator, Aliens)?  He's more grizzled here in the distant future of 2013 (when the game came out), but holy crap, he is phenomenal with the voice work and his one-liners and dialogue that he delivers throughout the game make it so much more viscerally enjoyable to run around like a commando - scratch that, CYBER Commando - all over the island.  Yeah, you're on an island like in Far Cry 3 and this one's much smaller, has an 80s VHS tracking haze that I'm not complaining about because it goes with the theme, and everything is muted or neon.  Why? Because it's awesome, that's why.  If you don't understand that perhaps you and your haughty airs might enjoy a nice quiet evening listening to NPR.\n\nSo yeah, fall damage is gone, you can breathe forever in water and run pretty much as fast as you could drive a car making getting around the island a breeze.  The enemy types are a bit lacking since they basically fall into the categories of 1) palette-swapped wild animals from FC3, 2) Motocross guy with an assault rifle 3) Welder-mask guy with molotovs 4) Heavy weapons guy with a minigun or flamethrower or 5) the eponymous blood dragons.   And while there's some gauntlets and set-piece missions you'll play through, there aren't really any 'boss fights' to speak of unless you count fighting blood dragons or conquering outposts.\n\nThose are really the only negatives I experienced in this game and they don't detract too much from the fun you have playing an avatar of death known as Rex 'Power' Colt.  Play Far Cry 3, appreciate the beauty and realism and survival challenge.  After you do that, play this game for the fun and sense of empowerment as all of Jason Brody's weaknesses are eliminated for the sake of having a good old 80's action movie complete with cheesy but fun dialogue, 16-bit cutscenes, and dinosaurs that shoot lasers out of their eyes.","February 12, 2014","true","121.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For those of you who see modern cartoons that lack the macho hero, the two-dimensional love interest, and the evil cyborg who wants to control the world.

I would 9 times out of 10 prefer these types of content being released instead of just selling me garbage like skins and unlock packs for stuff I was already going to unlock in the first place.\n\nFar Cry 3: Blood Dragon is exactly what it says on the tin.  If the premise of everything that made the original Far Cry 3 great given an 80s twist in just about every way interests you, this DLC has everything you need down to the cheesy plot, one-liners, 80s synthpop, almost offensive proportions of neon coloring, references, and overall design.\n\nIt is absolutely silly and everything in it is silly and it knows this, reaching Saints Row levels of absurdity in many places.  Much akin to SR, this game is all about having all the sorts of stupid fun with ridiculous laser weapons with dumb amounts of attachments on them and enemies such as the titular Blood Dragons.\n\nThe gameplay is still the same stuff you're used to from FC3, with unlocking weapons and attachments by way of finding collectables and taking over outposts.  Some improvements and changes have been made particularly to suit the nature of the game, particularly the removal of the crafting system and streamlined leveling and skill acquisition as opposed to using FC3's skill trees.\n\nIt's short and sweet, clocking in at about 10 hours average for most people completing it 100%, which is fantastic given the game's $15 price point.  It's stand-alone too, so you don't even need to own the base game on Steam to play this.\n\nThe only downsides I really have to address are that the heavy amounts of visual filters and neon lights actually do start to get old after a few hours and might even start hurting your eyes.  There was also a lack of a proper final boss fight, in which they opted to have the endgame simply being a long shooting sequence.  Oh, and obviously the Uplay requirement.  This goes without saying, though.\n\nDespite those things, I can totally recommend this even at its full price and it's definitely worth checking out in the future when it's on sale, whether you've never played FC3 before or just want more of the same gameplay with a different flavor to it.\n\n","May 2, 2013","true","30.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

It takes much of what Far Cry 3 does, condenses it into a smaller environment, makes everything much faster and easier to get to, makes you crazy powerful from the start, injects a crapload of style and 80's/90's referential humour into it, and offers a shorter and much easier to get into experience while giving you just enough stuff to do outside of the main story to easily justify the standalone price. Everything from the visual style to the cheesy neon environment and cyber-esque enemy designs just makes the short time spent in this game a joy. Throw in an amazing 80's style new wave/techno soundtrack from the guys at "Powerglove" and you have one of the more unique looking and sounding games of the last few years.\n\nAn easy recommendation.","March 29, 2014","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Granted that it's not even a full Triple AAA title like it's brother FarCry 3. This is a spinoff, one of the best I will say, that the developers threw together just to let you have some fun. The story is as cliche as it is today, but in the 80s that's all we ever cared about. Get the girl, kill the bad guys, kill some dragons also and save the post-apocalyptic world from an evil, rogue general bent on the theory of his theme "SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST." It is a damn fine game to play though not a very long one. I have completed all the side quests, main campaign, and even got all the collectibles and opening the boxes littered across the map under 12 hours. The only cons I can think of is that there is no multiplayer and MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING uPlay. Did I also mention there are MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME BADASS DRAGONS SHOOTING LASERS OUT OF THEIR EYES? Neon lights, neon animals and more neon than you can ever think of compared to the 80s.\n\nGr8 Game m8 i r8 it 8/8","March 23, 2015","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The colour sceme is fantastic the punch-lines hit spot on and It's so different from the original it gives you a new experiance even if you think nothing can be better than the 3rd please play this game.Allowing to own this game and not have to own the original was a good idea purely for convienence.The tutorial knows its a tutorial and then knowingly says how annoying it is to have a tutorial in your game and the bases ofer great stealth and then guns blazing tactics.The animals fun and inventive including the Blood Dragon.Speaking of wich the ability to turn off the enemy's shields and watch a dinosaur the size of an Elephant run in shooting lazers out of it's eyes Is one of the funniest things In the game.Of course it has the exact same mechanics as farcry3 as expected, but one thing I was Dissapointed to find was the lack of weapons.There is some customisation with the mods for the weapons but once you get the max there's no point trying the older upgrades wich is a large flaw in an open world FPS.I never played it After i finished the game As there's no point, it's increddibly easy to find the collectables and after that there's nothing to do the challenges are fun but few and I'd only recomend it for Its humour, visuals and story.All in all a good game but lack of content, I know its a DLC but you don't have to have the original so i'll count it as half a game.I'll give it a 8/10 A good game and i'd reccomend it to gamers who like FPS's, Gamers who like Sci-fi and Gamers who like the original farcry3 but want something new","May 30, 2014","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What makes Blood Dragon awesome is the re-skinning of all the assets and narrative. It's a joyous romp through 80's clichés, one-liners and neon lights with a persistant tongue-in-cheek humour throughout from the loading screens to the menus to the call-outs when you get a kill. If there is anything to pick at, aside from the faults of Far Cry 3's engine, it would be the length because Blood Dragon is quite short.","October 17, 2013","true","49.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't mean I think "That was unique. I'm glad I played it." I mean, I find a game that is fun, immersive, and so far up my alley that I beat the game before I get enough. Blood Dragon is that game, and I want another one. Blood Dragon is a shortened version of Far Cry 3 but with a theme that is the totality of rad from every 80s action movie ever combined into one. The year is 2007, and you have survived an apocalyptic nuclear winter between the U.S. and the USSR that crescendoed in the 1980s. You play as a Michael Biehn cyborg (ironic seeing how he fought one in the Terminator) and are trying to stop a Cobra Commander type of villain from sending his army of cyborg soldiers out to enslave mankind and rule what's left of the world. The action is awesome, the controls are great, the fetch quests are addicting and everything I've ever wanted in a soundtrack or action movie is here. My only two complaints are that the game was too short and that there was no final battle with the final boss (just a cutscene). Overall, I was extremely satisfied and am considering checking out the other Far Cry games.","September 5, 2013","true","26.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's both a parody and a tribute of the 80's,  with a strange future timeline, based on the Far Cry 3 engine, and most of the same island. WIth a dark atmosphere you can't really tell it's the same island, and the neon decor (reminiscent of Tron) and the overly dramatic delivery of the heros, villains, and other characters, makes for one heck of a presentation.\n\nYou play Rex Power Colt, Mk IV Cybercommando of the US Military. Recently rebuilt / recovered from serious injuries and upgraded to Mk IV, you are sent with a buddy commando to infiltrate enemy compound to retrieve computer data... Only to discover the defending forces were commanded by your ex-commander, Colonel Sloan. However, you have someone helping you: Dr. Darling, someone forced to help Sloan develope this "dragon blood", which supercharged his cybernetics, making him more powerful than ever.\n\nYou start as a level 1. As you achieve objectives, make kills, and so on you will gain XP which will let you gain levels, and additional skills and additional health points. Max level is 30, and the progression table is fixed, i.e. you can't choose which power.\n\nThere are only so many weapons: pistol, assault rifle, sniper rifle, shotgun, minigun, blade, bow, grenade, molotox, mine, and C400 (satchel charge). But some weapons can be upgraded by attachments, which are unlocked through collecting collectibles.\n\nThe actual game mechanics are identical to Far Cry 3: take over outposts by killing everybody inside, preferably without being discovered. Once you liberate an outpost Scientists loyal to Dr. Darling will move in. You can still do takedowns, and you already know how to do takedown drag and chain takedowns, but the advanced moves like grenade takedown,  shuriken takedown, pistol takedown, as well as death from above, and death from below are activated later.\n\nAnimals are now mutated into strange forms, like cybercroc, cybershark, cyberpanther, etc. as well as tiger, cassowary, boar, goat, and more.\n\nThen there's the game's namesake: blood dragon. Practically small dinosaurs, they also have some really fancy ability: shoot lasers out of their eyes. Yep. It's their blood that supercharged Sloan, and killing them can be extremely tough, but doable.\n\nScattered on the island are "TV Sets" that contains additional information about Omega Force, some "VHS Tapes" you have to 'rent' (i.e. collect) with horrible movie premises, and Dr. Darling's research notes. Collecting them unlocks weapon attachments that you can buy at the "vending machine" found in each outpost.\n\nMuch like Far Cry 3, you will find the scientists fighting with the Omega Force on the island, as well as with the creatures. It is up to you if you want to interfere.\n\nEntire game is full of 80's pop culture references. You'll spot things from Star Wars, GI Joe, Aliens, and much much more. There's also jokes referring to other games, such as Far Cry 3, Assassin's Creed (collecting flags and feathers, hahahah), and much more.\n\nEven the music is done in the 80's pop rock style.\n\nAnd let's just say the beginning and ending are hilarious enough you may LOL or even ROFL. And it must be experienced in person. It can't really be explained.\n\nAll in all, Blood Dragon is a fun game with familiar mechanics, very different visuals, and callout to the 80's, and you should play it.","July 30, 2015","true","31.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Infact, I'm going to go ahead and get my small complaints out of the way early so I can spend the rest of this review going balls deep:  It sucks that there are so few weapons.  You get new attachements, and they can really alter the way the weapon works, but there are only actually a handful of death implements.  This bothers me  because  A.) The sheer amount of guns there are in Fc3, and B.) Because of how ♥♥♥♥ing cool potential weapons could have been.  The guns that are in the game are simply common archetypes - there's a shotty, sniper, AR, etc.  That's not necessarily an issue, but given how creative the rest of the game is, I can't help but hold it to a high standard.\n\nNow on to the good stuff.\n\nI'm going to tell you the very moment I fell in love with this game.  I had just loaded it up, watched a truly sick cutscene and sprayed down a bunch of future cyberninjas with a helicopter mounted minigun.  The helicopter lands, and I receive a comm message informing me that the tutorial is starting. Without missing a beat, my character screams " I ♥♥♥♥ING HATE TUTORIALS ".\n\n\nHilarious though it was, this moment is also very significant.  It's Blood Dragon's way of letting you know exactly what it is, and what to expect, right as the game starts.  It is a fun spinoff of a popular game franchise.  It is not DLC.  It is not an expansion pack.  It is a stand alone experience that doesn't take itself to seriously.  It is a love letter to the movies, stories and games that many of us grew up on. It is charming, it is gorgeous, and it is incredibly engaging.\n\n\nYou take control of a cybernetic super soldier tasked with unraveling the defection of your former superiour officer.  The story itself is pretty cookie cutter, but the way it is told is anything but.  Cutscenes are an anachronistic fusion between the 8-bit era and modern flair.  Though the story failed to captivate me, the dialogue was frequently a highlight.  Blood Dragon thrives on it's unique brand of tongue-in-cheek humor.\n\n\nStorywise - zero carry over from anything Far Cry, but there are quite a few similarities in the gameplay.  There are animals to hunt, there are unlockables to find and missions often play out exactly like clearing a compound in Far Cry 3.  The bones of it are the same, but not quite as deep (understandable, given the games bargain price point).  Aiming is almost exactly the same as FC3 - there is still that kind of "floaty" element to it which usually necessitates aiming down the sights to hit a shot.   There are not as many weapons to unlock, but the level of upgrades available for your arsenal per weapon is much improved.  Your relationship with your weaponry is a lot more intimate, and doing missions to earn these upgrades will be where you'll spend a lot of your time.\n\n\nAs a gamer, the thing that I find most appealing is atmosphere.  This isn't something that can be quantified, nor is it the result of any one thing.  It is the pervasive feeling you have while playing the game.  Blood Dragon has a very unique and powerful atmosphere.  The neon juxtaposed by the darkness of the island itself is amazing.  Running in terror from the eponymous Blood Dragon's (or alternatively using them as attack dogs) is a thrill.  Using your cyber ninja stars/samurai sword for stealth kill combos just feels right.  Watching a cyber ninja's head explode in electric sparks after a perfect headshot is satisfaction squared.  All of these things contribute to atmosphere, but they are only parts of the whole.\n\n\nThe thing that I love most about Blood Dragon is that it exists.  That a triple-a game studio like Ubisoft let their employees run wild and create something that was fun to them is incredible to me.  It isn't a (true) sequel, it isn't made to nickel and dime you, it was a bunch of people creating something cool for the joy of it.  This more than anything speaks to the feel of the game.  The soul of fun and creativity is apparent in literally every part and every moment of FarCry3: Blood Dragon.  I cannot recommend it enough, and I hope that we see more of its kind.\n\n8.5/10","December 16, 2013","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

HELL YES!)\n* Awesome soundtrack\n* DRAGONS with laser eyes\n* Cyborg sharks\n\nCons:\n* Kinda short (I completed it 100% in about 14 hours)\n* Sometimes it tries too hard with the satire\n* Not enough enemy variety\n* I found it fairly easy, even on Hard\n* UPlay account required (womp womp)","June 19, 2014","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not only featuring smooth gameplay and stunning visuals, the game's story, atmosphere, and writing combine to create a post-modernist satire of the past era for those of today. One doesn't have to be born in the 80's to see how every detail- from the animations of the Omega Force to the way Rex Power-Colt swims- combine to form a hilarious satire of the nuclear-future-obsessed films of the Reagan age. The game is also enjoyed in other languages, where the acting is always superb. (A character in the game retains his Japanese accent in all five dubbed languages.)

It mocks pretty much everything that revolves around cheesy movie elements (lines, story, characters etc.) and other 80's related business.\nThe game doesn't overstay its welcome with about 4 hours of an enjoyable story. Of course, should you choose to do so, you do have the option of doing various side-missions (hunting, outposts..) and collecting collectables.\n\nAlso, NO RADIO TOWERS. Hooray!\n\nThe game is open world, however the map is smaller than that of Far Cry 3, and you are much less encouraged to actually explore it since it's packed with a short story that expects you to follow it during your time playing the game and doesn't tell you or show you much regarding other open world related activities.\nOf course exploring it can be (and is) fun nonetheless.\n\nCons: Uplay / supporting Ubisoft.\n\nOther than that, it's an experience worth having.

The rest is two types of side quests; Rescue a scientist or hunt an animal type, Liberating outposts, And collecting TV's, Tapes, and Files, which DOES unlock weapon stuff so it's worthwhile.

For those of you who see modern cartoons that lack the macho hero, the two-dimensional love interest, and the evil cyborg who wants to control the world. The shows that take themselves too seriously and are slathered with so many unsubtle moral messages they make no sense. For those of you who have had their experience ruined by modern storytelling and adult cynicism.\nThis game is your outlet.\nEverything you miss about those old cartoons and action heroes.\nCrammed with references to series I never thought I'd hear about again (And some I never have, I'm sure), characters ripped straight out of more of the same, and a soundtrack so full of 80's synth you'll have flashbacks.\nAnd of course, more one-liners than I've heard from Arnie, Stalone, and Van Damme.\nCombined.\nBlood Dragon's action and story moments are what you're here for. A barebones kill-the-bad-guy plot that's not about who you're after, but how you take him down, and how everything explodes nonsensically along the way.\nThe gameplay is simple enough to understand, effectively identical to Far Cry. For those not familiar with it, don't panic. It's a brilliant system reknowned for attention to realistic detail that plays well into the action-movie aesthetic Blood Dragon draws from. Even some of the weapons here are movie references.\nPerhaps the strangest part of Blood Dragon is the moments between its story and combat that provide moments for reflection, particularly with the travel methods taken from the Far Cry series.\nIt is in these moments that you are likely to notice Blood Dragon's flaws, of which there are very, very few.\nPerhaps the most voiced flaw of Blood Dragon is the requirement of a UPlay acount to play Blood Dragon, as it is a Ubisoft game. This can be a valid concern, as loss of any account details can mean a lack of access to the game and requirement of technical support. Every buyer should take care in setting up their UPlay account if they do not have one already. The experience of Blood Dragon is too good to ruin with haphazard account setup, and is most definitely worth it.\n\nThe first of the game's ACTUAL arguable flaws is its length. Blood Dragon is definitely not a very long game, and after your first full playthrough, you're likely to notice that there is nothing else out there except a week long 80's movie marathon that can come close to the feeling of your first Blood Dragon playthrough. Which is it's second flaw, the difficulty in defining why Blood Dragon captures its nostalgic essence so well can make it difficult to find anything like Blood Dragon except... More Blood Dragon. Or trying to watch Jonny Quest and Terminator at the same time while posing Dino Riders figures.\nBesides the possibility of account issues, Blood Dragon's only downfall as a standalone game may be that there isn't more of it. Or that it's not a war simulator that's been rehashed twelve times for its multiplayer.\n\nBlood Dragon delivers where a lot of games fail, making your protagonist a certified hero you WANT to play as. Rex 'Powers' Colt has no flaws, except maybe that he's TOO badass.\nAnd he's voiced by Michael Bien, who might not be the BEST known action star, but he's the hero from Terminator. And he's in Aliens, so Rex Colt really IS an 80's action hero.\n\nAnyone who feels a pang of nostalgia the moment someone mentions aliens of any kind, has a fear of man-eating sharks with uninspired names, or says 'I'll be back.' without even the slightest hint of an Austrian accent will find a moment of solace in Blood Dragon.","December 31, 2013","true","33.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You need to go through all the hassle of creating exceptions for your firewall for uPlay and register an account. It needs to be active all the time you're playing, and if you are a smart enough user to not play on your administrator account (as you should), you'll be bugged to enter your administrator password each and every time you start the game.\n\nAbout the game itself, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is a console game and it shows. You cannot bind anything to the mousewheel, all the audio is incredibly quiet even with the volume on max and no way to increase it. The menus and interface are a complete mess with unintuitive controls, open and close slowly and the only thing they succeed at is making you want to use them as little as possible. You have only a single save slot per game, you cannot replay any particular level if you ever want to, and you can't even save when on a mission. Every time a wild animal catches you, you get a quicktime event, which usually leads to your death because the keys it requires you to spam are different every time.\n\nThe content of the game itself is pretty well designed. It's a parody game using pretty much every known cliché of the 80s/90s action movies in an 80s future vision setting.\nMost of the weapons are fun to use, though some require you to unlock and buy upgrades to not be useless, such as explosive ammo for the sniper rifle.\nYou are dropped on an island where you can roam around as you please, follow the main story, side quests or do whatever. While I generally like games with an open world, I feel there is some lack of direction. STALKER games have shown how to do an open world properly while still maintaining a good sense of direction.\n\nA big plus of Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is the music. It's one of the best soundtracks heard in computer gaming and fits the general theme of the game perfectly. Now if only it wasn't so damn quiet you could barely hear anything...\n\nAll in all, this is a good FPS plagued by some issues around it. I feel that the positives of the game, mainly the setting, music and over-the-top action hero theme, outweight the negatives and make it worth playing.","January 15","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you haven't, get it anyways. This is the game comes straight from the 70s, 80s, and 90s all rolled into one, to give us a neon-filled, nostalgia-fuelled cyber-shooter. You play as a cyber commando, fighting other cyber commandos, and there are DRAGONS WITH FRICKIN' LASERS IN THEIR EYES. Lots of fun references, including Robocop and Predator, hilarious dialogue and jokes, and probably some of the funniest writing outisde of the Borderlands series. However, combat can often get repetitive with the many garrisons that you have to raid. Also, you can't fly a helicopter, but you drive something much better that I cannot say without ruining some ascpect of the game. Probably the one and only real problem that I've had with this game was that it was launched through UPlay. It just gets in the way.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serendone/recommended/233270/","serendone","Serendone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serendone/","675 products in account","Far Cry 3 gets the "non-serious and reference-filled" treatment with this expansion. Even though it takes place on an open world like its base game, Blood Dragon has been simplified, streamlined, and cleaned up quite a bit. When you're not engaging in the batshit crazy story, you're capturing garrisons and collecting collectibles. Being able to sprint infinitely and quickly combined with no fall damage makes for a game that's less about the world around you and more about you: a cyborg out for blue neon blood.\n\nAs mentioned, the story is crazy. Unfortunately, most of it hides behind cutscenes that, while nicely-drawn and humrous, are ridiculously long. Like, seven-second pauses in between each line. You won't miss any plot if you skip these, but you might miss little nuggets of good writing.\n\nAlso of issue are the titular Blood Dragons. While cool-looking and initially fearsome, you'll get enough firepower during your travels to turn them into more of a nuisance than a terror-inspiring boss. The other enemies you'll come accross, cyber-soldiers and cyber-animals, don't put up much of a fight unless they're in big numbers. Despite this, combat is still pretty satisfying, and the game stays true to the goal of making you feel like a badass.\n\nIf you don't like Uplay, then I've got bad news for you: you need to install Uplay and create an Ubisoft account to play this game (assuming you haven't done either of those already). Uplay isn't really a pain to get set-up, and there's no always-online requirement, but it does add another weird layer to playing this game and it's one more program I have to install on my computer when I'd prefer to keep it as lean and clean as possible.\n\nAll in all, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is a fun halfway between linear and open-world, with lots of ways to approach enemies and a fairly formidable enemy in the Blood Dragons. It's the perfect length for an expansion and the setting is well-crafted, albeit hampered by an absurdly slow narrative.","July 26, 2014","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game was a real trip... Mindblowingly awesome soundtrack, great visuals, awesome PC port. Took around 8 hours to complete from beginning to end, so a good value for the money.

It mocks pretty much everything that revolves around cheesy movie elements (lines, story, characters etc.) and other 80's related business.\nThe game doesn't overstay its welcome with about 4 hours of an enjoyable story. Of course, should you choose to do so, you do have the option of doing various side-missions (hunting, outposts..) and collecting collectables.\n\nAlso, NO RADIO TOWERS. Hooray!\n\nThe game is open world, however the map is smaller than that of Far Cry 3, and you are much less encouraged to actually explore it since it's packed with a short story that expects you to follow it during your time playing the game and doesn't tell you or show you much regarding other open world related activities.\nOf course exploring it can be (and is) fun nonetheless.\n\nCons: Uplay / supporting Ubisoft.\n\nOther than that, it's an experience worth having. Especially considering you can have the game for less than $4 during sales.","October 17, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
