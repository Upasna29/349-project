Recommended to all lovers of classic-style point-&-click adventure games!\n\n\n\nPros:\n\n- The protagonist. Alfie Banks is not your average all-good/all-bad hero: he is quite an interesting character in himself.\n\n- The setting. 1920's in all their glory - not many games deal with that time period now. If you love 'edutainment' genre, you would be delighted to meet many historical persons and listen to the author's elaborate commentaries. If not - just enjoy the time travel.\n\n- The ending. Why, the plot has many surprises for you! And I would not spoil them here.\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n- The game is very linear. You may have a choice as for which one of 'The Three Tasks'(TM) you do first, but almost none of your actions have any impact on the course of the events (besides a couple of extra achievements).\n\n- It is definitely the most easy game published by WadjetEye. You never have to wonder what to do next, and different puzzles you meet are very simple ones. Not that it is a huge disadvantage or something, but it is rather strange to see that after 'Resonance' or 'Primordia'.","October 9, 2014","true","4.5"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","30","35","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/recommended/307570/","drmircow","Dr. Mircow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/","677 products in account","A Golden Wake is an old-school point-and-click adventure game developed by a small group of individuals and published by the renowned Wadjet Eye Games; famous for similar types of games developed in the AGS engine such as the Blackwell franchise.\n\nFirstly, A Golden Wake is set in a rather unique setting which is hardly ever used in video games; and that is in the state of Florida, all the way back in the 1920s. The choice of setting is due to the story revolving around at the height of the period’s Land Boom.  In fact, the story is based on real-life events with a few deliberate artistic emancipations here and there. Right from the start, this aspect of the game already makes it quite appealing as its setting is very refreshing.\n\nYou take the role of Alfred Banks (also simply called Alfie), a young real-estate agent trying to follow in his father’s footsteps and make his name big in this market. Initially working in New York, he eventually relocates in Miami the moment he hears the news about this real-estate boom taking place there and so begins taking part in the new Coral Gables project. Throughout the story split into chapters, you see Alfie’s life turning into a rollercoaster as he discovers both the ups and down of the market (subsequently his job) and how badly corruption can affect even your closest friends and family members. Although the game is very short in length, some of the narrative manages to make the player feel some sort of sympathy for Alfie by the end of it all in a very condensed time.\n\nAs far as old-school adventure games are concerned, A Golden Wake is graphically adequate and as expected from a game developed using the AGS engine, even though some of the drawn backgrounds can lack finer details. But they can be very colourful and the game does a good job in capturing the time period quite nicely. The soundtrack, much like the game’s aesthetics, is another aspect which the game does superbly well in emulating that authentic jazzy feeling of the ‘20s.\n\nAnd that is as much praise the game can receive up to this point as the rest of it is sadly riddled with many flaws ranging from lacklustre design choices to uninteresting writing. While the premise of the story is in actual fact interesting, the narrative eventually becomes, for a lack of a better word, dull -- even justifiably sloppy. This is partly due to the lack of engaging dialogues and fleshed out support characters as Alfie is the only character you would ever care about or feel attached to throughout the game’s story. But even then, through all the troubles he has to face, some of the actions written for him by the developers can seem occasionally implausible or inconsistent. In fact, Alfie is without a shadow of a doubt the best character and in turn the best part of the plot, although that is not saying much in a relatively depthless storyline. From start to finish, you will be able to see how certain events change his life forever, even if you sort of end up "watching" these said events rather than directly causing them in the process. And that latter part is another problem tied to the writing quality in general. It just is not on par with other adventure games and simply puts forward nothing new in a way to at least make itself stand out to some degree.\n\nBut perhaps the most obvious flaw in the game is the design of the “puzzles”. Their solutions are very obvious, arbitrary and even somewhat insulting to seasoned fans of the genre. It can be argued that these so called “puzzles” should not even be called puzzles. Then what is the point of playing a point-and-click adventure game when neither the game’s plot nor narrative is its strongest aspect to at least compensate for this puzzle design? Not only that, but a few fairly inventive puzzle mechanics such as when you attempt to make a sales pitch to a crowd are either used only once throughout the entire game or were implemented in a uninspiring way.\n\nAnd that leads to the next flaw: linearity. Indeed, it is true that the point-and-click genre is infamous for being linear thanks to being a more of story-driven medium, but that does not mean that some form of variety, or choices, should not be included. While the game does manage to offer some moments where you seem to be able to approach things in different orders, even as an illusion, these are very few in between. Going to A, B, C and then D is sufficient in completing a chapter in the game’s story. It basically works just like that. The problem here is clearly that it feels too blatantly linear than it should be.\n\nThen the voice acting can also be hit-and-miss in places, although full credit has to be given to Alfie’s voice actor who singlehandedly put on a stellar performance; he simply overshadowed everyone else.\n\nIn conclusion, A Golden Wake is a very casual adventure game. It ends up offering an interesting premise with a great soundtrack and nice looking old-school aesthetics, but with lots of potential wasted due to mindboggling easy “puzzles” (or simply lack of actual puzzles), a strict linearity and a story which starts slowly, gets bland halfway through and ends too soon. Not much backbone in there really. At the end of the day, it is a by-the-numbers adventure game with nothing ambitious about it. At its current price, it misses a recommendation. Even on a Steam sale I would be cautious recommending this unless you like supporting the indie scene. It is easily the weakest game published by Wadjet Eye which produced far superior and more striving adventure games than this game could ever offer. If there is one word to summarise the game as a whole that would be “mundane”, almost to a point where I would fall asleep on my chair.","December 22, 2015","false","4.8"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","29","36","2","2"

A Golden Wake is a historical fiction adventure game set in the Roaring 20's in Miami. Alfie Banks is a realtor from New York that decides to move to Miami to take part in the land boom that caused Miami to become a major city. Along the way he runs into some real people in the area as he tries to gain that Gatsby-esque self made man dream. Though just like Gatsby found out, getting wealth has its price...\n\nOverall A Golden Wake is a quality written game with some real research behind it. The atmosphere is great and the soundtrack is comprised of old timey jazz tunes that really add to the game. The puzzles are also pretty good. They're not difficult but they mostly gel with with what's going on, which I always think is more important in an adventure game. I definitely recommend the game to adventure game fans.","October 10, 2014","true","4.7"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

How come I've never told you that after the excellent Ben Jordan series, Grundislav came back with another universe?\n\nA Golden Wake puts you in the shoes of a young man, trying his luck during the '20 in Florida, in the real estate market, under Georges Merrick and during his apogee before falling into another universe.\n\nIt's a point-&-click adventure, reminiscent of the age of pixelated games, with AGS engine. But here, you have some twists: if you want to be the perfect guy (in other words, unlock achievements), you have to convince people to listen to you and to comply to your requests. If not, well, it's up to you to find another way around. Some puzzles are also included. As far as I know, I enjoyed the plot.\n\nSurrounded by characters that really existed, if you activate comments, you'll have some pieces of history, making it also a learning game for everyone interested in that matter. Yeah, it's in English but who cares? You can have subtitles, no voice acting, etc.. And the voice acting is very good anyway.\n\nThe soundtrack is really fitting the '20. Dam dam dam dam dam damdam.... ups, sorry, I was singing some charleston.\n\nI can only recommend it. Not because I love Grundislav's style since Ben Jordan (ah Ben, Simon, Alice, Percival....) - they're free, people, the original games or the deluxe edition for the two first adventures. But because it's a very enjoyable game. Very very enjoyable game.\n\nDo yourself a favor. Buy A Golden Wake, buy the Blackwell series, download the Ben Jordan series and the Chzo Mythose quadrilogy. You'll understand why they are considered as gems.","October 20, 2015","true","15.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

One of my favourite puzzles was an action minigame where you have to help a wing walker get onto a flying biplane using your car. Another involved uncovering a secret passage and a third was a whole mission in the swamp. At one point early in the game you're given a choice between a sales pitch dialogue puzzle and a minigame where you have to find the right future home for five prospective homeowners based on their preferences and the house descriptions. If you fail the puzzle you get to redeem yourself by solving a traditional item puzzle. The sales pitch is used a couple of times later in the game as well and is always accompanied by an optional personality analysis to make solving it easier. It's a bit of a shame that there isn't more complexity in most of the classic puzzles though, as I would have enjoyed some more roadblocks on my way through the story.\n\nWhere the game really shines is in its story and atmosphere. It explores a time and setting I don't think I've seen in a game of its kind. The carefully created backgrounds, the jazzy soundtrack and the writing together does a bang-up job of creating a feeling of nostalgia for a place in history long gone. And it does so through an engaging story that had me hooked throughout. There are also a lot of background objects to interact with, which even though they don't serve any purpose in solving puzzles really add to the atmosphere of the game. The low-res pixel art is also consistently good, though with a few exceptions. Most notably the glasses of Doc Dammers' character sprite stood out as a bit jarring to me.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed A Golden Wake. And even though I felt the traditional puzzles could have done with some more complexity, the unique additional puzzles made up for it and I really enjoyed the story.","October 10, 2014","true","0.4"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

It's a whirlwind tour of Miami from the early 20s to late 30s and full of real-life historic figures from the era, which is pretty cool.\n\nBut adventure games live and die on the strength of their puzzles and protagonists. And A Golden Wake's puzzles are a binary between incredibly easy and ridiculously opaque, with many of the Persuasion mini-games effectively demanding repeated trial-and-error. And protagonist Alfie Banks feels like someone out of the Deponia series -- terribly selfish and mean-spirited without any real humanity that makes us want to forgive his flaws. He's out of place in the optimistic wonderland of the 20s or the stoic austerity of the 30s.\n\nI hope the writer keeps improving his craft, but in the meantime, pick up Wadjet Eye titles Resonance, Primordia, or the Blackwell series instead.","February 24, 2015","false","6.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

For example, we learn during one scene that Alfie has to drive a car for a wingwalker's stunt because her partner has come down with a cold. However, the same sick partner is then in the next scene, in the car, with no apparent signs of illness. Another minor annoyance is characters who do not know Alfie, addressing him as Mr. Banks (or Alfie) as if they are already familiar with who he was (like the train conductor in the last scene).\n* Puzzles are easy, and exploration is often stunted with dialoge boxes condemning you from doing certain things off the cuff or going certain places.

I adore WadjetEye games and I love most of their titles. The ones I don't love, I appreciate. I appreciate A Golden Wake. It would not be fair to compare this game to other WE titles. Taken on its own merits, the game is pretty interesting. This is a very light P&C. For a noobie, the puzzles are very easy. For a veteran, they are insultingly easy. You are given only so many locations to visit, but their design is very well done. You can only talk to the characters that will continue the story, making all the other NPC's just decorations. OK, I need to get the positives out of the way. If you are interested in the 1920's, then this game is worth playing. The soundtrack is also very fitting for the game. You are surrounded by popular figures of the 1920's. Like I said, the game looks great. What is new with this is that there are more mini-games than puzzles. You have different dialogue trees, so you can be ruthless or the good guy. Where the game falls flat is that it is over so quickly. I felt the story dragged a little bit. It may seem contradictory to say but it took a long time for the story to get going and once it started to get going, it was soon over. That was my biggest gripe. This was done in a historical context, so the makers had limits as to what they could do. Another strike in my book were the sexual overtones in a couple of places. A villain has a realistic portrait of a nude woman in his office. The protagonist is shown getting out of bed naked with a naked woman lying on the bed. While you only see backsides, I felt this was done in poor taste. Overall, I am glad that I played it. It is definitely a departure from WadjetEye's other works and thats not necessarily a bad thing. The game looks good, sounds good, has some interesting new ideas for a point&click, but was too short for my taste. As I write this review, it occurs to me that I need to recommend it.

A Golden Wake is a game that straddles the fine line between "thumbs up" and "thumbs down" and there are just enough negatives to push it in that direction. That's not to say that it's a bad game. Far from it. However, I can't justify a positive recommendation due to a number of factors.\n\nFirst off, the positives. The graphics are as good as they come for an AGS game and the music and voice acting is top notch, as expected for a Wadjet Eye published game. Unfortunately, visuals and audio alone don't make a great adventure game. The biggest disappointment is in the puzzle category. While I don't mind a few easy ones, almost all of them are way too simple. The fact of the matter is, if you get it wrong you can just reload to just before the discussion and eliminate what went wrong. The writing is also rather flat. I went in hoping for a much more engaging story than I got. It only got good during the final quarter or so of the game, which by then wasn't worth having to go through each job you're given. And while the voice actors did a great job in their respective roles, the actual dialogue left something to be desired. Some, particularly George Merrick, had almost no personality at all.\n\nIn short, A Golden Wake is still a decent game and I would recommend it. Just not for the price they're asking. If you can get it during a sale, you should consider picking it up, though.","October 21, 2014","false","5.9"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

I'm a huge fan of point-and-click adventure games and have played them since Sierra started publishing their anthologies. Wadjet Eye has had a lot of successes for me, and while this one is ultimately a success, it falls much flatter than their previous entries.\n\nPROS:\nGreat soundtrack. If 1920s jazz music doesn't do it for you, you should probably pass this one by.\nThe historical background surrounding this fictional work. Again, the early 1920s shines, even though the graphics don't show much for it. I really appreciated how the end credits tied the game and the historical facts together.\nCONS:\nVoice acting. Flat, flat, flat. This has to be one of the biggest flaws for me. If you are going to have all spoken conversations, the acting has to come through. Unfortunately, the only voice actor who seemed to care was the main character, Alfie Banks.\nLength. Yes, the story is fun. Yes, the soundtrack is great. But I want more than 4 hours worth of gameplay. No, Wadjet Eye is not known for their lengthy games, but for my money, I'd appreciate at least 8 hours.\nLinearity. This game is a one way street. There are no alternate choices for you to make. Go here, do this because it's the only thing you can do, rinse, repeat. A Golden Wake felt more like I was just watching events take place, rather than being the cause of said events, in the same vein these new "documentary-style" games.\nEasy puzzles. I don't think "puzzle" is the correct term for what is included in this game.\nThe ending. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn't that. It kind of just came crashing down very suddenly. No pun intended.\nCons may win in a 5-2 battle over pros, but I'd still recommend picking this one up, especially if you are a fan of bygone eras, flappers, rum running, speakeasies, and sweet jazz.","February 17, 2015","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

Many of the locations had lengthy entrance / exit animations that got a little frustrating after a lot of back and forth.  It isn't perfect but certainly is enjoyable, shining in the art, story, and most of the puzzles.\n\nFellow Wadjet Eye fans will recognize voices (I always like picking out Dave Gilbert), and the developer commentary mode once again made me feel like I know the New York indie adventure gaming community.  I recommend A Golden Wake to anyone who enjoys a good game.

I had expected more of a noir-ish detective adventure, since that is such a common theme in modern graphic adventures, but instead you get to spend a few years as a somewhat douchey real estate agent who finds himself thrust into what turns out to be an fascinating slice of real-life American history. Being a modern adventure, the puzzles aren't obtuse and are essentially just a way to break up the story a bit, but because the story and dialog are so well-done, it doesn't matter. I think this is the first game i have ever played where i paused to go read Wikipedia in the middle because i wanted to find out how much of it was real.

Good pick for any fan of the genre– but not at full price.\n\nLong version:A Golden Wake is the first commercial game of Grundislav Games, creator of the award-winning freeware Ben Jordan series. Unlike those games though, Golden Wake uses a realistic setting, the 1920s Miami land boom.\n\nThe story is a typical rise & fall tale about a real estate agent, who, after feeling being cheated out of his hard-earned rewards, ends up as an enforcer for the mob. It is written in episodes, which in turn use a set of key scenes, but the transitions that are supposed hold them together are not too fleshed out.\nThe lack of proper plot consistency is evened out with historical details and quality voice acting (except for one main character, whose lines were recorded in two hours, and it shows).\n\nThe decline of the protagonists is reflected in the puzzles: the first parts of the game feature a good amount of them with large variety, but as the story goes, eventually everything turns into typical (unrealistic) adventure game scenarios.\nThe overall difficulty is mild at best, almost on-rails at worst. The good news is that a good number of puzzles can be skipped or solved in more than one ways, giving the players the freedom of choice, and some uniqueness to the game design.","April 12, 2015","true","7.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The only way I got it that high was because I accidentally shelled out during the credits and forgot about it for 6 hours. In reality, it only took me 3.6 hours to get through. Spoiler warning, by the way.\n\nIf you yearn for the Dagger of Amon Ra era of adventure games, this is a very solid presentation of that ouvre. The graphics are good, the animation is good, the voice acting is solid... it's just the subject matter. It's a really curious choice for a game. It's in the curious position of being very well down without actually being good.\n\nI'm sure both members of the Coral Gables Historical Society will find it fascinating, but other people might find it a little hard to get too invested in the tale of the town's founding, boom and bust. Outside of the sporadic namedrop of local-interest historical figures, there really isn't much of a narrative. The main character turns to crime partway through. I thought, "Finally! Something happened!" but nope! It was not to be! Just when the mob story started to be interesting it gets bored and leaves. Then about 20 minutes later the game is over. It's shockingly brief for the asking price and the puzzles are all dead easy since the game is so short, simple and limited you never have more than a tiny handful of places to go, people to talk to or inventory items to try.\n\nI hate to rag on the work of a small group of enthusiasts like this, and I wasn't going to write a review until I saw the $15 asking price (I myself got the game with the humble adventure bundle.) I guess if you simply MUST have an old-school Sierra-style point and click adventure and you've already played the far-superior and FREE Herald of Raganarok and Vohaul Strikes Back and you think $15 is a fair price for 3.5 hours of moderate entertainment then by all means buy this game.","March 8, 2015","false","9.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Some players may consider this to be one of the weaker titles on the publishers books but this still manages to capture the brilliance of the genre as seen in games like Gemini Rue, Resonance and Technobabylon.\n\nThe game is primarily set in 1920's and you play the role of a young and enthusiastic real estate salesman; Alfie Banks as you follow his fascinating journey of highs and lows of the property boom in the growing new city of Miami in Florida. The format of A Golden Wake is that of other Wadjet Eye titles - a charming point and click adventure with puzzles, various locations, a selection of intriguing characters and an appropriately atmospheric soundtrack. Fans of the genre or other titles from this publisher will be familiar with the trademark hallmarks.\n\nThe only real disappointment of this game is the lack of depth and difficulty. The puzzles are rather simple and although this enables the story to flow and keep the player engaged; some users may feel a distinct lack of a challenge. Progressing between each location becomes quick and simple meaning you can reach the finale fairly rapidly without much thought. Nevertheless; the story and characters continually excel throughout.\n\nOverall; A Golden Wake is another must-buy for fans of point and click adventures or Wadjet Eye. The game may lack when compared to other similar titles but it still delivers a fantastic experience from start to finish. With a few challenging achievements and detailed developer commentary; it offers substantial replayability also.","December 17, 2015","true","6.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

Sure the adventure game mechanics are familiar and the art style is straight out of the LucasArt playbook but none have tried to create an experience like that found in A Golden Wake. Whilst it’s far from a perfect execution, including a story that goes no where for half the play time and a client that still harbors a few bugs, I do admire the ambition behind it. Still it’s hard for me to recommend it for anyone but die hard fans of the genre as they’re probably the only ones who’ll appreciate the craftsmanship and ambition behind A Golden Wake.\n\nRead my full review here: http://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2014/10/17/a-golden-wake-oh-alife-what-have-you-done/","October 16, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Like other Wadjet Eye games, A Golden Wake focuses on story, puzzles, pointing and clicking in the style of Monkey Island, and retro style pixel art.\n\nYou play as Alfie Banks during the Florida Land Boom of the 1920s. You are a talented real estate agent looking to reach the top while dealing with bootleggers, politicians and shady salesmen. I really enjoyed the story and would not hesitate to say it's the most impressive aspect of the game. It was refreshing to play this type of story and it's the kind of plot that demonstrates the appeal of adventure games.\n\nUnfortunately the game just isn't difficult enough. There is a bit of backtracking and most puzzles are quite obvious. A more seasoned adventure fan will blast through this game in about 4 hours. However, I didn't even mind. I enjoyed the dialoue, the plot and the use of mini persuasion style games. I was interested, and despite only having to think about 1 puzzle in particular, I wanted to play until the end with no hesitation.\n\nA Golden Wake is not very challenging, but offers a good story and is set in an interesting period in history. Any modern point and click game is a blessing and I have no problem recommending this game to veterans of the genre. Do not expect any puzzles to make you pull your hair out, but expect a fresh scenario and setting with a few hours well spent afterwards.  Not as great as Primordia or Resonance, but well worth your time.","December 31, 2014","true","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a well put together game, competent story with a completely different setting than we've seen before in an adventure game, good voice acting, and it looks good considering the insane resolution it runs at (much lower than other Wadjet Eye games for some reason).  It's sort of boring for the first half of it, though.  You are doing errands for your boss, and that's just not too interesting.  There aren't many regular inventory type puzzles, so at times it plays more as a visual novel almost.  The main thing I didn't like was that it has a very similar converation mini game as L.A. Noire, and it's just as broken and frustrating here as it was there.  You try to convince people by picking three straight appropriate tones.  In some of them, there's a clue that can help you pick out the right starting choice, but it's basically a guessing game.","February 8, 2015","true","6.8"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","5","13","0","0"

The interface is too simple.  Wadjet Eye is still using the same game engine even though it is known not to be compatible with the Steam overlay.\n\nSummary: Wadjet Eye usually puts out good games, just look at the Blackwell series.  Unfortunately, A Golden Wake just isn't that great.  The game is certainly unique, I mean who has ever studied the history of Miami, Florida during the 1920s?  Unfortunately, the era and location just isn't enough.  The story is completely linear and the player just clicks along while the main character self-destructs.

If you love 'edutainment' genre, you would be delighted to meet many historical persons and listen to the author's elaborate commentaries. If not - just enjoy the time travel.\n\n- The ending. Why, the plot has many surprises for you! And I would not spoil them here.\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n- The game is very linear. You may have a choice as for which one of 'The Three Tasks'(TM) you do first, but almost none of your actions have any impact on the course of the events (besides a couple of extra achievements).\n\n- It is definitely the most easy game published by WadjetEye. You never have to wonder what to do next, and different puzzles you meet are very simple ones. Not that it is a huge disadvantage or something, but it is rather strange to see that after 'Resonance' or 'Primordia'.","October 9, 2014","true","4.5"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","30","35","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/recommended/307570/","drmircow","Dr. Mircow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/","677 products in account","A Golden Wake is an old-school point-and-click adventure game developed by a small group of individuals and published by the renowned Wadjet Eye Games; famous for similar types of games developed in the AGS engine such as the Blackwell franchise.\n\nFirstly, A Golden Wake is set in a rather unique setting which is hardly ever used in video games; and that is in the state of Florida, all the way back in the 1920s. The choice of setting is due to the story revolving around at the height of the period’s Land Boom.  In fact, the story is based on real-life events with a few deliberate artistic emancipations here and there. Right from the start, this aspect of the game already makes it quite appealing as its setting is very refreshing.\n\nYou take the role of Alfred Banks (also simply called Alfie), a young real-estate agent trying to follow in his father’s footsteps and make his name big in this market. Initially working in New York, he eventually relocates in Miami the moment he hears the news about this real-estate boom taking place there and so begins taking part in the new Coral Gables project. Throughout the story split into chapters, you see Alfie’s life turning into a rollercoaster as he discovers both the ups and down of the market (subsequently his job) and how badly corruption can affect even your closest friends and family members. Although the game is very short in length, some of the narrative manages to make the player feel some sort of sympathy for Alfie by the end of it all in a very condensed time.\n\nAs far as old-school adventure games are concerned, A Golden Wake is graphically adequate and as expected from a game developed using the AGS engine, even though some of the drawn backgrounds can lack finer details. But they can be very colourful and the game does a good job in capturing the time period quite nicely. The soundtrack, much like the game’s aesthetics, is another aspect which the game does superbly well in emulating that authentic jazzy feeling of the ‘20s.\n\nAnd that is as much praise the game can receive up to this point as the rest of it is sadly riddled with many flaws ranging from lacklustre design choices to uninteresting writing. While the premise of the story is in actual fact interesting, the narrative eventually becomes, for a lack of a better word, dull -- even justifiably sloppy. This is partly due to the lack of engaging dialogues and fleshed out support characters as Alfie is the only character you would ever care about or feel attached to throughout the game’s story. But even then, through all the troubles he has to face, some of the actions written for him by the developers can seem occasionally implausible or inconsistent. In fact, Alfie is without a shadow of a doubt the best character and in turn the best part of the plot, although that is not saying much in a relatively depthless storyline. From start to finish, you will be able to see how certain events change his life forever, even if you sort of end up "watching" these said events rather than directly causing them in the process. And that latter part is another problem tied to the writing quality in general. It just is not on par with other adventure games and simply puts forward nothing new in a way to at least make itself stand out to some degree.\n\nBut perhaps the most obvious flaw in the game is the design of the “puzzles”. Their solutions are very obvious, arbitrary and even somewhat insulting to seasoned fans of the genre. It can be argued that these so called “puzzles” should not even be called puzzles. Then what is the point of playing a point-and-click adventure game when neither the game’s plot nor narrative is its strongest aspect to at least compensate for this puzzle design? Not only that, but a few fairly inventive puzzle mechanics such as when you attempt to make a sales pitch to a crowd are either used only once throughout the entire game or were implemented in a uninspiring way.\n\nAnd that leads to the next flaw: linearity. Indeed, it is true that the point-and-click genre is infamous for being linear thanks to being a more of story-driven medium, but that does not mean that some form of variety, or choices, should not be included. While the game does manage to offer some moments where you seem to be able to approach things in different orders, even as an illusion, these are very few in between. Going to A, B, C and then D is sufficient in completing a chapter in the game’s story. It basically works just like that. The problem here is clearly that it feels too blatantly linear than it should be.\n\nThen the voice acting can also be hit-and-miss in places, although full credit has to be given to Alfie’s voice actor who singlehandedly put on a stellar performance; he simply overshadowed everyone else.\n\nIn conclusion, A Golden Wake is a very casual adventure game. It ends up offering an interesting premise with a great soundtrack and nice looking old-school aesthetics, but with lots of potential wasted due to mindboggling easy “puzzles” (or simply lack of actual puzzles), a strict linearity and a story which starts slowly, gets bland halfway through and ends too soon. Not much backbone in there really. At the end of the day, it is a by-the-numbers adventure game with nothing ambitious about it. At its current price, it misses a recommendation. Even on a Steam sale I would be cautious recommending this unless you like supporting the indie scene. It is easily the weakest game published by Wadjet Eye which produced far superior and more striving adventure games than this game could ever offer. If there is one word to summarise the game as a whole that would be “mundane”, almost to a point where I would fall asleep on my chair.","December 22, 2015","false","4.8"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","29","36","2","2"

A Golden Wake is a historical fiction adventure game set in the Roaring 20's in Miami. Alfie Banks is a realtor from New York that decides to move to Miami to take part in the land boom that caused Miami to become a major city. Along the way he runs into some real people in the area as he tries to gain that Gatsby-esque self made man dream. Though just like Gatsby found out, getting wealth has its price...\n\nOverall A Golden Wake is a quality written game with some real research behind it. The atmosphere is great and the soundtrack is comprised of old timey jazz tunes that really add to the game. The puzzles are also pretty good.

But here, you have some twists: if you want to be the perfect guy (in other words, unlock achievements), you have to convince people to listen to you and to comply to your requests. If not, well, it's up to you to find another way around. Some puzzles are also included. As far as I know, I enjoyed the plot.\n\nSurrounded by characters that really existed, if you activate comments, you'll have some pieces of history, making it also a learning game for everyone interested in that matter. Yeah, it's in English but who cares? You can have subtitles, no voice acting, etc.. And the voice acting is very good anyway.\n\nThe soundtrack is really fitting the '20. Dam dam dam dam dam damdam.... ups, sorry, I was singing some charleston.\n\nI can only recommend it.

One of my favourite puzzles was an action minigame where you have to help a wing walker get onto a flying biplane using your car. Another involved uncovering a secret passage and a third was a whole mission in the swamp. At one point early in the game you're given a choice between a sales pitch dialogue puzzle and a minigame where you have to find the right future home for five prospective homeowners based on their preferences and the house descriptions. If you fail the puzzle you get to redeem yourself by solving a traditional item puzzle. The sales pitch is used a couple of times later in the game as well and is always accompanied by an optional personality analysis to make solving it easier. It's a bit of a shame that there isn't more complexity in most of the classic puzzles though, as I would have enjoyed some more roadblocks on my way through the story.\n\nWhere the game really shines is in its story and atmosphere. It explores a time and setting I don't think I've seen in a game of its kind. The carefully created backgrounds, the jazzy soundtrack and the writing together does a bang-up job of creating a feeling of nostalgia for a place in history long gone. And it does so through an engaging story that had me hooked throughout. There are also a lot of background objects to interact with, which even though they don't serve any purpose in solving puzzles really add to the atmosphere of the game. The low-res pixel art is also consistently good, though with a few exceptions. Most notably the glasses of Doc Dammers' character sprite stood out as a bit jarring to me.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed A Golden Wake. And even though I felt the traditional puzzles could have done with some more complexity, the unique additional puzzles made up for it and I really enjoyed the story.","October 10, 2014","true","0.4"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

Also, the depressing plot ...  think I can see what they were trying to do with it, I just feel that a game should reward you, now and then.\nGraphics and sound are about up to the usual Wadjet Eye standards, but the puzzles felt too easy for the most part. This game's gimmick, Persuasion / Seller Intution was a great idea but fell flat on its face.\n\nIf you've played every other Wadjet Eye game, The Samaritan Paradox and you still want more, this is for you.","October 21, 2014","false","6.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

It tells a great story of the foundation of Coral Gables, Florida without being too heavy-handed.\n\nPros:\n\n* Story is very rich with accurate history and solid characters\n* The lead protagonist, Alfie Banks, is a great, straight guy much like George Stobbart from Broken Sword\n* Dialogue is historically sound; much research and care was put into this game\n* The persuastion mini-game is a nice change of pace for the genre.\n* Some character's voice-acting is top-notch (George Merrick's was my favorite)\n\nCons:\n\n* There are some holes here and there. For example, we learn during one scene that Alfie has to drive a car for a wingwalker's stunt because her partner has come down with a cold. However, the same sick partner is then in the next scene, in the car, with no apparent signs of illness. Another minor annoyance is characters who do not know Alfie, addressing him as Mr. Banks (or Alfie) as if they are already familiar with who he was (like the train conductor in the last scene).\n* Puzzles are easy, and exploration is often stunted with dialoge boxes condemning you from doing certain things off the cuff or going certain places. This is a good adventure game for beginners to the genre.\n\nOverall: 7/10","February 14, 2015","true","6.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

Unless the topic of the 1920s Florida land boom heavily interests you, stay far far away from this one. Nearly an hour into this game, I found myself bored to tears by:\n1) the extremely dry way the topic was presented;\n2) nothing exciting happening;\n3) the lack of drama/mystery;\n4) the complete lack of connection to the game's lead and any of its other characters.\nI don't usually last this long in such a monotonous game (I view my time as being very precious and if a game doesn't manage to hook me within the first 15 minutes of play, into the trash it goes); the reason I did so here was because I've liked many Wadjet Eye games so far, and hoped this one would be similar in style, pacing and drama. Well, it wasn't.\n\nThe low-res graphics suck.I'm playing on a 1920 x 1080 screen and they look extremely murky and overly stretched out. People and other small objects look like blobs of paint.\n\nPlays more like a visual novel.It may seem like a "game", but for much of what happens (up till the point I stopped playing), I found myself merely executing commands the game wanted me to. For instance, at the start of the game, you must go in and talk to your boss, then check the leads chart, then sit at your table, then wait for your coworkers to cheat you out of your job... YEAH. Cheat you out of your job?! you say? Yes. And you can see the trick they're pulling on you coming from a mile away, yet you still have to follow through with it and be cheated, just because the game doesn't give you any other option. So basically, your character is just like a puppet following "orders" from the game.\n\nNo real choice.See above point.\n\nSo this game is not recommend by any measure. I couldn't find even a single good thing to say about it. Wouldn't touch it even if it were free.","May 6","false","0.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

I really wanted to like this, because I've loved every other game from Wadjet Eye so far, but I really had a tough time getting into this one.  I did finish it, more due to the completionist in me, but also in hopes that it would get better.  Parts of it near the end did improve a little, but overall, the game felt very disjointed, and involved a LOT of "To do this, first you have to get this person to do that, but to do THAT, you have to get these three items", rinse and repeat.  A lot of seemingly-arbitrary tasks ahead of you, and not much in the way of an overarching storyline to tie it all together, other than Alfie (the main character) "trying to make it big" and restore his family's name.  That's about it as far as plot.\n\nI looked up reviews to see if I was missing something, and a lot of reviewers said how they really identified with the main character, Alfie Banks, but I honestly felt he was pretty bland... a fairly generic stereotype of a 1920's real estate agent.\n\nThe one thing I did like about the game is that it's based on the real "history" (with some artistic liberties taken, of course) of Coral Gables, FL.  Many of the main characters have real life counterparts, with the exception of Alfie.  But other than that, with a plot that couldn't figure out which way it was going and never really tied together, subpar voice acting, a step back in the way of retro-styled graphics that didn't just feel "retro-styled" but more like it actually was made years ago (and not in a good way)... I just wasn't a big fan of the game.  Not awful, but not that good.  A big disappointment compared to Wadjet Eye's other fantastic productions.","January 27, 2015","false","5.4"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

I adore WadjetEye games and I love most of their titles. The ones I don't love, I appreciate. I appreciate A Golden Wake. It would not be fair to compare this game to other WE titles. Taken on its own merits, the game is pretty interesting. This is a very light P&C. For a noobie, the puzzles are very easy. For a veteran, they are insultingly easy. You are given only so many locations to visit, but their design is very well done. You can only talk to the characters that will continue the story, making all the other NPC's just decorations. OK, I need to get the positives out of the way. If you are interested in the 1920's, then this game is worth playing. The soundtrack is also very fitting for the game. You are surrounded by popular figures of the 1920's. Like I said, the game looks great. What is new with this is that there are more mini-games than puzzles. You have different dialogue trees, so you can be ruthless or the good guy. Where the game falls flat is that it is over so quickly. I felt the story dragged a little bit. It may seem contradictory to say but it took a long time for the story to get going and once it started to get going, it was soon over. That was my biggest gripe. This was done in a historical context, so the makers had limits as to what they could do. Another strike in my book were the sexual overtones in a couple of places. A villain has a realistic portrait of a nude woman in his office. The protagonist is shown getting out of bed naked with a naked woman lying on the bed. While you only see backsides, I felt this was done in poor taste. Overall, I am glad that I played it. It is definitely a departure from WadjetEye's other works and thats not necessarily a bad thing. The game looks good, sounds good, has some interesting new ideas for a point&click, but was too short for my taste. As I write this review, it occurs to me that I need to recommend it. This game took risks for a P&C. Besides, who makes games about the 1920's?","February 3, 2015","true","10.5"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","4"

A Golden Wake is a game that straddles the fine line between "thumbs up" and "thumbs down" and there are just enough negatives to push it in that direction. That's not to say that it's a bad game. Far from it. However, I can't justify a positive recommendation due to a number of factors.\n\nFirst off, the positives. The graphics are as good as they come for an AGS game and the music and voice acting is top notch, as expected for a Wadjet Eye published game. Unfortunately, visuals and audio alone don't make a great adventure game. The biggest disappointment is in the puzzle category. While I don't mind a few easy ones, almost all of them are way too simple. The fact of the matter is, if you get it wrong you can just reload to just before the discussion and eliminate what went wrong. The writing is also rather flat. I went in hoping for a much more engaging story than I got. It only got good during the final quarter or so of the game, which by then wasn't worth having to go through each job you're given. And while the voice actors did a great job in their respective roles, the actual dialogue left something to be desired. Some, particularly George Merrick, had almost no personality at all.\n\nIn short, A Golden Wake is still a decent game and I would recommend it. Just not for the price they're asking.

The problem is that while these quests are also prevalent in other adventure games, the ones in A Golden Wake route are like a straight road instead of a twisting but scenic route.  The side effect of this is that I don't learn much about the characters. Puzzles can build up characters because solving puzzles can mean revisiting the same people and learning something new not only about the solving the puzzles but about themselves.\n\nIt was only about 3/4 through the game where it feels like the character development was really kicking in but the game soon ends. Either the game had to be longer with more scenes/areas or the puzzles had to be more sophisticated for more character interaction.

Good pick for any fan of the genre– but not at full price.\n\nLong version:A Golden Wake is the first commercial game of Grundislav Games, creator of the award-winning freeware Ben Jordan series. Unlike those games though, Golden Wake uses a realistic setting, the 1920s Miami land boom.\n\nThe story is a typical rise & fall tale about a real estate agent, who, after feeling being cheated out of his hard-earned rewards, ends up as an enforcer for the mob. It is written in episodes, which in turn use a set of key scenes, but the transitions that are supposed hold them together are not too fleshed out.\nThe lack of proper plot consistency is evened out with historical details and quality voice acting (except for one main character, whose lines were recorded in two hours, and it shows).\n\nThe decline of the protagonists is reflected in the puzzles: the first parts of the game feature a good amount of them with large variety, but as the story goes, eventually everything turns into typical (unrealistic) adventure game scenarios.\nThe overall difficulty is mild at best, almost on-rails at worst. The good news is that a good number of puzzles can be skipped or solved in more than one ways, giving the players the freedom of choice, and some uniqueness to the game design.","April 12, 2015","true","7.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And when the rug is suddenly pulled out from under him, he travels to Florida to try his luck as a real estate agent during the Land Boom. After a few years, he begins to feel as though he's being taken advantage of and makes another major change in his career that forever changes him.\n\nI honestly had no clue that the game would be about a businessman, and while it may not seem like an exciting concept initially it was still an interesting plot, a fun adventure and the character, Alfie Banks, is relatable because he's a young man that never seems to find the niche in life that's just right for him; things always change, and they're not always for the best.\n\nI really enjoyed the game because the characters were so colorful and full of life and it was - surprisingly - nice to see how one man's honest journey take such a drastic turn. You would think the story would entail a man trying to find work to fuel his ego, or is fighting to make ends meet for survival - but I took it as an example of finding ones purpose.","October 14, 2014","true","7.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The only way I got it that high was because I accidentally shelled out during the credits and forgot about it for 6 hours. In reality, it only took me 3.6 hours to get through. Spoiler warning, by the way.\n\nIf you yearn for the Dagger of Amon Ra era of adventure games, this is a very solid presentation of that ouvre. The graphics are good, the animation is good, the voice acting is solid... it's just the subject matter. It's a really curious choice for a game. It's in the curious position of being very well down without actually being good.\n\nI'm sure both members of the Coral Gables Historical Society will find it fascinating, but other people might find it a little hard to get too invested in the tale of the town's founding, boom and bust. Outside of the sporadic namedrop of local-interest historical figures, there really isn't much of a narrative. The main character turns to crime partway through. I thought, "Finally! Something happened!" but nope! It was not to be! Just when the mob story started to be interesting it gets bored and leaves. Then about 20 minutes later the game is over. It's shockingly brief for the asking price and the puzzles are all dead easy since the game is so short, simple and limited you never have more than a tiny handful of places to go, people to talk to or inventory items to try.\n\nI hate to rag on the work of a small group of enthusiasts like this, and I wasn't going to write a review until I saw the $15 asking price (I myself got the game with the humble adventure bundle.) I guess if you simply MUST have an old-school Sierra-style point and click adventure and you've already played the far-superior and FREE Herald of Raganarok and Vohaul Strikes Back and you think $15 is a fair price for 3.5 hours of moderate entertainment then by all means buy this game.","March 8, 2015","false","9.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Some players may consider this to be one of the weaker titles on the publishers books but this still manages to capture the brilliance of the genre as seen in games like Gemini Rue, Resonance and Technobabylon.\n\nThe game is primarily set in 1920's and you play the role of a young and enthusiastic real estate salesman; Alfie Banks as you follow his fascinating journey of highs and lows of the property boom in the growing new city of Miami in Florida. The format of A Golden Wake is that of other Wadjet Eye titles - a charming point and click adventure with puzzles, various locations, a selection of intriguing characters and an appropriately atmospheric soundtrack. Fans of the genre or other titles from this publisher will be familiar with the trademark hallmarks.\n\nThe only real disappointment of this game is the lack of depth and difficulty.

Progressing between each location becomes quick and simple meaning you can reach the finale fairly rapidly without much thought. Nevertheless; the story and characters continually excel throughout.\n\nOverall; A Golden Wake is another must-buy for fans of point and click adventures or Wadjet Eye.

Like other Wadjet Eye games, A Golden Wake focuses on story, puzzles, pointing and clicking in the style of Monkey Island, and retro style pixel art.\n\nYou play as Alfie Banks during the Florida Land Boom of the 1920s. You are a talented real estate agent looking to reach the top while dealing with bootleggers, politicians and shady salesmen. I really enjoyed the story and would not hesitate to say it's the most impressive aspect of the game. It was refreshing to play this type of story and it's the kind of plot that demonstrates the appeal of adventure games.\n\nUnfortunately the game just isn't difficult enough. There is a bit of backtracking and most puzzles are quite obvious. A more seasoned adventure fan will blast through this game in about 4 hours. However, I didn't even mind. I enjoyed the dialoue, the plot and the use of mini persuasion style games. I was interested, and despite only having to think about 1 puzzle in particular, I wanted to play until the end with no hesitation.\n\nA Golden Wake is not very challenging, but offers a good story and is set in an interesting period in history. Any modern point and click game is a blessing and I have no problem recommending this game to veterans of the genre. Do not expect any puzzles to make you pull your hair out, but expect a fresh scenario and setting with a few hours well spent afterwards.  Not as great as Primordia or Resonance, but well worth your time.","December 31, 2014","true","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you are interested in depression-era Miami history, this is the game for you; although I'm pretty sure that's a very niche demographic.

It's a well put together game, competent story with a completely different setting than we've seen before in an adventure game, good voice acting, and it looks good considering the insane resolution it runs at (much lower than other Wadjet Eye games for some reason).  It's sort of boring for the first half of it, though.  You are doing errands for your boss, and that's just not too interesting.  There aren't many regular inventory type puzzles, so at times it plays more as a visual novel almost.  The main thing I didn't like was that it has a very similar converation mini game as L.A. Noire, and it's just as broken and frustrating here as it was there.  You try to convince people by picking three straight appropriate tones.  In some of them, there's a clue that can help you pick out the right starting choice, but it's basically a guessing game.","February 8, 2015","true","6.8"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","5","13","0","0"

The interface is too simple.  Wadjet Eye is still using the same game engine even though it is known not to be compatible with the Steam overlay.\n\nSummary: Wadjet Eye usually puts out good games, just look at the Blackwell series.  Unfortunately, A Golden Wake just isn't that great.  The game is certainly unique, I mean who has ever studied the history of Miami, Florida during the 1920s?  Unfortunately, the era and location just isn't enough.  The story is completely linear and the player just clicks along while the main character self-destructs.  The game only has two interactions: left click and right click, look and use -- so boring.   I'd only recommend this game to point & click adventure superfans who want to play everything.   Everyone else is better off picking another game to play.  Hopefully Wadjet Eye will get back on track with their next release.","October 10, 2014","false","5.5"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","0"

Set in the 1920's and 1930's, I couldn't have found this game more appealing. I got my game through a Humble Bundle for approx. $4. Totally worth it. You meet historical characters, join a mob, and run errands for people who are too lazy to do things for themselves. Oh my gosh, it's a perfect point and click adventure. The music is great, and classy! The graphics aren't everyone's cup of tea, but I personally loved them. I also liked being able to pick and choose my answers when people talk to me. Definitely has replay value! 10/10 would play again! To the people who beat the game in less than 3 hours... 1. REPLAY VALUE! Different achievements to get. Duh. 2. You obviously didn't listen to all the text, you probably skipped through it. 3. There are TONS of puzzles, they just all involve finding and using items. That's the main point of a point and click game like this. Also, people who are rating this game on the commentary, that's just plain stupid.
