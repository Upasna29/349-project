It had some potential, but it fell short due to its absolutely terrible use of peer-to-peer matchmaking.\n\nI live in South Africa, and we don't have the greatest connectivity, but I can play just about any multiplayer game with a latency of around 200. The Showdown Effect is not one of those games. Because of the use of peer-to-peer matchmaking, a player has to connect to one central player's computer and, well, it doesn't quite work. 50% of the time the "host" (central computer that all players in the same game connect to) has an awful connection, 20% of the time the connection just drops due to the host quitting his match, and the rare occasions when it does work, you will probably be in a server with rocket-launching tryhards that spoil all your fun, and diminish your chances of having a good game.\n\nThis takes me directly into my second point; I can hold my own when it comes to shooters, but not when the game I'm playing is horrendously balanced - on both sides of the spectrum! Good luck playing with a rifle, because it does fưck all damage and it has a reload period of about half the length of a match. However, equip a rocket launcher to your character and just about every player who can't dodge to the degree of a ninja will be your cannon-fodder.\n\nIt doesn't stop there, though. One of the easily-unlockable characters has INVISIBILITY. Yep, you read that right. You will not be able to see your enemy for a few moments, and in that time he can swiftly dispatch you to your grave. I guess the dev team for The Showdown Effect weren't too bothered with a very, very important aspect of competition - equality.\n\nThere are a handful of positives to this game though, such as the neat animations and the interesting levels with referenced events going on in the background. The cons heavily outweigh the pros, though - and for that I'd have to not recommend this game.\n\nFor the achievement hunters out there, expect to take around 3-5 hours to get all of them, but be warned that you need the Deluxe Edition content to get 2 of the achievements, as one of the requirements is to play as 2 characters that aren't acquireable in the base game.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think The Showdown Effect is worth your money nor time, and so it is thrown straight into the bargain bin.","November 28, 2013","false","6.2"," 52 of 70 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","52","70","0","0"

It's fast-paced insanity with old references that harken back to aged action movies like Terminator or the old character tropes like: "Cop that eats donuts and fights to avenge his partner" to "Scientist that experimented on himself, and fights to control his augmented body."\n\nAll the characters have a special ability and plenty of personality to make them feel fresh... (However some abilities are rather cheap) and there are plenty of different guns like pistols, snipers, rocket launchers, throwing knives, even swords! Still not enough tools of destruction? Well you can bash someone's head in with a prop you found on the level! See that pickaxe stuck in the wall? TAKE IT AND SLICE SOMEONE IN HALF WITH ONE CLEAN SWING! See that little cross with Jesus on it? PUNISH THE NONBELIEVERS! See that pillow on the couch? KILL THEM WITH THE ♥♥♥♥ING PILLOW\n\nWhat's that? You wanna buy this game? Well then, I just have to say--\n\nPlease don't.\n\nNo, really don't. It's a waste. Look, I know I just went on briefly about how I like the game, hell I've spent quite some time in it, and every 2 days I check the game news to see if they've announced anything because I loved it so much. But it's dead. Like... SUPER dead. Nobody plays this game, and if someone IS playing, they're so good it isn't even funny. It's just sad that they've spend so much time being good at a dead game.\n\nI still think this is the best multiplayer action game ever, but unfortunately it's dead. And Arrowhead pulled their support from the game, so it's gone for good.

Rimmer","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042130595/","373 products in account","This game has a great concept. You play as a cheesy parody of a famed action hero. The game plays as a side-scrolling, 2D platformer. You can customize your character with weapons and clothing. You can also get new characters with experience. The levels are sizable. There aren't very many of them though. (I believe there are only 2 or 3.) However, they are well-designed and look great. They have multi-story buildings with roofs, and sewers below the streets. Your character can run, jump, flip, climb walls, dodge, heal, and all sorts of things. It's like Smash Bros., but with more death.\n\nSo it's fun, the controls are good, and the graphics are nice. There's just one problem: The game is online-only. If you can't find a match, you can't play. Sorry. The only single-player content is a training tutorial. This wouldn't be a problem if the game was popular... but it isn't. You won't find a match often. When you do, it'll be against fanatics of the game.\n\nI think the worst thing is a lack of content in the game. You are forced to grind until you unlock other characters. This takes a long time due to your progress being performance-based, and the difficulty in finding a match. Which would be fine if there was some variety to the game... but there isn't. The amount of content is what you would expect from a $1 - $3 smart phone game.","July 3, 2015","false","2.1"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","20","26","0","0"

A person of unknown identity loses control of his memories and sensual abilities and falls into a deep comatose where the memories of his childhood 90s action movies take on a whole new role. The epileptic imagery in the intro might suggest a series of seizures within the temporal lobes of the brain or even the visual cortex over exiting his visual senses making him “see” a combination of memories and hallucinations instead of detecting what surrounds him like with. It is also possible the disturbed visions and colorful memories are the results of the growth of a highly invasive and malignant tumor in the temporal lobes. The case could be similar to Dr. Oliver Sacks’ case of “the passage to India”, where a young girl could vividly see long lost memories of the India of her past after a malignant tumor had grown inside her brain. However the cause of the brain damage to the temporal lobes causing the memories to reemerge are not important, what is to be noted is that these distorted visions of the past brings a certain comfort to the patient. The minds tend to like to compensate for lacks with other things. So the patient while not remembering the exact names of his childhood heroes, his brain renamed them in a way that would sound soothing to him. The struggle lies between recognizing that the visions are mere hallucinations and to face a cold reality of pain or indulge in the fantasy dream world his mind created for him to make him feel happy, like a child again. The visions intermingled with the dreams of a possible comatose has somewhat of a Jungian feel to it. The many characters and objects of his past somehow symbolize many of the figures in his life that he enjoyed the presence of. The characters ad objects are in some way his Jungian dream archetypes. Hailey is the archetype of the child representing his innocence, Thelma his desire to become a hero and achieve glory like his role models, Lance as the father figure he always wished for, Shur foo as the sage etc. Being among his dream archetypes and experiencing a sense a control and belonging pulls him constantly further into his comatose. Eventually, just like Alexander Luria’s “man with a shattered world” , he couldn’t distinguish memories and hallucination and the dreams would repeat themselves over and over again with the same characters his mind created.\nThe brilliance in this game lies in the fact that it can make us feel the torment of the patient, how such a playful and funny and conforting game could seem more interesting than reality but details such as the Jungian archetypes and the visual and auditif seizures remind us that what can be seen is but a stew illusions. And at that time we can feel the pain the patient feels to be forever stuck in this looping fantasy world and that he will probably never see the “real” world ever again. The pain, the feels.\n\nBravo arrowhead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","October 6, 2014","true","792.2"," 32 of 51 people (63%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","63","32","51","10","1"

The reasoning for this is that as soon as the playerbase falls off, you're left with essentially a useless product, which often has a self cannibalizing effect as people are unwilling to buy your game for fear there will be no one online to play with. The Showdown Effect is one such game, something that may have been fun at one point, but is now more akin to a virtual ghost town.\n\nI spent upwards of an hour waiting in the "Ranked" lobby and never once could find even three other players to start a match with. "Custom" games fare little better, with not even a hundred simultaneous players when I check two different times during the day.\n\nI'm not mad that I have a dud in my library, but I am disappointed that I didn't get a chance to play what appears a fun and somewhat original game. The one custom match I made it into was surprisingly entertaining, with a great sense of movement, and clever use of line-of-sight to determine in what enemies were visible. It wasn't the most balanced multiplayer experience, but I would have definitely liked to play more of it.\n\nBut alas it isn't to be, which leaves me with this review. Unless you have a group of 3-7 friends who you know for a fact will be playing with you, there is no way I can recommend The Showdown Effect. Regardless of its actual quality as a game, one that must be sustained entirely by its community is worthless when said community has all but completely died. Strange as it sounds I hope that Paradox decides to switch this over to F2P as they have with some of their other titles, and in turn that more players will begin populating the servers making it playable once again. Until then, I would feel cheated knowing that others bought this without having said my bit, and I hope you will take a moment to consider this before pulling the trigger.","November 27, 2013","false","1.9"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","1"

The game is one big action movie inspired hack and slash/brawler relying solely on multiplayer, which frankly, is a very tight community (Sometimes making finding games very difficult). Characters have their own abilites and one-liners, like you'd expect. Costumization is varied, but only cosmetically. There are only a few weapon types and the base weapon is basically the only weapon you can have if you don't buy weapon skins (bought with in game money)\n\nAt the end of the day, TSE is a great little timewaster to play with friends and mess around with the stunts and action-coolness-explosions-heavyrock, And it isn't much else.

You can do almost everything!\nWeapon variety: shotguns, pistols,smg,swords,machineguns,rifles,knives,RPGs. Evry weapon feel different, because it is different, The game let's you choose two guns at once, letting you combine different sorts of weapons.\nCharacter variety: the game can offer 10 characters,evryone cliche as hell and with a special ability. Hank Stream,  SWAT agent and a family man throws grenades. Mr. Shur Foo, chinese kung-fu master dragon kicks you in the face and so on.\nMaps: The Maps are beautiful! Really, so much effort was put into those! Also,about maps, there are three types of weapons lying on every map. Light- good for throwing,close range,little dmg and very fast; Medium- like a normal sword, but less damage; Heavy- really slow and huge things which kill with one hit;Blockers- very little damage, but a huge blockbar(when it runs out you get stunned).\n\n\nAs much as i love the game it has some huuuuuge minuses:\nReally bad connection issues: if you don't find a good host you are bound to freeze and lag like a madman.\n\nReally small community, but a very pleasant one: the issue aboves scared off almost everyone, except us, a buncha guys with 400+ hours who constantly play the game.\n\nConclusion:\nSo,6 pluses, 2 minuses,but big ones.

(the rating is serious though)\n\nPros:\nFluid combat mechanics: Your moves strike with the right kind of rythm, and feels good in many ways that cannot be captured in words\n\nUnlockable Cosmetics: Although there are some paid-skins, most of them can be purchased via a reasonable amount of in-game currency.\n\nEasy to find your friends: Because of the low player count, it is rare to have more than 1 or 2 game lobbies open. Don't go thinking this means you will be alone though. If you open up a lobby, after a few minutes, you are bound to find someone to play with.\n\nParticle Physics Interaction: Though it can sometimes get a bit frustrating, it is absolutely gorgeuos. You don't know what it's like until you fire your first machinegun into a room full of walls, barrels, and of course, unsuspecting players.\n\ncons:\nThe game can feel pretty empty: This is really only because of the games realative unpopularity, but it is really it's only major flaw.\n\nThe in-game volume defaults to levels that could cause some peoples eardrums to burst.\n\n\nSummary:\nI think that for it's price tag, it's definitely worth it. This would be even more true if more people played this game. So go, buy the 4-pack and spread this game around.

It's a 2d fighting game almost with a vertical element. Its not easy as to inflict damage you can't just shoot toward the enemies but your curosr has to be directly on them. There is also melee wepons for when you get close. It really works well. The biggest downside for most people is the limited number of people playing at any given time. an example on a saturday night I find a game but there's only 1-3 games. This has limited my play time. Also there is no dlc beyond purchaseable skins for weapons/characters. But the game itself imo is brillant and incredibly fun. I say buy.

Champions from throughout time fight to death for fun, for glory and for awesome REALLY made this game seem like fun.\n\nBut there are so many problems with this game. Dont buy it right away, there is a free demo and hopefully thats all you need to realize why this game was a waste of my money.\nThere are never enough people online, and when you do run into people, they are 4 times your level and show no mercy, you can't even learn the controls from gameplay. There are hidden moves I had to learn off of the F**KING LOADING MENU. thats messed up huh?\n\nThe only time you can kill something and have fun is if your on a map by yourself or if your in the training mode. And a game like this just is a pure disappointment from the people of Magicka.\nYes people of Magicka, this game is a true disappointment.\n\nGetting the deluxe version might have cheered me up since it comes with a copy of Magicka, but sadly I got the regular version.","December 24, 2013","false","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

You can just kill each other, team fight or make the bad vs the good guys. the grafic is good and fits to the style of the whole game. Still this game has some pros and heavy cons. Pros: Funny game in 90s style. just kill people and fight your way though them. Cons: The mecanics are very unbalanced, each character has another skill which is in some ways MORE unfair than the other, sample: one character can simple get hollow and you cant see it, onther can just kick you with one(or two) hits in your death. Also the gun traget system. you must -exactly- target with your mouse your enemey to hit them and that in a very fast played game  which is mostly impossible to do (it gives only 2 guns which are pretty unfair so which dont act in this system). So fans from it can play it but still, the unbalanced gameplay feels you, if you really lose, and you will lose more or often, like an idiot even if its -not- your fould.","October 27, 2013","false","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I saw the trailer for this game before it was released and thought it looked really fun and seeing it scored only a 67 on metacritic puzzled me a bit. The Showdown Effect is not a bad game, but it's metacritic rating is deserved.\n\nOn the up side, The Showdown Effect does deliver the action they advertise in the video so if you watched the trailer and thought it looked fun chances are you will enjoy it somewhat at the very least. The gameplay is only average though and I feel like the developers spend more time and energy on the game's theme.\n\nThere are microtransactions in this game but they appear to be exclusively cosmetic and game changing unlocks cannot be purchased with currency in anyway. I am still a little bit offended that microtransactions were introduced to this retail game.\n\nWhat's lacking in this game is any longevity. My impression is that after you got your chuckles from the theme and played a few rounds you've seen all the game has to offer. There are additional characters to unlock but they are largely all the same with the exception of a single special ability.\n\nIn my two hours of gameplay I did experience a few non-crashing bugs - weapons not reloading when they should and my screen blanking out a few times.\n\nThe Showdown Effect is an exclusely multiplayer game so unless you can find people to play online then this game is effectively useless. There is no bot matches or local multiplayer to speak of. I was able to find matches for about 2 hours but they were pretty slim and my session with this game was ended due to the lack of populated servers.\n\nEven though it's a pretty reasonable game, I can't recommend getting this because as gameplay goes it only average and there's no guarantee this game won't soon be a client with no server to connect to.\n\nScore: 6/10\n\n\n","December 15, 2013","false","2.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

When you can actually play a game with others, it's pretty fun; combat is fast-paced, and it definitely doesn't get stale when you're able to play. Unfortunately, that's where the praise falls short; the game is plagued with connection issues, and there are a handful of bugs that still don't seem to be fixed at this point in time. I've been playing the game itself on and off on a friend's computer (my laptop died a few days after getting the game), and I can say that the game is decent...if you can actually get into a server and not run into any bugs while playing.

It has bee quite some time since I have played so I am not sure how populated it is but as long as there are regular player its still worth a shot. there are a few fun game modes and entertainment to be had in The Showdown Effect!","May 11, 2014","true","7.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The ode to 80's and 90's nostalgia is just the beautiful wrapping the game comes in, and it works. I always thought a good competitive Super Smasher Brothers type game was just what the PC needed and this game delivered.\nI even waited until it had been out for awhile to make sure that there was a good foundation of a community,(yes it's only playable online PVP) so that I wouldn't get stuck with a game I can't play, and from what I've seen they are a great bunch of people to play with. Only downside is that most of them are deadly good at the game by now....lol\nThe only thing I didn't like was the fact that it offered an in game store for items that were available only for cash only when all items should be unlockable through the grind.\nAll round great game if you're looking for that new competitive type experience, definitely worth the price and a must have if it goes anywhere close to 50% off.","June 27, 2013","true","55.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The only part of the games visuals I didn't enjoy was the characters, because they look like plastic. The game is succeeding to give you that 80's action feel, since they have their obligatory Terminator parody. I also need to point out that the menu literally looks like an 80's TV screen.\n\n\nSound: 7/10\nShowdown has an explosive action theme song that really pumps you up for the action, but sadly there is no song like that once you enter a round. The sound effects are fine, but it's mostly guns firing so there isn't much to say about that.\nThe voice-acting is very funny since they do have that bootleg Terminator, which creates some funny moments when playing the game.\n\n\nGameplay: 7/10\nThe gameplay is fun and fast. It's a 8-player deathmatch game that lasts 5 minutes. Once you're done with those 5 minutes it transitions into a last man standing kind of thing (note: the last man standing is not the winner. The winner is the person with the highest amount of kills.) which changes the pacing slightly as you aren't all that willing to die.\n\nThere are some unlockable guns and characters, but you should be able to get everything by a couple of hours of gametime. I would've enjoyed more customization but they probably did this to keep the game balanced. All in all the gameplay is very enjoyable.\n\n\nDLC: 8/10\nThe DLC in Showdown is kinda useless. The reason for this is that they are reskins of weapons, or hats. I enjoy this alot since it keeps the game fair and balanced.\n\n\nMoney/Time: 1/10\nThe game doesn't cost much and I enjoyed it very much, but the game is now dead. There is nobody online nowadays so just stay away from the game. It's a shame that the developers (spearhead studios, creators of Magicka.) updated the game once then left, and are now working on Magicka 2. Get Magicka 2 instead, you'll most likely have a better time there...","May 9, 2015","false","51.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Most things have to be unlocked, which dampen the fun a bit. Also, the controls and movement options are a bit on the heavy side. The biggest problem is that I didn't feel compelled to keep playing. All in all, it's nothing too special.\n\nThink: Team Fortress 2 meets the platform genre, except there are no classes (at first) and no team play. This is a simple death match type of game.\n\nMy advice is to give it a shot during free week-end or if there's a good sale.","September 23, 2013","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For you who doesn't know 2.5D means that you have 3D character models put in a 2D movement plane. TSE is a fun game, it's competitive multiplayer, with few modes, most popular Deathmatch and Expendables. Deathmatch is self-explanatory , Expendables is a match where there're two teams: one is custom made characters who are defending themselves from the other team who are players who spawn with random weapons.\nGameplay is really slick, you run, slide, wall-jump to get to higher places, you shoot from pistols, SMGs, machine guns, RPGs, slicing with swords. When a round is near the end, big "SHOWDOWN" pops up, and sick guitar riff starts playing, background is starting to explode, that means that it's the end of the match and it's time to see who will be the last man standing: everybody gets full health, no respawn, last man standing gets bonus points. You have in-game store in which you spend money for costumes and weapon skins (only cosmetic changes, there are no buffs in this game) or you can go in "Unlockables" tab and spend points you earn in matches for same things. You also have various characters with various abilities, like temporary shield, poison bomb, rocket boost, etc.\nThe game is really fun, it has really well done soundtrack, gameplay is interesting, graphics are really nice, and if you have a chance to buy it, I strongly advise you do.","August 2, 2014","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The movement in this game is great, you feel it control of your character at all times, and can use dives tackles, dodges, jumps, wall jumps, wall hangs, flips and slides to navigate the wonderfully detailed levels. As for the combat, you have seven basic weapon types, all of which behave differently, and you can bring two into a fight, so theres plenty of mix and matching and experimentation to do. Or you can only use your fists if you like. Different characters have different personalities, and also different special abilities like temporary invulnerability or  health on kill, and so far they all seem well balanced.\n\nOf course, the combat goes hand in hand with the movement, and its all about using all these weapons and abilites on the move while dodging enemy fire and by god it all combines into one hell of a game, it feels great to dodge artfully around a room chopping up enemies with a sword, or winning a match by tossing your empty gun at a fleeing opponent or gracefully sliding under an incoming rocket while blasting the shooter with your pistol or dive tackling an enemny off a cliff just as theyre about to land the killing blow.\n\nIts just great fun!

It was great whilst it lasted, and if it gets a steady community again, could be alot of fun again.","June 24, 2014","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First of all, it is SLOW. I mean it really chugs. My computer isn't the best or the newest, but I run things like Call of Duty, Europa Universalis, Civilization V, and Total War: Shogun 2 without much of a problem; so the fact that it takes 20-30 seconds for something like a menu click to register is godawful. Something that should be optimized, isn't.\n\nControls are clunky, overly-complicated, and difficult to learn. Click detection is atrocious. There is no tutorial level, and no instructions of any kind beyond some extremely minimalistic and jumbled illustrations that skim over the basic controls. You have to dive into the deep end and suffer through a confusing die-fest in the hope that you'll magically catch on.\n\nGraphics aren't great. Character models are boxy and there's an unacceptable amount of blur. Projectiles have visible polygons.\n\nOverall, I'm not ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I got it for $1.99. But I'd caution anyone against paying full price for this mess.\n\nI only played one match, yes.

Nothing like the satisfaction of the first time you kill that guy whos killed you 15 times in a row. Even better when you can even the odds.\n\nThe shooting mechanic is a bit difficult, for me at least, I never managed to get it down well. But the melee was really fun, and with the ability to block bullets for a time, you can take on most gun toting players.\n\nFast movement is the key to dodging bullets, but with the games latency correction, if you're playing with people far away from you it's more about who sees who first. I also had some times when I couldn't connect to any servers with a friend, we saw different server lists. Despite it working 5 minutes earlier.\n\nIn additon part of the time you may not be able to connect to a server, sometimes it's a ghost in the list, sometimes it gives you no reason. Also it oes have the problem of a host dissconnecting stopping the whole game. BUT you do get points for you kill up to that point.\n\nDespite some shortcomings, I had alot of fun with this game. Watch some gameplay on Youtube and if it looks like something you might like, give it a try.\n\nWith fun rulesets, over the top sterotypical 80s action characters, cheesey and yet somehow hilarious dialog, and really good melee combat, it's certainly worth a try.\n\nThat said, I bought it on sale, and if I had to do it over again, I'd definitely buy it, when it's on sale. With it's shortcomings, if it's at full price, unless you really think you'll love it, I'd wait till it's on sale or in one of those game bundles[like Humble Bundle] or something.","October 23, 2013","true","36.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Playing a match is like watching the action scene of several movies welded together in a hilarious chaotic mess full of snappy one liners and bullet riddled sets.\n\nEach character has unique abilities, such as, I kid you not, the "out his own time Austrian kindergarden teacher with a stolen identity"  's ability to shield himself from damage, allowing him to stand tall in the face of oncoming gunfire whilst wielding massive machine guns!  and ... well, you get the idea.\n\n\nThough simple, the game manages to incorporate a high skill cap in it's mechanics, guns will only hit the target, rather than the surroundings, when your cursor is over them, allowing for the various rolls, slides, jumps, flips and tackling dives to come into play, there is also a large variety of weapons, including various guns and melee weapons, each with their own strengths.\n\nThe levels are designed in a way reminiscent of a miniaturized metroid mania\nwith large rooms interconnected by passages ranging from corridors to airducts, with various environmental objects strewn about them\n\nThe developers decided to go with a large number skins over the same stats\nallowing for a large amount of personalisation, which also stretches over to player customisation, which extends beyond hats and into chest and leg wear as well, allowing you to add to your character or create something entirely different, like a kung fu master in full plate.\n\nAll in all Showdown Effect is a solid game, combining elements from shooters and beat em ups into a fast paced, unique and entirely amusing experience\nI'd recomend it to anyone who enjoys games like Super Mario Bro's or action flicks of any sort.\n\n-Az","March 8, 2013","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The movement in this game is great, you feel it control of your character at all times, and can use dives tackles, dodges, jumps, wall jumps, wall hangs, flips and slides to navigate the wonderfully detailed levels. As for the combat, you have seven basic weapon types, all of which behave differently, and you can bring two into a fight, so theres plenty of mix and matching and experimentation to do. Or you can only use your fists if you like. Different characters have different personalities, and also different special abilities like temporary invulnerability or  health on kill, and so far they all seem well balanced.\n\nOf course, the combat goes hand in hand with the movement, and its all about using all these weapons and abilites on the move while dodging enemy fire and by god it all combines into one hell of a game, it feels great to dodge artfully around a room chopping up enemies with a sword, or winning a match by tossing your empty gun at a fleeing opponent or gracefully sliding under an incoming rocket while blasting the shooter with your pistol or dive tackling an enemny off a cliff just as theyre about to land the killing blow.\n\nIts just great fun!

The levels are smaller and are more platforming. And gameplay is more focused on melee. Which makes the gameplay more frantic. The controls are smooth, but the gun aiming system makes it keyboard and mouse only. A controller would better match the movement and melee. But the main problem is with smaller multiplayer only games like The Showdown Effect is the low amount of people who play it. Soldat's popularity mainly came from being free and having low requirements. Which was great for playing with your friends and what made it fun. Same with The Showdown Effect you need some friends to enjoy the game with. Playing alone makes it boring after a couple of matches.","January 6, 2014","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First of all, it is SLOW. I mean it really chugs. My computer isn't the best or the newest, but I run things like Call of Duty, Europa Universalis, Civilization V, and Total War: Shogun 2 without much of a problem; so the fact that it takes 20-30 seconds for something like a menu click to register is godawful. Something that should be optimized, isn't.\n\nControls are clunky, overly-complicated, and difficult to learn. Click detection is atrocious. There is no tutorial level, and no instructions of any kind beyond some extremely minimalistic and jumbled illustrations that skim over the basic controls. You have to dive into the deep end and suffer through a confusing die-fest in the hope that you'll magically catch on.\n\nGraphics aren't great. Character models are boxy and there's an unacceptable amount of blur. Projectiles have visible polygons.\n\nOverall, I'm not ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I got it for $1.99.

Killing the One Man Army then changes to another person and this goes on till everyone has had a turn. Its fun. Specially when the henchmen only have rockets and keep killing eachother by accident! Oh and just because its a sidescroller dont think you just point at one direction to kill anyone. You have to put your cursor ON the character you're trying to shoot, which makes this game a more balanced game, imo. You can also add rules such as infinite ammo, low cooldown on character skills, no weapons, people always explode when they die, etc. Unlocking characters and weapons is actually easy and you have so much fun you dont even realize when you have the points to unlock them.\n\nWhile you can play this with random people, you can just play with friends. It is SO FUN with friends!\n\nOh and for you people that like to stream on Twitch, it has like, integrated Twitch streaming. I have no idea how that works since i dont actually do streams myself so.\n\nAnyways id say this game is like a 8.5/10.  If you see this on sale: BUY IT.\nUnless you're willing to pay 10 dollars for this game. Its kinda a short game for 10 dollars so.\n\nHave fun!","September 18, 2013","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Playing a match is like watching the action scene of several movies welded together in a hilarious chaotic mess full of snappy one liners and bullet riddled sets.\n\nEach character has unique abilities, such as, I kid you not, the "out his own time Austrian kindergarden teacher with a stolen identity"  's ability to shield himself from damage, allowing him to stand tall in the face of oncoming gunfire whilst wielding massive machine guns!  and ... well, you get the idea.\n\n\nThough simple, the game manages to incorporate a high skill cap in it's mechanics, guns will only hit the target, rather than the surroundings, when your cursor is over them, allowing for the various rolls, slides, jumps, flips and tackling dives to come into play, there is also a large variety of weapons, including various guns and melee weapons, each with their own strengths.\n\nThe levels are designed in a way reminiscent of a miniaturized metroid mania\nwith large rooms interconnected by passages ranging from corridors to airducts, with various environmental objects strewn about them\n\nThe developers decided to go with a large number skins over the same stats\nallowing for a large amount of personalisation, which also stretches over to player customisation, which extends beyond hats and into chest and leg wear as well, allowing you to add to your character or create something entirely different, like a kung fu master in full plate.\n\nAll in all Showdown Effect is a solid game, combining elements from shooters and beat em ups into a fast paced, unique and entirely amusing experience\nI'd recomend it to anyone who enjoys games like Super Mario Bro's or action flicks of any sort.\n\n-Az","March 8, 2013","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You will have fun playing this online by yourself with strangers (good luck finding a non-private server) but the most fun you will have in this game is playing with your friends. You will often find yourself cursing your friends as they pull off some sort of crazy move, and then laugh at them as they die to a similar fate the next second. This game especially reaches its high during the sudden death final to each round: the Showdown. My only gripes are the lack of community, glitches that can occur while hosting, and the reletivly small character selection. Other than that, its a great game.
