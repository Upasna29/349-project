I played a few 4-people races and it was super fun for a while especially since you can shoot disables at your friends to slow them down, reverse the controls etc. inbetween trying not to get lost in the maze (especially with the longer tracks, just make sure to find the direction of the flag arrow before the race starts) and parkouring the obstacles. The quality of the graphics is awesome but I will warn those with laptops and lower-end PCs that this might lag for you as the game lagged slightly for me with my i7 2.8GHz, GeForce GT 630 and 16GB RAM setup. It made it quite difficult to pass some of the moving obstacles as they switch positions very fast in the race. Overall, its a really cool-looking, fun party game to play with friends.\n\nPanda Dislikes: Unfortunately there isn't any leveling or reward system for playing the game, so I wouldn\'t recommend this for anyone going SOLO right now as the server doesn't seem to be very populated either. It was a little disappointing as I do think this game is cool and all that but I think this is more of a one-off game, definitely not one to play often unless your friends are up for it.\n\nPanda Verdict: 3.5/5 - I love the aesthetics, gameplay and idea but it seems to lack a few things that would make it a popular game to play in the long run.","June 1","true","0.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

But this is addicting.  It\'s a competitive footracing game, with moving obstacles and randomized race tracks.  There is no single player mode, but there\'s also nothing here that would make it necessary.  The visuals are neat, I really like the designs and colors they went for here.  There\'s a view for 1st or 3rd person, also which is nice, you don\'t see options too often.  I prefer 1st person myself.  It\'s fast paced and a bunch of fun.\n\nYou can get in and out of races really quick, so you\'re not stuck wasting time not playing.  You get different powers that you can use to trip up your opponents, which can sometimes change the outcome of the race entirely.  I still suck at MP, but found myself winning a couple rounds here and there, just due to some well timed powers and luck.  You get a freeze power which freezes you in your tracks, another power which reverses your controls, and also one that makes you slide everywhere like there\'s oil slicks on your feet.  You also have a shield that you can use to deflect attacks if you time it right.\n\nAll that with the randomized tracks and moving obstacles make this a fun challenge.  It\'s not contending for any GOTY awards, but it\'s definitely worth the $10 and it\'s a fun distraction that doesn\'t require a lot of commitment.  I\'m looking forward to seeing what else they do with this.  Get a group of your friends together so you can scream obscenities at each other over skype or whatever and it\'s a blast.","June 1","true","0.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I got the chance to play with the devs and some friends in a multiplayer match. And we really had a blast!! I teared up from laughing so hard while playing this game.\n\nThis game has much potential in my opinion. Multiplayer is sooo much fun.\n\nIt's like a parcour game with funny attacking elements: You can either stop another player from being able to move, invert his keyboard and mouse controls to confuse him or "icing" him, so he can't relly run or even stop. In addition everybody is struggling with the obstacles which are pretty annoying - I mean by playing the game, not annoying in general.\n\nIt's just so much fun, playing this game with other players and TOTALLY worth the 10 bucks.\n\nThe idea is great and the devs are going do improve the game and add new features in the future. They already have a lot of ideas and about to integrate them.\n\nOverall a great party game for up to 8 players. Looking forward for new stuff being integrated into this game and many people buying this game so one can easly find opponents to play this it.","June 5","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
