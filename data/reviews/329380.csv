I personally had none; from the moment I clicked “Play” until the moment I finished, I experienced no problems.  As such, I am going to move forward and actually review the game itself.  But be aware, you may have to take some extra steps to get it working (or not).\n\nStealth Inc 2: A Game of Clones was one of the more enjoyable side-scrolling puzzle-platformers I have played in a while.  The developers did an outstanding job of creating challenging, thought-provoking puzzles while expertly avoiding needless frustration.  The average gamer who may be interested in this should have no problem finishing the game with a little patience and diligence.  However, if you are someone who craves masochistic experiences: then you can challenge yourself to attain the “S-Rank” on every level— a feat which will require you to be fast and precise, and should grant you the frustration you desire.  Due to this outstanding game design, Stealth Inc 2: A Game of Clones should appeal to a full audience of people who enjoy the genre.\n\nThere is a large overworld map to traverse as you make your way from one test chamber to the next.  Each test chamber acts as a self-contained level which can be replayed later from the main menu for achievements or time-trials.  As you conquer the test chambers you will unlock new gadgets which will open up new areas on the overworld for you to explore.  There is a plentiful network of collectibles and secret areas to discover, if you are inclined to do so.\n\nThe atmosphere and narrative aspects of the game create an amusing and enjoyable pseudo-Aperture Science identity.  As you attempt to solve puzzles, you will be mocked and taunted by the man pulling the strings.  I found most of it to be quite humorous, and it added an extra level of playfulness which served the overall gameplay experience well.  The only negative aspect is that the lines were not voiced, but rather pop up as text against the backdrop, and sometimes you don’t feel like reading it while you’re trying to pull off a tricky platforming section.\n\nIt should also be noted that this game is the sequel to the earlier edition in the franchise, Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe.  You should feel no obligation to play the first one before playing this.  The narrative aspects of both games are very light and shallow and the general gameplay is nearly identical. However if you want to play with some different gadgets and explore some different levels, then you may want to consider picking it up.\n\nIn short, Stealth Inc 2: A Game of Clones is a well-crafted game that should appeal to most fans of the genre, whether hardcore or casual, long-term or new.  There is a lot to do, and it can easily last longer than 20 hours to surmount everything.  And if you really get into it, there is an option to construct and/or play user-created levels.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","December 17, 2015","true","22.2"," 65 of 68 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","65","68","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dingledots/recommended/329380/","dingledots","Dingledots","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dingledots/","941 products in account","After hearing that there was a sequel coming out for Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe, I was incredibly excited. I thoroughly enjoyed the first game and thought it was wonderful. Alas, this isn't a review for the first game. It's a review for the Stealth Inc 2. I went into Stealth Inc 2 with great expectation because of my experiences from the first game. I'll tell you now that I was not let down at all. Stealth Inc 2 is a wonderful game and a fantastic follow-up to the first.\n\nThe gameplay remains much the same: manipulate various parts of the environment so that you can access terminals which you must hack. Once all terminals are hacked, reach the exit and you're done. In Stealth Inc 2, this formula is still present but also added on to. Instead of just navigating through menus to select the level you want, you must proceed through a metroidvania-esque world, solving puzzles to reach each level. Being a huge fan of metroidvanias, I love this change and thoroughly enjoy it. Scattered around this overworld are various pickups that you can obtain to unlock different hats and suits. These hats and suits are purely aesthetic, and this bit of customization to differentiate yourself from all of the other clones is a nice addition. Another difference between Stealth Inc 2 and the first game is that instead of there being a hard-to-get collectable on each level, there are clones that you must rescue. The locations of these clones range from being incredibly easy to get and almost unmissable to hidden fairly well. Finding these clones is a lot of fun, and escorting them to the exit can be quite the challenge.\n\nAs far as the audio for the game goes, it's done quite well. The music isn't intrusive, and that's a great thing when it comes to puzzle games. Just because the music isn't intrusive doesn't mean it isn't good, though. The music tracks are done quite well (especially the 8th level of each "chapter"). It isn't the sort of music that will ever get stuck in your head, but I didn't find myself wanting to turn off the music, either. It is certainly fitting for the type of game that Stealth Inc 2 is.\n\nGraphically, the game is a huge improvement over the first. Everything looks crisp and clean, and it stands out well. It's a pleasure to look at, and after my 3.5 hour session with the game, my eyes weren't feeling sore or tired. The game does a good job of differentiating between light and dark. Given the importance of these elements in the gameplay, this is a VERY good thing. Dark isn't too dark, and light isn't too light. It's just right and that's a wonderful thing.\n\nWhen it comes to controls, I only have one gripe. Aiming the tool with the right stick (or aiming lasers, by extension) can be very awkward and very frustrating since it isn't precise. One of the levels requires you to walk straight ahead while also aiming a laser in that same direction. Although it wasn't overly difficult, I felt it was harder than it should have been because keep the laser trained in the one spot while also having to walk was very awkward. Other than this gripe (which really isn't that huge of a deal), I found the controls to be nice and smooth. I use a controller while playing, though, so I can't really comment on keyboard/mouse.\n\nOverall, Stealth Inc 2 is a wonderful sequel that surpassed my already high expectations. I look forward to exploring all the nooks and crannies that the game has to offer. If you enjoyed the original, you'll love the sequel. If you enjoy puzzle platformers, I'd recommend this game as well. It's an absolute joy to play.","April 30, 2015","true","7.1"," 53 of 58 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","53","58","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sprsclr/recommended/329380/","sprsclr","sprsclr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sprsclr/","147 products in account","I'll write this review from my point of view as a long time high level player of SB.\n\nGameplay\nThe core changes in Stealth Inc 2 can be summed up as such\nThere's actually a story now which gives the clones some background.\nYou now traverse thru a Metroidvania style overworld in order to find and unlock the levels which are scattered across different areas.\nEach chapter of 10 levels is focused on a particular piece of equipment and the new equipment introduced add a lot of depth to the game.\nUnlike before whereby you unlock extra levels (e.g. 1-9 and 1-10) either by getting S-rank or collecting all the helices on all levels in the chapter, now you have to find these extra levels on the overworld.\nInstead of finding helices in each level, there are now one or more clones on each level which you need to guide to exit safely.\nS-ranking levels is much less of a thing now as the requirements are fairly low and I believe you no longer need to satisfy all 3 requirements in a single run to get S-rank. (e.g. You can do 3 separate runs - 1 with 0 deaths, 1 with 0 spots and 1 with the required time)\nFinally there are collectible costumes hidden thruout the overworld and getting them will require you to solve some puzzles or finding them in some hidden area of the map.\nControls\nThe new equipment requires that you aim manually using your mouse (for mouse and keyboard players). Using teleporters from SBD as the reference point, the new control scheme requires far more dexterity as you need to specifically aim your throw. Unlike the original where you only have 3 static paths to choose from (high, middle, low), you now have the freedom of adjusting your throw arc according to your mouse position. They also introduced throw strength (e.g. single click to drop the equipment next to you, long clicks to do maximum distance throws). The most annoying thing about this is aiming while the camera moves as the throw arc changes with the camera perspective. Note that just as in SBD, the lines indicating the throw path are ultimately just guides, the actual path is actually slightly different.\n\nIn case you're wondering, yes you can remap the key bindings.\n\nGraphics\nIn Stealth Inc 2, the graphics have been overhauled and it's now a 2.5D experience. However, this change is one I actually dislike as I prefer the faster response of SBD. Subjectively, I find that the movement of the player character is somewhat different from SBD. Basically, there's a stronger sense of inertia now which makes it such that changing directions when you're running is slower. When changing directions quickly, you will sometimes notice that you're moving in the opposite direction that you're facing (e.g. moving left but facing right).\n\nThere are NO graphical options apart from Resolution, Anti-Aliasing and Fullscreen/Windowed mode.\n\nAudio\nThe sound isn't exactly catchy but it also isn't something you'll end up turning off. It's very similar to the original games given that it's done by the same person, Ricky Honmong. =)\n\nMiscellaneous\nThere are a few key UI choices in the game which puzzle me. I could be wrong but I quote these examples solely based on my experience. The game has WADS mapped for the directional input but when you're in the menus it only responds to the arrow keys. Also once you have multiple equipment unlocked, you will use the mouse wheel to switch between them. However contrary to normal expectation, selecting the equipment will also trigger it.\nThere's no way to warp between each area on the overworld. This is an oversight to me. It's one thing to explore the overworld but when you know exactly where you want to go and you have to go through 20 odd rooms to get there, it gets old very quickly.\nOne note on support, or lack thereof. There hasn't been a single patch nor has there been any posts from the dev since the release. So check the discussion boards for issues that others have encountered before making the jump.\nConclusion\nStealth Inc 2's new equipment is very well thought out and has a lot of unexplored potential.\nThe story is forgettable and I'm not a fan of the overworld or the collectible costumes that were introduced as they add little to the game.\nIn my opinion the challenge level of Stealth Inc 2 is significantly lower compared to SBD. The leaderboards are also severely lacking any form of competition.\nI'd recommend Stealth Inc 2 to the casual gamer but I suggest those like me which enjoy high level play to consider carefully before making the purchase.\nStealth Inc 2 is by no means a bad game but it's safe to say that it could have been much better.","May 9, 2015","true","36.1"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","34","39","0","4"

For some reason, changing the controls is not an option. Too much time spent stuck in a puzzle I know how to figure out, but can't actually execute\n-While there are a lot of ingenius tricks in a basic 2D layout, the game just goes on for too long to prevent it becoming repetitive and boring\n-The levels are set out in an overall world, and each level has to be found before it can be played - finding the levels and figuring out the puzzles to reach the next stage is often much harder and takes much longer than the actual level itself\n\ntl;dr It does well in much of what it tries, but it is awkwardly controlled, too repetitive, and the difficulty varies quite a lot.","December 21, 2015","false","6.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Playing this game felt like like meeting with an old friend and just having good times. From the moment I started playing I enjoyed what the game was offering visually, gameplay, and story. You play one of many clones in some twisted Mcdonalds version of Apature science. Putting poor adorable clones through brutal tests that usually get them killed. One clone decides to take a stand and just maybe, break free. The game itself is mixture of standard puzzle solving levels and in between, an over-world with metroidvania elements. You can explore, find secrets, and collectibles between levels as your arsenal of gadgets begins to expand. Speaking of gadgets, this constantly keeps the game feeling fresh and adding new elements and ways to overcome challenges. Including the games excellent level design and extremely smooth controls. Stealth Inc 2 is a welcome addition to any puzzle/platformers library. Did I mention the level editor and community content? The gripes with Stealth Inc 2 are minor, things such as not being able to pull blocks, and constant instant death scenarios can grow tiresome but most of the time are your own fault. More options would've been nice but despite this the game does look very smooth. In all, Stealth Inc 2 doesn't reinvent the wheel but it does certainly hit all the right notes. If you are looking for a solid platformer with some good replay, you should check out this title.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/S8z996GphdE\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","October 25, 2015","true","2.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The basic elements of the game like the controls, the visuals and the audio are all well polished and fully functional. The puzzles demand a combination of good reflexes, observational skills and a small amount of strategic thought (good planning will mostly just make your finish time faster). Gadgets that you acquire as you progress through the game switch up the experience at an adequate pace and each level is unique and more-or-less interesting in some way. I liked the Metroid-vania aspect of the game, as being able to mess around with the gadgets in the sandbox-ish enviroment of the overworld and it's multi-gadget puzzles is fun, even if you end up spending a fair amount of time just running around instead of doing the levels, or rather, the "tests" themselves. The techno-industrial style of the game is pretty slick, too, and I really like the soundtrack and aesthetics. My biggest gripes with the game are that:\nThe optional puzzles could've been harder and more intricate.\nAiming your throws when using a gamepad is finnicky and could be made to be much more responsive.\nI found the Adventure Light gadget to be really underwhelming and I was bored by it and most of the missions where it was used. I genuinely think that it's the least enjoyable gadget to use since it's centered around a bad gimmick (areas that are pitch black for no apparent reason and impossible to navigate without light) that inconveniences the player more than it empowers them.Almost everything else about it though, I liked, and I would definitely recommend it (and the original, Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe) to anyone that likes a fairly challenging puzzle platformer that's just a bit more action-oriented than usual.","September 29, 2015","true","14.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The menus work reasonably well with the mouse and are very snappy, but if you use the controller or keyboard controls, especially in the editor, the cursor can go away making clicking things a challenge. The editor is clearly designed for a controller as well. I can see they did their best to make it work with a mouse without altering, but it really needed a redesign if they expect people to be proficient with the tools. Icons are huge, and only show the text saying what they are when selected. Hovering over does nothing, so you have to click and drag to make it show the text without selecting, and it will select whatever you're on upon release. All of these things could have been in drastically smaller hotbars/windows. The default controller mapping is okay, but the placement of crouch and interact aren't very optimal for a speedrun focused game like this. There's no controller rebinding, but to be honest that's rare and thus I and many others choose controllers like the DS4 where you have full control map anything anywhere.\n\nThe game speed is tied directly to the framerate, and their target was 60. I opened the game and instantly spotted and enjoyed the smoothness of the intro logo animation and menu responsiveness, but when I got in game I knew it was at double speed. Extremely responsive absolutely, but it makes the game drastically harder while also punishing even slightly nonoptimal movements by scaling the timer speed the same. If you drop frames, it will slow down. If you cap at 10 FPS, you could essentially play with tons of time to prefect every step and get flawless times to top the leaderboard, that is if people hadn't already hacked to achieve 0.00s. Capping framerate is bad enough, but tying gamespeed to it is often even worse. Please developers, don't do either.\n\nTaller than 16:9 is letterboxed, while it seems that wider resolutions stretch the hud and just show less of the game vertically.\n\nGameplay\n~IN PROGRESS~ Interesting puzzles/scenarios, and a nice hub world vs the menu-only level selection of the first game. Many if not seemingly all of the levels include AI companions that play like a co-op game would (very similar to Portal 2), so it's a shame co-op levels weren't included. It's clear the single player levels weren't made for that as there are sometimes multiple companions, they are only around for portions of the levels, and getting them to the exit is a bonus objective. That said, just more levels, even as an expansion, meant for local co-op would be great.\n\nPresentation\nIt was a Wii U exclusive for 5 months, and it absolutely shows. The assets were designed for 720P, so all the Menus and HUD scale badly and lose their their sharpness with odd pixelation, as opposed to the blurring you get by setting the whole game to 720 and upscaling. Behind the HUD and Menus, the game itself seems to render at the native resolution, though the 3D character models have aliasing even with 4X MSAA set in the launcher (AA being the only graphical setting in the game).\n\nThe music I've heard is very nice, and the overall visual style is there, though the 3D character model's shading contrasts a tad with the levels.\n\nTLDR - Summary\n~IN PROGRESS~ Port issues, but the small scope helps in that respect, and the actual game itself seems engaging and charming, though frustration is sure to kick in if it's anything like the first in the series. Exclusivity for consoles hurts games as evidenced with this games needless 720P target res, and the fact that we still don't have the Ultimate version of the original game in this new engine/style, because it's exclusive to Sony platforms...","September 2, 2015","true","4.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I played the hell out of the original free version, made a dozen levels, played the hell out of the deluxe version, made more levels. The anticipation for this one was big.\n\nSo, how does it hold up comparing to its predecessors? Not amazingly well, unfortunately. But still a great game nonetheless.\n\nOne difference, which I must say is not better nor worse but probably worth mentioning, is the stealth aspect of the gameplay suffered a big blow. The level design emphasizes platforming, the vision cone of the enemies is not as reliable as it used to and you can't easily tell where the shadows are just by looking at the screen. What makes this dead clear is that not once while playing this game I looked at my visibility meter, I completely forgot it existed. It's almost irrelevant now.\n\nI always thought the level designers working on stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ were brilliant! Well, that is absolutely still there. Very clever, fluid and challenging. It is a rare thing for me to stop while playing a game to admire the amazing cleverness of the level in front of me and this happens frequently here.\n\nNow for the big problem I have with the game: open world map with metroidvania elements. Why, why must I witness game after game making the same exact mistake. Any game that contains puzzle elements, like complex platforming, stealth or old plain box pushing have the same limitation: no immediate replay value. Once you solved the puzzle, giving it to you to solve again will not bring any new experience, satisfaction or challenge. Backtracking through a door you already know the combination is not a challenge but a chore. That's why it didn't work on Fez, that's why it didn't work on Thief 3 and Thief 4 and that is why it didn't work on Stealth Inc 2.\n\nAt first I was keeping an open mind about it. They have great level designers, maybe they figured a way to keep the nonlinear map an interesting aspect of the game. For a while it did, navigation was easy, one part led to another, stealth elements were rightfully kept to a minimum and so on. But inevitably the player will take a wrong turn and get lost on a map of solved puzzles and that's when the tediousness strikes. I kept desperately clicking on the map screen hoping there was a warp-to feature, so I can finally get to the next test room, the part of the game that is worth my time.\n\nAnyway, if you can swallow this annoying aspect of the game, the test rooms are a blast! Precision platforming with interesting new mechanics being added as the game progresses all designed masterfully. There are also additional challenges as usual for replay value.","August 31, 2015","true","5.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

After the first set of test chambers, each successive set (at least so far--I just finished the third) introduces a new gadget. Along with new robots, this enables a wider variety of puzzles compared to the first game where using gadgets was just for fun (except for the Teleporter Chambers, of course). In fact, that's probably the best way to imagine the test chambers in this game--like the teleporter DLC from the first game but more variety.\n\nThe next big change is the overworld--all of the test chambers are connected via a Metroidvania style overworld. After each set of test chambers that features a gadget, you get to use that gadget in the overworld, opening up passage to the next area as well as to numerous secrets and challenges.\n\nMy only real complaint so far is that it's not as clear as in most Metroidvania games when you are missing the right item to proceed, or when you simply haven't figured out the puzzle. This is somewhat due to the nature of the gadgets--there isn't a really obvious obstacle like a different color door, for example. On the first playthrough you have no idea what the upcoming gadgets are so you can't realize, "Oh, I will be able to come back here when I unlock gadget X."\n\nThis is a very minor complaint and I figured out my error with a bit of Googling (someone else had the exact same confusion) so it is very easy for me to recommend this game to both fans of the first Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥/Stealth Inc. game, and to anyone looking for a Metroidvania puzzle game.","May 17, 2015","true","11.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It seems the devs only care about consoles now, as this is obviously a port (though the change in name to the Console-approved one gives that away).\nThere is no proper options menu, you can only select resolution and anti-aliasing quality, or rebind keys through a launcher before the game starts. Stealth B-astard Deluxe had Steam Cloud support, but annoyingly that is also absent from this outing. And the worst change, the game is now tied to the framerate. If I play this on my low-spec laptop, the game runs in slow-motion, with sounds playing normally but the game taking ages to move. I play it on my PC, and the game runs at unplayable extremely fast speeds. There is no VSync option anywhere to be found, so I can barely play. You have a 144hz monitor? The you're out of luck. And although this hasn't affected me, many players have had problems running the game in the first place.\nIt's really disappointing because mechanics like the Inflate-a-Mate look really interesting to experiment with, but the moment I uninstall this game everything I've done will be lost as they didn't add Steam Cloud support. It's like they threw it out on Steam, added some achievements and left it.\nIf you enjoyed the original Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, then get this on a sale.

I was imagining something else. It is more of a platformer and has in my mind not any real stealth like any stealth game I know. It is actually quite frustrating and very little game-play in terms of taking your time and finguring out how to be stealthy etc. If you do, you'll get a low score, and/or get killed.\n\nIn terms of being a platformer, I just think it is not offering anything special, unique or new. Grapchically it is nothing to write home about either. It is not a bad game, it just has nothing to offer that not other games has done much better. I find the title misleading. It is just a normal platformer where you avoid stuff like in any other platformer. But stealth?

You will be doing the same thing to the same 4 tunes, to the same eviroment over and over. At first the game seams like fun , but once you get to area 2, you will see how it repeats.\n\nThe game encourages speed running through levels as fast as possible, but this extremly hard to do. Getting the S-rank often determaind by second or two. The top scores look impossible to pull off unless you cheat or break the game. The second problem is the level design starts to require you to slow down and wait, which can punish you if you make one mistake.  One level hasd it where if you screw up a enemy pattern, you can lose 20 seconds. The thrid problem is when it starts to require the inflatable. You often have to slow down to aim and perfecting the inflatable jumps is a pain due to the jump button being assigned to the triggers.\n\nThe game also has issues with creative soundcards that still hasn't been fixed by the devs depsite them knowing since the lauch of the game. The fix is on pcgamewiki, but if you don't know of it, you wouldn't be able to play the game.\n\nI got this for free from humble bundle and I can see why it was released that way.

I got this for free on the Humble Store\n\nAt first I was pretty excited for it. I heard some good things about it and I really like stealth games. Now: This game has barely any stealth elements. It is a platformer and NOT a stealth game. Now I like platformers, too, so I kept going. My next complaint is the "dialog". It tries to be like GLaDOS from Portal but it fails spectacularly. Instead of clever jokes and sadistic messages spoken by a sassy computer lady, you get boring text on the wall that is barely related to the situation. And the text mostly consists of generic villain lines like "Please just die!" or some bad joke like "I am gonna miss my favourite TV show like this!". Next on the list: the puzzles. The "puzzles" are not really puzzles. Instead you just do tasks in a specific pre-defined order. You don't even have to think. You just press a button, go through door, press next button, go through next door, jump over a hole and you are done. The only difficulty comes from the enemies and traps but they work on such simple patterns that they barely pose a threat. Another thing I wanted to mention is the bosses, or should I say boss.

I got this for free on the Humble Store\n\nAt first I was pretty excited for it. I heard some good things about it and I really like stealth games. Now: This game has barely any stealth elements. It is a platformer and NOT a stealth game. Now I like platformers, too, so I kept going. My next complaint is the "dialog". It tries to be like GLaDOS from Portal but it fails spectacularly. Instead of clever jokes and sadistic messages spoken by a sassy computer lady, you get boring text on the wall that is barely related to the situation. And the text mostly consists of generic villain lines like "Please just die!" or some bad joke like "I am gonna miss my favourite TV show like this!". Next on the list: the puzzles. The "puzzles" are not really puzzles. Instead you just do tasks in a specific pre-defined order. You don't even have to think. You just press a button, go through door, press next button, go through next door, jump over a hole and you are done. The only difficulty comes from the enemies and traps but they work on such simple patterns that they barely pose a threat. Another thing I wanted to mention is the bosses, or should I say boss. Yes, every boss is the same exact enemy with a different level around it. I played until the third time I met the boss and then I just gave up on this game. Oh, and don't even get me started on the story. They just copied it from Oddworld: Abe's Odysee!\n\nMy verdict: Stealth Inc 2 is a boring generic platformer with streamlined puzzles, an unoriginal story and embarassing dialog.

Moving blocks is slow and not precise. (That's why it's almost IMPOSSIBLE to enjoy creating your own levels) The world that creators gave us to explore seemed like an amazing idea, but it's just something to make moving between test far longer and filled with enemies. Horrible checkpoints are not saving it at all. I'm trying to give this game more time but when comparing it to stealth b a s t a r d... This is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port from Wii U.\n\nGameplay        6/10                Graphics        9/10                Music        7/10                Editor        2/10\nFinal Verdict\nI'm going to give this game 5/10 because i expected it to be better from Stealth B a s t a r d. It's still pretty fun BUT after normal game nothing is left to do because editor is just not finished. If you want a good game about stealth GET STEALTH B A S T A R D ! IT'S WAY BETTER!\n\nEDIT (14-06-2014): Oh and i forgot to mention the WORST controlls of the history. The character is handling good but using gadgets is a nightmare! The cursor keeps disappearing, so you can't see where are you aiming, and throwing gadgets itself is a clear lottery! Sometimes clone will drop the gadget, sometimes he'll throw it, and sometimes he's just going to stand like an idiot and do nothing! Waiting for death from lasers! Because of that i'm lowering final score from 6 to 5 and gameplay from 8 to 6 because this was making me insane!","May 24, 2015","false","11.6"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","10","23","0","2"

(The original name derived from the idea that the game itself was a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ -- it's a stealth game where being noticed almost always results in instant death.) As is common in the genre, some levels also require precision timing. I think there's less of that in this game than in the original, however; it seemed generally easier to me and I think that is the platforming and not the puzzles.\n\nA number of negative reviews here note terrible performance issues and crashes. It has run fine for me on an old PC, with no instability at all.\n\nGood bits:\nStealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe was based on Game Maker; the sequel has a completely new engine which looks a lot better.\n\nThere is a new Metroidvania-ish "overworld" containing doors to the actual levels. In the original game, secret levels were unlocked by finding helices. I much prefer the system here where they are simply hidden in the relevant sectors. In effect, the overworld provides a large number of extra puzzles, some of which are much harder than the test chambers themselves. (I particularly enjoyed working out how to get the camouflage.)\n\nSecret locations hidden in the overworld allow you to dress your clone in FANCY HATS!\n\nGadgets in the original game could only be used after completing the levels without them. Here, each zone is themed around a different gadget, so you get ten chambers requiring the Inflate-A-Mate, ten needing the Jack Boy, etc. This works particularly well because of the overworld, which provides a space for puzzles requiring all gadgets. Level design is excellent.\nDownsides:\n\nMajor backtracking is required later in the game.\n\nSome gadgets are just more enjoyable than others, e.g. I found the Jack Boy puzzles much less fun.\n\nSome levels seem to require annoying feats of dexterity. Many puzzles require throwing gadgets; precision is possible but not fun to do at speed, e.g. because a killer buzzsaw is closing in on you.\n\nIt's got a cute story, but it can't top the hilarious reveal at the end of Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe.","March 26","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is still the same kind of platformer that you can expect from the first game; same dark humor, same dark visuals, same dark story; but it throws on a bit of a touch of cuteness every now and again with the new sounds and with the slight change in character design; making the player character look more like how he appears in the little images featured in the first game.  But probably the best part about the whole game is that its graphical upgrades do not detract at all from gameplay; it still plays nearly exactly like the original Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, albeit with more to do/explore and making the optional gadgets that you can unlock in the first game an actual use.\n\nAnyone who are fans of the original should give this one a try if they haven't yet already.  I can guarantee you that you'll have just as much fun.  For the few poor clones who haven't yet had a crack at this, if you enjoy puzzle platformers with a sense of old-school unlocks and difficulty progression that makes you grit your teeth every time you die and gives you that immense drive of "I WILL BEAT THIS GAME" with every new run, you will definitely enjoy this.","March 28","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every chapter you get a new gadget that you have to test in at least 8 test chambers. This switches up the gameplay pretty frequently but not too fast, since in those chambers you can only use that one specific gadget so things dont get too clustered. In the hub world tho, after completing the testing you recieve the tested gadget and can (and often have to) use it in the hub world to get to the next area. Also, the gadgets are all different and have unique uses, delievering a game experience that doesn't get dull and entertained me until the end and even further. The stealth is also well made and easy to use with a bar that shows your visibility. You often need to hide in the shadows to take out or sneak around your enemies and especially in the boss levels (which are awesome), you have to manipulate and use the shadows in order to progress.\n\nThe story is nice.  A clone that has to save other clones and a bad guy trying to stop him	 is maybe not the best story, but the narative is done very well. The antagonist's words are being projected onto the walls as you progress through the level which is a nice alternative way of making him "speak" (there is no voice acting). I also like how he speaks to you, as he switches between sarcastic, caring and hate, aswell as making fun of you when dying in hilarious ways.\n\nThe aesthetics is nothing special. Cute characters in an acceptable looking world. It won't give you eye cancer but it is certaintly not an eye candy but since it is a 2D scroller you don't expect the best graphics.\n\nThe controls are are semi-good. The movement is very responsive and accurate but the throwing of gadgets (what you go a lot) is sometimes frustrating. Even in fullscreen mode, my mouse (I have a triple monitor setup) when onto another screen, resulting in the game being unfocuses and me having to click onto my main screen again. Disabling your other monitors might fix it. But even without this, the aiming is hard since you can't see where your mouse cursor is and the movement of the camera can mess with your throws.\n\nFrom a technicals side I only had the problem I mentioned in the controls with a multi monitor setup. No framedrops or crashes but I heard some had a .dll problem that has working fixes in the guides and reviews. The optionsmenu is a bit limited but offers everything you need: Resolution, fullscreen, a bit AA, rebindable controls for keyboard and controller, brightness, as well as two volume sliders. Also, I runs at 60 FPS at default. Some say it runs poorly on their system but I can't say that about mine (i3570 + GTX 660).\n\nI also comes with a level editor which contains some very challenging levels and allows for infinite new content.\n\nOverall, Stealth Inc 2: A Game of Clones is a very well made stealth platformer with good, challenging puzzles that doesn't get dull thanks to new game elements that are frequently added. If you either like puzzles, stealth or platformers or need in gerenal a good game, definitely go for it.","March 2","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to navigate a maze of puzzles to even locate the tests you need to pass in order to progress in the game. Since it's a maze and the game doesn't tell you where you actually need to go, there's a ton of trial and error to figure out how to progress to the next test. Annoyingly, this involves going through the same puzzles with the same very slowly moving enemies you have to wait for repeatedly.\n\nSolving a puzzle one is fun and interesting. Solving a puzzle once, then going through the motions another 5+ times simply because the game doesn't communicate where you need to go is terrible and annoying. I finally gave up on the game after spending 20 minutes trying to find out how to get to the next test, only to hit yet another dead end (which took a few minutes of puzzle solving and slowly waiting for enemies to hit triggers to get to, and which I'd have to go through again repeatedly to check if something had triggered the route to open up).\n\nI enjoyed the actual tests once I got to them. Everything in between the tests was awful. If you played the first game, this is pretty much that, plus a ton of annoying stuff thrown in every so often to completely ruin the experience.","September 26, 2015","false","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MysteryAlex/recommended/329380/","MysteryAlex","I Aten't Dead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MysteryAlex/","258 products in account","Goodness this was unexpected! Stealth Inc 2 is a sequel that does a great job standing on its own two stubby feet and distancing itself from its predescesor. But loses a bit of its identity (slightly) in the process.\n\nTo start, Stealth Inc 2 (or Sneaky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2 if you want to call it that) mirrors the beginning of the original but adds a few twists along the way. Soon enough you're loose in the killer facility to do whatever little stubby clones do. The relationship between your cloned companion and your caretaker who was prideful enough to unleash you in the first place mirrors that of Chell against GLaDOS from Portal, but goes on a bit longer to great effect. And for the most part this drives the game as he conspires against you, providing a number of the game's challenges (and again, great dialogue, not as hillarious but still filled with snark and a ton of fun).\n\nIn a number of twists, Stealth Inc 2 is seperated between test chambers and exploring the facility. In test chambers you can rescue clones and learn how to utilize intreguing gadgets, all of which were optional unlockables in the first game. After eight levels with this gadget, you get to toss it around in the facility to help you maneuver and get to other test chambers along with picking up various collectables. While the facility itself is incredibly linear, it becomes a puzzle in its own right later in the game and feels much more open than it actually is. That said, there's no easy way around the facility minus creating shortcuts and it gets incredibly confusing to navigate as time goes on and you open up more of the facility. If you're looking for secret test chambers or collectables, navigation is often times more tedius than rewarding. Really a warping system of some sort or even an improved more detailed map would have made things a lot better.\n\nHowever, Stealth Inc 2 (appropriately) focuses on the gadgets more than its original core gameplay this time around. While it keeps it from feeling like an expansion pack, there are a lot of moments where I felt like it could have still been utilized rather than put to the side as much as it had. Again, I feel like it was a smart choice to focus on these gadgets, but it severely weakened its original selling point.\n\nDespite that, Stealth Inc 2 is still a lot of fun to play, but it's highly recommended to play the original first. There's a fair bit going on and understanding and perfecting the core game can make it easier to navigate this time around. Overall, a solid recommendation.","September 9, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So did I.  Apparently, the result is something like Stealth Inc 2... a platforming puzzle game that rewards quick wit, puzzle solving skills, and reflexes in equal measure.  The single-player campaign is a linear story told in a motion comic style with fairly good writing (especially for a game whose main focus isn't the story).  While the story itself is linear, the levels still allow plenty of room for exploration.  You'll find you can go a lot more places than just the straightest path to the next Test Chamber, though your advancement through the map is gated by puzzles that require a specific gadget to solve, so it's not completely open.\n\nTo give you an idea of how addictive this game is... I sat down at about 8 pm last night to play it for "a few hours".  When I finally chanced a glance at the clock, it was 5 am.  9 hours of my life sucked into the struggle to get past the next test or unlock a little mohawk for my clone, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat, much to my boss's chagrin.

So did I.  Apparently, the result is something like Stealth Inc 2... a platforming puzzle game that rewards quick wit, puzzle solving skills, and reflexes in equal measure.  The single-player campaign is a linear story told in a motion comic style with fairly good writing (especially for a game whose main focus isn't the story).  While the story itself is linear, the levels still allow plenty of room for exploration.  You'll find you can go a lot more places than just the straightest path to the next Test Chamber, though your advancement through the map is gated by puzzles that require a specific gadget to solve, so it's not completely open.\n\nTo give you an idea of how addictive this game is... I sat down at about 8 pm last night to play it for "a few hours".  When I finally chanced a glance at the clock, it was 5 am.  9 hours of my life sucked into the struggle to get past the next test or unlock a little mohawk for my clone, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat, much to my boss's chagrin.

Although that in no way impacts your score/time.)\n\nGraphics:There are only 3 options in the video menu when you fire up this game, Resolution settings, MSAA and Fullscreen on & off. Visually this game feels C-3PO having sex without lube, choppy and joyless  even more so if you try to run it on fullscreen mode with the highest resolution your monitor can support. And the MSAA doesnt seem to do much either as it only goes as far as 4x.\nSome sequences in the game do feel nice with ivory lights casting their dark shadows. It helps to some extent to set a tone which quickly fades when you  pass through them.\n\nSound:The game offers around 47 different soundtracks which switch ramdomly, although being assigned to maps. Ranging from melodies snatched from a party with raging alcoholics to calm and plesent ones. They seem to work well with the gameplay trying to sound different and interesting. Definately memorable at that.\n\nGameplay:The gameplay offers nothing new. It carries its gameplay mechanics from various other games in the market like  the Portal series and Dustforce. All you do is run around in a test facility consisting of 6 maps with 8 levels in each,  clearing test segments something like the game  Dustfroce which are suppose to add a non-linear feal. You mostly find yourself evading and/or tricking sensors that trigger traps (more so often they are lasers) or some moving with laser or sensors on it. All this  with a few gadgets at your disposal that you get every new map you advance.\nThe thing with games like these is that they are ment to be repetative but given the situation with this, it starts becoming more of a chore.\nThe game does try to keep it fresh by letting you make your own map and upload it to its community right from the game application itself. Which others would then play and rate.\n\nPlot:You are a clone in a test facility that finds you more disposable than paper cups. Helping as many of your fellow clones as possible you must now try to escape this wretched place of effective  laser traps! All this while you are kinda being provoked by the antagonist as he wants to watch you fall/fail/die trying  so he can win 'Employee of the month'.\n\nAnd well, finally,  the game was ported to pc from Wii U. Maybe thats whats wrong with this game, that affects its visuals which keep you from enjoying it. At the end of the day, you don't have that feeling to come back for more which derives me to the  conclusion buy it on sale if you must.","September 2, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to navigate a maze of puzzles to even locate the tests you need to pass in order to progress in the game. Since it's a maze and the game doesn't tell you where you actually need to go, there's a ton of trial and error to figure out how to progress to the next test. Annoyingly, this involves going through the same puzzles with the same very slowly moving enemies you have to wait for repeatedly.\n\nSolving a puzzle one is fun and interesting. Solving a puzzle once, then going through the motions another 5+ times simply because the game doesn't communicate where you need to go is terrible and annoying. I finally gave up on the game after spending 20 minutes trying to find out how to get to the next test, only to hit yet another dead end (which took a few minutes of puzzle solving and slowly waiting for enemies to hit triggers to get to, and which I'd have to go through again repeatedly to check if something had triggered the route to open up).\n\nI enjoyed the actual tests once I got to them. Everything in between the tests was awful.

The character, like the gameplay, is somewhat uninteresting, but if you give it time, the game wins you over with some creative puzzle challenges involving quick movement, strategic thought, and stealth.\n\nThis game was fun for a time, but it quickly became tedious to play.  Perhaps a person with a greater aptitude for platformers than myself would enjoy the challenge, but this game does not offer the same slick moves found in games like Super Meat Boy and simply punishes the player for wanting to explore at all.  For example, if you are curious what's at the bottom of a pit where the door is closed, you jump down there, but then, you realize it's a dead end and have to restart the level from the beginning rather than simply a redo like when you die.  If you die, it seems smart enough to simply place you back at the last checkpoint, so why not just give us a suicide/redo button?\n\nOverall, it's a good 2D stealth platforming game with a professional quality presentation.  It should offer well over the 93 minutes I played if you want to continue through the tougher challenges, but if you're like me, it's just too much challenge and not enough fun.  The character is somewhat lovable but ultimately bland and uninteresting.  That said, it's well worth the asking price, especially for a game I got in a low-priced bundle deal, because it offers a very high quality stealth puzzle experience.  Worth delving into even if you only get an hour out of it.","September 30, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every chapter you get a new gadget that you have to test in at least 8 test chambers. This switches up the gameplay pretty frequently but not too fast, since in those chambers you can only use that one specific gadget so things dont get too clustered. In the hub world tho, after completing the testing you recieve the tested gadget and can (and often have to) use it in the hub world to get to the next area. Also, the gadgets are all different and have unique uses, delievering a game experience that doesn't get dull and entertained me until the end and even further. The stealth is also well made and easy to use with a bar that shows your visibility. You often need to hide in the shadows to take out or sneak around your enemies and especially in the boss levels (which are awesome), you have to manipulate and use the shadows in order to progress.\n\nThe story is nice.  A clone that has to save other clones and a bad guy trying to stop him	 is maybe not the best story, but the narative is done very well. The antagonist's words are being projected onto the walls as you progress through the level which is a nice alternative way of making him "speak" (there is no voice acting). I also like how he speaks to you, as he switches between sarcastic, caring and hate, aswell as making fun of you when dying in hilarious ways.\n\nThe aesthetics is nothing special. Cute characters in an acceptable looking world. It won't give you eye cancer but it is certaintly not an eye candy but since it is a 2D scroller you don't expect the best graphics.\n\nThe controls are are semi-good. The movement is very responsive and accurate but the throwing of gadgets (what you go a lot) is sometimes frustrating. Even in fullscreen mode, my mouse (I have a triple monitor setup) when onto another screen, resulting in the game being unfocuses and me having to click onto my main screen again. Disabling your other monitors might fix it. But even without this, the aiming is hard since you can't see where your mouse cursor is and the movement of the camera can mess with your throws.\n\nFrom a technicals side I only had the problem I mentioned in the controls with a multi monitor setup. No framedrops or crashes but I heard some had a .dll problem that has working fixes in the guides and reviews. The optionsmenu is a bit limited but offers everything you need: Resolution, fullscreen, a bit AA, rebindable controls for keyboard and controller, brightness, as well as two volume sliders. Also, I runs at 60 FPS at default. Some say it runs poorly on their system but I can't say that about mine (i3570 + GTX 660).\n\nI also comes with a level editor which contains some very challenging levels and allows for infinite new content.\n\nOverall, Stealth Inc 2: A Game of Clones is a very well made stealth platformer with good, challenging puzzles that doesn't get dull thanks to new game elements that are frequently added. If you either like puzzles, stealth or platformers or need in gerenal a good game, definitely go for it.","March 2","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The level design is well thought-out, the puzzles are challenging without becoming 'fake' difficulty, the controls are fairly intuitive, and the graphics are nice...but the performance issues let everything down. Unless you're one of what seems to be a very small minority, the game can and will run extremely slowly, either at random or because there's something about your computer that it doesn't like (not sure which one). For me, on one system at least, it was the sound card - removed it and switched over to onboard sound troubleshooting something else recently (and forgetting to put the original sound card back in), and I can run at normal speed about 75% of  the time now, though that's in windowed mode at a lower resolution instead of fullscreen, which seems to be one of the more common issues. The other 25% of the time, it runs like tar for no apparent reason, with a reboot occasionally (but not always) bringing it back again. The devs are seemingly aware of the problem(s), but don't appear to be coming out with any patches to help resolve things.\n\nThe times I can run the game normally, it's fun. But unless it's on sale or part of a bundle, I couldn't recommend it except if the slowdown bugs get patched.","January 10","false","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ffrinch/recommended/329380/","ffrinch","ffrinch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ffrinch/","351 products in account","Stellar sequel to Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe that generally improves on the original.\n\nGameplay is essentially the same as the first game, i.e. it's much more of a puzzle platformer than a stealth game. (The original name derived from the idea that the game itself was a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ -- it's a stealth game where being noticed almost always results in instant death.) As is common in the genre, some levels also require precision timing. I think there's less of that in this game than in the original, however; it seemed generally easier to me and I think that is the platforming and not the puzzles.\n\nA number of negative reviews here note terrible performance issues and crashes. It has run fine for me on an old PC, with no instability at all.\n\nGood bits:\nStealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe was based on Game Maker; the sequel has a completely new engine which looks a lot better.\n\nThere is a new Metroidvania-ish "overworld" containing doors to the actual levels. In the original game, secret levels were unlocked by finding helices. I much prefer the system here where they are simply hidden in the relevant sectors. In effect, the overworld provides a large number of extra puzzles, some of which are much harder than the test chambers themselves. (I particularly enjoyed working out how to get the camouflage.)\n\nSecret locations hidden in the overworld allow you to dress your clone in FANCY HATS!\n\nGadgets in the original game could only be used after completing the levels without them. Here, each zone is themed around a different gadget, so you get ten chambers requiring the Inflate-A-Mate, ten needing the Jack Boy, etc. This works particularly well because of the overworld, which provides a space for puzzles requiring all gadgets. Level design is excellent.\nDownsides:\n\nMajor backtracking is required later in the game.\n\nSome gadgets are just more enjoyable than others, e.g. I found the Jack Boy puzzles much less fun.\n\nSome levels seem to require annoying feats of dexterity. Many puzzles require throwing gadgets; precision is possible but not fun to do at speed, e.g. because a killer buzzsaw is closing in on you.\n\nIt's got a cute story, but it can't top the hilarious reveal at the end of Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe.","March 26","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is still the same kind of platformer that you can expect from the first game; same dark humor, same dark visuals, same dark story; but it throws on a bit of a touch of cuteness every now and again with the new sounds and with the slight change in character design; making the player character look more like how he appears in the little images featured in the first game.  But probably the best part about the whole game is that its graphical upgrades do not detract at all from gameplay; it still plays nearly exactly like the original Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, albeit with more to do/explore and making the optional gadgets that you can unlock in the first game an actual use.\n\nAnyone who are fans of the original should give this one a try if they haven't yet already.  I can guarantee you that you'll have just as much fun.  For the few poor clones who haven't yet had a crack at this, if you enjoy puzzle platformers with a sense of old-school unlocks and difficulty progression that makes you grit your teeth every time you die and gives you that immense drive of "I WILL BEAT THIS GAME" with every new run, you will definitely enjoy this.","March 28","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But instead, it was long enough to last 2 entire days to finish.\n\nYou're a clone (some kind of fatty "boy" wearing green glass as you can see) among many others, and apparently you're smarter than the others. Your objective is to progress through the company's different areas to perform test (and free the other clones in the test rooms). As you progress, you'll discover new gadgets to use in test rooms. And once you've completed the 8th test of the current area, you'll be able to use the gadgets outside of the test rooms.\n\nAs you might have guessed, we have to hide from the enemies if we don't want to die, and the shadows are really useful for it.\n\nPros :\n- 50 levels to entertain you at least an entire day.\n- Some gadgets might be entertaining to use.\n- Collectable hats and clothes for your characters (I love to wear both the Police Hat and Uniform).\n- The overworld map (which displays the explored areas of the company) somehow reminds me of Super Metroid.\n- I honestly didn't expected this game to have some kind of story.\n\nCons :\n- Although the story was getting more and more interesting, the ending was poorly normal.\n- I honestly wish there was a better way to switch between gagdets, because the way the scrolling was made wasn't practical at all\n- Despite shadow and darkness being really useful to hide and my ability to see in the dark, there's some part of the games where the developers decided to put no lighting at all. Despite having a Light gadget, travelling through these areas are still a real pain\n- As in Super Metroid, there's no way to teleport through a part of the map to another, so you're gonna have to walk alot to travel from bottom left to upper right\n- Apparently, the CEO of the PTi company asked for the building to be built as a maze, because I sometime have alot of trouble to get to the next room, despite the map clearly showing a way between both rooms.\n- Community High Score is quite full of hacker (trust me, none of the test rooms can be done in 0.1 second).","May 8","true","28.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
