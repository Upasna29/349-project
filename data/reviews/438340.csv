The rain soaked atmosphere is very relaxing. It's not as dark as Dear Esther. The colours are quite muted, but that's appropriate for an overcast day. The landscape contains various locations and objects of interest and it's worth looking around to find things you might otherwise miss.\n\nOccasional voice narration enhances the experience. It's extremely poetic and descriptive, painting pictures in words to further enhance the visuals. There's also relaxing music providing a soundtrack to your journey. It's pleasant enough to listen to but can get repetitive at times. I usually turn music off once that happens (which it does with all games), and often play without music or replace it with music of my own choice. It would be nice to have that option added. It's enjoyable enough just listening to the rain IMO.\n\nThere are many excellent opportunities for screenshots in this game, which can extend the gameplay time considerably. There's a control to zoom out to give a wider angle of view and another to crouch, which can provide you with a different viewpoint. You can even change to a grainy, monochrome view which gives a completely different look to the game, and is good for "arty" screenshots.\n\nIn spite of the overcast sky, sunlight does stream through gaps in the clouds. Unusually it shines from multiple directions. Perhaps this planet orbits multiple suns? This sunlight causes purple lens flare, which often looks appealing, but sometimes I felt there was a bit too much of it and I wished I could turn it off. UPDATE: If you set filter effects to medium or low the lens flare will be disabled.\n\nIt may be worth noting that I have not experienced any of the micro-stutters than mrorange mentioned in his review.\n\nI don't understand what everything means in this game because I haven't completed it yet. In fact, I've only been exploring the green path so far (there are two different paths through the game), but after three hours I think I've experienced enough to write this review. I'll update it once I've played more. Unfortunately I suffer from motion sickness in first person games so I can't play them for too long without feeling ill. I also take loads of screenshots so it'll take me a lot longer to complete than if I simply walked through it all without stopping.\n\nOverall this is a very pleasant visual and aural experience (rather than a game) which I recommend to anyone who enjoys simply walking around and looking at beautiful scenery. It's a treat to the senses and is ideal for relaxation when you feel like taking a break from more demanding games.\n\nDisclaimer: a key was provided by the developer in return for an unbiased review, which is the only kind of review I'm willing to write.","March 6","true","3.1"," 47 of 52 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","47","52","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexspeed/recommended/438340/","alexspeed","Alexspeed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexspeed/","6187 products in account","Drizzlepath: Genie is a fascinating and very atmospheric game that offers exploration along two different paths and a well presented and narrated storyline for both of them. Both paths you can walk are exclusive to each other, so to experience the whole game you have to play it twice. That does not really get repetitive tough, because they are very different from each other, both in story and in presentation.\n\nI don't want to spoil too much of the story, but it is about a young girl that takes a journey to find something mysterious, and the journey becomes more then just the path that she walks. She will either find or loose herself on the way, and with it, the whole world around her.  You also don't need to know anything about the first Drizzlepath game, or have played it. This is an evolution of its concept, and a great one at that, but not a continuation of the story.\n\nThe majority of the gameplay involves walking along one of both paths (with possibilities to explore alongside it), listening to beautifully delivered and voiced narration, and finding scenic views while you wander. Both paths together will take you about four hours to finish, but if you explore and take screenshots (and you should totally do that) it could take much longer. The ambiance and graphics are great and help you to immerse yourself in the game world, the world of Drizzlepath is a worthwhile experience in my opinion.\n\nOn gameplay elements there is not much in this game, but more then in the first Drizzlepath. There is a pressure plate on one path and a switch to activate on the other, and also a rock you have to break. There are also stones falling down on both paths, but you don't have to actively evade them. And there are also a handfull of jumping sections. There is also no falling damage, you can explore without fear of dying, you might get stuck sometimes eventually, but you can start over from your last checkpoint at all times, so thats not a problem. And there are a lot of hidden things to find while we are at that.\n\nThe best part is probably the beautiful female voice you get to listen to. The story that is told is not always easy to follow tough, it is very poetic and full of difficult concepts, life and death, loss and anger, faith and spirituality, there is something for everyone here. The optional subtitles that you can enable make it also easier to follow the story.\n\nThe good thing is, if the story is not your thing, you can just tune out and explore the scenery and still have a good time. But if you like that kind of narration, it will probably blow you away, leave you pondering and questioning. The music is fitting to the narrative, its very good most of the time, but can get a bit repetitive if you stay in one aerea of the game for a longer time.\n\nTechnically the game is demanding. If you have an older PC you might have to turn down resolutions and graphical options to get it running smoothly. I think there is still room for optimization for this game in that regard. The user interface and options menu is probably my biggest negative point. It is spartanic and there is no key rebinding sadly, and also no separate sound sliders for music and voice. Another thing i noticed is that the game does not like alt-tabbing at all, you want to avoid that while you play this game.\n\nI personally had a great time with the game and liked most the many screenshot opportunities the game offers. With all that said, if you don't like slow-paced games without action, then this game might not be interesting for you. The walking is slow, you can not run. This is about relaxing and experiencing. If you can appreciate its beauty and accept it for what it is, you will probably enjoy Drizzlepath: Genie.\n\nReview DisclaimerThe game was provided for free and i am working currently on the German translation of this game. I also did Beta testing and provided technical and marketing advice to the Developer. This review is still as unbiased as possible with this involvement.","February 23","true","22.1"," 56 of 71 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","56","71","3","20"

The story is narrated and you can have the option to have the text displayed (settings) like me. I enjoyed reading beside the narrator.\n\nAs you are walking you are also exploring and in some rare cases interacting with the surroundings.\nYou are also challenged in the journey with some jumping areas which are honestly easy.\n\nStoryline\n\nThe game is about a chosen girl that begins a journey through you..\nYour village is in trouble.. and it is up to you to walk and find this Genie..\nYour journey takes you far and the path you take will affect the ending.\nThe game talks about some life experiences which I enjoyed the most.\n\nThe music compliments the narration but at times I feel it overpowers her voice.\nAt times you find yourself so emerged in the scenery, the sounds of the rain and beautiful landscape you tone out everything else. I for one find it relaxing hearing the rain and looking at streams.\n\nFinal thoughts?\n\nIf you want a first experience on a walking sim this is a good start. Final note I was given a key for a honest review without any commitments either then the review of my experience. Thank you for the chance to play a beautiful game.\nDefinitely would recommend the game in its current state.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Almatarie/recommended/438340/","Almatarie","Sweetheart Gamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Almatarie/","4087 products in account","The term 'walking simulator' was first tossed around to be an insult towards games that some deemed to be 'not really a game'. For some though, sitting down to a game that's relaxing and likely visually pleasing can be a tranquil experience, and no less of a 'game' than any other. Lately though, you see the term 'walking simulator' being applied to just about any first person game that doesn't let you shoot things. Even games heavy on platforming or difficult puzzle solving. Drizzlepath: Genie however, is your classic 'walking simulator' with soothing music, pretty scenery, and a story to tell.\n\nYou play as Lula, your goal is to find the Genie, and you have been cursed with the inability to run. That's right, this is quite literally a walking simulator. I'm not sure if that was meant as a joke (because if so, it was a really good one), as you usually can't run in games like this, with no explanation provided. At the beginning of the game, you are presented with two paths to take. Each will give you a different narrated tale along your journey. One path will lead you to what is technically the 'good ending' and the other the 'bad'. One path is also significantly longer than the other, so strap on your good hiking boots. The longer path does feel perhaps a bit too long. While it's broken up with things to see, most of it is the same environment and begins to wear you down with it's 'sameness'. It is worth it to replay the game for the alternate path however, as it is different, especially if you pick the longer path first.\n\nThe music is enjoyable, mixed with the sound of rain and occasional thunder (though the rain is more prevalent on one of the paths than the other) it makes for a nice ambiance. I played with the graphics cranked up to max and it looked quite nice, my only personal complaint being a lack of resolution that fit my monitor, but I know 21:9 is hardly standard, I only wish I could have had a nice full screen view of everything.\n\nDrizzlepath: Genie certainly isn't a game for everyone. The majority of it is much like a pleasant hike, minus the actual physical exertion. So if that isn't your kind of thing, then you probably won't enjoy this.  But if you're in the mood to sit back, relax, listen to a story, while meandering through nature, it's definitely worth a look.\n\nDisclaimer: A key was provided by the developer in exchange for an unbiased review.","March 4","true","5.7"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","32","37","0","2"

I would say a better laptop or PC with a later graphics card would give a more pristine and better result, but Im more than happy with the result I have seen so far ! :)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=637022609\n\nDrizzlepath: Genie is classed as a "walking simulater" these types of games are very relaxing and a joy to play. While you are exploring the enjoying the gorgeous scenery and picturesque views, you will also be following a story and listening to a wonderfully voiced lady narrator, she is a real pleasure to listen to, and she does the story telling so very well, also you will listen to some soft tranquil music while progressing through the game. The game will save everytime after the narrator speaks a paragraph of the story as you move further into the country. You will have a choice of 2 paths to take, the red path or the blue path. Once you finish 1 path of the story, you can go down the other path. I have finished the red path, and just started the blue path, and I am so impressed with the stunning scenery through out the game, from what I have seen so far. I feel like Im taking a nice stroll in the country, its so nice and relaxing.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=637025292\n\nI think for the work and detail that has gone into this lovely game, its priced very well and worth the full price plus more, but thats my opinion as a game like this would not be easy to bring together so very well.\n\nI dont know what else I can say about this game as there are some really well writen reviews that tell a better story than I can about this game. All I can say is The game is Absolutely Stunning, and its a huge Thumbs up from me\n\n10/10 A lovely game by far. Well done to the developer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/akatarzynak/recommended/438340/","akatarzynak","AKatarzynaK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/akatarzynak/","388 products in account","Before I begin I want to note that I was provided with a key from the developer in exchange for reviewing this game. This did not in any way affect my interpretation of it and what follows is my honest unbiased opinion.\n\nDrizzlepath: Genie is a first-person linear exploration game. You play as a girl named Lula, who must go on a journey to unravel some mysterious truth that will determine the destiny of herself and her loved ones. The gameplay is simple; you walk forward following a clearly defined pathway while listening to the storyline as it unfolds during your journey. A wonderful feature of this game is the auto-walk button, which prevents you from spending the entirety of the game holding down the W key to move forward. There are a few occasions where you have to jump to reach the next area, but there is no falling damage so failing to do so merely means taking a few extra seconds to try again. However, it is worth mentioning that correctly timing your jumps can be tricky and get to be slightly frustrating until you get the hang of it.\n\nSoon after starting the game you will come to a fork in the road. Depending on which direction you choose you will end up with one of two different endings as well as a different narrative to accompany you on your journey. Because of this you can spend a decent amount of time in this game in order to unlock both of these paths and their end results. One path is considerably longer than the other and seems to drag on a bit too much at points as compared to the shorter path. There are some definite pacing issues with this path, and it could stand to be slightly shorter as I found myself wishing it could speed up a bit at times.\n\nThe landscape is gorgeous and well designed with clear attention to detail, causing you to really want to look around and take in your surroundings. Those who enjoy taking screenshots will be pleased to find plenty of opportunities for beautiful captures. The music that accompanies the game is serene and well matched with the environment. The sound effects, such as rain falling and thunder in the distance, are very well done and do quite a bit to set the atmosphere. The voice of Lula narrates throughout your journey and is one of my favorite aspects of the game, not so much for the voice acting but rather the content as the writing is beautiful and thoughtful, at times even poetic. There are also a fair amount easter eggs to be found if you look around a bit more carefully, something which makes exploring more interesting. All together these provide for a very aesthetically pleasing and calming environment that is very easy to get lost in.\n\nThis game is fairly demanding to run, and it seems that there is room for improvement as far as better optimizing it. While my PC is definitely not top of the line it can usually run new games on high/medium settings, but in order to run this properly I had to lower the settings a bit. This was not enough of an issue to prevent me from playing or enjoying the graphics it has to offer, but is worth noting for anyone with an outdated PC who is considering this purchase.\n\nIf you are not a fan of walking simulators you shouldn’t be surprised to hear that this is likely not a game for you. There is a certain level of patience required to appreciate this genre as it relies not on action and reflex but instead providing a nice atmosphere and a story to match. If you enjoy games in this vein and go into this knowing what you expect, you should find yourself pleased with the very calming and enriching experience which Drizzlepath: Genie has to offer.","February 28","true","6.7"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","31","38","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/poetplays/recommended/438340/","poetplays","Poet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/poetplays/","324 products in account","Drizzlepath: Genie is about a girl who takes a journey down one of two possible paths to discover what the "Genie" is, and what it could mean for her village and her future. If you're expecting the game to be anything but a narrative of sorts, turn back now as that is what this basically is when you break it down. No puzzles, no enemies, no difficulty involved - this is why people tend to say it's a "relaxing" experience.\n\nIt took me just over 2 hours to complete the game. You choose one of two paths at the beginning of the game. You are encouraged to take the second path at the completion of the game as it will offer a "different" experience, however I opted to let the credits roll and call it a night.\n\nThe gameplay itself is effortless. There are a couple "parkour areas" that you have to complete, but again, this is about the journey being more important than the destination... or... gameplay.. Right?\n\nSo let's pick it apart a little, shall we? Not because I hated it, but because I think that it really wasn't all that good. There was so much room for improvement and so many little things that bothered me adding up as I played, that I just have to be honest about disliking those things. Again, I didn't hate the game and actually enjoyed the couple hours it took me to "beat" one of the paths, but I'm not about to rave about it to all those who might listen.\n\nThe description of the game here on Steam defines it as: "A captivating story and fantastic atmosphere combine with immersive graphics, natural environments, and a calming, ambient soundtrack to make it a journey you may not soon forget."\n\nThere's a problem with each individual element of that sentence.\n\n1) The story wasn't captivating to me. I wasn't gripping the edge of my seat, straining to hear the next little tidbit of the narrative. To be captivated by it would be a very long stretch. I won't spoil what it's about, but the story asks several questions that either have no answer or can't be answered. These elements of the story discuss mortality, life itself, creation, greed, and so forth. Some of these stories were poetic, while others were along the lines of fairy tales. The questions asked should be the questions we've all asked ourselves before, and while I listened to the narritive, it was more like listening to some gradeschool journal of an inquiring child..... or was that the point? I mean the perspective is that of a young girl, so maybe that was entirely it, but I just couldn't be captivated by asking the cliche 'thoughtful digital novel' question of "what is life?"\n\n2) The fantastic atmosphere and immersive graphics aren't fantastic or immersive. I played on the maximum settings with ease, and yet was unimpressed by it. The entire game seemed like a play-test for the Unreal engine. The collision detection was bad, the invisible barriers were bad, the constant lighting glitches were SO bad. I mean there were areas where small lights led the way to points of interest, and these lights would "ghost" across the screen when you move the mouse around. Even the in-game text had a shine so reflective, that it caused artifacting on the screen. The folliage and surface objects all looked last-generation, and store-bought with little to no customization. The terrain itself was completely contrived and unrealistic. There was nothing natural about it, really. I mean at least the description could be honest about the environments being something of fantasy rather than saying it's natural. There are even moments when character models make an appearance frozen in time along the path for no reason but to suggest the developer had models on hand from a demo that they put into the game "just because". It was weird. The lighting was what completely destroyed any and all immersion though... the fact that you could jump off a sheer rock face and survive didn't help either.\n\n3) The soundtrack was well-suited, however with a distinct lack of volume control or the ability to disable the music altogether, I felt that it actually removed more of my attention from the surrounding elements and on-going narrative than it helped add to the experience. By the end of the game, I felt I was asking my own questions about life itself... for example: "What would life be like if I were to rip my ears out right now to avoid hearing this music play any longer?" Ok, that's a bit harsh I admit, but the music was overpowering, loud, and indeed atmospheric in a world without atmosphere which made it feel out of place. Softer music? No music? I was internally begging for both.\n\n4) The voice acting is bad. There, I said it. I don't mean to offend anyone, but there's no real way for me to avoid that opinion. I've known a lot of voice actors, and I know how tough it can be, but I felt that the voice was about as far from what I would expect from the dialog as you can get. Maybe it was the accent, the tone, or the way that the sentences were read out with strange pauses and emphasis on what I felt were the wrong words.... but it all sounded like some nursery school teacher is reading a book to children. In a game that is supposed to tug at the meaning of life itself, it's weird to hear it from the perspective of a voice that doesn't sound like it's experienced professional voice acting before. Not to mention the audio quality was off-putting as well with full on lip smacking and that sound your lips make when you open your mouth, loud into the recording. If there was any immersion left to be had, it was removed by having this voice go on through the experience. I hope people can understand my meaning and that I'm not just trying to be rude about it. As I consider it, it would be like using Shrek's voice over Mel Gibson's in braveheart. The voice acting is kind of there, but totally not suited for the genre or outlet.\n\nLastly, was this a memorable game? Probably not for me... I played one of the two paths and nothing about it really makes me want to endure the other path option. Maybe I went into this game with my hopes up too high. I'll take my chances with saying it wasn't for me though I can see how some will probably really enjoy it. I certainly can't recommend to any of my friends that they play this though, and that's me being honest.","February 23","false","2.0"," 44 of 62 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","44","62","4","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/recommended/438340/","lillje","Lilly (✿◠‿◠)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/","2609 products in account","Being a "walking simulator", Drizzlepath: Genie's gameplay is very simplistic. There is almost no action to be performed apart from some jumps, pulling a lever and stepping on a platform. However, the whole gaming experience comes from admiring the beauty of the scenery while walking down along a path in the mountains and listening to the narrator's voice. The visual and auditive stimuli are very well balanced in Drizzlepath: Genie, successfully inducing in the player a state of deep relaxation and introversion - which in my opinion is the essence of this genre.\n\nReminiscent of the symbolism of the red/blue pill of the movie The Matrix (like my boyfriend cleverly noticed), the protagonist Lula has to make a choice between journeying on the red path or the blue path. The red path, which is the shorter of the two, will lead her to embracing the painful truth of reality - of who she is and what the purpose of the journey was; on the other hand, the blue path, which is supposed to let the protagonist remain in her own fabricated reality will leave the end entirely to the player's interpretation.\n\nWhile walking down the path, the narrator will provide various texts - ranging from words of wisdom, memories, little stories or anecdotes to abstract snippets rich in philosophical metaphors. While I largely enjoyed reading the texts from the first categories, the latter were almost incomprehensible for me and felt like random words glued together without conveying any palpable meaning. That's unsurprising, considering that I am not endowed with a poetic soul; though I am pretty sure that the fans of this aesthetic genre would enjoy them. The ability to toggle the subtitles on of course helps understanding the narration, however I found myself desperately wanting a button that allowed me to scroll up and read those abstract snippets again, in an effort of apprehending them.\n\nHowever, what really "spoke" to me was the music that follows you almost all the time, a soothing, relaxing music, sometimes emotional, other times mysterious, always changing according to the scenery; the sound of the rain and thunder, the sound of the wind whooshing when you're on a high peak of a mountain.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=638535357\n\nThe landscape is simply beautiful and stunning. You will often find yourself deviating from the straightforward path for the purpose of taking a screenshot of a valley from up above the mountain. The path is most of the times rather narrow and doesn't leave much space for exploration around it, but it will lead sooner or later to openings from which you can admire a breathtaking view of the entire world, triggering in you a very palpable feeling of expansion, just like a walk through the mountains in reality would do.\n\nIn comparison to the first Drizzlepath game, the graphics are considerably superior, the game now using the Unreal 4 engine (as compared to CryENGINE from the first game). There is a noticeable increased attention to the detail - the mountains are now covered with snow, the flowers and trees come in many shapes and forms, the drops of rain sparkle on the rocks in the light of the sun etc - in one word, the textures are much more complex.\n\nOn the other hand, both Drizzlepath: Genie or Drizzlepath could use some adjustments and improvements in configuring their engines. While Drizzlepath completely crashed my PC because of GPU overheating while playing on highest settings (my PC is not optimized for high-tier graphics but it's still a decent gaming PC), Drizzlepath: Genie was much more forgiving in that regard, resulting only in some frame drops and a blurred motion while turning the camera - nothing that I couldn't fix by lowering a bit the quality of the shadows which seem to be very resource-consuming.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=638535402\n\nIn conclusion, Drizzlepath: Genie is a very relaxing experience and one of the good games of its genre. Would I recommend it? Yes! For the beauty of the scenery, for the boundless world, for the calming music combined with the narration, for the quite lengthy gameplay that it offers (2-4h for the red path, 3-5h for the blue path), I consider the price to be very affordable. Note though that in order to enjoy all of these, you must come equipped with quite a good gaming PC, since the graphic requirements are quite high (make sure to check the recommended specs before buying it).\n\nNote: A key has been provided by the developers with the request to write an informative review. No other consideration, compensation or instruction was received. My personal opinions about this game are not influenced by this.\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","March 6","true","10.2"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","1"

Will it be the agony of choice or more the choice of agony?Hint: At the end of this review you will find a TL;DR and a video section.\n\nNote: This review is based on a key provided by the developer. However, this does not change the view on the game.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ REVIEW]▬▬▬▬●\nDrizzlepath: Genie is the follow-up to Tonguc Bodur's first game called Drizzlepath. It is based on the Unreal 4 Engine and released in February 2016. In the tried and tested way of a walking simulator the player explores an island while listening to two different stories, depending on which way was chosen at the beginning.\n\nWe slip into the role of a young girl named Lula, who is on her journey to find out the meaning of life and fate of hers as well as that of her loved ones. A relic called "Genie" will help her, but at that point noone knows who or what this Genie could be. On her travel she comes across a fork from which she is able to choose: one road will show off the harsh bitterness the other one the innocent view of life. At the end of each something special will await Lula, maybe something neither she nor the player would have expected?\n\nCompared to its predecessor, Drizzlepath: Genie is now based on the Unreal 4 Engine, what becomes very noticeable graphicwise. The textures are not so smoothed and detailed anymore as they were in the CryEngine based Drizzlepath 1. This would not be a bigger deal if the game itself would run at least smooth, which is sadly not the case in Drizzlepath: Genie. A look at the current system requirements shows off the expensive ressource usage for which the graphics are not satisfying enough. Thus, older PCs will have problems to run this game correctly on higher graphic options and higher resolutions likewise.\nBoth paths themselves have a resonable length but less landmarks to report. This is not particularly bad, since the player might feel pleased with everything new he encounters on the otherwise very calm path. The purpose of walking simulators is of course, to relax and let the mind fall, but when nothing happens during the long way, that could catch the interest, the first planned purpose changes into boreness rapidly and the player does not mind to keep playing forward. Nevertheless, the overall scenery is harmonious on both paths and will surprise for two playthroughs with a new and different feeling, mostly fitting to the told story.\n\nAs already mentioned both paths contain different stories and with that different endings. After a while the story-teller uncovers more of the thoughts and feelings from the protagonist Lula, so the game won't let the player stumble in the dark. Even when the story itself can get confusing from time to time, caused from the sudden jumps, it is nice to listen to and to come up with own ideas and thoughts about the whole situation. Yet, it is not necessary to follow the story, leaning back and listen to own music can be an option as well. Worth to mention are also the amazing soundtracks within the game, for which both Drizzlepath games should be loved the most.\n\nThe controls are again as smooth as expected from a game of this genre, including the controller support. Unlike Drizzlepath 1 the player has now a few more options to change the graphics as well as enable subtitles in different languages, a great improvement and a nice-to-have.\n\nTo sum everything up: The performance could be a lot better compared with its graphical appearance, but with the knowledge that the game is developed by only one person, Drizzlepath: Genie can be a great experience for hardcorelovers of this genre. Casual gamers maybe enjoy the game for a little while but also move on with another game shortly after. Caused from the repetitive surroundings, the lack of events and fauna the game gets boring fast, so that the great idea in general can't compensate the problems Drizzlepath: Genie suffers from.\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ RÉSUMÉ]▬▬▬▬●\nAfter playing the previous game I had probably too high expectations on what could stay behind it. The option to choose between two paths was admittedly a great idea that increases the replay-value a lot, yet I wished there would happen more on the island. On my walkthrough I encountered a vast number of trees, which looked more or less the same and after a while I missed wildlife like, for example, some deers running across my path, bunnies or anything like that what could catch my interest. The island itself does not give the feeling to be alive, maybe on purpose but also it is no compensation to the monotonously ways I had to walk. Unfortunatly, Drizzlepath: Genie bored me more than it excited me and after 3 hours, the red path finished - the blue path not even half, I had to leave this game for what it was.\n\nMaybe the cutdown to Unreal 4 Engine was not healthy for this follow-up, but beside it there is also an absolute necessity to fix the performance issues.\n\nI would probably recommend it to lovers of this genre who want to have the free option to choose between two stories in a unique world. Casual gamers and those who seek for action or at least for some interesting events should stay away from it.\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ UPDATES]▬▬▬▬●\nAt the 29th of February 2016 Drizzlepath: Genie got an update with some minor fixes and a new filter called "Gothic mode", which turns the world into black and white.\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ TL;DR]▬▬▬▬●\n[✔] Interesting idea behind two different paths/stories\n[✔] Landscape looks overall matching\n[✔] Great soundtracks\n[✔] Smooth controls\n\n[✖] Downgrade to Unreal 4 Engine\n[✖] Too high ressource usage for less graphical value, strong pc build required\n[✖] Muddy textures and an unfavourable overlay effect (chromatic abberation)\n[✖] Story can get confusing from time to time\n[✖] Nothing much happens, island feels more or less dead\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ MEDIA]▬▬▬▬▬●\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR8TlhnY7EE\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=634087810\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked this review and want to see more from me, give this review a thumbs up!

All you do is walk while hearing a story.\n\nThe good:\nThe atmosphere is great! The game is created with the CryEngine which really shows. On your journey you'll see huge areas rich with detail. The rain, the grass moving in the wind, the various flowers - the all add to the beautiful scenery.\nThrough your jouney you'll visit different places such as flowery fields, snowy mountains, and caves.\nIf you like taking screenshots of beautiful places, this is a good game for it.\nFrom time to time a narrator tells a story with a calm voice which adds to the whole experience. The story is quite poetic.\n\n\nThe bad:\nYou walk very slow. I would really liked an option to walk faster. When I wanted to close a bit closer on the scenery I just stopped.\nYou follow a path on your journey but I still felt lost a few times. Some times there's a long period without any narration which can be a bit confusing (at least it was for me in the beginning). At one point the narrator said I was walking the wrong way but I'm pretty sure I didn't.\nVery few times you'll find a small puzzle or some rocks you have to jump over - these seemed out of place compared to the rest of the experience.\n\n\nOverall, if you are into walking simulators and looking at beautiful scenery, this is a good game. If you are looking for a bit more action or involvement, stay away from this game.\n\n\nDisclaimer: a key was provided by the developer in return for an unbiased review.","March 12","true","9.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/recommended/438340/","bodomi","Bodomi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bodomi/","1290 products in account","Let me start this review off with saying, I've played my fair share of Walking Simulators, I've played a lot of the games that are very often referred  to as "Not really a game", I know what they consist of, I know what to expect, I accept the fact that they contain little to sometimes zero actual content or interaction. I enjoy most of them.\n\nBut this game? This game does not speak to me positively in  almost  any way. It's so boring, there is literally 0 content. There is no interactivity, only automatically triggered events, it is literally a simulator where you walk through a path for 2 hours doing nothing but pressing W, A, S and D. There actually is a button to interact with things, E, but you use it once, you can only use it once in the entire game, you can only interact with 1 thing in the entire game, which is walking to a lever and pressing E.\n\nThe game is indeed beautiful, nice graphics as always with the Unreal Engine. But the performance of the game is horrid, I have a fairly strong computer, I had horrible FPS(jumping from 20 to 50) at all graphic sliders at medium or less, I even had Shadows at OFF. So to get the best FPS I had to put everything at the lowest setting and view distance at 20. I still had horrible FPS by the way.\nThat destroyed the experience for me in a great way, one of the things I heavily seek in games like this one is the beauty of the game, I enjoy the artwork. I couldn't with this game due to the bad performance.\n\nI have no positive things to say about the voice acting, it was cringeworthy to listen to, it was to obvious that the voice actor was reading a script on a piece of paper, I didn't get a sense of any personality, it was blank, you can even hear the voice actor stumble in some sentences, you know, when you stop and start over again and delete that recording, but no, it was included in the game when the voice actor messed up a bit, when they stopped for half a second to start a word over again, it was all left in the game.\n\nThe game is relaxing though, if you experience ASMR you will most likely experience it here. The rain is nice to listen to, the thunder is nice to listen to, the talking is nice to listen to as white noise while you're reading something on your 2nd monitor while auto walking.\n\nNo key rebinding, so that's obviously a huge negative. The graphic sliders are not descriptive, it's just Low, Medium, High or, get ready, EPIC! Yea, um, I wan't to know what kind of Anti-Aliasing it is, High AA means nothing, tell me what kind of AA it is.\n\nI have to say though, the first path I took(Red) did keep me interested for about an hour but then I dropped of after that, it was to repetitive, there was literally nothing to do other than pressing W, listening to horrible voice acting and a meaningless story while taking screenshots.\n\nPros:\nGood looking world.\nEasy game to get 100% achievements in.\n\nCons:\nBad voice acting, 0 character.\nBad story, you can't relate to anything.\nHorrible performance, even at the worst possible settings.\nLiterally no content or interactivity.\nExtremely repetitive, have fun doing both the paths, I hope you have 2 monitors to do something else while you auto-walk.\nNot worth the price, this game should be free to play or one of those horrible games, which it is, that is priced at 20 cents.\n\n\nI do not recommend this game to anyone, only reason to get this is if you're a person that likes to get 100% achievements in games, this one is an easy target. Other than that, don't buy it.\n\n2/10. Giving it 2 due to the fact that it's a half decent world to look at.","March 25","false","5.6"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","16","22","2","0"

Drizzlepath: Genie is a game where you are playing as Lula, girl from a village that lived quite a normal life until a wizard appeared in her dreams and told her to find a Genie. As you walk and explore one of the paths you have choosen, you have the opportunity to listen to an amazing story and be part of a mysterious adventure.\n\nAdvantages\nStory is really beautiful, written almost like a poem. It tells a tale of a girl we are playing as, of her past and past of people he knew. Every aspect of it is connected and concisely written\nAll I have to say about graphics is that they are gorgeous, developer did a great job with it. Everywhere you look, you see beautiful views, almost untouched by a human hand\nSounds were realistic and clean, music was stunningly climatic and always on point. Together they built such an unforgettable climate, only for this atmosphere game is worth getting it\nValue of replay is good, 2 different paths to take (didn't finished 2nd one yet) and some secrets to find around. Also for a great views just to go sightseeing again one time\nPrice is really fair for this kind and ammount of content\nNeutrals\nVoicing in this game was good, voice actress have a perfect voice for this game, yet when she tells us story, there is lack of any emotions in her voice\nDisadvantages\nNo in-game audio settings\nLow optimization of graphics\nMusic loops too often, it's really an issue when game is trying to create atmosphere using music and it just cuts off and starts over with same song for next 15 minutes. There is also a little voice recordings issue where you clearly can hear a white noise in background when recording starts and ends\nYou can browse menu only using your mouse, which is really annoying when you play using a gamepad\nModels of characters are poor compared to surroundings (just it as I really don't want to spoil anything)\nSummary\nGame is worth buying if you're looking for an adventure to calm yourself out, just lay back and relax playing something pleasant. Yes, game have some cons but it's mostly technical stuff and doesn't affect gameplay itself, those advantages are taking over them. I was kinda forced to avoid one or two things because it's surprisingly hard not to spoil game. You might not find game attractive if you are not a patient kind of gamer, but I recommend it to every single one of you anyway.\n\nPersonal score8 / 10\nIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!","February 25","true","4.7"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/438340/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","IntroductionIt’s been a while since my last review (apologies!), but I’m here now to tell you a little bit about Drizzlepath Genie, a new game in the genre known as ‘walking simulators’. It looks pretty, that’s for sure, but is there anything underneath all that beauty or is it just style-over-substance? Shall we take a closer look?\n\nGameplayDrizzlepath Genie is one such game with a poetic story. For a walking simulator it has some very strong writing, with deep meaning. I enjoyed it, mostly, but sometimes the sentences seem a little too complex/convoluted making the story hard to understand at times.\n\nUnlike other games in the genre the game offers two paths to take. Both will give you an entirely different experience, with different visuals and different stories. The bad/wrong path is the longest, the good/right path is the shortest. I’m not going to spoil it for you, you’ll have to make the decision yourself, but I (as well as the developer) encourage to play through both stories. I think that each path offers roughly 97% unique dialog, and one of the paths is about twice as long as the other.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=633038628\nWhile walking a female narrator (who is also your character) will tell you some stories. The stories start off a bit boring and at the start you have no idea what to expect so I guess this only makes sense. Later on the overarching story becomes more interesting and near the end of my first playthrough (bad path) I learned to appreciate it even more. But it’s a slow story, with a lot of padding, especially if you take the bad path. I later noticed that the good path is more evenly paced and for most people it will be the better and more enjoyable path to take, but in general it feels like there are a lot of unnecessary detours.\nAlso, it seemed odd to me that she would tell a short story only to tell it to me in parts, with minutes in between. I would’ve rather heard her tell the entire story, and then at a later time begin a completely new one. I consider this also a part of the pacing issues the game has.\n\nThe paths you take are rather linear and while you can explore a little, it’s not encouraged except for just a few times (if you see red/blue magic (fireflies?), for example, and floating verses/poems). But these distractions are hardly interesting for most people. They can’t be interacted with, you see. Plus, the fact that the game has some collision detection issues makes exploring rarely fun or worth your time.\n\nAs for the controls: these are quite simple, as expected. With the WASD keys you move around, with the mouse you control the camera, with E you interact and with Q you can auto-walk (which is brilliant if you’re lazy or, like me, have to take notes for your review). And there’s a zoom function that, to me, serves no real purpose.\nThe auto-walk button made me appreciate the environments more, though and I hope to see this function in more walking simulators from now on. But let’s face it; it will always remain a rather passive experience, even if you don’t use this specific button.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=632835107\nAs for improvements… One thing that would make the game instantly more enjoyable would be to either implement a run button (which you’re already basically doing if I’m not mistaken, but it still feels like walking) or just increase the walking speed. Yes, it would decrease the game’s length but I think more people would enjoy it as most of us play the game for the story and not necessarily the walking part itself. It would definitely work for the bad path (considering the padding issues), but I’m not entirely sure how and if it would work for the good path. Despite that I think it’s still worth looking into.\n\nAudio & VisualsI have absolutely no complaints about the audio. The voice acting is mostly solid, but I wish it sometimes had a tad more emotion.\nThe music itself is quite minimalist. Occasionally you’ll hear a few tracks, most of it piano music and/or string instruments, but other than that you’ll be listening to ambient sounds like thunder and rain falling down. It’s very calm and soothing and in this case it fits both the genre and the story.\n\nVisually the game is pretty, but it has some pretty flat lighting. Fortunately, this can be solved by using ENB profiles (or other similar alternatives).\nYou’ll be walking across seemingly infinite forests, caves and mountains and while there’s little variety in the 4-5 hours you’ll be playing it it’s still nice to look at.\nThe performance is okay-ish, with framerates fluctuating between 40-60+FPS on my system (if you’re interested in my specs please visit my profile). I don’t think it will bother anyone since the game doesn’t rely on fast (action) scenes.\nOverall it’s a very pleasing game to look at.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=632835136\nLength/Replay ValueA playthrough can take anywhere between 1,5-3 hours and then you can play it again, taking a different path that tells you a different side of the same story and one that will also have some different art. Nothing major, though; if you’ve played through it once then you’ll have seen most of it. All in all it can take up to 4,5-6 hours before you’ll be completely done with it.\n\nConclusionDrizzlepath Genie starts off rather slow, and has a lot of padding in it (specifically in the bad path), but it fortunately picks up near the end of the story, about 2/3th in. It might not be a game for anyone: there’s lot of complex, poetic writing in it and if you’re not a native English speaker you might have a little trouble understanding it all and making sense of it. You naturally also have to like or be interested in walking simulators.\nKeep in mind that there’s very little interactivity – with this I mean that you might feel you’re not truly playing a game - so you can expect a lot of listening/reading and walking (and a little bit of (frustrating) jumping).\n\nIf it was a little more concise this probably would’ve been a no-brainer. It will still be for fans of the genre I expect. For everyone else the game will probably be too slowly paced, which might make the entire experience feel unrewarding or dull at times. But if you ever have some spare money laying around it’s still worth a try, if only for the excellent writing and deeper-than-expected story.\n\nToo long, didn’t readPros:\n+ Strong writing with quite a decent story\n+ Voice acting is also quite good\n+ Could use some extra shading but overall it has pretty graphics\n+ Two different paths to play\n\nMixed:\n+/- Story starts off slow, but ultimately picks up\n+/- The slow pacing in general might turn people off\n+/- Repetitive environments, but fortunately, it mixes things up about halfway through\n\nCons:\n- Might feel a little too poetic/cryptic for some\n- The world feels and mostly is completely empty (although this might be intentional, I’m not quite sure yet)\n- Can feel very passive at times\n- Some performance and collision detection issues\n\nPlease note: a Steam key for this game was provided by the developer/publisher.\nRating: 6.7 (out of 10)(Ratings aren’t calculated based on a formula, but on my personal feelings)\n\n\nIf you have any kind of feedback - positive or negative - please feel free to leave a comment (in case of negative feedback please try to keep it constructive).

Recommended for fans of the genre\n\nA walking simulator is a type of video game which lacks many of the traditional aspects of a game (such as a goal, win/loss conditions, any kind of game system to interact with) despite taking the form of a video game. The phrase implies that there is basically nothing to do in the game other than walking around.\n\nIt is a very basic but good definition what to expect if you play a walking simulator. It is important to note that this genre is not for everyone. It is a mere niche in gaming. If you do not enjoy the fact of just walking around on a very linear way, this game might not be for you. But if you like very basic, but easy controls and to have a clear purpose, which means to get from point a to b. Why not to give this game a chance.\n\nGreat atmosphere with some major gameplay and performance problems\n\nThe game has some good atmosphere with a great soundtrack and a cute voice-acting which is comprehensible. It is though difficult to overall follow the story. To really understand what it is all about. This could have been done more clearly. I am also not very happy with the performance as I see even on my Titan X some weird stuttering when I turn for example around. Some gameplay glitches made me start the game twice – when leaving the prescribed path I was falling in a trench and could not get out of it.\n\nYou might get some nice screenshots out of this game. But can this be the only purpose of the whole game? I am not sure. Overall there could have been more landmarks and more events, some fauna, some animals. I am missing some more wow-effects. This was better in the previous Drizzlepath.\n\nShould I buy it?\n\nI like the genre and I am happy about every game that we get for it. I will recommend this game to gamer that like very slow paced games or look for some handy screenshot opportunities. Gamer that do not like to hassle too much. I will also recommend this game for everyone that is a hardcore walking simulator fan. That’s for sure.\n\nFor the casual gamer that looks for an interesting story and some more action orientated gaming experience, I can unfortunately not recommend this game.\n\nThe overall idea of the Drizzlepath series is great and I am happy to see more in the future. This time with a more captive storyline and more interaction. Why not implement some more little events during the long path to the top of the mountain?!\n\nVR & 3D VISION\n\nAnd my last point concerns Nvidia 3D Vision and VR gaming in general. This game could actually win a lot by implementing 3D vision in a native way – the engine allows it. And also with regards to VR gaming in the coming month, I see a lot of potential for games like Drizzlepath, in order to convince a whole new customer base - that might never have played PC games - which is looking for some simple virtual walking possibility.\n\nPositive\n\nGreat soundtrack and lovely voice-acting\nThe game has a good atmosphere and a relaxing colour-scheme\nSome nice colourful graphic effects (idea of red and blue)\nPossibility to take your time to take pictures\nTwo different paths\nEasy to learn controls with auto-walk option\nSteam achievements & cards\nNegative\n\nIt is difficult to follow the storyline\nShort in general and some of the walking feels very repetitive\nChromatic aberration and some other blurry effects are annoying\nPerformance is not optimized, micro-stutters\nThe amount of landmarks and events is not satisfying\nLimited replay value\nNo native 3D Vision","February 28","true","2.8"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/faedine/recommended/438340/","faedine","FaeDine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/faedine/","3742 products in account","tl;dr - Ultimately, you're not buying a game but an experience. You're playing a character on a beautiful hike and listening to their introspective internal monologue. If that appeals to you, you'll probably like Drizzlepath: Genie. If it doesn't, you should give the game a pass.\nDrizzlepath: Genie does some things right though does have a few caveats that will deter some players. I'll start with a simple pros and cons list.\nProsGreat visuals and a beautifully crafted landscape\nDecent voice acting and great vignettes\nInteresting storyConsBugs when exploring (can get stuck and need to restart)NeutralEasy achievements\nCards\nToo much walking at times and very little 'game'\nWorld can feel very lonely and staticTo expand on these a bit... the world itself is lovingly crafted and looks beautiful and can make for some fantastic screenshots.\n\nThe voice acting (one character, just the protagonist) is for the most part quite good. Sometimes the script gets a bit scholarly and it can feel a bit drab, but any lines with emotion come off well.\n\nThe story isn't perfect, and it took me two playthroughs (needed if you want to genuinely complete the game) to really appreciate it. I felt a bit underwhelmed by, and it can be a bit jarring at first, but that just may be that the hints along the way are very subtle and easy to miss. The vignettes and still images that help the story along are pleasant.\n\nThe game is tagged as a "Walking Simulator" and that's a pretty accurate description. There's not very much "game" here. There are a few jumping challenges, a few very basic puzzles, but it's for the most part just a lot of walking. I don't see this as necessarily a pro or con depending on who you are, but it's good to be aware of it going in.\n\nThe game encourages you to explore by making things off in the distance intriguing and piquing your curiosity. Unfortunately, the game can unintentionally penalize you by having a few areas where you can get stuck. There are invisible walls keeping you safe from most cliffs. This can be really frustrating, and if you've just recently loaded a save and don't have a checkpoint, you'll need to restart the whole game. I'm hoping the dev can fix this and include more frequent checkpoints and have them active even when loading a save.\n\nThe world can feel quite barren, though this feels deliberate in the sense that the plot relies on it. But I would have really loved to see some deer or squirrels or something other than trees or mountains in the distance.\n\nI left thinking it was a bit of a mixed experience.\n\nFull disclosure - I received a free copy of the game from the developer for review purposes.","March 10","true","7.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

Gameplay is overall relaxing, aside from some "challenging jump sequences".\n\nYou can save and quit at any time. The vast game world provides alternative locations, away from the main path, to explore. There you will find additional, story related information. The story itself is dealing with the question, what is the Genie? At the beginning, it's up to you to decide which path (out of two) you choose. Without knowing the outcome of your decision. The chase is on.\n\nSo if you are fine with just exploring and enjoying the beautiful word of Drizzlepath, it's a clear must have.\n","February 28","true","10.2"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","1"

The game is very relaxing and music is great.  Just got rather annoying since I had no idea what the game was about, lol. But thats my fault.  I found myself getting frustrated waiting for the action to start, but at the same time I was going farther into the game and began to want to know what the Genie was.  Negative aspect is really just my thinking it was a different style of game, so I cant knock game for that.  But I thumbed it up cause it took my frustration and still made me curious to see what would happen towards the end.","February 25","true","3.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Don't walk the Drizzlepath looking for challenging opponents or difficult puzzles. You won't find any of that here; in fact, there's only a couple of actual interactions with the environment in the whole game!\n\nWhat you will find are incredible vistas, intriguing landscapes, and bunches of weird little "easter eggs" hidden here and there, all accompanied by lovely and literate poetry revealing the inner thoughts and memories of the game's main character, Lula, a village girl tasked with finding a mysterious "genie." There are two pathways to explore, each with its own ending, but venturing off of the path will yield some surprising and even seemingly incongruous finds: hidden objects, and even people! It's a virtual sightseeing tour, through the eyes of a young poet.\n\nIf you're in a hurry to get somewhere or to find answers, you may find the lengthy journey (five hours or so, if you walk the path at top speed and don't stop to smell the roses) a bit tedious. If, on the other hand, you like to see beautifully-rendered scenery and explore unusual and imaginative terrain at a relaxed pace--without anything jumping out to kill you--then Drizzlepath: Genie might just suit you.","February 28","true","7.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The story, and I use the term INCREDIBLY loosely (even by walking sim standards), would struggle to be called threadbare. The voiceover is painfully stilted at best. And the world has nothing in it to engage with.\n\nI'm sure it's got an audience, but that audience is not me.","February 28","false","1.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I love games where you explore abandoned worlds, but I want to explore, and have interaction with the world.\n\nHowever, this game was not that.  This game was interminable (even the short path).  To make matters worse the voice acting was horrible.  The narrator speaks in a never-ending droning voice which made me want to walk off the nearest cliff and end it all.  At one point in speaking of a childhood friend, the narrator speaks of "sweetly suffering his platitudes."  If suffer she did, she decided thereafter to inflict those same platitudes on everyone else, or at least all the players of this game.  The game strikes me as being written by developpers who did not have the creativity or imagination to create a truly interactive world.  Or even a slowly evolving story that you discover for yourself.  Exploration adds nothing to the storyline, and the storyline is like a badly written scifi.\n\nPros: really can't think of any big ones.  The scenery is pretty, but it's pretty monotonous aftter a while.  Graphics are okay, but not nice enough to make the journey worthwhile.\n\nCons:\nbad voice acting\nuninteresting story\nso-so graphics\nno true exploration, or interaction with the world (there is an interaction key, don't be fooled you use it ONCE).\nSince the graphics, story and voice acting are all you get, they should be stunning, but they are not.\n","April 3","false","9.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

And it's pretty enough to be nice to look at and screenshot.\nI got 5/6 hours out of it, completing both paths and the achievements were nicely done and 100%able within that time period.\nUnfortunately within a few minutes of the game I cringed at the singular voice of the protagonist. This innocent voice that is meant to be so articulate and emotive, sounds like a young girl reading poetry she doesn't really understand to the teacher in school. It constantly dragged me out of the world, and actually irritated me quite alot. Such a shame.","April 18","false","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
