Unfortunately this has marred what is now quite literaly a brilliant sim. Its taken a while (2 years actually) but for those of us who gave this sim a second chance we have not been disappointed. For that reason I feel that I should make people aware of what they are missing if they don't get this game, but don't take my word for it..checkout the recent youtube videos..\n\nThe online experience is probably the best part of this game...To fight in the skies over Kent and the Pas-de-Calais in real time, scan the skies for enemy contacts, wing with a buddy and engage a deadly foe, it is exhilarating. You can change your shells to whatever shells were available at the time, you can change convergence settings so that your bullets hit exactly the same point, you fuel up to what amount you need which will influence your aircrafts balance and weight. The dogfight tactics are still the same from 1940, the flight characteristics are different for each aircraft and at different altitudes too....You can also fly bomber runs in 1940 bombers and take control of every manned gunning position as you try to fend off hungry attackers.\n\nEven for new players there is plenty of help on youtube with 5 minute startup procedures, and how to dogfight in every flyable aircraft, you can be up and flying in just a few minutes. The best online server is ATAGS and they also have a website (link at bottom of this review)to checkout which is a must for new flyers with questions. Most importantly a large group of WWII aircraft enthusiast program techs have taken this sim and are constantly modifying it for a more complete experience. They are called the Team Fusion (TF) and they also use the ATAGS website as their base for discussion. The issues that once surrounded this game have now been resolved and the TF are now dedicating their time to making game enhancing changes like contrails and reflective cockpit canopys. Thats where this sim is at now.\n\nIf you want to fly online with us (and I would highly recommend the dogfighting online as its so much more full on than offline)...you must install the patches that can be found on the ATAGS website..and also for any questions...link to website here:\n\nhttp://theairtacticalassaultgroup.com/forum/forum.php\n\nSo my advice is to ignore any review earlier than 2013 as Cliffs Of Dover is as different now to when it was released as night and day and is nowhere near comparable with those early reviews.\n","February 1, 2014","true","749.6"," 114 of 119 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","114","119","0","4"

So if you're you'll see this as one of the latest and most up-to-date reviews?\n\nFirstly a little about me. My username is Mysticpuma and I am one of the team of modders who go by the name "Team Fusion".\n\nSince the simulation was abandoned by the developers (in a pretty bugged state) our modding group of community members, all flight-sim enthusiasts, have been fixing, patching and adding to the simulation COMPLETELY FOR FREE so that players will get to experience the true version of the software that should have been released.\n\nIL2: Cliffs of Dover is a masterpeice in the flightsim genre BUT due to financial constraints was released in a working but bugged condition. Since that release there were two official updates from the developers (applied automatically when installed using Steam) and these fixed a host of issue....but not all!\n\nAs I mentioned before, Team Fusion are all members (unpaid) of the Flight Sim community who have given 1000's if not 100's of 1000's of hours of their time so that the Simulation becomes one of, if not the, ultimate WW2 Combat Flight Sim.\n\nThe detail that has been created, improved, fixed, upgraded has been vast and this also includes multi-player netcode, now allowing huge online battles to take place.\n\nOur team are currently working on completely new aircraft, completely new flyable aircraft (and variants of existing), shipping, vehicles, mission builder objects, effects, sound, new map(s), a new map tool builder and much, much more........and will be given to the community COMPLETELY FOR FREE!!! No paid expansion, no micro in-game charges, the patches, fixes and updates are FREE!! All made by community members for community members.\n\nWhilst I could sit and type for hours about the changes and fixes here are just a few features and video links that should give an idea of the level of depth Team Fusion have and are going to in an effort to give you the Flight Sim enthusiast, the best experience possible:\n\nFirstly a link to our videos on the VImeo page (we have now moved to Youtube). These should give you an idea of the level of detail in the software, what has been updated and where we are heading:\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/teamfusion/videos\n\nNext our Youtube Channel:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/TeamFusionMod/videos\n\n\nIf you don't have time to scour through all the video here are links to 3-4 highligh clips:\n\nA Taste of Fusion. This video clip gives an oversight of the history of the software and what happened since it's release (don't worry....it's not a documentary!) :\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/88650686\n\nSome of the effects work:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf4zV2gWL-c\n\nand this one:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBxOQe99Vv8\n\nNew ships (and features):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58dq-Hpye1A\n\nNew aircraft:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzymlVgixcU\n\n\nIn finishing I'll just say that hopefully this information is of use to you. Yes the sim was abandoned due to financial constraints....but for just a tenner, once you apply the Team Fusion (FREE, did I mention FREE?) patches the software is completely playable on Windows 7 (64-bit) upwards including Windows 10. It has a thousands of new features, fixes, effects, etc, etc and we are also (and have a working version) looking to utilise Oculus Rift support after upgrading the software to use DirectX 11.\n\nAND IT'S FREE!!!!!!\n\nFor more news and updates the best place to visit is the ATAG Server where Team Fusion are based and can be found here:\n\nhttp://theairtacticalassaultgroup.com/forum/\n\nThe Team Fusion Facebook page is here:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/teamfusionmod\n\nThere are also some other great servers and forums out there including the Air Combat Group and Storm of War and these use this software with the Team Fusion patches and regluarly have hundreds of online players taking part:\n\nhttp://aircombatgroup.co.uk/forum/index.php\n\nhttp://www.stormofwar.org/phpBB3/\n\nIf you take the time to go through the videos and visit the forums linked to you'll see the software is far from abandoned, it is true to say that the 'Vanilla' version is bugged (but not unplayable, just frustrating), BUT, by downloading the FREE Team Fusion patches, you will have access to one of the best WW2 Combat Flight Sims available and that is still be worked on, updated, having new maps and features added......AND ALL FOR FREE.\n\nTeam Fusion are made up of our community and are building and creating this for our community.\n\nCheers, Mysticpuma\n\n\n","February 26","true","159.4"," 93 of 98 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","93","98","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/venturi_effect/recommended/63950/","venturi_effect","Venturi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/venturi_effect/","36 products in account","Cliffs of Dover is an excellent World War 2 flight simulator, recreating what it is like to be a British or German combat pilot during the Summer of 1940. HOWEVER, it is excellent only if you use the Team Fusion patch. Let me make that clear. Cliffs of Dover should have been an excellent product from the first. Its vision and the designed scope of improvement over other WW2 flight sims was, and still is, truly next generation. However, the sim was a commercial flop - for a variety of reasons.\n\nMore than anything, the effect its release had on the flight simming community was to generate at first epic anger, and later, epic sighs of disapointment. We all had high hopes, but they were decisively dashed after the initial boot-up of what has become known as IL-2 CloD. Frame rates when the sim was first released were slide-show poor, stability was enough to make Job tear his hair, and menu navigation was inexplicably difficult. These and a myriad of other major issues kept anyone from feeling they got their money's worth. Most who had purchased Cliffs of Dover, eagerly expecting the best WW2 sim experience possible, quickly shelved it after vigorously (and justly) lambasting the developers online. The issues with which this product first shipped are unacceptable for any entertainment product if it is going to succeed. And, therefore due to the quality, or lack of it, succeed IL-2 Cliffs of Dover did not. The vision was there, the scope was there, the basics were there - but the execution left all the positives absolutely irrelevant.\n\nNow fast forward in time to the present. Over the years since release, a series of patches from the developers have addressed many issues in the software, partly to silence their critics, but also in an effort to salvage their reputation for further software development. The most recent developer's patch, however, came with a statement: No More Work Will Be Done. Although the official patches fixed many issues, serious flaws still remained unaddressed. Seeing that CloD had been abandoned by the developers, a small group of historically-minded flight sim enthusiasts took it upon themselves to fix the glitches that remain, adding content as well as restored functionality. The result has been, literally, a game-changer. Frame rates are at 60FPS on modern machines, flight modeling is impressive, software stability is great, and the single player campaigns have even been re-written. Multiplayer is fantastic. 50 to 100 human pilots routinely fly together, in one server, over the English channel and French and English countrysides, re-enacting the dramatic days before, during, and after the Battle of Britain. You can find your aerial combat fix nearly any day or night on the ATAG (TF) multiplayer server. Team Fusion continues to poll the community for needed changes, and to add more content and bugfixes regularly. Their forum, and their patches, can be found at: http://theairtacticalassaultgroup.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=91\n\nI highly recommend IL-2 CloD if you are a serious WW2 flight sim enthusiast. To date, it has the highest degree of period engine and flight modelling that a complete WW2 flight simulation product  has delivered. You will feel as if you are piloting a piston-powered, 1200 horsepower, state of the art (for 1940) aircraft into realistic and deadly combat using nothing but a compass, high-power guns, crosshairs gunsight, and your wits. It is not an easy sim. It is a realistic one. If that is what you want, you have found it. Just make sure you use the TF additions. -Venturi","July 2, 2014","true","415.1"," 81 of 82 people (99%) found this review helpful","99","81","82","0","0"

The game in itself had some issues that made alot of people put this sim back on the shelve (I almost did as well)  But the community rallied, a mod team was formed under the name Team Fusion and this sim came back to life and went way above and beyond it's expectations.  The realism and immersion are top notch and the community is one of the best in the gaming world and very helpful and patient with newbies.  Even now in early 2014 the game is still being modded by TF and getting better all the time with new content, updated and better fps friendly graphics partical and visual effects.  The flight models and damage models have been revised and more historical and are still getting better with each new patch.  You can now take control of tanks and ground pound (wip) and the next mod release (coming very soon) you will be able to take control of flak guns and defend your base from enemy stafing it.  This game will still be here in ten years no doubt and just keep getting better as it goes.  The ATAG(AIR TACTICAL ASSAULT GROUP) server is the best host for this sim and there are always people on it willing to help newcomers out and get started.   I have over 1200 hous on this awesome sim and will probably get to 10,000 plus in the next 5 to 10 years.   And the best thing is the price is right, for under $20 you can't go wrong.  Although now with the TF mods it sould be worth at least $60 and probably more.  I definitely recommend this sim to any flight enthusiest out there.","February 22, 2014","true","767.0"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","46","51","0","0"

If you like World War 2 history and have an interest in flight simulators, look no further: this is the game you’ve been waiting for. You will relive the Battle of Britain like you have never seen it before. You will find yourself crammed into a claustrophobic cockpit and fight for either the Royal Air Force, the Luftwaffe or the Regia Aeronautica Italiana. If you are an aviation buff, you will be pleased to find an impressive selection of aircraft used during the battle, even less known aircraft like the Boulton-Paul Defiant, the Supermarine Walrus, the Short Sunderland, the Dornier Do-17 or the Vickers Wellington. Of course, not all of these aircraft are flyable yet but the iconic planes like the Spitfire, Bf.109, Hurricane, G.50, Blenheim IV, Ju-88, He-111 and Br.20 can be flown. You can fly online with up to 100 people, which makes for very impressive battles with friends and foes.\n\nThe story of Il-2 Cliffs of Dover is a long and complicated one. When Ubisoft and 1C Game Studios dropped support for the game, a merry band of volunteers decided to create a free mod in order to fix the many issues Cliffs of Dover had back in the years 2011 to 2013. They became known as Team Fusion, and they keep modding CloD to this day and are slowly expanding the game to a whole new level. Sound mods, graphical fixes, performance improvement, flight model adjustment, new flyable aircraft, additional war theaters… these guys transformed this sim from the buggy-and-barely-playable-piece-of-junk mentioned in early reviews to what we have today. The difference between pre-mod and after-mod is mindblowing and it is the only way to play this game, trust me.\n\nThe strength of the game is that it is a happy medium between the complexity of a study sim like DCS and the accessibility of an arcade sim like War Thunder. You can jump into a cockpit and fly like you’re really there. You need to keep your engine temperatures (oil and water radiator) in check by maintaining proper RPM and manifold pressure settings (which are controlled by prop pitch and throttle controls) that should come with any cheap joystick you can buy on the market. Just like in real life, your aircraft will be prone to stall, spin and attempt to kill you if you do certain types of manoeuvers. You will learn how to takeoff and land by maintaining proper rotation and approach speeds. You will also learn how to navigate using either a magnetic compass or a gyro compass, just like they did in the 1940’s. You can also do high-altitude bombing with the real bombsight and autopilot controls if you like more advanced stuff. And if you think this stuff is too hard to learn, have no fear. There will ALWAYS be someone to explain these things to you if you ask for help. How do I know? Well, simply because I gave up on this game three times before Team Fusion finally modded the game and I asked for help on the ATAG forums (more on that later). These guys taught me everything I know and it is my pleasure to train new guys on a regular basis.\n\nCliffs of Dover wouldn’t be where it is today if it wasn’t for the efforts of Team Fusion, but I must also mention something else about CloD. There is a sense of fellowship in its online community that is unique and has no equal anywhere else. ATAG, also known as the Air Tactical Assault Group, is an online community where it all started. ATAG hosts the most popular online server and their forums are THE place to go if you want to learn how to play this game. There is a virtual Flight School where people request lessons with volunteer teachers. People can join Virtual Squadrons, discuss History, create multiplayer events, online campaigns, and have lots of fun on Teamspeak (which is a must if you want to fly online and coordinate with your fellow pilots). Whether you are a flight sim veteran or someone who has never even seen an aircraft, there is always place for you among the skies of Dover. If you like competition, you will find in multiplayer some of the finest virtual pilots with thousands of hours under their belt. If you want to learn how to fly from scratch, you will find someone to teach you the basics, from how to start your engine and get your butt off the ground to advanced techniques on how to shoot down enemy planes in flames. Guaranteed.\n\nOverall, Cliffs of Dover is now living up to its promises and it is a real blast to fly. There is nothing more intense in the history of gaming than trying to shake that Messerschmitt off your six o’ clock. The next Team Fusion patch will include (for free) a new theater, new flyable planes (among them the mighty Wellington bomber) and all sorts of new goodies.\n\nAnd If you don’t believe me, here are some videos of the game in action.\n\nThe Killer Angels\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNBEK49_isc\nThe Beginning of the End\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6u4JxgE2S4\nW for Wimpy – The Vickers Wellington\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMqw4b6HJ3Y\nNo. 71 Squadron Chronicles\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adj4kcbgTkw\nBand of Blennies\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fHIsTyu5Bk","November 28, 2014","true","553.5"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","40","43","0","0"

Now it's on the third version of the patch (4.3) and 5.0 will release this summer, with many new aircraft and a new theatre (most likely a North Africa or Malta theatre)\n\nNew content in the new patch will be:\n\nFlyable aircraft:\n\nBf. 109F\nSpitfire V\nWellington Bomber\nBeaufighter\nBf 108 Trainer\nP-40E\nF4F Martlet/Wildcat\nPerhaps the Gladiator and CR42\nTiger Moth with guns and bombs\n\nOther Content\n\nA new map\nMultiple new ships like RN Battleships HMS Rodney, HMS Warspite, German Schnellboots, British PT boats, (Many with mannable flak guns), new merchant ships, and more.\nTrains with flak guns\nbarges with flak guns\npotential for so many new mission scenarios.\n\nThe multiplayer is outstanding, with servers up to 100 players and special events like the ATAG events and the 401/ATAG "War Machine" persistent campaign which is currently running every Saturday.\n\nOverall, with the TF patches, for $10 this is the best WWII sim you can buy, no contest.\n\n\nATAG website[www.theairtacticalassaultgroup.com]","May 8","true","350.3"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","2"

I really like WWII Fight sims, and I really enjoyed Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 1, especially 2, and sort of 3. Then I found IL-2 1946, and thoroughly enjoyed that as well. So, I'm glad to say this game is pretty great as well.\n\nPlease bear in mind, this is not an action packed game, it's pretty much a sim, which means some aspects of it can be mundane; but if your too broke to actually afford a pilots license, and unable to Uncle Rico your way back in time, then this game will do fine. It's easy to learn, and not nearly as painstakingly thorough at some of the other air combact sims out there (which are fun, but require a lot of time, and aren't exactly jump on when you get off work games).\n\nIf you're using a joystick, you'll need to assign all of the functions, including the X and Y axis. Don't forget to assign a key to the map, or you'll get lost like my dumb ♥♥♥ and get scolded by the AI squad leader in his oh-so polite English accent.\n\nThe flight controls are nice and fluid, they don't snap into dead-zones like some games, and they are quit comunicative if you have a force feedback stick. Even at medium the graphics are good. I still need to learn more about the games options, because in the 'cockpit' some instruments, especially important once like your heading compass are completely blocked by the stick. Again, the gps/map will save your butt. As good as the game is, it still leaves you wanting something more, but for a 4 year old game that's been modded to function much better with really good patches, you can't beat it for the price.

However over time this was patched both officially, and unofficially (through mod projects like Team Fusion[teamfusion.theairtacticalassaultgroup.com]) and this game became actually playable. And it has to be said that for the Battle of Britain Theatre of WW2 specifically you won’t find a better Flight Simulation title as of writing this (it’s a good game to move on to from playing other BOB games which have become graphically dated by now).\n\nIn terms of content, this game comes with several flyable aircraft, about 12 - excluding the vast selection of variants of each of these. There are several more ‘AI’ aircraft included, that you could also make flyable with modifications. The in-game map covers the South Coast of England (up to and including London), the English Channel, and Northern France. On highest graphical settings the game is still nice to look at and immerse yourself in the game-world.\n\nSo if you are interested in WW2 combat in the skies over Britain, and want to fly British, German and Italian aircraft then you should certainly get this title. But I would say really anyone interested in aviation as a whole may like this title as it currently sells for only £9.99 and there’s certainly hours of usage you can get from it - even if this involves solo flight without combat (if combat isn't something you are interested in).\n\nOn a final note I will say this game is unlikely to run at stock without patches and 3rd party Team Fusion mod. This game is compatible with Windows 10 with these mods and patches – but will not run without them from experience.","April 16","true","19.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

(only 2 years after it came out i could play it with the PC i have today).\n\nBecause all of those reasons the public opinion was very negative for this sim, and i assume the sales impacted by that, so, eventually, while the developers worked on the second sim in this new series, the company shut this series down and we left with only the first module. but, IMO, they had to give it a chance, it’s take time for peoples move to a new sim.\nAfter few years they started the current IL-2 Series(BoS), which is, btw, also great.\n\nSo, CloD isn't continuing developed officially, but! fortunately, a modding team called "Team Fusion" continuing to develop this great sim. they already improved the sim very much, and they're still improving the sim, and will add new planes, sounds etc..in the future. so, if you are interested in this sim, those mods are a must. And today, thx to the community, we have many guides and manuals.\n\nAbout the sim itself, IL-2 CloD focus on the Battle of Britain theater, in a very detailed way, the map of the channel is large and pretty. the visuals are good and realistic.for a first sim in a series, there are plenty of flyable planes, fighters and bombers.\n\nThe physics are good, much more detailed and realistic than the original IL-2 Series. you have the feeling of real flying, you can still fly with missing a major part of the wings, aerodynamic forces are modeled very nice, spins and all what we expected from this kind of sims.\n\nThe damage model is also very detailed, the modeling of the construction of the plane is very in depth, the resolution of the hits is great. also, fire model is great, in which, a fire can start at one point in the skin of the plane and it spreads slowly to other areas in the skin of the plane. the systems damage model is also very detailed, almost every sub system can be damaged by many reasons.\n\nThe systems of the planes are modeled very nice, and it’s a clickable cockpit with the mouse. There are a very few minor systems that are not modelled, for instance, the battery which is always on and you cannot control it, but the most systems are modeled, and in a great detail! The plane feels real, the gauges are shaking, the ADI is losing calibration by maneuvers, you can turn on and off the gunsight, you can change the range/target size of the gunsight etc..engine management is great, you can over revving the engine and the engine will damage, off course there is an over heat, under heat etc..\nThe configuration of the weapons and ammo is very detailed, you can choose which guns to put in the planes, convergence, which ammo belts, and even make your personal ammo belts.\n\nThere are many players online, for instance ATAG server is very popular.\n\nthere is some minor graphic downsides, such as the animation of the controls of the planes which aren't smooth, and the mirrors dosen't work, but, those not so a big deal IMO, and i think that working mirrors are on the roadmap of Team Fusion.\n\nFor summary, a great WW2 combat flying sim. IMO, this with DCS and the new IL-2 series are complete each other, and are the best sims for realistic WW2 combat flying sims.","March 23","true","62.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

But to say it hasn't had it's problems would be an understatment. As to why it went south as it was released unfinshed to the public is to speculate all day. But as with many such products that are incomplete or abandoned, the community took up the banner and via Team Fusion (look it up on youtube and Vimeo) CloD has been reserected. It is fun to fly and and gives you the feeling of participating in the Battle of Brittain 1940. I payed the full price off the shelf of $60 dollars and nver regreted it. Still don't as I enjoy it daily. At the present price of under $10, there is no way you can go wrong. Now, with no offense to you who fly War Thunder, this is NOT an arcade game. You will have a learning curve and it will be challenging. So grab you a copy and hop over to the ATAG forums to patch up with the TF patch and enjoy a great flight simulation experience.","November 8, 2014","true","173.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Finding this 2011 release of IL-2 Cliffs of Cover on Steam, I had hoped for a more polished experience, but was left terribly frustrated after hours of simply attempting to get the game to run properly. When a game is made widely available on Steam, from a huge publisher as Ubisoft, I should not be expected to need to manually edit a bunch of .config and .ini text files buried deep within the installation directories just to get it to run! Yes, there is apparently a strong user community whom have created mods and patches to make this a much more playable game, but, again, a full-release paid-for title on Steam should not require any of this. There are early-access and pre-alpha release games that perform and play much more reliably than this. If you're willing to spend hours scraping online forums for user mods, configuration editing instructions and fooling with text-file jibberish, then perhaps you might find some enjoyment with this game. However, you shouldn't have to jump through those hoops, and this game shouldn't even be for sale on Steam.

Forwarded to 2015, the game still feels lacking meaningful content. That being said, the community has come to save the game by introducing a mega mod called Fusion Mod.\n\nThe only way to truly enjoy Cliffs of Dover is by installing the mod really.\nMultiplayer is well alive with the mod and with the mod the game even manages to be better in qulity and feel than its legendary predecessor IL-2 1946 although 1946 still beats the Cliffs of Dover Fusion Mod by having more playables and theaters.\n\nThe mod adds dynamic campaigns to the game as well so don't worry about your single player experience as this too has been improved.\n\nTake the sentimental road down the historical timeline to the Battle of Britain with this game. You won't regret it. Just make sure you have the Fusion Mod installed.\n\nIn terms of simulation, Cliffs of Dover is still not as complex as say DCS study sim modules. However, this is not necessarily a bad thing. Cockpits are clickable (the levers, switches, knobs, etc) but they took shortcuts in terms of the most miniscule details which is fine after all we are to play the game not study them. That being said, again, Cliffs of Dover is far more simulation than most flight games and even than IL-2 1946. They even simulate pitot heater.\n\nIf you love flight sim or if you love WWII warbirds, do yourself a favor and get this game and install the Fusion mod. You'll be doing yourself a great service. Might even prolong your life with all the fun and relaxation you are going to have with the game.\n\nFusion Mod is a must have.

If you're an experienced hardcore flightsimmer and/or real pilot (like I am) and you are willing to take the time and effort to immediately install Team Fusion's several patches - sequentially and individually - to make it playable, and you have gobs of patience, don't mind a steep learning curve, can put up with many bugs and an incredibly bizarre menu implimentation and structure ... etc. etc. etc., and you have the hardware (more than just a fast computer) then I'm fairly sure it will be very rewarding.  If you don't possess these attributes and are just a casual or arcade-style flyer then PLEASE don't bother wasting your money as you'll be pulling your hair out!\n\nPros:\n1. Absolutely stunning aircraft models featuring the most detailed realistic looking virtual 3D cockpits I've ever seen in a flight sim/game to date.\n2. Gorgeously modeled and rendered period landscapes and the ocean... OMG the ocean... It looks so real that when I roll the canopy back on my trusty Spit and swoop down to just above the wave crests I could swear I can smell and taste the salty Atlantic!\n3.  Extremely realistic dynamic lighting and shadows (especially in the cockpit) including sun glare.  It just doesn't get any more immersive!\n4.  Tons of options to set the realism experience to acceptible  levels while you learn to fly these very unique high performance period aircraft, each with their own very different strengthes and weaknesses.\n5.  While single player is an option, and a necessity to develop skills, online multiplayer is so immersive.  You may be in battles in your trusty Hurricane or Spitfire teaming up with real Brits, or you may choose to team up with real Germans flying Axis aircraft.  Conversely, you may choose to fly a Bf-109 against Britain and may be battling a real German flying a Spit for the RAF.  Of course, these days it's all in good fun, because you will all be brothers...  it's fantastic.\n\nI fell in love with this game after watching hours and hours of extremely immersive battles on Youtube.  There are also a ton of tutorials.  This makes the game/simulation well worth the effort if you're willing to perservere.  This game has been on my wish list for a long time.  Steam finally had it for $5.99 so I pulled the trigger.\n\nCons:\nIn addition to those I already listed there are quite a few with varying levels of importance.\n1. This isn't really a con per se, but a major consideration never the less.  Forget that crappy gamepad controller.  You will need a good joystick, rudder pedals, and headtracking device, such as TrackIR to make the most of this game and to protect your 6 o'clock!  I don't have a TrackIR but will snag one soon, or make a homemade one.  They're not that hard to make and Youtube has several how-to videos.\n2.  NO comprehensive manual!  This game/simulation is so complex that it needs a whopping thoroughly comprehensive manual to not only guide us learning each unique aircraft, but chapters on preparing us for the ultimate challenge that is WWII air combat.\n3.  It's still early for me as I just got Team Fusion Patch 4.0 installed this morning (still have a couple to go) and played for a few hours.  My initial impressions are that the flight models still aren't perfect.  Of course, without TF patches the aircraft are literally so twitchy as to be completely unflyable right out of the box.  Even now sometimes the aircraft are too twitchy and other times too forgiving.  Ground handling isn't all that realistic either.\n4. Setting up controls is a nightmare.  Unlike Microsoft and other titles in the past you don't get to set up your controllers and adjust for non-neutral axis bias.  My old CH Products rudder pedals seem to have a little right rudder bias and I can't tune it out.  Even trying to counter it with rudder trim makes me constantly have to 'step on the ball' with my left foot to keep my plane flying straight.\n5.  A fairly minor gripe is that the engine(s) always sound like it/ they are somewhere just above idle while in the cockpit, even at full throttle at War Emergency Power.  A 1700hp+ V-12 Merlin, or German equivalent, or any multi-cylnder radial WWII warplane engine with only short stacks and no mufflers is freakin' LOUD, even in the cockpit!  These sounds are like Elon Musk supplied them from one of his Tesla electric sedans!\n\nIn spite of all the things wrong with this title they got many things right.  I'm going to hang in there as it is immersive and a promising experience for those who perservere.  I'll add more to this review later, once I get more flight time.","January 12, 2015","true","19.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I am a veteran to the older Ill-2 and pacific fighters series, so perhaps my view is biased.  But I read enough horrible reviews to always keep me from getting it.  Most of the reviews claimed poor preformance, stability issues, and lack of mission/plane variety.\n\nI should have known by the amount of support that i'll-2 had gotten for all those years that they would continue to support this title as well.  Let me just say that this game is up to snuff now.  Although It's sort of more a simmulator than a game.  That is one of the best things of this series.  Is the fact that you can customize the difficulty on such a high level.  One can play it as an ultra realistic flight sim, turn off all the realism setting and play it as casually as you like, or even find a spot in between.\n\nThe damage and flight physics are spot on as well.  Plus they look great.  If I had any complaints Its the fact the vanilla version limits you to one map, north France/south England area(which is amazingly huge and detailed no question).  But if you want a change in scenery you will have to mod this.  And I am probably spoiled by the number of aircraft available in i'll-2, but I really miss the variety of russian, american and japanese planes.  Still I think there is something like 30 flyable aircraft, each with highly detailed interiors and exteriors.  Both bombers and fighters, and English and German.  Plus many more that the AI can control.\n\nI have yet to check out the multiplayer,  but even the single player alone...

The way the camera reacts to the plane's movements, the vibration, all of this makes the cockpit incredibly real. The clickable cockpit adds to it.\n\nNext, the sounds.

They are great games and insofar as I can tell, not being a pilot myself very accurate flight sims. Alas, IL-2 Cliffs of Dover is not up to their previous efforts. It feels like they got bored halfway through development and never really finished. There is only one campaign (British) and it is lamentably short. The German side is just a series of missions.  There are no promotions, medals, et hoc genus omne as there were in the earlier games. Also missing (at least I can't find it) is the small HUD display that gave you airspeed, direction and altitude when you were in cockpit view. Accurate though the instrument panel may be, trying to read it in flight without spending two hours memorizing the layout first is . . . inconvenient.  The flight sim enthusiast who is truly dedicated (for which read 'crazed') can be expected to do this. I just want a quick indicator of airspeed and so on while still in cockpit view. Also missing is the time skip control so it's necessary to put the plane on autopilot and advance speed or else fly an actual two hour mission in real time. See comment about flight sim enthusiast above.  The trouble is when you run into the enemy when the speed is at 16x normal things can get a bit hairy . . .\n\nThe quick mission builder is also nowhere near as good as previous versions where you could select almost any plane and a variety of maps and situations. In this one there are set scenarios and as far as I can tell you can't really adjust them. There is a full mission builder, but I never messed with that in the old games and I'm not touching it now as it was pretty complicated.  When I just wanted to shoot things down, the quick mission builder worked fine, when I wanted complicated, I started a career.\n\nHonestly compells me to admit that I actually bought this game two or three years ago, only to find my computer's graphics wasn't up to running it. So I've really only played it for the last week or so.\n\nDo I recommend it?  Yes. it's still a good flight sim if you buy it cheap.

Battle of Britain summer 1940 waas the most significant air campaign of WW11 and this game does it justice, in fact it's probably too detailed which is probably why the developers ran out of cash ! The scenery is stunning and the flight models are faithfully reproduced.\nI tried the Team Fusion mod for this and ended up reverting to the original vanilla game - I found the English Channel much better represented in vanilla, (the mod makes it look more like the Med), and also I prefer the sound of the .303 browning mg's in vanilla. Also the mod makes multi-engine German bombers too hard to shoot down with .303 ammunition, which kind of defeats the whole point of the game. I think Team Fusion have a German slant on this game ! If the battle had unfolded the way they've prtrayed it then I think we'd all be speaking German right now.

A lot of people will probably buy this game thinking that it is "Ace Combat" (which I enjoy), but it is SO NOT!.  This is a serious simulation and many when first playing think that their joysticks dont work with it etc because they cannot fly easily (eg. prop gyro effect will pull the plane off course, elevators need trimmed).  This takes practice and time to learn and the in game tutorials aren't great.  So, to cap it off, If you are looking arcadey don't look here.  If you are interested in an accurate flight sim or just want to see if you can fly from London to Paris in one of these old birds, then buy away. Hope this helped. ;)  PS.

Note that it is mandatory to use TEAM FUSION MOD. I couldn't even start the game without it. They put their time and pasion, and manage to turn mud in to gold. Yest there are way better planes out there, but this game really makes you feel like you are taking part in a WW2 battle, and at that there is no better sim. I do not recommand this game alone. My recommandation include the 3.1GB updates from Team Fusion. Please visit them at teamfusion.theairtacticalassaultgroup.com. Thank you guys.\n\n\n... Later on\n\nNow that I have a few hours in this sim, I am forced to chande my recomandation. Unfortunately even TF with all their pasion and hard work could not turn mud in to gold. this game has a huge problem detecting the objects, caculating force and mass. The result... a plane that will start turning on with engine on idle, or even with the engine turned off, planes that will not get to full speed to take of even at full throtle, the joystic sometimes does not work in game even when it is  configured in the settings,  and so on. In the original campaign  you can get a fly out of 6-7 tries but in the TF campaign, you got 100% broken missions, and by that I mean you can never take off,  you will spin around, you will start to move at about 80% throtle, and you will never go more then 40. I just went thru 20 tryes... in a row, and nothing is working, flaps, radiator, boost, nothing works. The rudder is ALWAYS to much left or right, and I don't mean my setup, but in the game, in game pedals moves slightly to the left or right and it is already way to much. This is not my first sim, DCS: P-51, FC3, A10-C, RoF, ♥♥♥♥♥hunde - simulator and in ANY of these I did not had this problems. I was going to get the newer IL-2 game also, but I am waiting for a free weekend or a demo to see how good it is. Maybe these problems are not present to all players, maybe there are mods for this... maybe, but if you buy the game, be aware that you can run in to these problems. TF is working on a new update and I hope they will manage to fix the game, I really do, but I honestly believe the problem is deep inside the game engine, and that is not somethong that you can easily fix. I would really love to play it since is the most immersive WW2 sim, so I will keep an eye on what TF is doing.","May 29","false","16.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Granted, it obviously looks better and the physics engine works a lot better than the previous versions. As a gamer with an average PC, I would not reccomend this game.

The buttons just don't work; if they're disabled for a reason, it could have at least told me\n\nTo add onto all of that, the variety of planes is fairly limited, compared to 1946. It would have been fine to only have a few, if I felt like they had a lot more depth or something than the ones in 1946, but they feel about the same. If anything, they feel a bit easier to handle.\n\nI don't see the point of buying this over 1946. 1946 just seems superior in every way. Maybe the flight model here is more realistic or something, but it's just so much less fun to play because of what's stated above.","March 14, 2015","false","10.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","2"

In terms of presentation, user interface, and overall atmosphere & immersion, it's just that much better in every regard. Both have that great, classic Il-2 'feeling of flight', and I'll probably keep CoD kicking around on my hard drive for a while, but for your modern-day Il-2(tm) fix Battle of Stalingrad is where it's at.\nBoth are great flight sims that focus on WW2, but Cliffs of Dover is *severely* annoying to (attempt to) use & enjoy. Stubborn user interface, unfinished everywhere, avoid it in favour of BoS.\nIf you already have CoD, get all of the Team Fusion mods (they're up to 4.312 I believe) and it'll be that much better. Both sims just seem to have an unfinished feel to them, unlike Il-2 1946, but in CoD it's painfully apparent.\n\nIf you want to start 'fresh', just get Battle of Stalingrad and save yourself the aggravation. ;)","April 15","false","62.2"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ceej12/recommended/63950/","ceej12","ceej12","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ceej12/","134 products in account","IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover is one amazing game, with lots of fantastic stuff and some not so fantastic things. But let's start with the good stuff. Each plane has a completely realistic cockpit, almost exactly as you would see in real life.The outsides of the planes are also realistically modeled. Sitting in your cockpit, you can see the shadows of the clouds on the ground, on your wing, even in your cockpit. Lighting and and effects look fantastic. But by far the part I find most fun is the damage. Each part of the plane can become damaged or destroyed, with different levels of damage. As you fly your HE111 on a raid over the city of Dover, enemy Spitfires will attacks. They'll come in from behind you can let you have it. Bullets hit your fuel tanks, causing leaks. Bullets hit your pneumatics, causing you to loose the ability to use landing gear. Bullets hit on of your elevators, and causes it to detach from your plane. A few rounds hit your oil lines, causing you to loose visibility as oil covers the windshield and eventually causes your engines to stop. Every part is damageable. Engines, windshields, turrets, landing gear, flaps, wings, wing-tips. Fire can start and tear apart your plane over time. But this is all the fun part. I find the most fun thing to do is set up a mission that pits you, flying a bomber with a few wingmen, against tons of enemy fighters. Then, when they damage you, you try to limp back home, or crash land, or bail out. It is very entertaining skimming along the surface of a field as one of your engines is on fire and your landing gear isn't down. The props. can hit the ground and break. You could also crash land in water, but then you can't zoom out and admire your nice landing. There are numerous planes to fly, mostly fighters, unfortunately, but there are a few bombers. But that's where one of the not so fantasitc things come in. It would be so much fun piloting some giant 4-engine German FW200, but you can't. Most of the cool planes are reserved for AI only. There is a mod that allows you to fly these, but it should have been included in the first place. Another rather negative thing is that this game is extreamly graphic intensive. You need a very good card to play it without lag. I have a good computer, so this isn't a problem, but big rating companies, such as IGN, took points off for being so graphic intensive. The British campaign is wierd, with some missions begin fun, and others, not at all. In one mission you attack a flight of German bombers, which is fun. Then there is missions where you get transfered from one base to another, and all you do is fly. No combat. The last mission was just plain stupid. Instead of having some amazing finish with tons of explosions or something else interesting, all you do is fly an airplane with the character's girlfriend on his lap. It was pointless. I couldn't resist going to a high altitude and nose diving into the ground. But the final thing to mension is that this game is a simulator, which means there are things you don't do in an arcade style game. Before you take off, you manage your planes fuel mixture, open the radiators, pull back the flaps, turn on the brakes, and then turn the engine on. And then you still don't take off, you wait for clearance to take off. While in the air, the plane is in control. You can manage everything from trim to the heater. Being a simulator, you will also often find yourself doing nothing. You often need to fly for a bit before you find the enemy. There is an auto-pilot feature which can help fix, but it's your choise. So basically, if simulators aren't your thing, this game may be a risk for you, but note you can change almost all the realism settings, so that your get waypoints; you don't need to to mess with fuel mixture, trim, ect; you can turn off stalls, spins, blackouts, and redouts; you can even make your plane invincible. So in the end, this game can work for anyone. Just make sure you have a joystick, as the plane can't fly with the mouse, only a joystick or the arrow keys. My score: 8/10.","June 4, 2013","true","33.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Community is strong, I suggest looking up youtube videos and joining one of the major groups who provide full historical based player vs player missions, ATAG and ACG are the respective dominate ones. You will need Team Fusion patches to play, which again one of these groups and their Teamspeak 3 servers will be happy to set you up, they did for me and I was a stranger.\nI believe Team Fusion is still actively making the patches for this game after all the years, and it is worthy of a 10$ pick-up. Purchasing it now may help guide the developers for the future. The cockpit is well modelled, the graphics are polished well enough, the cockpit is fully clickable, and a joystick will give you a sense of realism. Forget about a numbered score, you can't rate the feeling of shooting down your first kill knowing that if this were really a flying death machine, you'd be able to fly it.\n\nEdit: After months of flying, it is officially my favourite game.","February 18, 2015","true","812.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
