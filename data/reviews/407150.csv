I couldn't wait to check out the Sniper Edition spin off.\nFortunately, the emphasis on mechanics is not noticeably reduced but is changed in a very clever and elegant way. The duality in operation, sniper on the one hand and the collector on the other, creates an interesting interplay and adds good balance to the puzzles once again. Now you don't have to move a bit but can shoot the rocks with a rifle from a secluded safe spot. This advantage is counter balanced by the limited mobility of the collector since it can only move along the surfaces. This makes some tasks easier but others more tricky. It turns out that this game, like its predecessor, has a good balance. The sophistication and diversity of the puzzles proves it once again.\n\nOverall it seems more "lightweight" than the original Trap Them but it will still frequently make you feel like a total re-tard. As a puzzle fan you will have a lot of these “oh that is an elegant solution” moments.\n\nFinally, I want to state that both Trap Them games are masterful works. It is mind-blowing how much diversity can be created with a small set of tools.","November 6, 2015","true","80.6"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

Controls aren't up to the task, but the logic is.

If you like puzzles then this is right up your alley.  A sniper rifle and a crystal collector isnt your usualy tools but they work well in this case.  For all it costs this game definatly worth the money.  The puzzles arnt too simple and do get harder as the game goes on so a little thinking may be involved.\n\nThis game was sent to me free of charge for review.","October 11, 2015","true","0.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

If you like puzzles, this is fairly competent with decent controls.  It even partially works with a gamepad, although you still have to use a mouse for the sniper part of levels.  I would have much preferred to toggle control between the two and have full controller support.  I thought this looked much more fun and calculating than the non-Sniper-Edition.  It was OK.  Very good for someones college-level school project, or a home project.  However, it didn't pull me in enough to make me want to keep going.  Hard to recommend as a paid-game, but good job for someone's small project.  (2/5 stars, still good for trading cards).","May 11","false","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And I have, so here's my take on his game! A pretty challenging game that feels mostly solid in playability. If your into this style of visuals, and enjoy puzzle games. Then I do recommend such a game as this.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_b5gLqCbtqU","October 12, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
