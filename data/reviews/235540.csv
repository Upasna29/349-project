You should join/form a group/clan in the long run or just be fine with those random dudes in public games – it's not impossible to master higher difficulties in public games but it's less likely for sure in WH:Vermintide.\n- 1st person melee combat may not be liked by everyone - but I was surprised how many of my friends who disliked the combat in Chivalry: Medieval Warfare now enjoy this game as it is PvE not PvP. A big difference!\n- hard difficulty means HARD DIFFICULTY atm, epic and legendary loot tiers require high game difficulties to get any chance at all rolling them ... you need a team of capable FPS/Chivalry players to proceed to those nice and shiny loot things! (I hope it stays this way... good loot should always be a challenge to get not only a matter play time and pure grind)\n- "head bobbing" can't be turned off yet so ppl with motion/simulation sickness be aware of this (or avoid 2H-weapons to minimize the shaking effect)\n- No color blind mode yet\n- Just one master volume slider meaning loud music all the time or low game volume... I got used to it but meh\n- No dedi servers yet (but promised)\n- Once again: playing public games is not ideal as some ppl (as like in any game) may not care about team play that much or have (yet) no clue how to react to certain events - I recommend to play it with friends or to quickly make friends with good players along your runs to master that learning curve together! Individual player skill is one thing, to form a successful permanent team needs time but it's very rewarding.\n- The loot system is very very random atm. If you're unlucky you won't get a good item for your preferred class after days of game time.\n\nState of game development:\n-The game has still some flaws with stability that might need treatment by the user...\nfor e.g.: GTX680/GTX770 users might need to down clock their GPU by 40mhz with nvidiainspector.exe to avoid crashes (common problem in a lot of games these days...)\n-The game does not feel finished and polished balance and hit box wise, but it's playable - good luck finding another good COOP vs AI game those days so it's ok for me :)\n- The game Devs seem to care and fix stuff kinda quickly - so that's promising for existing and future issues.\n\n\nTo sum it up:\n\nThis game is an awesome TEAM CHALLENGE!\nL4D and L4D2 PvE are a cake walk compared to this.\nLike it or not, you will first fail, then hopefully learn, group up, maybe give up (!) or succeed through higher tiers of swarming PvE COOP madness!\n\n\nOr you don't care about good loot, (get drunk) play it on easy with friends and have a good time for some hours - totally fine too ;)\n\n\n===\n*edit  2015-10-26th :\nSituation in public games has slightly improved since more and more ppl are kinda experienced and the Devs set the in game VoIP to “ON” by default so others can at least hear you talk to them.\nI'm still missing some tactical shout outs like in Killing Floor or Insurgency like “follow me!”, take cover here!” (best with 3D marker) etc. to improve basic and quick communication.\n\nThe random special enemy spawns make any run on any difficulty very unpredictable as you might encounter a Rat Ogre plus a Scaven swarm plus 2-3 special enemies at once! I have to say I like this randomness because if you master that … that's just awesome!\nOn the other hand this means any run “only” on hard difficulty with 4 experienced mates in Teamspeak can end in a disastrous wipe – you never know!\nHowever, this is quite rare on lower difficulties so plz don't nerf this too hard... it keeps the same map tense like any small village you enter in DayZ - like you never know what's waiting for you around the next corner. A possible adrenalin rush and that feeling on a successful comeback - not many games aside from close competitive league games may trigger this on me:)\n\nSome helpful links and tips for beginners to break that hard learning curve:\n- Tome and Grimoire locations: http://www.vermintidedb.com/missions.php\n- Tutorials on the official forums: http://forums.fatsharkgames.com/categories/tutorials\n- New player advice on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Vermintide/comments/3oujwq/new_player_advice_thread_odoom/\n\nIf you start the game for the first time you should set your FOV to 90 and the “Player Outlines” to “always on” so you won't be hitting the dwarf and elf all the time like I did in the fist hours of game cause you may confuse them with Scavens … no offense ;)\n\nAlso I recommend to rebind “Target” from “T” to “F” or something as marking special enemies and equipment is very helpful and the T-key feels to be too far off as you should need it a lot. Also enable/bind push to talk for public games and you may increase the gamma by a good bid to see what's lurking in all those dark corners waiting to back stab you...\n\nMany thanks for your nice replies guys – have fun slaying those rats!\n===","October 23, 2015","true","96.5"," 1,236 of 1,327 people (93%) found this review helpful 70 people found this review funny","93","236","1","70","54"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Flamov/recommended/235540/","Flamov","Flamov","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Flamov/","394 products in account","One of my personal 'sleeper hits' of this year. Basically Left 4 Dead with classes, a loot system and fantastic melee combat. Very satisfying as I've been yearning for something to fill the void that Left 4 Dead left many years ago. It's a little rough around the edges at times (bugs, questionable design choices, glitches etc.) but for the majority of the time it's very good fun. Even more so on higher difficulties – Left 4 Dead became a cakewalk after several months even on 'Expert'/'Hardcore', while the highest difficulty ('Cataclysm') in Vermintide is seemingly impossible (which is a good thing)!\n\nI really, really, really hope they keep working on the game, because it's so much fun when it works! There's a lot of things to fix that are shying regular and new players away, but I believe if those things are fixed this game could very well be one of the most enjoyable co-op survival games in recent memory.

I began my review exactly from saying few words about l4d,because "Vermintide" is somehow alike in co-operative mode. But it still differs from l4d. The point is the same, you are 4 brave warriors in game and no one but you can stop flooding monsters(different kinds) from the dark places.   You have to stop'em,complete various missions,save the world and obviously survive. There are more than 25 gaming locations. They're big and look really nice ,no doubts. The game's graphics are awesome. More over there are 5 vivid characters which have got unique abilities and you can choose one of them. The game is based on melee combat, so if you're keen on swords,daggers,axes etc. you will definitely like it. Btw,there's a pleasant thing-crafting...and some other cool stuff! In conclusion I wanna emphasise this is not a clone of "Left 4 Dead". Though you can see some close similar features,this game is different and interesting in its own way.

Why?  Well, keep on reading.\n\n\nPros:\nFun, addictive gameplay.  Doubly so if you have friends.\nTough difficulty, rarely holds your hand\nGorey, visceral feeling combat\nGreat SFX\nGood GFX, really portrays the doom and gloom feeling of Warhammer\nLoot based system keeps you playing\nRandomly spawning enemies keeps things fresh\nAll 5 characters have unique playstyles\n\nCons:\nDifficulty(yes, both a pro and a con) If you try to bite off more than you chew too often, soon you'll find yourself 3 or 4 games without a victory or any loot\nVery little reward for failure\nHit boxes are a bit strange, sometimes you will hit when you don't expect to or miss when you expect to contact\nFrustrating pick up groups.

Sticking with randoms can work too but it can also be very frustrating. It borrows many elements from the L4D series and if you are even slightly familiar with those games you will instantly recognize them, but this turns out to flow well in it's own way, succeeding to differentiate itself nicely from the L4D style.\n\n\nOverall, buy this game if you enjoy simple, gorey team-oriented action with a dash of RP elements.\n\nOr if you hate rats.

You play one of five characters each with slightly different play styles and each with a variety of possible weapon choices unique to them. You play through missions with simple objectives and recurring crescendo events against a horde of rat men, finding supplies on the way. You get a random piece of loot after each mission. Weapons can be upgraded/broken down/crafted with the Shrine and Anvil in the inn lobby.\n\nWHAT THIS GAME IS NOT:\nA deep RPG with lots of choices and builds with narrative and story.\n\n\nI recommend playing with friends and I recommend not playing on difficulties higher than your item level. The experience is severely diminished by the crap AI bots. However, if you do try to play solo, I've compiled some useful information that may help.\n\nTIPS FOR PLAYING SOLO:\n-AI partners are awful in many ways. Be prepared for frustrating deaths for stupid reasons.\n-Get good with Sienna, Victor, and Markus. If you play as Sienna or Victor, you will get Kerillian Bot, Bardin Bot, and Markus Bot. If you play as Markus, you'll get Kerillian Bot, Bardin Bot, and Sienna Bot. There is no Victor Bot. Kerillian Bot is by far the best, Bardin Bot is decent, Markus Bot is mediocre, and Sienna is wholly terrible in all ways.\n-AI Bots have whatever weapons and equipment the host player has them equipped with. Recommendations from my experience: Bardin, axe and shield plus handgun or crossbow. Kerillian, dual daggers or sword and dagger plus swift bow or hagbane bow. Markus, great hammer or sword and shield, plus handgun. Sienna, bolt staff with longsword or flaming sword.\n-Bots get regularely trounced by big armored enemies. This can be helped significantly if their weapons have the Devastating Blow perk.\n-The AI will religiously persue ratling gunners and ignore everything else, including you and the gutter running stabbing your face, and the rats who are attacking them while they take cover. I recommend a handgun, crossbow, bolt or beam staff, or other such high power long ranged weapon so you can quickly deal with gunners yourself.\n-Rat ogres will probably kill you, as the AI is bad at dealing with them. Keep a strength potion and a black powder bomb on hand. Strength potions double damage of bombs as well as your weapons, so take the potion and then throw the bomb at the ogre if you want to stand a chance. Victor's double pistols, Kerillians Hagbane bow, and Sienna's beam staff are very good at killing rat ogres.\n-AI will only pick up healing items if you already have one. They won't pick up bombs or potions ever. The AI will pick up tomes, but only if no healing items are available and if you are already carrying a tome or healing item.\n-Friendly Fire is active on Nightmare and Cataclysm difficulty only, and only applies to ranged weapons and bombs. Don't worry about friendly fire from the AI; they barely ever use their ranged weapons, and when they do they can generally be trusted to be accurate. The AI however does not take into account when you are using your ranged weapon. If you play as Victor or Sienna, be prepared to shoot your AI partners fairly often as they like to stand behind you when idle and then run through you when an enemy approaches. Try to use slightly higher ground when available, like standing on boxes or stairs.\n-The AI does gain benefits from trinkets. Trinket recommendations: reduced damage from poison gas, faster revival, healing all allies when healing self, healing self when healing an ally. Do not equip bots with the luckstone; this only affects you when you open a chest, and bots will never open chests.\n-The AI is extremely bad at avoiding Stormvermin Patrols. If you hear one, run very very far away and hide in a corner until they pass.\n-Man the Ramparts has no Stormvermin Patrols, nor a rat ogre. Good map for grinding.\n-The AI does not do a good job of keeping up with you if there are any rats about. Move slowly and methodically clear locations before proceeding so you don't accidentally leave their stupid asses behind.\n-Ignore Sack Rats if they are already running away. Be an ambush predator if you want to kill them. If you can, snipe them in the head with a handgun, but if you miss, don't chase them; the AI won't be able to keep up with you.","May 11","true","246.9"," 158 of 190 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","158","190","7","0"

The game is best described as Left 4 Dead set in the Warhammer fantasy universe with a much heavier emphasis on melee combat, with a few extra bells whistles added to the mix.\n\nThe core mechanics are solid and robust, and the weapons feel enjoyable and satisfying. You can really feel the weight of the two handed hammer and the damage it causes when you pulverize a Stormvermin with a charged attack. Do not worry if you’re not a fan of bulky, blunt weapons however, as the game features five heroes on launch, each with unique playstyles and specialized equipment to aid them in combat. For example, the Waywatcher, Kerillian, uses her bow to pick off unaware targets from afar but can also get up close and overwhelm her enemies with her signature twin Elven daggers. On the other hand, Sienna Fuegonasus, the Bright Wizard, would rather use her staff to rain fiery death upon her foes, decimating the Skaven rank one fireball at a time, so no matter what your combat style is, there is a hero build for everyone.\n\nThe loot system for many players would be the primary motivation to keep on playing the game. Every time you emerge victories, you’re given a chance to roll for a new piece of equipment, completing side objectives such as securing tombs, the infamous grimoires as well as winning on higher difficulties will give you a better chance at securing a rarer loot. Rarer equipment comes with better stats as well as additional passive traits which in turn will give you the much needed edge on the blood soaked battlefield.\n\nWith a diverse hero selections also comes a good selection of enemy types, Stormvermins acts as the shock troops of the Skaven army, soaking up damage with their heavy armour and dishing out punishment with their long reaching halberds, while the Poison Wind Globadiers lobs poisonous globes to deny key chock-points and areas. At the while Gutter Runners and Packmasters tries to pick off vulnerable party members under the cover of Ratling Gunner’s unrelenting gunfire, and if all else fails, the Rat Ogre will be called upon the battlefield, a formidable enemy that can devastate all but the most organized teams. When it all comes together, the combat is hectic, bloody and extremely rewarding.\n\nHaving said that, Warhammer: End Times – Vermintide in and of itself is quite a repetitive game, you can finish all the thirteen missions that were offered on launch within eight hours or so, and thus relies on players to replay missions to acquire better loots in order to tackle the same missions on higher difficulties. Some would find this tedious and uninteresting, which is perfectly understandable, but for the others, this can be compelling and satisfying, you’ll have to ask yourself if you enjoy this type of gameplay.\n\nTo conclude, Warhammer: End Times – Vermintide is a mechanically sound game with excellent combat and challenging game-play, and best played with a group of friends as teamwork is the key to success. The random loot drop system will keep players entertained should they don’t mind replaying the same missions over and over again for progression. That, and the competitive launch price of $29.99 USD or your regional equivalent, makes this title worth checking out.","January 3","true","186.2"," 136 of 160 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","136","160","6","5"

It is most enjoyable when played with friends while communicating on voice chat.\n\nVermintide has a heavy emphasis on melee combat with ranged weapons being more reserved for sniping and situational combat scenarios. So be prepared to hack and slash your way through hordes of rat monsters most of the time.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are very well-balanced and have been refined to play smoothly. There are a number of quirks regarding the range of the special rats, notably the Packmaster, but I suspect these issues will be fixed over time by the game developers.\n\nOverall, difficulty-wise, when I first started Vermintide, I thought that the hardest difficulty level: Cataclysm was undoable. However, once I fully understood the game's combat mechanics, rhythm and tactics & strategies, I realised that this game simply requires combat skill, timing, positional awareness and a good communicative team to complete it on any given map and difficulty setting.\n\nNow, having completed the game and cleared everything, I await to see what new content Vermintide will receive with its upcoming patches and DLCs.","November 30, 2015","true","321.5"," 81 of 92 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","81","92","3","6"

I don't even know if there really is an option such as that (the kicking), that may stem from me never needing to try to kick someone out from the team.\nAs for the teamplay with random people, while searching around during a calm phase of a map, my random partner and I stumbled on a health kit. We both suffered a certain degree of injuries in which a health kit would be advised. We had a few seconds of staring at one another to decide who gets to heal themself. My partner took the kit, but then healed me.  After that one moment of kindness, I stuck with that person regardless of how suicidal things got (such as frontal charges at a ratling gunner). Needless to say we failed a few games due to such recklessness, but we failed with humor.\nCoordination with a random team is usually based on intiative. There are occasions in which the entire team hesitates. But once someone takes a step, everyone, in most experiences, jumps right into the hot mess and throws anything they haven't thrown yet at the ratling onslaught.\nCompared to when I play with friends, where the tendancy for horse play is large. I do feel like that there is a degree of purpose in this since teamworks mean better everything in the game. I am happy to say that I have not yet, luckily, had a good game screwed over because of the purposeful action of a team member.","November 13, 2015","true","127.4"," 82 of 95 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","82","95","6","0"

Rats that you kill will topple over eachother, and throw guts everywhere. You can go decently in-depth with push attacks, blocks and charged attacks.\nThe game forces you to stick with your team, due to the fact that there are special rats that can pin you down. You can't do anything to help yourself, and must rely on teammates to free you. There's a good variety when it comes to these special enemies. One that pulls you away and requires your teammates to run after you to help, another that throws poisonous gas that can separate the team, one that has a gattling gun, and one gigantic rat that will require everyone's efforts.\n\nThe game is actually very hard, which is a refreshing change from most games nowadays. Luckily everyone I've run into so far has been very friendly and willing to co-operate.\n\nThe maps have decent variety, and many times allow you to interact with the world by exploring secret rooms that could contain loot that might help you in the level, like speed up or healing potions. You can also things like Tomes or a Loot die, which will give you better loot at the end of a level.\n\nSpeaking of loot, there's a lot you can gather for each class. If you don't like the stats of some of your equipment, you can salvage it with other loot of the same rarity for something new.\n\nAll classes that you can choose from play quite differently, and allow for some strategic play. One character can pierce through armor with normal attacks, where as others would have to do charged attacks. One character can shoot fireballs at far away enemies and hurt a wide area. I personally find them all fun to play, and find myself cycling through them.\n\nThe game does a good job at sucking you into its world. It's very immersive due to the beautiful graphics, well realized environment and natural dialogue. Characters will have funny banter, or communicate to one another about a specific found item, or area they have stepped into. It's really well done.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this game. It's very well polished, takes a lot of fun elements from other games, and improves upon them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toquina/recommended/235540/","toquina","Overkill_Ashley♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toquina/","302 products in account","Set within the Warhammer lore, Vermintide is a four player co-op survival game based in the fictional city of Ubersreik. Under attack from endless hoards of vermin known as the Skaven, four unlikely heroes must use teamwork to stand a chance against overwhelming numbers.\n\nWhen starting the game for the first time, players will first notice the lack of any tutorial or practice arena as they find themselves thrown into a tavern which operates as the mission hub. Players can select missions from the tavern which will then find them a game or allow them to host it themselves. This Is where I met my first problem within Vermintide, confused and with no information I found myself unable to find any games. After checking the forums I found that servers had been disabled for maintenance. After maintenance I joined my first game and soon found that games were managed with a peer to peer system. It seems unusual that matchmaking must be taken down and all games must come to a halt when the game lacks the use of dedicated servers. Many games that run with a peer to peer system can find games without needing a matchmaking server. After finally getting into my first game I immediately got to the fast paced hack and slash I had been waiting for.\n\nCombat within Vermintide can be described as “simple yet satisfying” as it lacks depth but still provides a gratifying experience. Weapons operate with a simple system which takes into account damage, reach, knockback and speed. With a total of five characters, each character having their own selection of weapons there is plenty of variety to find the weapons to suit your playstyle, be it defensive, one hit wonder or crowd control. Shields are great for players who want to defend their friends and keep the tide of vermin back. Two handed swords to slice huge groups into a pink paste that leave you somewhat slow. Fast daggers with little reach for devastating damage against a single target one at a time. With each character having their own arsenal with its own variety you can play as any character you want, however you want to play. If the loot system lets you. Each weapon has the option for a quick and heavy attack, the differences between the two attacks depend on the weapon used. Players looking for heavy depth won't find it here but those looking for a tactical hack and slash will find it satisfying for many hours. While combat is basic there is a simple learning curve which is heavily focused on movement management to avoid taking damage. There isn't really too much to say, simple but effective and sometimes simplicity can be much more satisfying then complexity.\n\nTeamwork is a heavy focus of the game, as four players will be the victim to a number of special enemies that excel at killing anyone who strays alone. The Packmaster carries a hook which can pull players away from the group amidst the chaos of a hoard, reminds me a little of the smoker from Left 4 Dead. The Globadier prays on campers by covering large area of the map in a toxic cloud. After taking enough damage he'll suicide and explode into the group, heh that reminds me of the boomer from Left 4 Dead. The Runner rat pounces around the map and once it catches a player it will leave them helpless as it claws away. Okay I hope I am not the only one starting to see a pattern here. The biggest and final special enemy is known as the rat ogre, a huge mass of muscles that flings players around the map. Considered the boss of each map they take teamwork to take down with the heaviest of fire-power. Yep.. it's a tank, it looks almost identical with similar sound effects complimenting it. This game is Left 4 Dead and it's not subtle about it in any stretch of the imagination. Four players fighting through mindless hoards of enemies as they progress through the map, looking out for special enemies that are specialized at killing anyone who wanders off alone. Yes, this is Left 4 Dead with rats and we'll come back to this! Disregarding the extreme similarities these enemies still work well, forcing the team to quickly change tactics to adapt to new threats.\n\nWhen looking at the characters, elf caught my eye and was immediately my first choice. After completing my first mission I was rewarding with two new weapons, a mace and a magic staff. I scratched my head a little as I soon realized neither of these were for the character I actually wanted to play. This brings with one of the greatest and most frustrating issues with Vermintide, the loot drop system. After each mission players roll six dice in an attempt to get better loot. Unfortunately the loot selection is completely randomized leaving even a perfect roll with frustration as you get another item not for your character. Currently after playing roughly 30 hours as elf I own 3 exotic staffs for the mage but have yet to find a single bow for the elf I enjoy using. It can destroy the motivation to play as you feel unable to play as the character you enjoy most. Better gear for other characters constantly piling up, never to be used if its for a character you don't enjoy playing. This issue desperately needs attention and can be a real killer for the game for those looking to invest a lot of hours. While the game offers players a number of ways to play, if you simply don't find the gear you need to play that way it can only harm your motivation to play.\n\nA number of other issues I also experienced was poor optimisation and numerous bugs. At periods of gameplay my framerate would remain consistent but the game would slow down as well as separate occasions of high frame rate dropping. While these issues were minor I soon found myself with a long list of little things that irritated me as I played.\n\nLets get back to the elephant in the room, this game showing extreme similarity to Valves Left 4 Dead games. With many enemies having identical roles and combat being almost identical in many aspects  its clear that heavy inspiration was taken from Left 4 dead. Is this a bad thing? No, not on its own. In gaming many games have taken inspiration from earlier titles and improved upon them, I don't feel there is anything wrong with it as long as it finds its own place within the market. This leads us to the question, does Vermintide have enough originality to give it its own identity? If you already owned Left 4 Dead, would it be worth buying? My answer would be yes, but only just. While its clear that both games are extremely similar, a focus on melle combat over guns and medieval setting does give it enough to become its own branch in the co-op survival genre. Though you can complain all you want, I'm still going to call the rat ogre a tank every time! Old habits die hard.\n\nPutting the similarities between Vermintide and Left 4 Dead to the side, lets look at Vermintide on its own merits. This is one of my reviews where I read through it and feel I didn't give enough praise. A number of bugs and issues throughout the game can be frustrating however with everything said the core concept is an entertaining and challenging hack and slash. Great weapon variety leave open a number of playstyles that all have their own role within a team. Defensive or aggressive there will be a weapon set that fits you perfectly, with that said Vermintide needs a lot of polish to smooth its rough edges. Will the developers give this title the polish it desperately needs to be something sensational? We'll have to wait and see.\n\nIf you're looking for something to play with your friends it's definitely worth looking at and a sure buy if you see it on sale! At full price, be cautious and aware of the game's faults before you spend your cash but many people will be satisfied with their purchase. If the game gets continuous support from its developer and improve some of the major issues, i'd happy suggest it to anyone who enjoys cooperative gameplay.","November 2, 2015","true","56.0"," 160 of 217 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","160","217","4","12"

I love Vermintide. This game came out of nowhere and has just truly impressed me.\n\nWarhammer: End Times - Vermintide was developed by Fatshark, best known for Lead and Gold, War of the Roses, and Krater. Without a doubt, this is their finest product yet and one of my favorite games this year.\n\nVermintide shares a ton of similarities to Left 4 Dead (a formula I’m a little surprised hasn’t been emulated much). It’s a four player cooperative experience where you and a your team need to get from point A to B while fending off hordes of monsters. This time (thankfully), it’s not roaming herds of zombies. It’s giant rat men.\n\nThere are a total of five characters to choose from, each representing their own distinct class. The Dwarf Ranger and the Empire Soldier are primarily built as tank classes. The Elven Waywatcher and the Bright Wizard deal out heavy damage from from away. And the Witch Hunter falls somewhere in the middle, he can play as a ranged class or as a primarily melee class. But since it’s Warhammer, everyone carries ranged weapons to compliment their melee weapons. The game finds a great balance between the two styles of fighting for every character and the best players will know and when is ideal to quickly switch between the two\n\nAs you finish maps, you roll the dice to get new gear, and every piece of gear can drastically change how each character plays. There are opportunities to obtain more dice in each map to increase your chances of getting better loot. A sword and shield will play much differently than a two handed hammer or a one handed mace. There are a variety of bows with a range of special effects. The Bright Wizard can go from crowd control to dealing pure pain. And special weapons have traits that can be unlocked through the games simple crafting system. Increased range, reduced stamina cost, health vamping, and more. The higher level you are, you are likely to come across and develop more and more complex loot that will help in the brutally tough levels of the game. The loot in this game is what will keep players coming back for more.\n\nBut the loot isn’t the only draw. The world and map design is stunning. It’s just beautiful. The game doesn’t hold your hand either (thankfully). Finding your way to the end of a new map is a big part of the fun. The maps are all unique to one another, ranging from creepy graveyard ruins, to the outdoors, to vacated city streets, to a twisted MC Escher-esque wizard tower. The world feels like it was once lived in, but abandoned because of the catastrophe.\n\nThere’s a good number of maps, but also a great challenge to go along with them. Each map can be set either as easy, normal, hard, nightmare and cataclysm.\n\nMost importantly, it’s fun. The realm of video games is in staggeringly short supply of enjoyable and challenging cooperative experiences. And though this is is heavily inspired by Left 4 Dead, in many ways it exceeds it.\n\nThere are a few elements that irk me a little. A couple maps, particularly the ones where you have to gather scattered supplies and bring them back to a central location, feel imbalanced to me. Even set on normal difficulty, these maps can quickly wipe a moderately experienced team.\n\nTwice in my twenty hours of playing the game, I’ve had servers reset… or something. All of the players will stay in the game, but the map would restart and we’d all be playing as a different character than the one we selected. Really weird.\n\nWhen playing with 2 people or more, the NPC bots do a great job of holding their own. Unfortunately, I found when playing solo, they tend to do some really stupid things, like getting stuck in the environment… or jumping off of buildings… and then the rest will jump off of buildings to save their buddies. I hope they get a little patch.\n\nAnd finally, the game does NOT feature any competitive multiplayer like Left 4 Dead. I personally never enjoyed the competitive play in Left 4 Dead, but I know that might be a dealbreaker for some.\n\nI’ve had a few different friends ask me about the game, if you only fight against rodents of unusual size. Yes, giant rats of various shapes and classes are the only enemy. If that sours the experience for some, I have to say the action and excitement far outweigh any minor issues I had with the game’s choice of enemies.\n\nThe developers have made promises for some DLC for the game and NO microtransactions. With a universe as rich as the Warhammer series, I’m hoping to see some greenskins, or maybe even some space marines action.\n\nIf you’re a PC owner, Vermintide is a must-own, especially at its budget price of $30. It’s just pure fun, cooperative arcade action set in a wonderful world.\n","October 27, 2015","true","30.2"," 89 of 111 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","89","111","3","1"

Then you'll most likely like this game. This game borrows a lot from L4D2, so i will be comparing the two. It's the same basic formula, 4 people cooperatively advance through a semi-open map trying to achieve an objective, encountering enemies along the way. Some enemies appear randomly at random times, so you don't always know what to expect. There are several different enemy types to spice things up.\n\nWhat is does different from L4D2 is classes and melee, melee is the focus of the game. All classes have ranged and melee attacks, although your ranged attacks are limited by ammo or energy, which you can resupply by exploring the enviroment to find supplies. The melee feels heavy and responsive, it's also diversive and most importantly, fun.\n\nClasses could be more specialized and diverse in my opinion, but they still all offer enough to make them unique. They are customizable as well, so you can actually attempt to specialize them to your liking.\n\nThe loot system is a hit and miss, depending on who you ask. It's random, and the only thing you can semi-control is how good your odds are. I'm not the biggest fan of that, but i can't argue with the gambling feeling of rolling the dice. You also get no loot if you fail the level, so you can spend 20-30 minutes only to loose in the final fight and get nothing but XP, or as in my case, the game crashing or losing connections, or the host leaving, which is a poor design, let someone else take over the host. So, it's subjective, i guess, you be the judge.\n\nHowever, it's buggy, very buggy. I have a 50/50 chance of the game crashing when i play. I seem to encounter the same bug over and over, that is the game crashing when i fire a weapon. There are also other less severe yet still annoying bugs. The game runs decent, but not nearly good enough to be acceptable.\nMind you, the game is to release in 4 days, and i honestly don't see how they can fix all the issues before that. So i'd advice you to wait and see after release.\n\nAll in all, huge potential, great core features, fun gameplay and well crafted from the ground up. But yet again, unstable at the moment.\nI give it a thumbs up despite the problems solely because it's still in Beta, problems like this at launch (or soon after) are unacceptable and i will change the review to a thumbs down if they're not properly handled.\n\nEdit: Since this is getting some views which didn't expect, i cleaned up the grammar a bit and clarified a few points for easier reading. I did not change anything significant that could affect the conclusion of the review.","October 19, 2015","true","41.2"," 87 of 109 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","87","109","4","0"

Objective of the game is to run through dark and spooky levels while slaughtering ratmen, which is usual activities at my post soviet village, so i can relate.\n\nGame has fair variety of ratmen specimens including rats with daggers, rats with torches, rats with spears, rats from Rome, rats from Assassin's Creed, rats with choke fetish, rats that gas people, rats with ratling guns (actual name), and last but not least - giant rat. All of them are differend, but have one thing in common: you have to kill them using your delightful arsenal of weapons.\n\nMelee combat has very satisfying mechanics and you can feel impact with every freshly decapitated rat, but if you're western martial arts enthusiast (never held actual weapons, but watch youtube channels, so you're profound expert) you will puke from everpresent backswings and offguards.

It's animated fairly well still.\n\nRanged arsenal has variety of oldschool black powder boomsticks, blunderbuses, rifles, repeaters with addition of bows and crossbows.

Bows and crossbows look less cool and shoot less loud, as you may expect.\n\nDifferent heroes use different weapons, like witch hunter mostly uses swords and firearms, but he can also use a crossbow or what not. Weapons are unlocked by getting levels or completing missions. After completing a mission you throw a dice. You get dices according to your performance and how many bonus loot like ancient tomes you carried to the finish. No matter how well you did - you will get common bow on elf girl because you are a looser. Jk bby you will get nice stuff, i promise!\n\nlevel design is cool, graphics are nice, sound is solid too.

You will assume the role of one of five heroes, each featuring different play-styles, abilities, gear and personality. Working cooperatively, you must use their individual attributes to survive an apocalyptic invasion from the hordes of relentless rat-men, known as the Skaven. Battles will take place across a range of environments stretching from the top of the Magnus Tower to the bowels of the Under Empire.\n\nSo there’s that.\n\nGameplayIf you’ve played Left 4 Dead then you’re more than prepared for this game.\nOr to be honest you aren’t. Warhammer: End Times- Vermintide requires a fair amount of teamwork and to be completely honest I feel like it’s even more important than in L4D.\n\nYou can choose between five heroes.\nFirst up is Viktor Saltzpyre, a Witch Hunter[www.vermintide.com]. Next up we have Kerrilian, a Waywatcher[www.vermintide.com].\nEasy to oversee is Bardin Goreksson, a Dwarf Ranger[www.vermintide.com]. Heating things up, literally, isSienna Fuegonasus[www.vermintide.com], a Bright Wizard. Last but not least have Markus Kruber, a Empire Soldier[www.vermintide.com].\nFans of the Warhammer Universe need no introduction to the heroes or rather classes and for everyone else I linked to the website for further information on the furious five and I highly recommend to check it out.\nI mean if I would start talking now about Sienna and Bright Wizards in general let’s just say it would take up the whole review.\nWhat I can say about the heroes is though that they’re all truly unique. Not only in appearance but also in the way you play them.\n\nLet’s give a quick look into the equipment of the heroes so you do have an idea on what you can expect their playstyle to be.\nActually let’s not do that. Again it would take up the whole review.\nPlease for the sake of the game and yourself visit the website to get a good look into each of the characters.\n\nSo let’s just say they’re all different.\nMost unique one is by far the Bright Wizard.\nSpamming your magic will build up too much heat and ultimately turn your friends, the flames of course, against you. You’ll notice a bar’s building up whenever you cast a spell which slowly decays if you’re not using any magic. If you do have to use magic however you can vent. What that means is that you can get rid of excess heat in form of smoke. Venting will damage you however but sometimes it’s the only thing you can do if you find yourself surrounded by a horde of Skaven.\nDepending on your staff you’re able to use different kinds of spells like the fireball, a signature move, or the CONFLAGRATION OF DOOM, marking an area on the ground ot create a pillar of fire which will ignite enemies within. And yes I had to put that one in caps because of it’s bad ♥♥♥ name! Don’t judge!\n\nThe game features different levels, with different objectives but it’s always the same.\nGet in, ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up, and get the hell out of there!\nYou can choose the difficulty level of each mission and to be fair I find normal to be too easy while hard gives you really a good challenge.\n\nYou’ll find potions, which will gives you a short bonus so strength for example, bombs, tomes, which will give you bonus experience at the end of the game and many more things that you can use and abuse to make your way through the levels.\n\nAt the end of the mission you’ll get experience points based on your score.\nYou’ll unlock new traits and equipment that way.\n\nThe game features a forge which you can use to either upgrade your favorite weapon or let’s you fuse five items of the same rarity to forge a new one.\n\nYou see the game’s quite a bit grindy but that’s actually quite enjoyable because the nightmare difficulty will make you hate your life and fear the Skaven and Rats in general!\n\nVisualsThe game looks absolutely gorgeous.\nI’ve seldom seen a game that blows me away even at the lowest graphic settings but Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide manages just to do that.\nThe blood, shadows, light … everything looks just so good. Especially the Skaven. Fatshark has really pulled it off!\nAnother sweet note is that you should pay attention to the behavior of the Skavens. For example I was heartbroken to see a Skaven shiver in pain when he see Markus and Kerrilan walking towards him. He pressed himself against the wall and looked left and right for a way to escape.\nI’m not joking. They will and do behave just like that .. just incredible.\nIt really breaks my heart to see such behavior since I’d love to play as a Skaven but … it’s just so good.\nSeriously it’s a magnificent looking game!\n\nAudioThe game sounds incredibly good. I guess that’s a no brainer considering that Jesper Kyd[www.jesperkyd.com] made the sountrack for the game. The Kyd is responsible for the OST of Borderlands, Darksiders II, Assassin’s Creed, Hitman and many many more. Considering that this isn’t your first so called vidya game it’s safe to say that you’ve been blown away by the Kyd’s music more than once.\nIt’s fitting, it’s a promise of danger, it suits the Skaven theme and … what is there to say?\nThe Kyd’s created another master piece … ‘Nuff said.\nI mean my favorite track by far is The Skaven Come Out To Play. It’s a short track but … god damn it just listen to it!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfsZhYiCNfA\n\nSkavenThere’s a huge variety of Skaven, please don’t call them rats … have some respect will ya?, in the game is just fantastic.\n\nOne just has to love the Skaven. I might be biased because the Skaven are by far my favorite Race from the Warhammer Universe and it’s just awesome to see them getting their own game … Well yeah it’s a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that they get destroyed the whole day but hey … one has to start somewhere amirite?\nFor example you have the Pack Master. Players refer to him as the Hook Rat … kids these days have no respect. Anyway he’s one pesky lil’ bugger!\nIf you don’t pay attention you’ll find yourself or one of your teammates choking to death and dangling from his polearm.\nLet’s not forget the Rat Ogre. He’s, as the name implies, not as little as his brethren and one could go as far as to say that he’s the Hulk of the Skaven. Seriously he’s going to ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up!\n\nThere’re a lot more such as simple clanrats, cannon fodder basically, and personally I hope they’re going to implement new types of Skaven in the future.\n\nWhat else can I say?Buy it. I mean it probably will be an insta buy for Warhammer fans, just like me, but you should really consider it.\nIt’s a welcome addition to the warhammer games and so far it’s excellent I can only recommend it I mean … Skaven! That’s reason enough to buy the game!","October 17, 2015","true","48.8"," 100 of 133 people (75%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","75","100","133","10","3"

What to say about this game...\n\nLike Warhammer?\nLike Left 4 Dead?\n\nLike 4 player co-op?\nHave friends to play with?\n\nLike PvE?\nHate rats?\n\nIf you answered yes to any pair of these, you'll probably enjoy this.\n\nThese pairings pretty much sum the game and gameplay experience up.\n\n1. Vermintide is pretty much Games Workshop's Warhammer spin on Left 4 Dead.\nEverything from the hordes, through to the Specials. With an End Times twist.\nThe only real difference being a Class base to your heroes. Each with a specified weapon set (no weapon swaps/pick ups), which you can edit at the beginning of each map, if you don't do so at the Tavern (lobby) between missions.\nAlso, ammo is somewhat scarce, so the combat is predominantly melee based.\n\n2. The game is a 4 player co-op, with 5 playable characters.\nEach has his own pros and cons, gameplay-wise.\nWhen playing with less than 4 players (full lobby), AI bots will fill the role of your teammate(s).\nUnlike other 4 player co-ops, teamwork is a lot more vital to mission success. Not only when dealing with the Skaven in numbers, but also completing objectives.\nYou can play solo (with AI "assist" - I used that term loosely), but it is not recommended above Normal difficulty, and once you get downed, it's very likely to be a mission failure.\n\n3. As stated, like L4D, this game is PvE.\nYour adversaries being Skaven, the Ratmen.\n\nSeeing as Fatshark are such big (self-admitted) L4D fans, and took A LOT of influence from the franchise - can you call it a franchise, if there's only two of them? It's not even really a series. Might just go with a "duology"... Anyhoo... - I wouldn't be surprised if one day they decided to turn the tables, and let players assume control of the Skaven Specials, a la L4D.\n\n\n\nThe devs did a great job on this game.\nThe maps are large, the load times are fast, and there is no latency between transitions to new area.\n*Note: once you progress to the next area, you can not return to the former, so it'd play to utilise any pick ups found, etc. before moving on.\n\nThere are hidden areas on the maps, so it pays to explore, if you have the time to spare. Also, through experience, you risk the chance of triggering a horde if you hang around too long, so be warned.\n\nWeapons and customisation is a bit of a touchy subject with this game... I'll just say that it leaves something to be desired.\nI understand the justification for the system, believe me, but when trying to create replayability factors for a game, let it be based on the gameplay experience itself (which this game definitely has), not and RNG reward system.\nIn my opinion, this is the only point this game falls short on.\n\nThat said, nobody's perfect.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game, and see myself continuing to play it regularly in the foreseeable future.","December 30, 2015","true","43.7"," 63 of 76 people (83%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","83","63","76","14","5"

Still present even past beta, you can randomly fall over and die. It seems that you can also randomly take fall damage for no apparent reason now. The frequency of such occurrences has increased  judging from the multitude of reports on this bug.\n\n2. The framerate seems to have taken a noticeable hit, I am now averaging 30 fps on horde heavy sections which is a heavy detriment to combat.\n\n3. The game can crash and freeze randomly, with very severe aftereffects. You can play an endurance round up to a very high number of rounds, but if the host's computer decides to crash or you randomly disconnect, then you (and other players in the lobby) will immediately restart the entire game with no compensation.\n\n4. If you die, you can possibly spawn behind your team, meaning that you spawned before a no-return point that your team has already passed.\n\nI know that my plea falls on some deaf ears, but my hope is that the developers make fixing these issues a top priority. For players who are looking to buy this game, the positive reviews you read are mostly true. They simply do not mention the various issues that you will come to be familiar with once you play for more than 40 hours or when you visit the forums. Consider these issues before you press the "Add to Cart" button.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI like this game for its combat and lore.\n\nHowever I can't wholly recommend a title like this with the bugs it currently has.\n\n1. Rats really love to hit you through everything in this game.\n-walls, ceilings, and floors provided that they are thin enough.\n-through other rats in a horde\n-the spot below you on stairs\n-right after their climbing animations (they cannot be interrupted while climbing, which means that you get hit because a rat decides to do a downward attack that requires almost no chargeup time.)\n-through your block if you're unlucky enough to push while they're in the middle of attacking.\n-behind you, if a rat decides to do a running charge, there is a pretty high chance for him to phase through your body and hit you from behind.\n\n2.  The special rats have a number of issues\n-If a Gutter Runner pounces a teammate and you're standing right next to them, you will be sent flying back a good distance away AND if you're jumping, you'll be sent flying back instead.\n-The Packmaster is made of light and has no corporeal form which lets them go through hordes like butter, grab me, AND run back all at the same speed.\n-The Rat Ogre will occasionally (read: a good 40% of the time) spin in place really quickly and make his attacks a bit more difficult to telegraph.\n-Continuing with the Rat Ogre, some of his spawns are very bugged which makes him either stuck in map geometry until we bait him out or just not appear at all. Some of the more well-known examples are: before the first grimoire in Enemy Below, next to the first grimoire in Garden of Morr, and the areas around the first grimoire in Engines of War.\n-The Ratling Gunner likes to shoot you through walls and this issue is still present even past beta.\n\n3. Multiple sound issues for maps and characters\n-Some characters may not finish conversations at all if another starts it.\n-Certain elements of the map may not have any sound at all. eg The horn is silent in Horn of Magnus, no rain or thunder in Man the Ramparts, no music for various maps.\n-Some of the game's subtitles do not clear when the character finishes talking which results in text spilling over into the HUD or off the screen. A really good example of this is The Grey Wizard's speech when you enter the event's room; there may be a subtitle for when a character is almost dead that remains on the screen and The Grey Wizard's speech spills off into the HUD as a result.\n-Certain weapon sounds are silent. eg. The Empire Soldier's repeater's sound is cut off at the end, the Witch Hunter's brace of pistols may occasionally be silent.\n\n4. Some achievements are bugged (disclaimer: I have obtained all of my achievements legitimately, I am only basing this section off of official reports from the developer)\n-Balthasar Gelt and its related Tome achievements were bugged near the release back in October which made getting it impossible.\n-The new achievements added alongside Sigmar's Blessing were bugged which allowed a player to automatically get the rest of the achievements illegitimately.\n-Furious Five and its related character achievements were bugged (in some cases) which made them impossible to get.\n\n5. The game is run on the host's computer which means that the movements of rats and essentially everything else is dictated by the host. This also means that the host has the advantage in not getting hit since there is a smaller chance of rats hitting you through your push and Rat Ogres are also much easier to dodge to name a few.\n\n6. The loot system of the game is locked behind four layers of RNG: The outcome of the game, the weapon and its color, the weapon's traits, and the proc percentages of those traits.\n\n8. The game is CPU intensive from what I have experienced so far. I have an AMD FX-8350 and an nVidia GTX 760. Without V-sync or a frame rate cap on, I can average 110 fps normally but slow down to 40-50 fps during hordes. I don't know about Intel users, but a friend of mine of who has an Intel i7-3770 and a Radeon HD 7950 has about the same frame rate as I do.\n\n\nThe game is fun and even more fun with friends or a well-coordinated group, but its various issues hold it back from being the definitive 4-player coop shooter/slasher. If you're looking for a fun time with friends, then I suggest that you buy this title when it has a deeper discount (preferably below 20 or 15 USD). I bought this game and participated in the beta because I was looking a game to tide me over from Payday 2's Crimefest 2.0 fiasco and I can't say I was disappointed. If you look past its various issues, you have a Left 4 Dead clone that sets itself apart from its original with its visceral combat and apparent faithfulness to the general lore of the Warhammer series. Though, I would not recommend this title until its various issues are rectified.","January 3","false","570.1"," 114 of 156 people (73%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","73","114","156","7","0"

The Skav Rats are more smarter, deals a LOT of damage that you never expected and more responsive to you actions so "Teamwork" is "Far More Important". If you do not cooperate with your team you will die and lose horribly. Its no joke because the Skav will horde you down in many ways. Regular Rats which are very simple to kill and have funny reactions but are smart. The Armored Rats which either comes alone, in 2 or a Patrol which YOU MUST AVOID AT ALL COST. You have the Gas Rat that can make you lose your standing defensive ground and will mess you up. You have the Gunner rat which will target one of your team and will deal massive damage. The Taskmaster Rat which will drag you away then hang you. Finally the Rat Ogre which will literally pin you down.\n\nEasy mode is like playing normal mode. Quite easy.\nNormal mode is hard mode. Because you can actually lose on the Prologue.\nHard mode is challenging because you will not have any healing potions equip at the beginning.\nNightmare is where Friendly fire is activated and the enemies seems to be more smarter. Also you can practically die instantly without going down for revive so be warn about your health and medkits.\nCataclysm....May the Gods be with you.\n\nNow some mission maps has these Tomes and Grimoire that can be collected to boost your experience and reward but be warn about the risk. Either your health will be reduced to a mere 25% from 100%, you will take more damage or when picking up a tome/Grimoire you will instantly get down. Now if you successfully completed a mission, you will roll dies to gain random weapons so its pretty much RNG. Each weapons give different stats that will help you on your gameplay so they really make a difference on how you want to proceed.\n\nAtm there are some minor bug issues but the Developers has been fixing and working on the issues since Closed Beta so its nice to see they are doing something and making improvement of optimization to the game.\n\nAlso, this game is not recommended for any easy going gameplay. This was intentional to be hard because you are playing a Warhammer Game.

You will need to learn to use charge attacks, pushblock and dodge, without those nuanced skills you will find yourself taking alot of needless damage. Ranged weapons are primarily utility, as ammunition can be scarce. However, swapping between melee and ranged weapons is very quick with your only limitation being the associated weapon's reload speed, allowing them to be used reflexively based on the situation (such as taking out that pesky Ratling Gunner on the roof).\n\nCautionThe game advertises "mountains of shiny loot", which will flip a switch in some people (myself included). Don't come into this game expecting an action RPG, don't expect to have a "main character" that you level up exclusively, don't come into this thinking the main point of the game is to grind for loot. This is Left 4 Dead, you play the game because you find it fun. Unlike L4D you will have a chance at earning loot upon successfully completing a level which can be used only by a specific character, but you won't always get an item for the one you are playing. This is likely to encourage you to try out different characters.\n\nI point this out because many people are understandably miffed by how heavily RNG focused the loot system is, comparing it to Destiny. Unfortunately it seems alot of these (valid) criticisms are made by people who are putting the loot first and the game second, perhaps because they had the wrong idea about what this game's design philosophy seems to be.\n\nSummary if you want an extremely competent and challenging co-op FPS game with an atypical melee focus and are willing to put the loot as a secondary motivator for playing instead of the primary one, I highly recommend you pick this one up.","October 20, 2015","true","47.9"," 51 of 63 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","51","63","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/235540/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Warhammer: End Times – Vermintide is a first person action game developed and published by Fatshark who have brought us a few notable titles to Steam over the years such as Bloodsports.TV and War of the Roses. The game was released on PC in October 2015 but is due to be released on PS4 and Xbox One in early 2016.\n\nThe game play is very similar to that of Left 4 Dead. You team up with three other players to battle through stages taking on rodent like creatures, the Skaven. There is also an element of character progression in the terms of equipment. At the end of each stage you get a reward of dice to roll, the better you roll, the higher quality item you get.  Each character has its designated role within the group of playable characters. There is a good mix of range damage dealers, melee and tank characters.  The combat melee system is really well put together, the blocking system in this game is very key to playing a melee character correctly as you will just take too much damage to be beneficial to your party. The mage class does a ton of damage, but also runs the risk of dealing damage to herself through overpowering her magic. I particularly liked the mage class as there is a pretty high skill ceiling between playing the character OK and playing it really really well.  You can play the game single player with bots, but you are going to get the most enjoyment out of playing it in a group of four.\n\nThe visuals in Vermintide are really good. They capture the Warhammer feel and atmosphere perfectly. The animations of all the characters are nicely put together with no weird movement cycles or attack animations. The lighting is extremely well done too as you delve deep into dark parts of the city. There is a loosely connected narrator to the game as well; the narration is done in real time as you reach certain locations on the stage, and this also provokes a reaction out of the party members, each character will react differently to what is happening. I thought this was a nice little addition that breaks up the repetitiveness nature of the game.\n\nEach stage has a variety of different difficulties to play on, the higher the difficulty you play, the better chance you have to get improved loot at the end of a successful run. You can jump straight into doing “Normal” runs, but you will find yourself being severely overwhelmed due to your equipment not being up to par, once you get yourself a decent set of gear you can start jumping into the normal runs and then work your way up from there into the harder difficulties.\n\nThe stages are all nicely designed. It reminds me so much of Left 4 Dead with the layouts and how there is different styles of Skaven enemies to take on. Throughout the stages you will also have the chance to find treasure chests which also can reward you with additional dice for the end of the level, as well as health potions or stat potions.\n\nAt the moment I have been playing Vermintide for just over five hours; I can see myself dipping in and out of the game for a few reasons which I will go on next, but there is a good level of replay ability here. The loot factor being the main element that will keep people coming back; everyone loves getting loot and you will get plenty in this game. The other key factor is the multiplayer/team based, if you can find yourself a group of friends to run stages with, you will find yourself being sucked into this game for hours at a time.\n\nNow, onto the technical issues. First of all, the performance on Vermintide is pretty poor, even when playing on SLI 970s I wasn’t able to push out 4k graphics without sacrificing frame drops. I was happy to drop my resolution down to 1440 whilst also keeping settings on max. The major technical issue I ran into would be random crashes.  Every two runs I did, I would get at least 1 crash throughout, and sadly if you crash, you can’t reload your game and jump straight into the last party. This became very annoying and to the point where I don’t see myself playing this game too much in long stints, I’ll jump in for a run or two here and there, but nothing more than that.\n\nTo sum up, Vermintide is a very good game in thought, and when it works it is absolutely awesome. I really hope they manage to fix the random crashes because this game would be right up my ally. The fact the game has such stellar gameplay which reminds people of an even better game, Left 4 Dead, will do this game huge favours. The game is retailing for £22, 99 on Steam and that is almost as low as it’s been since it was released. I will recommend this game with the premise you get it when on sale, purely because of the technical problems.  If you are lucky enough to get by without having crashes, Vermintide is an awesome game that will give you hours and hours of content.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Warhammer The End Times: Vermintide is in no way a bad game. Well, it shouldn't be at least.\nAs you probably know or guessed, it's a 4 player, CO-OP based game and the comparison with Left 4 Dead or even Payday seems kind of obvious. The main difference with this game is that it's mostly melee based. Well duh, it's based on Warhammer, not 40K.\n\nIt's a pretty good thing really. Feels refreshing and all that.\nNow why am I not recommending this game?\nThing is, I cannot recommend it AT THIS POINT. This might as well evolve in the future and I'll edit my review accordingly, but as of now, I'd say stay away from it and wait for the devs to actually do what they're saying.\n\nThere are a number of issues with Vermintide, I'll try to list all I can think of. First, let me begin with the fact that there are no dedicated servers and that the netcode is absolute garbage, resulting in desync, lag (that can easilly cost you your life) and other happy stuff.\n\n1) Melee. It's a great idea to have a melee based FPS, especially when successfull titles like Shadow Warrior or Dark Messiah opened the way. Problem is, Vermintide seriously lacks feedback in that regard. Most of the time it feels more like you're sweeping wheat than actual Skavens. As a result, you'll often end up taking hits thinking you killed a mob when you missed it, or them, if you aren't careful enough.\n\n2) Distance. Now I know the game is supposed to be melee based so of course, that ain't where it's going to shine, just like how most FPS don't shine on the melee side. Still, the ranged combat aspect could very well use some polishing, with a better feedback for example or, mostly, not having your allies push you as you're aiming. Which brings us to the third problem...\n\n3) CO-OP. Cooperation is vital in this game. More so than in L4D or Payday. The game is unforgiving, and if you leave a team mate behind, you can be sure as hell he's going to die. Problem is, the game severely lacks anything in that sense. Some audio lines telling you that you left a team mate behind could fix that, though the audio could be revamped as well as it's not loud enough. Add the special enemies bugs like the Packmaster pulling you behind houses or the Rat-Ogre sending you all the way down, below buildings, and COOP becomes really tedious.\n\n4) Variety. EDIT OF 11/27/15: Previously, I complained about the fact that we are only fighting rats when Warhammer has such a large story. What I didn't know is, Vermintide is a part of Warhammer lore so it makes sense, as they would have needed to program an entire new AI for new enemies, had they not been rats. However, the point still stands about the lack of variety.\nThe maps are very similar, the objectives are dull and you just end up missing that feeling of satisfaction whenever you complete one, resulting in the farm of the same 2 maps over and over for the loot. It can also be quite tricky to tell a rat from another, including specials, or from a pile of bricks. Everything is grey, it's night time all the time. It's... boring.\n\n5) Equipement and loot system. Great idea in itself. It makes for the replayability, and it's always interesting to get new stuff or customize your gameplay a bit more from just the classes. Problem is, the loot system is totally unrewarding, you end up grinding and grinding never to get the weapon you so want. The fuse system is a good idea, you fuse 5 weapons and you get another one... problem is, the forge works based on the weapons you input. So it's great to get a better quality hammer if you have 5 hammers, but what are you gonna do with all those 1 handed swords? I'd say, give us some more options as to what we can get. Let the players choose which weapons they want, and let the die choose the quality and bonuses. Easy enough fix ain't it?\n\n6) Performance issues, desync and a various set of bugs are common, so beware.\n\nFinally. The game has great promises and I could very well see this becoming as popular as Payday or Left 4 Dead, but certainly not at this point. I'm kind of addicted to it, but god damn am I going to be mad if they don't give that potential gem the polishing it so needs! I'm not exactly sure why the game went out of beta so early... marketing strategy?","November 8, 2015","false","34.7"," 145 of 220 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","145","220","3","15"

These are known as 'exotics'.  Most people will have this as their best gear.\nRed - Very, Very rare.\n\nHow do you get items?\n\nThere are 2 types of basic levels, not sure if they have any 'official' names but for simplicity sake I'll just call them small and normal maps.\n\nSmall maps are maps with short objectives and are relatively easy to play.\n\nNormal maps usually have 3 tomes and 2 'grimores'\n- Tomes:  They take up your third slot which is used for health potions/med kits (and if you press and hold right click you can endlessly annoy your friends and constantly ask them if they have time for the lord jesus christ.\n- Grimores: This is where it gets good.  A grimore takes up the potion slot - but here's the catch.  If you have one grimore, everybody's health bars are cut a 4th.  And if you have 2, it'll 4th it again.  Ultimate risk vs reward.\n\nAt the end of the round you get dice to roll and based on how many tomes/grimores/loot die (random drop from lucky sack rat).  You get better dice with a higher % to roll a loot icon when you roll.  Normal Dice give a 33% chance at a loot icon, I believe the Loot dice give 50% chance, tomes give 66% to show a loot icon and the grimore has 100% chance to show a loot icon.  When you get your first great roll it becomes addicting and it's quite a rush.\n\nSo, please tell me, to the ♥♥♥♥heads that discounted this game so quickly.  Most of you only have not even one hour, can you really, REALLY experience the above, which really sets this game far apart from left 4 dead in so many good ways, in not even an hour?  Here's the answer: Hell no.  You'll spend a lot of time looking for the tome and grim locations and even if you googled it you might have completed one, but you are probably part of the generation that doesnt give a game a fair shot and discount it quickly (probably the same people that will downvote a game because they can't run it because they didn't check their system requirements).  The point of a review is to be helpful, not to look at the face of a game play it for a couple of hours and call it a rip off.\n\nI can think of a few reasons why people would disount this so quickly:\n\n-This game can be challenging\n\n-It requires teamwork (GUARANTEE you at least half of the negative nancies ran off alone)\n\n-There are several other systems in crafting they didn't want to learn/didn't even know they were there (re-rolling traits entirely, re-rolling %'s on them, 'praying' for new exotics with the right currency, ec)\n\n-They have no friends to play this with - and this is a fun game.\n\n\nI hope you took the time to read this, because if you did then you are sitting here looking at these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ negative reviews about 'direct ripoff' and going "I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ you are talking about" like me just because a few of the same type of characters are the same.\n\nThe devs are good people, they are hard working and the content they create is BEAUTIFUL.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeco/recommended/235540/","Coeco","Coe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeco/","270 products in account","WARNING! NONE OF THESE ISSUES HAVE BEEN FIXED AS GAME HAVE NOW BEEN OFFICIALLY RELEASED, PROCEED WITH EXTREME CAUTION!\n\n--\n\nA game that has a series of unfortunate problems, many of them originating from the L4D franchise from which this game has been designed from. Not to say that the core experience makes it a bad game by any means, the melee and gore is very satisfying when It works but there's just too many glaring problems for me to personally enjoy it for more than a few hours at a time and following an incredibly bug-filled release that yet remains to be fixed, the developers have also gone out of their way to mislead the community by announcing how they have such "BIG PLANS" for the game just to utterly STRUGGLE to release the world's weakest DLC including 3 maps, 3 achievments and 2 new weapons (one which is for an already horrendously overplayed character, they've done zero effort to try and balance the 5 that currently exist) that cost 10€ whilst leaving the old maps that are bugged to all hell in the dust with even weaker updates inbetween fixing nothing but crashes that should have been solved at release.\n\nDo NOT buy this stagnating, buggy garbage title. As for the actual game design / mechanical problems, I'm gonna list these now:\n\n\n------------------\n\n1. Melee range of Skaven. These little buggers can be armed with tiny rotten planks barely poking out of their hands and still whack you from over 5 bodylengths away. Mix this with the fact that they can effortlessly hit you through massive chunks of walls (even floors/ceilings) and you got a recipe for frustration. HP is precious like all hell and having huge amounts of it be lost to quite frankly bull sh*t scenarios is a big no-no and these frustrations are only reinforced by the constant clumsy slow-downs all character suffer from before, during and after weapon swings that cannot be alleviated in the slightest even with a potion of speed which breaks the melee combat pacing. To put it in numbers, Skaven are as of right now hitting about 20-60% further away than they should be (depending on the Skaven). Now mix this with some very buggy skaven animations including warping, pushing/stun immunity when climbing, clipping into walls & objects and you're goinna have a bad time.\n\nThis is an issue that has been openly admitted by the developers themselves. One of the leading causes for this is the FOV which makes no attempt whatsoever to adapt melee ranges you perceive above 65 FOV which has for whatever reason been made the standard, an incredibly dumb decision for a melee oriented messy fighting game.\n\n----\n\n2. Hitboxes. Contributing to point 1, the enemy hitboxes in this game are excruciatingly random. They can either be non-existant, allowing you to merge your body with theirs (and have their body physically fade out of existance as they repeatedly hit you) or have 2-3 of the weakest grunts be able to flawlessly box you in at giant open areas. Both scenarios are much unwelcome things to be had in a melee fighter so collission as of right now remains to be a serious problem of not only consistency and flow often breaking up in fights but also managing to nick the weapon balance in the game. If you collide with a teammate, they will get pushed around. If skaven collide with themselves, they will just clip into each-other and form grotesquely durable glitchy meatshields that even I, a main dwarf player struggle to take down with dozens of full power cleaves using a 2h battle-axe. Have just a few common skaven glitch inside of a rat ogre and.. Well.. You're gonna have a bad time.\n\n----\n\n3. Battle Clutter. There are literally hundreds of enemies swarming you from all directions at any given time while you are cramped up together with 3 other friendly melee fighters.. And there is absolutely no indication or outliners whatsoever to help you see amidst the sea of corpses and blood that if the thing you are hitting is a friendly or a non-dead Skaven as all characters currently in the game suffer from "Skaven Lookalike Syndrome" with perhaps only the Empire Soldier being an exception due to his height & shiny plate and decapitated Skaven splurting significant amounts of blood to form an improvised lamp post. When you combine the hitbox clutter from point 2, however, It also becomes increasingly difficult to differentiate between dead, injured and alive Skaven from even moderate attack groups as they all die in dramatic'esque animations & poses before ragdolling onto the ground. This wouldn't be a problem if you could actually have an effect on these animations by say, pushing them away/cancelling them by swinging your weapon into said ragdolls but instead, they all individually have to stand up and have their incredibly frustrating "vision obscuration" sequence before GTFO'ing. There's also an ongoing series of glitches that make Skaven ragdolls stand upright, even when dead which makes this all much more frustrating. But even then, bodies obscure way too much of the screen which forces you (in even moderate fights) to adapt a spam-swinging strategy instead of trying to get a grasp of a situation.\n\n----\n\n4. Loot & Inventory system leaves much to be desired. After my very first run with my friend playing the Soldier, I had the absurd luck to have a blue rare two-handed sword for said Empire Soldier to drop for me as I was playing as a Wizard while my friend got a staff. Could we trade the two things? NNNNNNNNNNnnnnope. Salvage that crap and better luck rolling the loot dice next time. To put it bluntly, It's a zero flexibility 100% RNG loot system that makes no attempt whatsoever to give you loot related to the hero you were playing that run and It's just a giant questionmark for me as to why they would ever consider this to be good design for a co-op RPG released late 2015. It is particularly crippling because there is literally no other customization to be had to for example, make your character stronger or enable him/her to carry more ammo etc.\n\n----\n\n5. Level design. The first map is beautiful with far-reaching scenery and big atmospheric battle-grounds when you're not crunching through blood-soaked urban quarters. After that, however, you're thrown into a series of horribly generic sewer sections that all look identical save for the 2~ gate opening sections. Following the smelly sewers, you're shot right back up into a ginormously downsized version of map 1 that is nothing but the same cramped urban areas where the only even remotely open area at ALL in the entire map is at the end where you have to go and pick up 5 bags of grain, slowly carrying them one by one to a wagon before getting in yourself and finishing all the early access content. This boring trend has continued with the release maps and they all also follow the consensus of being INCREDIBLY buggy, both having you fall down the map on a dozen locations, be dragged outside of it by packmasters and have drastic FPS drops happen consistently.\n\n----\n\n6. The AI. It is either insanely dumb or insanely cheaty & unfair. For the dumb scenarios I've met, I had all the rats at the end of map 1 try to run up the stairs, targeting only my furthest-back teammate and completely ignoring me as I was slaughtering them en-masse by charging up cleave attacks over and over again. They even repeatedly collided with me and didn't give a damn, allowing us to roll through what would've been a challenging fight. I've also had it blatantly SPAM spawn enemy Skavens right infront of our faces nearby an elevator close to a corner, popping them in by the hundreds and causing them to glitch around in eachother and up against the walls which we took advantage of and slaughtered hundreds of them over and over again with ease before It abruptly stopped. This may not be a big deal on a case-by-case basis but It definitely is a cause of worry as the rest of the released game remains to be grossly untested.","October 16, 2015","false","87.3"," 1,503 of 2,475 people (61%) found this review helpful 126 people found this review funny","61","503","2","126","78"

When lagging enemies tend to hit after you defence and some little annoying places enemies hit you through walls and stuff similiar to that. ALSO I forgot something really needs to be changed and it's called Player Hosting. Why it's bad you might ask (as a customer who thinks to buy this game.) answer is simple. When the host player leaves or crashes match/map you are on restarts, this thing really annoys me with a lot of others. Only thing we can do is hoping at this point but I doubt they will change it near future.\n\nAside from game, lore is awesome in general. I mean come on IT'S ♥♥♥♥ING WARHAMMER.\n\nAbout the new DLC maps. (Castle Drachenfels)\nDevelopment team really worked on this one. Map's atmosphere is great, you really feel like you are in a vampire castle. A LOT of new things been added such as a torch to aid you in darkness. New little stuff has been added to with the DLC like pull the lever and boom secret doors open and one of the most fun which is added to the game is traps, there aren't many but pressure plates are really fun to annoy your friends also I think it's possible to push enemies to wall spikes and iron maidens which scattered around the first map. Well when it comes to dark envoirments nothing says we've done it as Warhammer fantasy, vampire lords. Castle Drachenfels is really accurately made in game. My only complain would probably not getting any new enemies aside from that new update added new weapons to the mix such as axes for Waywatcher (Which I still didn't get but saw for now.) and a volley crossbow for Witch Hunter. Overall the new DLC is fun, go grab one or grab an friend who has the DLC and roll with it!\n\nLet's go back to the point. Game is really nice, loot grinding is important for difficulty levels. Teamplay is important. Worths every cent you've spent.\n\n9/10","May 12","true","163.4"," 77 of 114 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","77","114","0","0"

It has optimization issues at times but Fatshark seems to be handling critcial/high issues fairly well for such a small company.\n\nPros:\n-Great melee system - every weapon feels responsive and is different to use.\n-Loot based system that adds replayablity.\n-Really nice graphics that set the mood and atmosphere of a fantasy world on the eve of the end of the world.\n-Five different classes with their own play styles and personalities.   The voice acting is pretty great.\n-Great co-op experience with okayish AI partners.\n-Very challenging game - at least right now on normal.   You will need to have good teamwork and gear to go past Normal.\n-Similar vein to L4D with enough tweaks to make it stand out enough.\n-13 levels at release - the three levels they have in the pre-order beta are enough fun for a few hours though, and each level will have a lot of replaybility thanks to the tomes and grimories, which are optional objectives that will give you better loot if you get to the end with them.\n\nCons:\n-Some odd bugs here and there still with Skaven appearing out of thin air, or through walls.   Nothing majorly breaking with the exception of the now and again crash.\n-Some performance/optimization issues need to be ironed out a bit but I have faith that the devs will get that taken care of.\n\nBottom line is that if you like co-op games, you like L4D or Warhammer Fantasy in general ,you need to buy this game.

The reasoning was that it seemed that the team behind the game was truly committed to fixing the game and adding more content. But after half a year, many of the bugs in the game and performance issues are still a problem. On top of that almost no content was released, with the exception of the Last Stand DLC. The problem with this DLC is that it's just a game mode that rehashes previous maps into an arena. This means that Last Stand was pretty much a lackluster DLC.\n\nWith some severe performance issues, several bugs still present and little content to keep players engaged, the player base has been fading away.\nSo now, I'm changing my review to negative.

I have seen many people praise it for it's good RPG elements, fun and exciting loot, as well as saying there is good class design, saying that they each have their own unique playstyle. No, it BARELY scrapes the surface of being an RPG and each class does not have their own unique playstyle, that is an absolute joke.\n\n\n1. It's a Warhammer game, but it doesn't matter. Warhammer is a deep universe, I expect to be immersed in the world, I expect depth. There's no reason this should be a Warhammer game. It's got no story, no narrative, no lore, no interesting characters. It's got no skills, it's got no classes and the different races of the 'classes' are completely meaningless, and on top of that there is no atmosphere, nothing close to a Warhammer feeling. They copied Left4Dead (to it's detriment) a bit too much, they made all the five playable characters practically identical. The only thing that separates them, is what weapons they use, and many of the classes have very similar weapons. Every playable character has the same HP, same defense, same movement, same dodge, same bashes, etc, the only thing different is what weapon they use. Their race means nothing, their profession means nothing. I expect the Witch Hunter to be unique, I expect the Waywatcher to be unique, because she is an elf and an archer AND this is Warhammer.\n\nPeople say that this game feels like a Warhammer game and captures it's essence in spades. If this blows you away like that, then when Total War Warhammer is released you will have a heart attack.\n\n\n2. The combat is simple but has a bit of depth. The use of bashing to knock down enemies and dodging backwards and to the sides helps the combat feel more involved, but for the most part you are spamming left click with the occasional right click and dodging/bashes. You repeat the same maps over and over. This is to be expected, but it would help if the combat was more interesting. All the good loot based games have skills. Diablo, Torchlight, Path of Exile, Grim Dawn, Borderlands, etc. On top of the skills in these games, they have equips with abilities that have skill changing effects. In Diablo, there are legendaries that extend the use of skills by providing a certain buff to them as well as possibly adding an extra mechanic(s) to that skill, while sets change skills drastically by adding extra mechanics and buffs to even multiple skills. Sets in conjunction with certain legendaries as well as certain skills make for many unique playstyles with many mechanics. All of these games have skills, all of them have unique weapons and armor. Warhammer Vermintide ONLY has weapons and they are boring. Nothing unique about them. There is a bow called a true flight bow. It aimbots the enemies head for you. That's as far as it goes.\n\nTraits are pretty much the closest thing that can make your weapons unique. They are abilities on your weapon, but they don't change much, they are boring. "Heal some hp on hit, 3%-10% chance.", "3% chance to instantly slay any sized enemy on charged attack hit.", "% chance on kill to recover 20% ammunition for your ranged weapon."\n\nPyromancer is the only 'class' with anything unique about them. They have a heat meter, and you use your staff to do devastating AOE fire blasts. The more you do and the longer your charge these attacks, the quicker you charge up your heat meter, and when it's full you gotta cooldown. This is better than nothing. It just sucks because it is pretty much a disadvantage to have.\n\nYou don't want to add skills? That is fine, but add something. Make weapons have abilities, make races have special traits, release some passives into the game so there is SOME diversity. COME ON, anything. Passives would be fine, along with weapon abilities. When I get an orange item, I want it to be epic. All it is, is a slightly better blue, but much harder to get. I want it to be special.\n\nSome of the trinkets have decent effects. "60% less damage taken from gas clouds", "15% chance to not use a consumable on use", "When reviving, you cannot be interrupted". These are the most radical effects in the game. This is Warhammer, the universe where moons are brought down from orbit with magic, but this is the best they can do. Weapons with effects like an AOE blast after you have done enough damage with the weapon or something is lore fitting and completely balanced.\n\n\n3. Progression. There is like none. The only thing to do in the game is to get loot, very lackluster loot. There are three equipment slots, technically. Melee weapon, ranged weapon and three trinket slots. WHY NO ARMOUR? Because they want every character to have the exact same HP and defense. There are cosmetic helmets. Regardless, you will spend a ton of time trying to get the perfect loot for one 'class', let alone all five, but that's not the point. It's a lot of effort to get the good loot from missions. Doing long missions on hard-nightmare with two grimoires and three tomes is no joke, it is hard, especially in public games. It's a big commitment and failing it, which will happen, is very demoralizing and time consuming, and you get nothing for your time spent if you do fail, even at the end. When you do succeed, you will most likely get a blue. If you do get an orange, most likely it's not for a 'class' you play, or you already have it. If you do get the one you want, it doesn't really mean much, and actually, if you do get the one you want, great, that's all the content for you, end game has been reached. What now? No skills, no cool effects, very lackluster and boring stats in game being extremely black and white with absolutely no diversity or depth. I have 6 oranges, so that's three of my classes geared to the teeth. I have no reason to play the game now really. I have nice weapons and getting an upgrade would require a massive amount of luck and time spent, time which I have absolutely no desire in committing in the hopes of getting a very minimal upgrade, while I actually just end up getting all blue items and a few orange items which are completely useless because I've already reached the dam end game. What's the point? There is no progression.\n\nI guarantee you, that this game is in it's honeymoon phase. I doubt many people will get over 100 hours of this game before they quit. Unless the devs drastically add end game content and more progression systems and maybe enhance the combat, I do not see this game having a significant player base in the near future. I thought I was going to play this game for a while, all of my friends thought so too, but that is not the case. DLC's with extra maps and more weapons won't cut it, not unless they are unique and different.\n\n\n4. Buggy as hell. From the Devs who brought you War of the Roses and War of the Vikings. It seems they are taking this seriously. They did however abandon War of the Vikings.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nI don't think this genre, first person survival where every character is forced to be equal is good for a loot based game because since every character is completely equal, the combat has to be simple and the same for every 'class', making grinding very repetitive and boring. This game also does not feel like a Warhammer game. If they add some way to diversify yourself more in the game, be it skills, passives or weapon effects, it would help greatly. I think all of the five 'classes' should have something unique about them other than the weapons they can equip.","October 27, 2015","false","34.9"," 150 of 245 people (61%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","61","150","245","9","18"

One of the best games i've ever played, until recently suffering updates that focused massively on removing mechanics that helped the players instead of also focusing in fixing the glitches that ruin the game. This company has also failed to meet it's deadlines, it seems like that they spent too much time something that was broken, but fun in it's own unique way, instead of actually adding promissed content.\n\nPlease be aware that this is a review from somebody who solely plays on cataclysm, if you play on another difficulty please don't bother.\nNow let's talk about the balancing and debugging.\n-They have now removed block revive, which was a strong and vital part of the game, if you go down on cataclysm during a horde, you are bound to die, unless all of your teammates have distraction on their weapons, this did not use to be the case, the block revive used to be a counter part glitch that helped the players to the overwhelming ammount of glitches that sought out to punish the players (i.e. rats hitting through walls, under the floor, or through the ceiling).\n\nSo if you decide to remove a glitch that actually was a good mechanic in the game, why not also remove one of the most hated and frustrating bugs in your game? It does not add up.\n\nWeapon variety is a joke, specially on the wizard, who only used the beam staff which now got ridiculously nerfed, making her virtually useless, i won't even mention the other staffs, even after the buffs, they are still a punch in the gut to the players.\nDid you know crossbows existed?\nDid you know the Witch hunter had an axe?\nDid you know the Captain can use a 1 handed sword and prettend to be the wizard?\nDid you know Kerillian has a shortbow?\nKerillian can use a single sword, why?\n\nThis.Is.A.Joke\n\nNow, on to the specials\n\nGlobadiers - Globe rat resistance has been nerfed shortly (90%-60%) after massively buffing the globadiers. This has resulted in situations where if you have a horde and a globadier that you cannot spot, you are already wiped, and even if you do spot him, goodluck using your handgun to headshot a small, glitchy head in the middle of the horde, because they are just that tanky.\n\nPrevious to the nerf, globe rats still spammed enough globes and poison to the point of seriously injuring the players, but giving them a chance to survive a situation you are cornered in.\nContinuing on this trinket, it seems fatshark forgot the purpose of these trinkets, you have a maximum of 3, and on cataclysm, you do need the grimoire resistance, or you get 1 shot by a rat that will hit you through shove, or through the wall. You also need poison resistance, or once you have both grims, the sheer impact of the globe would kill you instantly. And then you have the choice of another trinket. So all this "great variation of gameplay" brought by trinkets are a massive joke, even more so now, where you waste a trinket slot to deal with a specific kind of special rat, and it won't even do that anymore.\n\nPackmasters - Ah yes, the ghosts of vermintide, ethereal beings that are imune to unit collision, marching towards you during a horde, ignoring every rat possible, grabing you through all the rats or a wall and draging you to a death that is certain, even if your team is around, best case scenarion would be to go down, and helped by your team during the horde by block reviv... oh wait..\n\nAfter 300 hours playing this game, i have defended it constantly and passionately from its critics, but update after update i have become more and more tired and disapointed in the direction this game is taking.","March 5","false","295.8"," 45 of 67 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","45","67","3","2"

A fun and enjoyable warhammer universe title.\n\nPros\n+ Graphics and details in the game are fine, each map is detailed nicely and unique to thier own.\n+ The banthers between the characters is enjoyable to listen to.\n+ The different heroes you can play each with thier own unique weapons and range weapons\n+ The challenge and teamwork behind Nightmare and Cataclysm mode. You can have amazing gear but at cataclysm the game will absolutely ♥♥♥♥ you.\n+ Getting that amazing dice rolls when it happens and if it happens.\n+ The animations behind the skaven and where they come from, the holes in walls, from gutters in the ground and cracks Like true rats.\n+The memories and fun between different players you will meet.\n+ The amount of time you will spend on the game for the value spent rolling the dice and praying to rngesus\n\n\nCons - The hitboxes and model you make hits feels awkward. Takes you a bit of time to get use to so most people who play this end up swinging all over the place. Most of the time it hits where you want it but doesn't feel as fluid as other melee games out today.\n- The game needs tweaking with certain mobs such as the PACK MASTER who is able to pull players through floor and even from top of cieling that i've seen.\n-Host migration on server isn't great, A person may crash, leave the game or whatever reasons and the game restarts the map. Hopefully FS will look into dedicated servers\n- Your bots can be geared to what you want it to be but they are incredibly stupid and require some sort of bot commands. Ie will raise you from the ground while skavens are beating up your team causing you to lose or run off on thier own against special mobs.\n- The Levels do nothing in terms of the searches. It is just prestiege in a way to show how long you've been playing. A level 1 can join your game of nightmare or cataclysm if they wanted and ruin it\n- Trolls can kick during a match at the end of the round or even disconnect on your game right before you finish for the lols.\n- It is hard to find players for the hardest difficulty cataclysm and probabaly non existent since the challenge is too much for some. Need more content to keep the players going.\n\n\nThe inbetweens- You will either hate/love the loot table. What you get and the dice rolls RNG. if you want better chances find tomes and grimoires\n- Some maps have issues and exploits that needs to be fixed. Some people will want to do them legit but it is hard to find the people to do so since everyone wants easy loot.\n- Some veterans and elite players have no patience for new players, best to host your own game or move on if you find these players and not everyone in the community is toxic as they say.\n- Cheaters/hackers/exploiters won't ever get punished in this game but then again they are hurting noone except themselves. unfortunately it also makes it harder for the community of players to find serious games.\n\nYoutube Review https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCmn5QTr7VA","October 29, 2015","true","109.7"," 51 of 78 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","51","78","4","4"

And for good reason, it feels similar, with 4 players going through levels to do a goal and then escape again. So then is this L4D with a Warhammer sauce all over it? Not quite. With the focus on melee weaponry as limited ammo and reloading times makes sure you can't just shoot everything before it becomes a threat, it is more about moving as a group and managing your swinging and blocking to not get hit too often. Where zombies are stupid and mostly mindless, the skaven (Ratmen for those not into Warhammer) have enough inteligence to actively try to flank you, as well as staying at a distance to avoid the swing of your weapon. Best of all, they will insult you as you fight.\n\nThere are more differences, of course, such as multiple characters with different abilities and equipment. None of these seem too strong, or too weak, and it is mainly a matter of playstyle who you end up prefering. The controls themselves are right about what they should be and feel fluid, with it being mostly about your skill at the game rather than what equipment you have. Netcode seems to work well, and I have had no difficulties playing together with friends on other continents. Gameplay overall is very solid, and with a good group you'll be able to pull a lot of enjoyment out of Vermintide.\n\nSome things are slightly less amazing though. Though improved in early december, the loot system remains nearly entirely chance based. You might not ever get a rare quality version of the weapon you want, no matter how long you play or how much you try. This becomes incredibly frustrating and has led to people repeatedly doing the same mission over and over for another chance at the one weapon they actually want, neglecting missions that are not loot-optimal.\n\nThe developer seems to listen to the community and there are plans for more things to be added. That said, in the end Vermintide is a great game. It looks like it has a bright future with more content ahead, even if it already has all it needs to keep you entertained for hours.","December 17, 2015","true","70.1"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","24","31","0","0"

If that elevator pitch was all you gave me, I'd pass. Left 4 Dead is fun but I've played it. I generally know what it does and what it's capable of. And FPS melee systems tend to feel clumsy and bolted on. So why mess with what works?\n\nBut Vermintide has so much more to offer. Character progression and loot give you something to keep playing for, even if you do master the mechanics right away. (You won't.)  It fleshes out character roles in a softer, more subtle way than a bright-line class system. For example, the Bright Wizard is built around ranged damage more than other heroes, but everyone can fight at a distance, and sometimes the situation calls for a sturdy rifle or a poisoned arrow more than a bolt of flame. The Dwarf and Imperial Soldier look like the obvious melee specialists, with their weapon selection that affords more crowd control, stronger shoves, and more durable blocks. But some teammates' weapons will let them dance in and out of combat, popping armored enemies in the head with more efficiency than the brawlers. This kind of soft specialization is fun, and hopefully DLC will add some more options that contest with a few characters' almost-mandatory gear picks.\n\nCombat is meaty, weighty, and satisfying. You can stand around and click on everything that comes under your crosshair, but it won't carry you far past "Normal" difficulty. Weapons have different arcs and patterns they swing in, different stats on swing speed, damage, amount of targets hit, different pushback, etc., and all those stats have different values on charged attacks, which you can pop off at a reasonable clip. Mix that with regenerating stamina that you can spend on blocks and shoves and you've got a system with a lot of depth. A Cataclysm-difficulty Rat Ogre might kill 5 or 6 teams of new players simultaneously if you could arrange that fight, but a solitary player with a mastery of the mechanics could solo that monster. You probably won't ever be *that* good, and you don't have to be to play at a high level, but it's a good example of just how much Vermintide will reward you for the time you put into it.","January 23","true","226.2"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

If you live in Asia/SEA region, it's best to give it a pass unless you already have reliable friends who's going to play with you.\n\nStatistically, the game lobby lists ~70% as US games, the rest mostly EU. Asian players make up <5% of the 300-500 active players during peak hours.\n\nI have seen too many players buy the game and give up quickly because they have no one to play with, which was one of the reason I created a steam group for our region and remained active for quite a while.\n\nThe game itself is extremely fun and challenging. The survival of the players depend heavily on team cohesiveness and communication which adds another layer of enjoyment. It can get overwhelming and frustrating in pick up groups without this layer for the loner player.\n\nDue to the reserved culture/nature of Asian players, initiatively opening up to players through VOIP is not common, hence the game doesn't thrive in our region.\n\nTL:DR\nThe game failed to establish a foothold outside of US and EU. No point wasting money to buy since the game is dead in Asia/SEA region.","March 13","false","380.4"," 30 of 43 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","30","43","5","2"

I make the comparison early because the similarities are obvious and abundant. Fat Shark have taken Valve/Turtle Rock’s design for the popular zombie-killing franchise and transplanted it into the Warhammer universe, borrowing level design and objective ideas, pacing, UI elements, enemy types and the mechanic of the ‘AI director’ who changes enemy and item placements and types when replaying levels. Even the way the camera pans around at the start of each level before zooming in behind the players is done in exactly the same way as Left 4 Dead. However despite the myriad similarities, there are a few crucial differences that set it apart enough that is shouldn’t necessarily be labeled as a lazy rip-off.\n\nThe biggest thing differentiating Vermintide from that other series is the clear emphasis on melee combat. Your primary weapon will be a sword, hammer, axe, mace or some other object designed to cut, bludgeon, or crush your furry opponents. The melee focus isn’t surprising given the developer’s background with War of the Roses and War of the Vikings, and the combat system in Vermintide is a good one, though not perfect.\n\nWhat is a problem is the poor optimization. The game looks good, with nice textures and lighting bringing the environments to life and imbuing many with thick atmosphere, but during the already messy large combat encounters, the frame rate tends to tank. Even when lowering the settings considerably things would slow down on many levels on my reasonably powerful PC. For this reason, I would advise those with weaker systems to give this game a miss, at least until it has seen some patches to help improve optimization.\n\nRead Full Review [www.newgamenetwork.com]","November 5, 2015","true","9.7"," 38 of 59 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","38","59","2","0"

I could wax lyrical about how amazing this game is, but everyone's already done this for me.\n\nInstead, this review will address on the major negative aspects of the game. It's still recommended, but this is to give newcomers a glance at what they might get frustrated by, without being marked as a negative review. At the moment of writing, I've played this verson for 100+ hours, with 30 hours in the closed beta as well. I should know what I'm talking about.\n\nTOO LONG WON'T READ\nPeople obsess over loot, force you to play with 75/50 HP unless you assert yourself, FPS will tank above medium even on a good rig, there are annoying visual glitches, the AI can be stupid and/or get stuck (enemies and allies), no dedicated servers AS OF YET.\n\nNow into detail.\n\nLOOT OBSESSION\nThis is divisive as hell. Some people say the loot system is bad, because it takes ages to get anything good. Some people say the loot system is bad, because you can get good items in your first 20-30 hours. Some people say the loot system is bad, because it encourages you to play too much of the same character. I ain't getting into that (if you're interested, I'm of the second conviction).\n\nThe thing is, the people playing this game took less than a week to start obsessing with loot and nothing but loot. It isn't an absolute pandemic as some would have you believe, but it's spreading. Not to turn into a tutorial, but there are items called Grimoires in this game, up to 2 per big mission, each eats away 25% of everyone's life for good. They give much better loot rolls at the end. And the higher the difficulty, the better the loot at the end has a chance of being. What this basically means is that if you play Normal pubs, you'll have a good chance of having to deal with tryhards that force you into at least one even if you don't want to. If you play Hard, it's almost a 100% certainty. If you play Hard+ pubs, you're eating ♥♥♥♥ for Christmas, because that's when people refuse to not play with 50% HP on a difficulty where a regular rat downs you in less than 10 hits, 100 to 0.\n\nBasically? You'll have to suffer far more difficulty than you'd like if you play the higher difficulties. And yes, this does mean that some people are absolute shiteaters and refuse to play unexploitable maps, but this isn't as big of a problem. If you host a high difficulty game on a rarely played map, people who have been sick of this trend are very likely to quickly join in. Assuming this isn't one of those days when all people know is Horn of Magnus, even though ♥♥♥♥ has been fixed.\n\nFPS TANKAGE\nYou need a very good CPU to run this one well, or else you're stuck with Medium - FX issues may have been solved, but it still doesn't handle a lot of characters on-screen very well. You can have a slightly outdated GPU, but you want a good quad-core processor. If not, very big fights WILL make the game go to about 10 FPS. Especially with complex lighting. I have a really bad CPU, so this happens to me even on Medium, and often.\n\nThis has been being fixed, and right now the worst is kind of over - having a WH with pistols or playing as the Bright Wizard no longer keeps you in 20 FPS land forever.\n\nVISUAL GLITCHES\nQuite a few, but none of them are gamebreaking. Rats can stretch unnaturally if you hit them with a blunt weapon or shoot them with a bow in the head, at some points you can see the outside of the map through an untextured bit, some of them aren't drawn properly (but you can't tell without zooming right into them), and certain NVIDIA GPU's can really warp the game. Rat fur also turns luminescent on low shadow settings.\n\nAudio glitches are present, too. Some character voicelines are mis-assigned (they think that incapped teammates are legit dead, and tell you to stand still while healing even though that mechanic has been changed a while ago), and some music and sound effects may cut out if you play for too long, leaving you with just the general combat sounds and music. In the middle between audio and visual are subtitles that can be wrong, have typos in them, or stick and never fade. Seriously, just turn them off, unless you aren't a native speaker, this isn't a L4D sort of thing where the subtitles give away specials either anyway. They have been being fixed, but the advice holds.\n\nTHE AI\nThis is probably the second biggest problem after the whole grimoire thing. Sometimes it's just infuriating. Whenever something warps their minds, they'll stand in place, waiting for something, and your only choice will be to run on ahead and hope they teleport to you. Enemies can sometimes get stuck in terrain, Packmasters and Rat Ogres in particular (you'll be thanking the devs for that on higher difficulties). Ratling Gunners also cause some issues with the bot AI, killing them becomes top priority no matter what - at least they don't get shot anymore. Bots also can't pick up potions or bombs, even though L4D came out 7 freaking years ago. Some maps are very very VERY difficult to do with bots, too.\n\nAgain, this is something that's been worked on, and it is also something that went from utterly broken to borderline acceptable. You really don't want to know what bots were like in the closed beta.\n\nNO DEDICATED SERVERS\nPlain and simple, you're at the whims of whoever is hosting, and if YOU are hosting, you can cause your teammates a lot of lag if you don't optimize your connection. Naturally, if the host leaves, the game poops over. You can see how that can be a problem, there's no explanation required. The devs have stated that dedicated servers will be a thing.\n\nEdited with the recent big patch.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/2spaced/recommended/235540/","2spaced","Spaced","http://steamcommunity.com/id/2spaced/","319 products in account","Positives:\nCore gameplay is very satisfying. Combat has real weight. Hearing the crunch of a dozen rats at the end of a warhammer never quite loses its charm.\nAdding loot progression to the L4D formula is a good idea and encourages repeat play. Getting a nice weapon with the trait you wanted is the perfect cherry on top of a smooth run.\nItem and class variety is meaningful if a bit limited. Weapons excel in certain roles but not everything. Upgrades are desirable but not so powerful as to create a gulf between the haves and have-nots.\nLots of quirkiness to the combat that's enjoyable to discover (excel documents wee!)\nLobby system where you can run around and act like a jerk to the innkeep by smashing up all his ♥♥♥♥ while waiting for your teammates.Negatives:\nLoot system is not well thought out. Most items are obsolete before you get them and you'll be getting a LOT of them. You'll likely unlock three trinket slots before ever seeing one in a loot roll. Rerolling items is tedious, expensive, and frustrating. The whole system is just clunky.\nDon't pick this up expecting to have a fun time with bots. While competent enough to get you through a map on the two lower difficulties, they quickly become liabilities everywhere else. You can play this way but it's far from the best experience.\nLikewise, playing with random players can be a total crapshoot. The game isn't terribly difficult, but it's punishing to new players and one bad player can take a whole team down with them.\nBugs! Insta-death for picking up a health potion. Invisible rats hitting you. Shy Rat Ogres that spawn but fail to show up. They don't happen every run, but they happen often enough to be a concern.\nPrepare to play Horn of Magnus over and over again. Its simplicity and easy to learn tome locations make it a favorite to grind for loot. With the relatively small player base, you'll probably play this one a good five times more than any other map. The devs stated they are planning a quest system to encourage greater diversity in map play, but no ETA yet.I enjoyed my time with it, but it wasn't without its frustrations. I'd love to see another iteration of this game with a better loot system and more variety of classes/weapons. Whether that's this game after a few more big patches or Vermintide 2 we've yet to see.","April 12","true","71.8"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

Slight FPS drops at certain non-key locations of various maps (ex: when looking at a caged rat mid level of the Wizard tower map) - nothing to fuss about.\n\n\nCons:\n- Insufficient maps. Game get's boring really quick. I'll play maybe 1-2 maps a day and then quit for the day.\n- Multiplayer/Matchmaking needs some refining. Sometimes you could sit there searching for a game for a long time.\n- Bots were given Artificial Stupidity instead of Artificial Intellignece. Game is really not geared for solo play.\n- Ability upgrades on items are not very diverse and you can't tell in game - for most item attributes - when they "proc"\n- Pretty confident that the rolling system is rigged to keep the rolls low so people could keep playing for those item upgrades (even if you get the bonus dice). This system is actually very frustrating. 50+ hours of play and I think I've rolled a handful of times over a 3.\n- Host-switching is not available - as such, if you are playing a map and the host leaves, the map resets... Yes.. even if you're seconds away from the end (I'd classify this as the biggest flaw of the game).\n- Lack of in-game options (Graphics mainly).\n\nHopefully, they'll adopt CD Prokekt Red's example and release some free content (maps) to add more life to this game since in it's current state you only need a few hours of play after completing the game to move on to another game.\n\nWould upvote the game if they fix the host-switching, rigged rolls RNG, and add more content via patches (not paid DLCs).","November 1, 2015","false","59.7"," 123 of 219 people (56%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","56","123","219","13","7"

Made by fans and not just for profit. This game definately falls into the latter category.\n\nThe game plays like a Fantasy version of Left for Dead. For instance instead of the Tank you get the Rat Ogre, instead of pills a health potion etc. This is obviously more focussed on melee combat though due to the setting. It seems to work really well with Skaven (Rat Men for the uninitiated) replacing the infected.\n\nIt is obviously better with friends and the different rarity of items that drop after each level completion make the game have a high replay value.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SynthiaVice/recommended/235540/","SynthiaVice","Synthia Vice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SynthiaVice/","271 products in account","A really gorgeous-looking game that sadly has little replay value. As much as I wanted to like this game, I just can't; every match turns into a long, drawn-out slog for almost no gain whatsoever. Item drops are little more than a chance at getting a few (read: one) trivial item for a class you don't use. There is virtually nothing that will propel you to do this more than a few times. A friend explained that "the better stuff appears at Nightmare difficulty". And what exactly is the motivation to waste that much time and effort when even normal difficulty is a massive pain in the proverbial derriere? None whatsoever. Instead of wasting my time futilely trying to wrench more satisfaction out of this game, I'll take the developer's electrodes off my nutsack and play something else. This could have been a really fun game; as it is, it's Left 4 Dead: Warhammer Edition with sub-par loot mechanics, less guns, weaker weapons, and more infuriating enemies. You can jump about as high as a dachshund wearing lead booties. You can't even sprint, which more often than not results in your death or the deaths of your teammates (or vice versa) as you are dragged off by yet another Taskmaster, because your character putters along as fast as a geriatric in rush hour traffic. The AI is a joke, as enemies often stand around idly and do nothing, even when they do notice you. They then proceed to fly into action and run around aimlessly before mobbing you. The levels are horribly repetitive; even L4D2 moved the items and objectives around a little more.\n\nI had hoped the last update would improve the game, and while it does fix some of the previous problems, and at least *attempts* to make drops and gaining gear better, it just doesn't fix the one glaring issue: it just isn't fun. And that's to say nothing of the incredible resource draw on your machine due to a distinct lack of optimization; I can play games like Battlefield 4 on maximum settings with no lag, and this runs like my processor is a Pentium 386. I might change my opinion later on, if they update it some more and polish it further, but as is, I can't recommend this game. It's incredibly boring.\n\n5/10\n\nEDIT: I've had to update this review again to mention the slew of incredibly rude comments (now deleted for obvious reasons) I've gotten on said review. One person even decided to post "your a ♥♥♥♥♥" (sic). Wow...really? Is that the sort of people this game attracts?

It means more of the same... or does it? The strong focus on melee is what sets this game apart from its cousin. The combat is fast, frantic and great fun. It also features a basic level up and loot system to keep you playing and unlock better gear. It's a welcome addition - and is not overdone like so many other co-op focussed games, meaning a level 1 can quite happily play with a level 20 with no issues in over/underlevelling. It's great that it is done this way, since you don't require all your friends to be at the same level as you (a common problem with games such as PayDay and Borderlands).\n\nTeam-play is essential, just like L4D where wondering alone is a sure-fire way of getting yourself killed quickly. It also looks gorgeous and some of the level design is superb. The missions are a welcome addition to the standard "run to the exit" formula and make the game even more enjoyable.\n\nCharacter classes are also extremely well done, with a nice variety of play-styles and even the option to further customise the classes to suit the way you like to play.\n\nAl-round, it's a great co-op game that I would recommend to anyone interested in games like L4D.\n\nJimbo Rating: 8/10","January 4","true","19.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

(Pretty sure that's well-known at this point though) There is a simple 4 party setup (there are 5 characters to choose from, each with different weapons) along with 'specials' that do an assortment of different things that are also relatable to the specials in Left 4 Dead. Teamwork is essential, as you fight your way through the waves of enemies that are randomly thrown at you. (Of course, some are scripted however.) There are even little missions throughout each map such as placing barrels or sacks, defending wards or breaking supports. Each of these missions break up the -potential- repetition of the gameplay, and are a welcome thing in my eyes.\n\nNow I have lots and lots of wonderful things to say for this game. It's like it was made just for me. I love the merciless killing of clanrats, I love kiting rat ogres when I'm the last alive and I love most of all getting those 3 tome, 2 grimoire and loot die successful runs. I even, in a sick way, enjoy the runs where I throw a bomb, manage to hit a wall and wipe our entire party... though others might not quite see the funny side as much as I do. I also enjoy grinding loot, although I know a lot of people are complaining about that.. but for me it gives the game a little something extra to work with.\n\nThere is a lot more to this game than simply fighting waves of rats though, once you go to the higher difficulties, it's encouraged that you have a satisfactory knowledge of the game and decent gear. There comes a point when you can have your own assigned role for certain things, such as tanking or headshotting specials, crowd control etc. I've not played enough to know too much about it but this aspect definitely appeals to me. The game is definitely a better experience with premade parties and/or voice communication. I definitely recommend turning voip on, even if you don't have a microphone.\n\nHere are just a couple of things I think could be worked on however. For the most part, spawns are hidden quite well.. but there have been quite a few encounters where the rats spawn right infront of me. I'm hoping somewhere down the line they will tweak this. Another issue I have is with the exotic loot. As much as I like the loot system, there is nothing to be done with exotic loot, as you can't simply merge it. I also think that numerous exploits need to be fixed. I know that one of the big exploits on Horn of Magnus is due to be fixed next week and I can't wait for that. For me those just cheapen the experience for other players. One final thing that bothers me is the optimisation (or rather lack of) for the game. The CPU-Usage is crazily high, as well as the fps fluctuating at an alarming rate. Again, this is supposedly going to be worked on, but who knows when it'll be adjusted.\n\nTL;DR\n+ Slay the rats\n+ Kill your friends with bombs\n+ 10/10 replayability\n+ Nice graphics\n+ HOLY SIGMAR, BLESS THIS RAVAGED BODY\n\n- Needs something to do with exotic loot\n- Exploits need fixing\n- Fix visibility of rat spawns\n- Not much lore (though it's not really lore focused.)\n- Bots currently ignore the ♥♥♥♥ out of you when you're downed.\n- Badly optimised.\n- IF YOU WANT TO CRASH REPEATEDLY WHILE PLAYING, OVERCLOCK YOUR SYSTEM.","November 10, 2015","true","73.9"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","20","30","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/izlain/recommended/235540/","izlain","Izlain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/izlain/","230 products in account","I missed the Left 4 Dead train as it left the station.\n\nL4D2 was my first experience with the series. I played through it once and didn't ever go back. This game has a similar concept in that you'll run through a mission with 4 players (bots will fill in for missing people but they suck) who each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Many comparisons have been made between the two games, but I thought I'd specify that I have little experience with the L4D series, while still acknowledging the similarities.\n\nGameplay is tight. Overall the game runs smoothly; things work as you would expect, and there aren't any drops in framerate even while streaming. The melee combat is visceral. Swinging an axe feels as it should. Blocking with a shield and then swinging it at your attackers to knock them down is very satisfying. Rapiers are quick and nimble. 2-handed weapons are slow yet powerful. This isn't rocket science, but it feels right. Ranged combat is equally tight control-wise, but seems less effective in most cases. Crossbows are slow to reload, but pistols/shotguns and long bows feel much better. The ranged abilities coming from staves are very effective at range.\n\nThe variety of Skaven is nice. Not only are there differing skins for the regular grunts, there are various types that are bigger and badder than their normal counterparts. Fighting a Rat Ogre for the first time was a magical experience. The armored Stormvermin come in packs and are tough to take down. The gunners, hook rats and assassins are a pain in the ♥♥♥, as are the poison cloud creating globe-throwers. There's no lack of challenge either. Normal difficulty still takes its toll, and the hard difficulty is almost too hard, at least at the lower levels with crappy gear. But there's a couple of extra difficulty levels that I haven't even seen yet, so there's going to be plenty of replay value in this game.\n\nAs is common with most first person shooters of this era, you have a global experience level. The interesting bit here is that it's not tied directly to any of the game's five classes, so you don't have to level each individually. Each level you're rewarded with some gear, but each time it's for a different class, so none are completely left out. Also, when completing a level, there is a dice game where you get the chance to earn better gear. The devs chose to keep with the traditional Diablo/MMO formula of color coding rarity, and so far the best I've come up with is a some blues. Each time you level or dice roll, the gear can end up being for any of the classes, so that's a nice way of avoiding an annoying individual grind. Gear is primarily weapons, though there are slots for trinkets, and you can change out your helmet, though I haven't seen any of these drop just yet. You can also find extra loot dies and collect tomes for extra dice that will help with your end-of-level rolls. At the very least, this system gives quite a bit of replay value if you're the sort that wants to completely kit out your characters (I am).\n\nAfter each level and dice game, you'll have the option to vote for what comes next. You can replay the same level, move onto the next or go back to the Red Hook Inn, where you start your journey in the first place. Here you can access your inventory (swap out weapons and gear) the mission map (where you can choose which level to play next) and access the forge - a powerful tool. The forge allows you to fuse, upgrade and disassemble items. Fusing requires five items of the same quality, and combines them into one item of the next quality up (5 whites = 1 green and so on). Weapons earned from the dice game often have locked traits that you can unlock in the forge, upgrading the weapon with passives. These upgrades require essences earned by disassembling items. It's a basic system but it works well and I have seen some decent stuff come out of it.\n\nThe recent free DLC "Sigmar's Blessing" has also added a shrine and new trinkets so that you can "pray" for new items using the colored tokens you get from breaking down unused gear. You can be specific and choose melee or ranged weapons, and the particular character you want the gear for. This helps cut down on the grind a bit, and is particularly nice if you only play one or a couple of the characters with any regularity.\n\nOverall, I love the game. It's been compared to Left 4 Dead, and I can say that it has a similar feel, though these small systematic upgrades give it a better replay value than L4D did, and the devs have already stated that more levels and classes are yet to come. I'll be playing and talking about this game for a while to come.","December 16, 2015","true","19.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Yes Vermintide is the same in that the basic mechanics for surviving (and reviving) and working as a group are there, how to take down different types of enemies that may even be similar to enemies in LFD as well.  Both have tanks, spitting, leaping , tackling and dragging enemies and tons of plain cannon fodder types. Both have an overall atmosphere that they have nailed perfectly , but that is where the differences start to shine.\nFirst off in LFD you are generally crapping your pants through most of it and the feeling of being hopelessly screwed but maybe possibly making it if you tread lightly and carefully and play from a survivalist aspect, which of course is perfect for its horror setting. Never in LFD though have I watched other players in battle and been in awe of what I saw.\nI don't know how many times in Vermintide I have been in situations when I kind of paused to soak in the fight going on around me and stood in wonder at the sheer level of bad-assery I was priviledged to. Part of that comes down to the fact that while LFD was primarily shooting and melee was only secondary, in Vermintide just the opposite is true and the combat mechanics are designed to reflect it. It definitely adds  to the feeling of being super powerful that the game theme wants you to have.  The first day I played and got a real feel for the combat mechanics and who my favorite characters and weapons were, I must have repeated five times in every match "This is so F#%ing cool!"\nWhere Vermintide differs completely is that it uses a loot system that utilizes forging, enchanting and upgrading for your drops.(Which has been greatly overhauled since launch for the better apparently)\n\nBought this at the winter sale but unlike me I would actually recommend paying full price for this game, it's worth every damn penny and the devs seem to be pretty keen on continued support.\n\nIf you're a LFD fan, get it!\nIf you're a Warhammer fan, get it!\nIf you like Warhammer and are into LFD games, you don't even have a choice.","January 24","true","36.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

But I wasn't sold on it, wasn't sure the gameplay was actually good as Skyrim really put a damper on my enthusaism for a first-person hack and slash game.\n\nNow over a hundred hours later, with many laughs with three groups of friends who I regularly play with at work lunches, weekends and during evenings, it's clearly taking the cake as my favorite co-op game.\n\nThe voice acting and characters are interesting and have a story to them that makes me curious about the Warhammer setting I had not cared for at all before. The combat mechanics are easy to understand but hard to master, and you'll notice yourself improve as you play, blocking blows and looking out for your teammates becoming easier over time. The theme of the world is wonderfully coherent in its design and gritty, a perfect counterbalance to the often cheerful banter between the player characters.\n\nI hope Fatshark can keep this game profitable for a long time, so we can enjoy more of this in the future.\n\nNow, to mention a few negatives I'd have to say they've made a poor system for newcomers as of this moment (dec 2015). The community travels upward to higher difficulty settings as they continue to play, so unless there's an influx of new players like during a sale, they will most likely find themselves struggling to find a group that can tolerate them on a difficulty they are comfortable with.\n\nIt's something Fatshark should be wary of and something a new player should expect to some degree. It's fixable by simply shifting reward incentives somewhat, so hopefully they'll address it in a patch in the near future.\n\nIn addition, if you are playing the game solely for the gear, get ready to feel underwhelmed at the end of games. The game rewards you fairly well and there are fallback systems that lets you redeem a bad reward (especially after the Blessings of Sigmar DLC), but its by no means overly generous or controllable. It's a game of dice (literally), and if you are the kind who want nothing more than to perfect your gear then it will take time. However, for me personally I'm glad that there are goals around 130 hours in, and although I don't have the optimal setup just yet I know I can at least play for my own amusement and maybe get the fated Veteran tier handgun.\n\nSo, all in all, this game has really been worth my money.

Still the same problem with a lack of players on any map outside of the first chapter which makes it incredibly fustrating to play. Solotide, (or Vermintide) would have been better if there was some motivation to progress for players, but I still see nothing but Horn and Sewers being played, even by level 40+.\n\n---Old Review Below----\n\nThe game starts really good, but then no one seems to play anythign except for the tutorial map. Random matches will only get you one of three maps. Its not that the game doesnt have more maps, its just that there are two reasons people dont bother.\n\n1) People are massive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and suck at FPS/Team games. This is a fact. Undeniable fact. A fact you have to deal with. This leaves you waiting for ages to find anyone willing (Or even capable) of doing ANY map beyond the first three. They cower behind low level noob ♥♥♥♥ on easy-to-complete maps to get their dice.\n\n2) The AI is complete pigshit. Solo playing even the most basic maps becomes a chore of reduntant movements, standing around, and BOTS sitting directly under their team mate who is impaled on a Hook Rat's Mancatcher. They will also not have any concept of jumping, so they will also stand on a ledge you need to jump from to complete a path. In addition, they will also teleport to someone that is hanging from a cliff and fall to their untimely (And stupid) death.\n\nThis game assumed there would be millions of players for a game-type that was very small to begin with, and assumes having crappy solo play would be the answer to that, and thus force players to play together. True, you can play with others, but you will only ever do so on the earliest maps, since everyone else has quit by now that would want to play something other. Myself included.\n\nWe will see what the future holds. I like Warhammer, but not these "End Times". No one really did as it was more sympathetic to romania and vampire-loving goths. It was made not out of love for the series of table top games, but out of need to compete with other games like Bloodlines or Vampire the Maqurade, and everyone knows it. They would have been better off durring their second edition, and having a bit of diversity from map to map. HAving one enemy type in this day and age seems a bit withered. Granted they did an excelent job with the Skaven, give or take a few dozzen types of Skaven, but a great job none the less. I only wish they would have had an excuse to play more consistantly.\n\nIts hard to really give this game a thumbs up or down, since its perfectly in between. It certainly isnt a bad game, but the population is dwindling to nothing. Those that are left are stuck on the hand full of first chapter maps with no reason to leave since they get rewarded just the same as if they did the final map "White Rat".\n\nAnd withthat said, I cant recomend this game since no one will ever get a full experience from it, due to being forced into the early maps only by sh!t players and cowards unwilling to adventure.\n\nPS: Some maps just randomly wont let you finish. You can be in the "Get Away" cart and it will just idle there. Basically, you cant finish the map because of a well known, and never taken care of bug.","November 9, 2015","false","94.1"," 36 of 61 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","36","61","3","2"

I am, however, a Warhammer enthusiast, and I am pleased to tell you that this game stays fairly true to the brutal, unforgiving nature of the franchise.\n\nYou play one of five heroic figures, each just different enough from the next to provide a noticeably different experience.  The controls are pretty intuitive, combat is quick and fluid, and the weapons are beautiful.  They even have a specific keybinding to "View Weapon," at which point the character will take the weapon and hold it up, as though inspecting it.  Done in first person, this provides a pretty good view of the weapon itself.  As far as I know, there isn't really a point to doing this other than to admire the detail the developers put into the weapon, but I love that they made this an action in the game.  You can also view weapons in your character's inventory screen, in a more nearly traditional way.\n\nThe game rewards you for completing the mission, and basically only for completing the mission.  There are tomes and grimoires you can pick up, which are essentially treasure items, but you only get credit for carrying them with you if you successfully complete the mission.  It doesn't matter if you kill one hundred thousand vermin, or not a single one - you get the same reward for completing the mission either way.  I like this aspect of the game, because it drives home the fact that you aren't really here to soldier it out against the Skaven - you're part of a strike team, an elite infiltration squad, and if you can't complete the objective, nothing else really matters.  It also helps less competitive players feel like they did something other than just hold the door open for the guy with the blunderbuss and the two handed hammer.  For those more competitive players, you still get the glory of seeing your name at the top of the stat list at the end of the mission.\n\nAs far as how the game actually plays... if the trailers don't paint a pretty enough picture for you with the entrails of your enemies, I'm not sure I'm a better artist.  The combat does remind me, in a number of ways, of how Skyrim plays.  It's first person, you have a melee weapon and a ranged weapon, and ammunition is pretty important.  Timing is important.  Blocking is important.  Aiming is less important, because as the name implies, there is a veritable tide of vermin surging forward more often than not, and there are times that it takes significant talent to miss a shot.  Inventory-wise, you have a health item slot, a buff potion slot, and a grenade slot - that's it.  While to me it at first seemed a little too spartan, it turns out that this setup is generally sufficient for what you need to accomplish.\n\nWhile there is no skill-point system, you do get bonus loot for leveling up.  You also get loot for completing missions, and sometimes a consolation prize even if you fail.  If you looted chests and/or found tomes or grimoires, you also get a better chance to receive better loot at the end of the mission.  They harken back to Warhammer's d6 origins when you literally roll on a loot table for your reward, and it is very nostalgic.  I wish I had a little dice-rolling tin like they do....\n\nIt also cannot be stressed enough the importance of at least pairing up, if not traveling as a group of four.  Sometimes special Skaven units will tackle you and render your hero helpless, and one of your friends has to pull them off of you.  This is probably my least favorite part of the game, as it seems a just a little ridiculous that your hero cannot extricate himself from some of these circumstances, and it sometimes seems to artificially bolster the need for teamwork.  That said, it's also just as well if someone wants to be a jerk and run ahead/lag behind/yolo solo.\n\nThe characters are also very chatty.  It adds a great deal of personality to each of them, and some of the lines are just great.  The voice acting is very good, and the litany available to the characters is impressive.  Never a dull moment with arguing elves and dwarves about!\n\nI don't really have a lot of negative to say about this game.  I practically had to max out the mouse sensitivity to give it the handling I was looking for, but that was easily resolved in the in-game options menu.  The lack of a "sprint" button is a little disappointing, but generally you don't have to worry about it very much.  The level design can also be very confusing for me sometimes, and once I was stuck in a single zone of the map for maybe 5-10 minutes, looking for the way out after having run past it a dozen times - but that could be just me.  On the other side of that argument, it seems even more like an actual part of a city, which may or may not have been exceptionally well planned out.  The level of realism in the game is pretty good.\n\nI would certainly recommend this game to probably anyone who likes FPS-type games, or the Warhammer universe.","December 26, 2015","true","26.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/weaf/recommended/235540/","weaf","WEAF","http://steamcommunity.com/id/weaf/","84 products in account","Product received for free\n\nThis review was based on experience during the free weekend May 28 and 29, 2016\nThis game is uncannily similar to Left 4 Dead. I know that is an overdone comparison, but it's true. Everything from the voice callouts, the special enemies,  the player highlighting, to even the feel of the gunplay and melee reminded me strongly of L4D. Where the game differs is in its stronger focus on melee and the progression system.\n\nI primarily enjoyed my time ingame (more on the metagame later). The combat is visceral and the weapons all seem to achieve an appropriate response i.e. the warhammer had plenty of stagger while rapier and pistol had none. The maps were impressive in scope, well varied, and some had interesting gimmicks, particularly the wizard's tower.\n\nAmmunition for the ranged weapons is a greatly limited resource (on some maps) resulting in reliance on the melee. The melee system is basic, but effective. Weapons have a block, bash, light attack, and heavy attack. Which you'll use depends predominantly on what weapon you're using.\n\nThis brings me to the main flaw, the weapon unlock system. Not only is this game a grind-athon, but the item unlocks are mostly random. The system works with a roll of dice at the end of the round, some of which are added or replaced based on ingame item collection. Usually the item received is of the lowest or second lowest rarity, but there is a way to craft items of a higher rarity from 5 of a lower. The biggest problem with this system is not the frustrating nature of the RNG, but the fact that you are most likely not going to receive an item for the class you're playing, unless you have an item that gives you a good chance at it (I'm not certain how to get it, but apparently it's common).\n\nOther than the loot system there a few minor complaints I have with the game that don't detract too much from the core enjoyment thereof. The AI can occasionally be bad; enemies and allies occasionally get stuck, sometimes simply refusing to move when they have a path. Difficulty for the missions is all over the place, and the AI director occasionally makes questionable choices (Two Ratling Gunners and a Rat Ogre at once is not okay). Slightly more importantly, the Developer has left their previous projects, War of the Roses and War of the Vikings, which creates questions of how long the game will be supported.\n\nOverall, while I did enjoy my time playing this game (I beat it on normal and played a bit of hard) I did not feel like I'd want to play it much more, unless it was with friends (but what game isn't fun with friends?). I'm not comfortable recommending it due to an overall lack of value and frustrating mechanics.\n\nThank you for reading. If you downvote my review, I'd like to hear your constructive feedback in the comments because I feel like I gave it a fair overview.","May 29","false","9.5"," 55 of 98 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","55","98","0","16"

The game could run better and I have come across a handful of issues, even with these issues though the game is still alot of fun to play.\n\nIf you liked Left4Dead or Payday2 give this a try, it is pretty much those two games combined but with much better melee and a good item/reward system. With some improvements to optimization, more missions and bug fixes, this could be pretty special game. It can also go from easy to very hard on some levels, so be ready! Most of the maps are well made, although some are a good deal than others and a few of them where way to short.\n\nIs it perfect? Nope. Is it good Coop fun? Yes. Grab a few friends and get ready for some gameplay that is a good amount of fun, especially with others. It will be interesting to see what the devs do in the future with this game.\n\nI do wish there was some kind of versus mode like in Left4Dead but maybe in the future?

A beautiful and enjoyable execution of a proven co-op formula. Between the slaughtering of massive hordes of mutant rat-men and the dice-roll system for the loot...it ends up being quite fun and addictive.\n\nTaking advantage of a winning formula for co-op gameplay, Vermintide emulates the Left4Dead experience in many respects. Too name a few, the hordes of rat-men that randomly surprise you; the special enemies with unique abilities that often spawn at the worst times and incapacitate a teammate; the medkits that can be used to heal said teammate. There are many similarities, but there are enough differences to make the game feel fresh and distinguish itself.\n\nIn particular, the melee combat is quite an improvement over Left4Dead. It just feels good. The blood and gore of hewn rat-men will satisfy any bloodlust. The AI is done very well and the seemingly endless spawn points will continue to surprise you--even with your back to a wall you're rarely safe, as the enemies climb out of sewers, holes in walls, and drop from rooftops.\n\nThe atmosphere and visual experience is top-notch. Starting with the camera panning across the map, you get a feel for the level of detail and the dark, war torn world you are entering. One of my favorite parts of the experience in this game is seeing the menacing Skaven (rat-men) scattered around the maps: haunched over--seemingly feeding off a dead body; perched on rooftops overlooking the streets--sillouttes against the sky; leaning against a wall in an alley off the street--ready to pounce on you when you are unaware. I was pleasantly surprised that those rats in the distant backdrop, climbing over rooftops would quickly make their way onto the playable area of the map and hurl themselves at you if you didn't pick them off beforehand. The feeling of a "Vermintide" is definitely there.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun and addictive co-op game that is fairly easy to learn and still a challenge to win; a game where you can casually hop into a mission to fight the hordes with your friends; and a game where you can chop mutant rat-men into a bloody mess, then this is a game for you.\n\nThank you for the fun time Fat Shark and keep up the good work. I foresee the coming of DLC and I hope Fat Shark delivers something of substance unlike some other developers out there who have chosen to drown their games in half-baked, overpriced fluff.","November 1, 2015","true","37.6"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","19","31","0","4"

I really do, which is why I spend 60 hours hoping it was good. There are just so many small things that add up to a collected experience of "Man this game needed 1 more month in the oven". Now, some fanatic warhammer fans will downvote all these negative reviews, but believe me when I say that there is no bigger fanboy than I. This is also the reason why I'm am (and should be) the most critical reviewer I can be with games in this franchise.\n\nI'll cut it "short" by writing the classic pros and cons\n\nPros-\n+Melee combat is great. Weapons feel different from each other and you need to learn how to use your particular choice of weapon if you want to do well on the harder difficulties. Besides that the block and push functions work well, and you get rewarded for learning how to do this effectively. You will likewise get punished if you think that hitting is the only thing needed for success.\n\n+Maps and graphics are amazing. I put these under the same category because I'm mostly talking about texture and feel,  and not about map-layout which is fine but negligable. The game oozes of warhammer and a dark setting where you really feel like moving through a medieval-esque city. I love it and the immersion is super strong.\n\n+Left for dead with loot! This is a great way to add longevity to a game, and I like getting that shiny new item to try out on the next run. This has its drawbacks too which I'm going to talk about in the cons.\n\nCons-\n-Let's start with the loot. Loot is great and all, but why do so many people have hundreds and hundreds of hours played in L4D if there is none. It simply comes down to a question of wether the game is fun or not. And boy is L4D fun. Same could be said for counter-strike. These games get played because they are fun and no other reason. So why does vermintide have loot and what does it contribute? As I said it feels great to earn a new piece of loot.\nThe problem with this is that loot has become the central point of the game to a point where exploit after exploit is being found and used to get that slight edge over the game. Alot of people would much rather play the same map over and over again rather than do a slightly harder map with a chance to fail and not get those shinies! This tells us a few things about the game. 1. alot of people play to get loot instead of getting loot for playing. And 2. the games maps are badly balanced loot-wise. The harder maps won't give you better loot, they just cost you more time with a higher chance to fail (and get zero loot). You are basicly not awarded proportionally with your effort. I could write page after page on how this could be fixed, and alot of people on the official forums are already doing just that.\nI will however add another little note to the loot system -  The better the loot is, the more stats it has. Most stats are percentagebased (like 3-10% chance of healing you on a hit) and undetermined until you spend resouces to upgrade them at which point the stat percentage is determined. So sometimes you get a great item and roll the worst possible stats. I have a sword with 1% chance to heal you on a hit which is just the worst possible thing in the univers to see on an exotic item. What I'm trying to say with this rant is that in order to get the items you really want, you need to play several hundred hours. I have about 60 hours played right now, and I have only rolled terrible stats on my 25+ exotic items (exotic is the highest tier of non-cosmetic item in the game). That is an incredible amount of sub-par weapons.\nThe loot system needs to be reworked if the game wants to survive a few months into the future.\n\n-Optimization is just god aweful. Seriously, this game is terribly optimized to a point where some newer computers need to run it on lowest settings to get 40+ FPS. The developers are constantly telling us that the sheer amount of skaven is taking alot of CPU power, which is why we are experiencing lag. Problem is that L4D has the same if not more enemies with similar if not better AI, and everyone and their dog can run L4D. Besides that the graphics are much better than L4D, but not on potato settings and resolution, where you can still experience terrible frame-drops. This might actually be my main complaint. It feels like a beautiful painting with stickfigures instead of people. Sad but true.\n\n- So many bugs. Seriously, this game has not been tested enough. The developers are working hard and somewhat responsive on the forums, but damn did they do a bad job of playtesting this before release. It is a mess sometimes with skave clipping through the floor and specials teleporting or shooting through the roof and whatnot. Just plain bad.\n\n-No dedicated servers (Yet). It is peer to peer which means that the whole game comes down to the connection to the host pc. And even worse, there are no save points in the game, so if the host has a DC of any kind, you will have to start ALL OVER. This is just plain bad design. When testing the game, the developers were all planted in the same building and probably playing over LAN at which point they thought - "Well this is a perfectly good way to handle multiplayer". Problem is.... It isn't. I haven't met a single person ingame who hasn't experience at least a couple of these, and most of us has had it happen in the last minutes of a map. You just want to punch something when a 30-40 minute playsession gets terminated.\n\n+-There are alot more to say about this game, but I won't do it. I have said what is most crucial to know for whoever wants to buy this game. I have played 60 hours and will likely play 60 more. But I won't do it because I think the game deserves it. I do it because I'm a loot-♥♥♥♥♥, and I am repulsed by the notion that this possibly amazing game has made me one. You can do better, and for that I advice you to not buy this game yet. Buy it when the developers fix these things.\n\nI promise to revise this review when/if things get better.","October 31, 2015","false","64.5"," 25 of 43 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","25","43","0","0"

Why on Earth do i still care about this Abomination?\n2. HOW just HOW can it be at 84 % Ratings????\n\nReason:\n\nTerribly optimized - don't look at the requirements they are far from what you REALLY need to play this game. At first it gave me a BSOD EVERY Hour due to Brutal CPU Usage (100 % in some areas - idling in the inn was at 50 % aleady) and the temperature has gone to 80. at least they fixed that, but i'm still afraid of bluescreens at every Corner, even with FPS capped at 30 and lowest settings. And yes i checked EVERYTHING out what i could do and my PC is close to the Recommended Specs. Many Others have the same issue, they just do not appear anymore in the Forums. So if you can play the newest games on at least 4k Texture packs you can give this playable stresstest a try, Otherwise stay FAR FAAAAAAAR AWAY!\nNo rewards - imagine playing on the highest difficulty and all you get is junk you could have gotten on EASY\nGoes to an Elite's only game - huge grindfest, Destiny has come to PC!

If someone even says s/he has the ultimate equipement and NOT at around 1000+ H gameplay you can bet it's a cheat. they may have fixed it somehow (probably luck) but some cheats still work, but even the hackers who created those cheats have abondoned this game.\nPlayer base is continously dropping - if you don't have Enhanced Steam check  this link [steamcharts.com]\nAfter 5 Months hoping i could play this thing again, i gotta admit i doubt this will ever happen, huge shame as it could be a good game.\n\nMy rating on this:\n4 / 10 with it's poor optimization\n7 /10 without it\n\nThere are better and way cheaper coop games out there than this.","March 7","false","66.3"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","16","26","4","0"

So you can blast and blow up enemies with powerful fire spells, or slash them down with your back up sword.\nYou do need to be careful though, as using magic too long can result in you exploding from the build up of power. As such you need you to frequently exhaust the excess heat. Although this can result in you taking quite a bit of damage as well.\n\nI suppose it serves to balance out the Bright Wizard's awesome damage capabilities, and forcing the player to control and manage it more. It's still very fun, and adds quite a bit.\n\nI don't have much experience with the other classes much; although the Pistol and rapier wielding Witch Hunter is also a lot of fun as a medium and close range fighter.\n\nStory and Lobby wise everything starts and ends in the Tavern, and there's even a mission to protect that. In there you have access to different missions, levels of difficulty, the Forge, and Inventory.\n\nEach character has unique items they can use, although through the forge these can be combined to get random new ones, or scrapped for upgrade materials. So if you're lucky on the end of a mission through the dice roll ( which is based on mission performance ) or crafted you can upgrade items to unlock their extra bonuses; if they have any.\n\nThe inventory system is rather self explanatory, you can change items based on their attributes and looks which results in some minor character customisation.\n\nIn regards to missions, they're fairly linear, with some off shoots which leads to extra mini areas and little treasures, and supplies.\n\nGraphics and performance wise the game does very well. Although there are still some off frame drops here and there, even without a swarm of enemies. Even so it's not much of an issue, although if you have a Midranged or lower graphics card I wouldn't recommend pushing the settings to extreme. I'm sure these will be fixed very soon though.\n\nThe main enemy are of course the Skaven, and it wouldn't be like them if there weren't swarms and swarms of them during certain parts.\nIt's good then that the vast majority of them are rather dumb, badly armed and weak. Although if you do happen to run into a unique one such as a Commander, or Gunner you'll need some well placed Headshots to make short work of them.  Otherwise you're in for a small world of hurt.\n\nSadly unlike L4D, other players cannot play the unique Skaven units at this time. They probably might never, considering that they're still very inferior to main Human characters. Sorry Skaven fans.\n\nAll in All it's a blast, and even more fun with three other friends. I would gladly recommend it as one of the great Warhammer Fantasy games in quite some time.\n\nPC Gameplay Footage\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6WiS16xRck","October 23, 2015","true","14.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Pro's are that the game is fun to play and that team cooperation makes a HUGE difference whether you will succeed in completing the mission or not which is a big plus in my book (selfishness is not rewarded here). Con's are that since the last update enemys can litteraly materialize out of thin air around you or worse, behind you, which kinda feels unfair to me (it was the main reason why I stoped playing L4d2 back in the day) since there is nothing in the world you can do in order to prevent the following damage you take by these spawning foes. Another major issue is the reward system which to put plainly - SUCKS BALLS. If this is the developers attempt to cause through intermittent conditioning an addiction to the game amongst the game's players than it might not be working as planned. This is the main issue for the increasing lack of motivation that I feel to continue playing this game. There is ZERO correlation between how good you played through the round you just finished or the amount of dice, tomes and grimoires you collected during that round to the quality of the loot you will receive. You can have the most amazing round and still recieve crap items. In fact, it seems that that is the default mode. After finishing more than 100 different rounds of the game I can testify to only about 3 good drops. Thats it. And my main character still doesn't have anything close to the weapons it should have at this point. Last point, the game crashes. Not as bad as a few weeks ago but it still happens about every tenth game. Also, if the games host leaves the game the game will restart which is just lame and frustrating. I hope the developers fix these issues in the near future.

Now the game is all but abandoned and it was pimped out to be the next best thing since sliced bread.\n\nNow, here comes a long another Left4Dead style, horde based, class based, multiplayer coop heavy title by an indie dev known mostly for RPG's, and by god does it put Evolve to shame. On top of not only looking better visually, having a good amount of content, better gameplay with more satisfying classes, more weapon variety, more enemy variety, better pacing, and even better written dialog between characters, it is all being sold for $30. In an age when a title like this could be sold for twice that with about $50 worth in season pass garbage and skins if sold by a big budget publisher, one has to wonder what world these developers over at FatShark even came from.\n\nThe answer? The world of Warhammer son! The attention to detail is bar none to only the Relic Dawn of War and Space Marine titles. The setting is great, with highly detailed locales filled with secret passageways, chests, alternate routes, houses, rooftops, sewers, forests, harbors, magic lairs, YOU NAME IT! The controls are fluid and extremely satisfying. The combat is visceral and diverse while not feeling too complex or overly simplified. It looks great, and it sounds great with excellent voice acting from the entire cast with lines of dialog making this old (Mid 20's) Warhammer fanboy wheep with joyful tears of manliness.\n\nSadly the game is not perfect (Knew this was coming) as it suffers from numerous bugs and performance issues, but nothing game breaking. While the loot in the game is interesting and extremely satisfying to get, it is sadly hampered by RNG dice rolls that will happily screw you over as much as reward you. The grind is real, my commrads, and the community is sadly as RNG as the loot drops since you have a high chance of running into A-HOLES that kick you randomly, curse you through the chat (Mute your damn mics, I mean it), or never stop boasting about how they played the game in beta and/or how high their level is. Play with friends ladies and gentlemen, the game is cheap enough to afford at least two people. The bots are horrible to deal with, never leaving your side, and never picking up Tomes (Essential to have better luck with RNG) nor healing themselves or even YOU appropriatly.\n\nDespite all that the game is a freaking blast to play through. Grab some friends, grab some mead and have a bloody good time for hours and hours of grind, fun, and rat murdering. Think the Orchid man if he was written by Tolkien.\n\n8/10. Can easily be higher once the devs churn out those free content updates and DLC (which I will happily support)!","October 31, 2015","true","23.0"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

This is a step in the right direction but falls far short of expectations. None of the major problems have been addressed.\n\nShould you buy it?\n\n- No, not yet\n\nWhy?\n\nThe game is not ready for release.\n\n- Terrible netcode, horrible p2p latency issues, numerous drop out, no host migration, unpredicatable AI, unpredicatable hitboxes, unpredicatable and unrewarding loot.\n\nLet me first apologise for the long review. i want to give a fair critque of the current state of the game and to explain why i would not recommend this game. This game has great features, but the major problem is not with the feature but the poor way they are implemented. Think of someone having great ideas but says "Meh, ♥♥♥♥ it, this will i do" when implementing them. This is the game i am reviewing. This review will warn you about the frustration this game will cause, possibily because of those features but mainly due to the terrible state of the game.\n\nIntro:\n\nDo you like melee? Do you like ranged combat? how about leveling and getting loot? All these sound like great things in a game right? Well, they are, Vermintide is basically a very good game. The ranged combat is good but not as good as other dedicated ranged combat games. The melee is tactile but not a good as a dedicated melee game. And, the combination of the two mechanics are inferior to games such as Killing Floor 2, but better than other game that are not heavily focused on pure combat mechanics like Skyrim.\n\nWhat about interesting character classes? A teamwork-centric experience? Well the game is also these things. The classes are differentiated but are not as clearly as other co-op roleplaying games like Dungeon Defenders but is more varied than Left4Dead and other horde mode games.\n\nSo would i recommend this game?\n\n- If the game worked properly: Yes. It does most things quite well, like a jack of all trades, but it is a master of none. Fun when it works, a well balanced game with a number of interesting features that have great potential, but mostly it doesnt. Allow me to explain.\n\nPoor Net-Code:\n\n- Imagine a challenging experience where you have the chance of great reward. You work hard, co-ordinate with friends or strangers to complete very difficult tasks, but near the end of the challenge... BAM!!!! ♥♥♥♥ YOU, YOU GET NOTHING! Why? Because the host disconnected? Because the host is a troll and disbanded the party on purpose? You Disconnected? You could experience any number of these issues.\n\nPoor-Graphics Optimisation:\n\n- For anyone without a high-end PC you will be playing on medium at best. Even then, you will experience severe drops in framerate. From 60+ to low 10's during combat. In addition to this, the poo optimisation has lead to GPU's over-heating, and hence, crashing the game.\n\nP2P Stability:\n\n- Most, if not all players, have experienced disconnections and latency issues. How often do these things happen will vary depending on your connection. If your internet is perfect this will still affect you. If your internet is average, then often. If your internet is very good in almost every circumstance and does no experience any of these issues in any other game, still often.\n\nUn-Polished Mechanics:\n\n- How about you avoid these issues most of the time? Do you like killing vermin? How about killing a rat but moments later your screen flashes and notifies you that you have taken damage. Why? Because of the horribly unpredictable latency. Swing your Axe/Sword/Mace: every now and again, nothing happens. Shoot your Gun/Bow/Staff: same problem.\n\nPoor Game Design:\n\n- Challenging games like Dark Souls are challenging but fair. Good mechanics, learning the game,  patience, and practice, will result in the game becoming more enjoyable. But in Vermintide, these things are irrelevant from time to time. If the game decides you take copious amounts of damages you will. Can you block the damage? No, Can you dodge the damage? No. Can the player control any of the variables in the game that will prevent this damage? No. The game has unblockable, undodgeable, randomly generated enemies that can spawn during opening-cut scenes, behind walls, under the map, or any number of unacceptable cricumstance that will wipe your entire party.\n\nRNG (random number generation) Hell:\n\n- The loot system is far too unpredicatable and unrewarding. When you (If you) complete a map, you have to roll a set of 7 dice; this will determine which of the 7 objects you receive. The 7 possible objects are all randomly generated. Once you receive the item, there is randomly selected trait out of a possible 30 traits, most of which are not that useful, but a select few that are ridciously overpowered and game changing. Then you 'unlock' the traits which randomly determines the % change of it proc'ing. So far, that is 4 RNG hoops to jump through when receiving an item. This is more random and annoying than Diablo 3's loot system at launch which was heavily critised. You cannot control the loot in any meaningful way. The game does not take your preferred or weapon choice into account when determine the 7 possible reward items. Completing objectives only increases the possibility of an increase in of item quality (white, green, blue, orange, red) but you can still end up with trash/white loot in the second hardest difficulty.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI want to spend 50, 100, 500, hours on this game. i really do. Can i? yes, of course i can, but it will probably lose my ♥♥♥♥. The game has potential, but it's the same potential as a wild animal. It may be cute and welcoming at first but be prepared as they will likely ♥♥♥♥ your ♥♥♥♥ up after a while.\n\nThis game is no different from the numerous other game that have been released in incomplete states. At launch the game is barely playable. Numerous game breaking problems, balance issues, and a host of other minor bugs makes this game currently a horrible experience.\n\nSome have been able to overlook these issues. I applaud them, and it is good that there are people who are enjoying their experience of this game. However, if your time is valuable, and your consumer mindset is to pay for a good product, this game is not what you're currently looking for.\n\nP.S. WTF!! this game is designed to be played at an FOV of 65?!?! Is it fair to make a connection between the FOV of this game and DOOM or Quake1 or any other game that was released prior to Windows 2000? Like seriously... WTF! The developers have stated this game is intend and designed to be played at 65FOV. A slider is provided but will affect the game in serious ways. Any increase beyond 65 will result in unpredicatbility of hit detection and crashes. If you dont have an issue with 65FOV, your experience of this game will be much improved compared to mine, but if you wish for anyting above 65, even a slight increase to 70, a nice even number, no. GTFO, not intended.\n\nEdit: For those who recommend: Host your own game to avoid drop out and crashes? Yes it is "a" solution, but should not be "the" solution. Mathematically, a 4 co-op player game with only players hosting and not joining does not a 4 player co-op game make. This is something the developers must address. Hosting a game is a temporaly work-around for an unresolved bug.\n\nFYI - I prodminately play with a fixed group over skype. This makes certain aspects of the game far more fun. Naturally we will enjoy things more with people we enjoy, but having a great group of friends to play with does not result in me or my friends overlooking the obvious flaws in this game.","October 24, 2015","false","66.3"," 116 of 219 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","116","219","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VikingManofTribes/recommended/235540/","VikingManofTribes","VikingMan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VikingManofTribes/","62 products in account","Vermintide is a fun game for the first few hours, until the glaringly obvious game-breaking bugs become apparent. If you are interested in playing a game with strategic depth to co-op play that rewards good reflexes and accuracy, then this game is NOT what you're looking for. This game is broken in its current state. Fatshark, the developer, has made it abundantly clear that they are more concerned with early DLC, cross-platform distribution (of an unfinished game), and randomized gear grinding than creating a balanced and functional game. The bugs are numerous and many of them have persisted since the first release of the game despite several patches. Here is my list of the most game-breaking issues:\n\n1) Spawn Logic:\n\nThere is little sense in how/when/where enemies spawn. Often you will catch waves of basic or special skaven spawning right in front of you. Watching enemies materialize in front of you not only destroys the immersion, but also increases the difficulty of the game in a non-meaningful way. Enemies will spawn directly in front of your path, trapping you in areas where enemies just beyond your line-of-sight can then attack you through walls, which bring us to the next issue...\n\n2) Hitboxes:\n\nThere are several issues with hitboxes:\n\n2a) Object irrelevance. Skaven can attack you through nearly any object. It doesn't matter if you're standing behind a bookshelf or a wall, under a platform or set of stairs, or on top of a platform or pillar, because the skaven will hit you through them. They can hit you through almost anything as long as you're within melee range, and that melee range extends beyond the visible range of the attack animation. Sometimes they'll even hit you while you're blocking (even with full stamina). Additionally, horde events set skaven hitboxes in place even when the spawning skaven have not yet rendered. This means that it can be impossible to rush through narrow areas ahead of horde events because you will be blocked by collision detection with skaven that don't yet exist.\n\n2b) Hit registry. Many shots do not register hits, even when using hitscan weapons like the rifles. This can happen at any time. In my experience this happens more often when there are more skaven on the screen. A related issue is that high-penetration weapons (like the Soldier's rifle) will not register any hits whatsoever if the number of potential targets is too high (for example when a wave of skaven is stacked on top of each other). Additionally, your pushes can fail to register, seemingly at random.\n\n2c) Hitbox size. Allied hitboxes are much larger than they appear. They seem to extend about 0.5m beyond the character models in all directions. This is very frustrating when trying to use ranged weapons to assist your allies. Shooting over an ally's head requires a steep angle. Additionally, allied hitboxes can clip through each other, so you'll end up shooting your friend who is standing 0.5m behind you because their hitbox is clipping through you without any visual cue to let either of you know.\n\n2d) Terrain clipping. Put simply, you will trip and snag yourself on far too many objects. Is that a lone decorative brick on the floor? STUCK. How about a gradual slope upward? BETTER JUMP CONSTANTLY, otherwise you'll get stuck on literally nothing.\n\n3) Optimization:\n\nThe game runs like molasses and crashes often. Even with decent hardware (I have a GTX 650 Ti, for example) and the lowest graphical/physics settings the game can rarely maintain >50fps, even with zero enemies spawned. The game bogs down to <20fps frequently when fighting larger waves, tanks, or during finale events, further crippling anyone's ability to rise to the challenge. This happens to every single person I know who has played the game (about 10 people), even those with hardware vastly superior to mine.\n\n*****\n\nOn top of these absolutely critical gameplay issues, there are many smaller bugs that become more and more annoying with time. Sound bugs (music, environmental effects, and horde event effects will sometimes stop playing for the entire level), graphical bugs (invisible and unblockable skaven), and lobby bugs (sometimes if someone leaves your party during a level then you will be unable to complete that level because the game somehow recognizes the former player as still being a player rather than a bot, and since the bot will not enter the wagon at the end of the map it won't allow you to trigger the map finish) are but a few. There are STILL more bugs to write about, but instead I'll finish with one last gripe:\n\nGear is an integral part of this game. The customization is welcome but it is also terribly balanced. Many traits are vastly inferior to the few good traits, and good gear is essential to being able to complete the hardest gamemodes. Since the gear drops and trait rolls are random, you had better be ready to grind your face off trying to get decent enough gear to continue playing the game. I know people who have played HUNDREDS of hours and don't have any orange trinkets.\n\n4/10 game. Good music, good voice-acting, good art, and good lore. Everything else is terribly lacking.","March 28","false","173.2"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","16","27","2","2"

You will encounter all sorts of crazy and abstract enemies such as: "Fatal Error!", "Corrupt Game Data", "Login Failed", and the final boss of the co-op mode: "Version Mismatch Error!". These fearsome beasts are defeated by repeatedly verifying the integrity of the game cache and reinstalling the game. But this isn't the end of them! You must grind these enemies every Tuesday, which also has the added benefit of giving you XP towards your "boredom" skill in a different game called "Life" (graphics are awesome but the gameplay sucks).\n\nOh and there's also a minigame called Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide where you can take on hordes of evil enemies and their overlords and combat specialists in co-op missions, all in order to gain loot between missions to further your power as one of five unique classes and define the way you want to play the game, as if the game is some sort of mashup of Skyrim, Left 4 Dead and Borderlands.

In spite of this it is a great game non the less. The item drops take a very long time to get anything decent and it took me about 30 hrs to actually get anything good while playing on nightmare with horn of magnus. Which i recommend as its fast and easy to finish for items. A down side is getting trinkets or even good trinkets is practically impossible. With 150 hrs on record i have no good trinkets to speak of not even a legendary one so that is somthing they need to work on big time, All the while im always playing nightmare so item drops are better but you rarly see trinkets on there.\nIf you dont buy the collectors editions then you cant buy it after the fact since there is no in game store which is a downside but since there isnt a store and the collectors edition doesnt do anything for you (i think it gives you some hats which are just for decoration on your character no perks) its not worth the double price. Save your money.\nOverall this game is very fun especially with a good team with microphones so i recommend this game but it does need a lot of work and i belive with all the patches they are doing they are working on making it better so give it a try, just dont buy the collectors edition as its not worth the extra cash.

In this game, you have the honor of serving the Emperor and Empire; with sword, gunpowder, bolts, magic and finesse. This game is action-paced, and as many have mentioned this before: It plays very similar to Left 4 Dead, except the Zombie cliche was knocked out and you actually have more variety and things to do.\n\nThe cast: An edgelord witchhunter who sneers like a jolly ol Englishman, an alcoholic elf-bashing dwarf stereotype with an axe, an mysterious and agile dwarf-bashing elf, an old lady that lights people on fire; and finally, a poster child empire soldier who lives up to the Landschneckt namebrand.\n\nThe Antagonists: A wide variety of filthy and disgusting Skaven rat-like humanoid creatures, varying in size and capability. You have Skaven specialists which resemble the behavior of certain L4D specialty zombies; with some differences to separate them. For example, a Hunter equivalent from L4D in Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide would be the Gutter Runner; which is slightly easier to hit but can also disappear and you may not notice before it comes back to strike. Specialty Skaven like the Gunner has no distinguishible L4D counterparts; thus is unique in its own way. You have the Rat Ogre which replaces the Tank; but also you can parry its melee and dodge its attacks better. There is sometimes an armored Skaven which requires an armor-penetrating attack or weapon, as will be discussed further.\n\nThe Gameplay: The gameplay follows a similar route to Left 4 Dead; except it has more of an emphasis on Melee weapons. You have access to a multitude of potions which buff your character in some way, and is distinguishable from Left 4 Dead since some buffs give you more strength for example. You start at the beginning of a level and have to slowly make your way to the endpoint, and in between that is a struggle with skaven hordes, specialists, side-objectives and so on. The levels in Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide are usually long, and like Left 4 Dead: You can hit specialty monsters randomly with different spawn counts. Unlike Left 4 Dead, Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide offers some extra goodies to contend with, such as having a "lobby" level where you are in a tavern with a chest to check your equipment (you have persistent weapon drops and gear), an altar to make trinkets as well as a forge to combine items (Of same rarity) and upgrade some.\n\nThis game rewards you with experience points and level ups, which allow you to have better access to more Trinket slots, weapon drops as well as new levels (assuming you beat the beginning ones). In each mission, there is a chance to loot a dice which you can then roll at the end of the game which may give you the chance to strike a better weapon drop. Unlike CS:GO, these weapons are NOT skins and are instead fully functional with different stats and function; thus you aren't riddled with such annoyances of pointless textures slapped on weapons you use. In the lobby area, you can form a group and use the interactive map to decide which mission and difficulty you want to do, and you can change your hero from one of the 5 heroes.\n\nWhile the game behaves similar to Left 4 Dead, it offers enough unique experiences and extra features that I don't consider it a retextured Left 4 Dead mod. The level design in this game is great, there is more of an emphasis on vertical heights and bridge crossings; making the navigation experience a fresh change. The specialty Skaven as I mention: have similarities to the Left 4 Dead specialty Zombies, except some small details in their behavior and functionality. The game puts a emphasis on teamwork. If none of this matters and you are a Warhammer Fantasy fan, then by all means; you will not be let down by this culturally rich Warhammer Fantasy game. But let me hope that you do at least care about the background features and overall framework of the game first. One other thing: Every character has a variety of weapons to choose from, some are faster than others but don't penetrate armor, and vice versa. This allows for planning out your character's loadout to balance situations you run into, such as armored Skaven or hordes which need crowd control.\n\nOverall, I am happy with the game and recommend it to anyone who likes these kind of games, it is a refreshing change from the Zombie cliche and definitely pushes in some fresh features that are not seen in L4D titles. I know I have compared this game to Left 4 Dead a lot; but there are a lot of similarities, so I felt it would be necessary to compare.\n\nPros:\n+Coop-Oriented FPS game.\n+Intuitive and fun level design.\n+Breaks away from the zombie cliche.\n+Inventory system and persistent unlocks.\n+Good melee system, good dodging features.\n+Characters have distinct capabilities for their roles.\n+Takes place in the Warhammer Fantasy universe.\n+Beautiful visuals and physics.\n\nMixed:\n=Only Skaven to fight, but the game is sort of centered around that.\n=Antialiasing in this game isn't that good, but you can work around with external video settings override.\n\nCons:\n-Some bugs are found, such as a Skaven getting stuck in a wall.\n-The game crashed on me once.\n-Some of the levels are too dark and thus difficult to see.","May 28","true","7.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stupidusername/recommended/235540/","stupidusername","Stupid_Username","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stupidusername/","303 products in account","Warhammer: The End Times - Vermintide is a 1-4 player cooperative game in the style of Left 4 Dead. The action is unequivocally fast-paced and sticking together is vital for avoiding the team dying a quick death. It was clearly built with a primary motive of supplying replay value, but it of course depends largely on your investment in the atmosphere, mechanics, and loot system.\nI'll note here that I know very little of Warhammer fantasy but still enjoyed the game and the setting, and also that I bought the game pre-release.\n\nVariety of missions from short objective-focused missions (search, protect, etc.) to long adventure missions with a changing dynamic.\nAttention to detail on the maps, combined with the fast paced nature of the game, means you'll be able to notice new intricacies with new playthroughs.\nElement of randomness means items and enemies can appear in different places, keeping suspense high.\nUnique characters capable of handling different weapons means you will be able to and encouraged to experience and learn different styles of play.\nFive (current number) unique characters as opposed to four means you will always have a choice as to whom you wish to play as.\nDropping into games after they've started, replacing a bot, is possible. It is therefore easy to get into a game and not too problematic if someone exits yours.\nMission rewards and experience are handed out when a mission ends, meaning people are a little more inspired to stick around for the full duration (even if the mission is a failure, there is a small bonus).\nForge/ upgrade and prayer systems give you something to do with rewards you don\'t care so much for, letting you turn them into something better.\nHidden items which better your chances of getting higher-tier rewards are fun to discover and also add an interesting risk-reward dynamic, as you can wound your chances of success to improve your chances of desirable loot.\nUp to five (current number) levels of difficulty also adds to the risk-reward (higher difficulty: more experience points), and lets you choose between casual or more intense play.\nThe soundtrack is good and it appears to fit the setting and the skaven hordes well.\nSome DLC was released for the game but the developers seem to have taken measures to avoid it splitting up the playerbase too much. You do not necessarily need to purchase the DLC in order to play the DLC.\nSigmar's Blessing and Last Stand were just free updates to the game. The first was to improve the loot system and the second adds a survival mode with one free survival map (based on a section of a regular map).\nThe Schlusselschloss DLC was a second survival mode map (this time unique). You can play it without paying for it by selecting 'Last Stand' and then selecting to play a 'Random' level or by having a friend with the DLC invite you to the game.\nThe Drachenfels DLC adds three more regular maps, and again a friend can invite you to the game even if you don't own the DLC yourself (you're still fighting Skaven and it's largely more of the same, to some people's dismay).\n\nHowever,\nIt won't take too long to play through all of the missions just once, at least on the easier difficulties. Although the game lends itself to replayability, if you don't want to replay anything, you should buy it with a high % off. The same goes for current paid DLC.\nAlthough missions and characters are justified with a short bit of background, you shouldn't expect to be sucked into a story as much as you should expect to be sucked into glorious rat genocide.\nThere is only so much you can do locally. You can't play splitscreen/ local coop, and human teammates have more potential to help you survive and prosper than the bots do. Higher difficulties may just mean frustrating deaths if you're play alone.\nOf course, human teammates can mess up too, and this is a game where it's expected that you'll die a few times anyway (or not get the loot you want). If you can\'t relax or enjoy tragic humour then you may have occasional 'issues'...\nI find the first-person perspective in this game feels a little weird. Things change in scale noticeably, and your hands can float slightly inside the walls. You, and enemies, also seem to hit further than I would first expect. Related to that, I know some other want the ability to play in third-person, but so far you can only view your character like that.\nSo finally... it's a fun game for people who like frantic cooperative gameplay. It's fairly easy to get into but also requires you to learn and evolve in order to tackle the higher difficulties. And it's essentially a multiplayer game. Attention to detail and loot progress mean replayability is the focus.","June 1","true","22.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Which you wil not have anyway as I seen them only once so far in loot table. Good luck rolling 7 succeses on 1k6.\nWhole loot mechanics is like in f2p grindfest game. You can actualy "create" new weapons by sacrificing ones you do not want to use. But if you want to remove RNG from what you get (for example you want Two Hander) you need to gather 125 exactly SAME weapons like one you want to have RNG chance geting good orange (2nd best rarity, best rarity cant be crafted) you actualy want. Thats hundred hours of gameplay for ONE weapon.\nMechanics are downrigt biased against players like enemies attacks have longer reach than most melee weapons players have at disposal. Most weapons players use do not stagger or have so slow attack speed that enemy can recover between swings and swing back. Here lies the worst part - if theirs swing animation started they automaticaly hit. No matter that you killed them or staggered them mid swing.\nSpecial enemeis ignore collisions so they can always reach you, always disable you no matter how many lesser enemies are around you (and enemies can also attack trough other enemies with no restricions making theirs absurd melee renge even worse). But you have hard time to even get clear shot at them when they ghost trough army of lesser ones.\nMost enemies are faster than characters, when they get near they slow down your movement speed just by being in proximity.\nHordes are almost constant on many maps, no matter how silent you try to play.\nServers are empty, even today when game can be played free, it took me 1 hour to find party to play with on hard, and of cousre game crashed on 2nd mission near end. What ended with me have time to write this review.\nEnemies are also ridiculously tough, it take multiple swings even with two handed weaponry to take even weakest enemeis down. Yet even weakest enemy can kill you in like 8 hits on hard ?\nThat also makes many weapon classes nearly useless at anything but easy/normal as they hit only 1/2/3 enemies (Single dagger, Sword, TWO HANDED EXECUTIONER AXE, Axe, ranged weapons which cant one/two shot enemies like for example shortbow at anything not long range including shotguns which are pure joke) or have very low stamina so you cant block and push enemies away from you.","May 29","false","8.8"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","18","31","0","0"

If none of those apply to you, you might want to wait with this until it's on sale.\n\nThis game is 4 people who work together to get to the end of a map, usually doing small events during the map that involves holding out an attack by a horde of enemies, or transporting sacks of grain/barrels to key locations, all while being attacked by hordes of enemies. On top of the normal enemies who are mostly just fodder, there are special types of enemies, much like in Left 4 Dead, that require teamwork to kill.\n\nThe maps are very linear, with small areas to explore for various loot that can spawn in set locations. There's a total of 13 maps varying in length and difficulty. The different maps help to keep things fresh, but there's just one problem. You most likely wont be playing most of these maps at all.\n\nThe progression system is what fights against the different maps, because only some maps are long enough to contain special items that you can pick up during the mission, to improve your loot drops at the end of a mission. This bonus to your loot is so significant, that it feels completely useless to play any other map than one where you can get all the bonus loot items.\nAdditionally, some maps are just easier than others, but they all drop the same loot. You can see this on the matchmaking time, people are mainly just playing the same map over and over, because there's no reason to ever go to another map.\n\nIf you love getting loot, then you will most likely end up in the same situation as me. Clearing the same map over and over, so that's definitely something to keep in mind. I personally still like doing that one map, because of the special enemies that spawn randomly, every run is never completely the same, and even though there's effectively only a very small number of maps, the different classes add spice to the game.\n\nThere's 5 classes: A bright wizard, who can shoot fireballs or beams of fire and other fire related destruction, depending on what weapon she uses. Then there's an elven archer with a variety of bows and fast melee weapons. A Witch Hunter, who can dual wield pistols. An Imperial Guardsman, who can choose to be a tank, or use a slow firing but strong gun. Last a dwarf, who can also be a tank, with interesting gun choices too.\nAll the classes have a few different ranged and melee weapons to use, that change up the gameplay. You have limited ammunition, so you will have to use a mix of melee and ranged combat, which is a lot of fun.\n\nThe loot that drops at the end of a game has 4 different types of quality. White, green, blue and orange. Each step up in quality gives the weapon one extra random trait, that you need to unlock by salvaging other weapons . That ends up being a lot of random. You get a random weapon type, for a somewhat random class (higher chance for current class), with random quality with random traits. The chance of getting that one weapon type with the traits you want, is really low. The randomness and different quality gives you incentive to try out another class after you've found that cool orange weapon for him, but it can also be really frustrating to keep getting items for a class that you do not want to play.\n\nIt should be mentioned that the AI bots are horrible. If a player disconnects, or you're having problems finding people through the matchmaker, you gotta think twice before going on as only 3 people. Playing solo with 3 bots is basically impossible, so if you're not keen on playing with other people, then this game is not for you.\n\nConclusion\nThe game has decent map variety, if you're okay with getting severely worse loot drops. If you aren't okay with that, the game makes up for it with great class diversity and randomly spawned special enemies.

Those rewards, however, are intrinsic to a difficult game. Do not expect this to be a loot driven, MMORPG-esque experience. It isn't. In fact I daresay that if you play this game with loot on the brain, expect to be disappointed. This game is about taking three other people and doing some of the most challenging and visceral melee combat that I've ever encountered in a game. Completion of missions offers the reward of self satisfaction and, sometimes, maybe a piece of loot you can use.\n\n\nThere are five difficulty levels and the differences between each are noticable and substantial. Easy is basically a check to see if you understand mechanics and is good for the first map or two. Normal is a fantastic way to farm your first 10-15 levels. Once you begin playing Hard the hits will begin to hurt and you will run the legitimate risk of having a team wipe. Nightmare introduces friendly-fire and challenges players well up to level 100. Finally, Cataclysm offers the ultimate challenge. In Cataclysm difficulty, just four hits from even the most basic enemy can down your character.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who is interested in the four player co-op genre. Do not purchase this if you're not willing to work together with your fellow players in order to achieve a common goal. Do not purchase this if you're primarily concerned about the weapons/trinkets/items you recieve along the way. Loot isn't a big part of this game, ultimately. DO purchase this game if you enjoyed Chivalry, Dark Souls, or similar challenging melee combat titles. DO purchase if you enjoy being legitimately challenged in a group environment. You will need friends to keep up in Vermintide, and once you're in the zone, the experience is unparalled.","March 28","true","639.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I don't always want to play games with real people, but with this game's difficulty and poor Ai its just a waste of my time. Expect to find yourself with twice as many kills as the next closest Ai and still lose, over and over. Ai doesn't pick up Tomes, Ai doesn't heal itself properly, Ai doesn't prioritize saving you when you go down, the Ai doesn't care that a Packmaster just spawned behind you and is now dragging you away.\n\nIf and when you finally do begrudgingly make your way through a mission on Normal with Ai, expect your 7 dice RNG game to give you a white item for your time even if you got both grimoires and a tome because hey RNG is fun right guys? Right? Random chance is really fun guys! Well, no... its not, and playing with Ai is frustrating, unfun and unrewarding.\n\nHere are my recommendations for Ai and loot:\nIf they have 30% health and have a health potion, yet are standing next to another health potion on the ground, make them heal and pick up the unused health potion, mother of god. If the design philsophy to make Normal easy is to add lots of health potions, make your Ai take advantage of it.\nPrioritze a downed player over attacking mobs. Why make me sit there and watch for 2 minutes as we lose because the Ai doesn't care?\nGive the player some command, even something simple such as "pick up that item". That's all it needs to be, really.\nThe entire loot system needs revamped, it can be extremely frustrating and not-rewarding because its based on RNG. Even going out of your way in a game with Ai to increase the chance at a green is an infuriating experience.\nWith all that said and in conclusion: don't pick this game up unless you have a solid reliable group of friends who will play it with you for thousands of hours. You're not going to want to play with the Ai because you might as well be playing solo, and It's going to take you a while to get any decent look because the RNG system is unrewarding.\n\nEven so, if you avoid singleplayer and Ai completely, you'll still find yourself running Horn of Magnus over and over because its the only mission worth doing, and how long will you and your friends hold out until you're bored? I think the statistics will confirm these problems.","October 25, 2015","false","25.7"," 79 of 149 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","79","149","2","5"

The GPU performance is even worse , i'm running a r9 390x(not gonna buy an nvidia card so shht) and the Game is using .. uhh 1.5 of my 8GB VRAM .. ye Really. also the Useage of the GPU don't go up with lowering/cranking up the Settings it just stays the same for the Entirety of my Gaming Sessions so is my Temperature . for such an hardware heavy game i Honestly expected more than an Maximum of 53°C after 5 hours for example.\n\nI'm the kind of guy that doesn't really care when it dips into 40 fps because it's still playable yes sure it's annoying but not gamebreaking.\nPeople that don't see it that way might want to wait until the Game/Engine receive a proper overwork aka Patch.\n\nWell ... All in All i got to say i'm having a blast playing this game with Friends and going for the Loot and climbing difficulties together.\nAlready Killed a Good amount of Hours and Vermin with this Game and will Proceed doing So.\n\nONWARDS TO VICTORY! :D","March 26","true","109.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","5"

But that "Curse of the Ratling Gunner" makes me sick, because a lot of games was lost because of it.\n\nCurse is simple:\nIf the ratling gunner spawns with any other special (except globaldier, maybe) and player don't kill it outright - he will be dead. Pack master can drag player all around map, ogre can beat him to death and assasin can ♥♥♥♥ him in any way he want. Bots will just ignore player, trying to kill themselves in the bullet shower. Sometimes they even die earlier.\n\nAnd bots can feel the ratling gunner presence from the other side of the map, which makes me think that points of no return was created just to prevent bots from rushing back.\n\nSomeone can say about multiplayer, but usually random guys are worse than bots. As in any other multiplayer team game. Yes, there is good players on the high difficulties, but do you really want grinding hundreds of hours on the same maps to be accepted by them? Grind here is similar to the old korean MMO - on the "normal" you usually get one random (5 classes, 2 types of attack, 3-6 weapons for each type) white item for the 30-60 mins of playing. For the good nightmare run you will need particular orange for your class, which cost x125 of the same white items.","January 7","false","157.9"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somatization/recommended/235540/","somatization","Donald Trump[NormieRemovalSquad]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somatization/","96 products in account","TL;DR the only difficulty mode that offers any challenge is almost literally impossible. Game has massive bugs and stability problems. Dev's seem very inexperienced. Customer service is ♥♥♥♥. Don't play this game right now.\n\nI used to enjoy this game quite a lot, but the devs seem hell bent on making it the most difficult game possible with little to no reward. The highest difficulty, Cataclysm, is nearly impossible for like 97% of the player base (check achievements) and Cataclysm is the only reliable way to get the best loot, which is a shame because you need more luck than skill to conquer Cataclysm maps with any frequency. Every difficulty up to Cataclysm is a joke and Cataclysm is absolutely brutal. You need a team of people with high end gear and who know every trick for the map in order to even have a chance and then, the game might randomly spawn Assassins (think Jockey from L4D2) as a sort of "♥♥♥♥ you". This can happen in the first 3 minutes or the last 10 seconds, literally.\n\nThe game has several bugs that make it even more difficult and unreliable, such as randomly dying for no reason whatsoever, invisible rats at times, rats that don't care about walls/objects/height differences and will glitch to attack you, etc.\n\nFinally, their first "DLC" that they released was free, which was great and added some much needed features in order to adjust the stats and perks on your weapons. Then they released a hold out, wave style map. Cool. They teasted their next DLC for a while and made it known that it would be paid, but released no further details. Upon release, it was the exact same wave style mechanics as the previous one, but in a different map. It offered nothing new other than a different location that in no way changed how you played the game. I felt as though this was an extremely poor move by the developers. Instead of focusing on perfecting the current content and removing stability, balancing and various glitches, they released free DLC then basically a paid version of it that offered nothing new in any way. Great.\n\nOn top of that, their customer support is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing awful. At one point I had an older i7 SLI Laptop that ran the game fine, but would often crash. No matter what settings I tried to run the game with, I got the exact same crash every time. I compiled all of the information as requested, typed everything out that I could and made a support ticket, marked "Critical". It took them 3 or 4 days to get back to me, which is fine. They offered a solution, but as I was busy with other things, I did not get to test it for a day and a half before they closed my ticket. The solution changed nothing and was literally "This game does not support SLI. Disable it", which in my ticket I stated I had already attempted. So, I opened another ticket and then waited 2 and a half weeks for any response whatsoever. In that time I just bought a new desktop and continued to play on that instead of the laptop. Eventually they got back to me and offered more advice, which did indeed help, but not completely.\n\nOverall, the developers seem to be extremely new to this whole "make game, foster community" sort of thing. I love difficult games that make me work for every single victory. I love increasing my skill. However, this game comes down far more to pure luck than it does skill. You can do absolutely everything perfectly and still lose because the game seemingly just says "Hey, ♥♥♥♥ you, you're not winning this map". No reward, nothing, just try again. Cataclysm is the only difficulty mode that offers any sort of challenge for myself or my friends and sadly, most of the community experiences great difficulty on "Hard", which is one step above "Normal". Above hard is Nightmare, which very few players have ever beaten and above that, Cataclysm. Even fewer people have been able to beat a single map of that, let alone every map.

As other reviews have stated, playing alone or with a friend sucks. Bots suck too bad to make the game enjoyable and farming for loot is only fun if it's rewarding; you'll be 70 before getting a rare item.\n\nUnless you have a full team of 4, the game is quite literally hell in most scenarios.\nAlso.. weapons.\nDwarf has very limited choices when it comes to weapons, the hammer feels too weak and the 2 handed axe fails to be useful when a shield is quite literally the best thing in the game.\n\nI wanted this game to be good, but sadly for myself this just feels like a lazy attempt at reviving the left 4 dead niche genre. Sadly i'll keep playing it when I can get people online with me, because despite the fact it lacks in a lot of ways, smashing rats in the face feels good.","November 7, 2015","false","11.8"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","15","26","0","0"

Furthermore most maps feature boring design and you will soon end up grinding that one map that doesnt suck and gives you quick rewards. Classes do not posses any skills which would further differentiate them from one another. Unfortunatly also a pure button masher and not a great melee combat sytem like in dark messiah. A lot of potential unused... Oh and did I mention picking up barrels as objective in almost every level is ♥♥♥♥ing boring? Oh and not to mention crashes (yup you just ♥♥♥♥ed your party, thx random crash, and nope you wont rejoin cause someone will join the game in your stead as you can't reserve single slots) and horrible performance on some maps/ and certain effects. Oh and who doesnt want to get butt♥♥♥♥ed by rng at the end of a hard level receiving the same loot with all bonus enhancers you would receive on the lowest difficulty. Also there are several ways to cheese the levels atm which are heavily being abused by the community, which lead to a huge gap in gear for those who do not make use of the possibilites the game currently offers. There are levels where you can completly block enemy spawns no matter what the difficulty level and which are just broken in their current state. Also there are several bugs (e.g. resolution reset on startup) and more crashes than i think are acceptable for a launch title. Just to give a comparison: In the past 5 years not one launch title I played crashed as many times as warhammer did! Sry for the long rant there are of course also things I like about the game but I think the other reviews cover that in enough detail, overall I still would hold of and wait for the game to either be patched some more or on sale, as I do not think they will be able to fix the design issues any time soon.","October 23, 2015","false","29.0"," 50 of 94 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","50","94","0","2"

The theme with the Scaven is inventive, usually developers are lazy and go Orcs or Chaos, so a change of pace is nice.\nHowever, everything other than the universe and theme simply feels unfinished,\nFirst off, framerate is a huge issue. I cannot get the game to stabilize at 60fps no matter what I do (within reason, I wont go below 1920x1080). Hovers around the upper 50s most of the time, plummets to mid 40s whenever there are more than 4 enemies on the screen. Not only that, but the game looks awful. I was not expecting much, but mostly everything except the lighting looks dated. Skypboxes are awful and anything at a distance is just ugly, hell, even most things right up in your face are ugly (weapons are the exception). Animations are sloppy at best, terrbile at worst. And the "weight" to melee that you've seen mentioned in all the previews is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It simply feels disconnected, like your clicks are only good for turning models of enemies into ragdolls.\nI love the variety of Scave, it rare to find a game where the PR-hype of "no enemies look the same" has a basis in truth. You won't see the same models, or at least notice them very often, unless it is special enemies (Stormvermin, Gunner, Ratogre, etc.). But at the same time, they do look rather terrible. I do not know if the animations or the character models are worse, or if everything is just dragged down by the framerate, but the game just doesn't look good.\nAI is also a huge issue, you can visibly see the range at which enemies react to your presence (about 10 meters or so). Once they react, their reactions are just not very interesting, they usually run straight for you, sometimes get stuck. Once they are just right infront of you, they pause, and then do an attack. They do not feel aggressive, more like sheep going to slaughter. The exceptions are the specials, these feel more dangerous, but still, they don't seem "responsive".\nWith that said, the game is far from easy. I failed the first map on all 3 of my tries on Normal with a team that actually seemed to stick together. We were not excellent, but not bad, and the game still got us. This did not feel unfair though, so that is a plus.\nOne last nitpick: You pass through friendly characters. Now, this is not a mortal sin, but it just feels sloppy and irksome. I understand that there would be chokes where the player characters just get stuck on each other if there was collision detection on the characters, but they should have designed the game with this in mind.\nAs I mentioned, I only played 3 matches, so keep that in mind. But as I intend to refund the game, I can't justify spending more time with it.\nAnother 6 months in development and the game might have been ok. Now it is subpar.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to clarify that my system is "ok" at worst. I run an i7 3770k, GTX 970 ad 16 gb ram. I think that it is not unrealistic to expect the game to be chugging along at a stable 60fps with this system.","October 23, 2015","false","1.7"," 52 of 98 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","52","98","2","8"

I had a number of hours played as the dwarf and man at arms, and after probably 20 or so hours I finally started getting some orange weapons....and they were all Bright Wizard staffs!  At first I was peeved but relented and started playing as the BW, turns out she is super fun!  Well worth $30 and a bunch of fun if you have friends.\n\nQuite a challange as well.

More Melee focused first Person however you do have a secondary weapon which is ranged and very important for taking out special units in troublesome situations.\n\nUnlike L4D there is a actual reason to keep playing for more than just teamwork, LOOT! Zombies are replaced by Skaven (Rat creatures for the uninformed) as you pass through the level you pick items that heal, make you more powerful, ammo and items that give you better chances of da good loot at the end of the game. At the end of the game you roll dice and the number of successful diced roll determines the quality of the loot you receive.\n\nEach race/character has access to race/char specific weapons, those weapons are (Mostly) unique weapons stats/characteristics, so each characater has its own specific play style as well which makes the game unique and replayable.\n\nGreat game, especially if you love the Warhammer. Even if you don't give two hoots about warhammer you will still love this game as it is essential that your team coops throughout to be able to complete the levels especially on difficulty levels Nightmare and Above. A breath of fresh air as most games seem said to be designed for coop end up lonewolf encouraging. There is also no benefit in knowing the lore in the Warhammer universe as it the gameplay and skill in blocking that determines players skill.\n\nThe game has its occasional bug and you do on rare occasions (like all games) have the odd idiot, however there is a kick player function (thankfully rarely used).\n\nThe game is also very reasonably priced at $30 (USD) and much to my surprise these days no day one DLC!\n\nBuy it.

Vermines, Skavens, rats, beings of the underworld or whatever you'd like to call them decides to invade the city of Ubersreik, and the heroes are there to drive them back to their underworld, while killing their families, burning their homes, nuking their cities and eradicating their existance on the way.\n\nThis game, like what many others have said, is very similar to that of Left 4 Dead 2 in terms of game-play, though there are apparent differences as well. You have two type of major weapons, melee and ranged. Both weapons vary depending on which of the 5 classes you chose. Some are versatile killers while others are ranged experts or indispensable tanks which can keep the whole team safe. The missions are similar to those of L4D2 as well, with half of them being campaigns where you have to venture into a place and clear a finale event before evacuating in a wagon-like transport, while the other halves are some defense or smaller event missions. Eneimes are similar as well, with hordes of small and weak rats, special rats with various attrabutes such as pouncing, strangling, gattling guns or toxic gases. There'll be a tank-like boss called rat ogre where the whole team has to gang up to defeat him, and the patrol armored rats where the team will have to hide while they move away, avoding their attention.\n\nThere is a leveling and weaponary system in the game as well. The levels means nothing except that they will award you with a new weapon (a rather weak one) with ever level you gained. The are no stats involved for the characters, such as strength or intellegence. The major prupose of the game lies in the weaponary system. At the end of each successful mission, be it the major campaings or smaller event missions, you will have a number of dice which you'll try to roll for better weapons. There is also a weaponary system where you can rank up your weapons or unlock skills for your weapons.\n\nThe game itself is not easy, though after a few days of gaming and a few trusted friends you should be able to handle higher difficulties. There are 5 levels of difficulties, though you can increase the difficulty of your game (if you are playing a campaign) by looking for and holding on to tomes and grimoires, of which the former will take up a health potion spot, while the latter a boosting potion spot and reducing the team's health points by a third.\n\nAgain, similar to L4D2, this game requires cooperative gameplay, so this is definitely a go if can gather enough friends (you need four players) who can gather together and play on a regular basis, as you'll most likely find rushers who will rush out, get pinned, die, and leave you with nothing but fustration.\n\nP.S. The ending is kind of skimpy, though it's really not the whole purpose of playing this game, so I'll leave it for you to figure it out yourself.","February 14","true","82.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is in my opinion honestly better than left 4 dead as there is more to it than shooting at faceless characterless hordes of targets. Instead it’s a game about pitting you and your friends against an enemy that is beautifully brought to life as scheming, backstabbing, wimpy and yet charming race of rat men.\n\nIt brings to life a great world and characters that is just enough to draw you in and yet leaves enough mystery to entice you to go deeper into the lore through other mediums (which is just a testament to the talent of Fatshark and is a huge boon to Games workshop, so if nothing else GM should be throwing cash at this in my biased opinion :D ).\n\nIts down side, in my opinion, are the bugs, the optimisation and the bots. But neither of these are game breaking in my experience and I have actively seen improvements. But be a smart consumer and do look into specs and performance reviews before you buy.\n\nSo I feel this is a great game!

Mood of the game crafted through fitting environments and lighting and an atmosphere-driving sound design. From the tell-tale sounds of unique skaven presence to the get-hyped percussive insistence of a rat ogre fight, I felt immersed and invested in the state of hte characters. So much so that straying from the main path to obtain a tome or two gave me pause.\n\nIt might not be good that the mechanics of this game draw heavily from the acclaimed L4D series, but it definitely is not a bad thing. The whole pitchforking re: it's a X clone, shouldn't dissuade you from trying the game out. I believe with sincere development, making a game after a "formula" will still yield unique experiences. The combat feels satisfying and the unique skavens, while reminiscent of special infected, feel and adds positively to the gameplay. Thematically it definitely earns a place in my heart!\n\nFull disclosure though; While not having owned any warhammer tabletop sets, the fantasy (and its 40k cousin) universe has always enthralled me, so I definitely enjoyed another venture into this setting. I am also curious about 3rd party game engines and the fact that Vermintide was built on Autodesk's Stingray definitely piqued my interest.\n\nProbably the biggest downer is the demanding toll it puts on my laptop (middling i7 with a GTX970). Granted it is not a custom-built powerhouse but I think there can be some safeguards in place that prevents the repeated overheating and crash-to-shutdown occurrences. I did come across suggestions to circumvent the abovementioned on reddit but having to trawl the web for compromises should not be the case. Optimization is a ongoing battle waged by the devs and I do wish them luck on that front as it will heavily affect playerbase growth that is critical for a co-operative game such as this.","May 28","true","11.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game has its problems, and it can be a grind, and the population is failing a little, but it's still a pretty solid package.  Most negative reviews seem to be along the lines of;\n\n"Well I used to play this a lot, but it has gotten repetitive, and there isn't enough content, too much grind, etc."\n\nThese complaints seem to stem from the fact that this game's genre can be a little misleading.  There's loot and some progression, which means that a lot of people are going to get autistic about this game, treat it like an MMO, grind for 100 hours of game time, and then complain that all the grind has gotten them no where.\n\nIf you play with the "I need to get more loot" mentality in focus, you're probably not going to have as much fun.  Loot is there to complement your growth in skill to help you beat the harder difficulties, which can be extremely challanging.  It shouldn't be your goal post, and the fact that it is for a lot of people in the community is the game's biggest detractor.\n\nDon't be like those tools who have Horn of Magnus (one of the first missions) down to a science and play it over and over for the easy loot.  Play this game in short bursts with some friends, or even with people you find online, and you'll find it a very enjoyable take on the Left4Dead formula.

Essentially Vermintide places you in the fantasy Warhammer setting and has you fighting your way from point A to point B, using a combination of melee and ranged weapons to survive attacks along the way. Your melee attacks work really well, with a good dodge/push/block/charged attack  system in place. The ranged weapons rely heavily upon finding ammunition so you need to use with care, but there are a wide range of weapons, each with their own strengths. Melee is definitely the focus however. In some ways it may seem similar to KF_Damnation, but dont let this put you off. I hate damnation, but really enjoy this.\nWhat I really like is the reward system. You level up and receive new weapons and gear by successfully completing maps/missions. At the end of the mission, you roll a set of dice, and the more successful dice rolls, the better weapon or gear you will be rewarded with. The weapon goes into your inventory pool, and you can either equip it to the appropriate perked character, or you can 'mess' with it some more. "Messing' with it can be done in several ways. Firstly, you can try and change the weapons traits. I should explain. Weapons have bonus traits on them. For example, traits may give you healing when you hit something, or provide the chance of an instant kill, faster attack speed, leech ammo etc. There is also a percentage chance applied to this trait, so for example, my flame sword has a 10% chance of healing me for 5 hp when I hit something. So I can roll some dice and try and change the trait to a some other ability that I would like, or, roll a dice and try and improve the percentage associated with the current trait. It costs a few tokens to do this. Alternatively you can meld 5 weapons of one particular level, into 1 weapon of a higher quality. The final way to mess with the weapons is just to 'salvage' them and convert them to tokens. These tokens can be used to reroll traits on existing weapons, or be used to create entirely new weapons if you'd rather.\nI should also add that the quality of the weapon/loot item you receive at the end of the mission can be influenced by picking up 'tomes' and 'grimoires' during play. These give your end of game dice a better chance of successful rolls, but make the mission harder by limiting your healing options and maximum health throughout. Essentially they allow you to set your risk/reward level as you play. Brilliant!\nI really like that there is a real tangible reward for completing missions. Unlike with KF1/KF2, there is no level cap (that I am are aware of) so you can keep improving your 'cred' if that's important to you. More importantly though, you keep getting weapon/gear drops so can keep modifying and crafting new gear, forever improving and honing your characters loadout.\nThere are 5 perk/classes at the moment, but it feels like only 3 really. Each has basically 4 main melee and 4 main ranged weapons each for you to choose from, but as stated before, you can customise those with different traits to your liking.\nThe environments are great. Detailed, atmospheric, balanced; though there is not a huge amount of maps just yet. Some people will find this a bit repetitive but I'm not minding it so far. Shame there is no option for custom maps at this stage, but the quality of the developer maps would be hard to measure up to anyways. There is a good variety of enemies, and while OP at times, usually they can be dealt with providing team work remains the focus.\nThere is no dedicated server yet, so peeps can hop into your game at any time unless you designate your game as private. Good and bad I guess. Scenes can get pretty busy at times when you are facing a horde so my internet struggles when hosting. If you play on your own while waiting for someone to jump in, bots will take control of your other characters to help out along the way. They are not infallible for sure, and sometimes will run away and hide, or stand by doing nothing while you slowly bleed to death, but with care, they can be utilised reasonably effectively.\nAll in all, this game gives you a Killing Floor like team game, with an awesome setting and a great motivation/reward system. Recommended.","February 14","true","222.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Well this is the game for you.\n\nSeriously, it's about time someone took the L4D formula and improved upon it. This game is pretty much exactly what you would want from a L4D-inspired game. The basic formula is the same but there's so many improvements that make it more refreshing to play. Also the difficulty is much higher. It's much harder to protect yourself against all incoming threats, the chances of you not taking damage are very unlikely.\n\nSatisfying melee combat, effective but limited range capabilities. That's more so the kind of game this is in comparison to Left 4 Dead. There's much more emphasis on melee combat, and you'll really want to save your ranged ammo for special enemies. Funnily enough, this game has its own version of the Smoker/Jockey, the Hunter, the Spitter, and the Tank,\n\nThe Smoker-like enemy grabs you from a range much like a Smoker, but he drags you away from your team much like a Jockey. The Hunter-like enemy pounces you, but is capable of teleportation in order to escape. The Spitter-like enemy is much more threatening than a Spitter, as he throws acid jars that cover huge distances and is capable of throwing more than 1. The Tank-like enemy is pretty much the exact same as its L4D counterpart, big huge brute that takes A LOT of damage, while punching and knocking people away from it. The difference though is that in this game, you can block his punches with melee weapons, which while still deals damage to you, it prevents knockback.\n\nEach character you can play as has specific weapon types they can use, and you can change between any of them at any time. You can mix, salvage, and upgrade weapons respectively. You get weapon drops from completing levels via dice rolls. You can improve your chances of good dice rolls by picking up Tomes in the level, which take up your medkit slot. So you have to do some risk and reward stuff. Get better rewards by going without a medkit, or play it save and bring a medkit with you.\n\nOverall, there's a lot more to this game, and I really hope they continue to support it with more content in the future. There's so much they can do with it, and I hope they don't waste their opportunities like Valve did with Left 4 Dead.\n","October 16, 2015","true","5.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

I have a suspicion that the odd hit boxes and other small moments in the game that make things more difficult are partly intentional.

Chivalry esque combat, L4D style groupings and special enemies, D&D esque loot rolling and RPG item tiers. It takes all of these elements and blends them in a unique and enjoyable package. It is highly recommended to play with other people online because the bots are not the best, as expected in a coop game. The levels are unique and satisfying, especially when you collect the special items to increase loot like the Tomes or Skaven Grimoires.

I had fun playing through the various missions and trying out the different heroes, hence the thumbs up.\n\nBut, well, the loot-driven gameplay got boring fast...the fact you're at the mercy of rolls not only for loot quality but also its type means you can end up with good stuff for a character you don't like playing: this happened to me, I like playing a tanky Dwarf but never got anything for him, well not anything tank oriented and at least green....so I played the Wizard due to having a blue staff and green sword drop for it. Sure you can try and repeat missions or fuse items in the forge but, once again, you'll need to be lucky and, considering the huge amount of different items available, it might take quite some time.\n\nIn the end trying missions over and over, either on Normal or on Hard (where the community gets way more edgy), got dull and slightly frustrating: there's only so much time I can spend chasing the carrot dangling in front of me.\n\nVermintide is a decent and quite fun game, having got it for 18$ I'm happy with the 20ish hours I got out of it but all prospective buyers'd consider the loot system and their tolerance for it before hitting the Buy button.","October 30, 2015","true","18.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

If you are a fan of games like Payday, Left 4 dead, or killing floor, then you will love this one. Combat is mostly focused around blocking, shoving, and hacking at the rats trying to end your adventure.\n\nSpecial skavens still act very buggy as of the last day of beta. Ratogre can be bugged, making him extremely easy to kill. Gutter runners still do their insane teleport and dunkmaster pounces. Ratling gunners can still shoot through walls on some levels, and Packmasters are still overpowered (undodgable grab and their movespeed while dragging is too high). There are still some issues with optimization, while I am able to play just fine, others have mentioned lots of frame drops during the "events". Still some crashing, usually about 1 in 20 games, much better than the closed beta for sure, but still too many.\n\nCombat works well, you can almost feel the impact of your weapons on the skaven. The game rewards team play so much more than lone wolfing, which is exactly how a game like this should work. Music is solid and sound effects are terrific. Devs seems to really care about the game, I think they know they have a hit here and want it to do well. Teams can have many different strategies, min/maxing will happen but thankfully the devs did not make the good items rediculously overpowered, you still need skill to win at the higher difficulties.\n\nTough to continue playing after a while. The crafting system and achievements can keep you motivated, but ultimately a game like this survives on new maps and new gametypes. Hopefully we will see some further development in that direction.

The Ai of these creatures, is just meh, cannot say a single positive aspect about it.\n\nGraphics are extremly good in my opinion, but the optimization is beyond bad. it seems none of the options has impact on the fps. For me, the FPS drops are identical on the lowest to medium settings. FPS drops usually followed by a big game slowdown, causes a huge input lag, and driving me crazy.\n\nMaps are well designed, and looking awsome, but there are only 12. (?)\n\nThe Networking. This is when the ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan. No hostmigration, No dedicated servers, why ?\nImo, the dedicated servers won't solve the problem. P2P is not as bad as most of the community thinks. I only played l4d in P2P, and it was awsome. My buddies are close to me, so everybody got like 10-30 ms delay, which is fantastic, and everything worked smoothly. However, in Vermintide, even with the same ppl, the delays are insane. The fact that a lot of different rules apply to the host and the guests is bad. When you are playing as a host, the game is great, everything smooth, everything works just as expected. When you are a guest (even with very low ping), first you will start to notice the delays, which is like increasing through the game, and then, the thing that are never happening as a host, like getting hit while pushing, dodge seems a 50 - 50 game as a guest, and a tons of hittrades, which again, doesn't happen when you are the host. Some guy on the forums actually mentioned, that even in lan, the host - guest difference is very noticable, because the game is not synchronizing properly.\n\nThere are a millions of bugs that influencing every map you play, just like cannot help your teamate up, because he sank into the textures, getting hit while using potion/nade, sometimes multiplies it, and there are a tons of other bugs that i could mention. That's why i gave a negative review, because they seem to not care about those problems and bugs that i mention above, but they are forcing the console version, and "so-called new", recycled content.\n\nAbout the game's difficulty. I've seen that a lot of people complaining, because it's too hard, which the achievment charts kinda approves, but it's really not that hard. If you played l4d on expert realism, you know what can you expect on cataclysm. After 350 hours, I usually fight with the bugs and the netcode inconsistencies rather then the rats.\n\nAgain, the game has a great concept, characters, maps, lore everything is fine, except the optimalization and netcode, which is far below avarage.","May 14","false","368.8"," 96 of 185 people (52%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","52","96","185","5","14"

Slowly, my enjoyment was brought down by two things and two things alone\n\nFirst and foremost, is of course, loot.  The game has loot.  It wants you to get loot.  But it doesn't want to give you loot.  It wants you to run the same map 30 times to get something that might make the game a small bit easier.  For me, I dealt with it, but it certainly impacted my enjoyment of the game.\n\nSecond, it doesn't use the AI director that was so intelligent in L4D.  The AI director in Vermintide will randomly decide, you need to die.  In the first 30 seconds in one game, 3 packmasters and an ogre were dropped on us.  We hadn't even fought our first horde yet.  This wasn't a response to use being so good, this was it just suddenly deciding we needed to die.\n\nIn another game, we received two specials the entire time.  Only two.  There is no guidance to how it decides to spawn it's forces.  This isn't a DM who wants to see you struggle and prevail.  This is Dewey with a shovel standing over your anthill.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reddington/recommended/235540/","Reddington","Reddington","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reddington/","214 products in account","Vermintide is a fantastic game. When all you need is some visceral, powerful violence, this game delivers fully. This game offers a Left 4 Dead type of on-the-move, hoard based gameplay with a gritty melee combat, a looting and equipment system, 13 maps and 5 difficulty settings, 5 classes, and tons of loot to find. Vermintide is a well-crafted game with a combat system that keeps you coming back, bloodthirsty for more rats to kill.\n\nBut I can hardly recommend it.\n\nWhile the combat system is competent, though iterative, the combat alone does not carry the game. This game suffers from a myriad of problems that really hamper it and obstruct your enjoyment of the game.\n\nFirst off, optimization. It's awful. To save space, I'll at least say I'm running a mid to high range system with an AMD R9 280x, and even on the absolute LOWEST setting, I regularly experience sub-30 FPS. Looking on Reddit and the forums, many others suffer from performance issues, especially other AMD users. This alone gives me enough reason to not recommend the game - to push the game out so quickly out of early access when it could hardly play is a bit of a disgrace. But it doesn't end there.\n\nSecond, the loot system. It is not uncommon to play for dozens of hours and not get a single new weapon for your main class. You get one piece of gear per game, excluding bonuses, and you must roll for a random piece of loot. The issue that comes with this system is while I can be tolerant of rolling for rarity, the type of equipment you get is entirely independent of the class that you're currently playing. Essentially, morely likely than not, you can expect to get equipment completely useless to you, and it is not uncommon to never get a specific type of equipment that you're looking for for hours on end. While the loot system is a healthy addition to a L4D formula, it's hampered by how flawed and frustrating it could prove to be.\n\nThird, hosting. This game makes the same mistake that Payday 2 did - making the game entirely dependent on the connection of the host. Should the host disconnect, the whole game ends. Game crashes because,  y'know, the game was rushed out and all of the major bugs weren't wiped out? Too bad. Somebody's trolling the entirely team and decides to end the game moments before you escape? That's it for you. At least Warframe gave you a chance with host migration, but this game? Not even the slightest. Irritating doesn't even begin to describe this issue.\n\nFourth, uninspired loot. As if it wasn't bad enough that looting ends up being a massive pain and an unrewarding experience, the rarity and the auments that the weapons could come with are hardly exciting. Remember Diablo 3 on release? Remember how meaningless the gear you find were? Well, this game suffers from the same problem. Augments are often uninspired, boring passives that barely distinguish a rare weapon from a regular common one. 20% to not use stamina when pushing? 5% chance on hit to have a 30% increase in attack speed for 5 seconds? I can barely contain my excitement. Even Blizzard realized how unrewarding their own loot system was before they changed it - I could only hope  that Fatshark realizes the same.\n\nWell, there you have it. This game is barely a good enough romp in the park if you just want a hoard-based, stabbing simulator, but all of these problems present make it unworthy of a full-price purchase. Performance issues aside, the other issues I've listed make this game too frustrating of an experience to appreciate outside of a cheap thrill. My only hope is that these issues be resolved soon, and I will happily change my review to a positive, because for what it's worth, it is a fun game - it just pains me to see all of these issues getting in its way.\n\nEDIT: The loot system since writing this review has been changed. You now have an option of which loot to craft using unwanted loot through a new system available at the inn. However, this does not preclude the issue of boring, uninteresting loot. Even with the advent of red rarity loot, the augments and abilities are STILL dull and uninspired. There is almost literally no difference between an orange and a red weapon aside from their color. And honestly? There was barely a difference between orange and white weapons to begin with.","November 6, 2015","false","44.2"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","13","23","0","0"

I finished all of the missions, campaigns, or whatever you want to call them in 12 hours. The weapons boil down to (this weapon kills large amounts of weak rats) and (this weapon kills the big rats but doesnt kill the large amounts of weak rats). Difficulty is based off of your equipment, although there is some amount of mechanical skill but even less than left 4 dead" so having blue weapons in hard difficulty makes it a cakewalk compared to white weapons. Mechanics look deep at first but boil down into block when you get swarmed and or when a big rat swings at you, then hit them back, then swinging your axe all over the place and clear out large amounts of small rats. The game was loads of fun for the 12 hour length but i dont see myself going back to playing it considering its largely repetative/grindy nature once you complete all the missions.

The melee ranges of the skaven are roughly 5 times as long as they should be. The pathing of enemies is atrocious, and frequently you will have skaven clumping together on top of one another, making a skaven "meatball". Also, good luck killing an ogre when 4-5 skaven clip inside him. Also, the special enemies can hit you through walls no matter how thick they are. Add to that the laggy online play, the severe framerate drops throughout the levels, and you are left with a buggy, unoptimized game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AmazingAssonanceAlex/recommended/235540/","AmazingAssonanceAlex","Doom Cookie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AmazingAssonanceAlex/","392 products in account","TL;DRThe loot system is horrifyingly bad and the special rats feel a bit out of place, but otherwise the game is incredibly fun. You'll love this game if you like at least 2 of the following: Left 4 Dead, fun melee combat, satisfying decapitation, or the thrill of turning garbage loot into slightly less bad loot until you get the really special and amazing stuff.\n\n===\n\nOkay lemme get the one ridiculous, stupid, and enragingly awful feature out of the way: the loot system. It sucks - really, really badly. I don't think it is humanly possible to devise something that should be awesome and rewarding in a way that could be any worse than the loot system in this game. It really is very bad.\n\nThe way it works is you are given 7 dice. These are not dice that have numbers on them; they either increase a point on your loot, or they don't (so, in other words, they have either a 0 or a 1). Normally, you have 7 dice that have a 2 in 6 chance of landing on the 1. However, there are 3 types of dice that you can find to replace some of the normal dice.\n\nYou can find "loot dice" by exploring the maps, but the presence of these is totally random; they have a 3 in 6 chance of landing on the 1. Or, you can find hidden tomes that provide a 4 in 6 chance; these take up the health slot in-game while you're carrying them, so one person has to neglect any health potions or health kits while carrying the tome. Finally, you can find grimoires that always roll a 1. However, these take up a potion slot (potions can be used to get either temporary strength or speed, and neither are incredibly useful) but more importantly they take away 30% of your entire team's health.\n\nThere are usually about 3 tomes and 2 grimoires in every map; that means that if you have found them all (they are somewhat hidden) and you are carrying them all, by the end of the map you are missing 3 potential health items you could carry and your entire team's max health has fallen to 40% of what it is normally.\n\nAt the end of the level, the dice are rolled and your total is added up. The number of dice that landed favorably get you to better, higher-quality loot (even if you roll none, you still get something, which I guess is nice). Furthermore, playing on a higher difficulty increases the quality of potential loot. For instance, playing a map on normal lets you get one of either a lot of whites or some greens or a blue on the highest roll; on hard, the same map provides the chances of either a lot of greens, some blues, or an orange on the highest roll.\n\nSo here's the one reason that more than any other this loot system sucks. I was playing a mission on hard (I was playing with a new guy, and there's an appreciable difference between normal and hard, so we really had to work at it). We found two loot dice, three tomes, and a grimoire. It takes a lot of effort and time to do all that, especially on hard. I complete the mission, I roll a 2, and I got a green item. That means for a lot more time, difficulty, and effort, I got the same loot that I would've gotten doing the same mission on normal and ignoring the tomes and grimoires and if I got a decent roll.\n\nWhen I play and get loot, instead of feeling rewarded, I feel taunted. It's horrible and stupid and I'm honestly not sure how anyone could have possibly let it into the game.\n\nEspecially because the rest of the game is just good fun. There is intersting loot to be had, and there are ways to craft it even if you do only get loot that you hate. The new Sigmar's Blessing content makes the game much more fun and the loot much more interesting, and I'm under the impression that the developers are going to continue giving out more free content. That's awesome!\n\nThe melee combat feels awesome, and the ranged combat is pretty cool. The special rats all feel like an afterthought and don't really belong. Often times several assassins or pack rats (I don't remember their actual names :P) will appear at the same time and wipe out the whole team (this is the equivalent of several teleporting hunters and melee-smokers that you can't shoot, in L4D terms). The pack rats are especially odd because they work by hooking you with a long pole, and dragging you around. You can't do anything about it, and your teammates' best weapons are in melee. Because there is no sprinting, the result is a bizarre chase while they try to catch up to the rat, who is only slightly slower. It doesn't change the dynamic, or make you switch positions, or anything like that; it's just kinda annoying and feels out of place.\n\nRat ogres and poison globers also feel pretty out of place. The ogre essentially just requires being hit a lot, and in my opinion they take waaaay too long to die. Not fun, doesn't change the tactics really, just kinda is annoying and can sometimes wreck a half-hour progress for no avoidable reason. The globers throw poison at you to try to cause you to disperse, but the maps are clearly not designed with this guy in mind; the result is extrememly annoying and not fun or interesting. The same is not true, however, for the assassins or ratling gunners, which are genuinely fun and require a bit of changing tactics.\n\nOverall, I feel that the way the different "specials" spawn is just slightly off. You can go a long time without any showing up, and all of a sudden you get swarmed by two gunners and three assassins. Sometimes, on normal, an entire mission would go by without any ogres (thank goodness). Other times on normal, three appeared in the same mission.\n\nThe fantastic melee and the interesting later-on loot make up, however, for all these gripes. The loot system is infuriating, but I usually just remind myself that I'll use it primarily just to make the gear that I want. Grab friends, play it. Despite all this complaining, the rest of the game really is fun enough to make up for all this.","December 24, 2015","true","25.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Getting loot for other heroes can be annoying but encourages playing multiple roles instead of a singular focus. The range of weapons and styles is great. My only issues stem from engine troubles like how skaven seemed to be at times hitting far beyond the weapons they carry or through walls.

Vermintide adds a bit of depth to characters by means of a tavern where players can forge weapons, pray to upgrade their items and manage the inventory. It's a repetitive experience, with barely 13 co-op missions, but thanks to character development, a satisfying combat system, some challenging difficulty levels and a load of nerve-wrecking rat ogres it certainly manages to stay fresh. It gets better with voice chat and some friends.\n\nAnd when I say it's a Left 4 Dead rip-off, I mean it: after dying, characters appear trapped a bit further away, even with a red halo around them...

Before age of sigmar buggered the franchise like an ogre on cataclysm, we had a world of amazing dark fantasy. The aesthetic and presentation is wonderful for me, i like the loot system, it keeps the game interesting. Getting loot for other heroes can be annoying but encourages playing multiple roles instead of a singular focus. The range of weapons and styles is great. My only issues stem from engine troubles like how skaven seemed to be at times hitting far beyond the weapons they carry or through walls. Stab through blocks or worse just clipping  through walls behind your team and dealing that ever so annoying rear stab.\n\nEven with such issues, that cannot be understated. The detail and passion that has gone into this game is amazing. Hopefully dlc/ flc will expand the heroes and levels with maybe a few tweaks to the loot for good measure.

It draws a lot of inspiration from fellow great games, all while developing its own personality and cornerstones of what a great game should be.\nThe loot progression is fair and rewarding, and does not promote competetiveness. In the many lobbies I have been in, the community has constantly fostered teamwork that is not seen in many other cooperative games, which allows for a more immersive and enjoyable experience.\nThe difficulty is challenging but rewarding, and the various settings extend the games lifespan in a meaningful way. Changin things like base damage is all well and fine, but the addition of more storm vermin to a patrol and other such tweaks really change the way the game plays as you progress in the difficulty settings.\nBefore this game, I had never heard of the developers. But from the road mapping of additional content, to the small details in things like paintings that add a nice touch of immersion, to the way they tackle bugs and treat their customer base with care, I would be more than willing to purchase future games with the same roadmapping.\nOverall, there are many warhammer games out there, but this is definitely a game to pick up for the reasonable $33 (canadian).","October 25, 2015","true","135.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Though the lore is there and it is fun to explore if you are a big Warhammer fan you don't need to know it to have a blast in the game. If you wish to play this game to learn the lore though, it is there.\n\nThis game has a playstyle very similar to Left 4 Dead 2, and you may dicredit this game for closely resembling if not copying that series. Though seeing as not many games are FPS melee horde I think it deserves a pass.\n\nThis game offers about 10-15 missons all of which get harder as you go on. Personally I haven't beat the final boss because that misson is just way too hard without friends. Some have complained that a lot of objectives in the missons are just rehashes of objectives from previous missons. Yes, you have to move black powder a lot, but the difficulty and lnviroment are so different that you soon ignore the "Oh wait, I have done this before". I personally believe that the different locations you explore and the just shear fun and challenge is enough for hundreds of gameplay.\n\nNow, the loot system. The loot system at first was kind of a joke, but with the latest updates it added a big variety. The way you aquire loot is 2 ways: Leveling up and completing a misson and rolling dice. The first one is pretty self explanitory, but the second. If you were to complete a misson without doing anything extra you get to roll dice that only have a 1/6 or 2/6 chance of rolling a face side. If you roll a face side you go up the loot chart wich gets you better loot. Though as you complete a misson you can pick up risky, but rewarding tomes and Grimore. These are hidden on most maps and take place of potions and healing supplies in your inventory. Grimores reduce your health by about 33% for each one you have and this applies to your entire team, but you will get a dice at the end that ALWAYS rolls a side. This basically makes you think in a "risk vs. reward" way. As for types of loot it goes White (common), Green (uncommon), Blue (rare), and Orange (legendary). With each tier you get a ability that you can upgrade to unlock legendaries of course have 3 abilities and have better stats, but they are harder to upgrade.\n\nThis game is unique and such a blast even by yourself the one huge downside that could be a deal breaker is that if you lose connection to Steam while in a game with other people it instantly kicks you and the people playing with you get locked in some dumb blackscreen. Though this is rare to happen and can be avioded it is by far the worst and most annoying thing that can happen.\n\n[9/10] Though this game isn't blowing up the media it defenitley does what is does very well and with friends you can easily get a hundred hours out of this game.\n\n~Chryssy","December 14, 2015","true","18.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

And now that I finished the campaign (at least in normal), I think I can offer some good impressions.\n\nVermintide offers a Left 4 Dead gameplay style in the Warhammer Fantasy setting, which is absolutely cool, because you get to go melee on waves and waves of skavens and that's fun.\nDoing it on your own is not thaaaat fun, it is enjoyable if you wanted the game as bad as I did, so try at least to be in league with another friend, or well, try your luck in the online lobbies.\n\nThe game offers 5 playable characters, each with their own set of weapons. Leveling up each character just unlocks equipment space for trinkets.\nAt the end of each level you get to roll some dices, which determine a piece of random loot that you get (also, loot comes with different types of rarity).\nIf you crank up the game's difficulty, the best items you can get at the end of the level.\nSpread in the most important levels there are some loot dices and tomes and grimoires, items that will generate better loot dice for the after level roll, but that will cost you inventory space and health.\n\nThe game itself is kinda challenging, if you have played L4D you will know that you have to keep moving, standing in a single point will not help you, skavens will eventually overrun you.\nAs it happens with L4D, there are some special skavens that spawn across the levels and that will pester you while you travel across the maps. You have the rat ogre (tank), the globadier (spitter), the gutter runner (hunter), the pack master (smoker), the rattling gunner (armored rat with a huge gun) and the stormskaven (packs of armored skavens).\nIf you played L4D, the first ones will be easily recognizable.\n\nIn terms of graphics, the games looks really nice, even when I got to turn some options down due to the volume of skavens present in the screen.\nAs far as I have played, I had no problems in connecting with a friend to play, and we were able to enjoy the campaign in normal difficulty.\nTaking into account that there are some story missions and some side missions, the game still feels rather short in those terms, but playing each level in higher difficulties is what will make your experience last longer.\nIf you are here looking for an immersive story, I'm affraid this is not your game. If you like to bludgeon rat men for hours searching for loot and stuff at higher difficulties again and again and again, this is what you need.\n\nThe developers should seriously consider releasing some sort of expansion packs with more missions like L4D, or a mode where you can play as Skaven in a match vs the Heroes.","January 1","true","23.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've played left 4 dead and some others but it was nothing more than playing with friends on split screen. Now I have 140 hours spent in vermintide and I am completely into it. I even gave a break to my main mmo so I can keep making skaven cry. I am in love with warhammer fantasy roleplay setting and I can say without hesitation that in here its done god damn right. Great game to play solo and join random players and even greater if you have steady team. Gear progression and earning it makes it even better and satisfaying. It's not easy when you play trough your first runs and learn maps but after you earn enough experience and knowledge you can jump into nightmare / cataclysm experience which is real essence of vermintide and keeps you busy. Developers also did perfect job with voice acting and gave each character different, far from plane personalities. Even now when I've completed most maps on cataclysm, I still want to play it daily for many hours.

It draws a lot of inspiration from fellow great games, all while developing its own personality and cornerstones of what a great game should be.\nThe loot progression is fair and rewarding, and does not promote competetiveness. In the many lobbies I have been in, the community has constantly fostered teamwork that is not seen in many other cooperative games, which allows for a more immersive and enjoyable experience.\nThe difficulty is challenging but rewarding, and the various settings extend the games lifespan in a meaningful way. Changin things like base damage is all well and fine, but the addition of more storm vermin to a patrol and other such tweaks really change the way the game plays as you progress in the difficulty settings.\nBefore this game, I had never heard of the developers. But from the road mapping of additional content, to the small details in things like paintings that add a nice touch of immersion, to the way they tackle bugs and treat their customer base with care, I would be more than willing to purchase future games with the same roadmapping.\nOverall, there are many warhammer games out there, but this is definitely a game to pick up for the reasonable $33 (canadian).","October 25, 2015","true","135.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For the longest time, Bad Rats was considered one of the worst games of all time. People would buy it as gifts for their friends as a joke–it became a point of pride to actually not have the game in your library. All this, of course, has been completely outshadowed by the mountains of tripe now available on the storefront thanks to Steam Greenlight, but it’s important to remember the legacy of Bad Rats. It was, however, also among the best rat related games on Steam. Rodent fans really didn’t have much to choose from. That changed in late October, when the Swedish developers Fatshark (War of the Roses, War of the Vikings, Krater) released their most recent game, Warhammer: End Times – Vermintide. Despite having one too many subtitles, Vermintide has stolen my heart as maybe my favourite title when I’m in the mood for co-operative shenanigans.\n\nThe specials are almost straight from Left 4 Dead 2, with a few fresh ones and some alterations to the classics...The main difference from Left 4 Dead 2–I mean, apart from the whole Warhammer thing–is the introduction of different player classes and persistent inventories, giving the game a sort of RPG feel to it when you’ve played it for an extended period of time. At the end of each (successful) mission, you’ll gain experience and get a chance to roll some dice, the number of which depends on your difficulty level and any “loot dice” you’ve picked up as you were killing Skaven. The outcome of the dice roll determines the quality and type of the loot you’re given for completing the mission.\n\nI could sit here and talk about my own experiences with Vermintide for hours–how, after losing three of my party members and sitting on like 2% health I fluked a rescue of our Waywatcher, and the two of us held off the oncoming horde to revive our two downed party members and complete the mission. Oh, or the time that my entire party got wiped out within about 30 seconds of starting the Black Powder mission by a totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t selection of Special Skaven spawns at exactly the same time. At the end of it all, I probably could’ve gotten away with saying what everyone else is saying: Vermintide is an RPG-esque Left 4 Dead successor set in the Warhammer universe with Skaven instead of zombies, and it’s absolutely fantastic–if any of those things tickle your fancy, then you must play it. While it may have rats, and they may be bad, please don’t get it confused with Bad Rats.","May 28","true","18.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There doesent seem to be enough content to justify a 30 dollar title, is it fun? Yes. Is the loot system as screwy as people say? I think its weird, but its fine in my eyes. I got 5 Sword and Averland shields in a row, so I wasent estatic but I like the difficulty of it, it makes it more worthwhile in replayability.\n\nIn regards to replayability I dont think there is any, Tomes seem to be in the same places, no change of route, chests tend to always be in the same location but the loot of whats in it or where is changed. Would I buy this game for the 32.99 price tag? No, its not even remotely worth that, escpecially without mods. On to my next thing.\n\nNo mods, and they arent sure if there will be mods. I love the game but it would be awesome to be able to have even just cosmetic mods, mods for player made maps, weapons, loot. It made L4D worth the price tag today. Without them it makes a game thats very fun for a romp, a month thing.\n\nI hate to say these things as I support these devs, I like how they made the dlc playable if with someone who owns it. The game deserved a positive review, but I can only say its positive for the right price. Its not 32.99, for the full game its (In Canada) 46.28, for the base game, the collectors edition with even more paywal content brings it up higher. You can say the games only 19.79 on sale, but thats not true. A games price is every piece of DLC together, without DLC its not a full game. I would pay 30 for this happily, all in all future dlc. There is no story and the only thing that changes is the people you play with and the weapons you choose.\n\nI will buy this game, Im glad it went on a free weekend because I got to try it and realize I like it. Few annoying bugs in regards to finishing a map on the hardest difficulty and it crashing at the end when I got a grimoire and tomes and loot dice so I lost out on the roll....

And you'd have to play the game pretty well to do it with just the AI, most of the time they're hopelessly useless other than being damage sponges and dying 1/4th of the way through a mission albeit I've only played the game on Hard difficulty, they'll probably live 1/2 way through on Normal.","May 30","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Worth £10, but only if you have a group of people to play with. For me this is merely a ray of light signalling that one day Hellraid may be released, and may actually be good.\n\nMaps are well designed, with some very fun activities to do in each of them. The unlockables add to the replayability, whilst the range of characters caters to all playstyles. Sadly the actual premise of the melee combat tends to lean towards the clunky side, more often than not sending your character into a frantic spinning of hammers and swords to simply kill a small group of rats. They could have added some mount and blade style depth, but instead this is much more of an arcade style coop game to blaze through with some mates.\n\nThe colours in the game are ultimately very bland, though this is obviously intentionally done so to compliment the aesthetic archaic time the game is set in.\n\n\nNot worth full price, but definitely worth a shot if you are in dire need of some melee fun. I also suggest you take a look at the new fps spacehulk game set in the Warhammer universe if you are interested in Vermintide.","May 30","true","1.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There doesent seem to be enough content to justify a 30 dollar title, is it fun? Yes. Is the loot system as screwy as people say? I think its weird, but its fine in my eyes. I got 5 Sword and Averland shields in a row, so I wasent estatic but I like the difficulty of it, it makes it more worthwhile in replayability.\n\nIn regards to replayability I dont think there is any, Tomes seem to be in the same places, no change of route, chests tend to always be in the same location but the loot of whats in it or where is changed. Would I buy this game for the 32.99 price tag? No, its not even remotely worth that, escpecially without mods. On to my next thing.\n\nNo mods, and they arent sure if there will be mods. I love the game but it would be awesome to be able to have even just cosmetic mods, mods for player made maps, weapons, loot. It made L4D worth the price tag today. Without them it makes a game thats very fun for a romp, a month thing.\n\nI hate to say these things as I support these devs, I like how they made the dlc playable if with someone who owns it. The game deserved a positive review, but I can only say its positive for the right price. Its not 32.99, for the full game its (In Canada) 46.28, for the base game, the collectors edition with even more paywal content brings it up higher. You can say the games only 19.79 on sale, but thats not true. A games price is every piece of DLC together, without DLC its not a full game. I would pay 30 for this happily, all in all future dlc.

Nuclear war, giant meteor, zombie apocalypse?\nWell as it turns out, it’s rats! Big, giant, ugly rats… with mini-guns.\nYou and your group of misfits are caught right in the middle of it and the only option is to work together, decapitate rats and do whatever the local pub’s landlord tells you to do.\n\nVermintide is a lot of fun. The combat system is fluid and works well in 1st person. With a hack and slash I personally favour 3rd person mode but is helped by game options that can tweak your field of view. You don’t need to hit the enemy right in the middle of your crosshair, instead it simulates well the force and range of a mighty slash and thrust with your weapon of choice.\n\nThe combat is fast paced and often manic when pushing back hordes (and I do mean hordes) of stinky sewer rats. Team work is key and each character has their unique playstyle and abilities to help and counter certain enemies or situations.\nThere’s no real backstory for the characters at the start of the game (although a google search will find great backstories) but through hilarious and well written and voice acted interactions during the game, you start to see who these people are and how they ended up in the sewer storm that is the city of Ubersreik.\n\nThere is a nice crafting and loot system for you to personalise and upgrade your warriors, including new blades and blunderbuss’ or a new hat with an even bigger feather! Trust me, in the game the big feather makes sense.\n\nThe enemies are also well rounded and varied, from slave rats with daggers, to mini-gun wielding psycho rats and even giant rat ogres! The game system also slightly randomises encounters, so when you replay a level (which you will) don’t expect it to happen the way it did before.\n\nThe game is tough, it’s the end of the world after all and there are no auto saves or checkpoints during missions, meaning if you fail, it’s right back to the start like the good old gaming days of old! The missions themselves aren’t long but you will probably make several attempts before actually completing one. Checkpoints would be a nice addition as you will fail a few times and going back to the beginning does start to create level fatigue. I tend to dip in and out of Vermintide for small gaming sessions with friends, rather than a whole weekend of rat-slaying chaos!\n\nUltimately, this is a multiplayer game with a 4 human/dwarf/elf/wizard/crazy person team. That’s not to say you can’t play on your own, the AI isn’t bad although obviously it’s not as good (or sometimes as bad) as human players. The ability for players to hot join games is great, optional feature.\n\nAlthough I’ve played solo, the game really shines when I’m playing with friends. Holding your ground, screams of panic, calling for help and cursing as you run crying from a rat ogre!\n\nIf you want a fun, manic and wonderfully detailed world with great characters to run around in with friends, then Vermintide is for you.\n","May 31","true","14.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That's pretty much all you need to know about it. If you like either of those IPs and/or have friends to play with, this is a lot of fun. If you don't like either of those and have no one to play with, this probably isn't the game for you. The game has already led to many memorable and frenetic moments for my friends and me. It was obviously meant to be played cooperatively, so if you plan on playing alone you'd be missing out on a lot of what it has to offer.\n\nA lot of common complaints I saw in other reviews I can't really comment on or don't agree with because:\n\n- bad matchmaking (I have people I play with, and any empty slots get filled pretty regularly)\n- bugs (a few, but none that were game breaking. Who knows, that could change)\n- repetitive (maybe, but it would be repetitive in the way L4D or any other hack-n-slash is repetitive)\n- grindy for items (Not really. Right off the bat you have way, way more diversity in potential gameplay styles through the classes, and after 7 hrs I've already gathered a bunch of functionally different weapons for each class. If you feel compelled to own all things immediately, then yes, I can see how this might seem grindy.)\n\nTo be fair I got this on sale for $18, you'll have to decide for yourself how much a co-op slash-em-up L4D is worth to you. With that in mind I'm happy with my purchase, and look forward to many nights shouting profanities at virtual rat-men as I cave in their heads with a giant hammer.","May 30","true","17.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I had the pleasure of bumping into one of your powers-that-be (THE power..?) and age ago.\n\nJust wanted to say - good job! You've successfully critically analysed the mechanics from a game that's delieverd an entertaining play experience (L4D) and improved upon it. Love it!\n\nTo you folks out there in gaming land, this is what you want - smart developers that refine and improve, providing you with ever better gaming experiences. It's like SCIENCE!\n\nSo, what do we have? Left 4 Dead, framed with a Warhammer context, and then some.\n\nWhat's been added?\n\n- gambling/unlock system, itemisation and customisation. In the good way, as oppossed to the ever popular 'milk your fanbase's playtime by hiding the goodies behind a time wall'. The core experience is delievered from the start, the rest is simply tinkering things to suit your playstyle.\n\n- focus on melee. Blocking is an important part of play. Not everyone needs to get up close and personal and a shield isn't required to succeed, but oh yes does it help. If you were the type to pick up the fireaxe in L4D, damn everything else, and boldy take point, slaughtering all the deadheads that dared oppossed you, then you're gonna love this game.\n\n- better signalling. You can tag specials for your team mates, helping you cooridinate your efforts. Likewise, the sound effects triggered before a special enemy attacks are clear and add to the atmosphere.\n\n- which brings me to the specials. We've basically got the smoker (pack master), hunter (assassin), spitter (poisonwind globadier.. with less floor-splash, more in-your-face gas distortion and the tendency to self destruct on death), and tanks (rat ogres). Thankfully there's no jockey but we do get the awesome Storm Vermin, who have a habit of clumping up and giving you grief, thanks to their armour.\n\n- Warhammer. Grimdark. Dirt. Rats. Cracks. Stains. It's all there. If you've ever wanted to virtually sniff the docks of an Imperial city, or stain your boots in its fetid sewers, or perhaps simply chill in a gloomy tavern with a very ugly bar tenders, then this is the game for you.\n\nWhat are we missing?\n\n- Sadly, we can't play as the Skaven.\n\n- There's a crippling shortage of rednecks.\n\n- The colour palette seems washed out, though I figure this is more to do with the confusing Gamma settings instructions. Personally, I wacked things down till they were gloomy and never could find the second symbol...\n\n\nTL:DR\n\n4 players. Ideally friends. Fighting hordes of ratmen. With axes, swords, fire, guns and bow. In a lavish gothic-fantasy setting.\n\nGood fun.

A must have for anyone. This redefines the co-op genre and will be looked back upon as the gold standard of co-op experiance. It takes obvious ques from games like LFD/LFD2 and Killing Floor yet towers above both as the genre defining example. The melee combat is superb (much like Skyrim but much more polished and meaty). The graphic fidelty is something to behold and they nail the gritty unforgiving Warhammer fantasy setting. The difficulty is set high even on normal but the introduction of loot drops and random dynamic enemy/chest spawns makes every game feel fresh and new.

After 10hrs, I cannot recommend this game enough. If you like Warhammer at all, or if you had some fun with L4D, get Vermintide. Hell, even if you didn't, and just like co-op games, get it. Just get it. It's amazing. Granted, there are bugs, and issues, but no game is without its share of those, especially in the first year its released.\n\nContent at this point looks very polished, playing through the same levels again and again does not get old, simply due to the fact that the maps are fairly lengthy, and every time you play it, things are different. Not only do spawns change, but the things that you end up fighting can change too.\nMelee combat feels quite natural, takes minimal effort to get used to. Ranged combat is a little more challenging but very rewarding. Survival relies more on positioning and quick thinking, as well as staying together and working as a team, which is paramount to victory.\nThe loot system keeps me coming back for more, and gives me incentive to continue playing. Others might not like it, I'm sure, but the best weapons in the game aren't *that* much better than some of the weapons I own only 10hrs in, which aren't *that* much better than the tier below it, and so on.\nAnd then there's the characters. Each one has so many lines of dialogue that relate to very specific scenarios, or even subtle interactions with other characters. Each voice actor is perfect for their character.\n\nTL;DR - Muy bueno. 10/10 best pest control simulator or some other crappy joke who cares the game's great and I honestly think it's the best game of 2015. Yes, better than Fallout 4. Come at me.","December 10, 2015","true","63.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

When we play, I host and open to public. It fills pretty fast and it is rare we are playing with bots. We did not encounter any rude people or griefer.

And while it has some issues, I would recommend you get it during sale.\n\nPros:\n- While it is clearly modeled after L4D, it does give it a fresh new set of paint, and doesn't seem all that similar.\n- The characters are well designed, voice acting is great and enemies' overall design looks pretty stellar\n- The hack and slash first person nature complements the setting very well.\n- Very atmospheric, levels are quite long and thought out.\n- Has an interactive customization of loadouts and forging system, which help give the player an identity.\n- Difficulty setting which restricts players from playing above hard, forcing them to prove their skill to play.\n- Has bots capability and host migration now, replacing the annoying Peer-to-peer system where all players are kicked if the host leaves.\n- Has a captivating story instead of L4D's generic "zombie invasion" plot.\n- Requires Co-operative gameplay to work, punishing stragglers and loners.\n\nCons\n\n- Enemies are hard to destinguish from players due to the lack of borders around them constantly, also the general dingyness of it makes it difficult too\n- Ranged weapons are underpowered and have limited ammunition, making the Mage much easier to play as, since her ammo is unlimited and splash damage fire is generally more reliable.\n- Optimization issues.\n- Crafting system is quite haphazard and awkward to work with.\n- Inventory items are only collected after beating a mission, making grinding inevitable.\n- As with many games, connectivity issues are amok and you'll lag like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if your ping sucks.\n- No workshop or mods.\n- Bots are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n- Some of the objectives are dauntingly repetitive, and hauling slow objects while you're defensless, relying on your teammates to help you really sucks if you're playing with non-cooperative teammates.\n- Incredibily slidy movement, combat can sometimes be clunky.\n- No voice radial option, making communication purely text based.\n- Not much indication in terms of audio or visual cues as to when your teammates are in peril or an enemy is close.\n- The game doesn't seem to aid you at all in terms of finding weapons. You'll constantly find medical equipment during the start while your health is optimum, but there's a 50/50 chance it'll stop all together during the finale of the chapter.\n\n\nOnce again, good idea to get this while it's on sale.

Personally I think this is very well executed. Everything from level design, narration, voice acting, and to model design are all really really good. My only complaint right from the 1 match I got to play is the AI still need a bit of work, as well as network optimizations. But I could see myself playing this a lot if I wis rich enough for a L4D clone... Everyone who has played L4D has likely play the sh-t out of it and probably doesn't want anything else to do with it. Why buy a more expensive reskin of a game when you already own the game this is copying anyways? This I think may be the reason the game is struggling to survive. Unfortunately, the player base reflects that...\n\nSince the launch of the game up until the free weekend. the player count has dropped about 89% according to Steam Charts, and continues to dwindle down each month. After this free weekend, there's been about a 12% increase in average players. That's not good at all. In a few months time the player base will average at a few hundred and by the end of the year probably stick to around 300+ people. This game doesn't deserve that kind of demise. I really hope it bounces back somehow because I can tell a lot of work was put into this. Maybe permanently slash the price by half?

A group of four characters, chosen from five, will fight together to go through quests and accomplish feats.\n\nThe pros:\n-Intrigiuing loot system which rewards you for finding hidden Tomes and Loot Dice.\n-Crafting system is interesting, and allows buildup towards exotic weapons the longer the playthrough.\n-No microtransactions that make it a 'pay-to-win'. Simply gameplay driven.\n-Combat is strong, fast-paced, and requires your individed attention, lest a pack-rat or assassin rat make your life a living hell.\n-Enemy AI makes combat fun an interesting.\n-An alright diversity of enemies makes combat thrilling.\n\nThe cons:\n-Nowhere near enough different kinds of weapons.\n-A lot of the classes, due to a limitted amount of weapons, feel very restricted in their build pattern. For example, the waywatcher only really ever has a bow for ranged.\n-The friendly AI suck miserably. Very miserably. They're just ♥♥♥♥. Always, always play with friends instead. Numerous times, the farther into missions you go, the AI will just sit there and do absolutely nothing. Sometimes they'll just wait in one spot while you progress through the map, and do LITERALLY nothing. Their combat skills are god-awful, often never taking advantage of DPS or anything, and just hold the block button. They get stuck in walls like it's nobody's business, and have no concept of navigation.\n-Even in full release, almost all of the bugs from pre-release stayed. For example, many players experience vertice glitches, where one or two vertices of characters will be in the floor, whereas the rest of the body will be either above it, or elsewhere if they've been ragdolled. Also, character models sometimes just have disappearing bodyparts.\n\nConclusion: All in all, I still love the game. The problems are counteracted by the thrilling combat and intriguing crafting system, which puts a lot of other games to shame. Even still, though, I'd highly recommend playing with friends. The friendly AI are more cancer than I can describe. They just don't function.","October 24, 2015","true","27.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dankdav/recommended/235540/","dankdav","Buddha Fett","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dankdav/","335 products in account","I cannot reccomend a game with a cancerous community. But I do reccomend a good game. This is a good game, not a good community.\nWith a HEAVY (and I mean 3.5 metric♥♥♥♥tons) focus on teamplay and cooperation. This game is golden for friends and players who ENJOY working together. Unlike most of the playerbase who rather exploit and try to solo this game to get loot. (They have fixed an exploit and over a week 50% of the playerbase droppped. Shows something) But instead of a long rant about this game heres a simple list of pros and cons since you prefer those better\n\nPros:\n+(Personal Pro) Warhammer universe shown all in its glorious splender. Not a colorful bloody world but, dark dingy and +dank, with some colorful missions.\n+Some well done (but still needs tweaking) melee combat (This is a melee focused game, Guns are more situational than a main weapon even for the Elf and her bow)\n+Great atmosphere, Characters talk and bicker with one another, get to see some cool city scapes\n+Enemies, most enemies vary and show off a distinct look like the Gutter Runner (Akin to L4D Hunter), Ogre (tank) +Packmaster, (Smoker/jockey), Poison Thrower (Spitter/smoker), and Ratling Gunner. And each one is equally deadly\n+Lobby, now this was interesting to me but could still use more work. You start off inside a safehouse/inn working with other players to survive the Vermintide, more or so an interactive UI where you can choose your mission, customize and upgrade weapons.\n\nCons\n-Toxic community, most of the games you will join it will be silent no one wants to chat with one another. From time to time you get a "GG", or "Halp me!" but apart from those no one likes to talk. People seem to be reluctant to help you and more inclined to insult you for going down. In fact the player base dropped from 25k to 11k after the devs fixed an exploit on a certain mission.\n-Lootbags, idk what to call these players but this ties into the con above. The reason why players left was because the said fixed exploit gave players loot, whether it be good or bad.\n-Difficulty, personally I like the difficulty. Hard is MEANT to be hard, Nightmare is well. A NIGHTMARE. Starting off at level 1-2 then trying to play on nightmare you are gonna have a bad time. The range of the Skaven are ridiculously long in melee, and most newbies dont know that you CAN dodge in this game. (hold down ASD and space and you will slide left right or back) But with a heavy focus on teamwork and noone working as a team. Players will have a bad time.\n-Bugs there are still many bugs that were said to have been "fixed" Like when the orge attacks a downed player. That still happens or when the pack master grabbing someone from 2 stories up or through the floor.\n\n\nOverall I CAN say this is a good game. But I cant reccomend it for people who play solo or matchmaking.\nThe community is iffy. The gameplay is good but not solid. Hopefully within the coming months we might get some new content.\n\n","October 31, 2015","false","38.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","1"

However, the limited amount of content, repetetive gameplay, heavy reliance on randomness to drive (slow)progression, and unforgiving game play may be (very)off putting to some.\n\n\n\n===PROS/CONS/CONCLUSION===\n\n\n==PROS==\n\n+L4D CooP alike in many ways\n\n+There are five different characters, with 3 that play differently and 2 that play similiarly to each other.\n\n+Itemization with Progression (mostly through items)\n\n+Well realized grim-dark Warhammer atmosphere\n\n+Well done weapons and animiations give the combat a visceral appeal.   The visceral combat where you slay hordes of Skaven can be especially apealing.\n\n\n==CONS==\n\n-It is very easy to fail & a failure nets next to nothing as far as progression goes (no loot,  very low experience)\n\n-A failed missions resets you to the very start of long missions.  There are no safe houses as restart points like l4d2.\n\n-If the host crashes/disconnects mid-mission, you lose all progress.  No dedicated servers (yet).\n\n-Rewards are completely random.  The RNG for loot after a mission often results in a very poor reward or rewards for toons you aren't interested in playing.\n\n-You can't trade items with other players.   Items can't be chosen using in game currency.\n\n-Only one game mode, albiet with several difficulty levels i.e.,No survival mode or versus mode\n\n-Repetetive gameplay/limited content: You can play through all the levels at least once in a dozen or so hours of play.  Most people play the same 2 or 3 levels over and over again.   What fun(not!).\n\n-Due to many of the above CONs, this game has the worst PUG experience I have experienced in any game, ever.  This game isn't like killing floor 1/2 where random matches will be fun and provide progression most of the time.\n\n-Poor bot AI.  Don't think you can play this solo to get around the PUG problem.\n\n-No steam integration to see who you recently played with.  If you get DC'ed before the end, have fun trying to find the game you were just in.\n\n\n==Conclusion==\nIn the end, while the game is compared to l4d, it isn't anywhere as near as fun to play\n\nThis is one of the most compelling games I have played recently, but the game experience is often totally wrecked by the CONS.  I also suspect the CONS will kill the community in relatively short order.\n\nI uninstalled this to make sure I was never tempted to play it again.  Too bad, this was almost a great game.","October 30, 2015","false","44.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","8","14","2","1"

With all the issues I would still rate it about 8/10 as of now - and there are promisses of further development.\n\nWhat is worth mentioning - the game is P2P, meaning NO DEDICATED SERVERS. This CAN be an issue. Games WILL be broken because of that. And if you live in a more secluded place (say, Poland, or even more exotic) you may find it difficult to find players if it is YOU who are hosting, since players will auto-connect to the nearest location, not best ping or connection quality.\nIf you know there will be few people playing the game in your country, I would seriously suggest removing a point or two from the score. At least I FELT like that.","October 26, 2015","true","22.5"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","0"

"Nah, screw that. Let's just go blow the horn of Magnus once more."\nWarhammer: End Times - Vermintide is a bland copy of L4D franchise but set in the Warhammer Fantasy Universe. You take control of one of the 5 heroes and form a group of 4 with your friends or bots(I assume the unpicked hero is preparing the sandwiches or something in the inn).  While the game takes a lot of l4d elements it also add some on its own .. for bad or good. So the review will more of comparing stuff between Vermintide and L4D.\n\nWhat the game takes from L4D\nGameplay\n\nAll in all, Vermintide follows L4D gameplay - fight your way through hordes of Skavens(that use the same tactic as zombies aka swarm you) with 3 of your buddies. Every now and then you will hear a horn and get attacked by a horde(hearing your characters saying "Its a trap/ambush"). I cant denied that those moments can be a lot of fun until ...\n\nSpecial skaven\n\nSpecial Skavens are either 1:1 with their l4d brothers or a mix.\nGutter Runner is the hunter but its way more agile and fast + can use smoke bombs to run away quickly.\nRat Ogre is the tank with no change in its behaviour(apart from passing through solid objects like pillars or wells).\nPoison Wind Globadier is Spitter but with much bigger AoE and while it do less damage, it can disrupt your vision for awhile. It also will run towards you and explode just like Bomber.\nPackmaster(the most broken one) act like Jockey but instead of leaping on you, it hooks you with his poll and drags you away from your teammate not caring about collission or pathfinding(it can teleport if he gets "blocked") .\nCommander/Stormvermin are just stronger skavens using long halbered to fight from behind the meat shield and also being equiped with heavy armor that makes them hard to kill.\nRatlling Gunner reminds me a bit of the Smoker but instead of having a long tongue that grabs you(like packmaster) it has a gattling gun that charges up before it turns you into Swiss cheese if you arent behind cover. Not that it matters because is some scenarios his bullets passes through solid walls like nothing.\n\nUI and slots\n\nVermintide uses the same UI as l4d which includes and what where is mapped on your keyboard with the little difference that melee weapons are in slot 1 and ranged in slot 2(in l4d melee is secondary weapon) . Then you have your healing items in slot 3. After it you have switched again slots for bombs and potions: number 4 is for potions, number 5 for bombs(other way around in l4d). So for veteran l4d players it wont need much time to get used to it.\n\nChanged L4D elements with a drop of Vermintide\nConsumables\n\nL4D2 consumables are medkit/defibrilator, grenades(pipe,bile and molotov) and pills/adrenaline.\nVermintide offer some different consumables with some that are import for if you want higher chance to get more rare loot(that doesnt mean it will be better).\nFor healing you have healing potion and medical supplies. While both heals you the same, you can use the potion only on yourself(you cant give it to somebody else) and medical supplies can be used on anybody.\nFor bombs you have exploding and incendiary. First makes BOOM, the 2nd just set rats on fire.\nFor potions you have speed and strength: speed increases your attack and move speed while strength gives your attack armor piercing .\nNow there are 2 special "consumables" that increases the chance to get rare loot: Tomes(take the place of your healing item) and Cursed Grimoire(takes the place of your potion and lowers the max health of your party by 25% unless "discarded" ) .But more about them later\n\nLevels\n\nThe story of Vermintide is spread on 13 levels. You will encounter 2 kind of levels : Linear and "horde" mode.\nLinears are going from point A to point B while "horde" mode will give you the task to either gather X amount of barrels/sacks or just need to defend objective while you are getting swarmed.\nFor me personally the horde mode missions were boring but thats because I overplayed the mode itself in other games.\nLinear on the other hand has its charm. Levels are completly linear. They often have small pockets to explore for supplies or tomes. There are also a lot of chests to open but dont get your hopes up(unless RNGesus is with you). Only around 1/4 of the chests I opened had something in them.\n\nCharacters\n\nVermintide features 5 playable characters with their unique personality and "unique" combat skills. You will often hear them exchange lines between each other while playing but whats interesting is their fighting style.\nDwarf Ranger and Empire Soldier feels the same. They both can wield heavy 2hand weapons and can use 1hand weapon with shield which makes them the frontline of the party. Add to that their ranged weapons have slow reload and you will end up shooting only special skavens while sticking to your melee.\nWitch Hunter and Waywatcher are more of a fast and agile. They excel in ranged combat because of their fast reload time. But that doesnt mean they are bad in melee combat... they just arent as good as the soldier or the dwarf.\nLast but not least is the Bright Wizard who is the only one who actually feels unique duo to her using magic and vent mechanic. While you cast spells your overcharge bar will feel. Bar got 2 levels(lvl1 and lvl2). Below level 1, the staff vents itself automaticly so if you time your attack you may end up rarely passing level1. Upon passing level 1 you will either need to switch to melee weapon while waiting for the staff to cooldown, or can vent it yourself by hurting yourself. At level2(max charge) you will  lose control of your character until it vent itself.\n\nFresh from the source\nProgression\n\nWhen you finish a mission(or fail) you will gain experience that will level up your character. When you level up you will obtrain .... an item(white from lvl1-30, green from lvl30 and above)!!! But on level15 and 30 you will unlock a new trinket slot for your characters. Level is shared between your characters but its not like it matters much anyway. A high level player doesnt mean that he is a good one.\n\nEquipment\n\nTo add some sort of RPG system, Vermintide got to offer 4 kinds of equipment(hat,melee weapon,ranged weapon,trinkets) and 4 rarities(plentiful,common,rare,exotic) . And depending on the rarity your item will have 0,1,2,3 traits(bonuses) that you need to unlock.\n\nCombat\n\nL4D is a shooter with optional melee combat. Well Vermintide is on the other end. Its hack'n slash combat with shooting every now and then. Melee weapons got basic and charged attack + you can block attack or push away your foe to open some space. Simple yet effective and fun.\n\n\nSo far everything sounds good and fun,right?\n\nMy personal issues\nI have 2 big problems with the game that just turns the game from fun to frustrating experience that aint worth it.\n\nSpawn points\n\nI'm just getting sick of encountering 4 or 5 special skavens at the same time, especially with the broken packmaster. often they will spawn where the common skaven spawns and if you are close enough to the spot you are gonna get hooked in a blink of an eye. Add to this the 4-5 times when a rattling gunnar spawned outside of the map and was shooting us through the wall. But I guess the icing of the cake was facing 2 groups of  3 gutter runners each  in the first 2 mins of starting the map.\nNow if Fatshark can manage to pull it off and create something similar to l4d's AI director that would be cool.\n\nLoot system\n\nContinues in the comments.","November 3, 2015","false","77.0"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","16","30","3","1"

It has a melee weapon focus, loot drops, character customization, and long-form maps. Unfortunately it suffers from a whole suite of problems ranging from terrible balance issues, a wholly unrewarding loot system, and complete lack of optimization.\n\nStarting out on normal the game seems decent enough, killing rats feels nice, you haven't had to deal with the drop system yet, and you aren't familiar with all of the special rats. After several hours however you will start to realize the truth, there's no skill to be had in dealing with any of the special rats unlike the Left 4 Dead series making many of the encounters with them just free damage upon you and/or your party, the drop system isn't rewarding in the slightest and in many cases is downright insulting, and balance issues abound making even clearing basic maps on medium difficulties with a full team of random people nigh impossible.\nUnfortunately by the time you realize this game is a massive disappointment, you'll be outside of the range of receiving a refund from steam. Don't be like me, kids.\n\n[My full review of this game was going to be around 1500 words and 9000 characters, but it doesn't fit on the reviews here - that's How many flaws this game has and how disappointed I was.]","November 1, 2015","false","28.3"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","19","36","0","0"

A four-player co-op horde survival game a la Payday, Killing Floor, L4D set in Warhammer universe with Chivalry-style combat initially had me quite intrigued.\n\nHowever, the game still plays like it did when it was in beta. It suffers performance issues which in some cases are nearly crippling. Combat with multiple opponents almost always results in quite bad FPS issues. Enemy weapon reach is far longer than the weapons the enemies are holding.\nAn especially frustrating issue I have encountered is that the player takes damage from an enemy attack as soon as the enemy's attack animation begins, meaning you've got to have some Jedi-level perception in order to block successfully.\n\nMost of these issues have been present since the beta began, yet the developers seem far more interested in patching 'exploits' in the levels than fixing performance problems. This is a practice that was seen in several Payday 2 DLC releases and it earned many grievances against Overkill from their playerbase.\n\nThis title still has potential, if the issues with it are addressed. When the game runs well, it's pretty fun. It's gory and full of decapitations and blood, which is always a hit with the crowd. But I would advise holding off on the purchase, either until the game is fixed or there's a decent discount on it.","October 31, 2015","false","25.2"," 21 of 40 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","21","40","0","3"

I get about 120 fps on average, but the second a horde of skaven spawn I dip down to around 30-40 fps until the fight is over. I was dumb enough to play the pre-order beta, and was hoping for some drivers / optimization patches from Fatshark, but nothing yet. I have a GTX 970 FTW+, i7 960 processor, 12gb of ram, and the game is installed on my SSD. I can run Witcher 3, GTA 5, and other newer titles on ultra and get around 80-90 FPS no problem. There is no reason why this game should be using 80% of my GPU and 100% of my CPU while im sitting in the inn (pre-game lobby, very small, almost nothing going on). There is obviously some serious CPU optimization issues with this title, and I would strongly suggest not picking it up until they are hammered out... if they ever are. The other thing I dislike about this game is the loot system. It is way too RNG heavy, and 90% of the time I get some useless item for a class I never plan on playing. If this game ran smoother it might be worth the $22 I paid for it, but it runs like I have a baked potato shoved into my CPU chip slot, and some silly puddy jammed into my PCI slot for a GPU. Melee combat / ranged combat is okay... although chopping through an enemy / enemies isn't as satisfying as it games like Chivalry where you really feel the blow connect to your opponent. Overall the game just feels rushed and not of the greatest quality, I would rate it a 6/10... probably a 7.5/10 if it ran at a solid 60+ FPS without horrid framedrop in combat.","October 29, 2015","false","24.8"," 28 of 54 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","28","54","3","0"

I'm giving it a "Not Recommended" rating but depending on the player it could just as easily be "Recommended". It's just that for me, it isn't worth it. Allow me to explain.\n\nVermintide is a fun game. You'll find yourself fighting through hordes of ratmen with a group of three others in an attempt to complete a set of objectives on each stage. The combat is generally solid with a couple minor complaints I'll talk about later and the stages are challanging. It plays very much like Left4Dead... Perhaps too much. And that is where my main complaint comes in. This really seems like an unashamed clone of Left4Dead with a new coat of paint. However, it does have some things that set it apart. Let's look a little closer, starting with a look at some enemies.\n\nRatling Runner = Hunter\nRuns at you, leaping on top of you and pinning you to the ground while laying into you with it's daggers. Can stealth. Knocks teammates away when it pounces.\n\nRatling Taskmaster = Jockey\nGrabs you with a long staff and pulls you away from your team until someone kills it.\n\nRat Ogre = Tank\nExtremely tough. Charges in lines at your team.\n\nPoison Wind Globadier = Spitter\nThrows poison cloud grenades that force you to avoid camping one spot too long.\n\nAre there any more unique enemies? So far the only ones I can spot is the Gunner and Commander. The gunner is a ratling with a minigun who can pose a bit of a threat if you aren't careful while the commander wears heavy armor that forces you to use heavy attacks or aim for his head.\n\nThe overlay and player death mechanics are also near identical, with the classic green and red outlines for your teammates and the ability to find a downed teammate awaiting rescue further into the stage.\n\nAs for what sets it apart from Left4Dead. There is a huge focus on melee combat here. Some classes, such as the mage utilize ranged combat heavily, however most classes will find themselves chest deep in blood and gore within seconds of starting the fight. There are blocking and dodge mechanics and overall the melee combat feels solid, if a little floaty. I sometimes feel there isn't enough weight behind my blows, though perhaps that's because all the blades seem to cut through ratlings like a hot knife through butter. Combat would feel much more satisfying if there were a little more impact to the blows.\n\nThere is also a fun loot system that has you coming back for more as you try to find that awesome new piece of gear that will help you clear that next highest difficulty. Though you may wait quite a while as loot is heavily RNG based and you can get drops for classes you don't actually play...\n\nOverall it's a fun game though. If you like Left4Dead, you're gonna like Vermintide. Just don't expect any huge innovations here.","October 24, 2015","false","3.7"," 37 of 72 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","37","72","3","0"

However, it mainly focuses on melee weapons as all the ranged weapons are slow to shoot and reload. Also, 'nades are scattered in boxes, you got it, just like Left 4 Dead.\n\nHowever, the feeling of the world, character design and enemies all look unique. While the special "boss" enemies all aren't too original, that's really not the point of this game. It's derivative but it's also a lot of fun. Even with strangers. Lopping heads and arms off ratmen never really gets old.\n\nThe only disappointing part of this game is the lack of maps to go through and the declining community. Perhaps the developer needs to release more DLC more quickly because the loot system is amazing, the world is rich and the characters that you play as are all quite unique.\n\nI highly recommend giving this game a try. Just hope you have some people on your friend's list with it or you may have trouble finding a match unless you play above Normal difficulty.","January 24","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Players are thrown into the game with no idea of how hard it is. Many players will fail their first few games because of this, and it turns them off from the game. The game itself is pretty cool. I really like the setting, and the graphics are good. Missions are REALLY long, usually around 30 minutes for one mission. If you don't play with friends, just hope and pray you find an expierienced player or two, because new players really pull down the team. There is a decent amount of missions, gamemodes, and enemies. Events are generated randomly, so you don't know what will be waiting for you. Loot system is interesting. In order to get good loot at the end of the mission, you have to find in-game items hidden throughout the mission which make the mission  itself harder by reducing total health and taking up the potion slot. They increase the chance of a higher level item. This system is good in theory, but it leads players to play the same mission over and over and over because they know the locations of these hidden items. This gets pretty boring, and if you fail the mission it is very irritating. It's fun for a while. 6/10","January 25","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The crunch of a rat skull under a warhammer will send shivers down your spine.\nAll 5 characters feel unique, and because groups are made up of four, you'll never get stuck without a choice.\nUnrelenting difficult at higher levels unless you work as a team and communicate effectively.\nIt will make you tense up. You will be anxious, wondering when the rat ogre is going to show up.\nRat Ogres.\nWhen you win, you'll feel like you've earned it.\nGear doesn't make the player. Skill does.\nNo pay to win at all.\nFree DLC.\nCons\nNot all weapons are made equal. While they can all be fun, only some are viable on harder difficulties.\nCommunicating with a public group can be brutal. Better hope they all know what they're doing on the highest difficulties.\nTutorial? We don't need no stinkin' tutorial.\nNo dedicated servers, if a host drops you restart the level. Bad lag can end a good run.\nThe loot system isn't generous, and you will be underwhelmed at times.\nThe rats have gatling guns.\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed L4D, or is interested in a co-op game that will have you at the edge of your seat cheering (or cursing) your friends as you wade through a sea of bipedal rodents with medieval weaponry against all odds.","January 19","true","20.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay itself is similar, but it has a progressive loot system, leveling, and 5 playable heroes over 13 maps.\n\nIt has some things going for it:\n-Fun heroes\n-Various gear to play with\n-Plenty of versatile missions for it's price tag\n-A fairly nice and detailed dark gothic enviroment set deep in warhammer lore\n-Lots of rats and types of rats to slay\n-Incredibly well voiced dialogue\n-Sarcastic ***** of an Elf for you to hate\n\nAlso three real problems that seem to have been noticed by most folks\n-Performance issues, that seem to be steadily improving each update, but there is still some FPS loss on even high end machines on lower settings.\n-The loot system is basically flat out frustrating and most people are not enjoying it. (You need to roll at the end of a successful mission and even if you are lucky and get something half decent, you have to melt down other gear to unlock one of that weapons base bonuses, and it rolls for how much of a bonus again, via RNG. The entire system is RNG based, but in a way that mission rewards do not feel like rewards)\n-A lot of hitbox and clipping issues. Any time a problem comes up that causes an exploit where heroes can beat a mission earier or such is fixed within days, but issues like the Rats that can hit well beyond their actual reach, grab you through walls and pull you through them, teleport around, etc etc... don't seem to be getting much attention\n\nThat being said, the game is throughly enjoyable regardless, especially with a group of friends. I highly suggest taking a look, more so if you enjoyed Left 4 Dead or melee based FPS games.\n\nEdit: There does not seem to be any content coming for this game fast; and that is really what a game like this needs to stay relevent.","November 6, 2015","true","58.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mettil/recommended/235540/","mettil","Mettil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mettil/","340 products in account","Incredibly similar to L4D with a focus on melee combat.  Overall a fun game but not without issues.\n\nPerformance is good overall though I wish the game would give you control over the post processing effects so people with sub-recommended specs could eek out more frames.  The game is CPU heavy.  I have a FX-8320 that I've overclocked to 4.0Ghz.  This is below the recommended CPU for AMD and I experience frame drops down to 30-40fps in heavy fighting and scenic open areas of maps.  My CPU temp approaches 58C and my mobo approaches 65C.  A little high, but doable.  If you have a comparable or lower end CPU be prepared to sacrifice visual fidelity for stable framerates.  I hope this improves after beta or we at least get more control over the graphics settings come launch.\n\nWith the exception of the gatling gun rat, the special enemies are carbon copies of L4D special zombies.  Managing supplies throughout the level works exactly the same as in L4D as well.  The developers played it very safe.  You have your main melee weapon, a secondary ranged weapon, a slot for a medical item, a slot for a buff item (extra speed/melee damage), and a slot for a bomb.  Sound familiar?  With Warhammer being such a diverse property, I'm disappointed the developers didn't try something new with special enemies or items.\n\nAs you play each level you find tomes.  Tomes are slotted in your inventory over medical items.  Having a tome in your inventory at the end of a level gives you a bonus die for the loot system at the end of each round.  You can also find bonus die on special Skaven.  At the end of each round, you roll dice to determine the quality of your loot reward.  The more die roll a glyph or rune or whatever it is, the better quality item you get.  Total RNG with no care given to what class you're playing at the time.  You could be playing a dwarf and unlock gear for the wizard.  This means you can swap heroes easily to try out new gear, but it also makes finding gear for a specific character you prefer a slog.  Gear can be upgraded to unlock special passive bonuses using material gained from salvaging items.  Alternatively, 5 items of the same quality can be upgraded to a random item of the next rarity level.\n\nCo-op vs AI is the only game mode.  As far as I know, there are no plans for a competitive mode where players also control special Skaven.  At $30, I think it's a fair price for the amount of content promised and replayability via the loot system.  If you were expecting this game to be something more than L4D, you might be disappointed.\n\nEdit:  Skaven have oddly long attack range for melee.  Melee attacks from even basic Skaven can hit you through objects and through other Skaven.  In choke points, you'll often be hit by melee attacks you never see because many of the models mush together.  All characters dodge the same distance and it's often useless unless timed perfectly since enemies will track you when telegraphing their attack.","October 18, 2015","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

These are fair in that the engine is basically the same. The highlighted items, characters, and pick-up are all very L4D-y. The immobilizing special enemies that you need your team to rescue you from are also there (and still as annoying). Oh, and the companion AI is still garbage. That being said, however, this does feel like a different enough game.\n\nThe graphics are really good considering the engine age. The mix of each character having a melee and a ranged is great an the characters seem unique enough from eachother but very well blanaced. The combat carries weight and is satisfying.\n\nI held off for a while getting this game because I was conserned there wouldn't be enough persistant character development to really hold my interest but there is. There are a lot of weapon types and qualities to earn that make a huge difference in play style and effectiveness.\n\nDue to not openeing at a ridiculous $60 price tag but instead being a very reasonable price, this is a recommend.","November 15, 2015","true","38.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game can be seen as heavily influenced by Valve's Left 4 Dead games, as the players have two weapon slots, one melee, and one ranged, along side one utility item, one, grenade item, and one healing item, totalling out to five carriable items.\n\nWarhammer: End Times - Vermintide would be identical to the Left 4 Dead series, but there is loot and progression in this one. At the end of each mission, if successful, the players may roll for loot, using die, and having a chance at white, green, and blue rarity items; with white being the lowest and blue being the highest. Unlike Left 4 Dead, the player also has a level to keep up with, like a normal account level.

Graphics look very pretty, weapons feel very nice as well as movement as well as killing the skaven. Now my main beefs are very large. The game is very poorly optimized, even on a 4790k and GTX980 the game stutters badly even on high. As well as this, the game also has very poor netcoding, as well as launcher errors for many people. Still, i guess it is one of those ''B-B-B-BUT it's a beta!'' moments so i guess i'll let these issue slide for now.

I don't have friends to play with, i have a decent pc but not high end and i live in ♥♥♥♥ing south america where very few people play it...

It's so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun (for me of course), i thought because of negative reviews saying that it gets boring because of few mission vartiation but personally i think there's a lot of maps already(and each mission is 30 to 50 min) and they will keep launching more(i hope), it's a pretty new game and it's different difficulties (which for me are very good designed) make it very replayable. Also i saw like a ♥♥♥♥ ton of reviews complaining about the loot drops, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you want to play with only 1 character because of it's randomnes but if you're like me and like to variate the playstyle using different characters it's ok.

I like the game but it is pretty difficult to finish on higher difficulty without a coordinated team, which means basically stick together and hit everything in sight. There does not seem to be a lot of sophisticated tactics involved in the game or the environment at the moment. Occasionally you will use a bow or gun to snipe a difficult mob from a distance but the A.I. for the most part just focuses on constant zerg as it's main tactic. Graphics are nice and mindless combat can be fun but hopefully there is more planned in the future and the weapon upgrades become a little more dynamic. Right now I would give is a 3/5 with potential to increase moving forward.\n\nOne more thing every time a major Skaven rush occurs it seems the only objective is to find the rearest wall, put your back to it and swing your sword at the onslaught until the vermin are all dead. It can be fun and intense in a viseral way, but lacks depth and sophistication.","October 19, 2015","true","21.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It totally is 100% like left 4 dead. You have special classes that represent left 4 dead special infected. The game is really fun with friends but with randoms it is meh. I will go down a list to show the variants and how left 4 dead is similar in the parenthesis since vermintide is the main topic here.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-Gutter Runner (Hunter)\n-Globe Lobber(kinda like the Boomer only thing is that this one deals damage over time without the mobs)\n-Skaven Ogre(Tank)\n-Packmaster (Smoker)\n-Ratling Gunner (I would compare this to a witch only thing different is that the agro is instant when spotted)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The game also has a levelling system in it that will give you items that you get after a certain level. There are also slots that open in customizing your character that will eventually open up items for you to use. For instance, you are a level 4 or below and there is a trinket slot that opens at level 5. (this is just an example, I don’t remember if that trinket slot is open in any certain level… more than likely not) you go to the end of a campaign and you roll for your loot (we’ll get back with that later) and you don’t see any trinkets that drop along the bar. But you have just levelled up to five and you get to roll and there is a trinket that is now droppable in the rolling sequence. If you have the slot open for a specific item, there is a fair chance that you would be able to get the loot drop for that slot when you have it unlocked for that level. Simpler terms, you get what you can use and you don’t get what you can’t even equip yet.\n\nNow, about this rolling, every single time you finish a mission successfully you get to make rolls. In each mission depending on which one it is, you get to come across these items that can help boost up your roll.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-Tomes  (+100 xp and adds one die with more successful sides when rolled)\n-Loot die (basic loot die that adds ontop of your normal 6 die pool)\n-Grimoire (reducing the party health by 33% and is consumable. Once consumed it will make the waves harder and you wont get the guaranteed roll on the guaranteed one die you get if you don’t consume it.)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Certain characters have certain traits about them that follow with the Warhammer age of sigmar realm or time. The elf is snarky towards the dwarf, the witch hunter is no fan of anyone but the soldier, the soldier is the all around whatever human that just chops ♥♥♥♥, the dwarf is not a fan of the magic that the wizard can conjure, and it is just overall an odd alliance.\n\nNow for you people wondering if there will be DLC’s coming out. I honestly don’t know but once you finish the only acts that are available, which hits at the maximum of four, there is an ending cutscene that certainly leaves and opening for other DLC content and I for one am excited for it.\n\nThis game is the first game of Warhammer that I have ever owned. I knew about it and played a lot of D&D and I enjoyed the lore. After playing this, I most definitely want to move over to the lore in Warhammer Age of Sigmar. If you enjoy good ol swordplay with specific roles and classes and love the left 4 dead playstyle… get this game… I highly recommend it. I wouldn’t say that this game is the best co op game cause I will say that Payday 2 is more up on my scale but this game is really fun. Out of 5 stars I would give this game a 4/5.\n","October 29, 2015","true","48.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Real good.\n\n\nThe somewhat longer version goes like this; the game stays very true to the Left 4 Dead formula in which it's based on.  You stay with your team or you die horribly.  Melee combat is visceral and enjoyable and the ranged options range from functional to downright explosive.  Gear allows some variation in play-style, though at the end of the day it's still "kill mouseman, move on to the next."  And that's not a bad thing; Skaven are a lot more enjoyable to kill than brainless zombies.\n\nWhat truly sets this game apart is the 'love' that was put into it; this is not just Games Workshop getting some money for use of their IP, this is a game  that was obviously created by people who know and enjoy the Warhammer Fantasy universe.  The Skaven are appropriately ratty, and the player characters are brilliantly vocalized, delivering lines exactly as a diehard Warhammer fan would expect to hear.","October 20, 2015","true","323.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Recommended for those fans of first-person-co-op games that enjoy playing with others, but less so for those people who aren't prone to play online.\n\nPros:\n* Controls are smooth and (mostly) intuitive\n* Graphics are very good-looking and a wide variety of settings are available\n* Audio is excellent -- when you hit a rat, it sounds exceedingly satisfying\n* Gameplay is good, but the RNG really hits hard when you start getting to the highest difficulty (cataclysm) if you're not prepared\n* Story is well fleshed-out, brief enough to keep your attention and brush the top of the End Times lore\n* Developers are very invested in their job, and frequently listen to players' input and comments\n\nCons:\n* Still a little buggy in places, but much better than release\n* AI improvements to rats make the game harder, but the AI for the bots still needs some tweaking\n* Client-side hosting (P2P)!  Rat damage is calculated on the host's end, but the damage you do to rats is calculated on your end, working well for right now but making for awkward situations when one person (the host) has sub-optimal internet\n\nI would heartily recommend this game to any of my friends, and I applaud Fat Shark (the Devs) for making such an awesome game.

Mechanically, the game is very similar to Left 4 Dead, but with a stronger emphasis on melee combat. There are a limited number of levels, but they are all extremely detailed and as fun to play for a tenth or twentieth time as for a second or third. The loot system also adds to replayability, not because you ever have to grind for loot in order to progress, but because it provides customization and a fun reward for completing harder missions. The difficulty is also well balanced, with the book pick-ups enabling players to make things harder for themselves during a mission in order to get better rewards. Also, while set in the Warhammer universe, this is certainly not just for fans of the franchise. The rats are an appealing enemy for just about anyone, with approachably flavorful animation and voice lines. The player characters are a lot of fun as well.

At the price point of 30 dollars, it is a steal. On normal, the entire game will take you 4-6 hours to simply complete all the levels available on first go. However, due to the loot, and the increased difficulty of hard/nightmare/cataclysm, and of the hidden tome/grimoires on each level to find, you will want to come back and play more. Even 70 hours in im still finding new areas I haven't noticed on prior playthroughs.\n\nThe combat itself is incredibly satisfying. Every weapon acts differently, and the grusome decapitation and dismemberment of rat men will never get old. The special skaven make it so that sticking together is a necessity, and yet still incredibly challenging. Add in the fact of the random spawns, and each playthrough of the same map will always turn out differently, and sometimes really crank up the difficulty when a skaven patrol rounds the corner at the worst possible time.\n\nAlso count in the fact that the developer has announced a massive free DLC pack for new weapons/features december 3rd, this is worth your time to purchase and have a great time.\n\nThe game is brought down to the fact of numerous bugs (although quite small, only few times have I noticed game/match ending bugs, maybe 3 times), but only by a small amount. Also, a bit of lackluster netcode makes it incredibly annoying when the host leaves, forcing the entire mission to restart from the beginning. When playing with friends however, this is never a problem.\n\nOverall, if your a fan of the warhammer universe, 9/10. If your not a fan, 8/10.\n\nA very solid and engaging game, which cruel RNG loot system will make you come crawling back for more, brought down only by the fact of small bugs littering the game like so much skaven filth.","November 13, 2015","true","168.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This experience comes from playing with friends to dropping solo with bots and with random players on Nightmare difficulty ( the 2nd to last hardest difficulty ).\n\nThings I will answer.\n\n1st: What are the mechanics of the game and how do they contribute to an enjoyable experience.\n\n2nd: Community , is it Toxic or friendly?\n\n3rd: Is it worth it?\n\n\n\nFor those who dont have much time I will simply tell you its a fantasy L4D with magic , swords and lots of dead rats. If you enjoyed L4D you may find a new game to play here and that you could try it out for and hour but if you dont like it then refund it.\n\nNow to the questions...\n\nMechanics...\nyourself and three others form a party of four seperate characters to take on the Vermintide , a horde of ratmen come to destroy your town. The first of these five classes I will go Into is the Soldier , he is mostly a melee character wielding either 2 handed hammers or swords to a mace and shield or sword and shield combo. The soldier usually will be in the front of a party and try to bash the mobs and tank it for the team. While most characters can also do this , the soldier and dwarf have access to shields that allow them to block and bash more often then their counter parts.\n\nNext we have the dwarf who plays very much like the soldier , however the weapons at a dwarfs disposal very a bit from the soldiers , for instance while the soldier can have a repeater rifle the dwarf can get flare guns that light up mobs of rats setting crowds ablaze.\n\nThen we have the mage ( My personel favorite ) This class is a power house that must manage their magic in the form of a heat management style where if you generate too much you will die but if you keep it under control you will kill EVERYTHING!!! ( insert power level joke here ). The mage has access to large AOE spells or very powerfull single target spells that can make or break the game depending on who uses it. The mage also gets a sword to help them ( I recommened the fire sword ).\n\nOnto the Elf , Do you like fast weapons? Do you like bows? Do you like heat seeking arrows??????? Then here's the class for you!!! Behold my bow that never misses its shots, I found a Bow that has heat seeking arrows and its great. The elf is however a great character for killing the trash mobs , the bows help a lot ( just like most secoandary weapons ) to kill the bigger more prominent foes so save that ammo for something tough.\n\nLast but not least the Witchhunter , This guy is great if you're looking for some gunplay , sporting duel pistols ( flintlocks actually ) and either a zwiehander or a sword and pistol. This guy is great for range firepower on a single target ( pistols with pierce would be awesome Fatshark! ) or you can get a repeater rifle for him aswell and use that to murder many rats. The pointy hat is also pretty great.\n\n\nOnto question two. Is the community "Toxic".... Kinda .... Ive been kicked simply becuase I wasnt level 100 ( which means nothing but you played the beta and had a lot of time on your hands ). Most players hate the grind like myself but becuase of the loot system , ( after each mission you roll dice to get loot , doing objectives gets you more loot such as tomes or finding dice in chests or of loot rats ) Players usually try to do all the objectives and most of the time a party will die trying to do most objectives and this has made my experience crap.. I'd rather pump out 3 matches on normal then try to roll for one good weapons becuase I can just craft weapons from the basic tier up.\n\nPeople in this game will boot you simply becuase they forgot to put the group on Invite only , people will boot you becuase you use a mic or dont use a mic. Experience's may vary....  My experience with people on Vermintide is VERY negetive... some of you guys might find great people but I ended up just running with bots ( which has gotten me far more loot then running with people on my end of things ). Its better to simply complete a mission then risk lossing it and wasting 30 minutes of your time.\n\n\n\nComplaints/cons: This game is brutal and I wish there was a moment where rats were not always coming at you even on easy. For some reason during my experience I encountered hordes far more often then people I watched on twitch.\n\nThis game doesnt really have a tutorial... It just kinda throws you in and points at stuff but sticks you with other players while you try to learn the game.\n\n\nFinally is Vermintide worth it??? Yes it is worth it but I would buy it and try to play with friends.","December 23, 2015","true","119.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Also the lack of checkpoints  really starts to annoy. It's awesome completing missions but when you can't and keep failing at one singular point..it'd be nice to resume from that point with a penalty rather than restart the whole bluddy thing.

I play primarily as the Dwarf and I have to say this is for anyone who ever wanted to fight through the Mines of Moria in LOTR. The higher the difficulty, the more spawns (which I LOVE), you have rat enemies that are the exact same as L4D (smoker, stalker, tank, spitter) but you also have machine gunners and armies of hard bad asses. This game is intense! and exactly what I think a coop needs to have! Now I need a good team, because the guys I played with didn't work together very well.","October 25, 2015","true","14.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its basically Left 4 Dead 2 with giant rats, a focus on melee combat, classes, and loot.\n\nSo far my only complaints are the occassional bugs I've seen involving teleporting and flying skaven specials, and the fact that certain weapons like the handgun and blunderbuss don't have reloading animations, they just move off the screen like how weapons in Star Wars Battlefront 2 would in first person. Its kinda awkward and makes it difficult to tell how much longer the reload will take, but I'm sure it won't bother some people.\n\nDesync has a habit of instantly killing you for whatever reason. Pretty annoying.\n\nAs someone who actually didn't enjoy L4D2 that much, so far I've had a lot of fun with Vermintide.

The skavens make for a great enemy and a well deserved break from the tiresome zombies that we see all too often in entertainment today. The looting system is what keeps the player coming back. Expect a lot of grind though, especially if you are aiming for good gear since loot is randomised. However, you get an opporunity to improve your chances for good loot if you pick up hidden tomes in levels. These tomes take up the inventory space that medical supplies would normally occupy, thus leading to some hardcore playthroughs on harder difficulties to ensure the tomes will reach the end of the level.  Sadly, the random nature of loot make for a game that can feel at times unrewarding, especially when you gain poor loot after beating levels at high difficulties despite picking the tomes.\n\nOn a more positive note, level design is greatl Some levels are linear, akin to Left 4 Dead, while others consist of picking up items, destroying skaven buildings, or defending locations while hordes of skavens storm at you from every side. The class based characters propose enough variety to encourage multiple playthroughs with each character and that is what makes the game better than Left 4 Dead to me. I love how different the Flame Mage and the Dwarf are, the first being a crowd control/AoE damage specialist and the second being a tank with an emphasis on melee although he is able to inflict range damage with his crossbow. All 5 characters feel different and that's what is so cool about it. Writing, voice acting and music are also excellent and fit the game nicely,.Special mention goes to the all-too-often hilarious dialogues.\n\nAll in all, if you're into Left 4 Dead, grab this game. I do not recommend playing the game solo since the bots are broken as of now and will more often lead you to your doom rather than the skavens.\n\nIt's also the perfect game to set up a creepy mood for Halloween.","October 28, 2015","true","32.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At the end of each mission, if successful, the players may roll for loot, using die, and having a chance at white, green, and blue rarity items; with white being the lowest and blue being the highest.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mettil/recommended/235540/","mettil","Mettil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mettil/","340 products in account","Incredibly similar to L4D with a focus on melee combat.  Overall a fun game but not without issues.\n\nPerformance is good overall though I wish the game would give you control over the post processing effects so people with sub-recommended specs could eek out more frames.  The game is CPU heavy.  I have a FX-8320 that I've overclocked to 4.0Ghz.  This is below the recommended CPU for AMD and I experience frame drops down to 30-40fps in heavy fighting and scenic open areas of maps.  My CPU temp approaches 58C and my mobo approaches 65C.  A little high, but doable.  If you have a comparable or lower end CPU be prepared to sacrifice visual fidelity for stable framerates.  I hope this improves after beta or we at least get more control over the graphics settings come launch.\n\nWith the exception of the gatling gun rat, the special enemies are carbon copies of L4D special zombies.  Managing supplies throughout the level works exactly the same as in L4D as well.  The developers played it very safe.  You have your main melee weapon, a secondary ranged weapon, a slot for a medical item, a slot for a buff item (extra speed/melee damage), and a slot for a bomb.  Sound familiar?  With Warhammer being such a diverse property, I'm disappointed the developers didn't try something new with special enemies or items.\n\nAs you play each level you find tomes.  Tomes are slotted in your inventory over medical items.  Having a tome in your inventory at the end of a level gives you a bonus die for the loot system at the end of each round.  You can also find bonus die on special Skaven.  At the end of each round, you roll dice to determine the quality of your loot reward.  The more die roll a glyph or rune or whatever it is, the better quality item you get.  Total RNG with no care given to what class you're playing at the time.  You could be playing a dwarf and unlock gear for the wizard.  This means you can swap heroes easily to try out new gear, but it also makes finding gear for a specific character you prefer a slog.  Gear can be upgraded to unlock special passive bonuses using material gained from salvaging items.  Alternatively, 5 items of the same quality can be upgraded to a random item of the next rarity level.\n\nCo-op vs AI is the only game mode.  As far as I know, there are no plans for a competitive mode where players also control special Skaven.  At $30, I think it's a fair price for the amount of content promised and replayability via the loot system.  If you were expecting this game to be something more than L4D, you might be disappointed.\n\nEdit:  Skaven have oddly long attack range for melee.  Melee attacks from even basic Skaven can hit you through objects and through other Skaven.  In choke points, you'll often be hit by melee attacks you never see because many of the models mush together.  All characters dodge the same distance and it's often useless unless timed perfectly since enemies will track you when telegraphing their attack.","October 18, 2015","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

But I really am enjoying this game.\n\n\nEXPLANATION AND POSITIVES\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIt is essentially Left 4 Dead 2, combined with a loot/upgrade system, character classes, and set in a Warhammer Fantasy setting.\n\nThe combat itself is about 80% melee (depending on what character you are playing) and the melee itself is a mix between Skyrim and Mount and Blade. A mix as in, a lot better than Skyrim (but similar), but not as good as Mount and Blades melee combat.\n\nThe Skaven (Rat people that take the places of zombies) are honestly fairly fleshed out, and seem to have alright personalities, they have their own banter towards the characters, and some even cower in fear when you show up, until they decide to mass rush you.\n\nThe loot system takes place after each wave, you are given a number of dice (That number changes depending on the difficulty, and what optional things ((Such as carrying around bulky tomes the entire map)) you have undertaken that map) You are then showed a scale of items, and the higher you roll, the better the items. Those items you can go on to upgrade in other ways as well.\n\nThe character classes have a bit of overlay, some weapon types are shared (Dwarf and Empire Soldier both get Two handed hammers for instance, but the hammers look and function slightly different), and they can all function well in both melee and ranged.\n\nThe characters also have a fair bit of...character....banter is common, and they are all fairly well fleshed out and voiced.\n\nThe graphics in this game are, honestly, fairly stunning, the metals, woods, and characters all look very well textured.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nNEGATIVES OR APPREHENSIONS:\n\nThis game is honestly, fairly Warhammer...with that comes a very "grimdark" and different setting, compared to many fantasy games - If killing Ratmen in a claustrophobic cityscape with the help of an alien looking elf is completely distasteful to you, you may want to think twice (But I would urge you to still give it a try).\n\nAs I said before, the company is an unknown, a few past interviews have said that they wish to continue supporting it with additional character classes, maps, and enemies. And while I hope they do, only time will tell if they live up to that promise.\n\nThe last gripe again, is potentially the setting, I need to stress this: Judging by early access and the games very screenshots, the majority of this games setting is within a giant city, filled with winding streets and cobblestone buildings, I hope that it does not get boring and dull over time.\n\n\n\n","October 19, 2015","true","60.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bilks/recommended/235540/","Bilks","B!lks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bilks/","391 products in account","There are already a number of great reviews on here regarding this game, so I'll just throw this in there to bolster the game.\n\ntl:dr - If you like Warhammer and/or you like Left 4 Dead then you will love this game.\nI went into this game a bit apprehensive, I had never heard of the team that made this game before and most recent Warhammer games (mainly 40k) in recent history have been very sub-par…\n\nHowever, I kept in mind that back in the early 90s when I was a kid, the Skaven were my army of choice when playing Warhammer tabletop and after seeing a lot of glowing reviews (Total Biscuit etc) and finding the game at a decent price, I thought stuff it I’ll give it a punt. And I’m glad I did.\n\nThe game play really took me back to the days where me and 3 other mates would jump on Left 4 Dead and just have a blast. This game seems to have taken all the good aspects of that and improved on them by adding classes, loot and collectables to improve the chances of getting better loot.\n\nHowever, that’s not to say that this game doesn’t have faults. I have experienced a number of graphical glitches where instead of heads being severed, the neck will extend with the head giving the character models a kind of crazy giraffe effect.  Clipping issues where I would for whatever reason get stuck in the ground or in a wall resulting in me either having to hope a special unit comes and kills me or I quickly reconnect (no good if I have a grimoire on me).\n\nSpeaking of the special units, the 5 that they have got (gutter runner, packmaster, poison wind globadier, ratling gunner, rat ogre)…. Let’s face it, they are direct copy and pastes of the Left 4 Dead specials. (in order, hunter, smoker, boomer…. Ok so the ratling gun is new but the rat ogre is the same as the tank). Vermintide even has its own version of the witch in the form of a patrol of Stormvermin (which should be avoided at all costs, especially on harder difficulties).\n\nI would STRONGLY recommend first playing this in a private server by yourself with 3 bots on easy to understand how the game works, get used to combat, how to dodge/block, when ogres are going to appear so that you know not to pick up the grimoire till afterwards (as it reduces your health). This in itself is not fun and does not give a good representation of the game BUT it means that you learn the basics in your own time and will not be a burden to your team. Remember this is a team game, you do not want to be the one that holding everyone else back.\n\nI hope this game continues to be as highly supported as it has been so far. It could do with some extra maps, more varied weapons and maybe dare I say it…microtransactions for skins (and I mean ONLY skins). I say this so that there is a flow of money that could be used for developments/free dlc etc…. but… we will see what happens when the expansions come out.\n\nAll in all, a pleasant surprise and would highly recommend","January 3","true","66.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love the rpg elements too, who are there to give you variants in preffered gameplay but not absolute dominion over the enemies. And ofcourse, the hats... Lots and lots of hats. The only "problems" i have encountered were that through some parts of a level you just get casual skaven, lots and lots of them, and u slice and dice them to pieces in no time, makes some instances... Less exciting?... But then baaam! You ge the packmaster, globadier, ratling gunner and a gutter runner, all at once, all wrecking your team in some tight corner, and you can just sit back and enjoy your own gruesome demise, unless youve got some sick reflexes and skills, that i so far dont have. But its still interesting, even at that point, especially if you survive. Oh and the other thing is... I hate those dice... Cus they hate me too, but i still love the hype in expecting new awesome loot after painstakingly collecting all the tomes and grimoires. Other than that, ive encountered some slight problems with the textures, and with the stats at the end initiating, but im sure the devs are already working on it if they havent already. As a huuuuge Warhammer fan i think this game perfectly represents the grim and the glory of the Warhammer world and lore.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kaymon95/recommended/235540/","Kaymon95","Kaymon95","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kaymon95/","300 products in account","If I could leave a neutral review on this particular game, I probably would.\n\nIf you're looking for a melee-focused, first-person, shield-and-slash kind of loot-farming L4D-like game, this game's for you.\n\nI've played enough of this game to have a lot of fun with it, but this is one of those games that's almost unplayable without people/friends. Sometimes there's not enough teamwork to succeed either, and eventually you might just get tired of playing the same maps over and over with very little entertaining end-game. Some players might continue though, because of the randomized loot system, which, although randomized, still feels pretty rewarding. Sometimes.\n\nCONTENT AND MISSIONS - There's a bit of a lack of content for Vermintide, not that there isn't enough to feel like a 'full' game, but you'll end up replaying maps quite soon into it. This is sort of to be expected of an early access title, but it needs more missions to play somewhat badly. Also, I think the game should be finished and released out of early access before they start making paid DLC's. Sure, the first is only $2.99, but it's a slippery slope.\n\nBut on the topic of missions, it almost feels like the variety doesn't matter since most people just run Horn of Magnus to grind loot, with a handful of other missions... It's a little disheartening for only 1 mission to be played so consistently.\n\nTEAMWORK - You'll probably spend the first 10 hours having fun and learning the game's mechanics. After that, you'll try your hand at the Hard, Nightmare, and Cataclysmic difficulties, as there isn't much of a point to run Normal or Easy difficulty if you want good loot. Sometimes you'll get teamed up with people who fall all at once and fail the mission, but you'll just have to keep at it to get better. Along with that, the bots are sadly not a viable alternative. In my early playtime, I tried to play Horn of Magnus on NORMAL with bots, got to the elevator at the end, where 1 rat hit me, knocked me to the ground so I'd need a revive, and Kerillian (the Elf bot) and Bardin (the Dwarf bot) just stood over my corpse, they didn't help me up.\n\nLOOT - Next 20-30 hours, you'll get some Greens (Commons) and Blues (Rares), an Orange (Exotic), maybe even 1 or 2 Trinkets, which really help out as their effects are independent of the Hero you're playing. These'll help you survive and deal better damage.\n\nBut I have some extreme gripes with the rewards system, as you collect special dice in missions that are used at the end to get a random reward of a loot item. It's either a weapon or a trinket, but on a very rare chance, it's a hat. But in order to get even this chance, you have to BEAT the mission, make it ALL THE WAY to the end and succeed. If you don't, all you get is exp, and even if you make it to the end but DON'T beat it, all you get is 8 CRAFTING TOKENS. The dice give you better chances at getting higher tiers of loot, but only if you win. And even then you might not get loot for the character(s) you play.\n\nOverall, it's a really fun and hectic game. It's visually great and pretty fun when things go right, but it's not without problems.","March 17","true","58.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Would you wish it had emphasis on melee instead of ranged weapons? Do you like the idea of killing ratmen? Do you NOT require a vs mode? If so, this is the game for you!\n\nFor a relatively low price you get an awesome way to kill your time in co-op horde gameplay. Vermintide is hard but rewarding on higher difficulties, forcing you to pay attention to crowd control as you methodologically hack the ratmen to pieces. The different weapons offer significant changes to gameplay, and there's enough of them to offer you something refreshing when you want to mix things up a bit. I'm not sure if the axes are quite on par with the others on higher difficulties, but maybe I've just not learned to cc well by relying on pushes or to take advantage of the other player's cc. Even so, I find the axes to be most satisfying weapons and just go for lower difficulties when I want to use them.\n\nLoot grind used to be more grindy than it is, but with the introduction of the Last Stand mode it's easier to upgrade the gear you like to the higher levels. Even so I'd recommend enjoying the gameplay and taking the loot as an additional creaming on the cake, offering nice rewards that open up new options as you play.\n\nIf you like the genre or are intrigued, I think you will most likely enjoy this game.","March 11","true","183.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IndomitableSloth/recommended/235540/","IndomitableSloth","Pope Matumbai IV","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IndomitableSloth/","209 products in account","Extremely fun cooperative action game, similar to Left 4 Dead. To say its a clone of Left 4 Dead I think does a disservice to this game. The game does enough where it sets itself apart from Left 4 Dead.\n\nThe levels are fun, and the loot although it can be frustating at times, gives a reason for replayability. The difficulty in the game doesn't come from cheapness, but from player skill. When you first start you'll think the highest difficulty level is genuinely impossible to do, but as time goes on you feel yourself getting better at the game and figuring out tactics and strategy with your party.\n\nWith that said, the game is alright to play with random people, but truly shines when you have friends to play with especially if you can all play it consistently.\n\nI look forward to any expansions or additional content. At the price as well, I don't feel uncomfortable paying for DLC provided its substantial enough and looks fun. When it comes to cooperative fun, all other games are Umgak.","January 15","true","137.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You should be playing it.\n\nOk, now for real:\n\nVisuals: This game visually looks amazing. The team did an amazing job with cramming tons of detail into everything in this game.\n\nEmersion: You really feel like you are a warrior/mage/whatever trying to help this city against an invading monster race. It's simplistic, but nails it in most aspects.\n\nStory: The story is super simple, but if you're playing this game for the story then you probably shouldn't buy it. You pick up tons of small details about the story as you play the levels, but it's not a story driven game.\n\nCombat: WOAH! Awesome...\n\nConclusion: I have never been so entranced by a midevil styled game before. Honestly they usually bore me, but this game is stellar so far.","October 18, 2015","true","77.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stormbloodbane/recommended/235540/","Stormbloodbane","Storm Bloodbane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stormbloodbane/","48 products in account","Ok, I understand how some people have said that this game is more of a left 4 dead feel. It totally is 100% like left 4 dead. You have special classes that represent left 4 dead special infected. The game is really fun with friends but with randoms it is meh. I will go down a list to show the variants and how left 4 dead is similar in the parenthesis since vermintide is the main topic here.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-Gutter Runner (Hunter)\n-Globe Lobber(kinda like the Boomer only thing is that this one deals damage over time without the mobs)\n-Skaven Ogre(Tank)\n-Packmaster (Smoker)\n-Ratling Gunner (I would compare this to a witch only thing different is that the agro is instant when spotted)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The game also has a levelling system in it that will give you items that you get after a certain level. There are also slots that open in customizing your character that will eventually open up items for you to use. For instance, you are a level 4 or below and there is a trinket slot that opens at level 5. (this is just an example, I don’t remember if that trinket slot is open in any certain level… more than likely not) you go to the end of a campaign and you roll for your loot (we’ll get back with that later) and you don’t see any trinkets that drop along the bar. But you have just levelled up to five and you get to roll and there is a trinket that is now droppable in the rolling sequence. If you have the slot open for a specific item, there is a fair chance that you would be able to get the loot drop for that slot when you have it unlocked for that level. Simpler terms, you get what you can use and you don’t get what you can’t even equip yet.\n\nNow, about this rolling, every single time you finish a mission successfully you get to make rolls. In each mission depending on which one it is, you get to come across these items that can help boost up your roll.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-Tomes  (+100 xp and adds one die with more successful sides when rolled)\n-Loot die (basic loot die that adds ontop of your normal 6 die pool)\n-Grimoire (reducing the party health by 33% and is consumable. Once consumed it will make the waves harder and you wont get the guaranteed roll on the guaranteed one die you get if you don’t consume it.)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Certain characters have certain traits about them that follow with the Warhammer age of sigmar realm or time. The elf is snarky towards the dwarf, the witch hunter is no fan of anyone but the soldier, the soldier is the all around whatever human that just chops ♥♥♥♥, the dwarf is not a fan of the magic that the wizard can conjure, and it is just overall an odd alliance.\n\nNow for you people wondering if there will be DLC’s coming out. I honestly don’t know but once you finish the only acts that are available, which hits at the maximum of four, there is an ending cutscene that certainly leaves and opening for other DLC content and I for one am excited for it.\n\nThis game is the first game of Warhammer that I have ever owned. I knew about it and played a lot of D&D and I enjoyed the lore. After playing this, I most definitely want to move over to the lore in Warhammer Age of Sigmar. If you enjoy good ol swordplay with specific roles and classes and love the left 4 dead playstyle… get this game… I highly recommend it. I wouldn’t say that this game is the best co op game cause I will say that Payday 2 is more up on my scale but this game is really fun. Out of 5 stars I would give this game a 4/5.\n","October 29, 2015","true","48.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game plays quite similarly to the Left 4 Dead franchise, which is great for those already familiar with the gameplay there. Different weapon types for each Hero offer a great deal of variety, and the upgrades you can get to these weapon can differ from those that another person gets from an identical weapon, making no two weapons alike (For the most part). Loot quality is improved by collecting certain items throughout a map to be rolled as dice at the end. I've had no frustrations with the items I've gotten, and I was able to hold my own on Hard mode the second I started this game without much trouble. I haven't experienced much in the way of bugs, and the 13 different levels offer a variety in the areas you play in.\n\nIn conclusion? Buy it. You probably won't regret it.","November 16, 2015","true","68.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The crunch of a rat skull under a warhammer will send shivers down your spine.\nAll 5 characters feel unique, and because groups are made up of four, you'll never get stuck without a choice.\nUnrelenting difficult at higher levels unless you work as a team and communicate effectively.\nIt will make you tense up. You will be anxious, wondering when the rat ogre is going to show up.\nRat Ogres.\nWhen you win, you'll feel like you've earned it.\nGear doesn't make the player. Skill does.\nNo pay to win at all.\nFree DLC.\nCons\nNot all weapons are made equal. While they can all be fun, only some are viable on harder difficulties.\nCommunicating with a public group can be brutal. Better hope they all know what they're doing on the highest difficulties.\nTutorial? We don't need no stinkin' tutorial.\nNo dedicated servers, if a host drops you restart the level. Bad lag can end a good run.\nThe loot system isn't generous, and you will be underwhelmed at times.\nThe rats have gatling guns.\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed L4D, or is interested in a co-op game that will have you at the edge of your seat cheering (or cursing) your friends as you wade through a sea of bipedal rodents with medieval weaponry against all odds.","January 19","true","20.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, it mainly focuses on melee weapons as all the ranged weapons are slow to shoot and reload. Also, 'nades are scattered in boxes, you got it, just like Left 4 Dead.\n\nHowever, the feeling of the world, character design and enemies all look unique. While the special "boss" enemies all aren't too original, that's really not the point of this game. It's derivative but it's also a lot of fun. Even with strangers. Lopping heads and arms off ratmen never really gets old.\n\nThe only disappointing part of this game is the lack of maps to go through and the declining community. Perhaps the developer needs to release more DLC more quickly because the loot system is amazing, the world is rich and the characters that you play as are all quite unique.\n\nI highly recommend giving this game a try. Just hope you have some people on your friend's list with it or you may have trouble finding a match unless you play above Normal difficulty.","January 24","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Altough it does not feature as much content as a blockbuster fallout 4 this team still made the most solid game I have played in a lot of days. I cannot emphasis how right combat feels in this game, and how good the challenge level is. If you exit the comfort zone and play hard, you WILL have a hard experience. You will fail with your team, but the sweetness of finally clearing a level makes up for it.\n\nNot only have they nailed the gameplay, but they release FREE DLC. From a businiess stand point this makes little sense, but from a quality stand point it's spot on. The game industry is decaying, favoring business plans and advertising over quality. I am glad to see that Fatshark goes against this trend, holding their ground and setting up an example for other game developers and publishers.\n\nGraphics are not exceptional, but quite excellent non the less. Audio is great as well. The atmosphere makes you feel like your really in a murky city where a terrible war(slaughter) broke out from beneath. The weapons are varied, and you will find what suits your individual taste the best.\n\nFor the best experience, get some good friends and buy this game.\nYou will get your moneys worth two-fold if you're into co-operative survival games.\nBUY IT AND THEN BUY IT AGAIN AND GIFT IT TO YOUR MOM AND CAT","December 3, 2015","true","51.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I like the game but it is pretty difficult to finish on higher difficulty without a coordinated team, which means basically stick together and hit everything in sight. There does not seem to be a lot of sophisticated tactics involved in the game or the environment at the moment. Occasionally you will use a bow or gun to snipe a difficult mob from a distance but the A.I. for the most part just focuses on constant zerg as it's main tactic. Graphics are nice and mindless combat can be fun but hopefully there is more planned in the future and the weapon upgrades become a little more dynamic. Right now I would give is a 3/5 with potential to increase moving forward.\n\nOne more thing every time a major Skaven rush occurs it seems the only objective is to find the rearest wall, put your back to it and swing your sword at the onslaught until the vermin are all dead. It can be fun and intense in a viseral way, but lacks depth and sophistication.","October 19, 2015","true","21.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't have friends to play with, i have a decent pc but not high end and i live in ♥♥♥♥ing south america where very few people play it... BUT the only real problem i found was the optimization droping my fps to 20-25 in very crowded parts, in every other regard i found it pretty good. It's so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun (for me of course), i thought because of negative reviews saying that it gets boring because of few mission vartiation but personally i think there's a lot of maps already(and each mission is 30 to 50 min) and they will keep launching more(i hope), it's a pretty new game and it's different difficulties (which for me are very good designed) make it very replayable. Also i saw like a ♥♥♥♥ ton of reviews complaining about the loot drops, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you want to play with only 1 character because of it's randomnes but if you're like me and like to variate the playstyle using different characters it's ok.

(In this case, it's the rat-men known as Skaven)\nYou and 3 buddies are charged with completing a variety of missions such as collecting supplies and gunpowder for the resistance, clearing paths for smugglers through the sewers or destroying Skaven war machines in their own camp ets.\nIn each you will be faced by a variety of enemies ranging from tiny, one-hit to kill, slave rat hordes to massive Rat Ogres who can soak up damage like a drunkard soaks up alcohol.\n\nIt's enjoyable and can become quite challenging at higher difficulties with more enemies and less pickups. (Even friendly fire is an option.)\nThere's a decent variety of weapons and classes to try out ensuring there'll always be something to suite your playstyle.\n\nIt's not perfect mind you, there's a bug or two that pops up every now and then but they're small enough to ignore or share a giggle at.

Even when we died horribly.\n\n+ The learning curve isn't so steep that new players are handicapped at the start screen. (Smite...).  Kill stuff, beat the mission, and get a new (sometimes dupe) weapon, or Trinket. Revel in glory, and repeat.\n\n+ The random encouters make each run feel different, as with the random item spawns. It makes you have to adapt to the situation, and adds some excitement. Nothing makes you crap harder to burn all your ammo on trash enemies for fun, only to be met with a Rat-Ogre around the corner.\n\n+ The sound design is great. The enemies feel 'alive' right before you turn them into paste with a hammer. Their little squeeks and insults are darling. It's worth mentioning that the enviromental effects are also very good. Lightning sounds like lightning. The steel sword clinks when it his armor. It's all very well done.\n\n+ Level load times are quick, considering the size of the maps. Im sure they load mostly on the fly, but it doesn't hiccup when the map is being generated. I'd take one big map over 5-6 little grinder maps. Keeps me engaged in the game more, I think. 2-3 of the maps feel similar, but aren't purposed the same. i/e One may be a straight run, while another is a objective (protect / destroy target), and another may be an item collection mission.\n\nNeut:\n= I run a potato, so I have no idea what the game 'should' look like.\n\n= The 360 controls, while better for dodging attacks, feel sloppy. KB controls just fine.\n\n= It's Left 4 Dead with rats. Special / Boss enemies are entirely transparent to that extent. It works though. [oops]\n\n= The end-game loot system / character progression doesnt break anything, balance wise.\n\n= The in-game 'Tomes' and 'Grims' you can collect is hard to do with less than 3 human players. You can manipulate the bots into carrying one, but it's a chore making sure they dont dump it for a medki- Health potion. So your end game rewards often suffer as a result.\n\n= Has hats... At least there's no pay to win B/S. Item crafting works well enough, despite the grind it takes to get anything worth while. It's slow, but atleast it's all in-game, and not credit card dependant.\n\nCons:\n- The game does not feel finished, not to the point of a gold code release (1.0+). I dont have a top-end machine, I have a morgage. I have all the settings down to potato, and there are times when the game dips to 10-15 fps. I can only deduce that there is some engine problems, that I HOPE get fixed / patched / what have you.\n---->  If I can run Fallout 4 on 'med' at [read; playable] 45+ fps, than antything else should run at atleast 30+ on low. And Fo4 is optimized like pure ♥♥♥♥.\n\n\n- Often times, you will run right into a random enemy pack spawn, and as a player, really breaks the flow of things. It looks like a blackhole is giving birth to 100 Jimmy Falons'. SOME GAMES are much better at enemy spawns, you know, like L4- nevermind. Either way, that shouldn't happen. It just looks / plays gross.\n\n- The bots. Period. I know it's meant to be played online with people. But still, there's no excuse for how dumb they are. If I want to be a socio, and not play on a team, I shouldn't witness death, after defeat, after death, because the bots thought transversing the map to kill a Gas-Rat was Delta-Level 5 Mission Priority.\n\nOverall;\nI feel like this could, and should be a household name like it's older, uglier brother 'Lefty'. It's fun, addictive, and has tons of replay value. I know I personally have to upgrade my setup, but despite that I have a good time playing. Maybe I'll wet my feet into an actual 4 man game. Until then, pardon me while I go scoure the wasteland for glue...\n\n8/10 - notIGN\n","January 9","true","76.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

However, it mainly focuses on melee weapons as all the ranged weapons are slow to shoot and reload. Also, 'nades are scattered in boxes, you got it, just like Left 4 Dead.\n\nHowever, the feeling of the world, character design and enemies all look unique. While the special "boss" enemies all aren't too original, that's really not the point of this game. It's derivative but it's also a lot of fun. Even with strangers. Lopping heads and arms off ratmen never really gets old.\n\nThe only disappointing part of this game is the lack of maps to go through and the declining community. Perhaps the developer needs to release more DLC more quickly because the loot system is amazing, the world is rich and the characters that you play as are all quite unique.\n\nI highly recommend giving this game a try. Just hope you have some people on your friend's list with it or you may have trouble finding a match unless you play above Normal difficulty.","January 24","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Better hope they all know what they're doing on the highest difficulties.\nTutorial? We don't need no stinkin' tutorial.\nNo dedicated servers, if a host drops you restart the level. Bad lag can end a good run.\nThe loot system isn't generous, and you will be underwhelmed at times.\nThe rats have gatling guns.\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed L4D, or is interested in a co-op game that will have you at the edge of your seat cheering (or cursing) your friends as you wade through a sea of bipedal rodents with medieval weaponry against all odds.","January 19","true","20.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its basically Left 4 Dead 2 with giant rats, a focus on melee combat, classes, and loot.\n\nSo far my only complaints are the occassional bugs I've seen involving teleporting and flying skaven specials, and the fact that certain weapons like the handgun and blunderbuss don't have reloading animations, they just move off the screen like how weapons in Star Wars Battlefront 2 would in first person. Its kinda awkward and makes it difficult to tell how much longer the reload will take, but I'm sure it won't bother some people.\n\nDesync has a habit of instantly killing you for whatever reason. Pretty annoying.\n\nAs someone who actually didn't enjoy L4D2 that much, so far I've had a lot of fun with Vermintide.

(In this case, it's the rat-men known as Skaven)\nYou and 3 buddies are charged with completing a variety of missions such as collecting supplies and gunpowder for the resistance, clearing paths for smugglers through the sewers or destroying Skaven war machines in their own camp ets.\nIn each you will be faced by a variety of enemies ranging from tiny, one-hit to kill, slave rat hordes to massive Rat Ogres who can soak up damage like a drunkard soaks up alcohol.\n\nIt's enjoyable and can become quite challenging at higher difficulties with more enemies and less pickups. (Even friendly fire is an option.)\nThere's a decent variety of weapons and classes to try out ensuring there'll always be something to suite your playstyle.\n\nIt's not perfect mind you, there's a bug or two that pops up every now and then but they're small enough to ignore or share a giggle at.

This game has all of the finer elements from the Left 4 Dead franchise that made it so replayable, and it puts them through the filter of the gritty Warhammer Fantasy universe. As a long time fan of Warhammer and Warhammer 40k, I am always watching for titles with the franchise name and giving them a thorough investigation before I would ever deem something that fell within my all time favorite fantasy universe great simply for having the name attached. Vermintide for sure delivers. You truly are pitted against the hordes of Skaven set during the End Times and it feels like a constant struggle to mix quick movement with thoughtful decision making. Sometimes you see a patrol that can easily be avoided or fought in a fierce melee, while other times you are moving safely through back alleys and suddenly a Gutter Runner has one of your party on the ground and a Packmaster is dragging another away and your group now dances on the knife edge of a full on wipe. These moments come all too often and really bring a good life to the game.\n\nThe loot system is another thing I found pretty interesting and acceptable. Loot is only earned on a successful mission completion, so it truly does force one to not rush forward hastily, however taking more time seems to draw in more ambushes and waves which can easily grow overwhelming.\n\nPositioning is an important aspect of the game and is to be used at all times.\n\nI really REALLY hope they make some Chaos force maps or other evil force DLC's, because thats what I think we'd all love to see.\n\nCons: The cons I do have are mostly with the servers and hosting. There is NO dedicated hosting, so hosts are on a player by player basis, which means that if your host decides to up and leave 3/4 through the mission, you are restarted back at the beginning of the mission with another player as the new host.","October 28, 2015","true","83.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is just as unpredictable and replayable with the added loot mechanism. The loot system is pure RnG and with my luck, I rarely get good rolls - but I try not to get hung up with the loot. I still unlock and find enough weapons to give my plays some variety. It is not a Diablo replacement for me, but an improved L4D. A good communicative team with a strong common understanding is far more important in this game.\n\nThe level designs are top notch and the maps are full of detail which create interesting atmosphere. The sound and music complements the action exceptionally well. I've played about 6 maps so far and i've been impressed with all of them. The Skaven AI do behave like the sneaky and cunning vermin they are - creeping up or dropping behind you to steal a stab in your back. They are annoying and extremely satisfying to butcher en masse.\n\nThe melee combat is impactful and satisfying. Far more so than L4D's. Also, getting quick ranged headshots and clever item use is more crucial than ever to survive. Many of the special Skavens like the gutter runners, ratling gunners and pack masters are really overpowered against individual heroes. They can easily take out a straggling player. This game can be unforgiving even at normal difficulties and requires good team tactics to succeed. Try playing alone with the (weak)AI BOTs on your side and you'll realize just having 3 more characters fighting on its own will easily get all of you killed. This game is not to be enjoyed as a single player game.\n\nIn terms of bugs - there are still some weird stuff like mobs hitting you through walls, clipping animation and fps drops when things get really busy, but otherwise I havent encountered anything gamebreaking. To me, it is a good game for a fair price at this stage. I just hope the developers will continue to be generous with content and reasonable with the pricing for future content. This game and Fat Shark has tremendous potential and I would love to keep playing this game for some time to come.\n\nWould try to swim in game and die instantly again - 9.5/10","December 29, 2015","true","307.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each player has a choice from five champions, each with unique abilities and weapons to choose from. In each level you play you have a certain goal you need to accomplish as a team where you will also be fighting waves upon waves of various skaven. At the end of each successful level, there is also a great random loot system based on how successful you were.\n\nAlthough much of the game is fast paced, occasionally stopping and looking at the surroundings is  amazing ; you can clearly tell that the developers put a ton of work into this.\n\nThe developers in this game are always trying to improve the game and add new content\n☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ 7/7","January 31","true","56.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Matchmaking FPS's are not my thing and I do not like them.\n\nWith that being said, I absolutely love this game. I have stuck with my dwarf sword/board so far and even though right now in beta there are only 3 maps. The game has great replayability.\n\nI will admit sometimes the hitboxes are weird with my ranged weapon and a few little glitches here and there, but nothing game breaking. The AI for the bots is very good, if you get stuck with them. It doesn't feel like you're escorting them.\n\nThe game has gear slots that you obtain through running these maps. Higher difficulty = Better chance at loot.\nSlots include head, weapon, ranged, and 3 trinkets.\n\nI really hope in the future we get a little more to customize our character, even if it's just cosmetic.\n\nThe combat feels like a fast paced and more responsive version of Skyrims combat.\nThe maps do a very good job at moving along, without feeling like that linear arcade style story.\n\nVery happy with my purchase. I wasn't so sure at whether or not this would be something I would enjoy, but took a shot in the dark and it paid off. I hope the development team continues to make content/DLC/expansions for this game.","October 18, 2015","true","41.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have always loved the setting and I'm love the game's atmosphere - the surroundings, sound and the banter between the heroes.\nDetached from my fanboy-ish love, Vermintide is a really fun game. It's fast, it's brutal and it's challenging, even on the lower difficulties. Usually compared to L4D, the similarities between those games are indesputable and it is quite obvious where Vermintide took its inspiration. In my opinion, however, it is the better game - of equal rank, at the very least, I assume, if you don't feel strongly about the setting. Obviously, meele combat is a huge part of the game, so get upclose, ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and don't buy Vermintide if you're looking for L4D or Ewww-volve like shooting action. There are ranged weapons and they are fun, but let's face it: nothing is as fun as a hammer to the face. If you're the owner of the hammer, not the face...\nOne thing you should bring into the streets of Ubersreik are friends. The bots, while not half bad, are bots and the randoms are...way worse than the bots. People who behave as stupid as they (probably) look, with the sole purpose to make other players' lives miserable. If, however, you happen to bring your buddies along, you're gonna have a fun time with lots of action, gore and dead rat-things.","May 28","true","36.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I liked the classes and what they had with them/what they could unlock, and how you could mix and match stuff to find the thing you liked most. People have been saying that this is basically L4D2 but with rats and.... They're damn right and I love it. My problem with the game is that some weapons didn't feel what I think would be right, such as a 2-handed hammer bouncing off regular rats with a regular attack, and some of the bugs that I've witnessed being "Patched" but people still saying that it hasn't been patched, like how some rats would be invisible for everyone but the host. Is it worth 30 dollars? I don't know, I haven't gotten too far in the game so I don't know how many missions there are. Once some of the bugs are fixed I'll probably pick it up and have some fun with it again.","May 29","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

L4Dead feels boring childish point-and-shooty arcade comparing to this!\n\nPeople whining about "horrible" loot system, but I find it one of the (if not the best) loot systems I ever saw! You see, you need to play higher difficulties like Nightmare or Cataclysm and get all the Tomes and Grimoires (which requires very good teamwork). You'll get exotic quality loot in no time (I managed to get 5 exotic weapons and 1 exotic hat in only 20+ hrs I played on this free weekend)!\n\nThe AI is marvelous, never seen something like that before. Enemies constantly flanking and silently comming from behind when you totally not expect it! Player must be on constant 360 degrees guard, especially on higher difficulties. I played Horn Of Magnus (first level) like 30 times or more, and never get bored! Every playthrough is different, you can meet 2 ogres, or none, you can meet Stormvermin patrol in open place where its easy to hide, or get decimated by it in close space etc. L4Dead maps are much more repetitive.\n\nIt has few non-fatal bugs: once saw Stormvermin (armored rats) patrol went through closed gate (explosive barrels bit) on Horn Of Magnus map, assassin rat has highly glitchy movement, Stormvermin patrol can spawn right on top of a player, Rat ogre might stuck somewhere for long time and not come to fight etc. But is very rare and can't ruin gameplay much. Still would be nice to fix it.\n\nBad teammates (or lack of them) is only real problem of this game. On free weekend there was no lack of players, IDK if there would be some problems with this when I will finally buy the game... You see, I was able to win a map solo with 3 bots (very stupid bots) on hard difficulty, so its really not that challenging. I enjoyed nightmare difficulty most, and for it you need minimum 3 good players. If you, unlike me, have 3 (!!!) friends you can play with, its totally not a problem, OFC.\n\nAnd yes, price is quite big for me, I may say "biting", even with sale. So I'll wait till Summer Sale for a better price. Never mind, used my last money and bought it now. Game too good!","May 29","true","136.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No fan made content!\n\nI am however a big fan of the Warhammer universe and coop and I had a ton of fun during the free weekend. However lacking the things stated above one will indeed get tired way to quickly. I would recommend it on sale and if you have friends to play with. Even I will probably end up buying it at some sale. It was however a dissapointment that the new DLC didnt add new enemies. I mean really? 9 euro for a couple of new maps?\n\nI played L4D 1 and 2 for hundreds of hours and I still play the second one at times. Why? Because they offer a lot more and being zombies creates diversity. As well as being 4v4 is more fun then you versus a computer all the time. It would be really cool to add a 4v4 to this game and it would have given it a longer lifespan.\n\nI recommend the game on sale for people who like coop but how a guy put 246 hours into this I have no idea.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gunscorer21/recommended/235540/","Gunscorer21","Elector Count Guns","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gunscorer21/","53 products in account","This game is absolutley one of my favorite First-Person games I've played in a couple years. I love the combat system in this\ngame, though it may remind you of a certain series (Left 4 Dead, also one of my favorite games of all time). Using the lore of Warhammer: End Times is a great concept and though I am prasing this game I still have some issues with it. So here is my list of Pros and Cons with the game.\n\nPros: 1. The combat system: The use of both hand to hand and ranged weapons in the game gives that since of immersion that a lot of FPS' don't have these days.\n\n2. The lore: I myself didn't know a lot about Warhammer lore before I played this game, as a matter of fact I was hyped about it because of the new Total War title that was coming out. After playing 5 hours of this game I was hooked, I researched a lot about Warhammer fantasy and now I'm looking at 40K(and it is amazing)!\n\nCons:\n1. Repetition: Like it says though I've only played 15 hours of this game and it is not because I don't like it, I love this game. The reason I don't play this game like I used to is because I just got repetitive. The main villian of the game are known as the Skaven, ( giant rat people) and its like Left 4 Dead in the sense that you fight the same enemies ever level.\nSame bosses, same infantry, the one redeeming factor about this is that you can counter the enemies quickly.\n\n2. The Grind: This part of the game makes me sad. To get descent weapons you are going to have to play the same levels\nover and over and over again just to get enough XP and gemstones to upgrade and get loot. With the each DLC comes more objectives and weapons, but to get them takes close to 8 hours of grinding.

I liked the classes and what they had with them/what they could unlock, and how you could mix and match stuff to find the thing you liked most. People have been saying that this is basically L4D2 but with rats and.... They're damn right and I love it. My problem with the game is that some weapons didn't feel what I think would be right, such as a 2-handed hammer bouncing off regular rats with a regular attack, and some of the bugs that I've witnessed being "Patched" but people still saying that it hasn't been patched, like how some rats would be invisible for everyone but the host. Is it worth 30 dollars? I don't know, I haven't gotten too far in the game so I don't know how many missions there are. Once some of the bugs are fixed I'll probably pick it up and have some fun with it again.","May 29","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was on that level where you have to grab the black powder canisters and we had 7/8 of them. The host got knocked down and on the middle of us killing the mob on him he rage quit and we had to do the whole thing over.\n\nThe melee weapons appear to be hit scan weapons.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Amanofmanyfaces/recommended/235540/","Amanofmanyfaces","No DI","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Amanofmanyfaces/","62 products in account","Let me start off by saying this game is fantastic. It is NOT just a re-skin of L4D. There is so much more to it than that. Every character/class is unique in their own way, whereas in L4D all the characters are pretty much the same. Even the 'Specials' have their own unique flavor, AND they correspond to actual units used in the Warhammer Fantasy Skaven army, which is pretty darn cool. And not only are the classes different, but they all get types of weapons that are completely unique to their class, too.\n\nI do have a problem, though. So recently, my brother let me play this game on his super beefy gaming computer. The game ran like a dream; 75 fps running it on Extreme (this game's version of Ultra). The game was immersive and atmospheric. There were no bugs whatsoever, and it was fantasticly fun.\nSkip to me playing on my less-than-beefy laptop. I'm having to play this game on lowest at a reduced resolution than what is native to my laptop, and I know it sounds ridiculous, but i feel like lowering the graphics hinders the performance of the game. A whole slew of bugs that weren't there before emerged when i began playing on my laptop. Skaven would spawn in heaps and not even move; just waiting for me to pull out my blunderbuss and shred them all to pieces. A rat ogre even spawned on a rooftop! The bots were unbelievably stupid (they were already pretty dumb, but here they were even dumber). It was so strange. A game that previously had been almost flawless was rendered buggy and far less fun to play.\n\nSo my summary? This game is fantastic.... when it works correctly. I can't think of any instance where a game's graphics cause it to function incorrectly, but that really seems to be the problem here. I still recommend it because i've seen what it can be.\nMy brother and I haven't had a chance to play online yet, so i've only played local with bots. But i'll update this review if these problems listed above persist when we play online.\n\n","June 3","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alpercedocefruto/recommended/235540/","alpercedocefruto","Alperce | kickback.com","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alpercedocefruto/","57 products in account","Vermintide is one of those rare games where it's pretty much a rip-off of a great game but where it expands upon it in pretty much all the right places, and underline that pretty much. The Warhammer setting works amazingly with the L4D2 gameplay, and the slight changes over the special enemies combined with the different class purpouse system, with 5 different classes to choose from, adds an RPG like feel to the whole game that really makes you appreciate the effort of the developers in keeping the game as close as possible to the Warhammer universe. Bombs, health packs and potions, all remind you of the '09 valve classic that inspires this game and it's pretty much a blast to go back to campaigning with your friends against countless enemies, scarse supplies and the all new quest for the sweet old loot introduced in Vermintide. The five difficulty levels on each level also add to the replay value, aswell as improving your loot and rewards from completing missions.\n\nTeamwork is essencial in Vermintide and, pretty much as L4D, its live toguether or die alone. Small aditions like patrols to hide from, loot mice running arround and special tokens that increase your end-level rewards also add a fresh feel to the game to break from the monotonous routine of doing the same levels over and over again. The levels themselves come extremely well designed, with 13 very well crafted levels that brings the city of Ubersreik to life in a very dark, gritty way and that follow the journey of five heroes trying to save the town in the Warhammer: End Times setting. The sound design is very good aswell, creating an enjoyable atmosphere throughout the gameplay. The games controls are very much like L4D's with improved, more visceral melee combat that makes combat a very fun experience, with body parts flying arround and piles of corpses painted with blood crowding the heroes as they follow their missions. At the end of each turn, you earn experience towards your player level, something which seems to have no effect other than an ego-booster but it's fun to watch your number grow. The search for loot is also one of the games most atractive points, making you strive for better gear and making your risk leave behind health supplies, or even health points, in order to bring back special Tomes and Grimoires that make your end-mission loot better.\n\nThe game is not, however, perfect in what it attempts to do. One of L4D2's most incredible parts was the Director 2.0 AI that pretty much reacted to every move you made in your matches, creating uniquely balanced, varied and challenging experiences for the players and at the same time improving the overall replay value of the game due to how enjoyable it made it. While I find Vermintides AI competent, I think at some point it proved to be quite unbalanced in some aspects, and I won't talk about the usual BOT mind numbness. The game can at some point attack you with large number of very, very difficult opponents, from Rat Patrols to Ogres, and at some points I've met the game sending them all at once against an already debilitated team with very scarce supplies. While I appreciate a challenge, several times I came across impossible to go through situations that would be impossible even at full health, at least in the Nightmare or harder difficulties. Some balancing issues in the technical department make the game run not-so-well in it's highest graphical settings, with unstable framerates plaguing it at some points, something on which the developers seem to be working on, to their credit. Some bugs and exploits are also yet to be fixed, but two patches since the game and its release make me hopefull that the developers are fully aware of the incredible potential of their own game. The games loot system, besides being one of the games most fun mechanics, is also one of the most frustrating due to how limited it is in your part in the looting process. At the end of each match, you roll a set of dice that decide which reward you get from a pre-set random scale of items. Although the items themselves are varied and well designed, the system makes it very hard for you to collect the pieces you want, and it's so frustrating to see that item you so desperately need be lost due to you rolling your dice not too low, but too high!\n\nOverall, Vermintide is a wonderful game full of personality, grit, violence, teamwork and fun. If you enjoy collecting loot, killing mice, RPG-like classes, spending time at an inn jumping arround while you wait for your next mission in your quest to save Ubersreik, L4D's gameplay, the Warhammer setting or any of those combined, then you'll probably love this game. It has it's flaws, but it's also being developed by a dedicated independent team that has struck gold with their revival of one of Valve's most revered classics, and I hope they continue to improve their already great game. The memories Vermintide brings back are priceless, the long nights of L4D2 campaigning, victory, defeat and frustration were sorely missed by gamers all over, and this game's just right to fill that space until valve releases some info on the third instalement of their series. Whether you play alone or with your friends, you'll find many hours of excitement and fun in Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide.\n\n8/10\n\n\n\n\n\n","November 2, 2015","true","91.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I had no idea it is actually secretly a better current Left 4 Dead. It is Left 4 Dead with the theme you see in the trailer. Instead of zombies, you get rat people. It is JUST like Left 4 Dead, but it is new and instead of guns, you have different classes, each with their own ranged weapon types and melee weapon types. Each class so far from what I have seen, have two different types of weapons you can have, maybe more, same goes for ranged weapons as well I assume, haven't seen those yet. There is also a sort of random loot system as well.\n\nIt has that great co-op fun feeling as L4D had. It doesn't feel like a reskinned version, not by a long shot, but it takes all the great elements that made L4D fun, and makes it a different theme, and it makes it much more challenging and diverse. I highly recommend this to everyone that likes co-op centered games. Of course you can play by yourself with bots, but it is the same as playing L4D with bots, and therefore not recommended.\n\nGet this game. It is beautiful and fun as hell.

There are a lot of little changes next to L4D, of course. It's Warhammer Fantasy instead of zombies in modern post-apoc era, it's got this random loot roll thing at the end of matches that gives you a feeling of progression, and the game has a tight focus on melee over L4D's more shooty-shooty engine. But like L4D, this is a co-op hoard-murder game that asks you to get from point A to point B without getting bulldozed and it does it in a way that's both fresh and familiar at the same time.\n\nI would say this game falls into the 'small group co-op genre' very nicely and I tend to play it when I feel like Payday 2 has gotten stale or when I want to just rip through a zillion rats instead of PD2's more structured, objective-focused format. Gameplay is stable and visceral, graphics are nice, and the loot is a good hook to keep you coming back. Overall, very nice game, it feels very rewarding to get better at the game since the twitch skill is so important here.\n\nIf you already have enough of these sorts of games, don't run out and buy it; it's very much just 'another game I play with my friends' and probably isn't worth more than a $5-$10 pricetag. If you're a Warhammer enthusiest or just sort of on the fence, it's a good game.

I don't think that does it justice. Vermintide plays more like a cross between Payday 2 and Skyrim.\n\nI say Skyrim because melee combat is a mechanical focus and is executed so that it's easy to pick up and hard to master. Payday 2 is a mention for me because of the team challenge factor Vermintide features. Careful communication and teamplay is absolutely necessary in the higher difficulties and even on normal-hard when picking up Grimlores.\n\nVermintide has left me wanting more of everything it provides: haunting and intruiging level design, fun and interesting characters, a diverse range of special enemies and quirky AI. Having said that, the game isn't at all lacking in content or replayability and is worth its full price as is.","November 30, 2015","true","43.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

You find yourself in Ubersreik; a large human city in shambles while being overrun by large rat-like creatures known as the Skaven.\n\nThis game takes inspiration from a few big games, the most noticeable being Left4Dead. (Which is not a bad thing) There aren't many games out there like L4D, and since I've been praying for L4D3 to come out for years now, I'm happy to see another developer make a L4D style game so well. That's not to say this game is just a reskin of existing games. Vermintide has a fun and easy to jump in to combat system, making use of many weapons from daggers to giant war hammers and even to flaming combustion magic if you choose to play as the Bright Wizard.\n\nVermintide also sports an interesting loot system. The 5 classes all start with completely different weapons that all function differently and have different stats. As you complete campaigns, you will get guaranteed weapon drops for leveling up, but also a chance to get rare loot by rolling dice at the completion of a mission. Your party can improve their odds at getting better loot by working together to bring certain items to the end of a campaign, adding a huge risk vs reward element.\n\nCheck it out with some friends and have some good fun.","December 5, 2015","true","47.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The only real progression is levels and better loot on harder difficulties. So the game may feel old from time to time, with friends the fun never ends.

The combat mechanics are well-polished and fluid, deviating from the standard hack and slash instead requiring teamwork on the harder levels to survive as well as mechanics such as dodge, block and push especially when dealing with commanders, vermintide and rat ogres. Also, the ability to be any kind of player with any character is quite encouraging. You can play a fodder clearing dwarf with a dual wielding battle-axe and dual fire pistols or a defensive dwarf with a shield and a single handed thor hammer responsible for protecting your teammates. Also, the maps are well- made, expansive and immersive almost as if open world, the visuals stunning living up the quality of the newer games and the enemies diverse requiring different approaches to deal with. Also the devs seem to take a proactive approach to continuously update this game  and the future looks bright.\n\nOnly concerns i have would be the loot system as it may not be to everyone's taste and liking. Furthermore, hopefully more gamemodes will be added to the game for a larger diversity.\n\nRegardless, this is a fantastic game that i would recommend for all audiences. It will be a wonderful, fullfilling experience well worth the price to pay.","November 11, 2015","true","75.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The level designs are entertaining, and the battles are adrenaline inducing.  Usually I go in for PVP games, not coop PVE, but this game is challenging enough that working as a team is quite fun.  The banter between characters is surprisingly well done and situation appropriate.  And the art work is VERY well done.   My favorite classes to play are the Dwarf, the Elf, and the Bright Wizard.   Definitely worth the $30.  Would buy again.\n\nThe only downside is that there are a few players who try to do gimmicks and terrain cheats which usually end in utter failure, but mostly people just want to have fun and support each other the way the game intended.  In my limited experience, my groups succeed every time they play a level with legitimate skill  But every time they try to cheat, they die anyway.

All the classes are distinct from each other and each class feels different from the other. The class haracters all have distinct and funny personalities which I quite enjoyed. While the gameplay is very enjoyable, there are some problems I feel could be worked on.\n\nThe loot system rewards players with a new item after completing every stage, by using a dice system. You can obtain more dice depending on how many collectibles (tomes & grimoires) you found during the level. There are 3 tomes and 1 grimoire in ever level. This is a good system that motivates you to complete a level. However, I have experienced that, since I know the location of all the 3 tomes and the one grimoire in a certain stage, I will just replay that stage over and over. There is little actual motivation to try any of the other levels once you know the optimal way to run one stage, since the loot system only gives you one item at the end of the level, and each level only has 3 tomes and one grimoire to collect anyway.\n\nAs for the technical aspects, some have reported poor performance. I am able to run the game at a constant 80+ FPS, but will experience frequent frame drops, something I believe will be fixed in the future, with the addition of new drivers, and such. The graphics are pretty, but nothing out of the ordinary, so the framerate should be a lot smoother.\n\nIn conclusion, the loot system and variety could be improved, but Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide is still a great and fun game that I definitely recommend you pick up and try if you have a couple of friends willing to play with you. It comes at 28€ which is a great value for this game.\n\n7.8/10","October 22, 2015","true","12.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Seriously... the differences between the characters are minimal, the game plays exactly like L4D did.  The special enemies are almost identical... one that jumps on you and pins you, one that grabs a player and drags them away, one that throws poison clouds, and one that's a giant death melee machine.  There are a few more specials like the gunner that mows you down at range, which is a nice change-up.  But really the biggest difference between this game and L4D is the loot system.  In L4D you get weapons as you play in each level.  In this one you pick your weapons going in, and you stick with them for the map.  But, you get new gear as you play and can upgrade that gear.  It's L4D with a loot and experience system.  XP doesn't unlock abilities or anything, it just unlocks a couple more trinket slots as far as I can tell.  But then I don't have a trinket for my starting slot...\n\nIf you liked Left 4 Dead, you'll like this game.  All the same strategies and tactics apply.  Unfortunately, that also means just like in L4D bots are nearly worthless and human players that go rambo charging in will only hurt your team.

Battles are fought furiously over a range of stunning locales and each weapon and every class has a well-defined role to play in vanquishing the nefarious Skaven horde. Vermintide's loot system adds replayability to the game and encourages players to take on tougher missions. 9/10.\n\nGrapes:\n+ Well-balanced character classes that complement each other well and require effective teamwork on the harder difficulties. This is enhanced by changing each characters' weapon loadout - do you take a crossbow for range and accuracy or a repeater pistol for mowing down smaller rats?\n+ Gorgeous graphics and thumping sounds. Fighting in the Warhammer world has never looked or sounded this good. This makes fighting/ bisecting/ decapitating/ shooting the Skaven a real pleasure.\n+ Beautiful and well-designed levels that aren't necessarily the same in every playthrough (check out The Wizard's Tower level!).\n+ A loot system that rewards finding hidden items and playing on the hardest difficulties (which also improves the game's replayability).\n+ A range of enemies that all require a slightly different approach (although Fatshark twists some Warhammer lore to get them in their roles).\n+ A solid and helpful community that play the game; sharing the location of tomes and grimoires (to improve the chances of better loot) and generally helping each other out in a game. I've only been knowlingly trolled once in 30+ playthroughs, by some fool who read the grimoire and waited till the end of the map to put a tome in a location inaccessible by the rest of us.\n\nGripes:\n- The biggest con for me is host player dropouts. If the host drops out of a game, the map restarts. That's it. The game simply doesn't allow you to continue or even provide you the option of going to the inn to choose another mission. So you have to sit in a loading screen mulling over your fury. While this issue is generally limited to public servers, it is infuriating. Please fix this Fatshark!\n- Whilst being one of its biggest strengths, the game's loot system also causes the most controversy. If players are defeated in a mission, no rewards are provided, only some crystals that allow you to unlock gear traits. The level of gear awarded at the end of a mission is also effectively down to a random number generator, which many find madening, but I actually quite enjoy to a certain extent.\n- The game's matchmaking can be rather poor, attempting to find/ join missions and seemingly failing over a period of ten minutes or more. Fortunately the player can simply select a mission from the server browser to get around this gripe.","January 2","true","38.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It deviates from the L4D formula slightly in a few areas most noteably the loot system, the characters offer banter to each other in game which is a nice little touch when fighting off a tide of rats.\n\nOne of the things i really like about this game is way you earn drops, firstly you have to complete the level and while running through you can pick up 3 "tomes" these books replace your medical supply slot but you can put a tome down to pick up a health pot or kit then pick the tome back up which is fair. if you get these 3 tomes to the end of the level you get3 bonus gold dice on your loot roll.\n\nAn added challenge that brings more risk but offers better rewards is the Grimoire, there are 2 of these and they take up a buff potion slot, they also take away from your maximum health the first one takes about 25% of your max health away the send one leaves you with only 25% of your max health. If you succesfully bring these grimoires back you get 2 green dice on your loot roll.\n\nyou can also find random loot dice laying around the map in chests but i dont know too much about them yet.\n\nOn the store page the 3rd video trailer shows how the loot is rolled and the success ratio of each dice at around the 3 min 50 second mark.\n\n\nSo far i have only played on normal in public games and most people are helpful and tolerant but i have met people who refuse to help or carry those who have only just started the game for the first time. I look forward to playing this game with 3 friends on the higher difficulties and finding better loot.","November 2, 2015","true","4.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

All the classes are distinct from each other and each class feels different from the other. The class haracters all have distinct and funny personalities which I quite enjoyed. While the gameplay is very enjoyable, there are some problems I feel could be worked on.\n\nThe loot system rewards players with a new item after completing every stage, by using a dice system. You can obtain more dice depending on how many collectibles (tomes & grimoires) you found during the level. There are 3 tomes and 1 grimoire in ever level. This is a good system that motivates you to complete a level. However, I have experienced that, since I know the location of all the 3 tomes and the one grimoire in a certain stage, I will just replay that stage over and over. There is little actual motivation to try any of the other levels once you know the optimal way to run one stage, since the loot system only gives you one item at the end of the level, and each level only has 3 tomes and one grimoire to collect anyway.\n\nAs for the technical aspects, some have reported poor performance. I am able to run the game at a constant 80+ FPS, but will experience frequent frame drops, something I believe will be fixed in the future, with the addition of new drivers, and such. The graphics are pretty, but nothing out of the ordinary, so the framerate should be a lot smoother.\n\nIn conclusion, the loot system and variety could be improved, but Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide is still a great and fun game that I definitely recommend you pick up and try if you have a couple of friends willing to play with you. It comes at 28€ which is a great value for this game.\n\n7.8/10","October 22, 2015","true","12.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Some bugs and connectivity issues.\n\nVermintide gave me exactly what i expected it to give me. It is a great game for playing an hour or two and then going to do something else. Quests take a felt 15-25 minutes and are nicely balanced. The voice acting is quite nicely done and helps to immerse in the game world at least on the first playthrough.\nLike in L4D missions are much easier with a crew that keeps together and uses the classes well. Playing through the campaign on normal took me a combined 6 hours but the loot system keeps me wanting to play and i would like to see some dlc adding more missions and equipment.\nThe combat mechanics are fun and the game encourages you to use all of your abilities and try different characters.\nEnemies work very similarly to l4d, you have your basic fast attackers, assassins, swarms of weak enemies and a big tank enemy. Since those enemies are not brainless zombies though (but indeed pretty awesomely designed intelligent rat creatures destined to bring the apocalypse upon the world) there are some more advanced ctitters with poison grenades, chokehold sticks and miniguns which require teamwork to be defeated.\nI did have some connectivity issues which were probably host-dependent since the game has a system which automatically assigns a host. Failing missions over and over due to suddenly losing connection to a host is frustrating and i hope future patches will fix this issue.\nOverall i can recommend this game to anyone who enjoys first person hack and slash games and wants a quick rewarding experience with a dark, bloody art style,","December 8, 2015","true","18.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I know how much of a pain hit boxes are, but hit detection needs to be improved.\n- small window of frontal invincibility when shoving. currently (tho it doesnt happen too often) i take damage from the front when shoving. thats fine on lower difficulties but on Nightmare its a significant amount of HP.\n\nSPECIALS (because its vermintide not L4D):\n-I'm just going to say it. Gutter rats do not add ANYTHING to the experience. I can slay a rat ogre single-handed but i cant get a 50lb rat of my chest -_-\nImagine playing a game that incorporates a random black hole spawner that you cant evade 80% of the time no matter what and kills you instantly... sound like fun to anybody? yea, me neither\n\n-Rat Ogres: not anything really that wrong with them, however, i think they could be implemented better.\n1) need more damage indicaters.\nAt 50% health the rat ogres limbs can be hacked off it's body(ogres attack pattern would have to change             accordingly)\nAt 25% health ogres head can be taken, slaying it instantly\n\n2) ogres are fun to fight, its a cool enemy type, but you only get to fight one per level(if that). You could lower the health of the rat ogre so that you can spawn more of them without overpowering the player(s)\n\n-Gas Rats: perfectly fine, except when more than one spwns at a time\n\n-Pack Master: <-------THAT is what have replaced your L4D hunter not the gutter rat. The pack master at least makes sense. Also think a horde of pink rats to accompany each one would be neat as it is called a PACK master.\n\n-Ratling Gunner: once again perfectly fine except when two spawn at once\n\nI get that the specials are there to keep players in a group, but dont twist the players arm into doing it because\n1) sometimes you have to play with bots\n2) sometimes you just feel like soloing, to be an ♥♥♥ and say we dont care how you want to play, you have to play the game as origionally intended and not go outside the lines because we'll ♥♥♥♥ you with our instagibbing special rats.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Error666_UserNotKnown/recommended/235540/","Error666_UserNotKnown","Sensei Aaron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Error666_UserNotKnown/","235 products in account","TL;DR: Left for Dead with swords, and that's a compliment.\n\nSo after playing a fair amount I can now say that this game is a blast. Seeing how this is a Left for Dead clone and everyone knows it, I will simply discuss what sets this game apart from the game series we all know and love.\n\nFirst and foremost it's the melee combat. This game is all about it, and even though there are ranged-focussed classes as well, melee remains an unavoidably large part of the game. And it works well enough. I am kinda missing the option to differentiate between strikes (instead of light/heavy they could have gone full chivalry and made left-swing/right-swing/overhead/stab attacks), but the hit detection and feedback are awesome. I am especially enjoying the dwarven hammer, which gives a satisfying thump and will bounce off armored targets but just sweep lighter targets along. The feedback is phenomal and feels brutal. Swords were a tad less over-the-top, but they still feel sturdy and hard-hitting. Also blocking. Whereas in L4D you have to shoot infected before they can even hit you, there is no such ranged option in Vermintide. Blocking, shoving and dodging are essential to prevent being damaged. This makes large hordes and being surrounded particularly dangerous, as you cannot block all around you, and you can't dodge anywhere when there's rats everywhere. It makes it all feel a lot more engaging than just mindlessly blasting the hordes. It makes staying together even more important, as a good group of commons can and will kill you, and in L4D I didn't even see commons as a threat.\n\nThen there's the five classes, which all have a unique role. There's a crowd-focused melee, a single-target melee, an allrounder, a crowd-focused ranged and a single-target ranged. Collectible loot gives some flexibility in the role a character has, and of course all the character have the ability to fend off hordes, some are just better at it than others. The loot system will drop you a single weapon after each mission based on a dice roll (yes, literally a virtual dice roll), with some items scattered around each map that give better chances for rare ones, and grimoires that lower max hp for the rest of the mission in return for a fairly hefty boost to your odds. Failing a mission, however, nets you nothing.\n\nThe enemies are virtually the same as in L4D2, there's commons, armored ones, and a range of specials like the spitter, stalker, smoker and tank. Of course all reskinned as rats. They do the same job as the ones in L4D2, force teamwork. If you stray too far, a packmaster will simply sweep you up and hang you. But I feel the rats are a welcome change in the zombie-ridden gaming scene. I like having a horde game with more inspired characters than your every-day zombie. Speaking of inspired characters, this game does a phenomal job of bringing the Warhammer lore and universe to life. The characters have clear personalities that are reflected in each line of dialogue and there's a clear story for every mission. There's not really a story mode, but it's more like an overarching story and a bunch of lore interwoven in the individual missions. Combined with some ridiculously gorgeous levels this game does suck you into its universe. The detail even comes back into some cool weapon discriptions and cosmetic description, though sadly the background on weapons is reserved for the rarest ones.\n\nSome of the less awesome parts of this game, however, have to be the fact that the game is very short if you wouldn't replay it (hence the 30 dollar price tag I suppose). With 13 missions that aren't much longer than 30 minutes at best, and some missions being only a few minutes, about 5 hours would be enough to see it all. You'd have to be the kind that seeks a challenge on the more insane difficulties to really get your value out of this one. The fact that more difficult mission yield more interesting loot will help with that. There's also the fact that matchmaking is rather dumbed down (though it covers the basic options) and the fact that the inventory and crafting system are represented with a forge and your storage chest. Perhaps this is keep immersion up, but it is also less functional than a good old menu. Now you'll have to virtually walk, which is tiresome. Another minor gripe is that while playing, the busy streets and weird architecture combined with the in-style HUD can't help but slightly disorient you and have you lose your overview. L4D did an amazing job of making clear what you have to do and what the team's status is, Vermintide is just a little less in that regard. However, you will get used to it to the point where you'll barely notice it once you start to learn the levels.\n\nGameplay-wise my major gripe is the 'a.i. director', which is also taken from L4D and 'intelligently' spawns enemies and hordes. I found that on occasion, he was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Though he is essential to keeping the replays actually worth playing, he can also pull the most enfuriating and unavoidable ♥♥♥♥. He has to be there, but he has to be smarter. Spawning a rat-ogre on a cliff-walk is not okay. Neither is spawning a suicide bomb on us just as we're getting in the escape vehicle. Then finally, the mission length and difficulty are wildly irregular. One mission can be a 30-minute adventure while another is a 3 minute cake-walk. They all look awesome and they have a varied setting though, some taking place underground or in the woods, others in the city, at the docks etc. I never found myself bored with the scenery, it all has a very grim and gritty vibe to it that actually brings across the end-world feel.\n\nSo, in total, this game is well worth the 30 dollar price tag for anyone who enjoyed L4D or anyone who enjoys hitting vermin with metal. Qualitatively it's still a step below L4D, but not a large one, and it's uniqueness is a welcome change. Judged as its own game, this stands well above the average with one of the best co-op experiences combined with a super cool setting, and I can only hope that in these uncertain days of gaming, the devs will continue to support and care for their community. Adding in some more maps in the form of paid DLC would be most welcome, but let's not turn into Overkill Studios. Please. I have trust issues.\n\nAaron's score card score: 8\n\n1. Drinking bleach > playing this game\n2. Less bearable than Russell Brand.\n3. Complete garbage worthy of no-ones time.\n4. Obviously the developers just don't care about games.\n5. Bland and rough around the edges.\n6. MEDIOCRE!\n7. There's some merit to this game and some fun to be had.\n8. A damn good piece of work.\n9. Phenomal work that you CANNOT pass up.\n10.

I don't think that does it justice. Vermintide plays more like a cross between Payday 2 and Skyrim.\n\nI say Skyrim because melee combat is a mechanical focus and is executed so that it's easy to pick up and hard to master. Payday 2 is a mention for me because of the team challenge factor Vermintide features. Careful communication and teamplay is absolutely necessary in the higher difficulties and even on normal-hard when picking up Grimlores.\n\nVermintide has left me wanting more of everything it provides: haunting and intruiging level design, fun and interesting characters, a diverse range of special enemies and quirky AI. Having said that, the game isn't at all lacking in content or replayability and is worth its full price as is.","November 30, 2015","true","43.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Seriously... the differences between the characters are minimal, the game plays exactly like L4D did.  The special enemies are almost identical... one that jumps on you and pins you, one that grabs a player and drags them away, one that throws poison clouds, and one that's a giant death melee machine.  There are a few more specials like the gunner that mows you down at range, which is a nice change-up.  But really the biggest difference between this game and L4D is the loot system.  In L4D you get weapons as you play in each level.  In this one you pick your weapons going in, and you stick with them for the map.  But, you get new gear as you play and can upgrade that gear.  It's L4D with a loot and experience system.  XP doesn't unlock abilities or anything, it just unlocks a couple more trinket slots as far as I can tell.  But then I don't have a trinket for my starting slot...\n\nIf you liked Left 4 Dead, you'll like this game.  All the same strategies and tactics apply.  Unfortunately, that also means just like in L4D bots are nearly worthless and human players that go rambo charging in will only hurt your team.  But overall, quite fun with a competent team of players.","November 28, 2015","true","29.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Even if you (murder) can beat them because you have tactic, remember that soon you can drown uder thousand small screaming murderous rats. The game is full of murderous surprises.\nOnce you will finish mission you will get loot, in other words - murderous weapons, trinkets, guns or less murderous but very rare hats. Several hats have spikes so maybe you can use them to murder rats as well. Items are balanced because even if you roll better tier it will not give you massive advantage but only better chance to survive or will add a percentage chance to use special (murderous) affix.\nIn this game you can really feel the atmosphere of warhammer - dismembered bodies, impaled bodies, blood, overall gore, the combat is really good and characters are well designed.\n\nThe game is not recommended for kids under three years of life.","December 17, 2015","true","82.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

It's l4d2 but you know much better. It's basically l4d with rats and better graphics. This game has much more to do in it than l4d does. I'm finding myself torn between which one I like better, and so far this one is winning. I love games with RNG, also hate them but, that's love right? This game has like 6 raritys it goes white-green-blue-purple(cosmetic)-orange-red. I still have yet to aquire a weapon of orange or red rarity. What they did with the Tomes and Grimiores was amazing.. it gives you a side objective to look for while doing the level. (although not all of the levels have these) I do enjoy playing the different difficulties of gamemodes, although.. cataclysm is like slamming your head against a brick wall over and over again until you beat it. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING GRIMIORES AND TOMES ON LOWER DIFFICULTIES THAN HARD! Although most of the time I get them on hard.. lol. Overall this game has given me a great time! Most of the people I meet on there are nice and they will help me get better. Although there are those people who like to ♥♥♥♥ with you, so I recommend this game to anyone and everyone! It's allot of fun!","January 26","true","23.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Seriously there's a 1-to-1 mapping for the L4D specials to Vermintide. I can understand wanting to pay tribute but it's just unapologetic at times.\n..............................\n- the loot system. This is what keeps the game from being nearly as played in my group. You only get to roll for one piece of loot at the end of the mission, so if you gathered tomes and dice to enhance your rolls on loot, it's all for naught if you die. This is pretty harsh considering the times it can take to complete some of these missions. Even if you do things perfectly you may just be rewarded with yet another common item for a class you never use. If the loot system was updated to be more frequent or dropped more per mission, then I'd say this is a game worth placing a lot of hours into. As it stands my group has cleared all the missions at least once and, seeing the shlog in front of us that is this terribly long grinding, I doubt we're going to continue. This absolutely SUCKS considering how great the game is.\n..............................\n\nThis is a weird game to recommend. If you hate doing 20 minute missions just to get one item for most likely a class you don't play, you'll probably put this game down after 10~ hours. I mean if you love that grinding then yeah go for it. In short it's super fun but until they fix the terribly slow loot system I'll probably stop playing here.","February 22","true","9.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
