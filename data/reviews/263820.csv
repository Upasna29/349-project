As for the plot, it is amusing and it is nice to play as the villain for a change. It does get overly repeditive to always play the heroes in this sort of genre so I consider it a breath of fresh air overall.\n\nFor a mere 2 bucks, this game is one of the best deals for fans of the classic action/rpg's from the days of old.\n\nWell done, well done.\n\n","February 20, 2014","true","4.9"," 100 of 112 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","100","112","0","1"

If you like retro, you will like this, it stays true to the classics of old.\n3. Interesting story: you play as a ruthless, evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It has some funny moments but also some engagingly bleak ones, do not expect to be a good guy for one second.\n4. A final boss the way a final boss should be... beware.\n\nCons:\n1. Combat can sometimes feel repetitive, you may also feel like the only real challenge comes from bosses unless you are reckless.\n2. Game sometimes feels 'barebones' in respect to itemisation and some areas are repeated with different textures.\n\nTip:\nI recommend playing on hard from the start, I never tried normal but hard seemed just right.\n\nIn summary:\nBuy this game.

I'm sure this little nugget of info has been mentioned by many other reviewers, all the same it's worth mentioning.\n\nHomages are a mixed bag. This is how they usually end up: "Wow! This reminds me of my favorite game...except worse." Evil Quest isn't as good a game as Crystalis, but it's still okay. Evil Quest is about Galvis. What does he want to do tonight? He wants to destroy the world. He kills everyone that stands in his way, and even murders anyone that annoys him. Like any other villain, this guy also talks too dang much. While I can't imagine a mute evil-protagonist working out, by the end of the game I was sick to death of Galvis and his speeches.\n\nAs with most action-RPGs, Galvis starts with a pitiful knife and dirty rags, and his enemies are mere rats and low-ranking grunts. By the end of the game he's wielding the legendary chaos axe and slaying dragons & demons with no trouble. Getting to that point involves the typical town -> overworld -> dungeon progression. The dungeons are standard stuff, lots of respawning enemies, some treasure, sometimes a puzzle or two. It's nothing really involving, but I guess that's to be expected from a game that harkens back to simpler times.\n\nThe only bothersome aspect is that with every level-up, you're given points to distribute. Having stats for HP and DEF seems a bit superfluous, especially on hard difficulty where everyone hits like a truck. Boosting STR and MAG is more effective, mainly because the faster you can kill something, the less chance they have of damaging you. Plus if you want all the achievements you have to focus on two attributes (this will take two play-throughs), because the level-cap will keep you from maxing out all four.\n\nThis game can be really easy, with much of the difficulty being player-imposed. By this I mean you have things on harder on yourself (don't buy healing spells, don't use potions, etc) to remain challenged. However, the final bosses have some cheap attacks that are nearly impossible to dodge, so it's probably not the best idea. A sequel is in the works so the issues involving difficulty should get ironed out.\n\nWhat I'd really like to see out of the sequel to Evil Quest is A) better art-direction B) better plot C) a more involving quest. An old-school bum like myself probably shouldn't care about A or B but they along with C are why I consider Crystalis the better game (well, all that and better difficulty balance). Evil Quest was originally an Xbox Live Indie Game and it shows. The sprite-work is serviceable but not in any way unique, and just looks really banal.\n\nC gets it's own paragraph because it's the most important of the three. A good quest isn't just finding powerful weapons and killing massive enemies. Crystalis gets a lot of credit for changing things up beyond "kill monsters & get money". In one area you could ride around on a dolphin, there was a town run entirely by women, and you had to use a metamorphis spell to talk to their queen, there was also a zombie-infested town, and so on. In a lot of ways Evil Quest is too similar to traditional action-RPGs, which results in missed opportunities.\n\nThere aren't many games where you play somebody who is actually evil. It seems like there would be a lot of cool methods to progress the plot, like using sabotage, threats, murder, etc. Take Kefka from FF6 for example, imagine playing as him. At one point you poison the kingdom of Doma, later on you assist the emperor in fooling the resistance, then not long after that stab the Emperor in the back and take all of the god-like power for yourself. The rest of the game could be spent trying to stay one step ahead of the heroes, slowly picking them off one by one (or in parties).\n\nAll that said, it's not really a huge deal. As a homage throwback whateveryoucallit title, Evil Quest is solid. It has the basics down, and a sequel could turn out to be pretty spectacular with enough creativity injected into it.","October 27, 2014","true","10.6"," 39 of 42 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","39","42","0","0"

Now to the game, ill drop it in sections to make it easier.\n\nGameplay:\nI was very surprised, im normally not a fan of these kinds of games but the combat was very precise and quick, a easy to do hard to master kind of deal. The RPG side of it i was confronted was oddly simple yet deep enough for me to quickly realise the difference in how i could build a character, it allowed me from the start to know what i wanted to build and how to play with next to no hand holding, i was impressed. Just to squeeze in something i also enjoyed, the boss battles, they actually had mechanics to them that wasnt just walking around and dodging, it added a little more difficulty to the battles and made them more interesting.\n\nStory:\nThe story was quite intriguing, you play the opposite side of the way these storys would normally go, from the evil perspective and how overwhelming that evil is, i actually had alot of fun playing from this side. The story itself is nothing to special but interesting enough to carry you along the path of becoming stronger and beating bosses.\n\nSound:\nIts sound was not terrible but i admit i kinda got sick of it half way through the game, but it is fitting with the game and i enjoyed it up to that point, its kinda a mix of dark upbeat, very much suits the mood of the game.\n\nConclusion:\nIm very happy with this purchase, even at this price point, it delivered on everything i expected and didnt expect, this is a gem for the price that it is set for, and if your into these kinds of games and looking to kill a little bit of time, definantly dont skip over this.","December 6, 2015","true","10.3"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

It's a nice change to play as the bad guy and want to take over and destroy the world for once. This classic SNES type RPG game did everything right for me. It doesn't take itself too seriously, I mean, c'mon,  you have to kill God....\n\nTowards the end of the game, I pretty much ripped through any enemies in one shot, you can collect some pretty overpowered spells, and if you are like me, and stacked Intellect to get a higher mana pool, you could simply AOE through most zones, mopping up the experiance as you went.\n\nThe game is actually pretty simple. As long as you read the story, you won't find yourself wondering where to go next as it is quite clearly set out for you. There isn't any side quests to complete, however there are a number of achivements you work towards.\n\nI would highly recommend this game if you are looking for something a little different and only want to spend £1,60, you can't go wrong with this five hour long title.","November 20, 2014","true","4.6"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","20","31","0","0"

He was to weak so he got captured, in his jail he met an old-thief who tells him there is a place where he can find the ultimate wapon named "the secret power of the four legendary seals (The Astral Realm)".\nThe goal of the game is for Galvis to take revenge on his captors as well as unlock the secret power of four legendary seals.\nYou start the game in the jail where you kill a soldier wo wants to kill you, because you murderd his family, you have to explore the map, have to go trough sewers to get your ancient weapon named "the Chaos Axe" back and then you must fight against a little army of soldiers to get your armor back, now your objective is to kill the King who captured you, but on your way to his room, you must fight his right hand, a huge and strong soldier. after you defeatde him, he blocks the way so you have to go trough the sewers, when you get out of the sewers you traveld to a little village and that's where it al starts.\n\nOverview\nEvilQuest features a wide variety of environments, enemies, and boss creatures – all created in retro style with relax music, good animation and music.

Cure-3 makes every boss fight completely trivial in that you don't have to dodge all that many things, which should be the whole point of the battle. Personal discipline in not abusing overpowered mechanics can net a lot more enjoyment out of this game.\n\nThe level up system was also fairly lackluster in that it really feels like an unnecessary feature - the HP stat is statistically garbage, the magic stat can be abused to be overpowered.\n\nThose complaints aside, it's a solidly assembled title that works, for its price of $2. If the price were much higher, I'd have probably marked this as a negative review, but $2 is enough to let some non-game-destroying flaws slide, for a game that can offer a decent challenge with mostly working mechanics.","October 13, 2014","true","4.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The main draw of the game is how over-the-top the protagonist is.  It's not uncommon for you to learn spells and get equipment by threatening some NPC and then after getting said upgrade, to kill them.  The entire game is played out in this tongue-in-cheek manner and I found it amusing enough, though some will no doubt find it to be a bit try hard.\n\nThe artstyle is crude and bland at times and dungeons are a bit long and boring to traverse, but the dungeons have save points so replaying long stretches of them shouldn't be much of a factor.  Puzzles are rare and quite simple when they show up.\n\nThe best aspect of Evil Quest gameplay-wise is how easy it is to become a walking flamethrower.  Magic regenerates over time, so if you level-up and make it a point to pump intelligence, by the halfway point of the game you can constantly spam spells as you walk around and it trivializes most enemies.  I don't find this a downpoint since combat is rather simplistic and mowing down enemies with various spells is fun enough.\n\nThe game is pretty short, you probably won't end up with more than a half-dozen hours at most on a playthrough, though that's about right and it ended just as I was tiring of it a bit.

A short adventure worth the cheap price.\n\nThis game is extremely cheap and the premise of playing as a villan is intresting enough, but it's not executed well. The story is a revenge plot about a Dark Knight who is bent on taking over the country, and eventually the world. The dialouge is basic, but you'll probably laugh at how hard the writers tried to make your character "BADASS and RUTHLESS" As far as story is concerned, the game isn't too gripping. It's all about the gameplay here, which was a rollercoaster of good and bad core mechanics. You run around the world killing monsters to level up and collect eqipment and spells. The freedom to be more spell or melee focused is satisfying and well appreciated. Your melee attacks can be enhanced with a charge that turns it into a projectile that deals much more damage. Spells are split up into magical categories and the rate at which they are required is steady and unlocking the next magicical ability is genuinely exciting. The combat is engaging and the bosses are designed to accomodate your large arsenal of skills. On the other hand, the normal enemies are laughable and can easily be killed with continous shots from your sword. The pixelated graphics have moderate details, matching 16-bit era games, but the illustrations used for the cutscenes are unsettling to look at. there is something about the style that I just don't find appealing. The music usually fits the mood with a couple of stand-out tracks(The field theme). If you like action RPG's or the game crystalis go ahead and buy the game. it provides a decent 6-9 hours of gameplay and is fairly harmless when you consider it's EXTEREMELY cheap price.","October 6, 2014","true","7.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I played on Normal, and won the game in only a few hours, and only died once. I'm an RPG veteran, though, so it may provide a greater challenge and maybe an extra hour or two if you aren't as familiar with this type of game.\n\nPlaying the bad guy is... kinda corny, honestly. The main difference is that you fight a bunch of "good" guys and that you backstab almost everyone after they help you. The story is eh, but it doesn't get in the way of the action, so it could be worse.\n\nOverall, EvilQuest is a great buy. At such a low price, it's hard not to recommend it.","February 22, 2014","true","4.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game reminded me most of Crystalis on the NES, though it also has some similarities to Lagoon on the SNES. The map designs are similar as are some mechanics (jump boots.) Early on, the combat is fairly easy, though you may fail if you attack recklessly. Positioning and timing are most important for success, but, unlike the earlier action-adventure RPGs, enemies appear to have predictable cooldowns on their projectiles and abilities, making it far less likely you'll get surprised.\n\nThe controls are responsive, however you can perform only one action at a time like in the older games previously mentioned. The one thing that sets it apart is that you can move and turn your character while attacking, allowing you to control quarter- or half-circle sweeps with your weapon; otherwise, every attack is a forward jab. Opponents can do this also, which can catch you off-guard when flanking a foe.\n\nWhile formulaic, it's a tried-and-true recipe. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the genre and art style.","December 24, 2014","true","5.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

You can also set certain  items for a quick slot of easy use during heated battles.  Also, most battles are a challenge without being cheap.  Never do you feel the need to grind to beat the boss because if you just kill the enemies you see on the way, you will be fine.  But money will be an issue when you want (and need) certain spells and armor.  The Cure spells are a MUST!  But most of the important attack spells are given to you.

Story wise the big difference is this time rather than trying to stop the generic EVIL bad guy bent on world domination you play as the EVIL bad guy bent on world domination.  The story is fine and the EVIL twist makes it all feel fresh even though its about as simple as a RPG story gets.\n\nThe gameplay consists of attacking enemies with swords and such, holding down the attack button for a projectile attack, and some different magic attacks that you can find while exploring, or buy if you save up enough gold.  There are plenty of armor pieces to find to make you stronger, and accessories that make you more powerful in various ways, even a cape that makes you invisible.\n\nThe graphics look good for a 16 bit style, some of the enemies are merely reskined as you progress in the game, but others like dragons and ghost make for a nice visual treat as you make your way thru the game.  The levels are all based on elements like fire and water and look and play nice enough with just enough exploration to give the game some meat.  My only complaint is enemies respawn after you slightly move away from an area, so you can't clear a level per say, the enemies are always respawning.  This dose give you plenty of opportunity to gain exp points and level up, but as the game wares on it all gets a bit repetitive, but at about 5 hrs for a diligent explorer EvilQuest isn’t long enough for this to become a problem.\n\nOverall EvilQuest is a very fun ARPG that lets you experience the generic RPG story of those 90ies RPG's from the eyes of the bad guy and plays like a dream.  For the cost of less than a gallon of gas (in the US at least) this game is an absolute steel and should be played by anyone who likes Zelda like ARPG's or wants to be EVIL.","March 1, 2014","true","7.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

It comes off as something like a late NES or early SNES/Genesis title... if that perspective helps. You are a very powerful, evil dude that gets betrayed by his army and locked up. However, you escape captivity and go on a quest to regain your mighty power and ultimately seek to destroy God himself. Sounds pretty cool, right?\n\nYou basically go around overworlds seeking towns and dungeons. You can do some generally mean things along the way, but you're focus is to find four elemental things and then go to the final area once the barrier is broken. It's some standard, by the books stuff. But it works. Along the way, you fight through monsters and bosses in a Zelda-esque fashion. Defeating them will net you gold, which can be used to purchase equipment to make yourself stronger and items to recover from loss of health, loss of magic, or status ailments. As you progress, you'll find stronger weapons and different spells to help you tackle your foes. Also gained from defeated enemies are experience points. Getting enough of these will allow you to level up. Upon gaining a level, you have the option to distribute a number of points into whichever stats you see fit. This can be fun for building a specific way for different playthroughs. Want to beef up your magic skills? Maybe you want to deal mighty blows with your weapons. Or perhaps you just want to be a well rounded warrior. It's nice for some customization and replay value, yet not too complicated as to overwhelm the player. I also would like to point out that I thought the music was alright, but I do enjoy the art style quite a bit. Guess I'm a softy for that kind of thing.\n\nHowever, every game has its faults, as does EvilQuest. I can't complain too much with the main character being bad, as it is not often done still and keeps things a bit interesting. I guess I just wish they had maybe gone a little further with that idea. Maybe that's just me. My biggest complain comes from some expectations that were built up a bit and never capitalized on. Near the start of the game you get the charge ability, letting you shoot a projectile from your weapon at no cost to magic. You then use this to hit a switch through a wall and open a gate. A little while later is a switch puzzle, where some need to be up and some need to be down. Ithought this would mean there would be cool puzzle elements throughout the game like in Zelda games. However, there weren't much more like that to be found. I guess I was hoping it'd break up some of the grinding and killing, but I guess I didn't need to grind so that part was my own fault. My most minor and rather meaningless complaint is that, in order to get all the achievements, you have to play the game twice. Yet there seems to be only one achievement that absolutely forces you to do it. The one based on difficulty. If you play on normal, you have to beat it again on hard. Also, if you play it on easy, you'll get no achievement, which doesn't make much sense. But it's all in the achievements so it's really not even an issue with the game itself. Hardly worth mentioning but... I did. So... sorry.\n\nIt's a cool retro-inspired action adventure RPG. If you like Zelda games and the RPG leveling stuff, give it a look. The game is only two bucks normally, and even less when it goes on sale. It's very much worth the price. This could possibly have passed for a ten dollar game, five at the least. But the fact that it's only two bucks makes it hard to pass up. Sure, it could use some more stuff in it, but the things included are good, especially for that asking price. So go ahead and get your copy. Forget the hesitation and go for it.\n\nEvilQuest gets a 6/10. Everything is solid. It may not be the longest, most fleshed out, or most impressive, but what it does offer is quite a good experience and well worth the price.","January 7, 2015","true","28.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It reminds of that NES game Crystalis... even the overworld music pays a small homage by remixing it a bit... they didn't think I'd notice. :P It's a bit of a twist on the old cliche tale of good vs. evil as you're basically playing as the bad guy in this game and everything and everyone is trying to stop you from taking over the world... but you're the hero so that's not going to happen. :)\n\nVeteren's of the genre won't have much trouble completing it as it's a fairly straight forward, casual romp with a quest log to keep track of events as you progress. As long as you have some what of a decent memory for things, you shouldn't need any help... and trust me you're not going to get any... it's not the most popular game in the world atm. :P\n\nIt's a bit on the casual side for me though. I played it on the hard setting and used a caster build of straight magic / defense and that seemed to dominate the game quite easily. I guess if you're looking for more of a challenge, play a melee build instead. The game also allows for potion spamming so as long as you're stocked up, you really can't be defeated. Make sure to save your game every chance you get as well because the auto-saving is atrocious.\n\n6 / 10 decent.","February 21, 2014","true","5.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

EvilQuest is incredibly linear, you need to do the temples in a specific order, it won't even let you in to the temple before you have the required items. The temples are also linear, you keep going through a specific path until you get the item that lets you into the next dungeon.

The game plays like any other from the genre, with nothing really special to it. I did notice some rather clunky movement, especially from the enemies. They were a bit difficult to actually hit without taking damage yourself. You'll need to back up after every attack if you wish to kill an enemy. Some sort of knock back would have been appreciated.\n\nAlthough it may be generic, it's not to the point where I don't recommend it.","March 28, 2014","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Old School Action RPG by the numbers, with welcome features such as a run button and warp spell. The graphics look fantastic in window mode, but a bit fuzzy fullscreen. Controls are tight but enemy patterns can be unpredictable and frustrating at first.\n\nPersonally I found the plot interesting, there were a couple curve balls I didn't see coming either. Sound FX are on point, but the soundtrack itself is probably the weakest point. Kind of boring and sometimes even off tempo. Megadrive-esque chip music from a pro composer would have been more appropriate, but I appreciate the effort from the two-man team.\n\n8.5/10 overall.

It's a retro Action-Adventure RPG with memorable boss battles, a magic system that is reminiscent of the first Final Fantasy, a terribly evil main character (who is the most hate-filled protagonist since Kratos) and best of all it's a miniscule time/money investment. I loved the variety of locations, the pacing of advancement, and the story is dark with just the right amount of evil-villain cheesiness to top it off. The boss battles in particular were not only impressive in design, but one of the most exciting parts of the game.\n\nWhat I'm really trying to say here is that this is a great game and there should be more games like this. In the vast sea of indie games it's an easy one to overlook but you should give it the recognition it deserves. This game is $1.99 and is worth every penny.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/loveandpeace/recommended/263820/","loveandpeace","sigh of dog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/loveandpeace/","809 products in account","First of all, I had to think long and hard about whether to give this an overall thumbs-up or thumbs-down.  I finally concluded that since I put in the time to not only finish it but get all achievements, and for all its faults it was only made by two guys it seems so it's somewhat forgivable, that it had *just slimly* earned a thumbs-up.  That being said...\n\nWHAT THIS GAME IS:\n\nAn action-RPG straight from the NES era, very specifically based heavily on Crystalis to the point at which it's basically a poor man's copycat of that game in every way.  I would suggest skipping this and going to play Crystalis if you like the basic gameplay but want to waste as little time as possible, but if you love Crystalis and want more just like that you might as well give this game a try.  When all's said and done, the gameplay itself is actually quite fun with some fairly well-designed boss battles.\n\nWHAT THIS GAME IS NOT:\n\nDeep in any way, shape or form.  The artwork is laughable, the music is horrendous (some of the worst I've ever heard in any game, indie or not; do your ears a favor and turn it down on the main options screen before you even start your game) and the story is nonexistant.  Oh, sure, it has the barest-bones skeleton of what could have been a unique story, taking the role of a villain rather than a hero on a quest to destroy the world rather than save it, but the entire thing is presented in such a paltry manner it would be considered mind-numbingly boring and predictable even by 80s video game writing standards.  And if you're looking for some kind of character depth or heel-face turn or the actions of your character to mean anything beyond basic evil instincts, look elsewhere.  This game's all about being utterly and remorselessly evil, your character starts out as a more twisted take on a Saturday morning cartoon villain and only gets more evil from there.\n\nAside from the fact that I feel the art, music and writing are all inadequate even for an indie game made by two dudes, the attempts at humor fall short and there's a bit much killing and implied ♥♥♥♥ for a game that's meant to be a throwback to the simple, charming early era of Japanese RPGs.  Again, it teeters ever-so-closely to the edge of getting a thumbs-down; however, that basic element of gameplay is fun enough, especially for an action-RPG junkie like me, that it's the game's saving grace.\n\nThere are myriad ways in which this could have been done better, even with such a small team and null-budget; the most fitting comparison I can think of is Breath of Death VII, which is a similar type of NES RPG throwback that had a bit more competence put in the art, MUCH more care and attention put into the music, and writing that doesn't nearly mar the experience with the mentality of a 14-year-old boy who draws dudes getting disemboweled in his spare time; in fact, the follow-up to BoD, Cthulhu Saves the World, displays a much less clashingly unpleasant idea of a villain bent on world-destruction being the hero; it's played up in a much more over-the-top and cartoonish way that fits this style of game much more than the weirdly grisly and depressing 'evil guy' outlook deployed here.  But I'm getting off-track.\n\nBasically, its quality is sub-bargain-bin in almost every way, it's as deep as a dried-up puddle and it's quite short at that (over half my 'gameplay time' here is leaving the game on AFK, and that's with going through it twice for all achievements) but the basic elements of gameplay are so fun in a simple and straightforward kind of way that if you're into this kind of thing you'll probably find it worth the asking price, ideally if it's on sale.  The main point to take from this review is "these guys can and should do better next time, but they're on the right track".","December 10, 2014","true","26.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They are MIDIs. Oh wait, sorry. They're MP3s of MIDIs recorded using the default Windows soundfont. So you can't even use something like TiMIDIty++ or BassMidi to make them sound at least somewhat decent.\n\nThe next issue is the main character. The whole gimmick of the game is "play the villain". By villian, it means "horrible psychopathic murderer". Seriously, there is no depth to the character at all. No tragic backstory, just "let's destroy the world because why not". There is no motivation for playing as him. You don't root for the guy at all. He literally kills people for no reason.\n\nThe graphics are nothing special. Just your usual "retro 8-bit" fare. What you see is what you get.\n\nThe controls are horribly inconsistant, especially in the menus. Sometimes escape exits the menu, sometimes it doesn't. You press 'e' to open your equipment, but can't press 'e' again to close it. The in-game controls are also slightly unresponsive. It does mess you up slightly, but it isn't god awfully unplayable. Also, the best part about the controls is that you can see an enlarged view of the map by pressing 'm'. Except, you can't pause the game with the map up at the same time, making it almost useless.\n\nThe biggest flaw by far is the linearity of the game. There are no sidequests (I don't count achievements because they don't give you anything special in-game). There are also no real "transitions" to the different areas. You just wander around and beat dungeon after dungeon. This is probably why the game takes only around 2 or so hours to beat. There is next to zero real backtracking (which would be good if the game wasn't horrifically short). The only other real thing to go do is to get some hidden treasures (which really aren't that hidden).\n\nThe last thing of note is the uselessness of 90% of your items. Your charge shots can hit switches from far away. How many switches do you need to hit? One. The charge shot itself is also useless 90% of the time as well because you have to charge while standing still. The damage output isn't great either. The only real use is when you have to because the enemy is far away and you're waiting for your MP to regenerate. You later get the ability to jump. How many times do you need to jump? About twice. You later get running shoes, except you have to hold down alt of all things to use them. The uselessness expands to the towns as well. There are inns, but I have no idea what they do because I've never once needed to use one. The only thing you need from towns are potions. The armor you can get there you can usually get a few minutes of play later from a chest. Spells are next to useless to buy. You get most of them in game, and the ones you don't are obsolete or never really used. The major exception are the cure spells.\n\nAvoid forever","August 4, 2014","false","7.1"," 21 of 43 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","21","43","0","0"

The gameplay is pretty much hack and slash, with the ability of casting spells and charging your melee attack, making it a  powerful ranged shot. Trading cards are available and achievements are not hard to obtain, but may require a bit of grinding.

(So pictures that are hand made)\n\nThere are Save stations in the game, You are able to save there. However you can load the game at any point you want.\n\nYou are able to save if you are outdoors (So not in village/dungeon/whatevr)\nThere is some Harsh language in the game.\nThere is a Quest journal in the game to help you remember things.\n\nThere is a monster log. (That tells you about their information, like how much XP, Gold, HP weakness, item drop etc).\n\nYou have a Mini-map in the corner, Things that you haven't seen or walked before will remain foggy.\n\nMonsters spawn on spawn locations even if you were there 10 seconds ago. But you have to go offscreen on that spawn.\n\nSome Animations look sort of Dull/Lame?\nThe name of the spells are super creative. "ice1, ice2, fire1, fire2" and so go on. Not lazy at all...\n\nCombat/Level System\nCombat is NOT turned based and you can walk/fight on the same time.\nSome spells are able to hit enemies through the wall.\nMana pool will be slowly recharged/refilled by itself.\n\nThere is a level sytem in the game and if you level up, you get 2 Skillpoints to spend (more points the higher you will be). Your health will also be fully restored.\nBut you can only place 2 points MAX in a stat until you level up again.\n\nI Don't really think skilling the Vitality stat is worth it. It is only giving you 1 extra HP more. Intelligence is sort of ok, because you do more magic damage.\n\n\n\nStrenght -> Increases damage.\nToughness -> Increases Defense\nVitality -> Increases Health Pool.\nIntelligence -> Increase Mana pool and Magic Damage.\n\nYou are forced to spend points and can not save this for later purposes.\n\n\nOther things.\nYou are able to get the money drops on locations that you can't walk too. Use the attack button to get them. (This only works if they are nearby ofcourse).\n\nIf you need to farm a certain monster and you know where his spawn location is. Kill it and let his spawn location go offscreen. Then walk back to the monster and he is respawned.\n\nMake sure you do not forget to save at save stations, You have to do this manually and will not be automatically be done. (Which could be confusing if you hear the sound after you have stepped on a station)\n\nI will give this game 6/10","December 8, 2015","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eidolancer/recommended/263820/","eidolancer","Doc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eidolancer/","151 products in account","Evil Quest isn't terrible. But that's really all there is to say. It's playable if you like top-down action RPGs. The combat isn't inspired, and the hitboxes take some getting used to (it's bigger than it looks on your sprite). Attacking is a bit tedious, and magic, especially early on, consumes so much of your meter and takes so long to recharge that you'll find yourself using the first spell, Ice 1, through most of the game, just because it's cheaper to cast. Heal 3 makes the game trivially easy. Once you get that (you can get it just before the ice dungeon), you can almost instantly heal up from any attacks, and unless you get overwhelmed by a rapid assault, nothing will kill you. The final boss can be defeated by standing still and spamming projectiles and healing, even in the hardest difficulty. Hard difficulty is barely that. The only difference is that enemies have tons more health and do a little more damage, meaning fights take longer and you have to heal more often.\nThe characters are one-note and repetative. Your main character has only one mood, angry, and he will resort to murder for virtually every situation. Even some potential allies wind up being killed for essentially no reason. The main character's motivation is nothing more complex than "destroy the world". So yes, in that it features a quest of an evil character, this is an evil quest. However, that is all it is. The other NPCs come in two types: "I will kill you, you monster!" and "Please don't murder me, Mr. Bad Guy!". You will always kill the first type, and usually kill the second type. That's it. There is nothing more interesting to the plot.\nIf you can get this game on some crazy sale, you may as well, if you wanna kill a few hours. I got it for about a dollar. If you can't get it for less than 3 bucks, don't bother, because you won't get much back.","November 18, 2014","false","12.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Additionally the equipment screen is E while the rest of the menus are on Escape. The tutorial mentions the mouse controls, and they, at least, seem sane.\n\nThe Ugly: Save points.

It's a terrible veneer of a game that doesn't even properly cover the systems that it's built on top of.\n\nIgnoring the story, this game is just baby's first XBLIG that somehow got on Steam just like a bad Minecraft clone would.  While it doesn't cost much money, I still don't think it's worth the cost in time.

It IS, however, a fun action RPG that offers a decent challenge with a surprising amount of flexibility in play style. It's everything you would expect from an intentionally retro-style game. The graphics and music bring up those good old nostalgic feelings, but EvilQuest stands apart from similar games because of its dedication to its story. While most gamers may be tempted to overlook the story for its simplicity, I found it to be wholly satisfying.\n\nWithout spoiling too much, I'll say that EvilQuest's story trashes the Good VS Evil in favor of an Evil VS All approach, and it works really well. I found myself caring about what happens next and who the protagonist would encounter. Think about that.

It's not perfect but it does satisfy the fun I had playing the old 16 and 8 bit games of this nature. Also you get to play from the bad guy's perspective. Too many times games that take this route either wimp out and either A: make you really a misunderstood good guy or B: make your enemies even worse then you are. EvilQuest does neither, you're just straight up evil. That being said the rest of the writing is a bit off. It seems at times that the game isn't sure whether it's tounge in cheek or deathly serious. You'll have some humourous dialouge in one scene that's way over the top and in the next be talking to someone whose family was murdered and ♥♥♥♥♥. It can be off putting to say the least.\nGameplay also has its ups and downs. Everything controls very well and the spells in the game are very satisfying to use but they also bring up one of the other downsides. The spells are extremely overpowered. Seriously just dump your points in intelligence and you can whip through this game even on hard. While this is a downside I can't deny there being a certain perverse glee in wiping out a whole screen of enemies and eating the bosses for lunch half-way through the game.\nThe one thing that really bothers me though are some of the enemies (mostly the bosses) hitboxes. This ones kind of hard to explain but it's the worst on the first boss a giant knight. I was standing behind him but for some reason his helmet was hitting me and killing me because the game thought I was touching him. This problem occurs in a few other bosses and considering that this wasn't a problem in actual SNES titles it's a bit unforgiveable here. In fact I almost quit right there but I am glad I didn't as the game is much better then its opening dungeon would suggest.\nAll in all give this one a try. Despite its downfalls it is still one of the better "retro style" games out there in a sea of similair games that are much worse. Cheers, I hope this review was useful.","April 14, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As many of the reviews have pointed out, it draws a lot of inspiration from Crystalis on the NES. And as an action-RPG, EvilQuest is competent and has some depth to the fighting mechanics. There are quite a few areas to explore and the story is pretty standard for a JRPG.\n\nBut the writing, overall plot, and execution are lacking and need refinement or maybe someone more experienced in those areas. The game starts off with a bit of humor, but then half-way through loses that and the potential for some comedic moments.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cliff_utubius/recommended/263820/","Cliff_utubius","Cliff","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cliff_utubius/","209 products in account","I recommend this game, mainly because of the price. If not for that, it wouldn't be worth owning. EvilQuest, is not the kind of game that is fresh, or new. Many of the retro styled games at least try to advance on old ideas; whereas this one is a blatant copy of one of my favorite titles, Crystalis. The charging of your weapon, to the layout of the overworld. There is however a refreshing feeling I have, when playing it. It may be a copy, but it is done quite well. Sure, one could argue, that the sprite design is poor, and cheesily bad. But then again look at LJN; they were charging full game price, and most of their games were hardly playable. One area 'EvilQuest' tries to advance, is the story. Now, back in the old times of NES, and SNES, we were always forced to play as the 'Hero'. This was the way things were; and it worked, damn well, at that. This was the golden age; the stories were good, the gameplay was majorly addicting, and the sprites were done so well, that we could literally see them pop off the screen. Evilquest does some of these things right. But I digress. The story is one area where they advanced, as we get to play as the villian, for once. You start out as a reknowned antagonist named, Galvis. He is all sorts of evil badassery. We are only told this through the title, game trailer, and some of the dialogue. Thus, it is the weakest point in the game. When all you are killing is monsters in the overworld; how can you call your game, EvilQuest? Seriously, this is my only real annoyance. 6/10 Great price, somewhat good title.","March 5, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not a bad little game, wish it was a little longer and a little better in the dialogue department.  I see other reviews complaining about the hitboxes and other issues but it was certainly no worse than some of the first Zelda-ish type games we used to see. Now, is that a bad thing? Depends. I did not pay much for the game and for what I paid I can forgive a few missed hits here and there. It's better than I could make for sure and the story did make sense for the most part.\n\nAll in all I would recommend it if you are looking for a fun little game. It's simple, fun, and actually humorous in places. Is it perfect? No. But it is fun and worth the 4hrs spent.\n\nI'd like to see more and with a bit more complexity!","July 26, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can only use one magic spell at a time and in order to change it you have to go to the menu, this gets tedious and it would be more  convienient if it used number keys to use magic. The other thing is that although the story is not the same thing over and over the overall the story could have used more plot developments.

Sadly I sold my cartidge and game package but kept the manual.  Over time, from Ebay, I collected the missing pieces and have a complete Crystalis even with the ads from the package.  Now fast forward to Evilquest.  This game may not have been made by SNK but it sure as hell played, sounded, and graphically looked like Crystalis.  The only thing that differs really are the storyline and a few minor additions.  I absolutely loved this game!!! For 1.99 I bought this game and it was completely worth it.  I give it a 8 out of 10, as the cutscene cinemas were a bit choppy.  If you like trips down memory lane its more like 9 out of 10.

There are only two apparent problems with this game that I think worth mentioning. You can only use one magic spell at a time and in order to change it you have to go to the menu, this gets tedious and it would be more  convienient if it used number keys to use magic. The other thing is that although the story is not the same thing over and over the overall the story could have used more plot developments.

It's breath of fresh air. The story is simple. You are Galvis – dark knight, who wants to kill the good guys, take over the world and annihilate it. For that purpose, he needs the Chaos Axe, but it's protected by four seals and Galvis have to destroy them. This isn't oscar winning story and I don't consider it a bad thing. The guy wants to destroy the world – nice and simple.\n\nThe graphics are retro pixel art and you won't find much options here. Sliders for music, effects, difficulty setting, auto save, flash effects, fullscreen and resolution. 1280X720 pixel is the maximum here and this is the biggest issue. But I have one problem, but it might be isolated case. My PS2 controller is not compatible with the game. But mouse and keyboard setup works perfectly. And you can rebind keys.\n\nLike I said in the beginning, this ARPG. You can attack only in four directions and the starting weapon is a knife. Soon after you start the game you will gain the ability to charge a shot, by holding the attack button for a few seconds. This is essential for surviving. In addition to shooting enemies from a distance, this will help you push hard to reach levers. There are three charge levels. Longer you hold, more powerful will the shot be.\n\nAs the game progresses, you will find new weapons. They are connected with your quest. Every new weapon is more powerful than the old ones, so you don't need to use the previuos.\n\nIf the game have only weapons, I wouldn't recommend it. But fortunately, you can use magic. They are pretty standard – fire, lightning, ice, water and earth. Every spell have two levels and they differentiate in their animation and usefulness. My favorite is Earth 2. When you are in a tight place with multiple enemies, a giant rock start ricocheting in the walls and damage everyone in the process.. You learn the spells from certain people, but if you missed someone, you may be abble to buy some of the in the shops.\n\nThe level design is nothing special, pretty standard for old school game like this. But the environments are different – dungeons, volcano, grassfield and so on. While wandering, you will find villiges. There you will buy new gear, hearbs for restoring life, mana, antidotes, spells, sleeping, learning about places you have to visit, searchis houses and so on.\n\nMap exploration is recommened. Beside gaining xp by killing enemies, you will find treasure chests with money, herbs, gear and others. That way part of the money will be saved for something expensive.\n\nEnemies are also typical for the genre – ghosts, soldiers, lizard-like people, bats, rats and so on. A lot of them are just reskin of each other. What I mean is the attack pattern are the same. Of course, there are other with totally different attacks or combine two. The AI is basic, but it works. As a hole it's okay.\n\nEnemies constantly respawn, so you don't have to search for them to gain XP. After leveling up, you will receive different amount of points and you have to put them in 4  skills – strength, vitality, intelligence and toughness. You can't put more than 2  in one place. There is one thing I don't understand. What defines how much point I get? Sometimes I earn 4, other 2 and then 3. As far as the bosses, all I can say is they are ton of fun and you need different approach for each.\n\nSound design is good, it' on the level of older 16 bit games. Every sound of weapons, magic, the effects as a hole, remind me of them. The music is the one thing I don't like that much. It's just not memorable for me.\n\nI had a lot of fun and this fun cost only 2E or your regional equivalent. You'll get great game, especially if you are into Zelda-like games. It took me little more than 4 hours, although Steam says 7. The dev done a great job of recreating 16 bit game. It's almost perfectly polished for what it is, aside from the low resolution. I recommend it. There is EvilQuest 2 on the way and it looks better in every way. Can't wait to get my hands on it.","June 10, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is absolutely spot on with great combat, story, characters and general gameplay.\n\nCombat: While it is a simple swing your sword (or axe) type of game, it requires just enough timing that it isn't on the end of SUPER HARD OMG I CANT HIT ANYTHING or everything just keeps dying there's no challenge! With different enemies ranging from projectile shooting ones to just regular (easier) ones that only do damage when you touch them, it makes you learn the enemies. There's also magic with many different spells throughout and a charged projectile attack so make things easier on those annoying bosses.\n\nStory: It's a fairly straightforward story but provides an interesting direction to the game. Many of the conversations that Galvis has with other characters provides for interesting content and quite a bit of humor.\n\nCharacters: Aside from Galvis, the other people in towns provide information on direction in the storyline, just enough info that you'll have to pay attention but nothing overly detailed that's confusing so you can get right to the next part.\n\nGameplay: From herbs and potions to spells and weapons, there are quite a few items that can be bought and gathered to increase your stats (attack, defense, all that). The leveling up system in this is also spot on. There's never a time where things are too easy or too hard due to the perfect balance. Certainly bosses can be difficult (as are any enemies you don't understand yet) but once you get the pattern, it's just the right challenge for your level.\n\nOverall, great great game, easy to get into and well worth the price.","August 8, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I highly recommend this game. The art design, the writing, the skillset, the variety of enemy, the strict limits on empty spaces (no trudging barren fiels of nothing): all of it, very, very good.\n\nThe only negatives I can think of? When I started investing points in magic, I was wiping the floor with bosses, and on the hard difficulty level, bosses were wiping the floor with me (before much magic - I didn't get any further).

I still own the cartridge, in fact. For decades I have wanted more of that game, be it a sequel or, as is the case in EvilQuest, a 'spiritual successor'. A mere two hours in, I feel confident in saying that this game delivers.\n\nEvilQuest takes Crystalis and ever-so-slightly modernizes it, like adding in a map, quest log, improving the menu functions, and allowing the player to customize the character when levelling up. What it does not do is add in unnecessary filters, particle effects, and bloom that would've been impossible in, say, 1990. It feels exactly like an early SNES or very late NES game, and is clearly made by a developer who loved his game.\n\nI have some slight disappointment in that there are no sort of puzzles in this game, just 'Do you have the McGuffin?" anti-sequence-breaking checkpoints; this was one of my few complaints against Crystalis as well. You wander through the world murdering everything that you can, scouring the land for all the plot coupons to unlock the next zones. Thankfully, this game is kind enough to shepherd you back towards a relevant area so you don't spend hours looking through irrelevant low-level areas for things you've missed. The art style in the cutscenes also leaves something to be desired, but certainly falls within acceptable tolerances for an indie developer.\n\nEven with its limitations in mind, EvilQuest only costs a pittance, so if you enjoy top-down action RPGs you should certainly give this game a try.","August 3, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
