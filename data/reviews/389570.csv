"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mothela/recommended/389570/","Mothela","Sharples","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mothela/","11 products in account","UPDATE: March 10th 2016.\n\nA copy-cat Agar.io remake with microtransations!\n\nOkay, I'm going to keep with review as short as I can, because there is already a better game out there that is totally free: Agar.io. This game is a re-make of that game with a different name called "Mitosis.\n\nFirst of all and let's get this out of the way; microtransations - What the hell were they thinking? I COMPLETELY understand  this in a game that YOU created and DIDN'T steal. But basically, you need to give them real life money.... for skins ALREADY CREATED for FREE on Agar.io. You can find these skins here: http://www.agarioguide.com/skins/ Why should we need to pay for free skins that are already out on another game? ALTHOUGH you do get money in-game that you can buy skins with (BUT THE MICROTRANSATIONS ARE STILL THERE. WHY?!) What is the use? It's cosmetic so it doesn't help you, this isn't really a pay to win game (as from me playing it). But god, clearly this was made for microtransations, otherwise there really wouldn't be no need to steal another game. I'm honestly disappointed with this re-make.\n\nUpdate: I can now confirm this is a pay to win game, as you can equip bonuses to make your cell split further, gain faster speed, better reflexes ect. Oh and you're going to need to be ready to give them money like cash cow Miniclip, because I saw the highest one was OVER 8000 COINS. You can get coins for free, YES but holy **** will that take you a long time to get 8000 coins. This will cost you $15.99 for 10000 coins, the next one below it is 4000 which will cost you $7.99 what a complete rip off and it doesn't even justify it for a pay to win bonus, it just makes IT WORSE.\n\nUpdate 2: Since I've played this game again I can confirm it's gotten worse with the pay to win scheme. Especially one bull-**** mechanic that completely turns the tide for the pay to win user. If you buy this, you've pretty much the game, it's ridiculous. What this does is a cell can stop another cell from moving. FROM *****ING MOVING. If you buy this, you're sure as hell going to be first every-time in this game because of how broken it is. Actually wait, it's not broken. It does it's job pretty well, BY SCREWING OVER EVERYONE IN THE GAME. It'll stop you for about three seconds, which is enough time to come over eat your parts (or split). I was once playing this game with this user who was about level 37 compared to my level 30 or so, and just as I was about to re-merge they use this extremely unfair mechanic, and of course as a result I died. I couldn't even W or Split more to get away. They're constantly adding new pay-to-win bonuses every-time which makes your experience in this game as a freebie so much worse.\n\nIt does have a leveling system, I don't know what this does yet, but I'm guessing it is like Agar.io Facebook where if you register on Agar.io via Facebook, you get more mass to start off with (depending on the level of course). I actually like this change, I like that you can see a leveling system on cells, in Agar.io you can't do this, but once again it feels like its been copied and pasted into an already copied and pasted game.\n\nNow as for the rest of the game, there really isn't much to complain about, ASIDE from the copy and paste game. So let's talk about some bad issues with the game: First off when you split your cell and try to re-combine, IT RECOMBINES EXTREMELY FAST (splitting cells with viruses is almost useless as recombing is 25 seconds at most. Even when you're big, I think there is little variation on how many seconds you re-combine with how big or small you are. Second is ACTUALLY recombing itself, okay this is INCREDIBLY difficult to do, this is mostly due to the speed of smaller cells compared to big cells, theres no system in where you can "join" two cells together, you need to find a wall to help you or try and stay still (which takes a long time). The third is the viruses, WAAAY too easy to split someone, you only need to eject mass three times in a virus to split it, compared to the 7 in Agar.io. Also, splitting someone with a virus is hard, it has camera issues and you can only eject mass from one of your cells, so if you're split, too bad you won't double it.\n\nI've tried three modes: FFA, Random Teams and Hunger Games. Random teams is... well it's teams alright I don't know WHY its called randoms teams, but both game mods are pretty much the same on Agar.io. In teams however your team needs to get one cell to 5000 mass to win. Which I'll admit I do like, I feel like this should be implemented into a different mode where there are two teaming mods so you can have one scoring mode and one infinite mode (where you play for some time). FFA is just.. well yeah it's free for all, you can do whatever you want. Hunger games is a direct rip off to the AgarioMods version. When they implement Hide and seek it will be based on AgarioMods as they're the founders of the idea. Yet again another mode stolen.\n\nThere is *SOME* anti-teaming penalty like Agar.io, teamers are STILL completly rampant in this game and the community is toxic, either asking to team or swearing at you a million times for killing them, I'm glad Agar.io doesn't have this chat mode though because basically it'd be the same thing. You will basically recieve a teaming fatigue that doesn't allow you to press "W" for a period of time. You don't actually lose a lot of mass like in Agar.io, it just stops you from W'ing for a small brief time.\n\nYou can upload your own skins, once again the idea is stolen from AgarioMods, which allows you to put your skin on FOR FREE (you need 200 coins, which to be fair isn't bad but I don't like the idea of having to pay for things that especially is on a stolen game :/). Also for some reason when you actually upload your owns skins they become extremely.... Well the pictures in-game are very bad. It's like a half loaded JPEG image.\n\nHumans vs Zombie? Stolen. AgarioMods.\n\nHunger Games? ♥♥♥♥ing again STOLEN from AgarioMods, god is it just me or do these developers have no innovation at all.\n\nSoccer mode? Okay I'll give you that one, I'm not sure what this is.\n\nYou can now create private rooms for you and your friends for 200 coins.\n\nAchivements that give coins? I'm all for this, good job on that one.\n\nYou can add your account in the game on Facebook for 100 coins.\n\nThis game has a sound-track. That's good! Especially when you're in full-screen. I kind of like the sound-track. Theres are different variations with them.\n\nI can't give this game a proper review because it's basically a copy and paste with microtransations. If you like this game; Then I suggest you try Agar.io. Trust me, you'll love it. But I'm not going to recommend this game. It's a steal with microtranstions, that alone makes it not recommended, no matter how good the game is, if it steals someones work, then it has no right to be anywhere else without the owners consent.","August 1, 2015","false","9.5"," 201 of 278 people (72%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","72","201","278","18","12"

I will start off with stating this game is nothing but a copied version of Agar.io. The dev thought how to make money, so he copied someone else's game, and added pay-to-win BS to a free-to-play Steam game. I will also add the dev most likely uses the excuse that"agario is a great game and really should be put on steam, so I went ahead and did that).\nSo I will first say that when I got in I realized quickly that it is just as frustrating as Agar.io. In fact, it is the same as Agar.io, with re-textured cells and a bunch of baloney currency system type crap, a stupid XP system, and much more which I will later state. I played for an hour, had a score of 1500, was 2nd on the scoreboard, and some goon came up, spit half of his mass into one of the virus thingies, and I got separated into 10 different ♥♥♥♥ING bits, to which every person around me began to feast upon me. Amazing how one person who just started can ruin your 1-hour thing you worked on.\nFor the experience that I have, I would say this game is not at all worth it. Why? Because this is a COMPLETE rip-off of a game you can play on the internet for free. Another reason is that once you play for a while, it counts your deaths and once you hit like 10 deaths or so, it forces you to buy the full version. Go with Agar.io, if you like this stuff. Do not support the devs, they ripped off a popular free-to-play web browser game, and they should be ashamed. They did not do anything new, they copied someone else's idea.\n\nEdit: ♥♥♥♥ THIS ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ GAME I HATE IT AND THE DEVELOPERS.

I checked most of the profiles for the reviews that claimed something along the lines "Copy of Agar.io" or “Ripping players off” or “Laggy af” and I can conclude that they haven't even played the game well enough to see the difference.\n\n1. Making Agar.Io a tree to branch off of is nothing illegal or outrageous. Do your research and you'll find that many of the very popular games take ideas from other games and make it better. It is nothing new.\n\n2. This game has so many feautures that Agar.io does not give to their players. CHAT BETWEEN PLAYERS, Guilds, Soccer mode, Hunger Games mode, Capture The Flag mode, Pets! and plenty more.\n\n3. (This is for the people complaining about how this game is a pay to win.) I'd like to point out that Agar.io recently sold out to Miniclip once they found that they can make money off of the players. Now, even in Agar.io, you can buy boosts like increased mass at spawn. If you're complaining about that feauture in this game being pay to win, then you can't say Agar.io is any better in those terms. Additionally, in both versions of the game, you can earn game coins by playing. Nobody is forcing you to pay for anything.\n\n4. THE LAG IS NOT REAL. Well... not too real, at least. It's the type of lag that can be looked over when you're too into the game. It's not the type of lag that will give you a disadvantage. (Unless you have a really really really bad computer.)\n\nIn my opinion, the creators of this game are very smart for what they did. They took a game like Agar.io, made the game style their root, and grew their own tree of wonder. It’s no surprise that there are jealous people who are going to dislike the genius minds.\n\nP.S. If you like the simplicity, I don't discriminate. Go play Agar.io if it makes you happier. :)\n\nP.S 2 By commenting about how unoriginal this game is, you are being unoriginal yourself.

However, it itself is a straight-up clone of another, near-identical game, Agar.io.\n\nIt is in this mindless consumption of your faceless equals that the game reflects not only itself and Freakinware, but every other attempt at cloning Agar.io. It consumes and absorbs everything Agar.io is, was, and will likely ever be, in a mindless bid to fuel it's own growth, and become the biggest fish in the pond. As it tries to devour and conquer, it is opposed by countless others vying for the exact same goal. Each as pitiless, remorseless, and fearless as itself, purely driven by the id. And yet, despite the goal of growth, no true growth or progress can ever be made. No matter how big one grows, they still continue to hunt the same objective, never satisfied, never accomplished.\n\nAs far as one may have physically grown, there is no mental development, no questions.

I was literally the only solo player in the game.  "join another lobby" you may suggest... Nope, no easy way to do that without quitting, waiting several minutes, and joining back up, otherwise it will put you straight back into the same lobby.  The level 69 players with no lives, no hobbies, no girlfriends, and too much money and nothing to spend it on have bought thousands of coins, which means they have the best powerups (these were a cool idea, but they've got to go), and dozens of the super glue potions (way overpowered), allowing them to instantly merge and devour the people they bait into coming too close under the pretense they might be able to gain some mass and bust up a team.  Then they instantly split to feed their gigantic teammate (we're talking 10-15,000 mass), to form ridiculously powerful teams.  They fill tne entire map.  If you like pay to win games where people don't speak your language, don't care about rules, and intentionally ruin your gameplay experience, then this is your jam.  Otherwise, don't bother.  Powerups became OP, teamers ruined FFA, North American servers populated almost entirely by spanish speakers from other countries, coins for powerups = pay to win, often very laggy, chat system actually makes it EASIER to for teams and/or harass other players, often empty or close to empty lobbies, games with only 10-15 people in them because the kids, teamers, and spanish speakers ran everyone off, kids EVERYWHERE, most of them think they're "pro" because they have a youtube channel with 3 subscribers, etc.  There really is just no redeeming quality about this game any more, other than busting up huge teams and feeding the rest of the server their mass.\n\n\nMy feelings on this game are mixed.  It's mostly fun, but just like with agar.io, teaming up in FFA has essentially ruined this game as well.  At any given time of day, the North American servers are filled with Brazilians and Argentinians feeding each other and multi-splitting, then intentionally popping themselves to engorge their teammates to form truly unbeatable, huge masses.\n\nIf the teamers would stick to the team servers, I'd say this game is 100% awesome, but as with everything, people have made the decision to ruin everyone else's gameplay experience.  If there were admins to boot people from the FFA servers for teaming up, then this game would be much better than agar.io, which has suffered a similar fate and will decay into irrelevancy.\n\nI'm going to tentatively recommend, because it is a fun experience a little over half the time.  Do something about the teamups in FFA and you've got yourself a winner.","April 11","false","42.6"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/azurelinctus/recommended/389570/","azurelinctus","Azurelinctus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/azurelinctus/","306 products in account","I just started this game a few weeks ago and immediatly enjoyed it at the time, I started playing Agar.io and then found out this similar game on Steam the same day so switched to that. The game is really quite fun when you are having success and still fun even though you loose fairly to someone (this is where I get to my but), but for the most part gameplay is not fair because of cheaters.\n\nMitos.is has people teaming in FFA and people making their own teams in Team Mode. For example your playing as red and you approach someone in yellow, they are half your size so you split on them, allowing you to then bring your both halves back on top of them to eat. These tricks work awesome and its fun if not for the more then often times that your fellow team mate in red who has decided to "Team" with the yellow guy you are about to eat comes out of no where, feeds most of his mass to the yellow guy and you are immediatly gulped in the blink of an eye.\n\nAnother one I love (sarcasm) is when you are split in 2 and each half is less than the size of a person in and apossing team converging on you, you have time to rejoin but then thwated because a "team mate", yet again, decided to cross team with the one about to eat you. Your "Team Mate" is small so he wedges himself between you and no matter what direction you take you can not rid this nasty little turd, finaly you get eaten by the other guy due to your so called "Team Mate's" help.\n\nI love it also (sarcasm again) when your team mates pop you as your being chased by someone of the opposing team because, he is colour blind? No, wrong, he is working for the other team and has other plans for the way the game is played. Well I have had enough for now.\n\nAll of what I mentioned happens far too often, you will have fun and I have won at count 7 games, reaching 5k mass in "Team Mode" in the 27 hours I have played, however at least 90% of the games I have played have had "Teamers" in them, asking chat "Team?" "Team?" "Team?" like some squaking bird. I have been just on the verge of winning in a few games only to be shafted by a "Team Mate" working for another colour.\n\nPerhaps the cross teamers have no skill? must be the situation because they constantly beg for help from someone else and don't bother to play the game through their own skill, relying on someone else like a personal who...(Slave), so they are nothing more than working class girls lending out their services for xp to level up.\n\nI will be giving this game a negative score, although I will change it back when or if the devs do something to fix this. The devs should either implement a reporting system and actively review it or appoint mods in game.","January 23","false","159.2"," 63 of 113 people (56%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","56","63","113","10","2"

Turcotte\n\nI apologize in advance; it has been long overdue since my last review. I thought the review would be appropriate to strike back and return with. Now, I have played agar.io and in my opinion it is excellent. I was told of Mitos.is from a friend and told it’s not that bad and since it’s free why not.  First impression was negative. I opened the game and realized that I was displayed on the screen as Player162733 or something like that was immediately thought that I was signed off of Steam or something, but no I had to create an account for no apparent reason. Thinking over that there are some benefits, if I travel and want to play Mitos.is at a friend’s house all I have to do is sign in within the game. *no hassle.  Another thing I thought was bazar was the armour, powers, shield etc. In the game store. I had played a game of FFA and was shot with a spider web or something and I couldn’t move and an enemy ate me. Again, I was confused and wondering what the heck! It is a huge turn off for gamers when you realize you have to start from the bottom like that. There are also loads of other things that bug me about the game but I won't dive into it today. For example the whole coin thing bugs me. Unfair matchmaking makes this game frustrating for new players. It's quite stupid when an enemy can simply stun you and casually float up to eat you while you have nothing to counter with.\n\nAnyway, my final thoughts is mixed I don’t hate the game in fact I think I’m gonna keep playing it, I just don’t like the whole concept. Remember Agar.io?… that was a good game. Wait, dose Agar.io and Mitos.is relate somehow. No, probably not. (Sarcasm)\n\n–Raymond K.

TL;DR is at the bottom.\n\nComparing It to Agar.io\nYes, it's an Agar.io rip-off, but it has added features. It's much more responsive, detailed, interesting, and comes with default music and sound effects. The principle of Mitos.is is exactly the same to Agar.io, but like I said, they've spiced it up a little bit.\n\nWhat's Added/New to It?\nHere I'll go more in-depth.\n\nIt's more responsive. A hell of a lot more. Agar.io revolves around you getting lucky whether the website would actually detect your mouses' location or not, and Mitos.is fixes that. It's so much easier to squeeze yourself out of sticky situations and catch people out.\n\nThey've kept the skins. But you have to level up to earn them. I'm not too sure what I think of that. On Agar.io, it's nice to be able to just pick your skin and boom, there you have it, and Mitos.is lacks that. But at the same time, isn't it nice to wear a skin that you've earned?\n\nSound Effects and Music. That's what Agar.io really, really lacked. Yes, sure, you can download mods for it and all, but why not have it there anyway without some tacky browser add-on? Lovely, isn't it?\nMitos.is' music is also 10x better than the Agar.io modded ones. Bleugh.\n\nTL;DR ~ It's Agar.io with better graphics and motion control with ranking, leaderboards, leveling up, music and sound effects.\n7/10\n\nEDIT\nWell. I have to pay to continue?\n3/10.","July 29, 2015","false","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Original review follows:\n\nYes, it's a ripoff.\n\nI loved Agar.io when it first came out, but then I inexplicably started having lag problems that made it unplayable. I don't know if it was on my end, or due to more people playing, or due to a change in Agar.io's code, but I literally couldn't play it anymore.\n\nI don't have lag playing this.\n\nAdd to that Steam's framework, global leaderboards, more options for customizing my blob, and general polish, and this is the superior game.\n\nIs it a dirty clone of something original? Yes. Is it better in every way? No. But this game takes everything I loved about Agar.io, and adds to it.\n\nFinally, if the Agar.io dev had made different choices, this game wouldn't exist. It fills a void that Agar.io couldn't. And that, in my opinion, earns a recommendation.","July 29, 2015","false","1.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game is definitely more varied and fair than agar.io, so I agree with the many people liking the game more than agar.io. However, there is not really any formal introduction to the game and what is available, so I was not sure at first what gamemode to try or what this "equipment" system actually was. I have not played long enough to understand the equipment system, but I feel that could be a formal introduction. Although it is a fairly good game, it is not a particularly fun game, and definitely not something that I would take time out of my day to play, considering other games in my library are just more enjoyable overall. It would be good on mobile (I think it is available), and you might like it if you have nothing else to play or just want to find something new when you are bored of other games after playing them for so long, but it really is not something that I would continue playing to get a higher level, more equipment, achievements, etc. I would not want to invest -- or "get gud" -- at this game because I do not see a reason to acquire any experience, etc. I think it is a nice play on agar.io, with many different gamemodes -- possibly fun with friends -- but not worth playing to level up or playing it like an MMO.","May 29","false","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Rubik's made the original cube, but then other companies came along and made it BETTER. This is the same way. Agar.io is the original game, but Freakinware Studios came and made mitos.is, which is basically agar.io but with way more features. And by "more features", I mean, a lot of new features. They added new gamemodes like Humans vs Zombies, Soccer Mode, Capture The Flag, and a lot more. They also added Daily QUESTS, which is something every game needs, GUILDS, which is also something every game needs, and a lot more. Also, they do special things on their birthday!\n\nLike I said, this is not a full copy of agar.io.

They know most of the browser people will move to steam to play this game. Sure, it's a "copy", but a lot of games are based off other things, so you guys need to stop complaining. This game is far better than agar.io. However, that is just my opinion, but you guys need to chill about the "blatant copy" thing. Who gives a damn? It's a more enjoyable game, with more gamemodes.

Usually stick close to defenders or friendly predators. They like all game modes, and always hang in Random Team, as well as CTF. They are a dying species, and are smaller in size, might I add. Lots are left but aren't too common. I am personally a feeder.)\n\nDefenders (Use their large cells to defend team mates, and the flag depending on the game mode. They are seen in all game modes, and are very common.)\n\nPredators (Prey upon smaller cells; Most are hostile. They sometimes respect the Feeders peace if they get mass. They tend to hang out in All for One, Guild Wars and Random Team. They tend to stay away from CTF considering it has a different goal than to survive and kill. They are very common.)\n\nPeaceful players (Don't eat others; prefer to stay away from large crowds. They may sometimes be seen in All For One mode and Random Team. Hardly even a category anymore. They are smaller in size, like a feeder. They are dying out.)\n\nHostiles (Oh boy.. Well. The name speaks for itself. They are ruthless. Many still litter the population, and it's hard to pin point them. They are a lot like a Predator, but do not respect feeding boundaries. They DO NOT respect others either. If you kill one, you bet your ♥♥♥ they'll come and hunt you down like a dragon hunting for a measely chicken. Beware of these. They are seen in all game-modes, and WILL kill you. Steer clear of these beasts.)\n\nI rate the game 10/10. It's amazing, and I don't understand why it doesn't have more positive views. People who say it's a copy of some other game only dowloaded it to hate. Take your hate speech elsewhere. This game is overall better, and anyone who is new and wants more info, go ahead and talk with me.\n\n**EDIT***\n\nI found another kind of player in my adventures!!!\n\nBeggers (Always whining for them to feed them or team up.

Oh, I died)\nNot a lot of players (1v1 in teams wtf?)\nToo small of a room (I just came from the bottom half a second ago)\nNot enough viruses (There is like 3 tops lol)\nMore modes (Everything Agarmods has)\nPowerups are cheat-like (Really, you started that huge? And webbed wtf gtfo)\nI like to randomly click (I didn't want to release mass ffs)\nEasier to split viruses (Doesn't take all your mass like Agar.io)\nCells are kinda magnetic (They come to you kinda-ish)\nEating viruses bug in this game too\nCoins on the board (Nice feature instead of waiting to lvl for coins)\nSkins should not be allowed in teams mode (pumpkinfied, confuses me lol)\n\nSo to be honest, there are pros and cons to both games. If I had to pick between the two I would still go with Agar.io, just because there are more people, viruses, the map is bigger and it doesn't lag for me. I will still play this every now and then but once Agar.io comes to steam I am swapping. Teams is great on this game though, and that is usually the only thing I will playing. On second thought,I think I prefer this games teams to Agar.io's.

Play a few minutes in between other things, or have a few hours to spend trying to get big, either way works.\n\nThe gameplay is basic, but solid. You spawn as a circle/cell and you collect little things laying around to get bigger. Once you are big enough, you can eat smaller players by running into them. Games with this premise date back litterally as long as I've been alive, and probably further back as well.\nAs for this one, the bigger you are, the slower. So you can avoid the bigger players while gathering your own mass, and then come back to take them out instead.\nYou can split yourself in two for a speed boost and control both orbs to chase down your prey, and then you can keep splitting yourself again and again if you want to. Of course, being smaller like that means there is the risk that someone bigger than you comes by and eats up part of your cell, and you'll have to keep on running to avoid them.\nThat said, you can use the speedboost to run as well, when things are too bleak to stand for them, yet you want to not lose it all, leaving behind part of your collected mass may be preferable to losing it all.\nThere are also virus nodes, and eating those will burst you into smaller chunks. You can use this by throwing a part of your mass through these and then onto your opponent, thus giving you an easier snack.\n\nMitos.is comes with multiple game modes, including free for all, teams, CTF, and guild based modes. One thing I initially disliked was that FFA servers included people teaming up at times, but after a few more times playing I ended up realising how good this actually was for the tactics available in the game.\n\nOnce you're large, you may attract someone else who is a lot smaller. Sure, you could throw a whole lot of your mass over at him, eat his tiny amount of mass, and be vulnerable to bigger blobs coming to get you...Or you could not. Just let him stay around near you, buzzing around you and growing bigger in safety as you scare away (Or eat) anything that preys on the little guy. Then in turn, when someone bigger than you comes by, the small guy you've been protecting may throw his own mass at you to allow you to overcome the threat.\nAnd if you then throw back some to your new friend, both of you profit. I'm fairly sure this is how the first monkey-like creatures decided to start living together, and it works. Teaming up can arise organically, and there is nothing wrong with that. Just advanced survival tactics\n\nMitos.is is a simple but good game, it's easy to pick up, easy to put down, and varied enough to keep you playing it and coming back occasionally. It's small size and price of 'free' makes it hard to justify not giving it a try, but do not expect too much, it's not some deep masterpiece or complicated puzzle, it's just something nice for you to enjoy until you grow tired of it","September 28, 2015","true","7.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","1"

For example, Mortal Kombat is basically the same idea as Street Fighter, but you don't hear about that, do you? Mitos.is may be a more blatant rip off, but it still has its pros and cons.\n\nPros   Different Gamemodes  - Capture the Flag, Hunger Games, Team Fortress, Territory War, etc.\nVery User Oriented  - Allows you to play with your friends and create Guilds together.\nItems!  - Items create a way for users to become better as they level up (but items have their downsides)\n\nCons   Microtransactions  - Good items cost an arm and a leg. The very best people are just spending their way to victory. Personally I have not spent any money in this game and play pretty well with high-end items, as Mitos.is has many ways to earn coins besides buying them. Although it is still extremely frustrating to go against people with the best items.\nDomination  - People who have these amazing items are usually the ones who win the game. Specifically in guild war, the guilds with the best items are the ones who usually win.\nTeaming  - Come on, its Free For All, meaning no teams. The "teaming fatigue" Mitos.is gives is not nearly enough to stop people from teaming in-game.\n\nOverall I rate My toe sis  <- see what i did there  8.6/10, and if you enjoyed please leave a thumbs up in the review.","May 30","true","272.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

And, last but not least, there multiple different skins to choose from, and you make your own skin, with the right amount of coins, that is.\n\nOverall, this is a great game, and I really do recommend it. You will get more steam hours, and it is A LOT easier to play with friends and family, than playing Agar.io.","October 22, 2015","true","12.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

There are lots of gamemodes and skins to choose from, the gamemodes get really creative, like Hunger Games, soccer and much more, or you can just stick to plain old Free for All.\nYes, there are stat bonuses, but they are very small, some people say the game is bad because of the stat bonuses, but I don't mind, you're  the one who is supposed to decide about that.\nMaking your profile is fast, no email confirmation or things like that, you just type your username, confirm your password, and you are done.\nPeople who say the game is very laggy, you can change the server like US East, Russia and other things like that in the options.\nIts Agar.io with more gamemodes, more skins, and you can play with your best friends.\nAnd negative reviews, yes, I know you can go to agar.io on your browser, but you can't play with friends, and there aren't as many gamemodes as this one. I also know that it is a clone of Agar.io with more features, yes, we all know, do you think the game developers made the game, thinking that people will think its an original idea? No, of course not! They just wanted a game like Agar.io on steam. Yes, most of the reviews are old and say paywall everywhere, but they removed the paywalls and added in-game currency, the in-game currency is only for skins, EXTREMELY small stat bonuses and making private rooms to play with your friends alone.\nCoins are obtainable by getting chests and opening them for free, collecting coins while playing, and doing missions.\n(Yes, I know there are extremely small stat bonuses that cost in-game money.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trumpism/recommended/389570/","trumpism","Trumpism","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trumpism/","19 products in account","I've played Mitos.is for quite some time now and I can tell you one thing about the game, it never gets old (or at least for me) and the graphics compared to Agar.io's win by a long shot. Sure you might put it down for a little to play something else but if you generally enjoy taking away competition then this is the game for you. Let me explain the pro's and con's.\n\nPro's:\n\nI overall love the game, I think it's a great game if you're bored, have nothing to do, or just to play something different than to many FPS games that are generally remakes over and over. Here are some reasons why I have nearly 150 hours have play time on this game.\n\n• Never gets old. The more and more you play the game, the more it begins to be more than just a simple game of eating other globs of mass. If you actually play the game you will start to develop your own 'tactics' or 'strategies'. You'll begin to understand that maybe camping out under one of those spikey balls probably isn't the best idea if you want to reach the leaderboards. Sure, it's fun for poping people and watching people eat them but it ultimatly doesn't benefit you at all, unless you are big enough to eat them after you pop them. Which brings me to my next point.\n\n• More than one way to play. If you are one of those people from Agar.io (like me), you'll immediately think this is the same exact game, but it's not. The two games, although their similiar appearance, are very different. Sure they may ultimately have the same goal but its more than that. Agar.io, to me, is more of, "Try not be ate, and try to pick off the smallest people you can" which yes, is the same goal as Mitos.is but Mitos.is has way more variety. In Mitos.is you have armor, potions, etc. Which is a little misleading because at first you're like, "Oh god, how can I have a sword?" but really all they are is just perks.\n\n• You actually have a chance. In Mitos.is you actually can make it to number one, if you play smart. Everything is equally balanced with no-one ever having too much over the other. This could just be me, but it looks to me that the game is overall much more balanced than Agar.io. Never have I been able to get in the leaderboards in Agar.io, but when I did play it I constantly seen the same people in the lead. In Mitos.is you loose mass if you don't eat, which means that you won't stay huge forever. This creates a constant challenge for the lead. But if you play smart, you can stay in the leaderboard for a long time, but not forever.\n\nCon's:\n\n• The songs. Sure the songs are fun to hear... for about the first few times hearing them. Let me explain; there are literally a solid seven songs on the track to play. But considering that some of the songs range from 2-5 minutes-- they can become very repetitive and annoying. So annoying that after hearing them enough you might as well turn of your headphones or speaker and just turn your own music on. Now don't get me wrong, the music that is there sounds very good, but considering that the seven songs are just replayed over and over really isn't making me feel to excited. Not to mention the best ones are only played maybe once every two hours. A lot of the time you get to hear the same two or three over and over. Overall if they could add more tracks or at least play the other songs more I would be much more satisfied.\n\n• Have fun understanding chat. This is something that probably won't make or break the game for you, but it does make a difference. Being in US Central Time, the chat is usually in Spanish. This is very disappoiting to me considering that I'm American and expect to see English in the chat and not Spanish. I understand that sure, there are 'some' people who might live in Central Time that speak Spanish, in fact a lot do, but its common sense to know that when you see chat and  EVERYONE is speaking Spanish that you're probably not talking to an American. And this can be confirmed by simply going to google translate and translating in Spanish, "Where are you from?" and they all say "Mexico", or somewhere near there. Hopefully this will be improved over time, but over the time I've played, I've seen no change what-so-ever.","December 5, 2015","true","139.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","2","5","2","0"

Agar.io ripoff.\n- Basic gameplay.\n- Repetitive.\n- Bugs (see below).\n\nExamples of bugs:\nYou join a mode, but instead the game makes you join another mode.\nOne of your three daily missions wants you to do a certain thing, but the game sometimes fails to recognize that you did that thing.\nAfter the last updates, it seems to me that when you're small-medium sized, it's harder to eat the small cells: you split and your cell just pass through the smaller cell of your foe, without eating it.\n\n6.5 / 10","January 18","true","136.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Agar.io ripoff.\n- Basic gameplay.\n- Repetitive.\n- Bugs (see below).\n\nExamples of bugs:\nYou join a mode, but instead the game makes you join another mode.\nOne of your three daily missions wants you to do a certain thing, but the game sometimes fails to recognize that you did that thing.\nAfter the last updates, it seems to me that when you're small-medium sized, it's harder to eat the small cells: you split and your cell just pass through the smaller cell of your foe, without eating it.\n\n6.5 / 10","January 18","true","136.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's very simple and easy to play. Basically you're a cell that starts off small and you eat food dots to get bigger. Once you're bigger you can eat other cells that are smaller than you, while trying to escape from bigger cells that want to eat you. You also collect coins that you can use to buy armour and weapons that give you different abilities. New armour and weapons are unlocked as you level up. There are a few different modes, a couple are free-for-all and the others have two or three teams where you can team up with randomly assigned other players. I have heard people say that they don't like this game because it's very similar to Agario. I've never played Agario but from what I've seen of it Mitosis is like a new-and-improved version, and it is free so it's not like you're paying for a knock-off.\nWith it being free and taking hardly any time and space to install, it's worth giving a go for anyone.","December 2, 2015","true","65.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This is a serious problem in the game, if I start to play I want to claim the 1st. place but it is simply impossible to do so because in nearly every Lobby there are two or three guys who team up and dominate the game for hours. I dont have problems when it is an Team-Based gamemode but FFA is Free For All and its simply unfair. The worst thing is they make Clans and meet up in bigger Groups just to annoy the solo players.\n\nAs a solution I would recommend to ban the "Teamers" for a few days but for this you need a better Report-System with preselected Reasons for a Report. I hope you read this and some of the threads in the Mitos.is Groupdiscussions and fix this major problem.\n\nGrimm Hans.","January 4","true","33.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game also some gamemodes which aren't that creative. It also doesn't add anything new except you either grind to get skins,build a guild,etc or pay for it. It also has perks which the more expensive they are, the more overpowered they are. Basicly go play Agar.io on your browser.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nitrostarman/recommended/389570/","nitrostarman","NitroStarman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nitrostarman/","45 products in account","Wondering which game is better, Agar.io or Mitos.is? Easy answer when you look at the content of each game!\nHere are some obvious pros and cons about both games.\n(mobile version of both games have its own set of pros and cons so I will not go into detail about them)\n\nIf you don't want to read all of that then here is my opinion and review of the game:\nMitos.is is a great game that has a variety of gamemodes and activities to keep you entertained. I believe it is more immersive than Agar.io with the varied music and sounds that fit quite well with the game. Please read the Pros and Cons of both games below to understand why.\n\nAlso, I do know about the whole controversy about Mitos.is being a rip off of Agar.io. I do not know when either game was released. I do know that Mitos.is started on mobile and then recently got on Steam, and Agar.io started on the web browser and then recently got on mobile at about the same time as the other expanded into different platforms.\n\nThe main reason why Mitos.is is being called a rip off is because the skins are the same as Agar.io's skins. Also Agar.io got much more attention because Youtube stars such as Markiplier and JackSepticEye played it, leaving Mitos.is (which was only on mobile at the time) in the shadows. Play both games and develope your own opinion and comment them below if you can.\n\nAgar.io Pros and Cons:\nPros-\n1. can be played on any computer that uses the internet.\n2. quick jump in the action play and no account authorization needed.\n3. You can connect your Facebook to it for some bonuses that can help you survive longer.\n4. has a few gamemodes for variety.\n5. has free skins you can use for your cell by typing in a specific name.\nCons-\n1. no music and sounds. Sure you could play your own music in the background with another program, but I like to have some type of sound when you gobble up players and dots!\n2. no sense of progression after hitting the top 3 on leader multiple times (or just getting on it multiple times).\n3. can become tedious and repetitive after a couple hours or more of play time.\n4. for use of a skin you must type in a specific name and many other players are most likely using the same name and skin.\n5. has many of the same skins Mitos.is has and vise versa.\n\nMitos.is Pros and Cons:\nPros-\n1. has music and sounds. The music is great and not too repetitive.\n2. has an option to set up an account for level progression.\n3. level progression that unlocks items that can be bought with coins (which are earned, but can be bought with micro-transactions).\n4. coins are not a too difficult to accumulate and can be found in all gamemodes. also has acheivements and challenges that grant you more coins.\n5. has multiple gamemodes for a ridicalous amount of variety.\n6. has a guild thing and guild war gamemode.\n7. you can have your own personalized skin for your cell.\n8. has a chat system so you can rage or laugh at your opponents (and teammates) using text (it does have a filter for you protective parents to not worry).\n9. if you made an account with Mitos.is, it can be linked with mobile version and Steam version.\nCons-\n1. cannot be played on any computer. You need a Steam account to play unless you play mobile version.\n2. has many of the same skins as Agar.io and vise versa.\n3. skins are bought using coins and making your own can cost around 200 coins.\n4. personalized skins must be cleared for use by the Mitos.is team which can take as long as 4 days (which is understandable why it is like that).\n\nHey, you read the entire thing?

And wonderfully dynamic tactics that really shines when there are many players on screen. And the best thing about Mitosis is that it does require some quick thinking and reflexes, but is balanced so good that it never requires too much reflexes and too much thinking. Perfectly suited for relation after work, when you are spent and your brain is numb, but brain still wants something light to chew on and win and loose and get a little bit motivated and win again.

I wasn't expecting to find this today. And yes, it is an Agar clone, it copies many of the base mechanics of the game. I can't lie, I went into this planning to not recommend it, but it exceeds Agar to the point where I can't rightly disavow this game. It solves some of the biggest problems in Agar while having relatively minor ones of its own.\n\nPros:\n\nThe two "single-player" modes, free-for-all and deathmatch, are a godsend. Deathmatch has no teams at all, and FFA has optional teaming, and this might be the biggest improvement. It pacifies the teamers who insist on teaming in free-for-ALL, while also allowing a safe zone against that seemed to have more players.\n\nTeam mode is actually functional. I managed to find a teammate that actually helped me, which has never happened once in Agar.\n\nLeaderboards! I've been wanting those since day 1 in Agar, they allow rivalries to develop and give a sense of actual, tangible progress beyond the fairly meaningless levels. Finally.\n\nChat is there. I've only seen it used to team incompetently, but it is there.\n\n\nCons:\nUnlike Agar, this game literally allows you to pay to win. The transaction system is way worse than Agar ever was because you can actually pay for various advantages like increasing speed and lowering the time to merging. I haven't seen anyone doing this, and it seems like it would be really expensive to do so, but that's a horrible possibility for this game to have. These purchases are in the form of items you can also get by playing, which makes this even worse. You could be a genuinely huge fan of the game, work hard to get great equipment, but be superseded by someone who felt like dropping fifty bucks on a free-to-play game just so they could beat you.\n\nAgain, unlike Agar, smaller cells don't move independently. It didn't seem like that big of a problem at first, and eventually I got used to it, but it causes the defense of your smaller cells to take an enormous amount of effort. Not necessarily a problem, but it does make the game a little less fun by giving less of an incentive to split. It makes it harder to get as many kills, and to trick other people into maneurvering into a spot where you can split-kill, and I'm really just not sure why.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is a clone, and there just aren't as many people playing it. If you're looking for the fast-paced action of vanilla Agar, where you could streak across the board with multiple kills and instantly go from predator to prey, I couldn't really find that. But by that same token, that part of Agar has changed, so it's barely even a thing, let alone a problem.\n\n\nIf there weren't so many problems with Agar, I wouldn't have looked at this game. But it gets so many things right that Agar gets wrong, and with things looking like Agar might just stagnate under Miniclip stewardship, I actually might switch over to this completely. I wrote a lot about the flaws, but that's only because they're so glaring in the light of what is an obviously improved version of Agar. I didn't even play the other modes, but at this point, they can only improve my opinion of this game.","March 17","true","8.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

HOWEVER, if your teamates feed you when your meter is near human if your a zombie, just let them, it'll low the meter down to zombie again.\n\n8 and a half/10 I hope this review whas helpfull!

It is quite fun, has lively music, upgrades, levels, and several entertaining modes to choose from. I often find myself saying I'll just hop on for a bit and have a little fun and then find an hour or more has passed by wihtout my realizing it. :)  I would definitely recommend this game.","October 31, 2015","true","72.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kraligor/recommended/389570/","kraligor","kraligor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kraligor/","1013 products in account","I've been playing agar.io quite a lot, I'm pretty good at it, and I like it. So when I first heard of Mitos.is, I was rather annoyed because of the obvious plagiarism.\n\nWell, I'm not annoyed anymore. Mitos.is took a fun concept, copied it, expanded it, and made a standalone game. Mitos.is' devs aren't in for the quick and easy money. They're obviously putting a lot of effort and thought into the agar.io concept. And Mitos.is turned out to be the game I was hoping for when I discovered agar.io.\n\nDon't get me wrong - agar.io is still great, but it's limited. It's a fun, little game with quite some depth. Mitos.is made the little game a big game. Over the time, agar.io has been developed very conservatively, with small new features being implemented at a slow pace, and always careful that it still stayed agar.io. Mitos.is, on the other hand, expanded the game as progressively as you could imagine, and it turned out to work just great.\n\nAnd while, as stated, I do like both games, there is one thing that Mitos.is does better than agar.io: The endgame. Or, more specifically: the implementation of an endgame. agar.io always lacked it, and frankly, in the standard modes, Mitos.is does as well. It's just part of the concept. You get bigger and bigger, and then what? The thrilling phase is getting to the top3, then it becomes rather boring. With game modes like Zombies, CTF, Hunger Games and Terrain, Mitos.is gives you the opportunity to play limited rounds that you can win.\n\nAll in all: Mitos.is turned out to be great! And it's free, couldn't detect any p2w function.","December 30, 2015","true","9.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mallowy/recommended/389570/","Mallowy","Slime Drips","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mallowy/","256 products in account","TL;DR: It's like if Agar.io was unbarable.\nSo I tried this out because having a locally-saved alternative to Agar.io that doesnt require me to log into Facebook to use would be nice, but overall I was super disappointed by it and will be continuing to use Agar.io for all my cannibalistic blob needs.\n\nTHE GOOD:The menus are super slick and nice to look at. It's a very chill UI.\nThere's a simple map that helps point out where level boundaries are, or in some of the other gamemodes things like allies and objectives appear and it becomes a lot easier to navigate because of it.\nMitos.is is a LOT more ambitious with its gamemodes. When I played it there were like 5 or so? Your standard modes from Agar.io like Free-for-all and Team, but also things like Humans vs Zombies, Capture the Flag, and Soccer.\nTHE BAD:Despite being more ambitious with number of game modes, few feel much different from Free-For-All or Teams. Soccer was unique, but far too slow and allows teammates to steal points instead of encouraging teamwork.\nThe skins are trashy, boring, use stolen artwork, and often are based on garbage that crawled out of a "chan" site (I was not impressed by the crudely drawn "pedobear" skin). I'm surprised the devs haven't been hit with lawsuits when official artwork of Stewie from Family guy, Stitch from Lilo and Stitch, and Meatboy from Super Meatboy are all lined up side-by-side for you to chose as a skin for your blob.\nThere's levels and coins that seem to be useless. The most expensive skins are like 100 coins, and like I said theyre trash so there's no incentive to spend there. As far as I'm aware there's not anything unlocked when you level up either, so it's just a confusing useless mechanic to me.\nThey added music, but it's terrible - like really bad. Not only that, but it's muffled in the main menu so when I started playing I thought they were using like 32kbps .OGGs. Either way it's a waste of download size.\nWeird-♥♥♥ buttons. W, F, and Space all do different things and like, seriously? You're going to give me a hand cramp. Stop that.\nThere's odd RPG-style equipment that makes no sense. Like wow I can equip a tunic that gives me "+1% virus resistance". What does that mean? Why can a blob wear a tunic? How do tunics fit at all aesthetically? Why? Why?\nIt disconnects you if you idle in the menu for too long, which is not a huge thing, but it's certainly annoying to get up to do something then come back and have to wait ten seconds to be able to do things again.\nGives you an annoying pop up notification whenever you level up uselessly or get another meaningless achievement.\nPrivate rooms seem to cost coins? And like a lot of them? Who thought this was ok?\nProbably the worst thing, and more of an issue about not being genre-aware than actually making bad decisions: It desensitizes fun names. To me, the whole point of games like this when silly things happen like getting chased by "POLAND" only to have "NASA" descend from the heavens and devour them, saving you. This is a real thing that happened to me in Agar.io and hasn't in Mitos.is because of the way things are set up. See, it lets you have nicknames like Agar.io does, but it ruins that by making you sign up to play the game, which in turn gives you a default name to fall back on instead of encouraging you to come up with a funny one. This becomes a problem when you go into a room and everyone's name is some boring very username-y thing that kills the fun of it. Not only that, but a few gamemodes straight up strip your name and/or skin away, destroying any semblance of context-based humor that Agar.io is known for.\nAll in all Mitos.is has a heaping handful of reasons why it's way worse than Agar.io. There's just nothing going for it that makes it worth being chosen over Agar.io. All the differences that make it more ambitious are handled poorly and undermine any potential they had. The only thing going for it is the map, but that's not worth enough to overcome Mitos.is' shortcomings.\n\nThis has been a very serious review for a game about tiny jelly blobs voring each other.","January 26","false","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Também podes obtar pelos jogos Free-For-All (FFA), Hunger Games (ou Jogos Vorazes), Random Teams, ou o clássico, Pickup the Flag!\nRealmente, recomendo este jogo, e se não gostares dele à primeira vista, testa-o e talvez mudes de ideia.","October 23, 2015","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Whoever though recreating the same game only this time with semi working multiplayer with friends is a hack and does not deserve any credit. There are no original ideas here. This game is crap, the servers suck, people can just camp the whole map with 3 guys at the top feeding each other.  Not to mention random teleports and crappy players overall. This game is a boring piece of crap and a waste of time, not worth the 5 second download.","October 25, 2015","false","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You don't need a good computer to run it and it can be competitive.\nYou can have clans and make clan wars, play Hunger Games, FFA (Free for All), random teams, or choose the classic "Pickup the Flag" game!\nI recommend this game, and if you don't like it at first glance, I recomend you just give it a try. Maby you'll change your mind!\n\nPortuguese----------------------------------Eu gosto desde jogo.\nPode parecer que o jogo é apenas outra cópia do Agar.io mas o pensamento muda assim que o começamos a jogar.\nÉ bastante divertido, tem som e música (coisa que o Agar.io tem, mas apenas com o uso de extensões de browser e mods), e mais, tem bons gráficos! Não precisas de um computador extremo para o jogares, e o próprio jogo pode se tornar bastante competitivo. Podes entrar num Clan, criar um Clan, e claro, fazer uma guerra de Clans! Também podes obtar pelos jogos Free-For-All (FFA), Hunger Games (ou Jogos Vorazes), Random Teams, ou o clássico, Pickup the Flag!\nRealmente, recomendo este jogo, e se não gostares dele à primeira vista, testa-o e talvez mudes de ideia.","October 23, 2015","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is quite fun, has lively music, upgrades, levels, and several entertaining modes to choose from.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mallowy/recommended/389570/","Mallowy","Slime Drips","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mallowy/","256 products in account","TL;DR: It's like if Agar.io was unbarable.\nSo I tried this out because having a locally-saved alternative to Agar.io that doesnt require me to log into Facebook to use would be nice, but overall I was super disappointed by it and will be continuing to use Agar.io for all my cannibalistic blob needs.\n\nTHE GOOD:The menus are super slick and nice to look at. It's a very chill UI.\nThere's a simple map that helps point out where level boundaries are, or in some of the other gamemodes things like allies and objectives appear and it becomes a lot easier to navigate because of it.\nMitos.is is a LOT more ambitious with its gamemodes. When I played it there were like 5 or so? Your standard modes from Agar.io like Free-for-all and Team, but also things like Humans vs Zombies, Capture the Flag, and Soccer.\nTHE BAD:Despite being more ambitious with number of game modes, few feel much different from Free-For-All or Teams. Soccer was unique, but far too slow and allows teammates to steal points instead of encouraging teamwork.\nThe skins are trashy, boring, use stolen artwork, and often are based on garbage that crawled out of a "chan" site (I was not impressed by the crudely drawn "pedobear" skin). I'm surprised the devs haven't been hit with lawsuits when official artwork of Stewie from Family guy, Stitch from Lilo and Stitch, and Meatboy from Super Meatboy are all lined up side-by-side for you to chose as a skin for your blob.\nThere's levels and coins that seem to be useless. The most expensive skins are like 100 coins, and like I said theyre trash so there's no incentive to spend there. As far as I'm aware there's not anything unlocked when you level up either, so it's just a confusing useless mechanic to me.\nThey added music, but it's terrible - like really bad. Not only that, but it's muffled in the main menu so when I started playing I thought they were using like 32kbps .OGGs. Either way it's a waste of download size.\nWeird-♥♥♥ buttons. W, F, and Space all do different things and like, seriously? You're going to give me a hand cramp. Stop that.\nThere's odd RPG-style equipment that makes no sense. Like wow I can equip a tunic that gives me "+1% virus resistance". What does that mean? Why can a blob wear a tunic? How do tunics fit at all aesthetically? Why? Why?\nIt disconnects you if you idle in the menu for too long, which is not a huge thing, but it's certainly annoying to get up to do something then come back and have to wait ten seconds to be able to do things again.\nGives you an annoying pop up notification whenever you level up uselessly or get another meaningless achievement.\nPrivate rooms seem to cost coins? And like a lot of them? Who thought this was ok?\nProbably the worst thing, and more of an issue about not being genre-aware than actually making bad decisions: It desensitizes fun names. To me, the whole point of games like this when silly things happen like getting chased by "POLAND" only to have "NASA" descend from the heavens and devour them, saving you. This is a real thing that happened to me in Agar.io and hasn't in Mitos.is because of the way things are set up. See, it lets you have nicknames like Agar.io does, but it ruins that by making you sign up to play the game, which in turn gives you a default name to fall back on instead of encouraging you to come up with a funny one. This becomes a problem when you go into a room and everyone's name is some boring very username-y thing that kills the fun of it. Not only that, but a few gamemodes straight up strip your name and/or skin away, destroying any semblance of context-based humor that Agar.io is known for.\nAll in all Mitos.is has a heaping handful of reasons why it's way worse than Agar.io. There's just nothing going for it that makes it worth being chosen over Agar.io. All the differences that make it more ambitious are handled poorly and undermine any potential they had. The only thing going for it is the map, but that's not worth enough to overcome Mitos.is' shortcomings.\n\nThis has been a very serious review for a game about tiny jelly blobs voring each other.","January 26","false","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
