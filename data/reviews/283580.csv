This is really drawing me away from playing this game because I have to sit there for five minutes waiting for the game to actually start.\n\nMy Logitech G27 is barely compatible with this game. If I move the wheel to the left in 5 seconds then it actually takes 10 seconds for the wheel in the game to move making it hard to drive. This is one of my only bus games where my steering wheel doesn't work.\n\nOverall, don't buy this game, it is such a waste. Buy OMSI 2 instead, it is a much better bus simulator.\n\nUPDATE 1/23/2016: I've been trying to play this game and it doesn't work anymore. When I try to play, the game crashes and takes me back to my desktop. This game is such a waste of money.","January 23, 2015","false","8.4"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","23","27","2","0"

BROKEN!!!! Do not buy. The Monte has warned you. From falling into the ground 2 minutes in to most of the controls not even being mapped is just plain BS. I have never seen such a piece of junk game in my life. I have tried a few times and about 5 minutes into a campaign I get stuck inside a bus that drove up on the sidewalk working to the garage one campaign mission 1. After these 2 stupid issues and the inability to skip scenes just WOW. Please Please Please do not by this trash. Good gaming and see you all around. I hope I saved a life today. :) Did I mention how bad this game is.
