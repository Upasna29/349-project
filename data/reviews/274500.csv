The visuals are good. The mechanics are good. The map design is good.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0O9iohLRw\n\nBrigador's a good mech game, which seems to be a rare commodity these days. It's an isometric shooter with systems bigger and more complex than 'put your mouse on the bad guy robot and press the button,' the biggest of which is the aiming system, since it's three-dimensional. You can overshoot or fall short of targets, and the camera works in conjunction with this. Unlike another recent top-down shooter with a banging synth soundtrack, the shifting camera won't give you motion sickness, and you won't get oneshot from offscreen. Differing armor values for front, sides, and rear (for enemies AND for players) means that flanking isn't just viable, it's vital, and different acceleration, handling, and speed while traveling in different directions in different vehicles means that even two vehicles of the same class feel and play differently.\n\nYour tower tank can plow through enemy and environment alike while absorbing blow after blow; your mech can peek and retreat around corners, fire over low walls or crouch to hide behind them, and stomp anything that dares get close; your main battle tank is fast and maneuverable with a low profile and a speed boost for hit-and-run attacks; and your antigrav can weave in and out of buildings, strafe targets without exposing vulnerable side armor, or belly flop on enemies who make the mistake of letting you get close.\n\nI've been playtesting the game since early alpha builds and the progress it's made is astounding. The game is gorgeous and never stops being fun to play. 60 hours later I still constantly get the itch to boot it up and throw together a new build to see how far I can get with it. There's really no game on the market that plays quite like it. This game is good and you should buy it.\n\nAlso protip: equip the Parliament.","October 16, 2015","true","122.0"," 60 of 72 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","60","72","2","3"

I've been playing it for a long time and it's gotten better and better. It's a great looking game with tricky but well crafted controls, and strong, intuitive mechanics. and a lot of work has gone into making it hard without making you hate it or want to quit. This isn't a roguelike, but you will need to cultivate true roguelike spirit to play Brigador: you will die often, it will always be fair and your deaths will come from your own mistakes or overconfident actions, and the only good response is to roll up a new brigador and try again. There are a ton of vehicles and guns and the combinations lead to pretty wildly divergent playstyles.\n\nThe 'setting' and 'lore' are all under the surface. you won't be reading morrowind books here, you'll just get a feel for the world from the experience of playing in it and destroying your home city and everyone you ever cared about or knew for a fat stack of cash and a ticket offplanet.\n\nI look forward to the brigador dating sim sequel.","October 16, 2015","true","13.1"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","36","42","5","1"

The controls are tight and responsive, although they may take a bit of getting used to. Enemies are diverse in both attributes and behavior, and the environments are dense and interesting. I really respect the devs for choosing to not color every explosive element red, although I cursed their names the first time i discovered this fact.\n\nThe graphics are excellent. I don't know what voodoo magic allows such accurate-looking lighting effects in a 2d game, but it is strong, and arcane. You really have to see it in motion to appreciate it. The overall visual density is high, and honestly pretty busy, but it gets much easier to read the action after a few games.\n\nThe game presents a stiff challenge, but not an unfair one. At first you'll find yourself overwhelmed by all the threats coming at you from every direction, but soon you'll learn how to use the environment to your advantage and manage the flow of battle. Smoke is your friend!\n\nThere are six vehicles to choose from in the current build (there have been more in pre-release builds and certainly will be again) and many different weapons, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. This level of choice is one of the game's greatest strengths, but may also be the biggest stumbling block for new players, since it's easy to choose a loadout that doesn't have good synergy, and get completely owned.\n\nPro tip: try the loyalist mech "Touro" with the cannon "Abbot", machine gun "Mae Dois", and smoke launcher. It's a very powerful combo. But definitely don't stick to it! Try all kinds of things and have a great old time.\n\nI strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes arcade or action games, as well as anyone who thinks trucks, tanks, and mechs are cool.","October 16, 2015","true","13.7"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","19","21","2","0"

You can play brigador sneaky deaky like and cloak or if your the Arnold type rush in guns blazing.\n\nCurrently there are 9 vehicles to pilot ranging from hover tanks, to mechs, to something that looks straight out of a red necks fantasy... yep an el camino with a giant monster cannon.\n\nYour goal in one of these vehicles is to either sneak or shoot your way into various locations and destroy the glorious leaders cannons, generals, or just massacre a percentage of his army.\n\nThe controls are a bit difficult at first to get used to as you must handle your turret, your legs/tank (which rotate separately) while maintaining aim with your guns and their ranges. Meaning 3 things at once which I am rather poor at.\n\nIf this hectic gameplay isnt your style there are hover tanks you can use that have locked turrets. Keep in mind the developers have promised 40+ new vehicles coming before Brigador leaves steam early access.\n\nThat being said after a few hours with the game the controls get simpler. I found the sniping / sneaking gameplay to be my forte as it let me move slowly and set things up as opposed to the large hectic fights where I ended up slamming into the walls screaming at my keyboard.\n\nOverall I think Brigador is a solid game for being at the early stages of development. I do think the price point is a bit high but once the game is finished it will definitely be worth that cost.\n\nMy only real complaint with the game was the controls and thats more my fault at being an old man than the fault of the game.\n\nMy full video review is linked below\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJehhe4PT1U","October 27, 2015","true","1.5"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","25","32","0","2"

But thankfully this game is extremely easy to mod. I don't know anything about code, and I never modded any game before, yet in Brigador I was able to make an instagib mod, change all the weapons' attributes and make my own weapons, make enemies tougher, completely revamp the lighting, modify the movement behavior of all player vehicles and change the enemy spawnlists (and thus even get access to unimplemented content that was present in the gamefiles) - and most of those things can be done on-the-fly while in the game. On top of that there's a map editor as well. You could even make your own units, though for that you need experience in either 3D modelling or at least basic spritework - unless you're fine with recombining the existing leg and chassis parts which you can do pretty easily.\n\nIn short, pretty much every aspect of the game can be modified either in-game via a really handy and easy to use dev-console, or by basic text file editing in the gamefolder. That alone would already be enough for me to recommend this game, but since it's coupled with an excellent base game as well I really can't stress how much you'll get out of this game if you're even remotely interested in mech and tank games.","February 8","true","194.7"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","28","38","0","0"

If you liked classic westwood C&C games environments, attention to detail and music, Brigador will likely give you nostalgia. If you simply like quick and easy to play action games like nuclear throne or spelunky, Brigador is going to appeal to the same style of fun.\n\nIn a way the game is incredibly simple, you can just run in and shoot things until you get to the end, but it's so well made that the simplicity only really helps the game. You pick a vehicle, two guns and a special weapon (I recommend smoke grenades with the tauro mech) and need to complete one of three objectives per area, all of which involve blowing things up. Enemy AI allows for you to either stealth your way in or out, maneuver your way around at high speeds dodging shots, or simply bust your way through walls crushing anything in your way.\n\nDespite all this, the game is tough: you cannot regain health at all except by killing enemies to regain your shields, so avoiding damage by killing fast or playing smart is essential if you want to get to the end and off of the planet. Ammo management is also an issue, as you need to either harvest it from your enemies without blowing it up first or regain it from depots that correspond to your ammo type, which are often surrounded by enemies. Keep in mind that if you don't need the ammo type, you can just use the depot as an explosive to still save you some shots. An added layer of difficulty comes from optionally playing as lighter, more agile mechs that definitely require finesse to control compared to other options such a pillar of scrap on treads. You can expect any vehicle to reward you if you use it right however.\n\nAs a game Brigador is definitely fun, as a mech game Brigador plain rules. The perspective, graphics, explosions, destructible environment and hordes of enemies you take down really make it feel like you're a piece of heavy weaponry and not just a reskinned human. If you like mechs, buy this game.","October 24, 2015","true","8.1"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","14","16","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arkstralian/recommended/274500/","arkstralian","Ark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arkstralian/","206 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBrigador is the ambitious and exciting debut from independent developer Stellar Jockeys, boasting lavishly rendered isometric spritework whose variety of design styles and nighttime-neon colour palette fit perfectly with an unforgiving, crisp control scheme to remind me of the classics of the 1980's and 1990's (Akira, Mechwarrior, Blade Runner) in both gameplay and looks.\n\nIt's important to note that the game is in early access, the way the term was likely intended to be used. The developers are actively following a development roadmap that sees them churning out maps and vehicles as they continue to build the game around the existing skeleton you can play here. Yes, the current experience is rough if you are expecting a paid beta experience: the menus are barebones, most of the sound effects are missing, there's a lot of functionality on the cards such as an unlock system and selectable pilots that we won't see for a while. That's okay, because it means the majority of work has gone into fine-tuning the game's systems to create an enjoyable and frentic experience best likened to a curious mix of Syndicate Wars, Desert Strike, Future Cop: LAPD and the Mechwarrior titles on the Super Famicom which featured similarly isometric views and wanton destruction.\n\nBrigador's difficulty is, once you're familiar with the simple controls and the flow of the game, somewhat self-imposed. You can identify pretty quickly which of the game's vehicles (tanks, mechs and antigravs) gels with your playstyle the most and then which weapons you find the most useful on top of that. Whether you go with the same pair of big, kick-♥♥♥ cannons in every run or try to mix it up a little is up to you, and the vehicle mounts available. The longer you stick around, and the more maps you complete, the more difficult the enemies you'll find coming at you. If you're low on shields and ammo and aren't feeling like you can weather another big fight, the option is always there to hit up the spaceport as your next map and fight your way to an escape.\n\nThe soundtrack, by New Retro Wave artist Makeup and Vanity Set, is pretty damn good. It's not just playing at the 80's throwback fad half-heartedly, it's lurid and drenched in neon with big, dramatic synth. The only downside is the song selection is another aspect under development: the game just picks from a playlist right now and runs through it. What's there is great, though, and helps make up for the lack of sound effects currently implemented.\n\nThe game is by no means perfect, but it's short and sweet and to the point. For something so heavily under development, what's playable is incredibly crisp and very enjoyable. Whenever you die, it usually feels like it was something you did wrong rather than getting caught out by imbalanced mechanics or ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bugs. The onus is on Stellar Jockeys to keep the pace of development up, because the quicker this game's skeleton is built on, the quicker the attention is going to snap to it. If you're scared off by the very minimal trappings of a game under construction then you probably don't want to buy Brigador just yet. On the other hand, if you like the idea of tossing some change to a handful of guys making a very earnest and solid shooter with a bumping soundtrack, go for it. Unlike most of the early-access survival FPS pixel garbage on Steam, this is actually fun and cool.","November 10, 2015","true","9.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerstevenmills/recommended/274500/","gamerstevenmills","Teppy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerstevenmills/","398 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhen I was first presented with the opportunity to cover Brigador, I’ll admit, I had no clue what it was. I did a little bit of research and discovered the upcoming game, being developed a group of four guys under the name ‘Stellar Jockeys‘, striven to be a isometric hybrid of ‘Syndicate‘ and ‘Mechwarrior‘. After reading that I was determined to jump into Brigador without any further knowledge of the game and see how much fun I had, and let me tell you; I had a ton of fun.\n\nDamn is Brigador a beautiful game. The game is set in the bright and bustling isometric cityscape of Solo Nobre. At launch there are nine very detailed levels/districts to Solo Nobre, each with their own unique but similar layout. At the beginning of each mission (dubbed contract’s in the game), you choose from one of three categories: tanks, mechs, and anti-gravity vehicles. The tanks are typically defensive, the mechs primarily offensive, and the anti-gravity vehicles are fast. Each mech has it’s own weapons and play style as well as toughness when taking damage.\n\nFrom here you’re thrown into the contract you selected and begin dishing out massive destruction to anything and everything in the district. The entire map is fully destructible, including attacking enemy vehicles, all of the buildings and enemy defenses, and even the civilians attempting to flee the city from your carnage. There are quite a few unique weapons in Brigador, all of which take some getting used to. You move using the W-A-S-D and a mouse, but it’s not as simple as it sounds. The movement is similar to Resident Evil in that you use the A and D keys to rotate your vehicle in places, W to move forward, and S to move backwards. You have a red and a blue line that project from your vehicle in different arcs and help show you where your weapons will be fired. Using this system you can aim high, low, and even around buildings to take out aerial or ground enemies at command.\n\nBrigador is tough. On top of the intricate(but fair)movement system, the enemies themselves are quite challenging. By design, there is no saving or restarting, so you must play through the district’s clearing out enemies and completing the objectives of your contract to move forward. While keeping track of your ammunition is certainly important, there are ammo stations scattered across each map, and defeating some enemies will result in them dropping ammo packs to replenish your ammo. That being said, successfully completing a level carries over your current ammunition counts and health, meaning to ‘beat’ the game you would have to complete each district in one sitting and straight playthrough.\n\nIf you’re a fan of isometric ‘top down’ shooter type games, Brigador is definitely for you. As I mentioned before, it’s an extremely beautiful game, and a ton of fun. Destroying the city of Solo Nobre while wiping out your enemies and completing your contracts does require a bit of strategic shooting, but is enjoyable the whole way. While the game itself was a bit too difficult for me to successfully clear all districts in one sitting, I feel as though that’s necessary with a game like Brigador. The only thing I’d ask for is perhaps more of a story or campaign rather than just “Complete Objectives in all Districts’, but after playing through all of them there is definitely the feeling of some repetition.\n\nBrigador enters early access on October 20th at the price of $20 on Steam and Humble and plans to add more content throughout the early access stage.\n\nThis review score is based on its Early Access launch. We may or may not do another review for this game once it enters the full retail launch phase.\n\nhttp://gametabloid.com/review/brigador","October 16, 2015","true","0.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Did you ever wonder what it would be like to play as a tank instead of a helicopter? If you did this game might be for you.\n\nIf you didn't Brigador is a great isometric tank/mech/antigrav piloting game where, at the moment,  you can only do runs on a smaller number of maps(more will be added) with two objectives: Kill enemy captains or destroy orbital cannons, both are available which to complete is up to you. There will be pilots and pilot centric missions added later with a shop system to buy weapons and such ingame. Devs plan to have a large number of vehicles and weapons added with a decent number ingame already.\n\nMost common complaints ive seen deal with the tank controls, which take a bit of getting used to but once you do I think they are the best choice for this type of game.\n\nNow, as for what you can do with the game and some of the most fun things I see in it.\n-Ambushes with smoke grenades\n-Lobbing artillery barrages over walls to decimate an unwary group of enemies\n-Dropping an EMP grenade in the middle of a group of antigrav tanks and going to town on them\n-Squishing infantry with a tank\n-Squishing tanks with a mech\n-Plowing through walls in the tanks and mechs\n-Piercing walls and subsequently my enemies with a powerful rail gun\n-Bombing an orbital cannon with two shotgun cannons\n-Using active camo to hightail it before enemies arrive\n-Driving an old chevy turned into a antigrav racer, turned into a hit-n-run vehicle armed with ridiculously large guns\n-Finding out what parts of the destroyable terrain explode much more violently than others\n-Learning those little guys with lasers do actually hurt\n-Frying those little guys with my laser\n-Learning armor facing does in fact make a difference for tanks\n-Running over innocents that look like they are all wearing yellow raincoats\n-Running out of ammo and ramming an enemy tank to death from behind\n-HATE motorcycles\n-Stray projectile blows up an ammo depot I desperately needed\n-Blows up an ammo depot I was about to use by driving into it\n-Chain reaction of exploding buildings caused by myself or anyone else\n-Realize antigrav tanks can strafe\n-Strafe into explosives by accident while dodging enemy fire\n\nIn case you forgot while reading those, this is all things I liked.

While flawed, it's a highly enjoyable "garbage day" game when you can't be bothered thinking too much. Really a twin-stick shooter rather than a mech game, but the mechs feel authentically "mechy" enough that I still enjoyed the game a lot!\n\nThe gameplay is VERY satisfying, but I only discovered this only after I switched the graphics into a more performance-focussed setting. I'm not really sure why my modest-but-modern laptop was behaving this way with an isometric game, but hey-ho. The fantastic weapon sound effects and feedback feeds into this; it's hard to describe the gameplay in anything other than vague floaty terms like "crisp".\n\nOn the other hand, the 'campaign' (Which felt a bit like an extended tutorial to be honest) gives you a small selection of fixed loadouts and a mission to accomplish. I found it to be a bit short, although any longer and it'd probably overstay it's welcome. Only a couple of missions felt really distinct, like the one which starts you with no ammo, and you have to race to the end to pick some up. The rest of the missions sadly felt a bit samey, Futhermore, the challenge in these missions zig-zags drastically; I never really got stuck, but some of the earlier missions were rather tough, but the very last one was a cake walk. The factions you face in these missions clearly have subtle differences, but I never felt like the gameplay was telling me "This is Faction X, this is Their Hat." On the other hand, you could argue that this means the various enemy factions aren't gimmicky.\n\nFreelancer mode is the real meat of the game. The only issue is that you have to accrue and spend limited winnings on equipment which has no description before you purchase it, so you either have to randomly buy bits and pieces and hope for something interesting, or hope you've used it the in campaign and know what it does. Most annoyingly, this post-release game (as of time of writing) still hasn't got all the weapon and vehicle descriptions in it yet.\n\nSo in summary, the gameplay is really good. The campaign is decent, but leaves you wanting more. That more can probably be found in Freelancer mode, but it doesn't tell you all you need to know in some cases, and is a bit grindy. It's good enough for me to comfortably recommend it, but I can't say "BUY THIS NOW!" until the weapon descriptions are finished, and maybe they add some DLC content, built to the high standard of the base game.","June 5","true","8.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mechanicallions/recommended/274500/","mechanicallions","Mechanical Lions","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mechanicallions/","552 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nConfession:\n\nSlightly biased towards the devs of this game, but only because I've watched them polish this game for quite a while. What it started from, the assets they hand crafted themselves (didn't borrow or steal), the fact they got a great musician that actually fit their game to work with the sound track and so forth sell me a game. I think of it as investing in someone's idea and dream as much as buying a product. They always chatted me up and answered my questions, so I  pre-ordered this long before Steam was even a reality. I'd probably give them a positive review even if the game were a steaming heap.... which it's NOT.\n\nControls:\n\nWhile this game can be a frantic iso-mecha-tric shooter, the controls are very much akin to tanks and mecha. Which means A and D will swivel the torso, W and S and will move front to back,  while mouse actually moves the aim. This takes quite a bit of getting used to, but tip is to look at the spotlights that the vehicle shines on the ground. One will be for the body/movement and one will be for aiming. The problem as it stands now is they can be harder to distinguish, become blocked by terrain/obsticles and generally get disorienting. I wouldn't have the game control any other way, however. It's true to the idea behind the vehicles and its something a bit fresher feeling over the generic point/click/move. There is a skill curve that makes sense and it's not just throwing square wheels on a car to make it harder to drive. This game will be something you will get better at playing as you play it. If you want a game you can sit down and be great at and win immediatly, then consider something else.\n\nTip: I'd recommend starting with the tank as the graphic serves a much better indication as to how to control it.\n\nTactics:\n\nThe control set actually lends itself to a slightly slower gameplay that requries a bit of tactical movement on the players behalf. This isn't a game where you will endlessly kill mindless enemies. Your ammo is quite limited, though can sometimes be refilled by random towers or rare drops. Position matters where you shoot the enemy. Charging things without considering that you are just wasting ammo by shooting them from the front is bad form. You do more damage from the side or the back, so dodging and timing shots can be much more benefical over going pure John Rambo. There are also "Special" weapons. Smoke bombs which obstruct enemy view so it can help escape and positioning. Camo for the sneaky type and EMP grenades that I just rarely use.\n\nTip: To save ammo, use your melee attack on smaller enemies like footmen and in desperation against light craft. Stealth can combine with this for fun results.\n\nWorld Design\n\nIsometric was just a perfect choice. It's very reminiscent of the 16/32 bit era of "Strike" games which pleases me greatly. Everything can be destroyed and you can carve a path through the level with your machine. Each weapon can affect the enviroment differently and of course there's explosive structures that can be used tactically.\n\nTip: Blow everything up. It's cathartic.\n\nSoundtrack:\n\nAs a huge fan of synthwave/cyberpunk music, I was already a fan of Makeup and Vanity Set. His soundtrack for this game just helps a great deal setting the atmosphere. It's always nice to see a game seek someone that works better than just getting someone to fill in because their cousin can make beats. The soundtrack is very much part of the game. It's not just an afterthought asset at the bottom of the budget. Devs take note!\n\nContent:\n\nAs far as content, there is much much more to be added. I'll update this review accordingly to reflect this. Right now you can do basic runs and it's generally a sandbox with everything unlocked. You have complete mission freedom. You can kill a set number of enemies, find the commanders and kill them all or take out a few of the orbital cannons and advance to the next. In the future there will be unlocks and money as well as many more missions and tilesets. Also coming will be controller support, which may be a better alternative for the controls for some.\n\nVerdict:\n\nA very thought-out design from top to bottom. The dev/brother team knew what they wanted to make and executed in a masterclass fashion. They have built an amazingly solid housing for their game. Now, the rest is just moving some more content into it and making the price tag more tempting.  The price doesn't bother me in the least. In a world of cheap sales, that only bring disposable titles or F2P games that are more timetraps than video games, I'd always pay premium for something like this. 20$ is hardly "premium" pricing though. I would have paid half that for the soundtrack alone.  This is a game I can revisit because after all it's actually a video game. Not storybook on rails or a grindfest because grinding because modern video games. Also: MECHA!!.. extremely underused theme.","October 17, 2015","true","2.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Mother. Of. Christ!\n\nThis game somehow manages to be visceral while also making you play in a methodical, tactical manner. It's understated and yet bombastic at the same time.\n\nSimply put: play pre-made campaign maps to acquire money, use that money to purchase pilots, vehicles (mech/tanks), weapons and semi-procedural missions then mix and match for huge replay value in the freelance mode. It's a super simple career-esque formula that feels like an arcade version of MechWarrior Mercenaries and I love it!\n(NOTE: I say "career mode", but it really isn't that deep, don't expect a management game here).\n\nCombat is satisfying and varied due to the wild loadout combinations you can create; fast, light mechs with heavy weapons, giant, slow walkers with enough "dakka" to put the greenskins to shame and any variation in between. I personally recommend the 'Fork' mech with dual 'disco' turrets (example  here).\n\nThe game is not easy, but at no point does it feel unfair. It can be difficult to get the hang of aiming at first, but all the projectile arc information really is right there in front of you, so it doesn't take long to figure out. As long as you don't rush in and try to take on swarms of enemies all at once you should be good. Just like MechWarrior Online, this is a form of cover shooter; sneak behind buildings and only engage when you've got the advantage. And speaking of buildings, everything is destructible... and I mean everything.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a simple isometric mech/tank action game with some light customisation, fully destructible environments and a great synthwave soundtrack. Recommended!","June 4","true","12.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldershot/recommended/274500/","aldershot","[F!] Aldershot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldershot/","2454 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBrigador is a tactical isometric shooter where every thing in the environment is destructible. At the time of this review, the game is still incomplete but shows a lot of promise in it's well designed gameplay.\n\nBrigador is a challenging game to say the least. A player's first inclination is to shoot everything in sight, but you'll quickly learn that strategy will get you killed pretty fast. Your ammo is limited, your HP don't regenerate, and the game features a perma-death system. With out careful planning and strategic thinking, you'll become scrap metal in an instant. The game has a high learning curve, and an equally high skill ceiling. The game makes no concession to casual players.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Hf5arkwBc8&ab_channel=aldershot8008\nThe goal of the game is to enter an enemy territory, shoot out 3 of their cannons, and then get the hell out of there. It sounds simpler than it actually is. In any given map, there will be tons of enemies swarming to blow you up if you're not careful, as well as environmental hazards. Gas pipes, oil stations, and other things can easily blow up in your face ending your run. Then there are mud, tracks, and sand that will slow you down. Though there are hazards, the environment is completely destructible, allowing you to make your own path to the goals, avoiding the dangerous main roads.\n\nBefore even starting your mission, you'll be able to pick your vehicle, weapons, and special abilities. there are 6 different vehicles that are variations of 3 different types, tank, mech, and hover. Tanks have good Armour and speed, while mechs can use a powerful stomp, and hovers can strife and are the quickest, but they're balanced with low armour and HP. They all have their own unique characteristics and stats, and the same can be said about the weapons and specials as well. The game offers a fair degree of customization and experimentation, allowing the player to tailor their ship to their play style.\n\nBrigador also features detailed but visually clear sprites in an isometric environment. The aesthetics have a classic PC look to it, and it's one of my favorite elements of the game. The art is interesting, full of nuance, and does a good job at communicating it's overall theme and atmosphere of a dystopian future. The sound design is also quite pleasing, with an appropriately futuristic OST and sound effects that has impact. However, since the game is in early access, some sound effects aren't implemented and is distracting from what is an otherwise polished presentation.\n\nThere's a lot of stuff to like about the game, it's presentation, it's skill oriented gameplay, and the destructible environments, however in it's current state, the game does feel incomplete. Currently, there is only one mode to play, endless mode, nothing to unlock, no stat tracking, and no story mode. So basically, the game is bare bones feeling very very beta. Of course it's in early access and these things are to be expected, but it is something worth mentioning for any one expecting a complete game. Bragador does not feel complete. There is a lot of room to grow and I am excited to see where it goes. One feature I really would like to see added is some kind of multiplayer. But until the game is further updated / released, it doesn't give much incentive for the player to keep playing, other than it's core gameplay, and maybe experimenting with different combinations of weapons and ships.\n\nOverall, Brigador is a very promising game, that in my opinion, has the potential to be a cult favorite. All the game need to do now is to fill itself out a little. Give the player a reason to come back regularly. We'll see how it'll turn out once it's a full release, but so far, so good.\n\nPros:\n- Great classical looking visuals\n- Challenging and rewarding gameplay\n- Destructible environments\n- customization\n\nCons:\n- Missing sound assests\n- limited game modes\n- Feels incomplete\n\nBrigador hours played: 3\nCompletion Status on Brigador: N/A\nThis copy of The Brigador was given by the developer","October 23, 2015","true","3.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

As others have said, it's not a perfect game, but it is a very fun game. I think it will have a lot of replayability with what comes in the Early Access and I expect that to expand further between now and full-release.

Resurrecting a forgotten genre which started with the classic arcade hit Zaxxon which later evolved into hits such as Crusader and Desert Strike, Brigador delievers an updated experience from the past.  Frantic tactical gameplay coupled with a full destructible landscape, immersive audio effects, and fantastic musical score make Brigador a successful triumph.  Tactics which at first glance don't seeming relevant actually become the only way you can survive.  Go in guns blazing with no strategy and watch amazingly as your health widdles down to nothing.  You've got to use your head in this one folks and that's what makes it stand out. Once you get used to the controls that is (took me a couple hours) things quickly fall into place and feel almost perfect.  Don't give up because mech/tank position, aiming, and control are extremely daunting at first.  Just practice and try to have patience and things will start feeling natural.\n\nThough I've barely scratched the surface of the game being only 4 hours in I can already see a wall of content awaits as well as a very intense challenge.  Tons of pilots, mechs, tanks, hovercraft, and weapons to unlock.  The combinations in which I haven't even remotely begun to explore seem endless.  Just an awesome title.  What else can I say?

It has style, an excellent soundtrack, and the gameplay is fun, exciting, challenging and rewarding. I sank hundreds of hours playing games like Desert Strike / Jungle Strike when I was growing up, and this game hits on the spirit of those titles and cranks up the style factor to 11. The lighting, the tone, the abundant use of neon, the weighted feel to the mechs, the insane level of environmental destructability, the audio design, and the synth heavy soundtrack all makes this game a very unique package.

Neither did I actually, until Brigador showed me how much fun machine-assisted murder can be. Happiness, as they say, is a warm Howitzer.\n\nI've now spent about 6 hours playing Brigador, and I really like what I've seen so far. There's a lot more depth and immersion to it than I'd expected from an isometric shooter—you can interact with any and every object in the map, which generally involves either smashing it or blowing it sky high. Some structures are relatively benign, others will explode and take a big whack of your shields out with them. So you'll want to start thinking at street level even as you take advantage of the top-down perspective to locate enemies and engage them on your own terms.\n\nBrigador is tough. Very tough. Like, approaching roguelike levels of hardness. There's no quicksave—you either complete your run by escaping via the spaceport or you die in the process. This engenders a more methodical pace than you'd expect to see in your typical shooter—cover becomes critical, and all your weapons make noise which serves to attract more enemies. As much fun as it is to Gatling Gun that MiniMart into rubble, letting everyone know where you are will get you swarmed by more enemies than it's humanly possible to fight off, losing you the game in a matter of seconds. So destroy responsibly.\n\nControls feel unworkably clunky at first—using WASD and mouse for Resident Evil-style tank controls (to be fair, you *are* actually controlling a tank) takes some serious getting used to. Don't expect to feel very fluid with it for the first hour or so. After that you kind of grow into it. No controller support currently, but with the way aiming works I can't see how they'd ever be able to implement it anyway.\n\nI don't regret dropping $20 on Brigador despite it being unfinished at this stage—though if you're on the fence you can wait until it's out of Early Access and judge the complete game then. Devs have said they won't raise the price at launch, so it's not like you have to jump in now. But yeah, good game.

Having to turn the base of your mech/tank and then move forward seems just turns a fun game into a fight with the controls. The only reason it seems to be there is to make one or two vehicles a pain in the a** to drive. A few have a turret that can't turn 360, so you need to turn the base to reach anyone behind you. The AI isn't smart enough to use this against you though, so it seems to be an annoyance more than a feature. I've died more times because the AI swarmed me and I couldn't see which way the tiny arrow was facing, then anything. If they could add a feature to turn on/off auto rotation of your base the controls wouldn't be such a mess, or multiplayer so there would be someone to fight that might actually know how to take advantage of your restricted movement.","May 16","true","0.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I'm assuming you've watched the trailers and are familiar w/ the basics of the arcade-style shooter genre.\n\nGamplay:\n\nUPDATE: With the release of the full game, the quantity of vehicles and weapons available to the player in campaign and freeplay mode have increased greatly.  Whereas the EA was working w/ about a dozen vehicles and weapons, there are now 4 or 5 times as many.  This obviously makes for a much more replayable game; figuring out optimal builds for each vehicle and which vehicles suit your playstyle has become a much richer experience b/c of the increased variety. You can choose to play either through the game's 20-mission campaign which follows the story of liberating Solo Nobre as a mercenary, or play one-off missions in the game's freeplay mode.  Any currency gained from either mode carries over to the other and allows the player to purchase intel, vehicles, weapons, lore, and different pilots for use in freeplay. I think this mechanic works well as it doesn't lock the player in to playing strictly the campaign, everything in the game is accessible at all times, provided you've racked up enough currency from completing missions.\nEARLY ACCESS:I've been having a ton of fun w/ Brigador; it's relatively simple in gameplay, but w/ depth of difficulty and strategy that emerges the longer you play.  I was up and running w/in a few minutes of booting this game up for the first time, but even after 20 hours or so, I'm still learning about the nuances of each vehicle and weapon available in the game, as well as enemy behavior and countering tactics.\n\nAudio:\n\nUPDATE: Following the full release of the game, music and sound effects have been more fully integrated into the game. Updates include a greater quanitity of vehicle and weapons sounds, as well as the integration of the full OST into campaign maps.  I can't overstress how much the original music adds to the experience of this game; if you're into synthpop, this game is just a joy to run around in.\nEARLY ACCESS:The in-game audio pushes Brigador from something that I'd probably otherwise enjoy to a great gaming experience.  The music is a stand-out as contributing a great deal to the atmosphere and enjoyability of playing, but it's not alone.  The weapon and vehicle sound effects, automatic weapons in particular, are rich and obviously got a lot of love from the devs.\n\nGraphics/Misc:\n\nEARLY ACCESS: I've seen a few pre-release builds since purchasing and all of them show a great deal of attention to detail from level design to animation to UX: I've gotten a great deal of satisfaction out of how smooth the game's animations are.  I get the feeling that the devs took a great deal of time in getting vehicle movement and weapon usage right; I've seen other games that use mechs and tanks end up w/ much clunkier vehicle movement, which can kill the fun quickly. Every vehicle in this game has a realistic sense of movement and presence in the game world, as do environmental destruction and weapon effects.  Graphics options are limited to resolution, V-Sync, and a few other options, but I found that these options are sufficient.\n\nDevs:\n\nLastly, I always consider it a good sign when the developers of a game have a presence in the Steam forums and these guys are on top of that.  I've asked several questions and have always received quick answers from devs or knowledgable community members.  I always enjoy knowing that I can run to the forums w/ questions or comments and receive something other than a "get gud" response from the community.","May 30","true","26.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

I know I only played a little bit, but there really wasn't much to draw me in and make me want to play more. There is currently no story, it's not the funnest to drive around extremly slowly in an enviroment that really doesn't look that appealing, and the enemies are both not frequent enough to make such a slow speed enjoyable, and they are kind of annoying to try and shoot down.

I think not matter the absolute control will in this game or not, players will always happy to see more thinking, more design, more possibility in the game, maybe some goodwill design to help users based on the control way right now? making players feel more comfortable will always be right. even like dark soul, game famous because tough, in dark soul 2 there still a lot of change to help the players get more comfortable for the game.

I dont think its so simple question about my refund (im not asking and i didnt ask for refund), if the designer is really thinking about the market things, really dislike the negative followed by the negative reviews, I think it's the time to take care of this problem seriously. i hope next time, when we talking in a not bad Atmosphere, the helpless things like "I can't spend any more time to talk with u" "I dont believe u" "u just spend 48 mins on this game, I spend 3 years",these things seems not need to appear anymore.\n\nso, in a simple way to say: I like this game, not worth $19, bad experience for control. hope to see more improvement","October 21, 2015","false","1.0"," 18 of 64 people (28%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","28","18","64","2","3"

Brigador is a great game I loves the Mechanics and the small details that make the game succeed 10X more opposing to other games like this particular one. I personally love how the Mechanics of the tank works and how it operates . The all out warfare is amazing it always feels like you are in action and are in a war. Brigador is a pretty great game although it feels like it is a grind and not so much of a story mode which makes the game aspect a little wrong, although the game is mostly action and couldn't use a story mode it would at least be neat to add a little story along the mayhem is happening. Another thing that I don't particularry like is the Ammo aspect if you were a full on metal War Machine you wouldn't be running out of ammo you would at least have some storage for ammo.

Brigador is an isometric vehicular shooter with fantastic production values and excellent look and feel.  The devs have focused early resources on the core gameplay, which is really quite good.  Even with the small subset of weapons and vehicles now available, the game manages to pull me back every so often just so I can experience that kick-♥♥♥, blow ♥♥♥♥ up feeling one more time.\n\nThat gameplay features a modest number of player vehicles which fall into three categories: Mechs, Tanks and Anti-gravs.  Mechs have high acceleration and modest speed, but have a powerful stomp attack that is devastating to grounded enemies and the environment.  Tanks can boost for short periods to plow through the same at high speed (although the 'Dragon' actually slows down, it pretty much obliterates anything it touches).  Anti-gravs are unique in that they turn their entire chassis to aim, but they can move in any direction and can float over short obstacles.  They also slam the ground, but typically deal substantially less damage than the mech or tank equivelant.\n\nThe weapons available have varying statistics of shield damage, hull damage, environment damage, penetration and rate of fire.  At this point, ammo doesn't appear to be used to balance weapons, but is simply commensurate with the rate of fire.  Each vehicle can mount two weapons.  Usually these are weapons of different size categories, but some vehicles have two of the same mount.  The weapon balance is currently spotty, due to the fact that the unlock system has not yet been implemented and we're likely several balance passes away from 1.0 as it is.  Some weapons are fantastically effective, like the tank cannon (can't remember its actual name), while others are less than spectacular (the 8mm burst-fire, for example).\n\nBrigador features a host of mechanics that really bring the visceral combat to life.  The AI is excellent in that it relies on line of sight, as well as the sound of weapon fire to locate the player.  The enemies start off basically flat-footed, many with their shields unpowered.  If you get the drop on them, you can take down quite a few hit-and-run style.  The moment you join battle though, nearby enemies will start closing in to investigate.  If you hide at this point, it's quite doable to avoid contact or better yet, lead your enemies into a killzone of your choosing.  Attacking enemies from behind is literally twice as effective as shooting their fronts, so it's often better to hit them on your terms than to simply charge into the middle of them.  You can use the environment to your advantage by setting off devastating chain reactions from explosive structures or by attacking the enemy through the very obstacles blocking them from returning fire.  Even the height of individual units is important, with the 'tower-like' enemies being able to spot and return fire over low-obstacles, whilst the tanks and infantry are stuck moving to get a shot.\n\nAs other reviewers have said, the price point is high for the content the game currently has, but let's be frank; This is Steam.  The dev needs to set their price point high if the game is going to display value to potential backers, and so that it can still be an equitable return when the inevitable Steam sales roll through.  It also means that they can get additional resources early on and not live in squalor hoping their game will make it big when it leaves early access, which we all know is /far/ from a guarantee; It's a fool's gamble.  For what it's worth, the game in its current state easily convinces me that the dev can fulfill their remaining content goals within the six months they've given themselves.\n\nEDIT: Oh, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the excellent original score.  It's a high-tempo, arcade-style throw-back to 80's action movies that suits the aesthetic and general tone impeccably.","October 29, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(PS1).\n\npros:\n- Freelance mode allows mech customization\n- A lot of guns to choose from\n- Most guns feel very good to shoot\n- Big maps with destructible environments\n- Difficulty is quite high, encounters require some thought\n\ncons:\n- story mode is meh\n- no saves during missions, even between maps","June 6","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Difficult. No gimmicks. Choose vehicle, equipment, pilot, mission. Win or die. No fancy stuff, just pure gameplay with good soundscape, music and visuals. More than worth the price. Still receives dev support. Balance is wonky, but difficulty is optional.","June 6","true","21.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
