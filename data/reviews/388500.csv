The eyesore of a UI doesn't really do anything besides look annoying. You have the opportunity to use  some other weapons besides your rifle, like grenades or something, but there is really no point in using anything else because your rifle is just fine against the three enemies you come across. However many enemy types there appear to be in the game doesn't really matter because they all pretty much seem to act the same. So, in short, combat is bland.\n\nThe levels are randomized to an extent, but they are mostly just empty and identical to one another. You can go around picking up ammo or credits (which seem to do nothing), but once enemies are dead you are free to move on to the next area.There is some kind of story you get from reading logs in some levels but they get repeated often, are told out of order, and, above else, are just boring.\n\nThere weren't really any bugs, so maybe that is a plus. But really, I don't know if there was anything fun or engaging in the game. It was a really forgettable experience everytime I tried to play, and it just felt really incomplete. All things considered, Super Space Meltdown is like you are wandering down a corridor when suddenly.","September 19, 2015","false","0.7"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","91","30","33","14","0"

That's it.\nAssuming you do get to level 20, the game resets anyway.\n\nI couldn't really find any instructions or guide anywhere, but basically there are 1-3 crates per room to give you extra weapons like mines, turrets, grenades, and ammo and super ammo clips.\n\nYou can also get credits, but they don't seem to do anything and I never saw any use for them, other than an achievement.\n\nIf you do die, and the game resets, you also get to keep any extra weapons you had when you died. There's also some random data terminals around, but none of them seemed to have any information on changing the ending.\n\nThe only real randomization to the game is the order of the levels (after the first level), which seems strange because this probably could have made a decent roguelike.\n\nUnfortunately no controller support, and the controls can't be changed.\n\nProbabably 30-60 minutes of entertainment for most people, so $4 seems a bit overpriced.\nFortunately I got it in a bundle (probably along with 99% of everyone else who has it).\n\nNot too bad, but not great either.","November 8, 2015","true","5.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

For the first 30 minutes the player just goes around and kills stuff and there is not indication that there is a story line!!! (There is a story line)\nI then found of something very interesting about the story, spoliers?, this game seems to take place before alien star menace. I am sure that very few people have heard that name but look it up and play it on your phone if you are interested at all. Super Space Meltdown just happens to have the same graphics as alien star menace but the game itself falls very short of alien star menace. It seems like they just wanted an interesting story for gamers who are bored on long car rides so they played a game on there phones called alien star menace.\nThis game seems like it didn't put a lot of effort it but at the same time I enjoyed the first couple of deaths.\nBuy this game at your own risk!\nAlso if you want to check out my YouTube review then here it is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzU9BSuo7vI","August 21, 2015","false","0.3"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","45","10","22","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SolomonThePhat/recommended/388500/","SolomonThePhat","Nicfromspace","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SolomonThePhat/","282 products in account","Super Space Meltdown is a top- down 2D rogue-like dungeon crawler set on an alien infested space station.\n\nThe game has a nice soundtrack which sets the tone of the environment very well. The sound effects have a retro feel which complement the pixel-art style very well.\n\nThe pixel art is well defined and colorful. All the sprites on screen are distinct in style and shape. However, there are no options to adjust graphical settings, such as windowed support, adjusting resolutions, adjusting refresh rate, or any more advanced settings.\n\nThe gameplay premise is simple. Complete each level within 60 seconds. If the timer runs out or you die, you restart from the beginning and play a random series of levels maintaining the equipment from the previous run. This is where the rouge-like elements come into play. However, it does become repetitive after a time. Perhaps farther in could yield more exciting level design or a boss fight, which would add some much needed variety.\n\nThe controls are difficult to get used to. Your character can play equipment, such as mines or turrets, and shoot with your rifle. Your character can only shoot in a straight line. However, nowhere in the game is there listed a tutorial for any of this information. The game needs a tutorial for the controls, or at least a list of key bindings, which you also cannot currently rebind. Also, this game would benefit hugely from controller support, or at least the ability to rebind keys.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend this game yet, despite its price, which is $3.99 at the time of writing. It is a simple game that provides enjoyment, if repetitive, at the most basic level. If you enjoy rogue-like games, this is up your alley. However, this game fails in any kind of customization. Hopefully an update comes soon which could allow four things which would benefit it heavily; Controller support, an in-game tutorial or at least a list of controls, graphical options, and key bindings. After those changes, this game would be vastly superior to its current form and would be worth an extended play.\n\nIf you'd like to see some gameplay and first impressions, check here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3934ehn5co8\n","August 23, 2015","false","0.4"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","6","15","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WhitemageSerenia/recommended/388500/","WhitemageSerenia","WhitemageSerenia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WhitemageSerenia/","219 products in account","Super Space Meltdown is a game.  Yep.  It's a game, you can just spam the fire button for great justice, the special weapons all feel relatively useless and your gun auto locks on to anything that is in your "lane" North, South, East, or West of you, you can also only move in those directions, no diagonals here. You have 60 seconds to beat each floor, and each floor is also randomized.  The enemies rarely attack, and when they do attack their shots are somewhat easy to dodge, also enemies take a ton of shots to kill, your hand will hurt.  Some stages seem to feature laser traps that near instant kill you if you're caught in one.  The game offers no instructions on how play the game, and feels clunky with keyboard controls and no way to remap them ingame.  Though using Xpadder to map the buttons to my gamepad certainly helped a ton.  The game is also locked into Fullscreen only mode, and for one reason or another kept crashing on me when I launched it.  I was finally able to get a good launch and record some of the game play (I played poorly).  All in all, you get what you pay for.\n\nSome thoughts that could improve this game.  First and Foremost, being able to attack diagonally.  Many times I lost a few seconds of time because an enemy would just move to one of my diagonals making me have to fully reposition just to hit them, even though the enemy was still adjacent to me.   Second, maybe progressive levels?  What I mean is, I like the random aspect, but maybe make enemies on lower floors easier/take less shots to kill, but they get harder the more floors you go down, this could encourage the use of proper tactics and not just mash spacebar.  I feel as though that you need more health/ammo pick ups (Unless I just somehow missed them), as well as maybe tweak the special weapons some, as I felt they were a bit on the useless side of things.  The Turret was nice, but you can't retrieve it, or replace it once you've used it, and it doesn't last long before it explodes.  The grenade is really clunky, its explosion range only seems to damage the imidiate square that it blew up in, same with the time bomb and proximity mine.  The Proximity mine could definitely use a buff, make it to where it blows up the square its in, and the squares adjacent to it in a 3x3 grid.  I didn't like the fact that the enemy needed to be directly on top of it to register "Hey I need to blow up now!"\n\nAll in all, for the pricepoint of the game, its relatively decent, but it didn't hold my attention all that long.  I'd give it somewhere in the ballpark of 4/10, decent, but not great\n\nLink to my Video of this game:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rELnUsHYeIw","August 12, 2015","true","0.6"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","40","6","15","4","0"
