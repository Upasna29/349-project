While there are no specific hidden object scenes, you do have to look for, and click on tiny objects.  Another similarity is the backtracking to pass obstacles.\n\nFor example, a bridge is out, and you need three pieces of stone, a rope, twelve ocelot furs, an eskimo translator, and a toaster oven in order to repair the bridge.  You remember that there was an old woman in a village a couple of screens back that offered to give you her toaster oven in exchange for a potion that will treat her husbands ED.  You also know that a rural healer specializing in potions is in need of an attorney for his practicing medicine without a license case.  Additionally, you met an out of work attorney, who will take any case as long as you can provide him with five hundred gold coins, and a "personal massage device".\n\nSuch is the recursive nature of this type of game, and although it can be frustrating at times, the bizarre Goldbergian machinations somehow appeal to my sense of humor.  I mean, there is currency in the game, gold coins actually, yet so many transactions have to be completed with some random item the NPC desires instead.  Imagine if you took your car in for repair, and instead of money, the mechanic demanded a live elk.  Such is the world the Hero of the kingdom inhabits.\n\nWhile I'm at it, I must say, this guy has got to be one of the most inept, clumsy heroes around, because it seems like every other time I use any sort of tool, it breaks.  Going fishing?  Oops. broke the rod, have to buy a new one.  Harvesting flowers?  Oops, broke the sickle, have to, wait, hold on, why did you even need a sickle to pick flowers?  Anyway, you get the point.  Mr. Hero is no Bob Villa, and if he ever asks you to borrow any tools, just remember that this is a guy who can break a piece of steel on a flower stem.\n\nIn conclusion, to sum it up, to summarize, to wrap it all up, to encapsulate, to distill, um, I forget what I was going to say.  I guess if you like pointy clicky roundabout games, this is one and if you don't, it still is.","February 21, 2015","true","7.2"," 175 of 188 people (93%) found this review helpful 144 people found this review funny","93","175","188","144","6"

The game style blends elements of point-and-click adventure games, resource management/economy games, and role-playing games.  It is extremely casual and relaxing, but also is rewarding.  It is by no means an epic, immersive, high-budget AAA title, but it is a great casual experience for those who would appreciate it.\n\nThis is the sequel to the original game in the franchise, Hero of the Kingdom.  It is essentially the same game as far as mechanics and gameplay go, with only very minor differences.  This game has a more elaborate storyline and is longer, but it is still an extremely simplistic and casual experience (like the first).  The narrative is not a direct sequel, so you do not have to worry about playing this game without playing the first.\n\nThe game plays as a point-and-click adventure, essentially— with an inventory and a narrative.  In order to progress (i.e.: complete quests) you must pass inventory checks that determine if you have enough of specific items.  Thus, playing the game boils down to growing your inventory in two ways.  By finding camouflaged objects on the screen and clicking on them.  And by bartering with the NPCs; there are numerous profitable NPC-trading loops that can be used to make money and buy inventory items you need.\n\nThe narrative is extremely light; there are very few total lines of text.  While it isn’t bad, it also is easily forgettable.  But it does a good enough job creating a feeling of advancement and incentive as you complete quests.  There are also a lot of well-spaced achievements (both in game and on Steam) that pop-up often to keep the game feeling rewarding as you progress through the campaign.\n\nFor those who seek more intense gaming experiences, you may find this game somewhat tedious.  However, if you like tranquil, addictive games that are rewarding, there is a good chance you will enjoy Hero of the Kingdom II; and will probably like the first one as well.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","October 18, 2015","true","7.7"," 105 of 117 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","105","117","4","0"

Number II is more difficult than the first and it is  bigger  in comparison to the first game, this is from my experiences of playing both games and  I have 100% both games.\n\nI have totally enjoyed playing this game, it to me was very relaxing and pieceful, but at times  became challenging but never frustrating, exspecially  when you loose your way, and cant find what your looking for, when this occurred it was time to take a break and play again later. You also must remember to barter and trade, i found buying wheat and getting it milled, then selling it to the baker helped me accumulate enough gold to progress, so if your short of gold this is how I found best to do this, but there are other ways to do this aswell, with other items you come across.\n\nIf you enjoy point and click type games and have the patience to play them, then you may well enjoy this game as I most certainly did. But i will say, that this game is not for everyone, but again what game is for everyone, it all comes down to personal choices and your taste in game types.\n\nAlso how long a game takes to complete should not matter, i did not race through to finish this game, i took my time and explored the game making sure i did not miss a thing and kudos, i found everything and got my 100% Achievements tonight.\n\nAlso price wise, i believe its a fair and reasonable price to pay for this game type, this is my opinion anyway, but others may have differant views with regards to the pricing, there are always sales, so if your on a tight budget, and would like this game then wait for a good sale. :)\n\nI'd like to thank Lonely Troop for this lovely game, i really enjoyed playing it. I will also look forward to more of your games in the future, and now i must chase those lovely emoticons for both games, they look awesome and i want them all, if i can get them all that is, Im sure i will. ;)","February 22, 2015","true","19.4"," 47 of 52 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","47","52","0","4"

And I've finished it in one sitting, because I was enjoying myself so much. And now we have the sequel.\n\nWhat is this game about?\n\nHero of the Kingdom 2 is pretty much a casual point and click adventure, but it has more to it, because there are some elements from roleplaying games, like collecting different resources, making multiple small choices and exploring new places. You play as the nicest hero of all heroes that ever walked the earth, spreading happiness and doing goodness around the world. It doesn't play like traditional adventure games, but it's the closest genre I can compare it to. It reminded me a little of these Fighting Fantasy books I used to own, except you can't really lose here.\n\nGameplay\n\nWell, you point, click and do magic. There are a lot of hidden objects through the game, so among doing different tasks for people, you will also be collecting food and anything you can sell, because there are many items and tools you'll need to carry through. Some you can find, some you can buy. Game doesn't hold your hand in this, even if you are limited to your actions, you can decide what to do. Whenever you find hammer in a barrel, or you'll buy it and waste money, that's on you. In addition to items, you use stamina to do most of the activities, and you have to sleep to regain it. Nothing is entirely for free, so you have to do a little bit of planning. Game's pace is just good enough to keep you interested, you are always exploring, there is always something new to do.\n\nSound & visuals\n\nTraditional painted 2D graphics are beautiful. It's a nice change from cartoony graphics many games utilize today, so you don't see this type of graphics too often. Because of that, the game has this timeless look to it. Music is decent enough to set up the atmosphere, even after listening to it for a while, it doesn't get annoying, and sounds that play whenever you do something are silly enough to become classic to me already.\n\nOverall impressions\n\nI just love how naive, upbeat and positive this game is! Compared to the first game, it's more of the same, bigger, better and just as enjoyable. If you've played Hero of the Kingdom 1, you'll love this one too. Surely it's not everyone's cup of tea, but there is something charming about this game that attract people I would otherwise never expect to play something like that.\n\nIt's not too long, a humble little game, it will probaby take you around 5-6 hours to finish it, but for the price, it's a steal. All those hours are packed with joy, so I say give it a try!","February 21, 2015","true","5.3"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","33","35","0","0"

The gameplay structure is mostly untouched, as is the UI/map/sound/etc. and that isn't really a bad thing here.  This series is a causal resource-management set of games and the familiarity between titles makes it very easy to jump right into this.  You'll be collecting x amount of items y and z so the miller's wife can sell you bread without skipping a beat.\n\nThe story is super generic fantasy and comes with a stiff English translation.  The visuals are very nice and the style really works well.  There are no annoying technical issues or gimmick gameplay bits to get in the way of you fetch-questing for the rest of the kingdom.\n\nThere are a couple of downsides, though.  HotKII is a bit longer than the first game, but this is mainly because item amount requirements can get kind of sizable and repetitive at times.  Building the boat is probably the biggest example of this.  The other problem I had is that there is some pixel-hunting required at times for items that don't visually "pop" from the rest of the art and don't have an "action" command signposting them.  There's only a couple of instances of you having to do this to progress but it can be quite annoying when you can't find the blacksmith's toolbox or whatever since it's super tiny and just blends into the background without doing anything in particular to draw your eye to it.\n\nIn short, if you liked the first game, you should probably pick this up.  If you've never played the first one and find this in a bundle a year from now, it's a nice, little resource management game where you can't find yourself in a fail state and is oddly relaxing and addicting to play.  It'll take about five hours or so to see everything there is to see but it's an enjoyable, light game that is ideal for zoning out and chilling.\n\nOne last thing, you can continue playing after beating the game, so unlike the first one, there's no worry about a point of no return.","March 5, 2015","true","5.1"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","35","39","0","1"

Been waiting for this from a loooooong time!\n\n+ The biggest 'PRO' of this game is that it's EXTREMELY FUN to play. It's relaxing, soothing, immerse, and most of all FUN.\n\n+ Awesome Story: It's about how a common village boy struggles to save his sister and along the journey helps everyone he meets.\n\n+ Casual, Fun, Relaxing: This is not a super hardcore game, just a casual one which will make you smile and happy! ;)\n\n+ World, Environment, Aesthetics: The graphics may not be top-notch, but the aesthetics are awesome! You are really transported into another world. You can feel the stuff happening around you, you actually start believing that you are the protagonist.\n\n+ Unique gameplay: It's purely point and click, but it's not like your common hidden object game either. It mixes hidden object, strategy, decision-making and RPG elements into one single combo and trust me.. it's worth trying.\n\n+ NON-LINEAR: Unlike the first one, there's a plethora of things to do and a plethora of ways to do it. You'll have to make many smart choices as to how to proceed. I don't think it's possible to get stuck, but the game might get extremely slow if you keep on making bad choices.\n\n± Sountrack: The soundtrack is amazing. But it's pretty much exactly the same as the first game. I was hoping for a little change/variety.\n\n- There are *SOME* objects which are very tough to find, and it can get frustrating very quickly. But if it does, you can always ask it on the discussions page and we will be happy to help!\n\n- There's one more problem with the game. There are several skills which are unlocked later but it is very likely that you will do things and never know why you did them. I killed tons of spiders and zombies to reach nothing but dead ends and no award. I kind of started thinking it was just a way to make me lose my gold until I unlocked the lock-picking skill after which it all made sense. Maybe a marker on locked objects stating you need to learn how to unlock would have made me less furious.\n\nThis game is built on the same engine as the First one, except that it has some better animations/bigger sprites and support for different profiles/save games.\n\nBe sure to check out my review of the first part to get a rough idea about what you can expect.\n\nRating: 9/10\nI subtracted a point from the original because of some more cons in the game. But added a point for an overall more non-linear gameplay.","February 21, 2015","true","6.1"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","27","31","0","0"

And unless you quickly grind (build low and sell high) you might have a money problem in the early mid game. But this is a casual game and the solultions are quick and easy. Curiously, a couple of the hidden objects needed to be subjected to some pre release testing. It's fine to hide stuff but at least make the object recognizable as the object it is supposed to be.\n\nBut in the big picture those were minor quibbles. This game is as enjoyable as the first game.  But it is a tad longer, the game world is a tad bigger  and it has a number of unque settings that didn't exist in the first game. But HOTK2 is just a fun simple game to play. It sure is curious how these developers are the first to exploit this unique sub genre of RPGs and HOGs. Seems like this type of game should have been around for a while. But kudos to the  developers.

It’s a short, casual game that’s a unique blend between the genres of lite-RPG and hidden object game. I’ve never played anything like it, and I think the developers have a great casual game formula going. Basically, your hero explores the countryside, a city, and neighboring islands while helping residents and gathering items and money in order to complete the main goal of saving the hero’s sister. It’s a delightful, family-friendly game and while I would recommend it to anyone who likes casual adventure games, I think Hero of the Kingdom 2 is especially good for young children.\n\nKeep in mind that the RPG elements in the game are very LITE – so, if you’re after a more traditional cRPG experience, this isn’t quite the game for you. While your hero learns skills, there are no stat allocations, nor can your hero make any choices that can alter their adventure. Also, combat is very simple – if you have the required items needed to initiate combat, you WILL win.\n\nAnother warning is that Hero of the Kingdom 2 will only take a few hours to complete (it took me 4 hours). While the actual gameplay mechanics are delightful, and while the game appears very polished (the musical score is particularly high-quality), it’s far from being a cost-efficient game on Steam. The price/time element is definitely something to consider here, considering that there are many <$10 games that you can buy which can provide at least 50 hours of gameplay.\n\nIf/when the developers work on Hero of the Kingdom 3, I would like to see minor interface improvements (for example, I believe that the hero’s health and gold amounts should be visible at all times). Most importantly, the developers need to work on storytelling and refining sentence structure. Here’s a snippet of game text:\n\n“The workers did a good job. But they should work with tools more carefully. They have broken my saw.”\n\nI wish the developers the best of luck with Hero of the Kingdom 3, as they’re innovating casual gaming, but I also hope that the future game text is presented with more polish and professionalism.","March 7, 2015","true","4.9"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

The game has a kind of retro charm to it which brings you right back to the more simple times of gaming. It was simple enough to not get too frustrated with it and was also complex enough to not get promptly bored.

After your sister got kidnapped by pirates, you set out on the trace of their hideout in order to rescue her while travelling the land and seas and helping people across the kingdom.\n\nPros: This game is exactly like its predecessor: a light straightforward adventure where you walk from location to location, gathering the items, money and resources you need to unlock quests and win fame points to continue on your path. As you do so, the map gradually unveils itself. One change, though, are the skills: there are more of them and they unlock all variety of an item type (many that are gathered on the maps "hidden objects" style) so the quantity of items feels much more massive than my memory of the first game. The setting also is and feels very different than the previous game, and you eventually travel to multiple islands in your quest to fight the pirates and discover the mystery behind their intention.\n\nCons: The game is just as linear as the first one. There is little strategy save the order in which you accomplish quests, which merely require you to have the proper inventory to succeed. The crafting system is way too over complicated, 90% of the things you can combine and exchange for other things and items you'll barely ever need. Enemies and loot never regenerate, save the occasional animal hunting. There is no replay value to this game: if you played it once, you've seen everything the game has to offer.\n\nVerdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you\n\nThis game is so much like its predecessor, in both mechanics, graphics and length, and gets a minor recommendation from me. However, if you didn't like the first Hero of the Kingdom game or were hoping the developers had up the ante, you'll be thoroughly disappointed.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","May 24","true","7.1"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

By completing quests you gain fame points, which mark your advancement in game.\n\nThe story is great. It's one of those stories you were read to as a child or told by your grandfather. The music is very soothing and only adds to the calm athmospere of the game.  The scenery is breathtaking and the searchable items are not as tiny as in the first game, thus easier to find.\n\nI have finished the game an hour ago and I am already experiencing serious withdrawal. 10/10\n","February 21, 2015","true","7.2"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","2"

If you did not played previous part... well, you can play Hero of the Kingdom II and not worry about storyline. These two games are not connected with each other and their storylines do not cross. In fact, second part contains a couple of tiny references to the first part, but... it does not matter.\n\nSo. You move between locations, collect different objects, interact with characters and solve quests. Game is very calm and leisurable, there is absolutely no hurry - just enjoy beautiful surroundings, filled with a lot of small lovely details. In my opinion, art-style in Hero of the Kingdom II is excellent.\n\nThe plot is very simple, naive and absolutely predictable. Unfortunately, game is completely linear and there is no replayability. To be honest, there is a couple of quests where you can try alternative way of solving, but it is only a timid and hesitant step on the way to diversity.\n\nSometimes Hero of the Kingdom II can be quite tedious. Gameplay is mainly focused on searching for hidden objects. Some quests require a large amount of resources, and it is not hard to collect them, just tedious. On the other hand, in my opinion, hidden objects in this game are much easier to find than in the previous part. I still remember how I searched for mushrooms in Hero of the Kingdom - it was a nightmare and I almost hate mushrooms now! In Hero of the Kingdom II I managed to find all items much faster.\n\nI still do not understand what is the meaning of artifacts. To find these items, you need to complete a relatively long quests (I mean - "long" for this simple and short game), then you will get achievement and... that is all. I did not find any use for artifacts. Why this items are in game, can they be used somehow? I have no answer.\n\nWell. Can I recommend this game? Probably, yes. I must warn you: Hero of the Kingdom II will not hold you for a long time, it is a short easy adventure for a couple of hours, nothing more. Still, it is a decent casual game, that is for sure.","April 12","true","7.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/346560/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","I vaguely remember playing through Hero of the Kingdom about a year ago. It was a blast of casual RPG adventure and I played it through in a couple of evenings. The second instalment is best described to the players of the original game by "more of the same": Light-hearted adventuring in a fantasy-lite setting, being a goody-goody adventurer who has great deeds in his near future. I'd roll in a casual take on the hidden object genre as well.\n\nStoryline is also fairly similar to the original: the protagonist has basically lost everything but he's an honest, hard-working dude so he's not complaining and instead just starts getting stuff done. Then everything goes down the drain again and he has to go save not only his sister but basically the whole civilized world. Being the embodiment of righteousness he's going to help every beggar, farmer and sovereign along the way, even the shady kinds because of "the greater good".\n\nGame mechanics are also familiar. To do stuff the protagonist has a bunch of properties like health, fame and money that he uses to get the dirty business done. Most of the work you can do is clearly shown on the map, and this includes talking to people, trading or doing quests. Usually business takes its toll in the form of reducing health, tools or some of the items the protagonist hoards and hauls around everywhere he goes. You will learn that, controversially, eating different foods and sleeping in quirky places makes you stronger. You've also got abilities (like fishing or foraging) and areas of knowledge (like pearl diving) that allow you to do more stuff on the map if you've got the right tools.\n\nThe areas of knowledge allow you to play a kind of hidden object minigame. Take the example of the pearl diving: when you learn it, a bunch of seashells with pearls inside them appear in the water areas. Clicking them gets you pearls. Unlike quests, these are not highlighted but they also don't require any additional tools to collect. Merciful for achievement hunters, there are always couple more than required of each object on the map.\n\nWhen doing dirty business, all that is required is that you have enough health, money and whatever else is required for the quest. There's otherwise no chance of failure (but your tools sometimes break afterwards). Because of this the story can progress at a fast pace. I think I only had a short pause on progression when I found that I could break the economy by producing ridiculous amounts of flour and later lumber and trade them for surplus gold. The resulting several thousand gold coins made sure that I didn't need to care much about money for the rest of the game.\n\nIt took me couple of evenings, i.e. about 6.5 hours to finish the game and find everything for the achievements. I had to keep it rolling for a couple of extra hours for the last cards.\n\nHero of the Kingdom 2, like its predecessor, is really a game of happy thoughts. Curious how being a fictional goody-goody guy is able to arouse a nice, warm feeling inside of you. Both games would probably work well playing with a child, even more so if they can read. While I got mine on sale I would even recommend this game for the full price: that's how nice it was.","July 25, 2015","true","9.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Don't be fooled, this is not movement kind of game like Fallout, Diablo or similar, but point and click adventure, where options are mostly presented on screen. Charming addition is that not ALL of the options are presented and almost every screen has secret options and hidden objects. Which is neat, I completely like that about Hero of the kingdom 1.\n\nWhen I played it to the end I instantly searched similar games but those I found weren't exactly like HOTK1 so i gave it a rest. I was so glad that i stumbled upon sequel seaarcing for some casual thing to play. It is still great game but I kinda miss some things from orignial...\n\nPros (compared to first one):\n+ a bit longer than first one\n+ more diversity in the begining, and multiple ways to solve something (although probably multiple ways to get stuck as well)\n+ has interior maps\n+ more skills and hidden object types\n+ maybe better story (but it is nothing special)\n\nCons (now i really wished that they really correct these in third, because i will pay double price just to play these kind of game, and there is really no reason not to correct these in small and charming game like this):\n- story is still too short, too shallow for fantasy kind of game\n- game is mostly text driven, relying on lines of text, immersing player into the world etc... but dialogue is still missing from game, or maybe better dialogue system where we really see chat instead of bubbles of text with "ok" on them\n- reused graphics - ok, not that big deal, but they literally used everything they had in original\n- i think they removed upgrading of skills (like hunting etc), for no good reason, so what you see is what you get now\n- while i found that first one had lot of new things and opened new genre of games, here i don't get that feeling. And while I played original twice just to get all those hidden boxes and eggs, and achievements, here I kind lack that feeling of replayability. Probably becouse of next fact that is...\n- no new content (almost at all)\n\nBut it is still great and charming game for own price. Not to mention that it was made by only 3 people and those who made music I believe.","February 22, 2015","true","7.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

This game is suitable for gamers of all ages and should have no problems running on virtually any system due to the minimal CPU usage. The storyline is well written and the hand-drawn graphics are amazing for the price.\n\nOne of the best things about a casual game like this is that it can be loaded up quickly when you only have a small amount of time to spend gaming and want to have a little fun. The overall gameplay is very enjoyable and even at full price this game is worth picking up.\n\nThe Good:\n=======+  Beautiful artwork\n+  Great storyline\n+  Playable on almost any PC\n+  Steam achievements & trading cards\n+  No bugs or crashes\n+  Affordably priced for almost any gaming budget\n+  Combines several gaming genres to maximize appeal\n+  Quality ambient background sounds and music\n\nThe Bad:\n======-  Quests and goals feel repetitive which can lead to boredom\n-  Low replay value aside from Steam achievements\n-  Simplistic gameplay that fails to challenge the player\n-  Short game\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n===========Hero of the Kingdom 2 is not going to get your adrenaline pumping or test your gaming reflexes and skills, Its not supposed to. That's what is meant by casual gaming and as a casual game it is a remarkable title that still offers a lot of gaming pleasure at a bargain price. I enjoyed playing this title and would recommend everyone to pick up a copy for their gaming library.\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","February 26, 2015","true","9.9"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","16","23","0","0"

What a great follow up in the series.\n\nI spent the day on and off playing Hero of the Kingdom 2 and thoroughly enjoyed my time on it. Once again I finished this game in around 6 hours inclusive of all achievements. The game surprisingly improved a lot when you took the time to look at it closely. No constant back tracking, solid progression and minimal "glass walls".\n\nComparatively to the first game the money making options were improved, skills no longer advanced with training but new additions were added. A larger variety of challenges (easy of course but variety is nice). New and varied locations. Lastly, a little less cheesy towards the end but still fairly cheesy.\n\nOnce again if I had to identify flaws, the lack of replay ability (in my opinion). The difficulty being too easy and possibly the simplicity of the story line and how by the numbers it is. I wouldn't hold that last one against the game though. It sets out to delivery another easy but enjoyable point and click / RPG / adventure game that is geared towards simple fun more than anything else.

It took me 4,5 hours to get to the end, then I went for the achievements and also completed them very fast as you can see.\n\nIn the first part it was just a small world to explore if you compare it to this one. It took me more time to learn all the skills, so I had to go several times to the same place, first to pick mushrooms, then to find eggs etc. Just before the end, when I got achievements for finding a lot of eggs, and killing lots of wild animals, I noticed that when I got the master achievement, there still were some eggs to find (probably other stuff too, but I noticed the eggs). In the first part, when you got the master achievement there weren't any eggs left, so that's a little change. Nice for when you're short on money.\n\nThe whole map was used in a nice way, land above and islands below. The storyline was a bit better than the first one in which you had to defeat an evil wizard to save the kingdom. This time I had to find my sister, I found her and also my brother who left a long time ago, but got possessed by the devil and became a pirate because of that. Then I got a wizard by my side and had to defeat that devil and its creatures.\n\nAs opposed to the first part it was a lot harder to obtain the items needed, because during the first part I created the habit of selling almost everything I had, since I wasn't going to use it anymore. Due to that "bad" habit I often had money problems during important (and expensive) missions, but I made it!\n\nJust as its first part it's just a game to play when you have spare time and you don't know what to do with it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tinyturtle/recommended/346560/","tinyturtle","Tiny Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tinyturtle/","870 products in account","Hero of the Kingdom II is a very casual and relaxed game. There's no stress, no time limits and no 'action' to speak of. It's entirely based around economic puzzles; gathering resources in many forms and bringing them together to progress. Some you need to spend, others stay with you. It's simple enough, with the real test being the ability to remember where and how to get what you need. For an example, remembering how to get hay when later in the game you end up needing some for a cow's bedding. -- And yes, that's about how the average quest goes. You'll be slaying monsters as well, but you do it in the exact same manner. "Now where can I get a shield, a mercenary and a torch to slay a giant spider?"\n\nEven then, it's fun. It's very genuinely fun. I do need to warn you that the story, writing and dialogue are all awful. Sorry! :( I don't mean that as an insult to the developer, it's just the whole world doesn't show an ounce of actual creative thinking. It's a cookie-cutter save-the-girl quest in a cookie-cutter fantasy kingdom in which you face cookie-cutter pirates. If you want a story, avoid this game like the plague. If you want a chill, casual, resource-driven puzzle game, dude, go nuts. It's totally worth it.","February 26, 2015","true","7.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It’s an inferior sequel, but still a damn fun indie game.\n\nLong version:Hero of the Kingdom was one of the surprise indie hits of the recent years: a game that combined the classic adventure formula with hidden object mechanics and resource management. Mostly the latter, because the goal was always the same: use your current stocks to gather enough of the specified resources to pass the current objectives.\nThe second game didn’t change anything about this formula, it only tried to tweak it a little with small things like unlocking all skills and the city early to avoid the constant backtracking.\n\nStill, it somehow misses the soul of the original. Everything feels a little worse. The plot is more amateurish. There is no real progression, you can just visit almost entire map right away– which is significantly smaller, despite the inclusion of in-door sub-maps. There are no side-stories; people just dump their sub-quests on you as soon as you enter an area.\n\nI’m not saying the game is bad; Hero of the Kingdom II is a very enjoyable indie game worth every penny.

I'm not sure if it is possible to "lose" this game, although it is possible to complete without getting all of the achievements. (A few of the point and click spots are teeny tiny items and not the bold yellow icons) I say it is impossible to lose because you can usually buy and sell all needed items - the only way I could picture someone getting "stuck" is if they converted everything to gold and used it at the Inn to sleep, converting it all to "Strength" hearts. And who knows - the author might have thought of this and provided a way to refresh your gold or raw material supplies. (I know the King did offer me extra gold at one point).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kittara_mirrou/recommended/346560/","Kittara_mirrou","Kittara Mirrou{{WaR}}","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kittara_mirrou/","307 products in account","The sequel to Hero of the Kingdom that was released in 2013, Hero of the Kingdom 2 takes much of the same formulae as the original had, and improves upon them. For those not familiar with the first, Hero of the Kingdom takes the Hidden Object formula, and mixes it with RPG and Adventure to make a nice casual experience that allows the player to experience the game with little to no pressure. Allowing you to either sit down and clear through the game in one sitting, or to boot up and play the game when you have a little free time. Anyway, on with the breakdown analysis!\n\n\n=Complete Review=  (TL:DR version and Conclusion at the bottom)\n\n=The Story: 3/5= The game starts with the protagonist and their sister wandering the countryside, looking for a place to call home. Their family, and their old home, were destroyed by a earthquake, with them being the only survivors of the event. They are found by a kindly old man, who takes them in and brings them to the fishing village he lives at. After running a couple errands, he comes back to the village only to find that pirates are raiding the village, and holding his sister captive. But before he can get close enough to his sister, he is knocked out.\n\nHe wakes up, only to find the pirates gone, and a couple of the townspeople badly injured. A trip to the nearby herbalist provides him with a couple potions necessary to tend to the wounded. Once he knows the townspeople are well, he sets out to find a boat in order to chase after the notorious pirates who have captured his sister.\n\nJust like the first game, the storyline is that of a rescue mission. But, It has enough differences to it that it's not a sort of cut-and-dry copy of the original. The original is only referenced through a bit of obscure dialogue, so one could play this game without even needing to play the first.\n\n=The User Interface: 2/5= Same as the first game, as they yet again took a minimalistic approach. But I do suppose it works for the formula they went for, so I suppose they opted to not fix what wasn't broken, and instead put their resources to the art and gameplay. But fortunately, this means those familiar with the first game, will find absolutely no issue in navigating the UI.\n\n=The Gameplay: 3/5= Very similar to the last game, but there's definitely some improvement here. There's actual multiple ways to make profits should you run out of things that would be obvious to sell, as opposed to the single and extremely slow method in the first game. There is also other islands to explore, as opposed to a single landmass. There's also a new skill you can unlock, which is the ability to pick locks. Which is quite nice.\n\nBut, aside from that, things are relatively similar to the last game. In that you'll unlock new things to find as you learn new skills, of which these new things will spawn or activate throughout the world once you learn the skill, requiring a bit of backtracking to find everything. And interaction is done solely with a mouse, to click on objects to collect, exclaimation points to trigger quests, and on creatures to fight, so long as you've the items to fulfill the requirements.\n\n=The Graphics: 3/5= The graphics are well executed, everything containing a sort of consistant style so as to not make things look completely out of place, but also not blending completely in to the background. This can make things look as though they fit in their environment, but not insanely hard to find as well. Which is a problem I've seen quite a few Hidden Object games have.\n\nAll the art resources are also made by the staff working on the game, which is another such thing that I've seen games of the HOG genre cut corners on. So definite kudos to the artists of Lonely Troops.\n\n=The Audio: 3/5= The music is quite nice, fitting the settings well. Obviously it's not the kind of music that one'll get hooked on, but it's definitely good to listen to for the duration that one is playing for. Sounds will also play depending on what is in the current view of the area, so you will definitely hear the difference between a bustling city full of people, and a forest stocked with wildlife and boar to hunt.\n\n=TL;DR/Pros & Cons=\nPros\n- Storyline is simple, akin to the first. A mission to rescue your sister!\n- Easy to play casual gameplay.\n- Graphics are well done, and don't look out of place.\n- Music and sounds that fit the location.\n- More ways to make money than the last game.\n- Good amount of Achievements.\n\nNeutral\n- Minimalistic UI as in the first game.\n- Game is very casual, making it a boon for those who like it that way, and a strike against it for ones looking for more from their experience.\n\nCons\n- Game is short, just like the first game.\n- Even more backtracking than the last.\n- Little to no replay value.\n\n=The Conclusion: 6.5/10=  It doesn't try to be groundbreaking or something overly different, it settles in to it's own element peacefully, while making improvements over the formula set by the first. It doesn't try to bring too much to the table like I've seen happen in other sequels, and what it does offer runs smoothly with absolutely no glitches or bugs. All in all, it's a enjoyable little game, and good to play for both people new to this series of games, and those playing this one after the first.\n\nI hear a third game is in the works already, and I'm sure that it will improve more over the formula as this one has. And I'll have to be sure to pick it up myself to play once it's released. But for now.... Thank you very much for taking your time to read my review~!\n","January 19","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I played the first one, it took a bit getting used to, but being able to move all over the map with a few clicks makes going back and forth to get things to solve a quest so much easier than any 3D adventure game where you have to walk or run to get around.\n\nJust like its predecessor, your progression through the game is relatively linear, and though it is not strictly speaking necessary to win the game, it does give one a certain extra satisfaction gaining all the achievements, which is possible to complete after reaching the winning conditions of your main quest and storyline. Judging from the global statistics, rather a high number of players actually choose to complete all achievements, which is an achievement for the game's creators.\n\nSpeaking of story, it is your typical slightly clicheed fantasy adventure story, where even the twists are hardly surprising, though a nice touch to what would otherwise be a bit too predictable. Still, its familiarity makes the game a bit more casual, which suits it nicely.\n\nLike in the first instalment of the series, a bit of bartering might be necessary to reach the funds needed to achieve all goals. I assume that hardly anyone plays this without having played the first one before, and so I'll not say any more particulars about the game mechanics.\n\nI felt that what you had to do in this game, though of course similar to the first one, was sufficiently different to make it feel fresh and fun again for the 4 hours or so that is needed to complete the game. My playtime ended up being a bit longer as the game was left on when I was AFK, and also I had to find those last hard-to-spot eggs and lost crates to complete my Steam achievements as I was so close at the end of the game I thought I might as well.\n\nComing from a 1920x1080 15 inch display laptop, I felt that the things you had to find were slightly easier to spot in this one than in the first game. Perhaps a tad bigger or clearer, whereas the individual blue mushrooms of game one left me looking a bit longer.\n\nAll in all, this game was more similar than different from its older brother, and think that's a good thing. It dares to be different, and manages to go against the trend of over-production that has crippled the gameplay of some adventure games over the last few decades, though it is by no means retro in its use of graphics as there are hardly any visible pixels in sight.\n\nThe simplicity of its user interface might seem to belong to a different era, but I think it makes for highly playable and enjoyable minimalism, making a game that I feel is well worth the ticket price.","April 29, 2015","true","6.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Judging from the global statistics, rather a high number of players actually choose to complete all achievements, which is an achievement for the game's creators.\n\nSpeaking of story, it is your typical slightly clicheed fantasy adventure story, where even the twists are hardly surprising, though a nice touch to what would otherwise be a bit too predictable. Still, its familiarity makes the game a bit more casual, which suits it nicely.\n\nLike in the first instalment of the series, a bit of bartering might be necessary to reach the funds needed to achieve all goals. I assume that hardly anyone plays this without having played the first one before, and so I'll not say any more particulars about the game mechanics.\n\nI felt that what you had to do in this game, though of course similar to the first one, was sufficiently different to make it feel fresh and fun again for the 4 hours or so that is needed to complete the game. My playtime ended up being a bit longer as the game was left on when I was AFK, and also I had to find those last hard-to-spot eggs and lost crates to complete my Steam achievements as I was so close at the end of the game I thought I might as well.\n\nComing from a 1920x1080 15 inch display laptop, I felt that the things you had to find were slightly easier to spot in this one than in the first game. Perhaps a tad bigger or clearer, whereas the individual blue mushrooms of game one left me looking a bit longer.\n\nAll in all, this game was more similar than different from its older brother, and think that's a good thing. It dares to be different, and manages to go against the trend of over-production that has crippled the gameplay of some adventure games over the last few decades, though it is by no means retro in its use of graphics as there are hardly any visible pixels in sight.\n\nThe simplicity of its user interface might seem to belong to a different era, but I think it makes for highly playable and enjoyable minimalism, making a game that I feel is well worth the ticket price.","April 29, 2015","true","6.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You help out anyone you can and learn about the village, and people there.\n\n\nThe game does a great job with art and sound.  However, there were some times when I felt “stuck” and not able to move forward in the story.  This was because there are things that you can pick up, but you really need to look for them.  Things like crates, grains, and other trinkets scattered around the world.\n\n\nSee my full review here\nhttp://tiger-game-reviews.blogspot.ca/2015/02/hero-of-kingdom-2.html","February 20, 2015","true","2.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

It is basically a point and click puzzle game in a fantasy setting where you also have an inventory.  Almost all actions are instantly successful as long as you have the resources needed to complete the action, be it health or other resources.  There is little in the way of trading for profit though you can refine some items for profitable trade, but most of those take quite some time to actually make a good profit.\n\nThere is little in the way of replayability as the first time through you find most everything.  Camping is one of the biggest time sinks in the game as you will need to keep bringing your health back up.\n\nAs for the story it is a generic story and as an RPG it is a non-starter, but as a point and click aventure type game it is probably one of the best that I have ever played.  If you like the point and click adventure type games this one is a good one in a fantasy type setting.  The main difference is that it is 3rd person instead of a first person.  Think something along the lines of "Where's Waldo" and you will understand what the game play is like.","February 22, 2015","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I never played the original game of the series, but I don't feel like I missed anything by skipping it. You might enjoy this game especially if you enjoy point and click puzzle games, but also if you like resource management mixed with a decently written story.\n\nThe game started off slow and I was worried the game would be too simple for me for to enjoy. However, after the game familiarizes you with the controls, your options expand and the real puzzle/resource-management begins. The game is divided into about a dozen main locations with several side-locations, such as caves and basements, that each have people in need of help or monsters in need of slaying. Monsters, as well as all quests, simply require you to possess a certain amount of items that you'll find through exploring or bartering. Many of the actions available to you are highlighted with buttons, but many resources are simply lying on the ground for you to find and harvest. Only rarely were the non-highlighted items difficult to spot, but I wouldn't be surprised if you missed out on one or two quests. You can never really miss a quest opportunity as it's available to you even after you complete the main story.\n\nYou'll quickly get into the flow of how to manage your resources and it did become a small grind for me. Thankfully, when I started losing interest, I saw the checkered finish line straight ahead and wrapped up the game nicely. The achievements were a breeze to get, but it did add some extra playability to an overall short and easy game.\n\nI received this game in a Humble Bundle and hadn't heard of it prior to purchase. I'm glad I gave it a shot and I hope you can find the game on sale sometime soon as well.","October 29, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You collect items and when you have enough of certain items then you finish the quest and move on.\n\nAs it is more of the same then if you loved the first game, you will enjoy this one as well.

If you like casual adventure games then you will find about 5 to 7 hours of enjoyment here. Bottom line: Pick this game up if your looking for something to mindlessly occupy your time for a lazy afternoon.\n\nJust like Hero of the Kingdom 1, HotK2 (that acronym sound like some BA skis) is a click your own adventure. This time around the there is more crafting, more collectibles, more quests, and infinitely more clicking. I have to be honest, the clicking is ridiculous! Example 1: Some of the game is a lite version of hidden object where you have to find say, eggs. You click the eggs, an animation shows the eggs being taken, then an icon of the eggs appear and you must then click the icon of the eggs to obtain them. Given the fact there are about 1,000 hidden objects in the game that's 2,000 clicks you have to do! That's just one example. Most tasks within HotK2 requires 2 to 4 clicks to complete. This was a problem in the first game, only it feels like it's gotten worse. This is probably due to the extended length of the game.\n\nThe writing has improved over HotK1. Now instead of the storyline reading like it was written by a 12 year old boy and edited by a 6 year old girl, it's more like a 16 year old boy wrote it and was edited by a 14 year old girl. Grammar has improved. Spelling errors were down. The general story was more in-depth. However, like I said, it's still juvenile, just less primary school. There will be no awards for storytelling here, but you'll be less apt to skip over all the story as in before.\n\nThe game as a whole is fun! The constant clicking, predictable story aside, HotK2 has a way of pulling you in and making you want to complete every facet of it. I grabbed this up for $3. For 7 hours playtime with 100% achievements, I feel like it was a good investment. If you're looking for something that can waste away a rainy day, you've found it.","September 12, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The peaceful music, intuitive interface, and beautiful graphics all make for a pleasing, casual game experience with no time stress. There is no loading and saving of games because it doesn't need it - you only have one game in progress and it's saved after any action (changing areas, buying or selling, etc.). As far as i can determine, it's next to impossible to get it into a state where one neither has no can obtain more money, and thereby gets stuck. This edition is larger than part 1, but in terms of map size and things to do, but is, in terms of usage/play, identical except that this one includes some underground areas which do not show up on the world map. The continual back-and-forth between the islands and the town, for fighting supplies, got a bit tedious/annoying, but didn't go on for too awful long. If you enjoyed part 1 and want more of the same, grab this. If neither of those apply, don't.","August 22, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically it's one long string of fetch quests, with some automated "combat" in between. It's mostly a sort of item-finding/resource-management game... sort of. I'm not really sure what to call it, nor do I consciously know what to think of it.\nThe fact I finished it in two sittings though, suggests I had a good time and it was at the very least addictive.","May 22","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

These games are like a story that unfolds at your own pace. Here you won't find a lot of the structure you usually find in games like levels, time-based quests, the need to restart something... The challenge is to explore your surroundings in the best way possible with the resources you have, and work out your trades, purchases ans sales so you always keep the quests flowing. This makes for a very casual, fun and relaxing game, I really enjoyed playing both this one and the previous title.\n\nIt seems that the type of game Hero of the Kingdom I and II are is kind if a new thing around. In the forums, people were asking each other for similar games but none was found. Props to the devs then, for making something so good and that wasn't out there already. Really looking forward to HotK III.","May 26","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Searching for items is made fun, little quests, not-so-hard bargaining to have enough cash. May be a little repetitive if you play it five times in a row which I didn't, but I still keep it for a rainy day. How this simple game still gave me a few shivers of serenitude amaze me!","May 30","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You started out simple, and each time, you got a little more to do. Here, you very quickly get A LOT OF stuff, meaning you won't really find or familiarize yourself with anything. Quests left unfinished, and a sudden surge in gold needed (to buy a ship, or kill two dozen zombies, including maces, shields, blue potions, and a few soldiers). It leaves you uneasy.\n\nIn the end, this still has all the qualities of Hero of the Kingdom 1, and is a good game, but if you play this after part 1, you'll come home to a cold shower. I do not recommend it to those players. If you can get this game first, enjoy it, fall in love with it, then play part 1, and it'll probably feel like a warm familiar blankey on a chilly day, sitting on the front porch with a cold one.
