A little different, but different is definitely good.  It reminds me of when I was younger and get a new game, like Darklands, Dark Sun, Wiz 7, or Realms of Arkania, and I had to take my time and figure out the rules and not know what was going to happen.  We have kind of been indoctrinated now to know our hands will be held and we can just click through everything or not worry about the character development system because gimping your character is impossible and combat is mindless.  This game gives me that feeling I had when I was younger and installed a new crpg and I knew it was meaty and I had to think and plan and take my time to figure things out.\n\nGraphics are not the best, but the gameplay and mechanics more than make up for it.\n\nRtwP combat almost always sucks, but isn't too bad in this game.  I think it is done a lot better than Pillars of Eternity and the IE games at least.\n\nI give it an 8/10 since it doesn't have TB combat.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who likes real crpgs in general; anyone who liked the Infinity Engine games or NWN; or, for more recent examples, anyone who liked Pillars of Eternity, D:OS, M&MX, or WL2.\n\n\nEDIT:  Just some more information on the game.  It has old school puzzles, such as from the original Quest for Glory 1 and 2 (where you had to type all commands), where you have an object in game that you know does something, but you have no idea how to go about getting it to do what it was made to do.  For instance, (slight spoiler ahead) there is a ring of purple flowers.  If you use your woodlore skill on it you find that a fairy is trapped inside by magic.  There is a linguistic system where you type a prefix, power word, and the object of the spell.  This system may have an effect on it, or not.  Or maybe you need two skill points in linguistics?  Who knows?  Not me.  It could be something completely different.  I would have said yesterday I love things like this where you have to think and put your brain against the game, but I'm finding I'm a lot more impatient than I was when I first played QfG and this game is making me feel stupid.  And there are no walkthroughs.  I do think this is a great aspect of the game, but I kind think it is also kind of infuriating.  I'm kind of obsessive and I am having a real hard time leaving the first outside area because there are two things I haven't been able to figure out.\n\nIf I were normal I would just add some notes in the jounral and come back later, but I'm not, and after work I plan on showing these puzzles who is boss.  Sadly, there is a good chance I'm not the boss.   though.","May 28, 2015","true","19.6"," 167 of 183 people (91%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","91","167","183","10","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/335120/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","These days, even mere mortals are more than awesome enough to do everything in spectacular fashion. Take Skyrim for example, everybody needs your help, you always have the capabilities to solve every task, and within hours you become strong enough to singlehandedly kill dragons. Along with this unparalleled power, players enjoyed countless luxuries, such as dozens of quest indicators, as well as arrows that point out exactly where to go and who to talk to. Serpent in the Staglands takes an approach that gamers have either long forgotten, or never even knew existed.\n\nYou are the all-powerful Moon Lord, or were I should say. Someone or something has trapped you in the mortal realm. When you start off, all you're given are some directions, papers identifying you as a merchant, and the assistance of a few allies. Before long, you will face your first great adversary, a wolf. Starting off in this game reminds me of the first Baldur's Gate. In that RPG, you started off at level 1, and even the weakest creatures led to life or death struggles. In the beginning of my adventure, I summoned an ethereal ally, and requested the help of a couple of others. Our party of four was no match for a few wolves.\n\nWe all need a little help sometimes, but this game won't provide any. Aside from the always handy ability to save anywhere , you're on your own. Actually, I take that back. You're also given a journal so you can jot down any and all notes. Yes, if you come across a quest, you should write it down along with all pertinent information, because you might forget. Another aspect to keep in mind is that alongside combat and magic skills, there are also certain talents you should be training. With up to five party members, there is room to specialize, so you'll want someone that can speak to nobles, another that will brew potions, the one guy who can understand old texts, and so on. As you explore the Staglands, you'll meet others willing to join your "cause". It's worth swapping allies around, as they can have better stats as well as mastery of different skill-sets. Failing to do this could have disastrous results.\n\nSpeaking of disastrous results, early on combat can be especially difficult. Like Baldur's Gate, this game employs a "real-time with pausing" system. By pressing the space bar, you can pause everything, giving you ample time to issue orders, prepare spells, and pray to the RNG deities. One of the main aspects where Serpent in the Staglands differentiates itself, is in the magic system. Spell-casting is infinite; you are not limited by points nor the need to rest and recharge. However, there is a charge time for everything, and most spells require that you maintain the cast, possibly for the duration of the battle. This simplifies things somewhat, since you can designate one of your party-members as "the tank" and channel all of your healing and stat-boosting spells to them. However, just because it's easy to learn spells, won't make you effective casters. If the enemies are too strong, the spells will fail to do anything. In fact, I've seen some of my foes not even notice my presence, despite everyone in my party channeling curses at them.\n\nYou'll likely find yourself relying on physical combat. Each party-member is capable of learning several combat techniques, although only three can actually be used at a time. These arts of war "proc" after so many swings of a sword or firings of a crossbow. With the right combination of party members and skills, you can do more damage as well as inflict numerous debilitating effects on your foes. In my play-through, I had two characters using shield-bash. This skill can knock enemies down for a couple seconds. There wasn't much the toughest enemy could do against this onslaught. All skills are strengthened via points incurred upon leveling up. As with AD&D, level-ups are few and far between, so you have to make the most of them. By the time I completed the game, my level had barely crossed into the double-digits.\n\nThere are other methods for dealing with hostility. Traps can be set to damage as well as impede enemy forces. This is all but required for handling the dreaded crawlers, who can kill party-members in 1-2 hits. Most enemies can also be lured out with ranged weapons or curses, in case your party can only handle one at a time. Admittedly, I've also foregone the pleasantries and sought the first strike when dealing with some people. There are a few crowds of bandits who attack all at once after a short verbal exchange. Rather than get torn to pieces by archers, I lured everyone out one at a time with missile weapons of my own. It's a cheap method, but considering how heavily the odds are stacked in the game's favor...\n\nBringing up a party from nothing, and the growing pains that go along with it, is one of the more compelling aspects of this game. The story is mostly in the background, and you might find yourself stumbling over plot-important NPCs in unlikely places. Most of your vacation in the horrid Staglands, will be spent exploring, getting a feel for the world, and using your talents to find solutions for various side-quests. There is a strong element of non-linearity, and play-throughs can be pretty different from one another, depending on how you handle every situation. I've noticed that my lack of diplomacy and understanding of foreign languages has led to a number of closed-doors. There is a sizable population of natives inhabitating the peninsula, but if you can't speak their language, then it's just more enemies to do battle with.\n\nStill, there are moments that I can only describe as "lovingly obtuse". Certain events will happen, and you'll get to thinking that there's more to the story, but nothing comes of it. It's difficult to explain without resorting to spoilers, but let's just say that not all threads will resolve in a suitable fashion. There are also a couple puzzles where you will struggle with game mechanics (such as placing objects on pressure-plates). It helps to pay attention to the notes you acquire. Keep in mind also that something can be useless in the area you acquire it, but could be relevant in a location several miles away. There are actually not that many conversations to be had in this game. Most of the settlers aren't interested in gossip, and the dialogue trees have few (if any) branches. Sometimes you just have to read between the lines, and maybe fill in the blanks with whatever sounds good. On the bright side, the dialogue is well-done, and the bits of world-building are nicely handled.\n\nThe one major problem I have with this game is all the time spent staring at a loading screen. This can be especially grating early on, due to all the reloads caused by exceptionally squishy party-members. Serpent in The Staglands is also shockingly resource-heavy. The pixel-graphics have their charm, but there's nothing here that should demand such a large chunk of my PC's power. On the bright side, my adventure in the Staglands was mostly bug-free, with disappearing guards during some quicksaving shenanigans being the only outlier.\n\nWhile not without its faults, Serpent in the Staglands is an ambitious and engrossing RPG. Considering that it was developed by two people, I'm rather surprised it turned out as well as it did. The main quest is on the shorter side, but there are a number of ways to play through the game, and there's plenty of freedom in terms of character builds and party organization. An expansion is currently in-development, so fans can expect to see more of Vol eventually. All in all, this is a worthwhile title for genre veterans as well as players who tire of having everything handed to them.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","October 5, 2015","true","22.3"," 89 of 97 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","89","97","6","4"

One makes art that is in the same style of old 90s games aesthetically, and the other creates the assets/rules/codes like some wizard determined to bring out a really great game.\n\nFor the game itself; it is truly a throwback to the old immersive RPG's from the 90s, no quest markers, nothing to hold your hand and only you and your characters actual knowledge of what is around you. It treats you like a normal human, one with normal situational comprehension, deduction, forethought and reasoning.\n\nWriters for characters in videogame has most of the time complained that romances is the last thing they write, as it mostly reminds them of bad writing in literature. And it mostly is since it adds nothing to the depth of the character. You will see none of it in Serpent in the Staglands since it tries, like many non-romancable RPG's of the time - to be a respectable game.\n\nThe game has a classless system where you decide for yourself what you want your character to use or become, on its own it opens up many unique opportunities; to roleplay as someone else if that is your thing; since the game has a ton of skills to choose from. (I myself made a Castlevania-esque inspired vampire slayer - whip and all kinds of thrown stuff and holy magic). Like many old games it relies on the player to -be- their character, no logs to backtrack quest progress, no mystical magical map of the whole world that pinpoints your exact position or holding your hand towards your "next" location. It wants you to explore the world on your own, find letters, find someone elses journal/diary about what or where they were, mystical tomes of ancient knowledge, understanding why everyone is so hostile. By listening to what everyone has to say, everything is not what it seems and you really can't trust anyone and have to craft your story based on who you believe to speak the most truths; when every single character you meet in the game has some sort of agenda.\n\nIt's no wonder that this game is not vastly more popular amongst people, as it foregoes a lot of the common "comforts" of modern AAA rpg titles of letting the player think as little as possible or treat them as if they aren't intelligence enough to know what to do or where to go.\n\nThe ones who will love truly love this game are those that had to treck the harsh journeys that old games had, or feel like you are being undervalued in modern games and underestimates how much you truly know. There is a lot of reading involved and nothing to hold your hand and this causes it to lose out on people who seeks a more streamlined experience.","June 20, 2015","true","36.3"," 84 of 94 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","84","94","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightsod/recommended/335120/","nightsod","nightsod","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightsod/","186 products in account","Firstly, everything that you've read about this games opacity and difficulty is true. I never played Darklands, it's 'spiritual predecessor', but just about every other 16bit classic I have - including Ultima VII again, only recently.\n\nI liked: The setting, character and the writing of the game. At times knowing or literate or funny, and at others merely enjoyably silly. It felt like the strongest part of the game. I like the 'feel' of the low magic (even if it's less exciting to play, and it is.) The skills system is clever and would probably reward more play than I'm prepared to put into this game.\n\nSo what did I bounce off, given that list of positives? This game still feels very much like an alpha build, rushed to publishers demands, and incomplete. The feedback in the world is at times non-existent. I spent HOURS trying to figure out where a particular well was(a quest was pointing me at it.) in the first town. No text cues at all, you're meant to see a tiny altered graphic on the screen, and it clearly isn't MEANT to be obscure. Just one example, but that felt typical of the play experience.\nThe load times are just horrendous, and indicative of ineffecient coding and design - oh, and you'll be seeing the gratingly amateurish death and load screens a lot, almost as much as you'll be playing. This is as the combat is brutal and unforgiving, unknowingly encounter enemies for the first time and die. Again and again and again, till you start learning what the games systems.\nAnd BUGS. BUGS everywhere! sometimes game stopping. You can read about them all elsewhere.\n\nI find that now I just don't care enough, certainly not enough to have paid £15 to be a beta tester on a game. I am already sick of the game's flaws.\n\nThere's much to admire about this game and its creation, but unfortunately not as much to enjoy.","July 20, 2015","false","19.0"," 119 of 155 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","119","155","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/recommended/335120/","raixel","raixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/","495 products in account","TL:DR\nAnyone who loves isometric hardcore RPGS, this is the game for you! Its becoming one of my favs along with Lords of Xulima, PoE, D:OS and the classics like Planescape & Baldurs Gate. If you want handholding, go elsewhere. Its a little buggy right now, but it being patched as I type this, so I'll remove this line if it gets better.\n____________________________\nThis is possibly the coolest game Ive stumbled across recently since finding Lords of Xulima. I've been disparing as Steam slowly seems to be swallowed up by Google Play-esq crap casual mobile ports.\n\nNot this game. Its an RPG for RPG lovers. Its done in a pseudo-1990s (like 1995 or so) pixelated style, with cutscenes being done in something that looks very similar to that era's FMV. Its really great so far.\n\nIve played literally hundreds if not thousands of RPGs in my 34 years, and after a while they seem very similar. Elves, dwarves, halflings, forests and quests, deserts, dungeons, dragons etc etc ad naseum.\n\nWell this one starts out with an Ultima like fortune teller asking you questions. Then apparently, you are a god who got stuck in the mortal world and must take a mortal form. It then goes into character creation...and the races are all unique! No humans. No elves (pseudo or otherwise - they all have pointy ears, so maybe they're all elves?), no dwarves. Just unique races. Awesome. Even Pillars of Eternity didnt do it this well, as I would have called their races just a slightly different take on "traditional" races.\n\nHoping the rest of the game pans out as well as the little Ive seen so far. I'll be updating as I go.\n\nHm, so I started out, made two chars (this is a "create your own group or find NPCS" like PoE). I immediately found a book which allowed me to use the mouse to draw symbols on it. Cool, I love interactive stuff (The Room series is one of the few mobile games I'm into).  I screwed around and SOMEHOW drew the right symbol on the 4th try. Nice, but WTF.","June 7, 2015","true","18.6"," 43 of 46 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","43","46","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dymhsa/recommended/335120/","Dymhsa","Dymhsa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dymhsa/","283 products in account","A friendly reminder that taking on a pack of wolves with a kitchen knife, or single point in a first level spell is a bad idea.\n\nSerpent in the Staglands is a modern 'old-school' style crpg in both look and feel. Gone are the arrows of patronization, the quest log, the terrible bland puzzles that a brain dead toddler could figure out, and in is a true return to form of open world crpgs bursting at the seams with love and attention to detail. For a game made by a team of two people, it is one of the gaming masterworks of this decade in my eyes.\n\nThe Bad:\n1. At the time of playing, many small errors in displayed item statistics, skill descriptions, and other details were littered here and there. However, the new patches seem to be ironing out all of these typos and issues.\n\n2. Lack of sound variation is something that detracts from immersion in combat. There are painfully few sound effects for all the various spells and weapons. Two spells that have wildly different effects generally ought to have wildly different sounds, if sound is to be an integral feature to add to them.\n\n3. For those that love magic, know that it will take many points of investment to be an effective full time mage. It is simply part of the flavor of the setting, not necessarily a mark against the game, but it could put off those that chose this path for their first playthrough.\n\n4. The technical - loading times and video resolution - The loading times were very slow when I played through the game, making every death even more painful. Just because I want a crpg like those released in the late 90's doesn't mean I want a resolution like what they had. The game is beautiful but the constant close up feeling can wear on the senses after a while, at least for me.\n\nThe Good:\n1. The story is a simple, yet strong premise. You are a god somehow locked into the mortal coil possessing a flesh and blood avatar. If you die in your current form you will be swept out of existence like any other mortal. Your quest is to get home, while finding out who put you into this situation and exacting your vengeance if you wish.\n\n2. Incredibly sculpted world with a smorgasbord of lore that you can dig out with relatively little effort. The setting is dark, internally realistic, and all settlements and people are logically and lovingly placed. On many items, from the mundane to incredible artifacts, are paragraphs of flavor text to become immersed in.\n\n3. Almost all the quests are unique, memorable, can be done at any time, and usually have a myriad of solutions. Some solutions can have unforeseen consequences that tie into the world much more intricately than a simple "bumbleton reputation +5"\n\nAlso gone is the arrow of patronization, waypoints, or even a quest tracker. In SitS you have a journal in which you can manually write down all information you find relevant and wish to remember.\n\n4. There are a plethora of skills, both combat related and not, for crafting many different types of characters. The skills are separated into Combat Skills (or the War Book), Magic (the Spell Book), and Aptitudes. Combat and Magic skills are varied and all serve some purpose that can be exploited in game, even if some are much stronger than others. The Aptitudes are things ranging from Herbology, Nobility, and even Philosophy amongst others. All of these have uses beyond immediate combat benefit, allowing the player access to more dialogue options and other ways of overcoming obstacles. One great use for Philosophy involves befriending imps and using their malicious powers to steal stats from another character and gift them to the player permanently.\n\n5. Challenging puzzles. In too many games, especially in the last decade, the hardest puzzle is putting together that the '321' on the scrap of paper is the combination to the safe - or that mural on the wall displays the animals in the order that you need to put the emblems. Asinine busy work like that doesn't pass for puzzles in SitS. When the game presented me with a puzzle, I was deciphering the numerical code and language of an alien people. I was reading journals for the vaguest hints of a magical enchantment that required manipulating pillars of flame to cast their shadows to spell them out. These tasks pull you into the game world instead of the immersion breaking alternatives and minigames many games go with today.\n\n6. Quick, deadly combat. Ignore the people saying the game is insanely difficult. It's not. These people expect a mere mortal with little training to take on a wolf, or even pack of wolves, with a kitchen knife and consistently come out on top. The Damage dished out make fights generally short affairs. Having a party member knocked to the floor or stricken with magical fear can sour any battle into defeat. This applies equally to your enemy - knock an enemy down and watch your melee fighters smash them into jello in a laughable amount of time. Think tactically and use and trick you can to gain an upper hand.\n\nThe only complaint I have against the combat system is there being no zone of control. Enemies can merely walk past the fighters and into the back lines if they wish. This isn't so much a problem as long as you learn to engage with melee first, or set traps to effectively kite enemies easier.\n\n7. The sound design is top notch. Both music and sound effects are of great quality, if lacking in variety. The music that plays in the bogs is especially haunting.\n\n8. The art direction is absolutely amazing. Even though pixels and the 'neo-retro' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is old hat, the style of the game and the limits of having a two person studio do not work against the visual side of SitS.\n\nThe Great:\nThe entire game. I can't gush about it enough, but I've tried to present as unbiased an opinion I can over it. If you're still on the fence after watching trailers and reviews I'd say wait until more news of the planned expansion to see what that adds as well as what they've patched to the base game in the interim.","July 13, 2015","true","39.6"," 49 of 58 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","49","58","0","0"

The game's many areas are either stuffed with trash mobs (in the wilderness) or with nameless NPCs and empty houses (in the settlements). Unique NPCs and puzzles are relatively rare. Meanwhile, most side quests are bounty missions of the "go there, kill that" variety. As a consequence, exploration is rarely interesting or rewarding. There are still a number of bugs, including broken quests (a guy steals your license, but you can't steal it back because the pickpocket skill doesn't work on him -> you have to either murder the man or walk away). It's 10 months after release now, and I would expect these issues to be fixed by now.\n\nMost problematic, however, is the braindead combat, which is further exacerbated by an extremely imbalanced ruleset. Basically, you either equip your party with fast weapons, slap on a few flat damage bonuses, and watch them hack the enemy to bits, or you equip them with slow weapons and prepare for a long, boring slog. Either way, there is very little you can do to influence the battle once combat has begun; the developers describe this as\n\n"Combat designed for minimal pause spamming and without cooldowns, instead focusing on pre-buffing, positioning and auto-triggering skills."\n\nUnfortunately, the game's posititioning mechanics are not exactly complex (melee attackers in the front, ranged attackers in the back), and the other mechanics just lead to a hands-off, auto-combat playing experience. Combine that with a terribly boring magic system, where mages just stand around channelling buffs or healing spells throughout the entire battle, and the overall combat experience becomes soul-crushingly dull. I'd compare it to playing Baldur's Gate 1 with a party of only Fighters and Rangers, about 500% more filler monsters, and 10% of the unique NPCs. Rather hard to recommend.","March 21","false","28.1"," 33 of 40 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","33","40","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jarizleifr/recommended/335120/","jarizleifr","Jarizleifr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jarizleifr/","192 products in account","Serpent in the Staglands is an isometric RPG in the vein of classic party-based Infinity Engine titles such as Baldur's Gate, coupled with an enthralling pixelated aesthetic. The execution of the story reminds me of Fallout 1. You're thrown into the world with nothing but a small idea of where to go, the rest is up to you.\n\nI've always had a soft spot for RPGs such as Morrowind and Albion that take place in unique, weird and mysterious settings. Something that takes a leap away from the more established Tolkienesque/D&D derivative worlds with all the same tropes appearing from title to title.\n\nSerpent in the Staglands is one of these more unique titles, set in the world of Vol, inspired by late bronze age Transylvania. Giant lichen and moss cover the landscape. It has a certain frontier feeling to it, with conflicts between the settlers, the natives and the environment itself. The game is filled with surprisingly detailed lore, from history to politics. Even the item descriptions are interesting to read through, given how alien the world of Vol is.\n\nWhen I first started the game, I did the mistake of not reading the manual and starting with just one avatar. The combat is absolutely brutal even with a full party, so I ended up restarting the game with a full party of five people after 3-4 hours of gameplay. Magic is interesting, spells can be cast indefinately since there is no memorization or mana, but they take some time to prepare instead and can be interrupted by enemies. As such, mages seem to be much better suited to support roles. Leveling pace reminds me of the original Baldur's Gate. Your characters are utter weaklings in the beginning, but just getting from level 1 to 2 almost doubles your combat prowess. Be prepared to pick your fights early on.\n\nThe game has no automatic quest logging, so you have to write your own log entries instead in order to keep track of the quests you were given.\n\nI don't mind the unforgiving combat, but frequent dying combined with excruciating loading times is frustrating. Almost every combat situation has a possibility of going completely awry, forcing you to reload and go through the loading screen that can take half a minute. It breaks the pacing of the game and gets annoying very quickly.\n\nThe user interface was a bit confusing at the beginning, but you get used to it quickly. My grievances are with the problems brought by the retro aesthetic, for example save game names can have only 16 characters at max, which makes it hard making up descriptive names for saves while still staying under the character limit. The same problem persists when writing notes in the journal, you can't really do much with only about 200 characters. Granted, you could just write that stuff on paper, but since the writable journal is a feature in the game, it feels a bit lazy argument.\n\nI'd still wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who feels hungry for an old-school RPG experience in a unique, different setting. Serpent in the Staglands is a beautiful game with a lot to offer, but it suffers from broken pacing caused by long loading times.","October 12, 2015","true","22.2"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","0"

The disagreement comes on whether or not this game is a spirtual predecessor to "The Darklands" a much loved and hyped classic early 90's crpg.\n\nI can be about as pretentious and retro-biased as anyone and it pains me to say this but I have a confession to make. I hated Darklands. I understand it gets tons of love from fellow old man gamers and in a way I get it but I just couldn't find much enjoyment in the title personally. The exception being an appreciation for the insane amount of detail that goes into character builds/profeciencies in that game. Regardless I was still bored to tears the first time I tried to play (I must have been 12 or 13). About two years ago a friend of mine convinced me to give it a second try and I pushed and pushed myself to beat the main quest hoping to find something worth liking....and zilch on the fun factor. I was excited when this came out but held off on it until this week because I saw so many comparisons to darklands so I thought I would throw my 2 cents in the mix on the topic.\n\nArtwork and setting are really the only two things I found to be similiar between the dark and the stag.

I get that it's supposed to be a hard game, but why does it have to be so difficult to figure out how to play the game?  The interface feels very unintuitive for a CRPG with very little in the way of useful information presented to you.  To add to this, there's not much in-game help to explain what you're doing so you kinda have to fumble around and likely die or completely restart several times before you figure out what's going on.\n\nThere's supposed to be in game tool-tips (as seen in the options menu) but unless I'm doing something wrong, they never actually pop up on anything useful.  I don't know if that's a bug or not, but it's really frustrating having to open up my spell book every time I want to read what a certain quick cast spell does.  For that matter, I still don't know what that small bar of quick skills do.  I feel like if I knew these things I wouldn't be dying so much.  When any character falls in battle, they're permanently dead.  If the game were a little more intuitive I could welcome such an unforgiving difficulty, but as it stands, it's just cumbersome having to constantly save and reload.\n\nOne of the more baffling things in this game are mages.  For the life of me I can't figure out why anyone would cast spells in combat.  It feels incredibly clunky to try to cast anything in battle due to the awkwardly long cast time and how seemingly useless most of the spells are.  The only spell I've gotten any use out of is the healing spell, but it takes so long to cast in battle that your target is likely dead before it even goes off.  Again, I might be completely wrong and mages might be absolutely game breaking, but this game does such a poor job of introducing their playstyle, that I feel completely gimped using one.  It's kind of a shame because I typically love using mages in CRPGs.\n\nOften as I was playing I wasn't sure if what I was encountering in the game was a bug, a design decision, or just something that wasn't properly explained.  For example, in my first playthrough before my party died, there were no NPCs on the screen.  Once I reloaded my game, all of a sudden the area I was in was filled with NPCs, one of them I could recruit into my party and he actually had real equipment, not just kitchen knives like the rest of my people had.  It felt odd to me that the party members I created felt so worthless the instant I recruited someone who came equipped with a real weapon.\n\nAnother random gripe I have is that the mouse scrolling in the game does not work very well with multiple monitors.  I have to use the arrow keys to pan the camera around since my cursor would go off screen anytime I tried to look around the area.  Also often times in battle when I would tell my characters to move somewhere they would get stuck on the most minor of obstacles even though there were plenty of free paths available to them.  I've played a lot of CRPGs, but none of them have been as frustrating to get the hang of as this one.\n\nEDIT: I'm seeing a lot of comments about my gripe that scrolling doesn't work very well with multiple monitors.  I guess I'll clarify what I meant because I wasn't asking for multi-monitor support, I was asking for full screen mode to lock the cursor inside the borders of your active screen.  In most CRPGs, when you set the game to full screen mode, you can move your cursor to the edge of the screen and this will pan the camera in the direction of the edge you're touching.  In this game, full screen mode doesn't lock your cursor within the confines of the game, so when you have multiple monitors and try to scroll using your mouse, your cursor leaves the screen entirely and stops being registered.  From a development perspective, I don't imagine this would be a difficult fix to implement, but as it stands, you pretty much have to use the arrow keys to pan the camera around which puts your left hand at an awkward position for pausing, quick saving, and opening your spell book.","May 28, 2015","false","2.1"," 141 of 238 people (59%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","59","141","238","10","19"

Then congratulations you've found the game for you! While I don't have many hours in it, and admittedly I'm not very far, the quality is still very apparent. This game sidesteps Baldur's Gate's issue of casts per day, as per the DnD core rules by simply making the spells all channeled and certain equipment can increase or decrease the cast time for each of these spells. This game also has it's own combat skills for the sword and board types to engage the more melee centric players/characters. This healthy amount of skills compensates it's smaller and more basic weapon selection. It's biggest fault however is it's difficulty. Not that it is too hard, but instead that frequent deaths cause lots of staring at loading screens, and these loading screens can take a minute or two. This doesn't sound like much, but when you take into account that a single bandit can kill 2 early game party members on their own, it can be quite frustrating. My two cents though? Stick with it!

As an obvious throwback to the pixelated 2D days of no quest markers, note-taking and no handholding - your brain is your navigational compass and your memory (or willingness to pay attention during reading and/or write things down) will be your eyes and ears through the bleak, dismal open world surrounding you.\n\nIf you bought the game to make all your own decisions, hoping to get a nostalgic beat down spliced with D&D'esque rules along the way - you picked the right game. If you bought the game hoping to be told precisely where A and B is, passing the time with romances while you follow markers that signpost everything for you to follow while you sleep - oh dear, you're in the wrong place.\n\nPros:\nOpen world.\nClassic art-style.\nDecisions to make.\nNo handholding (can be viewed as a con by others).\nClassless (no templates, no presets. You make your own character from the ground up).\n\nCons:\nClunky UI.\nAimless roaming (in a sense that the world is generous when it comes to huge - but empty and rewardless - areas).\nChoppy animations (while they can be forgiven considering the adopted art style, that doesn't mean you have to like or accept 3-4 frame attacks, or the same recycled spell animation).\nNot very exciting - now, don't mistake that for 'not fun'. It is fun - though if you find yourself short on goals to reach, prepare for a lot of slow walking while looking for things to do.\n\nUltimately, this game has a lot going for it - moreso than the negative - and is worth the time of anyone looking to step back in time and sample a game that doesn't treat you like you can't figure it out for yourself.","July 3, 2015","true","26.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

They have unlimited uses.\nVery difficult, with no hand holding.\nEvery skill/stat point feels precious.\nNo character classes(freely shape your character) and no equipment restrictions.\nEvery npc seems killable\n\nThings I didn't like:\n20$, as this game doesn't feel finished.  $10 would be more acceptable in current release state.\nSpell casting times are dreadfully long.  Other than heals, the other spells are pointless.\nLong load times.  I'm running Raid 0 ssd's and load screen can take 10 seconds for a small area.\nAggressive party AI just makes everyone auto-attack, no spell casting.\nPassive/No party AI sometimes goes into auto-attack mode.\nStarting with no equipment, and i do mean none! I know how to get around this, but still.\nForced to have at least one healer in party, as there is no rest/regen option outside of food/pots.\nReloading a map or saved game, sometimes results in npcs being in different locations.\nChild npc's that are full grown men(furthers the feeling this game isn't polished yet).\nLack of quests.\nEnemy encounters usually rely on overwhelming numbers or drastically higher leveled and geared.\n\n\nI do really like this game, it just needs more work.  I feel like it left kickstarter too soon, and is truly in an open beta version.  With the right polishing this could really be a memorable experience.  Below I will share some funny bugs I have come across.\n\nBugs:\nThree of my party members were fighting the possessed child in map 1.  Around 80% of the time he lands a 1d11.  When your characters only have around 20 hp, this is stupidly hard.  Using a kiting combination of healing and fever, I disarm him.  He's been melee attacking me with fists the entire time, but drops a crossbow?  That explains the stupidly high damage I suppose.  This took almost 15 saves to pull off, but then I encountered my first major bug.\n\nI have my party on NO AI, well 2 of party members are waiting outside of the hole, during the entire events i described previously.  All of a sudden a dialogue starts.  I'm thinking "Wow, i disarmed the possessed child, and now he wants to talk.... wait a mintue."  One of the 2 party members sitting outside, all on her own, decided to explore the other side of the map, that I hadn't even been to yet.  She pulled foxes along with her, and had encountered a story driven npc.  I click for her to come back to where I had her previously. The foxes kill the story driven npc, then enter the town and start attacking settlers!  I finish up with the possessed child and start getting everyone together, only to find the settlers are now attacking me!!!!!  They wipe me out and I have to do all of this over. Mind you, i never attacked anyone in the city and I didn't ask this character to auto-explore the map -_-.\n\nSecond major bug I came across, some npcs will not attack you until they take at least 1 point of damage.  So you can disarm them with spells, then decide after taking their weapon if you want to fight them or not.","December 13, 2015","false","7.3"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","17","27","0","2"

I havent seen this type of art style(similar) in a very long time. It is a definate throw-back to the old golden age of RPG video gaming. Some might be turned off, but even for what it is...the graphics grow on you after a time. Its a deliberate art style and I find that it works.\n\nIve been playing for a while and I think the game is a very good one. It is retro and oldschool; meaning that it doesnt hold your hand and for the world it presents is very non-linear and open. You can go where you want at any given time. It is open skill based and stat based. You can build your party and your avatar in any shape that you wish. It works.\n\nThe game does not lead you from one quest/location to another. This is not Skyrim in the least. The only "journal" that you have is "recent conversations". Everything else is something that you must either add by hand outside of the video game(pen and paper) or you can use the in-game note system that allows you to record notes in a make-shift journal. I actually like it. It makes you pay attention.\n\nThe spell system is actually very good in my opinion in that you do not have "mana" to contend with. All spells can be cast as much as you want and when you want. Healing spells are sustainable which means that they will continuously heal ever "tick" of the in-game combat system.\n\nCombat itself is technically real-time, but you can pause the action with the space bar to micro-manage things in a similar vein to the Baldur's Gate series. I quick save alot and apparently on a reload the enemies in the immediate area reshuffle/respawn. Good or bad depending on how you look at that, but it enables you to get experience to level your characters.  Combat is dangerous and does take some tactical consideration.\n\nThe atmosphere and presentation is very good for what they intended. The story is unique and many passive skills enable you to garner additional lore to learn about the game world. They even come in handy in other unique ways such as the "woodwise" skill allowing you to speak to animals. The "Linquistics" skill is essentially a type of sorcery that uses incantations which are basically "Words of Power". Very unique.\n\nThey put a lot of effort into descriptions for items in the game and it is worthwhile to get used to reading so as to not get lost in whats going on.\n\nThe music and sound are good enough to be pleasant on the ears.\n\nOverall the game appeals to a nostalgic oldschool feel. It feels a mix between games such as Planescape: Torment, Baldur's Gate, Arcanum and the old DOS RPG games and the other oddball RPG that had good and unique qualities but have been lost to the mists of history.\n\nThe game is well worth the price and I do believe its a unique gem. The developers were able to put alot of creativity into it.\n\nWe need more games like this.","July 16, 2015","true","10.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

This is not a glib metaphor, this is an account of the inability of my warriors to kill a lone goblin without suffering critical damage, the inaccessibility of healing unless I rolled it on my main character because I arbitrarily can't rest in a field miles from anywhere because of invisible anti-loitering patrols, and the game's general unwillingness to warn me that I needed healing.\n\nWith a healing spell, combat so far becomes trivial, since it's the only spell that so far works in combat and it works really well.\n\nI also think that "not including a map" and "making the player manually hunt the screen for interactive objects" were both terrible features of old fashioned RPGs that really don't add anything to the genre, but I expected those going in.","June 26, 2015","false","4.2"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","22","39","0","0"

The setting is inspired, and the sound design combines with the aesthetics in really pleasing ways to create this moody, dark experience that's nothing like anything that I've experienced in the best way. The world and the lore are really easy for me to get lost in, and keeping your own journal isn't as hard as it sounds and is one of the most immersive mechanics I've ever seen in a video game. The magic system is very reminiscent of the Eastern European fairytales that it so heavily draws from, and things like the Aptitudes' secondary effects (Woodwise allowing you to talk to animals, which leads to quest threads and other goodies). I love the feel of this game, and I even have come to love how quicksave-quickloady the combat tends to get, although that's not for everyone. It's kinda cool that you're always just a roll of the dice away from a bad situation, it's keeping me on my toes. I've definitely had to approach this  more slowly and with a hell of a lot more patience than I usually have for games, but it's paid dividends in immersion and potentially replayability. I've had a hell of an experience so far, and it's so damn different than everything else that I've been playing that I'd say, yeah, play it. Play the hell out of it, soak it up. Whether or not you like it and take to it is secondary to the experience of playing this game the way the creators of it clearly intended; with an open mind, and a hunger for a kind of adventure that not much else will get you.

I played through it even though I wasn't sure if I really would at the beginning.\n\n+ I'm not big fan of all these Pixel Artists nowadays but if the game's god I don't mind. Serpent in the Staglands does it pretty good, the Art style doesn't annoy and it's animations are good.\n\n+ Music was a little repetitive but the pieces themselves were excellent.\n\n+ Story was good. Especially the main plot. You can explore the whole world right at the beginning and by far the best part is that lots of things you do on your journey participate on the main plot. So you don't feel like abandoning your original mission with stupid side quests, it just fits!\n\n- Combat. I LOVE old school games. However I don't see the need for dice-calculated damage anymore. D&D had its own rules but a pure videogame ruleset should really manage differenty. Also a lot of the spells felt too similar and some of the others are just outright criminally op. The grade 3 Teleport-spell was the easy way to destroy everything at the end of the game. set it up, watch enemies loop themselves and meanwhile have your archer and your mage with Arcane Attack shoot down everything. Could have been countered by setting up less melee-only enemies.\n\n- Puzzles. I just personally hate puzzles. Riddles? Totally! But definitly not puzzles where you have to travel half across the map to colect details you might have missed without even knowing IF there are any details you could have missed...

Serpent in the staglands is relative to most top down Rpg's in that era when the Genre was very popular. but this is unlike those Rpgs this particular Rpg is what they are sappose to be ....Difficult and immersive without a well thought out plan and a reaction for every action in this game you will find you and your party dead in every way possible in the game dont take this title lightly...you are in for a true Rpg experience the trading sytem is a good addition as well. you dont just have the title of spice trader you live it along with managing your party and everything else that comes with that you also need to watch your trade routes and stay updated on whats going on with your routes so nothing happens to your income. but theres more to this game than just two features you must pick it up and try it yourself. the in game journal is very impressive and editable in my opinion and the notes YOU create can be changed at anytime and trust me DO NOT take a step in this game unless you at least understand how that journal works because it helps with the immersion and Quest tracking because this game has no automatic quest tracking...its all on you so if you enjoy a Truly immersive Rpg and story this is the game for you otherwise stay away from it until you feel youve got at least the basic mechanics and features of the game figured out. as a side note someone good at titles as rare as this needs to do a very in depth letsplay I would watch it, this game will have you getting pretty serious at times which just makes it all the better.","July 29, 2015","true","6.3"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

The devs are working very hard to fix the bugs and finish the balancing. There are *daily patches*, which I highly appreciate. But still this game should be labeled as early access - especially because fundamental things like the overall balancing are still being changed continuously. Therefore it makes little sense to start a proper playthrough at the moment, as a character build might behave totally different after the next patch.

The promise of a flexible narrative and properly immersive RPG gameplay is something that will draw in quite a few players. However, I think the developers are going to find that large numbers of players never reach this element, if it does exist, due to introductions like the one I experienced. I reproduce my experience so that the designers can be aware of these stumbling blocks and perhaps address them.\n\nThe very beginning started out promisingly enough, with some unannounced figure querying me about my past as a god. I like this, I feel like I'm setting out some basic facts, imposing my personality on the game world. The slightly choppy graphics are no issue here, as I feel like it's being carried off with a retro style. I'm enthusiastic about crafting a character and seeing an introduction.\n\nWe hit the game world, and my brow furrows a bit. The text here is reading as fairly stilted, rather unpolished for so early and critical a scene. I am jarred by a typo, a grammatical error or two.\n\nWe're also being annoyingly scripted. I have almost no conversational options, my responses to information being deposited on me by this priest fellow are all pre-ordained. Where was that sense of imposing my personality from before? Perhaps I am a dread and vengeful god, who will truck none of this familiarity, leaving the priest to stutter out his apologies and plead with me to see reason? Perhaps I am a stoic creature, who tolerates a babbling priest with little more than a raised eyebrow and a knowing smile?\n\nWith a thin veil cast over it by the conversation, I come to the character creation screen. It's mildly confusing, but clicking around gets me a sense of it. Noting with some annoyance that the font size to container size ratio was bloating text into a long, thin arrangement I had to scroll up and down, I start studiously reading the lore on the various races and sub-races or classes (I was not sure which, and indeed was not sure that these boxes represented choices rather than a list of attributes until after the first character was completed).\n\nAgain, I find myself annoyed by some weak writing -- technically speaking, that is, I wouldn't complain about info-dumps in racial background text. My expectations are sinking. While I was hoping for effectively minimal, I would have settled for poor graphics, but what I expected in return was a rich and well-polished lore, well presented in an interface which is freed from the need to trace rays of starlight as they glimmer on the dewdrops of the gardens. What I seem to be getting is neither style nor substance.\n\nForging on, I design my avatar. I think about it carefully, testing the various races. I settle on a follower of the god I listed as my ally in the introduction, reasoning that it would be a sane choice for a temporarily mortal deity. I squint at the head of my avatar as I alter the options, trying to discern the features I am choosing.  I decide I'm done.\n\nThe priest asks me if I want to create a companion. I'll be able to hire mercenaries if I don't.\n\nPerhaps this is due to a different gaming background, but I took that as a fantastic slap in the face. What, I'm being asked to create my entire adventuring party here, in this room, before I have seen anything of this world? Before I have any sense of what skills are valuable? Are mercenaries going to be my only other companions? Will I not pick up chance aquaintances, actual characters scattered around this world? Is the team never going to grow or shrink, barring my own calculations about mercenary hire? As it turns out, there are additional companions, though at least initially it would seem that gathering them is as simple as telling them to come with you.\n\nThere's not even any dressing on it. I am not being given the choice of concentrating my trapped essence into one form or multiple, balancing bonus skill points against the size of my party -- I can create one person, or what seems to be up to eight of identical strength (I did not in fact test the upper bound, I got bored of playing with the options at the fourth character).  This cheapens things quite considerably.\n\nThe priest now informs me of some people I could take with me. I feel uncomfortably aware that he is talking to a player rather than his deity. Perhaps it is my memory at fault, but I cannot, after this time in the character creation screen, recall what it was that he was advising me to do about my trapped-as-a-mortal issue. I could presumably find it in the backscroll, but I decide instead to explore my environment and the game's controls.\n\nWandering south, I summarily recruit someone to my party, finding no joy in it, as he is virtually indistinguishable from the characters I have so cheaply created. I find the journal system, and note with some pleasure that it operates as a create-your-own-notes system. I spend a few minutes creating an in-universe note about the trapped-as-a-mortal problem. Despite the ongoing problems with the relative sizes of the text and the textboxes, this simple setup is one of the most pleasing features so far, and reminds me why I wanted to play the game.\n\nSpirits buoyed, I walk around the main hall clicking on things. I note with some irritation that it's occasionally taking a few tries for the click event to register properly. I find a book which I can bleed on, and presume that that will somehow be important later. I could swear that the book is titled 'I hate this ♥♥♥♥ing thing' or something like that.  The priest offers no explanation, nor recognition that I have found a strange item in his domain, he just tells me to go to the garden.\n\nI wander into the library and peruse the shelves. I pick up a couple of items, speak briefly to some hovering NPCs who don't seem to have much to say. Here is where it goes wrong. I walk into the kitchen and decide to raid the cupboard. Clicking on it, the game produces a message in its sidebar about how this belongs to someone else. My attention momentarily distracted from the screen, I missed this message, and clicked again, thinking it was another instance of non-firing click events. I open the cupboards and am immediately branded an enemy of my own temple. Acolytes rush in to pummel my party with their fists. I stare in confusion as I try to figure out what's going on, eventually spotting the trace of my actions.\n\nI have not done anything to merit saving the game. I am uncomfortable with my avatars, too numerous for me to be attached to them. I am feeling jarred by writing errors and stilted, uninteresting conversations in a game which I expected to excel at polished writing and flexibility.\n\nI know that this is the introduction scene, the part of the game I can expect to be the most polished, the most examined by developers and testers. From here on in, the likelihood of bugs, errors and annoyances is only going to rise.\n\nI quit the game.\n\nI don't know whether Sepent in the Staglands goes on to deliver what it claims in terms of an open, evolving world of choice and consequence, because I have been put off attempting it again by the entirely unimmersive introduction. It feels like something I will have to steel myself to attempt again at some point, a direct contrast to the joy I usually feel at toying with the opening sections of most of its competitors for my attention.","January 1","false","0.8"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","4","15","0","1"
