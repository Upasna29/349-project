"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/219830/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","The moment I fell in love with King Arthur’s Gold is a moment that I have never been able to repeat, and likely never will. My team, red, was at the gates of the blue team’s home base for nearly 20 minutes, stuck in a stalemate that never seemed to go anywhere. The blue team had constructed a massive tower, complete with spikes and platforms for archers that made it impossible to ascend. To make matters worse, it was on the edge of a lake, meaning there was no easy way for us to dig under their tower and attack from behind. I was at a loss as to how we would be able to win, until someone had the bright idea to construct a boat.\n\nIt wasn’t just any boat mind you, for it was a war boat designed for ramming enemy fortifications that could also double as a spawn point. I, along with 12 others, hopped on the boat, and sailed towards the enemy stronghold. Arrows bounced off the hull, and someone was in the proper mind to shout “RAMMING SPEED!” through chat as we slammed into the base of the tower. It collapsed with one blow, and it killed around 20 people, defenders and boat people alike, in the ensuing chaos. But it didn’t matter, for within the next minute my team stormed into the enemy’s last stronghold and secured victory.\n\nI encountered several similar moments throughout King Arthur’s Gold, each different from the last. Yet they all had one quality in common: insanely ridiculous action. And that is what this great multiplayer experience is really about.\n\nKing Arthur’s Gold is a two-dimensional side scrolling multiplayer game that pits two teams of 16 players against each other across several game modes. While each game mode differs in terms of goals, they all focus around building fortifications in your teams base and assaulting your opponents in return. The three classes that one can choose from and switch between at any point in the game are the knight, who focuses on stabbing and slicing the life and limbs out of his opponents; the archer, who has a wide variety of arrows for any situation alongside a handy-dandy grappling hook for climbing; and the builder, who can harvest resources and build epic structures that will make medieval castle designers blush upon first glance.\n\nEach class works well in most situations. Knights are for when you feel like suicide bombing an enemy’s front gate, or want to not die as often as everyone else. Archers are for when you get tired of dying as a knight and want to rain death on whatever patch of ground takes your fancy. And builders, my personal favorite, are when you want to bugger off and construct elaborate traps and structures that someone will hopefully appreciate one day. It’s a healthy trio that allows for one to never get too bored, as you could just as easily change your style at a moment's notice.\n\nAs a general rule in multiplayer games, I tend to like it when there is a certain order to how the game operates. Objective is to kill the enemy team? I’ll grab a rifle, walk forward and start shooting. King Arthur’s Gold is an exception to that, in more ways than one. While a match will always start with some semblance of planning in effect, within five minutes utter chaos will descend upon the map. Suddenly the enemy is digging a tunnel under your capture point, and you forgot to place spikes around the pit of death you just constructed. Your teammates are imitating kamikaze pilots as they march to set off bombs at the enemy gates, and the catapult someone just constructed has just fallen over and killed a builder. And to top it off, you just discovered that not only do sharks exist in the water and that they can eat you, but they can also be ridden like a horse at the rodeo.\n\nThe amount of crazy that occurs in any given match never ceases to produce laughter and keep me entertained. Seriously, I discovered shark riding on accident. The simplicity of the game, combined with the number of possibilities that can be exploited, make for one hell of an entertaining ride.\n\nThat’s not to say that there are not any problems with King Arthur’s Gold. There is a singleplayer mode included within the game, along with a genuinely helpful tutorial that brings you up to basics quickly. The singleplayer is bland as a whole, lacking any of the chaos that is present throughout the game’s multiplayer portion. The AI is a pain, mostly because the archers have a godlike aim to them and the constant pursuit by them does not help ease the pain in singleplayer. In fact, one could skip out on the singleplayer portion entirely and not miss out on a single important concept that is necessary to know for the multiplayer.\n\nAnd this may be minor nitpicking, but there are several bugs that are found in multiplayer that I have come across several times. For one, I occasionally was unable to respawn after dying, forcing myself to disconnect and rejoin a server to gain the function back again. And after several matches, I and several others I was playing with had to leave a server because the game was convinced that the new match would not start for half an hour. These were not isolated instances, and whether these glitches will be present for long remains to be seen.\n\nBut I digress, for those bugs do not take away from my overall impression of King Arthur’s Gold, which is a great multiplayer game that stands out from the crowd by being something that embraces lunacy and remains grounded with simple mechanics that allow for a variety of strategies.\n\nHighly Recommended!\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 21, 2014","true","50.5"," 477 of 509 people (94%) found this review helpful 86 people found this review funny","94","477","509","86","10"

There is a pretty steep learning curve, and the lack of a decent tutorial makes this worse. Balance and maps have improved, but I still find long, 3-4 hour stalemates fairly common in large matches.\n\nThe positive:\n\nKing Arthur's Gold is a truly unique experience. There's something for everyone in this game, whether you enjoy building massive fortresses, killing hordes of enemies, or role playing on a giant map with different races and factions. There is a decent competitive scene if you're into that sort of thing. Matches are usually full of people with mixed experience, so newer and more casual players can enjoy themselves as well. KAG is one of the most unique, addictive, and challenging games  that I have ever played, and is definitely worth checking out.\n\nAll things considered, King Arthur's Gold is probably the best ten dollars I've ever spent on Steam.","December 22, 2014","true","418.2"," 168 of 174 people (97%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","97","168","174","11","4"

That doesn't mean it get's boring, it gets even better with more playthroughs. (Shields are extremely useful with bombs, duh.)\n\nWorkers are able to earn money, and can use some of the stuff to build a proficient base. Trap doors are useful, just put some spikes under, and watch your enemies fall into the pit.\n\nSTORY: Since this game IS mainly focused on MULTIPLAYER, it doesn't have much of a story; save the princess. It serves more as a tutorial for a newbie (real useful). The story-mode features multiple levels, and if you don't like the princess, you can just simply  murder her in cold blood, and forget about the main objective.\n\nGRAPHICS: By the screenshots, you weren't expecting something graphically intensive like Battlefield Hardline. Good, we don't need 'expensive graphics', this game's simple textures are simply pleasing to the eye. And if you don't like the current theme, or you simply don't like the color of the workers, you can change it.\n\nYou can either search up texture packs, or you can do the following:\n- Right click the game\n- 'Properties' - 'Local Files' - 'Browse Local Files' - 'Base'\n- Find an image editor (Gimp, Photoshop, Pixlr, anything that suits your liking)\n- Copy the destination\n- Just open the images in the editor :)\n\nMUSIC & SOUNDS: The music is nice, as are the sounds to it. They're basic, but you shouldn't be focusing your main attention on the music anyhow (unless you want some epic battle, boss-scene music).\n\n[9/10]\nEverything is nice, everything adds up, the game is good at being itself; a war game. It does everything right, and everything is customizable.","November 9, 2015","true","22.9"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","34","38","3","18"

Like every other multiplayer based game in this era, it is expected that the community is terrible (which is very, very sad), and KAG is no exception- With incompetent allies, moronic chat-spammers, and annoying griefers, this game has its fair share of community troubles.\nBut that is not something the developers can control.\nSome other main complaints about this game are things that the developers CAN control, such as useless kegs (update months ago caused them to be virtually unusable outside of getting shot out of a catapult, but even that can go haywire after a simple arrow can shoot the keg off your back), and weakend ballista bolts- Seriously, 2 shots for 1 bolt? Now that I think of it, though, these really are my only complaints- everything else is generally balanced.\n\nAs for the good things, A lot of them I didnt list- For example, you can do things such as launching your best friend straight into enemy territory via catapult, crashing down enemy towers (Just for the awesome physics of this game you should buy it),  and taming sharks- thats right. TAMING. SHARKS.\n\n1 last thing before I sign this review off- There is seriously a lack of players in this game right now- What happened to the 5-or-6 full servers ay any given time? now hardly anyone plays Take the Halls, and when someone does it rarely exceeds 10 people.\n\nRating-\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 9.5/10\nCommunity: 8/10\nFun-Value/Value for Your Money: 10/10\nUniqueness: 10/10\n\nTotal- 46.5/50\n\nVerdict-\nThis game is seriously worth the money- You will get every penny you put into this game out in entertainment. There is no reason not to get this game, for it is just a small $10, which is just 2-3 skipped Starbucks coffee. You will seriously enjoy it.\n(Do not let my steam hours fool you, I have well over 200 hrs put into this game, plus whatever steam says I played)\n","October 31, 2014","true","54.5"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","29","31","7","0"

Where do we begin?\n\nLet's say you just start in the game. You have no tutorials, you are just thrown into a random game. What do you do? You begin building a fort. You see someone else doing an entirely different thing. Are you doing it wrong? One guy is putting trap blocks over a hole, another is digging a large tunnel with water, another is creating rooms packed with traps and class shops. Who is right and who is wrong?\n\nAll of you are right! This game encourages creativity. Using what's around you and turning it against your enemies. A shark in a pit killing soldiers? Turn it into a trap. Enemies built a wall? Launch yourself in a catapult. It is all these different ways to play that make every game so fun.\n\nAssume they are putting heavy siege upon your walls. Off the top of my head, you can:\n- Build tunnels for a constant stream of defense.\n- Fill a boat with explosives and ram it into them.\n- Get a boat full of builders to destroy the small base they built.\n- Build walls behind the wall that is under siege\n- Dozens of more ways, for you to discover!\nTo counter these:\n- Have builders climb up using ladders to destroy the tunnel.\n- Sacrifice yourself by turning the boat back into their wall, toppling it over into their base.\n- Knights to stab the builders.\n- Put your catapult on a boat for a constant push on each wall.\n\nTL:DR, King Arthurs gold is a fun game that encourages creativity to defeat your enemies.\n9/10","June 19, 2014","true","9.0"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","31","37","0","0"

The latter keeps things simple, with enough expression in each of the three classes to make them distinguishable, yet not overly complex, whereas the former is a stroke of genius.\n\nAt the beginning of each game, you and your team will have a short space of time to construct whatever you deem effective in staving off the enemy. Teamwork is essential, as a good castle is perhaps more important than good combat skill. Once the match starts, sheer hell is unleashed.\n\nThe ground between two bases becomes a warzone. Makeshift wooden structures are built only to be destroyed a second later. Knights use their shields as makeshift gliders to parachute into the midst of the war, archers hang from trees and walls, sniping anything wearing a shirt that isn't their colour, and builders hang back in the base, pixelated faces cackling as they toss a boulder into the enemy or pefect a foolproof deathtrap.\n\nThe games are fast and furious, but what elevates it even further from other MOBAs is the drop-in / drop-out feature. Is the other builder overruling your suggestions for a space tower and is nicking all your gold? No big D. Just leave that game and enter another. Are you having trouble fighting, or even surviving more than thirty seconds post-spawn? Fine! I'm sure your skills would be valued in a new game. The seemingly obvious issue of everyone leaving as soon as the tide turns is obliterated by the gameplay, however; fortune never rests with one team for long. As such, this game is often my go-to for fast fun before I need to go somewhere and don't have time to be locked into a thirty-minute game, the threat of my status being diminished should I leave constantly hovering behind the 'quit' button.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is fun, moddable and a great long or short term solution to the MOBA hankering. In my opinion, it's worth every penny.","August 31, 2015","true","33.2"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","24","29","2","7"

Where if you don't keep your wits about you, you may fall in battle at anytime and there're always enemies along the way willing to fight you with such reckless hate that you may wonder why you bought Kag to start with. But take heart there're also those who would defend you, those who would fight for your honour, those that you will forge a friendship with that is so powerful it could only ever be made in the heat of battle.\n\nIn short King Arthur's Gold is an adventure waiting to happen, with many friendships to be made along the way. All you have to do is climb board.","December 15, 2015","true","503.8"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","1"

Every single time I've given it a thumbs up. The reason I keep coming back to it is because I almost every time I play (coming from a guy who's 700+ hours on this) I find something new I love about it. The gameplay is one of a kind, the skill ceiling is as high as you can imagine, I've been playing for almost 2 years and I'm still getting better, still learning new things. I know some people say this game has a bad community, honestly, I disagree. So many of the people I've talked to and played with in KAG are fun, positive people, while there are, obviously, some instances of less-than-stellar community, they are, in my experience, few and far between. One thing to keep in mind is there is an undeniably steep learning curve. If you're the type of person who can't play a game where you have to get rekt a few times to be any good, this isn't the game for you. However, it's not a punishing game, I had fun playing when I was god-awful, and I have (a bit more) fun now that I'm, at least in my opinion, not bad. I've never gotten tired of KAG. I've played this game for countless hours, yet I can really only claim to be good at one of the three classes, knight; I'm trying to get better at archer and I'm an abysmal builder. While the playerbase is smaller than it used to be, it's far from dead, I still see new players all the time (especially with the sale on) and I often play with people I've enjoyed getting rekt by for 2 years. In conclusion, BUY THIS GAME. Especially with the sale on, this is MORE than worth the money; I can honestly say I would have trouble thinking of a better 10$ I've spent. Buy it, play it, have an amazing time.","August 11, 2014","true","971.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

It's a team vs team warfare game (played in matches) with some resource-gathering / base-building game mechanics.\n\nI thought this was a good game, though ultimately it wasn't for me.  The gameplay is very engaging and exciting, and the three classes (builder, knight, archer) are distinct enough from each other to invoke good teamwork between players.  I give the game a solid 8 out of 10 for quality.\n\nThat being said, the reason I recommend against this game is for two reasons: 1. The community is fairly hostile. This differs for everyone, but some of the core members of the community (those that claim to be anyway) tend to be a little rude towards new people.  2. The developers / administrators of this game condone and moderate global banning - which means that if you were somehow eligible (to them) for a global ban, you would no longer be able to join any participating servers (by default, every server participates).","November 29, 2013","false","11.2"," 121 of 217 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","121","217","0","22"

I  don't think the trailer does it justice, games are pretty fast paced and chaotic. You have to actually play this game to see how awesome it is. Don't let the "offline singleplayer" bullet fool you, the single player mode consists of a few (not very good) tutorials and a mini platformer-esque campaign. The meat and potatoes of this game is the online multiplayer. It's trial by fire on some of the servers but it doesn't take too long to figure it out. I'd recomend reading some of the guides here on Steam before you play as opposed to relying on the in-game tutorials.

Side-scrolling PVP at it's best. Create your own fortress then race to tear down the opponents. The game features the ability to construct your own fortress both in a build mode and on the fly. Gather materials from around the map to make your fortress as strong as possible. You can also use those same materials to create devices of destruction to bring down your opponents creations.\n\nMultiple classes to choose from that are all very well balanced. A knight for the up close work, hack your enemies to bits! An archer for the ranged, stick one in their eye! Or an builder for support, build a cage around them! The classes are all very easy to learn and you'll be chopping heads from the start, however the gameplay is not shallow and there is a huge difference between someone who is skilled and those who aren't. As a new player I was amazed when I encountered someone who actually knew how to play the knight well and it gave me a chance to really learn how deep the gameplay was.\n\nThis game is a must play for everyone who is is into building sidescrollers(Terraria, Starbound, etc) and loves PVP.

This side-scroller is incredibly addictive and draws you in incredibly quickly, as there are always new tactics to master as the three classes: Builder, Archer and the Knight. Whether this is bomb jumping, keg-hurling, or trap building, these tactics all have devastating, and hilarious, results.\nThus, I cannot recommend this game enough to anyone with some spare time to kill!","January 11, 2014","true","660.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It takes some time to get used to, but it's a very fun experience when people work together. The only problem with the game is its community, which is extremely toxic to people who are new to the game and makes finding a place on one of the barely populated servers very difficult. The game is plenty fun, and if you do get a good team, you will do well. Though, just like any other team-based game, get a bad team, you will have a bad time. Vote-kicking is a thing, so the players can manage themselves without a mod, though there is support to mods to administrate servers. Though, sometimes these votes can be knee-jerked and people will run you right off the server(though vote-kicks only last 5 minutes).\n\nDespite the griefers, scrubs, elitists, and outright man-babies, it's an extremely fun game for anyone who can stomach the people who play it.","May 18","true","106.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

The community doesn't care that you are learning the game. Contrary to other games, where other players are helpful and friendly, the community of this game will jump at the chance to ban you from the server for no apparant reason.\n\nTips to avoid being banned:\n-play games in your region (to avoid being kicked for high ping)\n-do not play builder as a new player (chances are you will be accused of "digging shops" or "griefing")\n-do not mess with fire, bombs, or any other variation of","June 4","false","4.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game has mechanics that truly keep your mind racing in so many ways, no match, will never play out the same as another.\n\nLiving out heroic actions like bomb jumping twice over an enemies citidel, into the heart of their fortress decimating workers and archers alike and shattering an enemies supply of explosives and ammo, at the same time occupying the enemy long enough for your fellow teamates to topple the enemies walls and swarm in for the massacre.\n\n-Absolutly Glorious-\n\nMoments like these play out ever more frequently the more comfortable and knowledgeable you get with the game rewarding skill with beautiful results.

This system works on some occasions but widely doesn't. These situations are: Players not voting in votes causing unfair votes, Players skipping the map during the game because their team is losing or are about to lose, Players hurling abuse at a player because of something they built or because they feel like it causing the affected player to give a reaction back only for the player hurling abuse to use the vote system against them gaining votes from friends so the affected player gets kicked, Players who did not witness a suspected "griefing, hacking ect..."player then voting themselves for them to get kicked, Players who falsely accuse another player of doing something and rally up support from people who didn't witness the event in chat thus getting the affected player kicked, Players who misinterperet someone who is trying to help the team thinking they are griefing thus getting them kicked. I have been falsely accused of doing many things from griefing to hacking in many of the ways spoken about above and many more that I would take years to write. Quite a lot of the above also ties into the bad side of the KAG community\n\n-Community\n-The "Bad-side" of the community\nIf I somehow find I have 5hrs of free time to write the "bad-side" of the KAG community then I would happily rant on and on and on. However my language wouldn't be suitable for steams "Rules and Guidelines" They would make a new filter for customer reviews called: "Help us".\n\n=======================I will finish this review at some point==================","June 29, 2015","true","235.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Throughout development the devs have been with the community the whole time. They listen to most good ideas and fix annoying bugs within the game.\n\nThis was probably the best community i've ever been apart of, starting off as a nomral scrub, and now a tester and a moderator. People are friendly and spread their ideas greatly.\n\nNow, lets get into the game.\n\nThe vanilla game is set out of two teams fighting eachother. Blue team on the left, and red on the right.\n\nThere are currently three (3) gamemodes. Take The Halls (TTH), Capture The Flag (CTF) and Team Death Match (TDM)\n\nTTH is gamemode where you fight to take eachothers halls. YOu must kill all enemys within the hall to cap it. It takes around 6 seconds to cap. But if enemys are near it takes longer. The team to take all halls wins.\n\nCTF is your basic all-rounder game. Caprute enemy flags and bring it back to yours.\n\nTDM is first team to reach a certain amount of kills. There is no build time in this gamemode.\n\nThere is build times in TTH and CTF. Build time is basically time giving your team to build defences.\n\n\nThere are animals, siege weapons, explosives and more!\n\nThe game consists of three classes, the Knight, Builder and the Archer.\nThe knight is the main force of your team, allowing to buy explosives to destroy other teams things, and castles.\n\nThe builder is a support class and your main defence. Building massive castles and laddering into enemy lines, he has the main power of destroying blocks.\n\nThe archer is another support class, shooting arrows and supporting your teams knights.\n\nThis is seriously one of the best games i've ever had in my life. $10.00 was well spent. I may only have 600+ hours, but only on steam. I have spent over 3000+ hours throughout these years.","November 9, 2013","true","078.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

It's a pity the only included single player campaign is designed only around the Knight.\nMultiplayer will actually play out much like modern FPS games. Yes, there are rocket jumping knights in this game. Here are the unique abilities of each class:\n\nArcher: Grappling Hook, Charge Attack (fires 3 arrows if you keep clicking), Fire 4 arrow types (normal, water, fire, bomb).\nBuilder: Mine, Build, Deconstruct. Builders make all things including workshops to manufacture items for the other classes.\nKnight: Block, Charge Attack (breaks through block, usually killing the other knight if you know how to cheat, and I don't),\nUse Bombs (water and explosive), use heavy demolition, fly with shield (further with chicken), bomb jump, weaker deconstruct (knights can chop through wood and dirt, but must bomb through stone). They can also surf over rough terrain using their shield.\n\nAs you can imagine most multiplayer sessions devolve into rushing for bombs and demolitions and then most players switch to knights because they are so overpowered. The game could be much better than what it is with a few simple changes to the knight (remove charge attack, have shield only block arrows and melee, make stone blocks tougher, remove supply drops). But as it stands the combat oriented players will win every time over builders and their traps.\n\nIt would also be nice if you could make a custom castle or fortress and then use that at the beginning of every game rather than having to rebuild it at the start of each new game. Sadly I cannot recommend the game in its current state, which feels very pre-alpha to me.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add that very occasionally you will hear a strange glitchy (loud) noise and every member of your team will die. There is some cheating in this game. Be warned.","January 9, 2014","false","342.3"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

Since classic mode I have been playing this game, and I have seen the changes that has taken over it... let me just say, these changes only make this game even more awesome. This game is the TF2 of side scrollers, it’s THAT AWESOME!\n\nKing Arthur's Gold is an action, building, 2D - Sidescroller, with 3 classes, knights, archers, builders, and catapults, fire, war boats, explosions, explosions, explosions... explosions... explosions.... and chickens and sharks (You can pick up the shark and use it as a weapon in game).While understanding the physics and controls may be a bit awkward at first, once you quickly get to understand it, the game will be either meh, or one of the most fun times you've had. Allow me to describe my very last game that I've played, because there is simply to much I can talk about.\n\n\nIt was a 1 flag vs 1 flag capture the flag match, 14 vs 14. The map was rather large and covered with stone, stone, stone, and more stone. This told us right off that we wouldn't need to worry much about using fire (which is very useful against enemies who build with mainly wooden structures (only usable by archers). The map was more or less W shaped, with a piece of land on each side of the map (for our respective bases) and 1 giant chunk in the middle. We put some basic care over our main base, but decided to put a rather large tower over the edge that connected with the lake, pond, that separated us from the middle island. This proved useful at the time and could not be taken. This gave us the advantage we needed and pressed forth. Sadly we didn't have enough men (many were still building back at home), and we were quickly pushed back. The enemy then took the middle island by blocking all the cave entrances with stone doors (which cannot be broken by knights, only by explosives or other builders). We have kept being assaulted by the enemy until we had built ourselves a catapult to squish them boulders. Then when we ran out of builders, we loaded OURSELVES into the catapult and invaded the central island. We did this, took the central island, was kicked out of the central island, and then invaded the central island again, destroying all the structures they had built on it... and then got kicked out again. To help press the attacks even further, we unleashed a rather deadly combo. We had built a tunnel that lead from our base to the front lines (a teleporting structure, basically), created a spawning structure on the front line, right next to the catapult, so that we would be able to constantly catapult ourselves over to the central island. This finally worked, and we took the central island, for good.\n\nFrom the central island onto the main enemy base was an absolute slaughter fest. We had tried to climb up onto their overlooking tower (which defended their flag), but was constantly struck down, it was like Bunker Hill. Then we tried to drill our way underneath the castle and catch them from behind, that failed and they filled up the hole. We kept trying to do either one of these tactics over and over again, but reached no anvil. I was beginning to grow impatient and then hatched an idea. I decided that we should built a tower from the very center of the central island, where the enemy could not reach yet. That tower would PIERCE THE HEAVENS, and we would place a catapult on the very top of it, and fly down from it onto them. I had created this tower out of stone (just in case they would attempt to burn it), placed the catapult on the top of the tower, loaded myself and an oversized explosive keg into it, and with the help of a team mate, launched myself directly on top of the enemy tower that defended the flag, blew open an oversized hole, seized the flag, and ran the hell off. THE GAME WAS WON! The whole game lasted roughly 2 hours.\n\nWhats great about this game, is the most amazing things, hilarious and glorious, can and probably will happen every single game you play. I can never get enough of all the crazy nonsense that happens, all the explosions, of all the flying behind enemy lines, and carnage, the destruction... this...\n\nKing Arthur's Gold is the game I've always dreamed about as a kid.","November 29, 2013","true","730.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It currently has three available classes, Knight, Archer, and Builder. The Knight has a sword and shield. You can hold down to have a strong sweep, or click for a simple stab. Holding down the left mouse button long enough will result in a glimmer which signals that you can make two strong sweeps. The Knight can also purchase bombs, which help destroy terrain, and water bombs, which stun enemies. The Archer has a bow and grappling hook. The grappling hook has a range of about 7 blocks, and pulls the player towards the block it has latched onto. The player can also move and climb while latched, and can also fire arrows. The archer has multiple types of arrows, including fire, which can set fire to wooden structures and players, and bomb arrows. The builder has the ability to build traps, obstacles, fortresses, and large-scale weapons such as a catapult.\n\nI personally enjoyed KAG, not to an addictive rate, but I still enjoyed playing the small campaign, creating in the sandbox, and playing multiplayer. There are modded servers for KAG, which I have not currently tried as of yet. I think it was a fairly good game, but would not reach my top 10. I recommend it for my friends with weaker computers, however, because it has fairly good graphics, small world generation, and high FPS. I do recommend this game, but not as much as some others.\n\n~Your friend in the background, Zak","December 21, 2013","true","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's even a setting in game for a kid-friendly gameplay experience. This game is a strategic build 'n' kill that's got a real emphasis for environments and role dependancy. Each team needs atleast 1 of each class to function properly. The environment is harsh with wild buffalo, sharks (SO MANY SHARKS), etc. that can all kill you much easier than you can kill them (which I find hilarious). The controls are simple, responsive and innovative. The graphics are very nostalgic in style but vibrant in colour and shape. This makes the scenery of the environment seem very glossy where it should be, and dingy where it should be. Dark areas are REALLY dark. This game even has a day/night system that does it's thing as you battle it out against your foes/friends.\n\nOverall I'd give the game the following ratings:\n4/5\n8.5/10\n87/100\n\nThis game is adorable.","November 1, 2014","true","8.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The enemy has to fight to the other’s base and steal their flag or kill the entire enemy to deplete the life counter of their team and finish the rest off. Deathmatch is the classic one life per player, duke it out to the death, PvP. And Zombie Survival mode has a small team of players surviving against zombie AI enemies which get steadily harder each night in the game that passes. The game is Free to Play, but most features are premium based, meaning that, for the most fun, buy it.\n\nThere are three different classes in this game, these are, knight, archer and builder. The knight; uses his shield to defend himself, and a sword to slash at others, this class also has thrown bombs. The archer is a ranged class; they can climb trees and fire from a fair distance. The last class, the builder, is where the sandbox elements come to play. To defend their base builders will build traps and defensive structures and also create siege weapons to use against the enemy structures, they also use their hammers and break enemy structures but are super weak offensively. I believe the addition of the builder was due to the popularity of games such as Minecraft and Terraria, and this has not hindered the game in any way, but has made it much more fun and open to other players who enjoy this type of genre. KAG has some decent balancing to the game design. It was mainly developed by a small company called Transhuman Design. The game has some “Mods” released but no full support as of yet. The game has been developed since 2011.\n\nThe main graphical design behind the game was based on the small title on the SNES,”King Arthur's World”. This is the reason the game is set in a pixelated 2D setting. I also believe this keeps the game simple in terms of Graphical User Interface. As such the game does age quite well, I’m sure I will be playing it for years still to come, so long as there are online players.\n\nI played this game during the late alpha phase, it was fun and decent, I often enjoyed hours on end slaying the enemy or even participating in “Clan Wars” on the PvP elements in the game. I was in the Best Australian clan, “[AOE]” until a few patches ruined balance and the clan broke apart. And from experience, I can say this game is worth it.","March 20, 2015","true","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

They are the last thing I would complain about in regards to this game.\nThe game is well balanced, isn't pay to win, and has a small and shallow learning curve, so you can just pick it up and play without much trouble.\nPerhaps the best part is all of the mods. If the original game ever gets a little stale for you, you can rest assured that there are plenty of mods to keep you entertained, from Shiprekt to Zombies.

The graphics aren't great, but they aren't exactly meant to be, sort of in the 8-bit style, like Minecraft. They are the last thing I would complain about in regards to this game.\nThe game is well balanced, isn't pay to win, and has a small and shallow learning curve, so you can just pick it up and play without much trouble.\nPerhaps the best part is all of the mods. If the original game ever gets a little stale for you, you can rest assured that there are plenty of mods to keep you entertained, from Shiprekt to Zombies. Let me tell you, if Shiprekt were its own independant game, I would still buy it.\n10/10","April 28, 2015","true","580.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The trailer looked so good I just had to get it, and I'm glad I did. I just feel I got it way too cheap, because this is a real gem.\n\nSince the game first appeared, lots of people have asked and discussed how KAG relates and compares to games like MineCraft and Terraria. I haven't actually played either of the two, but I've watched enough trailers and gameplay videos, I think, to say something about the differences. Firstly, KAG is more oriented around hectic team-versus-team combat in a couple of different flavors. Secondly, it features different classes with different abilities that really requires practice to master. The graphics are also 2D, with very crisp, blocky, cheerful sprites. Oh, and there are physics, effects and different player head costmetics. The crafting system is more shallow and simple; you harvest/mine resources or gather coins that you trade in for buildings, other materials, weapons or tools.\n\nThe game features several modes. Some of them I've mentioned. There's also a sort of obstacle course mode and a sandbox mode (single player). Sadly, that's all there is of official content (apart from a weird mod example). Previously, the game featured other modes such as a zombie survival mode. The good thing is, the game has a relatively good mod support, which people have taken advantage of to bring the zombie mode, amongst others, back to the game. There are also various other custom modes. Lately, I've mostly played theese mods.\n\nI love the action in this game, and I love building stuff. There's plenty of humor in the crazy battles and accidental deaths (sadly, there used to be more of those, but anyway). Graphics-wise it's top notch. Music is alright, but I wouldn't say no to more variety. There are some annoying quirks to building that I really had hoped they would sometime fix, but they have not. Some latency problems on certain servers (might especially apply to some modded servers). All in all though, it's just a lot of fun.\n\nIf the gameplay videos doesn't convince you, trying it should. Of course, it might not be everyone's cup of tea, fair enough. But I, at least, have had heaps of fun with this. It's quite addictive, and even after being away from it a long while, I fell a bit in love with it all over again. Well worth the price.\n\n2015.10.05: The game is still being updated, but not like it used to. Sadly, the people who worked on the game initially have stated they are "done" with it. Instead, they are working on other projects. Fortunately, they've hired someone to add some new things. That said, the game still has some issues that have really never gotten fixed, but they do occational fixes, so I hope some day they will address it. I think this game still has a big potential, even considering how good it already is.","December 4, 2014","true","657.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

From the lovely chiptune music to the diversity of the classes, to the way the map transforms over time and eventually collapses into the ocean, it's an almost perfect red vs blue game and one of the best retro games I've ever played.\n\nThere are only three classes, but what's so nice about them is they vary in playstyle, skill ceiling, and complexity. This is a game good and bad players can enjoy together. It's a game kids and adults can play against each other.\n\nThe knight is essentially pick up & play, very easy to learn and difficult to cause problems for teammates while learning. The archer is a bit more advanced but allows for players still getting their bearings (or who just aren't very good) to stay reliably out of harm's way while still contributing to the team objective.\n\nFor the advanced player, the builder has a complex range of tools, materials, and duties which are the meat & potatoes of this game, because it's the builder who makes the fortifications and defenses, designs the traps, determines the base layout, and is crucial to the infiltration of the enemy base. There is also resource management to consider here.\n\nAll of this stuff can lead to long contests, and in fact the map can become so wrecked that there's a "map ruined" option under the vote menu. This slow destruction of the level is more fun than it sounds, though. If one side decides to hold out and refuses the reset vote, you'll see pitched battles underwater, hunts in the collapsing and flooding tunnel systems, and probably more drowning than you'll encounter in all your other games combined.\n\nThe end result of all this delicious chaos is a rambling, relaxing mashup of Fat Princess, Ace of Spades, Worms, Terraria; and of course the great forgotten SNES classic King Arthur's World, from which KAG took much of its inspiration.\n\nI cannot lavish enough praise on this game. There's even a solid co-op zombie mod if you haven't tired of zombies yet, complete with deep base building and boss portals to destroy. It's a surprisingly slow-paced and often suspenseful take on the genre, the likes of which we haven't seen since Urban Dead. Certainly not for everyone, but worth mention.\n\nThe rest of this game though - that's for everyone. Nobody should be without KAG. It's as good as multiplayer gets.","June 25, 2014","true","43.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

His shield makes whatever side is being blocked all but invincible, as a well timed heavy attack can bash through! You can also glide and surf with his shield like Lost Vikings! I'd say the Knight is the easiest class to pick up for beginers. It's very easy to start slicing through baddies with this guy and get in some one-shot kills.\nTo a knight in the middle of combat though, the Archer is the preferred class and can snipe long distances, really putting the hurt on the enemy team! Their grappling hook helps them get away in a hurry and they can even fake being dead, so watch out!\nThe final class doesn't get much attention in a standard deathmatch, but really shines in Capture the Flag!\nBring in the Builder class, the real meat behind KAG! This little dude adds an entirely different play-style to the chaotic Knight and Archer classes, though there's just as much depth to the building aspect as the combat.\nHis role is much more strategic. The Builder can build walls, lay down structures to improve a classes loadout and even throw together some very impressive spike traps and rake in the kills!\nThe Builder is a bit less exciting than the other classes and has the highest learning curve. You'll have to gather resources for everything you build by digging up stone and gathering wood from fallen trees, so learning the proper amount needed for a specific structure is key!\n\nIf you'd like to see some of the basic game mechanics, check out my First Look (it's a lot older than this review) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYlN4485BI&index=7\n\nOverall I'd say KAG is a fantastic game! It's very designed and you can tell a lot of love went into this project. If you're into pixel games and looking for something fast-paced and fun in a chaotic way, this game is perfect for you! And the price can't be beat for the amount of content.","July 5, 2014","true","41.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Great game and great concept.  The game is great as is, but has so much potential, to be even better.\n\nPros:\n-On the fly, tower/castle construction/maintenance, while battle is actively occurring. Placing a great sense of urgency on maintaining your stronghold\n-Research and development of weapons\n-Option to change classes without the need to wait for death\n-Attack from Land, Air, Sea, or underground\n\nCons:\n-Griefers sometimes ruin your experience and there isn't a great way get rid of them. Especially if it is a group of them. Voting to kick a griefer will get you kicked instead.\n-Setting up your own server isn't very easy (unlike Soldat).  The process is kind of convoluted. I've tried following guides, but the servers never appear to work properly.  Not sure if the issue is due to the Steam version.\n-Current version doesn't have map building/editor. (You must use the Classic version from the website, not available on Steam)\n-Some maps appear to be too small\n-Resources are some times too sparse.  Making limiting game play on a map\n\n\nWants for future patches:  (If I can, I can learn how to properly set up a server/mod server, I will try to implement some of these ideas)\n-Tunneling based maps\n-Option for team damage (ie. prevent bomb jumping)\n-Option for Larger Maps and to be able to building higher. (This may also give more options to use Aerial equipment\n-Option for Short keys for changing equipment\n-More Building material options\n-More classes\n-More weapons/equipment options (ie. options to jump higher, besides trampoline/catapult)\n-Wish maps had more options to create pits\n-It would be cool to see an implementation of molten lava, may be create a volcano/geyser","April 10, 2014","true","77.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is utterly fantastic. Normally when you buy a game for 8 or 9 pounds you expect to get a few hours of decent entertainment before moving on, yet King Arthur's gold has a certain charm which draws you back in like a fish to a worm.\nThe replayability is amazing, one game you might be a daring knight in shining armor, storming the enemy defences and claiming their flag.\nNext you are an archer, high above the battlefield swinging from tree to tree on your trusty grappling hook raining fire and destruction upon those who were born to stay on the ground.\nFinanly you a builder, brave yet smart, building tunnels and traps for your team on the front line, or providing shops for the battle-ready knights and archers to use at their disposal.\nWhat i'm trying to say is, this is the best pixelated multiplayer game you will ever play, unless ofc they release King Arthur's gold 2.\nThe only bad thing about this game is certain members of the community who decide to ruin the day for others, and there are no beginner servers, so learning the ropes is hard, unless you ask for help! :) 10/10","May 23, 2014","true","514.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

From the lovely chiptune music to the diversity of the classes, to the way the map transforms over time and eventually collapses into the ocean, it's an almost perfect red vs blue game and one of the best retro games I've ever played.\n\nThere are only three classes, but what's so nice about them is they vary in playstyle, skill ceiling, and complexity. This is a game good and bad players can enjoy together. It's a game kids and adults can play against each other.\n\nThe knight is essentially pick up & play, very easy to learn and difficult to cause problems for teammates while learning. The archer is a bit more advanced but allows for players still getting their bearings (or who just aren't very good) to stay reliably out of harm's way while still contributing to the team objective.\n\nFor the advanced player, the builder has a complex range of tools, materials, and duties which are the meat & potatoes of this game, because it's the builder who makes the fortifications and defenses, designs the traps, determines the base layout, and is crucial to the infiltration of the enemy base. There is also resource management to consider here.\n\nAll of this stuff can lead to long contests, and in fact the map can become so wrecked that there's a "map ruined" option under the vote menu. This slow destruction of the level is more fun than it sounds, though. If one side decides to hold out and refuses the reset vote, you'll see pitched battles underwater, hunts in the collapsing and flooding tunnel systems, and probably more drowning than you'll encounter in all your other games combined.\n\nThe end result of all this delicious chaos is a rambling, relaxing mashup of Fat Princess, Ace of Spades, Worms, Terraria; and of course the great forgotten SNES classic King Arthur's World, from which KAG took much of its inspiration.\n\nI cannot lavish enough praise on this game. There's even a solid co-op zombie mod if you haven't tired of zombies yet, complete with deep base building and boss portals to destroy. It's a surprisingly slow-paced and often suspenseful take on the genre, the likes of which we haven't seen since Urban Dead. Certainly not for everyone, but worth mention.\n\nThe rest of this game though - that's for everyone. Nobody should be without KAG. It's as good as multiplayer gets.","June 25, 2014","true","43.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The fighting mechanics are decent as you can be a knight an unstopable killing force with bombs at your disposal. Or you can be an archer who has a grappling hook that you can use to parkour around and shoot people from trees. You can also crouch as an archer which makes you look like your dead so I have feighed my death many times to get past enemy lines. Lastly you can be a builder to make traps with spikes or make a castle for the rest of your team and then change classes while your traps rack up kills.\nIn General these are the good things about this game.\nGood combat: If you have decent amount of skill you can pretty much be a god with a sword or an Archer who can parkour around.\nFun Buildings: Spikes, tree choppers, catapults, ballistas, those are the buildings in the game that you can use to farm kills and make an impenatrable fortress.\nFlaws of this Game\nNeeds a Larger Community: More players! It is rare to find a game with more than 8 people in it, Even then those eight people will leave and their is no-one to replace them.\nUpgrade Mechanic. You have to vote to choose what upgrades to use, and the system is somewhat difficult for a team to decide what to use.

The fighting mechanics are decent as you can be a knight an unstopable killing force with bombs at your disposal. Or you can be an archer who has a grappling hook that you can use to parkour around and shoot people from trees. You can also crouch as an archer which makes you look like your dead so I have feighed my death many times to get past enemy lines. Lastly you can be a builder to make traps with spikes or make a castle for the rest of your team and then change classes while your traps rack up kills.\nIn General these are the good things about this game.\nGood combat: If you have decent amount of skill you can pretty much be a god with a sword or an Archer who can parkour around.\nFun Buildings: Spikes, tree choppers, catapults, ballistas, those are the buildings in the game that you can use to farm kills and make an impenatrable fortress.\nFlaws of this Game\nNeeds a Larger Community: More players! It is rare to find a game with more than 8 people in it, Even then those eight people will leave and their is no-one to replace them.\nUpgrade Mechanic. You have to vote to choose what upgrades to use, and the system is somewhat difficult for a team to decide what to use. This may have been an old bug but You are unable to build the mounted bow turret.\nOverall this is a good game with the steam sale and the fighting mechanics you shoud try it.","June 20, 2015","true","18.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Well there's a damn good reason! This game is so addicting and has great, intense, multiplayer combat. You can be one of three classes in the normal game (un-modded) which seems like not a lot, but it adds to the pure simplicity of the game. You can be the knight, the builder, or the archer. Each class is good for every different person, builder if you like designing, an impentrable castle with many traps (and you cry when the enemy obliterates it), knight if you like gliding around with your shield and killing everything that stands in your way, and an archer to shoot your enemies from afar (whether it be luck or skill). Each class can be offensive or defensive. The builder is actually really dangerous when protected, as they can mine through castle walls and bring the entire thing down. The knight can act defensively, as they can just land on people outside the wall and kill them instantly. The archer is very easily both, if you get a good push going the archer acts as support, if not, the archer barrages the enemy knights with arrows. So there are the class descriptions for you. And I know this game looks like terraria, but it's not. Anyway, buy this game!","February 9, 2014","true","167.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It can be annoying at first but trust me, you'll get used to it. The annoying thing for me at first was to get used to the attacking moves and the buildings confused me. But like I said after a bit you get used and you flow through it all. You can be a knight, archer and a builder & there are also catapults and so on. You'll be switching in between them and since it's team based game the engineers work together more or less when designing the base, defenses and so on. Capture the flag is awesome.\n\nThe land gets shaped and destroyed as the match advances. The most annoying part for me actually is the day/night cycle when I play during the day because of all the light in the room, it's hard to see stuff when it's pitch dark in game, but 90% of the servers don't run the day/night cycle and it's only set to day so that's good. So it's a must get on its full price, even better on sale.\n\nA few tips though : You'll be carrying around water greandes and explosive ones. The water ones put out fires and stun the enemy and the explosive ones well they create gore. So you gotta tap F to switch in between the nades depending on each one you wanna throw first when you press space bar.

These include people who swap teams just to sabotage, or hackers can glitch through doors, etc. However, when you do have a game full of players interested in playing fairly, it is very satisfying.\n\nI look forward to the developers introducing new classes and blocks some time down the road and how that will change the meta of the game.

The developer continues to promise new features but never delivers. At one point they scrapped the entire game, removed all existing features, and started over.\n\nMost of the early players bought the game because it was advertised that a player versus AI coop zombie mode was about to be released. This was over 2 years ago. Now that has been completely dropped, and the game is not any more finished than it was.\n\nAdditionally, the game is administrated by a group of young friends who have full control over all servers. I was playing 1 v 1 against a friend of mine on a server he physically owned the second day we got the game. Two game admins joined the server, harrassed us, then banned me from the game for breaking an unlisted gameplay rule. They banned my forum account at the same time so I would be unable to appeal. I was able to use my brother-in-law's account to eventually have the ban removed.\n\nThey banned me from the game I had just bought, for breaking an unlisted rule, on a server owned by my friend. The moderator then told us to "♥♥♥♥ off" and used racial slurs. There was a huge public thread on this involving the moderation staff, but they deleted it for damage control.\n\nHere is their admin chat log, search for "yutt" http://logs.kag2d.nl/%23kag/2011-11-25.html\nIt is long and boring, but gives a good deal of insight into the sort of people that will have full control over whether you can play the game. They can permanently ban you from a game you purchased because they don't like your attitude. There is zero oversight from the actual developers.\n\nImagine if your average TF2 community member or server admin could permanently ban you from the entire game. That is the system King Arthur's Gold uses.\n\n\nThey immediately jumped to defend one of their own, like any corrupt group with power I suppose. The system was not changed, and the mod was not punished or stripped of his power.\n\n\nDo not buy this game. Good concept, lazy developer, terrible moderation.\n\nI have over 20 hours in the game before it was put on Steam. I have not played since it was put on Steam for the reasons listed above, in addition to a continued lack of support from the developer. Please read more about this game in the other negative reviews, and elsewhere on the internet. The problems are well documented.","January 1, 2014","false","0.3"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Really, it isn't. The game is only fun of you have a party (8+) of friends, not randoms, to play it with. There is barely any single player content at all, and it's a Team vs. Team type game which is why I said a party of friends, not group of randoms. I'm not into multiplayer games to begin with, and I was hoping it would have at least some single player content, but it doesn't. Just practice levels. The combat is VERY simple, building is as well. That was my biggest turn-off though. It's just hold click, or click. There aren't any different weapons or armor, no skill trees, and very little trading. I'll give the game some more time before I make a final conclusion, but I still will not recommend the game. It just costs too much for a barebones medieval tower defense game that requires 8+ friends in a skype call to enjoy it fully.","January 7, 2015","false","0.5"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","5"

The game has a very competitive fan base and even on the beginner servers it is difficult for beginners to learn from anyone, we just get stomped. When I have made mistakes playing as any of the three classes my team very often responds harshly. Stomp, laugh, repeat is not an enjoyable cycle. I’m not complaining about difficulty, being a fan of Dark Souls and other challenging games, but it is not fun to be belittled while trying to learn the basics.\n\nI also think the build/destruction mechanic is imbalanced, as anything that can be built can be destroyed much faster and easier. This discourages any good fort building and turns most matches into brawls between knights, with little to no strategy involved.\n\nI wanted to like this game, I even bought it for a friend, but it fails to meet my expectations. I’ll still turn it on to brawl sometimes, but it won’t be the class based strategy kind of fun I expected.","December 23, 2013","false","2.2"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","1"

You and your team build a castle to defend either flags or halls(basically conquest mode) and then go and attack the enemy castle. You can build catapults, undermine the castle, scale the walls with a grappling hook, or blow the front gate open and storm in. Every match is unique and it's amazing to see what kind of castles and traps people build. There are three classes, builder archer and knight. The builder sucks at fighting and is pretty much only used to dig tunnels, build castles and ships, and in some cases run up and smack the enemy walls with his hammer. The archer has a bow(duh) and a grappling hook that he can use to climb walls/trees. The knight has a shield and a sword and has an interesting sword mechanic. You can charge up attacks or do quick stabs. You can also block with your shield, but you can get stunned by a heavily charged attack.

It's a game that has definitive objectives and team-based tactics - like TF2 - and has resource mining and block-based building - like Terraria. Of course, the crafting and building is not as deep as Terraria's, nor are there 9 classes like in TF2.\n\nBut it has about the same level of fun as those games if you are willing to learn the game and don't get stuck on a side with the occasional griefer. Which is my main gripe: intentional, and even unintentional, griefing is a problem. Powder kegs, used to blow up the enemy base, can blow up your own, even if they were bought and used by your own teammates. And, currently, the vote-kick ability still requires the whole server to cast a majority vote against the offender, which means if the other team isn't feeling very sportsmanlike, they can vote 'no' to the kick.\n\nThe learning curve means that some people, usually newer players, may accidentally cause damage or waste resources. It's not a very steep learning curve, but it's enough of one that it's not as easy to pick up and play as TF2.\n\nAnd there's a few minor problems, notably the fluid-based physics (water spills into empty areas in scientifically impossible ways, expanding into lower regions without actually moving downward, thus multiplying and spreading over more and more tiles as obstructions are removed rather than simply moving to obey gravity).\n\nFor the price, definitely worth it.","December 9, 2013","true","237.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game has a lot to work to go yet- a match making system that allows for friends to team up, a feeling of progression or record keeping so you can boost at you kd spread  an there still seems like there are features missing.

It is a grate medieval platform sandbox sorta like Minecraft. You play in teams and build and destroy castles. There are several gamemodes but 1 thing I dont like is that there is no offline gameplay exept the challange one wich is all the same every time and its really boring and short. The Multyplayer on the other hand is very good but also hard to master!

Everything you build must be practical and structurally sound, and it has to hold up to a keg explosion or 15 or so.\n\nThe important part to remember is that it won't.

I enjoy the insanity that can go on in a match. The game can turn a reasonably-pretty forest with a lake into nothing but a colossal crater.\n\nPositives\n+ The way the game is made allows for good strategic decisions, as well as teamwork.\n+ There's something satisfying about running up to a well-defended enemy bunker with a lit powder keg on your back, just charging towards the bunker for a tactical suicide. I was the only one on my team that ever did that, yet most of my team members would buy powder kegs just to give to me to grab it and charge at the next wall.\n+ It actually has a pretty good combat system, much to my surprise.\n\nNegatives\n- Once you've played one round you've played them all. (The main reason I stopped playing the game was because I played a round that was in a stalemate for 3 hours. It was just such a good round, that when we won, every round I played after that felt inferior and boring in comparison.)\n- Playing as a Worker for more than the 60-second setup phase is stressful, and boring compared to playing as the guy that can use his shield as a makeshift glider. (There are on average less workers on a team, so one worker's working is much more influential on the team than a single warrior. I didn't want to be that guy on the team that just gets everyone else killed because he built the bridge poorly.)\n\nAll-in-all, fun and strategic game, but it doesn't have too long of a life. I played it for 11 hours, but I'm probably not going to go back to it.","January 23, 2014","true","11.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I'll edit or post a thread if a major update/change occurs.\n\nKing Arthur's Gold is a game heavily centered and based upon medival warfare, construction, laying siege, and absolute blissful chaos. Oh god, the chaos that you can create in this game... but more on chaos later. Players can choose from three different classes: The knight, archer, or builder.\n\nThe heavyset, well-armed knight, armed with a glimmering sword and gleaming shield, clad in polished armor. Those who encounter him flee in terror as he combines his strength and swordplay to mercilessly slaughter his enemies, and his large amount of hitpoints and rugged shield taking blows and blasts away from him, making him an effective tank. The knight can bring chaos to the battlefield with his array of explosives to stun, harm, and destroy enemy fortifications or enemy warriors. He is truly a fearsome sight, and the very core of KAG (King Arthur's Gold). He is mainly an OFFENSIVE CLASS.\n\nThe archer is a stealthy assassin, almost the opposite of a knight. He is more frail, but his agility and swift ranged attacks make up for it. He uses his stealth, agility, and ranged weaponry to silently take out targets and provide both defense and offense by firing off a volley of deadly arrows, or by stealthily eliminating players and traversing deeper into enemy territory. He is not a terrible sight, as many players will drop dead, riddled with arrows before they can lay eyes on the archer. Those who encounter them can ensure a swift death if the player is skilled enough. He is mainly a DEFENSIVE CLASS\n\nThe builder is a saboteur and master... builder :D, well versed in the art of construction, trap making, and sabotage. WIth his trusty hammer, he can construct wonderous things, from shops to siege engines to ingenious, deadly traps. Players may understimate him and laught at the pickaxe that the builder wields, and will soon have their laughter cut short as their entire castle comes crashing down onto their faces. Their laughter will be cut short once the master saboteur brings a fleet of ballistas, explosive bolts armed and ready, at their front door. The builder is a great support class, and is centered around both DEFENSE AND OFFENSE, with his ability to create great defensive structures and his sabotaging skill. He is a SUPPORT CLASS.\n\nThe hammer and pickaxe are not that complex, and so I have decided to leave them out for now. More details are in the KAG wiki as always :)\n\nHIGHLIGHTS: In KAG, you can build a massive castle, drop boulders on peoples faces, effectively destroying them, explode enemies to giblets with bombs, dive bomb people by parachuting and dropping a keg as a knight, hug trees, make friends with sharks, ride bison, recieve a friendly faceful of shrapnel and stone, take a volley of arrows for your team, bomb jump and fly like a pro, cackle as your enemies fall into a millsaw, have your drill stolen and recieve a warm welcome from Death as your enemy shoves 40 tons of writhing steel into your back, load a catapult with basically anything, participate in trench warfare, hug trees and grass, sleep amid nice shubbery as your allies scream in agony and beg for help, and so much more. Lauching your self from a catapult? Yes. Lobbing corpses at people like the Mongols did? Yes. Do an action hero pose and fly across the entire map by bomb jumping? Yes. Rain Death onto peasants? Yes. Be rejected by bison and have a meal with a shark? Yes. Engage in pirate warfare? Yes. Mentally slap yourself as ballista bolts rain upon you because you forgot to cover up your siege engine factory and the enemy bought a ballista and about 20,000 bolts? Yes. Light a keg too early and destroy your entire base, the chat being filled with "wow"s and "gg"s? Yes. There is so much to do in this game, all based on blissful chaos and medival warfare. Whether you like silently plotting, constructing castles, and sabotaging traps, or simply blowing up and stabbing people while whistling "A Bicycle Built For Two", this is the game for you.\n\nThank you for taking your time to read this review so far. I'm not nearly done though, so read more if you want to :)\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nFinally, we get to the actual... gaming.\n\nAssuming your computer isn't a potato with an antenna stuck into it (I've tried that once. It doesnt make a good computer, but the framerate is acceptable.), you first lauch the KAG client. This will allow you to configure some things before starting the game, which you do by pressing "PLAY". You are then greeted by the menu of KAG, for Solo gameplay, Multiplayer (the major part of KAG), and settings.\n\nSolo contains some fun little challenges to compete with others, a mini campaign to get the gist of the game, and a sandbox mode to test your skills and build freely without tree people (archers), exploding men (knights) and mountain men (builders, esp. if they are with a boulder) yelling their heads off at you. Only joking the community is nice if you know where to look, unlike the claims that some people are making. There is also a tutorial mode, where you can learn the basic controls, and some information about gamemodes.\n\nMultiplayer is the core of KAG gameplay, and most of the gameplay you see in a trailer or on Youtube, and the most fun, as Solo only has a mini-campaign, tutorials, a sandboxmode, and challenges. The match starts with a several minute long, short building period, which you should use well. Use this time to first mine resources, like gold for siege and boat factories and upgrades, wood for practically everything, including workshops (generic buildings that you can convert into unique buidlings), and stone for better fortifications and some other shops for workshops. Build fortifications to cover your flags or halls, depending on whether you play Capture The Flag or Take The Halls (CTF and TTH). My tip is to mine tons of stone, and then make towers over your objectives (flags/halls).\n\nIn conclusion, KAG is an extremely fun strategic and chaotic game for those who love strategy and sabotage, medieval siege, and absolute chaos. The graphics are similar to Terraria, but nowhere near a Terraria clone. I rate 9/10, some improvements being servers with better ping, more players, and some more maps where you can use boats. This game is great and I strongly recommend buying it. It is worth its price.\n\nThank you so much for reading my review, it means so much to me. I hope this game you a vivid picture of the proness of KAG, and I hope you will enjoy playing it if you do decide to buy it.\n\nHAPPY KAGing! THATS NOT A VERB BUT IT DOESNT MATTER! :D\n\n\n\n","December 29, 2015","true","12.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

If you think you'd really like that, that's cool, but I'm personally not too crazy about it from the time I've spent on it and the observations of my friends who've played it more than I have. Caveat emptor applies pretty damn strongly here: the game is neat in conception, but not so much in execution. Unless you're willing to put up with all of the following, I would not recommend this game.\n\nThere are three classes: knights, archers and builders. Archers fire arrows, builders are in charge of managing (destructible) team fortifications and catapults to attack the enemy base with. Knights are the front-line class, and...they're kind of overpowered. I do not say that lightly. It's entirely possible for a skilled knight to continually decimate a good portion of your team. That's not game-sinking by itself, but it's also entirely possible for said skilled knight(s) to bomb-jump right over your castle and start camping your spawn. By the time they finally die, they've probably earned enough gold from killing your team to buy a good number of base-destroying bombs, and his team's builders have had leeway to set up multiple catapults.\n\nKAG's learning curve is fairly steep, even for me, but that wouldn't be as much of an issue if knights were weaker, and more importantly if the game's community was large and vibrant. It's not. It's fairly small and pretty toxic, even for a niche competitive game. This is a problem that Pirates, Vikings & Knights II also suffers from, but at least that game is relatively easier to understand and very engaging at times, not to mention the recent increase in updates to that game has resulted in somewhat of a boost to its player base.\n\nThis game is also rather buggy, but I consider that a minor issue compared to the others I've talked about here. Really, it's more of a combination of all these things that prevent KAG from reaching greatness. At any rate, I hope you are now an informed customer and will decide wisely.","February 16","false","1.6"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","2"

I was so excited to play this game - we went and bought a bunch of copies for my friends and I.\n\nUnfortunately, it's very problematic to actually play. Tons of UI inconveniences - for instance, to load the catapult, you use the E button. But if you just tap E, it removes the wheels from the catapult. Because, yes, totally, I wanted to break my seige weapon instead of loading it. Want to do a challenge? Well, just pick the challenges option, and get thrown into all of them, one after another, with no way to pick the one you want to try. Sandbox mode? Build whatever you want! .... except the map has no water, so none of the boat stuff, and is insanely tiny, so you can't hardly get any resources to build stuff. What's the point of sandbox mode if you've got no resources and no place to put things?\n\nAlso, the sandbox mode prepared me for one type of building - and then, in actual multiplayer, the entire process of how you build was completely different. There wasn't any way to practice ahead of time. Again, what's the point of sandbox, then?\n\nThere's a lot to love about this game, and I'm definitely going to come back - I'll give it a few months? If they polish it, refine it, and make it the game it deserves to be, I'll be a fan for life.\n\nAs is?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/averageape/recommended/219830/","averageape","avgAPE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/averageape/","39 products in account","When I first bought KAG well over a year ago, when the game was still in alpha, I too thought it was an amazing game. However, anyone new to the game will quickly be greated by an utterly atrocious community and even worse developers. This has resulted in, as many of the negative reviews have already stated, two overwhelming problems: griefing and banning.\n\nFor starters, the devs have not implemeted, nor do they appear willing to implement, an in game mechanic which prevents members of one team from joining the enemy team during a game. This creates a situation in which there are no consequences for players who abuse the game by griefing the opposing team. As such, being the lazy developers they are, the devs have turned enforcement of in-game rules over to the community, who in turn "solved" this problem by simply banning any behaviour which can in any slight degree be regarded as griefing. The result is one of the worst experiences for a new player that I have ever witnessed. You see, as a noob, one is just learning the game and can sometimes make mistakes... big mistakes. This leads to noobs being misconstrued as griefers and subsequently being banned from servers thus adding to the already significant problem of griefing in general.\n\nThis has created an environment in which the community responds very negatively to new players and is often times unwilling to allow, or help, a noob to learn. I have been banned simply for saying that I was a noob and sorry for any mistake I have made. In a way, the community cannot be blammed for this as the experienced players have no way of telling who is actually being honest and who is a griefer, but the problem with the community still persists and has not gotten any better in the time I have played this game.\n\nTo be fair KAG is actually a very well made from a gameplay standpoint and I really do want to like it. Which is why I wrote the devs months ago to make my concerns known and to inform them that I will no longer play or promote their game in any fashion. I put alot of time into that letter, because I really do care, and apparently my time doesn't even merit a response from the devs which is why I assume they never did. Hell, they probably didn't even read it. Overall, if you can put up with being banned constantly and appealing those bans on the forums over and over again, then this game is for you. But for anyone who actually wants to play a game and not get caught up in the politics of community forums then I cannot in good conscience recommend that anyone spend their hard earned money on this game.\n\nIt should be noted that I have spent many hours in-game during alpha when the game wasn't available on steam and that my hours played as it is displayed on steam is in no way accurate. I have only played it on steam only to see if beta brought about any positive changes, which the devs have sadly failed to do.\n\n\n\n","March 27, 2014","false","0.3"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadjackfr/recommended/219830/","deadjackfr","Deadjack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadjackfr/","898 products in account","King Arthur has a huge gameplay.\nYou can see the vids and the store page to be interrested like me.\nThere are tons of things to do.\nBut in multiplayer... oh god... this is so frustrating to be overwhelmed like that ! [Long review]\n\n\n3 classes: Builder, Knight and Archer.\nQuite simple to grasp the basics with few tutorials.\nYou build a castle with tons of elements in few mins (2 or 3) and go fight the enemy and test its own defenses.\n\nSo where is the problem ? If this rich gameplay has been implemented it's for a good reason, right ?\nIt's because there is too much to handle and the game is absolutely unoptimize.\n\nTake a look at the following....\n\n\nBUILDER:\n\nYou try to build simple defenses. Wood, the weaker, Stone, the strongest. The main  problem is directly link to this class: King Arthur's Gold is not a Sandbox game !  As an example you can't move soils such as dirt. There is no editor, so every maps are design by the developpers. An other problem is you have no wooden traps. The only availiable a retractable spike. It can kill your friends and  you have to build a special block that makes enemies fall through instead of you team. The fact is that you have to spend a huge amount of stones to build a simple trap system. Securing a flag or an entrance is horribly long and quite often you get blocked by the "trap block" because you can't pass through... Even aiming the blocks to build and even digging is hard. You will rant when you will see this little red arrow with a horrible sound to show "you can't build here" (thanks we haven't noticed !!).\nAdd to that the fact that when you missed your clic you can't deconstruct your block.\nVery nice to endure when you are in the fire of the action and a trap needs to be finished in a hurry ! (in general a guy from the opposite team is coming at you...).\n\nAnd it's really, REALLY, annoying to be rushed all the time by "Airborn" knights carrying bombs (Knight after droping a bomb can use his shield to propels him in the airs and glide anywhere holding the shield above him like a hang-glider). And the situation is absolutely obvious when you see a lone guy exploding the walls you put so long to build.\n\nPeople will tell you, you have siege weapons!\nBut you can be propelled with a catapult and again it's a huge boost of mobility. For the non rushing team it's a sentence of death because building siege weapons needs a lot of stone, A LOT (Wood can respawn but it's not the case for stone). And when you die few times in a desperate attempt to repair or rebuild the structures previously destroyed by few kamikaze... you start to be angry.\n\nConsidering the fact that you just can't store the materials you've found for the rest of the team, can't fight correctly as a builder (because you only score points when you kill someone) or even building a decent base at the start (around 3 mins to do it !). You can buy items for the Builder, such as a drill, but like all aspects of the game, nothing mentions that the drill overheat and is unavailiable for few mins. So nobody use it. You can understand how frustrating this game can be as a builder.\n\nKNIGHT:\n\nExhausted of building stuff that won't last more than few mins, you try your luck as a close combat fighter [Not a Kamikaze Knight of course].\nBut it's delightfull to fight and being unable to chain few blows without being overwhelmed by characters and explosions (bobies are persistent and can be picked up, so if someone dies it will block the line of sight of everybody and instead of taking valuables you will take a corpse ...). In general you click in the mass of pixels and hope to reach your target. In the fire of the action you will be unable to see the small hearts of the ennemy (his health of course). Note that if you died you won't have enough money to buy the bombs (you can throw it even before dying to blow everything... Kamikaze Style !).\n\nSo you go to range fight when you have enough of getting killed. If you look deeper on the forums, you will find that some dudes has mouse mods so they can burst you in melee if you are a regular player like me [translation: a fair play man].\n\n\nARCHER:\n\nYou have a bow, you shoot, simple enough ? No.\nConsider the fact that you have a long time to load the arrow, the low damage it does and the fact that you can't see correctly if you damaged the target. You have a special attack wich throws 3 arrows, but the way to use it is so much complicate that you won't us it. Only in close combat if you have luck to land one or two arrows on the target and in general you have a knight in front of you (whe can use the same shield to glide to protect him... yes sir).\n\nYou can use a grappling hook to reach higher locations (by the way it's very hard to build high towers) but this tool is so unaccurate and with a very limited range that quite often you will loose your life in a desperate way to aim/evaluate the distance/ and dodge the incoming foe.\nBomb jump is much better in terms of efficiency and power.\nAdd to that ammunitions, because you have basic and special arrows like the fire one to burn wooden structures or the bomb arrow for stone. An other great way to reduce to ashes the work of Builders...\nSo like all players you won't stay long as an Archer and go Knight.\n\nAgain if you die you will drop some gold the enemy can use to buy ammunitions,\nand if you rush and place shops on the way to the enemy base you will win quickly with continuous Kamikaze Knights...\n\n\nIN GENERAL:\n\nThe concept is appealing but frankly the learning curve is horrible and there is too much content.\nI never thought i would say something like that...\nYou rarely understand why something didn't worked especially during a fight where 2 or 3 secs determines the fate of your character.\nYou have so many game mechanics that you can't handle everything at the same time. As, again, for a Builder you can't extinguish the fire on wooden structures. You have to take an other class and buy a water bomb/ water arrow. So you can't even defend buildings yourself except if you build a balista or a catapult.\nBut like many other games the community doesn't help and explains nothing (the text window is bad, even the dozens of emote icons: players just uses smileys to laugh in front of your death, only one guy used it correctly to say to build a tower on a location).\n\nThere are many cheaters (without any protection against them) and even if some players are really good, we don't know if they use mods.\nThings are quite often unfair like when the maps puts you to the worst location or the overall design is bad.\nEven voting is a pain and disturbs you quite often because there is no timer and you have to vote even if you don't care of it. You can't see if someone has done something wrong, the chat window is small and you have to click on it to enlarge it for few seconds.\n\nTO CONCLUDE:\n\nYou have better multiplayer games for free with much more balance and interrest.\nKing Arthur's Gold is not a sandbox and it's a game where gameplay goes too far and makes the multiplayer messy. You can't manage everything and your team doesn't act with you, in general Builders stays behind away from Knights and Archers, the only classes that can work together naturally.\nYou endure many crashes and latency is often very high. This is related to a bad optimisation of the game and you will need more than an average computer to run it !\nMaybe a major update on the solo mode where you could control you're team or  better stability and more scenarios in multiplayer.\nActually, this game is the only one i've uninstalled after only 5 hours on it...\n\nN.B: I will update this review if the game changes but actually i just can't recommand it.\nAnd be ware, some players are ruining bad reviews to keep the overall good rating of the game.\nBut fact are here: the game is unoptimized, the gameplay clumsy,ect... So buy it at your own risk.","November 30, 2014","false","4.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

You may think that I am being unrealistic to say that this happens in every match, but I assure you... I am not. There is always some idiot who thinks it is funny to knock down a wall you just built, to hold the door open for enemies, to "accidentally" blow up your base; all the while they are using little smiley emoticons.\nAside from this, if you hate playing games with immature jerks who think racism, sexism, foul language, and memes are funny you will HATE the "community" in this game. The majority of the people in this game run around typing racial slurs in all caps and acting like they just learned naughty words for the first time. It's like being stuck playing a game with the people in the Youtube comments section. The one redeeming thing about the communication in this game is that there is no voicechat.\nThe gameplay is fun, however, the people who update it always seem to take away something that was fun or add something that hurts the gameplay with each update. If you are having fun with it, just wait until the next update - you'll find something you hate almost instantly. The updates are barely ever beneficial to the gameplay, considering they never take out the common exploits within the game (such as JABBING) that SHOULD be balanced. They only mess with things that should have never been touched in the first place.\nOnce in a while you will have a fun match with a decent team and you will think "WOW! That was great. I should play again." Stop right there, buddy. If you had one fun game, don't try again. It's like a slot machine. Once in a while you'll win big, but the rest of your spins are going to be a frustrating waste of your time (and imaginary money).\n\nDo yourself a favor.

The game certaily looked a lot of fun and has very interesting mechanics. However, it offers close to no single-player gameplay and relies completely on it's multiplayer, which can be resumed by being on the same room as people who play this for eons and can snipe you without a thought. Only buy if you are interested on being repeatedly murdered by all kinds of things without achieving anything at all before your 1000th death.","March 11","false","1.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","3"

But sadly, this game is too riddled with errors to even call it fun. I spent my first 15 minutes of playing just trying to figure out how to get the game fullscreen (there is no way). Then, I spent around 15 minutes trying to find a game. First, I tried to find a capture the flag game because the forums said this one was the best gamemode... literally no games of it found. I could not find a single good game! They were either full of greifing 12 year olds, required a s***-ton of mods, had terrible ping, or was password locked.\nI am disapointed. A game that looked genre crossing and exited, but was, in fact, made by an inexperienced inde team and was ruined by the players. BUT, BY ALL MEANS DONT BELIVE ME! SPEND $10 TO HAVE A 12 YEAR OLD SPAWN 200 RAFTS IN A GAME LAGGING EVERYONE OUT!\nPlease dont do dis. There are so many good games on steam.

I believe the game is still in its beta so it's to be expected but there are just far too many problems. For one the classes are all unbalanced, mining and building can be tricky and glitchy at times, the servers are laggy and I often disconnect losing all my items collected during the game. I got this game for around $2.50 so it's not a bad deal. I hope they continue to update this game but as far as I know updates do not happen very often. The production company working on this game also has a few other games, which is most likely why they can not update often.\n\nAll and all I would not reccomend this game unless you find it on sale.

It feels to me, like "Fat Princess" as shovelware, because it's gameplay has even LESS DEPTH into it, it's gameplay didn't look too convincing, and this is one of the FEW video games, where it makes me WANT to see King Arthur, as the villain!\nWould I reccomend this? No; mostly because this game's price value is WAY too high, and I would only reccomend it, if it was FREE.

KAG is a tile-based, team-based, competetive multiplayer game that has a variety of things in it that usually contribute to replayability which is a very good thing. There is a high skill cieling which again, is a very good thing but can be unhelpful to new players. To be completely honest this game uses the tile-based mechanic in multiplayer better than moster other games could dream to because of the fact that everything in the game is connected to the tile-based mechanic, unlike other games who make things that would work in a normal multiplayer game but not one with tile-based mechanics. (looking at you Brick-Foce... not that the game has anything else to stand for) If you like slightly team-based games that require skill and have a lot of replayability, then this is the game for you.\n\nPros:\n-Lots of replayability\n-High skill ceiling\n-Fort building\n-Fort collapsing\n-Bloody battles\n-Variety of items\n-Rough resource gathering system\n-Multiple classes (different playstyles and helps the teamwork aspect be true to itself)\n-Multiple gamemodes\n-Seige vehicles\n-Water vehicles\n-Explosions\n-More explosions\n-Did I mention explosions?\n-Singleplayer for testing stuff\n-More players for a indie multiplayer than usual\n\n+/-:\n-Teamwork-based (is a pro for me but some people don't like teamwork-based mechanics)\n-Light music\n\nCons:\n-Bad tutorial\n-More lag problems than most other games\n-Some balancing issues\n-Some bugs\n\nFinal verdict: 8.5/10, if you like multiplayer teamwork-based competetive games that have lots of replayability, (everyone likes replayability) then you should try this game","April 9, 2015","true","158.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This led to me getting killed. A lot.\nThat's when I turned to the Builder class.\nI was great at staying behind our front defenses, and helping to build more defenses aswell.\nHOWEVER, if one of your teammates doesn't like the way you set up a fort, or placed traps, they will take it upon themselves to destroy what you built, and place their own structures. If you are new to the game and don't have a lot of experience with setting up traps or building defenses, I suggest you STAY AWAY from Multiplayer for at least 30 minutes of gameplay. Familiarize yourself with how this game works, or you will be called an idiot in Multiplayer.\nThis was my experience, and I hope you learn not to make the same mistake I did.","June 12, 2015","false","1.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

I love the ideas of building epic structures and working together with your team to take them down with siege weaponry and cunning, unfortunately this is not usually how the matches end up. You'll go into a game hoping to create a grand structure, but you'll be one of two, or maybe the only, builder and it's just not possible to build anything large by yourself, you simply can't gather and hold enough resources to create it before the enemy shows up. And then they do... wave after wave of knights carrying keg bombs, just laying waste to your creations. Who needs a catapult when a cheap as dirt explosive does twice the damage? It's stupid, makes no sense, and ruins most matches. Then there's the lag, I'm not sure if it's happening to anyone else, but i meet the requirements to run the game and it does run very smoothly when I'm playing alone, but then i hit the servers and it all goes to hell. The match will start off fairly smooth, but then it will degrade as the match goes on. By the end I'm moving at slideshow speeds of a frame every couple seconds. MY ping is between 30-100 most days so i really don't know what's going on. I really have to wonder how people with higher pings even manage to stomach it. I tried turning on faster graphics and that literally made things worse, when it is supposed to speed them up. I find it difficult to recommend the game, but i will as if the problems i've described are fixed it will be a great title. Right now as it stands it's either fun as hell or oh-my-god-someone-give-me-a-gun-I'm-going-to-kill-that-son-of-a- kind of experience depending on your luck at the servers. So if we could just raise the cost of keg bombs, decrease their damage, get a bigger player base, and fix the framerates this game would be excellent.","January 23, 2014","true","33.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I watched the video, which seems to be purposely a bit campy, and it sold me. King Arther's Gold is one of the few games on Steam I paid full price for and I was not disappointed. This game has some history and has seen several revisions before it hit Steam. There already seems to be a fairly established online community of gamers so finding a populated server hasn't been an issue for me.\n\nKing Arthur's Gold is a 2d online pvp game where two teams build up their base and attempt to destroy the opponent's. The game features four game modes: capture the flag, team deathmatch, take the halls, and challenges. There is also a single player gamemode called "Save the Princess" which I have not played as I assumed this game is multiplayer in it's focus. Capture the Flag and Team Deathmatch are fairly common in pvp games so I won't explain them. Take the Halls is essentially point control. Challenges vary map to map but this mode digresses from the other three as Challenge maps often pit players against NPC oppoonents.\n\nCapture the Flag matches tend to last around 30-40 minutes. Take the Hall matches tend to take a lot longer (upwards of 2 hours). I have noticed this game can get a bit unstable after a few hours of gametime and/or with matches with lots of people.\n\nThe mayhem advertised in the video is absolutely accurate and I highly recommend playing this game.\n\nScore: 9/10\n","December 3, 2013","true","29.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I love the ideas of building epic structures and working together with your team to take them down with siege weaponry and cunning, unfortunately this is not usually how the matches end up. You'll go into a game hoping to create a grand structure, but you'll be one of two, or maybe the only, builder and it's just not possible to build anything large by yourself, you simply can't gather and hold enough resources to create it before the enemy shows up. And then they do... wave after wave of knights carrying keg bombs, just laying waste to your creations. Who needs a catapult when a cheap as dirt explosive does twice the damage? It's stupid, makes no sense, and ruins most matches. Then there's the lag, I'm not sure if it's happening to anyone else, but i meet the requirements to run the game and it does run very smoothly when I'm playing alone, but then i hit the servers and it all goes to hell. The match will start off fairly smooth, but then it will degrade as the match goes on. By the end I'm moving at slideshow speeds of a frame every couple seconds. MY ping is between 30-100 most days so i really don't know what's going on. I really have to wonder how people with higher pings even manage to stomach it. I tried turning on faster graphics and that literally made things worse, when it is supposed to speed them up. I find it difficult to recommend the game, but i will as if the problems i've described are fixed it will be a great title. Right now as it stands it's either fun as hell or oh-my-god-someone-give-me-a-gun-I'm-going-to-kill-that-son-of-a- kind of experience depending on your luck at the servers. So if we could just raise the cost of keg bombs, decrease their damage, get a bigger player base, and fix the framerates this game would be excellent.","January 23, 2014","true","33.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Gaming_Bur/recommended/219830/","The_Gaming_Bur","The Gaming Bur©","http://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Gaming_Bur/","279 products in account","To start, let me be frank: If you like (a) class based, hack-N-Slash, Terraria/TF2/Stronghold type game(s), then you will definitely enjoy King Arthur's Gold (a.k.a. KAG).\n\nNow, let me explain exactly why you'll enjoy this game: It's just plain dumb fun and perfect for close-knit gaming between a group of friends. Don't get me wrong though, hopping in a random server and just playing to your heart's content is just as fun too!\n\nThere are several different game modes, all of which are very rewarding and fun to take part in. I can't necessarily choose a favorite. There is CTF, "Take The Halls" ( similar to capture-points), Team Deathmatch and a few others. For the most part, people mainly seem to play the two prior game-types, but that's okay. Those are, I would easily say, the most fun.\n\nThere are three classes to choose from in KAG: Builder, Knight and Archer.\n\nThe Knight is your mainstay, hack'N'slash, kill-them-all-before-they-can-regroup type player. With his shield, not only can he infinitely dodge arrows and sword strikes (as long as you're facing the right way.. be warned.. lol) but he can also use it as a convenient kite to gently glide down treaterous falls from high cliffs and walls. Moreso, he can also do the invert by using his shield as a sort of surf board to skip across large bodies of water (.... or, land ...... yes... land.. it's awesome), even if/when launched out of a catapault (.. !!! ..)\n\nThe Archer is just what you'd expect, and more. The Archer is the only [certified badass] class which has available to him a grappling hook. He can scale walls, climb trees or just swing under an over-hang of a cliff and lob arrows into unsuspecting faces. He's very weak though, considering he has no means to defend himself, and you have to charge his arrows to fire. Did I mention, if you charge it long enough, you can get an attackk boost and fire three arrows in rapid succession? You can do a similar thing with the Knight (doing two large swings in succession, rather than simple stabs at the enemy)\n\nThe Builder is the back-bone of every team, being the ONLY class that is able to fortify and defend points by constructing wood or stone walls. They are also the ONLY class that can build player huts: specific types of huts pertaining to the different classes (and sometimes all of them; the bakery is a wonderful place to replenish much needed HP from a fresh, juicy burger or three!!). The Builder can also distribute tools and with their siege huts, other players can order equipment such as catapults, ships and other various equipment to help them utterly decimate any and all opposition!!\n\n\nIf you like Terraria, if you like playing as an engineer in TF2, if you like the castle building aspects of Stronghold, if you enjoy playing a tank in your favorite hack'n'slash or if you just enjoy dumbass, fun indie games: pick this game up, now.\n\nThe one downside to this game: if you are NOT familiar with any of the previously mentioned games or game genres, then the learning curve is slightly above average. The only reason being is that the controls are only as adaptive as Terraria. In particular, the builder class is the only trully, somwhat difficult class to play. The one reason is that it can be a little finicky to select items on the map and pick things up, but it isn't impossible to do so by any means.\n\nOn the other hand, the tutorials are a great place to start figuring things out and are very helpful and informative. If you play with a friend or people who you know who have already played or own it, then you would have no problem at all learning the easy way how to do all the things KAG has to offer. When in doubt, ask a friend!\n\nSo, If your'e still greatly interested, but perhaps slightly hesitant to buy this game by the end of reading this recommendation, let me just finish with this: If you even relatively like or enjoy any of those similar aspects from other games and genres- for $10, KAG is definitely a game you'll get your money's worth.","November 11, 2013","true","30.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And then they do... wave after wave of knights carrying keg bombs, just laying waste to your creations. Who needs a catapult when a cheap as dirt explosive does twice the damage? It's stupid, makes no sense, and ruins most matches. Then there's the lag, I'm not sure if it's happening to anyone else, but i meet the requirements to run the game and it does run very smoothly when I'm playing alone, but then i hit the servers and it all goes to hell. The match will start off fairly smooth, but then it will degrade as the match goes on. By the end I'm moving at slideshow speeds of a frame every couple seconds. MY ping is between 30-100 most days so i really don't know what's going on. I really have to wonder how people with higher pings even manage to stomach it. I tried turning on faster graphics and that literally made things worse, when it is supposed to speed them up. I find it difficult to recommend the game, but i will as if the problems i've described are fixed it will be a great title. Right now as it stands it's either fun as hell or oh-my-god-someone-give-me-a-gun-I'm-going-to-kill-that-son-of-a- kind of experience depending on your luck at the servers. So if we could just raise the cost of keg bombs, decrease their damage, get a bigger player base, and fix the framerates this game would be excellent.","January 23, 2014","true","33.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yutt/recommended/219830/","yutt","yutt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yutt/","853 products in account","WARNING: DO NOT BUY\n\nThe game has been in an alpha state for over 2 years. The developer continues to promise new features but never delivers. At one point they scrapped the entire game, removed all existing features, and started over.\n\nMost of the early players bought the game because it was advertised that a player versus AI coop zombie mode was about to be released. This was over 2 years ago. Now that has been completely dropped, and the game is not any more finished than it was.\n\nAdditionally, the game is administrated by a group of young friends who have full control over all servers. I was playing 1 v 1 against a friend of mine on a server he physically owned the second day we got the game. Two game admins joined the server,  harrassed us, then banned me from the game for breaking an unlisted gameplay rule. They banned my forum account at the same time so I would be unable to appeal. I was able to use my brother-in-law's account to eventually have the ban removed.\n\nThey banned me from the game I had just bought, for breaking an unlisted rule, on a server owned by my friend. The moderator then told us to "♥♥♥♥ off" and used racial slurs. There was a huge public thread on this involving the moderation staff, but they deleted it for damage control.\n\nHere is their admin chat log, search for "yutt" http://logs.kag2d.nl/%23kag/2011-11-25.html\nIt is long and boring, but gives a good deal of insight into the sort of people that will have full control over whether you can play the game. They can permanently ban you from a game you purchased because they don't like your attitude. There is zero oversight from the actual developers.\n\nImagine if your average TF2 community member or server admin could permanently ban you from the entire game. That is the system King Arthur's Gold uses.\n\n\nThey immediately jumped to defend one of their own, like any corrupt group with power I suppose. The system was not changed, and the  mod was not punished or stripped of his power.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=9843221\n\nDo not buy this game. Good concept, lazy developer, terrible moderation.\n\nI have over 20 hours in the game before it was put on Steam. I have not played since it was put on Steam for the reasons listed above, in addition to a continued lack of support from the developer. Please read more about this game in the other negative reviews, and elsewhere on the internet. The problems are well documented.","December 31, 2013","false","0.2"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","13","28","0","0"

The single players modes works as a tutorial for the multiplayer games.\n\nSome players could have a bad time trying the game since many things are learned by trial and error on multiplayer games. Is hard to enjoy a "sandbox" game with this style of gameplay.\n\nI consider is only advisable for people that wants short session of MOBA with some sandbox concepts like terraria. Don't excpect this game to be a sandbox or a simulation game because you will be very dissapointed.\n\nIf you are looking for a solo experience, i recomend you "Craft the World"","December 6, 2013","false","3.2"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","12","26","0","4"

Its core gameplay is pretty good I guess, but the game in general seems a little... Lacking. There are only 3 classes, and that's not that bad. There is also a pitiful amount to do in single player. Let's say that you're power is out. You dont know when it'll be back online. Uh-oh! Let's go onto the laptop and play some King Arthur's Gold. You play for 10 minutes and you finish the campaign. Well that sucks. That's the whole single player experience. Right there. There's local play, which is okay, in itself, but there is also no single-player vs. AI mode, meaning that you HAVE to play online. That sucks because it is the only way to play the dang game. So, the power's back up! Yay! You go online and... Oh. Nobody is ever really playing this. So, the biggest your tiny little TDM match you'll ever get is probably about 3v3. Keep in mind, 6 people. Wheh! 6 people! THAT. IS. SOOOOOOOOOOO MANY PEOPLE. Look past the crappy user count, and then there is a pvp terraria-like game that has 95% less content.\n\nFinal score- 4/10: There are many good things about this game- The character skins, the gameplay, the maps, the balanced EVERYTHING *side note: There are NO overpowered items, other than maybe siege weapons, but those are expensive as heck*, the crafting systems, but those are countered in excess by the game's cons.\n\nNotes for Developers:\nGreat game so far, it has a lot of potential, but really just doesn't make the cut, content-wise.  A few requests: Like I said-    Single-Player vs. AI mode, Steam Workshop mod support, more classes, like maybe a wizard or something, some more blocks, some more map variety, like maybe a dead forest, an overcast field, y'know, for ambience, and, maybe, custom loadouts that might do things like raise an archer's arrow speed, but make them do less damage (These would work pretty well with the afore mentioned workshop support *nudge nudge*),but, that's just about it.\n\nNotes For Everyone:\nWow. That was a LOT of rambling. If this is like your favorite game ever, I'm sorry, I may have exaggerated a bit about the Terraria thing. Really, not that similar the more I think about it. I was refering to the build system and the 2-D retro graphics. Anyway, hope you have a great day and I didn't ruin it :p.","July 31, 2015","false","3.0"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","46","11","24","3","0"

Terraria combined with the combat from castle crashers, in multiplayer with Capture The Flag. Although fights doesn't feel satisfying, the element of building your 2D makeshift castlefort (for the team?) brings a grin to my face for every spike-impaled kill I earn. Friend or foe, if you falling through that trap door that took me 5 minutes of clicking on a potato-video sized pixel to gather and build, I earned the right to make you respawn again.\n\nThere are 3 classes you can switch to, in base and with no appended respawn time. Archers, for artillery support, knights for frontline infantry, and builders for defense and utilities.\n\nKnight combat on its own, without limited items like bombs to aid you, feels like a samurai duel, where if you swing first you better do more consecutive damage on the follow up, to kill him before he kills you.\n\nArchers feels like Benjamin franklin kiting away from the inevitable lightning from Zeus, however if you sneeze at the right time, you might hurt the sky, I just shoot up and hope it lands on someone, cause knights just raise their shields and I can't really do much on this guy.\n\nBob the builder (my favorite class), has the power to build a series of workshops that introduces the little tribal village of your team to mercantilism. Think of it as a tech tree class for your civilization, except you, the urban planner won't get paid for the layouts, nor the progression of your tribe's conquest. You are a humble servant that fills his needs by serving the land for your team. Scavenging the rocks from the ground, and the berries in the trees, wishfully thinking maybe one day your team might meander far enough to bring home the flag of the enemy.\n\nThis is medieval soldat, but a balanced complete 2D destructibility, where players actively repairs and grow the base, this is a game for you. For 3 bucks it's a steal.","June 17, 2015","true","2.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

There are 4 gamemodes which are all fun that you can enjoy,this also improves replayibility since if you are bored of a gamemode you can switch to the other. The game has 3 classes.Builder: Who is there to mine the stone and the gold,chop down the forest and build a castle,protect the place,set up traps,There is a knight who is there for the fight and there is an archer who usually supports the knights with his arrows and helps the team. You can buy explosives (Capture the flag) or do research,and make factories and wait for them to make your own stuff (Take the Halls) There are only 2 classes (Archer and Knight) in 2 gamemodes (Challenge and Team Deathmatch) since it wouldnt make sense to build in Challenges( Parkours etc) and Team Deathmatch. However Take The Halls is some kinda Team Deathmatch with builders and places to capture. While in Capture The Flag you have to defend your own base and its flags and bring the other teams flags and there are no factories and you buy stuff unlike Take The Halls. There are Siege Units and lots of other things you can enjoy.

It takes the building mechanics of Terraria, mashes it in with blood lust and vehicles, and then adds just a touch of- oh no- that is way more than a touch! IT IS FREAKING CHAOTIC AND INSANE AND FUN!  I can't explain it completely, but no match is the same. There are three stages to every match. The building stage, marked by a grace period to build and stuff, the... in-between phase, marked by people dashing around just trying to make enough cash to buy a massive bomb, and the final phase, marked by someone actually managing to coordinate an attack, which ends up decimating the other team and making an insane war-zone of death and chaos.\n\nThe only con I can think of is the very chaos that makes it so original. When you start playing, it is incredibly confusing, and you end up failing a lot. Because of this, this game isn't for everyone, but if you can push past that bit, King Arthur's Gold is truly a gem.","January 31, 2015","true","22.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

So when I saw KAG on steam, I was like "oh boy a game that i liked better go buy it". When it downloaded, I opened it and already ran into a bug; the game's window was bugged. I went to the options panel on the menu, but nothing. Nothing about fullscreen or the resolution, just controls and other nonsense. It took me 5 minutes to find on google that you had to change it BEFORE pressing play on the little window that pops up. Why not just put it in the settings? Is it some sort of limitation on the software used to create the game?\n\nSo, after fixing up my resolution, I decide to play a little bit of sandbox. And god it's horrible. Back in the old time of KAG, it had a simple building layout, with 8 things on it. Simple and easy. Now you have all these wires and lamps and other bullcrap that don't actually need using.  WHAT THE HELL IS WIRE DOING IN A MEDIEVAL GAME, ANYWAY?  I couldn't even select things properly, they just select themself when you scroll over them. This is when I quit. Honestly, I couldn't give two damns about the community, I just want that damn build menu fixed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/219830/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1777 products in account","The premise behind King Arthur's Gold is a good one. A mixture of sandbox, player versus player action, set in a 16-bit medieval pixel world. The result could have been better, but it could also have turned out to be much worse.\n\nFirst off, even though this game has been out for at least two years at the time of this writing, the developers have always been extremely active in patching and updating their creation. With that said, their software is prone to crashing often at the end of matches for whatever reason. Besides that, the game performs well enough. The pixel art is cute and fun to look at, while the sound design also provides a nice experience. All the maps available are by design, and the only variety will come from the role of builders, as they will carve through and add to the already existing landscapes. The team deathmatch mode is the least exciting game type I tried, and I've never gone into a sandbox only server. The most fun I had was playing Capture the Flag mode.\n\nThe main problem with King Arthur's Gold comes from its small player-base. Finding a server to play on has not been a problem in my region, but there are usually no more than four. Most of the player-base seems to be from Europe. Playing matches in a more distant server is doable, but of course, there will be much lag, which will hinder your gameplay experience significantly. The other problem that comes with the small player-base is that most people playing are King Arthur's Gold veterans, likely with 50 or 100 hours or more of experience with the game. This means that for newcomers, being killed quickly and easily will occur quite often. Someone just starting out is no match for the majority of the opposing team. This uneven playing field does not make for a very enjoyable experience. With that said, there are some helpful and friendly players to be found. I asked some questions a few times and at least one person answered me without making a rude or useless remark. In addition, I've noticed that many of the players know each other, and are familiar with one another, as they often post greetings as soon as joining the server. This made for a warm and welcoming environment to be a part of. Being that King Arthur's Gold is a multi-player online game, you should also expect some annoyances to come from immature and rude players in the chat, but it really does not happen that often, from what I've experienced in about twelve and a half hours of playing. If there were more players, and If there was a more even environment in relation to player skill, King Arthur's Gold would be a much more enjoyable experience. It's a shame that a game with so much potential has such a small, but dedicated player-base. It's probably too late for a revival.\n\nKing Arthur's Gold is okay.","March 19, 2015","true","12.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You can't.\n\nMultiplayer is done only via Dedicated Servers~ hosting your own is done by editing a text file with horrible overview in which you have to state virtually all parameters of the hosted game - including the game type. So no "trying a different mode". You have to stop the server, change that text file, start a new server~\n\nFurther - bots don't exist.

This entire game is about knights.\n\nThere are ALOT of bugs in this game, if you hit an arrow sticking out of a block, or the perfect corner of a block, or some random other stops your chara stops moving and you have to jump and keep going- VERY frustrating when it keeps happening and it costs you a flag in CTF.\n\nStuns- I have no idea what stuns a knight, there seems to be no rhyme or reason. He jabs your shield he's not stunned, you jab his you get stunned. Randomly they interupt your slash but you cannot interupt theirs. Shield bashing (landing on their head with your shield) stuns... randomly.\n\nStomping- There seems to be no minimum height to one shot someone by jumping on their heads, some knight jumped over two blocks and landed on my head and "stomped me" ... no idea what this mechanic was intended to do.\n\nSlashing- I slash a knight, he walks right through it 0 damage. He slashes from 8-9 blocks away and teleports through me one shotting me.

It looked like a Terraria-sort of thing, and stuff like that intrigued me. Minecraft and Terraria are those games that make me go "I'll buy it!". I think I'm a creative person, and building games catch my eye. (Apparently, the games I like the most are those with 8-bit and 16-bit graphics systems.)\nIt's not bad, but not good.\n\n\nSGR Score: 6/10 "Bad show.

First of all, King Arthur's Gold dosen't even have actual fullscreen. It gets on my nerves when games with great potential dosen't include a full screen that covers your entire screen. Secondly, it requires a login. I don't understand why some Steam games do this. It really does ruin the fun. Finally, the multiplayer is a bit buggy. My friends and I had some troubles joining each other. I really hope the developers improve upon this game. It really has some great potential.","April 18, 2015","false","5.0"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","4","2","1"
