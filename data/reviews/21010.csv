"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenix_advance/recommended/21010/","phoenix_advance","phoenix_advance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenix_advance/","515 products in account","I bought this game for two simple reasons. I felt like brutally bashing up thugs whilst hearing the cigar-like-cancerous tone of voice that Rorschach has. I got more than I bargained for.\n\nI bought this game as a bundle for $4.74 USD (about $5.41 AUD after conversion). I was a little hesitant because a lot of reviewers have stated that this game is a very repetitive brawler. But to be fair I would say this game is no more repetitive than the brawling action in the critically acclaimed Batman Arkham City.\n\nI don't know why but I really like the atmosphere and main characters in Watchmen. It's like their strength isn't what defines them like Batman or Superman. It's more like they have strong political views on life that makes their characters seem interesting. I wish there were more games based on these types of superheros. Heck, there should be a game based on the Kick-♥♥♥ movies! That would be awesome! To play as Kick-♥♥♥ teaming up with Hit-Girl, or even better Jim Carey’s character … I'd buy that over a 4th Batman Arkham game any day!\n\nThe Kapow game engine used to power Watchmen is quite robust in my opinion. It’s the type of engine where if it was given time to evolve like the Chrome engine, it could potentially turn out to be the next RenderWare engine in terms of popularity/revolutionary. That is to say it’s pretty obvious the engine is quite newly born and I totally commend the developers for that. Because unlike some, for me personally a game engine almost defines all characteristics of a game. There are some funny things that happen like AI characters pushing each other during cinematic sequences, but there are no bugs that will make your gameplay unfair! Hence why I would say robust. I don’t want to pick on Arkham City … but as an example, I remember going into detective mode following footprints that was supposed to lead me to someone … but that someone wasn’t there until I rebooted the game! And I didn’t know I had to reboot the game … because I thought I was stuck on a puzzle I had to figure out!\n\nSome of the things I noticed with the Kapow engine was the brick textures on the walls having something like parallax mapping (which sort of made up for the plain levels). I also noticed that as you walk on different surfaces on the ground it will play the appropriate sound effects, for example walking on a tilled floor vs wood floor then walking on a small area that has glass smashed or walking on a carpet rug. Whilst these technologies aren’t new, they were “noticeable” compared to AAA games.\n\nI want to make some clarifications on the repetitiveness of the game. I agree there is no way I cannot debate against the fact that Watchmen is repetitive. However what I can argue is that from the start till about 60% through the game it’s somewhat a learning experience. You don’t have all moves unlocked. This is done by finding tokens scattered throughout the linear type of maps. But from 60% on till the end I must say I was quite enjoying the game. Something kept me awake and made me want to play. But here’s the funny thing, I started replaying the game with Nite Owl (just to see if I was missing anything) … and I played through the first 2 chapters not even noticing anything repetitive (and only stopped because I had to go out). So I’ve come to the conclusion that there are games like Watchmen that make things obviously repetitive but at least whatever you’re repeating you’re aware and it feels good to do (subjective). And there are some games, like Arkham City where the repetition is subliminal … but whatever you’re repeating is just extremely annoying (also subjective). For me in Arkham City it was completing Riddler’s puzzles scattered all over the map which accounted for 70% of the overall gameplay in my eyes. For anyone to say that wasn’t repetitive … I dunno … you’ve got to check yourself before you wreck yourself!\n\nThere are some reviewers that have also said Watchmen has no story. They must be blind (oh noes here comes the many thumbs down lol), because at the start of each chapter there are wonderful cinematic animation. Sometimes even unique. For instance you get a 1st person view from Nite Owl head butting some dude and the animation zooms in and out with a blurry effect and then you see the dude’s nose bleed. That was pretty cool. Some reviewers claim it as stop-motion animation.\n\nThroughout the game you also hear some lines spoken by Rorschach and Nite Owl. Altogether whilst the story isn’t deeply looked into as opposed to the movie Watchmen, it’s certainly not nothing.\n\nThe fighting mechanics of the game is quite well done. I feel to an extent that it’s geared to the casual gamer. But if you take the time to learn all the moves and time blocks properly, you can end up doing some pretty cool variations. There are a few melee weapons. The most noticeable ones are bat-like objects to which you can swing at your opponent and knock them down (feels good). And then there is the knife which eerily makes your character do moves that are … for lack of a better word hack’n’slash compared to other melee weapons and even the base fighting mechanics.\n\nI think a lot of people are going to call me crazy, but I enjoyed this game much more than Arkham City. I reckon Part 2 should have been DLC and included in the first game. Each game is roughly 3 hours in length. So for 6 hours, there’s no mistake for the price I paid for it. If I had any suggestions for improvement, perhaps make better level designs … they were too basic and not messy enough. But that’s fine, because graphics is not really what makes a good game. Maybe even some props like crates to throw at enemies. I would also suggest for each chapter, add a new variation to common special attacks. The funny thing is this is what was done in the last chapter of Part 2 when beating up the dominatrixes and gimps. The added moves just made me lol … I mean Rorschach punching a woman like a boxing bag … just LOL. I guess he just don’t like them hoes :P But I have this feeling this was probably a deadline and budget problem imposed by Warner Bros. Rating this game against my database is very difficult, it would fall somewhere between 69 and 72 out of 100 … al la … in the vicinity of WrestleMania X8 for Gamecube (which I also quite enjoyed).\n\nNote: You’ll have to forgive me, if things read awkward. I actually began writing this review late November 2013. So it may seem convoluted and incomplete. It’s also a 2 in one review as I don’t consider Watchmen: The End Is Neigh - Part 2 a separate game even though physically it is.","March 12, 2014","true","3.7"," 131 of 146 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","131","146","0","12"

Watchmen (part 1) has a great combat system, good looking graphics and a short story.  I wouldn’t say this game is bad, nor lacking. I’d say it has interesting characters, an attractive plot that lacks closure and a fun combat that some dare say is better than the one you find in the Arkham series.\nCombat is pretty engaging. You have waves of enemies to deal with and combos that feel fluid, that proves how bad ♥♥♥ your character is. The types of enemies are pretty basic. There are the regular thugs, punks who have the spirit but not the training of a fighter and there are the big guys, who actually deal some serious damage if you get hit. At some point you’ll fight with armored trained people. There will be moments when you’ll be surrounded and your health will drop fast, but there are useful combos and there is your partner.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=351883702\nYou can choose between rorschach  and nite owl. Sadly, there is no co op, but you can play in split screens. The differences between them are big enough for you to consider replaying the game for the sake of seeing new moves. It’s not just the level design for your chosen character, but your character way of fighting that would engross you. Rorschach is brutal, violent,  he evades by pirouetting around the enemies. His finishers are merciless, his special ability is to use his rage by running through enemies, knocking them down, he’s a street fighter. Nite Owl is different, he uses some milder fighting techniques, but just as effective. His special ability is to make a flashbang that blinds temporarily those around him(except Rorschach) ; he’s Batman’s little brother.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=315928844\nThe story is pretty intriguing. Rorschach and Nite Owl investigate something on a conspiracy level, but they won’t get to the end of it, the final conclusion they gain is that they’ve been played. Even though it’s called Part 1, the game is standalone, as Part 2 doesn’t continue this game story. Besides, the story is just in the cutscenes, the dialogue in the gameplay puts the emphasis on character development and sometimes it tries to do the same for the world.  The cutscenes are a pretty good break from beating down waves of thugs and it gives meaning to doing it.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=351882138\nOverall, this is a fun game that lasts for 4 hours and considering the low price, it’s something to pick up to spend time in a way you won’t regret it.","December 7, 2014","true","3.4"," 41 of 45 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","41","45","0","3"

You can choose between 2 characters to play each with different combos they can do. If this game is in sale its worth a buy if not then there are better games to play. I still give it thumbs up because even it was short i liked the combo system and also wanted to know how the story progresses.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dizzydown/recommended/21010/","dizzydown","Dizzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dizzydown/","118 products in account","The biggest reason to recommend this title is how satisfying the combat feels. Hits are weighty, meaty, and pack plenty of "oomph". It really feels like you're smashing your fist into someone's face, and the added atmosphere provided by the Watchmen license only helps keep things intersting across the game's relatively short length.\n\nThe combat system is based around a standard light/heavy attack dynamic, but with a few notable nuances. For one, in order to perform combos, you have to time your attacks properly, which in addition to preventing button mashing, creates strategy in deciding which combo is appropriate in which situation. For example, you might really want to use the High Damage combo all the time, but it takes long enough to pull off that you need to be more selective.\n\nNite Owl and Rorschach also have entirely different combos and abilities that play into their characters. Rorschach's abilities are far more aggressive, and he can carry weapons and dodge, while Nite Owl is a bit more technical and defensive, and has a block. They both use the same combat system, but there is just enough difference to properly distinguish them.\n\nRecommended for fans of beat 'em ups and anyone into noir storytelling. If you like punching things, this is probably a safe bet.","June 14, 2015","true","4.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

I do recommend it, conditionally. It has its good points and bad but for the most part it delivers an entertaining few hours of smash and well, more smash.\n\nThe Good:\nThe moves are pretty smooth and easy to pull off.\nThe story fits the mood of the comics/movie well.\nIt's not bad if you get it on sale for 1-3 bucks.\nIt's like a modern Double Dragon or Final Fight.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe graphics are dated. They do the job though, barely.\nNo replayability really.\nRepetitive. You fight. It's a modern Final Fight.\nThe combos are ok but you mainly end up doing the dodge/counteratttack move.\n\nThe Ugly:\nDon't pay full price for it.\nIt's short. I logged the 4.9 hours and I napped in between a couple of levels with the game open, lol.\nThe options are abysmal.\nNeed more playable characters.\nThe gore looks cheesy.\n\nBottom line is this. If you can get it on sale and enjoy a button mashing fight fest with a gritty undertone and slick moves then this game is for you.\n\nJust be aware going in about exactly what it is you are buying here.\nNOTE: If you use an XBOX 360 controller (wireless) be sure to change the setting to use the wired version. Otherwise you get a stuck camera angle and non-responsive controls. The wireless mapping is hosed.\n\nAnyway, just my opinion here but I didn't hate it, didn't love it, got it on sale and don't regret the time spent with it.\n\n\n","November 8, 2014","true","4.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

I mean it. If it's not obvious already, I'm a huge fan of Watchmen, and having a game just adds to all the fun. Unlike normal brawlers, this game has relatively large maps for each chapter, interactive enviroments, immersion, some decent dialogue and is story driven. The combat can start to get a little repetitive, but if you take the time play around with the unique combos, you can scrape out a few extra hours of gameplay. The graphics are actaully rather pretty for a 2009 game and feels like i'm in the comic universe. The enemies don't really differ in terms of dialogue, fighting style, or basic class, though their designs fit each chapter rather nicely. If you ever have some spare cash lying around and would like 4-6  hours of comical/mature entertainment then I highly suggest you give this game a shot.","June 29, 2015","true","5.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chrisizeful/recommended/21010/","chrisizeful","chrisizeful","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chrisizeful/","1137 products in account","Summary:Watchmen: The End is Nigh is an extremely linear, shallow beat-em up with a horrible story. The only good things about it are the decent fighting mechanics that offer a lot of different moves, the decent graphics and animations, and the great cutscenes that include comic book style graphics and voice acting. The short, six-level story revolves around one character named Underboss. There is one boss fight, with Underboss, that is incredibly boring and buggy. Other than that fight, you are stuck fighting waves of the same groups of enemies throughout the levels over and over again for the entire the game.\nThe Good:       The fighting mechanics. The combat mechanics are subpar, but at the same time not completely awful. Each of the two playable characters have several generic fight moves, special moves and finishers. Also, one of the characters (Rorschach) can pickup and attack with several different melee weapons. The moves and abilities are unlockables and are found / unlocked as you progress through the game. You can also dodge enemy attacks.\nAwesome cutscenes. The cutscenes are in a comic book style and look amazing. There is also voice acting for every character in the cutscenes which sound great.\nGood graphics. The graphics are good for when it came it out and they are also still pretty good now. The animations are also very nice.The Bad:       Literally the same exact same thing over and over. The entire game is fighting groups of enemies. As you progress through the levels basically all you do is encounter new groups one at a time.\nTwo types of enemies. Excluding Underboss, there only two types of enemies. The normal enemy, and the heavy enemy (who has more health and is stronger than the norml one).\nReaccurng, boring tasks. There are four 'tasks' to do: open doors, climb ladders, grapple (Night Owl) and climb poles (Rorschach). These are put into the levels a lot and are insanely boring.\nLinear levels. There is only ever one path to take  in the levels. There are occasionally seperate paths for Night Owl and Rorschach, but that's it.\nFew levels. There are only six levels, and they're fairly short.\nHorrible story. The entire story surrounds one character named Underboss, Also, there are very, very few characters in the whole story. I don't want to spoil anything too much, so I'll just leave it at I think the story sucks.\nThe ♥♥♥♥♥iest character names. The name of the main enemy is Underboss. Another enemy is named Jimmy the Gimmick. Seriously...\nOne boss fight.  The only boss fight is the one with Underboss. The fight is boring as hell and also quite bugging. When I played it he stopped twice for no reason and just stood there, and I couldn't damage him.\n","December 30, 2015","false","3.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","7","9","2","0"

The story is simple. A prison break happens and a villain by the name of Underboss escapes and it's up to you to catch him and bring him to justice.\n\nGameplay is very simple beat em up style, you go through levels and beat up thugs. There is a mini game where you pick locks but it's really bad. Each character has his own special ability as well. Nite Owl has a taser suit which when charged up can inflict more damage on enemies if they touch you. Rorschach has a rage meter, when it gets full you do twice the damage and counter every attack without a press of a button. The fighting mechanics in this game are abysmal. The game get's boring very fast and nothing really changes pace cause every level is the same.\n\nThe game looks mediocre at best, the textures are low resolution, the character models are awful, not to mention they are reused almost every level. The comic style cut scenes are very well done and probably the only good thing about this game.\n\nAudio in this game is horrible. The soundtrack is bad. There were many times when the audio would cut out and only come back minutes later. Overall the audio design isn't impressive at all.\n\nThe game is overall pretty easy until the final boss battle where there is a massive difficulty spike, where the final boss can kill you in just a few hits and then it's back at the start. But after a few tries you get down what you're supposed to do and it's smooth sailing.\n\nLevel design is straight forward. The level is a straight road and you follow it till the end. When you play as different characters you can access the different parts of the map cause sometimes you need to split up.\n\nThe game is very short, it took me 3,5 hours to finish it. The game has a bit of replayability if you want to play it again after the first time. You can play as different characters and try to collect the collectibles which upgrade your health and special ability.\n\nThe game doesn't have many glitches or stuff like that. The only problem is the very stupid AI partner the game gives you. Sometimes you need the partner to open certain doors and it takes forever for him to actually get to you cause sometimes he doesn't follow you into battle.\n\nOverall Watchmen: The End is Nigh is a bad adaptation of the movie and the novel. The game get's boring really fast. Get the game only if you're only a massive and I mean a massive fan of Watchmen or get this game on sale cause it's not worth it at full price. I give Watchmen: The End is Nigh a 3/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","July 3, 2015","false","2.8"," 20 of 34 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","20","34","2","0"

Enemies are basic not giving much challenge and are very limited in models with many of the same character often filling the screen and little over a half dozen models.\n\nFor fans of the series we get another cop-out.

It's short, the story is really lame, it can hardly be considered a pre-quel to the movie/comics since there's no connection whatsoever to the original events.\nThe gameplay is simple, but it suffers from the camera problem of old games (you can get attacked from people that arent showing up on the screen and you dont get warned about it). Few combos, but the executions are really sweet.\nAnd the graphics are nice.\nBut the biggest problem is: it is VERY REPETITIVE. Its like: fight, open door, fight, open door, fight.\nIf you played Ghostrider for PS2, its exactly the same thing.\nThe characters have some philosofical discussions through  the game, but its hardly any deep like the comics intended them to be.

Beating up bad guys is extremely fun... and there is enough move variety to keep it interesting.  Nite Owl's fighting style is different enough to warrant a playthrough as each character.

When standing still, you can rotate, while running it has like a 50/50 chance to work or not to work. It's like the controls are totally randomized out of the inputs you give. Sometimes even attacking doesn't work and you hear some error-like sounds.\nPlus the game is bugged as ♥♥♥♥. When charging enemies it happened a few times, that I just popped out of the scenery and someow fell like 2km away down into nothingness. The bugs don't make it unplayable, but when you spend 5 minutes on a boss, and right before finishing him you pop into nowhere, thats ♥♥♥♥ing annoying!\n\nIf you wanna play some beat em up for little money, go get prince of persia or anything else, just not this game.","September 19, 2014","false","2.9"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

It is however a very beautiful such. Its true to the Zack Snyder movie adaptation and you can see Rorschach's brutal but precise fighting style, or you can play as Nite owl, who utilizes a more smoothe and round-reaching way of taking down criminals, cops and those in between. It will get pretty repetative after a while since the level design is fairly mirrored and there really is just two kinds of foes. Normal foot soldiers and big brawlers. It does however have nice comic book-styled cutscenes, and i would say it's one of the more story-driven game's, as opposed to actual gameplay. the mystery storyline is compelling and fun to try to figure out. If you like watchmen, either the original graphic novel or the movie adaptation, and have a friend in handy, It's a game worth picking up. However, if you are a lonely troll, then just don't dowload this game, leave your computer and get out and try to meet people. Because after all, there are few things as fun as to hunt down criminals (and other people who stands in your way) with a friend.","February 14, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The whole thing is just bloody awful, the graphics are ugly, the levels are boring and repetitive, you fight pretty much the same guy cloned a thousand times, because all enemies look the same. Talking of the fights: The whole game is always and constant the same dull repetition: Run along some corridor, beat down some dudes through the same stupid, repetitive, boring combat system, continue to run, split up, run, fight, meet Rorschach/Night Owl again, run, fight, get bored as hell.\nThe story is a joke. A simple, stupid, bad joke made from cynical WarnerBros. Which obviously only tried to make a fast buck out of the Watchmen franchise.

If anything I was a little let down on the actual "play area". the forced alley-style level maps leave little for fighting space, and kinda make me dizzy with the camera constantly flipping around. 7/10","October 26, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is just too bad. I gave it a try again after some weeks, realised, who awful this ♥♥♥♥ is, and abandoned it until the end is nigh for me.\n\nThat said, just let me add, that “Watchmen: The end is nigh” is pretty much one of the most stupid things on steam. The whole thing is just bloody awful, the graphics are ugly, the levels are boring and repetitive, you fight pretty much the same guy cloned a thousand times, because all enemies look the same. Talking of the fights: The whole game is always and constant the same dull repetition: Run along some corridor, beat down some dudes through the same stupid, repetitive, boring combat system, continue to run, split up, run, fight, meet Rorschach/Night Owl again, run, fight, get bored as hell.\nThe story is a joke. A simple, stupid, bad joke made from cynical WarnerBros. Which obviously only tried to make a fast buck out of the Watchmen franchise. This stupid, dull rubbish is NOT at all worth the name “Watchmen”. There is no deep story (until the point, where I finally gave up), pretty much all appearance of characters you know are nothing else then unmotivated, senseless fan service at most. Nothing of this pathetic piece of digital ♥♥♥♥ is in any way worth the name “Watchmen”.\n\n♥♥♥♥ this game.
