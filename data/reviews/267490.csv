If you're looking for a good platformer, hold off on it. For now. Batman‚Ñ¢: Arkham Origins Blackgate adds a good story upon Arkham Origins' original one that will keep any Batman-fan interrested to the end. However, in terms of gameplay, it's not too good. Not for a Batman game nor a platformer.\n\nThe Good:\n¬∑ An interresting story that takes place after Arkham Origins and before Arkham Asylum, set mostly in Blackgate Prison.\n¬∑ Fun and different take on the Arkham storyline. With drawn comicbook-esque cinematics and 2.5D gameplay it offers an entirely different way of playing as Batman. Using Batman's gadgets in 2D is surprisingly entertaining.\n¬∑ Collectibles give fans a reason to return to the game after completion, albeit very linear. That being said...\n\nThe Bad:\n¬∑ ... the game plays a bit too linear for an Arkham game. The combat and platforming feel a bit too stiff and at points even forced. The series is known for, among others, its Free Flow combat system. Don't expect to see Free Flow combat here. There is combat in the game that looks a little bit like the combat in Arkham Asylum, but it plays stiff and clunky.\n¬∑ Confusing and overly-guided platforming combined with reasonably frustrating stealth gameplay will definately take some getting used to (for example, Batman will switch from one platform in the foreground to another platform in the background using the Batclaw and there is no option to look around while in vents).\n\nThe Ugly:\n¬∑ For a port its pretty reasonable, with smoothened egdes and overall a slightly better quality but characters will still feel stiff and the environments at times a bit repetetive or downright boring.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nBatman‚Ñ¢: Arkham Origins Blackgate is a fun game to play through if you're a big Batman fan, but platformer-lovers won't really find anything new or surprisingly interresting. Are you interrested in the game for its story, or are you looking for the series' innovative gameplay? That question is one this review answers.\n7/10.\n","April 1, 2014","true","4.2"," 268 of 318 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","268","318","0","9"

I am begging you, do not buy this game. It's closer to a foreign knock-off of an actual Arkham game. There are elements, sure, like Detective Vision, but the game becomes a clunky sidescroller, and I do mean clunky. I played for ten horrible minutes, and I truly believe that I would have felt more in control if the game was entirely controlled by button prompts, like DDR. Maybe you're an Arkham fan, and like me, you see this game on sale for $5. Maybe you ignore the negative reviews and decide to buy it, like me. Save your money, PLEASE. If this game is on sale, odds are other games are too, and here on Steam, $5 can go a long way.

Having received incredibly tepid reviews when debuting on the handheld one can only imagine that the game hardly sold a dozen on the Vita which is probably why Warner Bros. commissioned a port onto every known conceivable device to man in order to probably recuperate costs. Not that they should have bothered to be honest since Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate can't quite make up its mind whether it wants to be a metroidvania sidescroller or 2.5D version of its 3D cousins and somewhere along the line fails miserably at being either.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=471612559\nNow that Batman is a bona-fide video game star it was only a matter of time before publishing house Warner Bros. was going to slip up and unfortunately Blackgate does nothing to erase the mediocrity that was birthed throughout the entire Origins saga (the original console and PC release of Origins was plagued by a host of issues, was the lowest rated Batman game for the franchise and still to this day remains the least favorite amongst fans). I don't believe all the fault lies with Armature Studios - who developed Blackgate - since they probably had a vision for the game but trying to tie it so closely to its 3D brothers ends up doing the game no favors. I can only imagine that this was the idea of some suit at central headquarters.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=471772661\nBatman: Arkham Origins Blackgate's story unfolds through the use of some budget comic book sequences that appear to be in place thanks to the limitations of the original system and don't really help dispel the notion that the game was probably more of an afterthought to further milk fans of some of their hard-earned dosh. Once again escaped convicts are running amok in Arkham's most famous penitentiary and it's up to the world greatest detective to put things right. While Armature studios have opted to retain as much of the combat mechanics from the core franchise as possible, the problem is that they just don't transition very well into the 2.5D space and feel sluggish and cumbersome and nowhere near as fluid as what can be found in the core series. Stealth also comes off second best in this iteration and is often too unpredictable, not to mention broken, to be of any worth to the actual gameplay. It ends up being more of a hindrance that only further hobbles this ill-conceived project. Blackgate also involves a lot of backtracking and possibly comes with one of the most confounding and useless maps I have ever seen in a game. Just opening up the map each time to see where I was and what my objective in the game was gave me a constant headache. There is also very little reward to exploring these corridors of Blackgate as each area feels endlessly familiar. Even though the game is not a long one and can be completed in just over 6 hrs, one can't shake that nagging feeling that even at 6 hrs the game feels about 4 hrs too long.\n\nAt the end of the day Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate is nothing more than a cheap knock-off and you would be better off putting your money elsewhere or just grabbing the core franchise and bypassing this dud entirely.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","July 21, 2015","false","6.1"," 194 of 247 people (79%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","79","194","247","17","13"

These are to be expected however due to the limited specs of the platforms the game was originally made for.\n- The whole unique selling point of it being a 2.5D game just doesn't work well. Arkham Asylum may have seemed linear at times but at least there was some open space to move, this game is all in enclosed corridors and isn't even interesting to look at.\n\nOverall, I can only recommend this if you are a huge fan of the series, and at a deep discount.

I looked at some reviews and there a mix of good and bad. Alot of people said that the combat was bad, detective mode and visuals were horrible. As an arkham fan, playing arkham asylym first and enjoying it very so, I decided to give blackgate a chance and see for myself how it was after beating arkham origins.\n\nSo the game takes place three monthes after Batman Arkham Origins.The basic story is you got a blackgate prison out break, and Batman is trying to stop this outbreak by gaining control of the 3 blocks the prison is divided in by bringing back power to each block. Each block is controlled by a villian. Arkham Wing - Penguin, Administration Building - The Joker, and Industrial Building - Black Mask. Note there is also Soloman Grundy, Deadshot and Catwoman in the game, and you interact with them along the way. The game offers a bit of a choice as you can kind of go after The Joker, Penguin or Black Mask in any order.This does give a new way an arkham game could work, as in all the other arkham games the order in which you chase your villians changes as the story goes on. (Side quests don't count.) There are side quests you can do in this game, but it feels a big task in doing them, and not very fun like in the other arkham games.\n\nSo let me tell you some things about the combat. Me personally, I didn't find the combat bad, at times I did like it. However, it could use quite a bit of work. First of all, it is a 2.5D game, as in its a 2D Sidescroller game where you can only move left and right, but you're moving around in a 3D World. This already gives you a sense of why people are not liking the combat. The combat in the other arkham games were more free flow and fast paced, where as in arkham blackgate, its restricting, annoying and slow. By restricting I mean you can only fight enemies who are close to you, and fighting off other enemies requires you to jump over the one closest to you, and make your way more up with enemies farther.\n\nThe controls aren't good as they're are unresponsive and kind of dumb. Prefferably its better to play with a control for this game as the controls are better. It almost pains me to play the game as it more feels like a task. The map itself is very annoying as you can get lost so many times and you're basically spending hours just trying to get to your main point. The map you get to navigate your way around blackgate is confusing as it tries to put a 3D like map in flat like form. On top of that, you need to find upgrades in this map which can also be a pain, as in if you don't the boss battles can be unbeatable.\n\nSo far for the boss battles, Penguin being the hardest as in one of his guards spot you, they litterly shoot you to death which takes about 2 seconds resulting in you dieing in the process. Not only is that hard, but its even harder as you're in a small area, and to get the guards away from penguin you have to give distractions, and they see you constantly. On top of that, there are drones that scout out the area and shoot on sight which results in a automatic death.\n\nThe Catwoman boss battle was a bit challenging as you have to time your countering and attacks 100% accuatley and perfectly. Gettingn hit twice results in a automatic death, and there isn't a checkpoint or anything in the battle as its constant dodging every second for like two minutes. It may not seem that hard, but once you get there I wouldn't be surpirsed if you saw some people did it on youtube.\n\nNow keep in my mind, this game was originally designed to be on a 3DS/PS Vita. Armature Studies gave a port to give the arkham fans an original feel as all arkham games are for the console (originally made by rocksteady). However, if a game is deisgned for the 3DS/PS Vita, that same game shouldn't have the same design on console/pc versions. if you do, you get all of what I said before, annoying combat, bad maps, annoying controls, it works but is almost unenjoyable, and it's task to play.\n\nI don't want to reccomend or not reccomend the game. As an arkham fan the story was decent. Nothing special. Explains a little of what happened between Batman Origins and arkham asylum. So, I will say this. Get this game when its on sale, as its worth the price of 5 bucks. The game itself isn't worth the 20, and I thought this as soon as I actually got into the game.\n\nWhat I suggest Rocksteady to do is make a game that is actually, a sequel to Arkham Origins after they conclude the arkham series with Arkham knight. This game was supposed to be designed to be like that, hence, why it has the name "origins" in the title. However, i think its honnestly a bad idea to do this and design the game itself to be on hand-held consoles, and then to be later ported on to regualr consoles. In my opnion, its a bad idea.\n\nLets hope rocksteady can correct this mistake and give us a real arkham game like blackgate, but redesigned for consoles.\n\nOverall, the game deserves a\n\n7/10","October 5, 2014","false","10.2"," 68 of 96 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","68","96","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/san1281/recommended/267490/","san1281","sanitarian1281","http://steamcommunity.com/id/san1281/","1229 products in account","I finished up Arkham Origins and lucked into a really cheap copy of AO: Blackgate at roughly the same time. Blackgate is a 2.5D side-scrolling beat-'em-up with a few puzzles thrown in. The story is told through motion-comic-style cutscenes with full voice-acting and it revolves around riots that take place at Blackgate sometime apparently not long after the events of Origins. Black Mask, Penguin, and Joker have all taken control of a section of the prison and Batman has to go in and rescue hostages and take down the bad guys in his inimitable Batman way.\n\nSadly, the gameplay itself is sorely lacking. Armature Studios made an effort to translate the Arkham series' signature free-flow combat to a 2.5D game but it doesn't quite work. As you see from the image below, the game is fond of tossing upwards of 5-8 opponents at Batman simultaneously; this level of opposition is non-problematic in the regular Arkham games because Batman is free to move around at will and target any of his opponents at any time. Here, the Darkknight Detective's movements are restricted to left and right and the game determines his target based on which enemy happens to be closest and in the direction he's currently facing. This makes tactically targeting specific enemies needlessly difficult, especially when facing knife- or stun-baton-wielding foes, which require certain actions to eliminate. In small groups the regular villains aren't too difficult to handle, but when the game presents you with multiple groups of antagonists at once, things can get hairy.\n\nHowever, the boss fights are the epitome of everything that you hate about the concept of "boss fight" in a game. Some of them, like Black Mask and Bronze Tiger, are pretty straightforward, but the Penguin, Joker, and Catwoman battles get progressively more irritating as you fight through multiple stages that require very specific attack strategies to defeat. I actually quit the game before finishing the Catwoman fight because for some absurd reason the counters don't work the same way in this conflict as they do in the rest of the game; the second and third stages of this fight require you to counter her attacks before you can go on the offensive, and because the controls for countering appear to be virtually unresponsive in this fight, I gave up after 9-10 attempts. Maybe if you're more dexterous than me, you'll have better luck.\n\nThe other aspects of the game are merely okay. The game includes a detective mode, like its big brothers, so Batman can scan the environment for ways to get around and collectibles. There are suit pieces that can be collected and different Batsuits can confer bonuses. For example, the "Beware the Batman" suit that you get by having an Arkham Origins save on your computer provides a 50% armor bonus against gunfire. A Blackest Night suit (grants invulnerability to most forms of damage) is available by collecting the pieces in-game (you'll have to get about 95% of the way through the game to get all of the pieces so it's not game-breaking) and another (Zero Year) that you get from having a WBID login. You can only collect one of the other suits per playthrough, depending on the order in which you defeat the game's bosses. There are also detective cases to solve, which essentially involves going everywhere it's possible to go and scanning all areas with your Detective Vision until you find all of the clues associated with a specific case (these just basically provide a minimal amount of additional insight into the villains' activities just before or during the events of the game). You'll spend a lot of time doing Armature's version of the crypto-sequencer, which means matching a sequence of three numbers until you get the correct combination to unlock a door or device.\n\nYou won't be able to get every collectible in each area the first time you go through it because, as in the other Arkham games, some require you to have access to gadgets that you have to acquire as you progress through the story. That's not so unusual, but navigating through the different areas of the prison using the in-game map is quite a chore because it often appears that you can head in a particular direction, only to come across a dead end or switchback and the maps are really just cleverly-constructed labyrinths. At least a few hours of my playtime I can probably chalk up to wandering around the cell blocks and industrial areas, trying to reach an exit or some other specific landmark that was gratuitously problematic to locate.\n\nEverything looks good here and the voice-acting is first-rate, so there are no issues on the presentation side, but in the final analysis, this game is remarkably inferior to its full-fledged, 3D brethren. The action is mediocre, the puzzles aren't really puzzles at all, the boss fights are infuriating, and the story is really the only interesting thing about it. I spent about 19 hours playing but if you're the kind of OCD person who needs to get every achievement, you'll have to play three times so you could easily get the same amount of mileage out of this as you did from Arkham Origins. By then you'll probably wish you'd never heard of Batman, let alone this particular game.\n","May 14, 2014","false","19.4"," 49 of 69 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","49","69","0","0"

The 2.5D nature makes it really hard to tell what you can and can't interact with, given that you'll be going in and out of the background in various rooms, and the combat system being a stripped down, less-controllable version of the Arkham games' fighting means that enemy encounters are a slog rather than an easily skipped or shot target when traversing older rooms. The enemies can be in three dimensions, but you cannot move in them, so if someone is not quite in the melee yet, or is pushed aside somehow, well, enjoy dropping combos as you want to hit them. (Similarly, it makes targeting whoever has the assault rifle a real bear, because guess what the lock-on doesn't prioritize in this game like the others?)\n\nAnother thing that should be mentioned is that while they try really, really hard to make sure the controls keep continuity with the other games, this is adapted from a 3DS/Vita game, which means that some very, very strange controls are in place, and let's not even get into how Detective Mode is basically just "see vision cones because where enemies are looking is not always clear". To actually look at things, you need to turn on DM, then hold the button down to bring up a magnifying-glass reticle, then shift it with one stick while hoping anything at all on your screen is something Batman will interact with. These objects are, by and large, not highlighted (or sometimes even hinted at in any fashion), so just pull out the ol' magnifier whenever you hit a dead end and hope that's the right response, not "oops I needed to look at a grate two rooms back so I could open it".\n\nLet me be fair to the game and give it some honest praise: it seems to be somewhat non-linear. There are three seperate wings of the prison you need to get into, and each is its own distinct area with a gadget that'll help you progress/an upgrade to pass more security clearance, which will also open up new secrets in the others, so that's cool. It's just that the actual traversal and exploration is a massive pain due to the environments being unclear in what's set dressing and what's interactable, and the combat being a large slog for back-and-forth travel. (It doesn't even give you XP or anything like in the other Arkham titles, so it is seriously just time-wasting filler. Your health regenerates slowly out of combat.)\n\nI seriously can't recommend this game to anyone unless you really, really want to see Batman do the Samus thing, or finally want an Arkham game that lets you play dress-up without needing to NG+ it. It's not particularly fun and so, so many games on Steam scratch the gameplay itch for this genre better.","March 22, 2015","false","4.3"," 40 of 56 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","40","56","0","0"

(but dont do like a lot of people do and rage quit as all the enemies in game are beatable.....................i am looking at you MR COBBLEPOT!!!!!!)\n\nFinally defeated you PENGUIN!!

It is noticeably different in terms of gameplay and the playrs perspective when playing. This biggest difference to other games that this has, is definetely the Side-Scrolling Style. It is a 2.5 Dimensional Experience (Wrap your head around that!)\nThe main reasons for the change are:\n-Armature Studios (Known for Metroid) created the bulk of content here.\n-WB Games wanted to include Ps Vita Users and even 3DS users in the Arkham series, since Batman was growing in popularity! (Everybody loves Batman right?) So this style was more handheld friendly.\n-An experient really, to see how well it would work in that sort of environment.\nNow Because it is so apart from the other game, it recieved bad reviews for PC. As a PS Vita game it is immpressive, but as a PC Game...\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=582629249\n\nBecause of the style that the Arkham games have used so well(Open world, free-flow combat, third person, etc.), this game obviousy had to bring lots to the table to make up for the lacking features of the regulars. But does it deliver? thats the Big question, lets see if i can give it justice where its needed. Here is the Pros and Cons:\n\nPROS:+Interesting side scrolling variant! the introduction of new environments and camera angles that the average third person view wont cut. There are parts where it definetely shows its potential.\n+The Progression (Suit armour, Waynetech Upgrades and Combat Unlockables) is done carefully like the other games, but it seems more noticeable than the other games. The Natural Progression that youl find is the best kind there is.\n+The Detective mode is very unique and definetely reminds everyone that this was designed for a handheld gaming device.(Swipe finger to use and all that.), but it does shine a new light on detective skills and finding well hidden clues.\n+Because it is 2.5D, the Combat is simplified quite a bit, hihgh combos will be much easier to achieve. This is one of the many parts that gets Simplified. (Other examples include: Stealth sequences, hiding areas, Gadget use and the Detective scanner.) -However, Many people who liked the origal combat system will dislike this.\n+The Plot is good and the map is heavily influenced by the ongoing story. There are 3 main sections to play in. (These include The Cells blocks, Administration and Industrial.)The best part about these seperate locations is that each one has been captured by 3 of Batman's Biggest villains...Black Mask, Joker and Penguin. This works very well with the story and the feeling of liberating each one is great! Although it isn't as large and "free" as the other games.\n+First Appearance of Catwoman in the Arkham Storyline. Amd many new characters are introduced\n+The Cutscene illustration is amazing! Its like watching a cartoon or a slideshow in the Batman universe. Its very unique when compared to the other games and its Art-style is a welcome addition to the series. They do seem a bit lazy in parts and switch pictures rather than a fluid scene. This wasnt a big issue for me however.\n+The Boss battles are mostly great and provide a respectful difficulty spike in various environements. Guards everywhere with flamethrowers equip Vs gargoyle-hopping stealth sections are a great mix!\n+Many Unlockable suits and upgrades provided some reasons for replayability, you wont get everything all your first playthrough either. Lots of cool suits however so i felt that it was worth it at least.\n+The Length of 6-8 hours seems normal and proportional for a title of its style and content.\n+Serves as an expansion into the world of the Arkham Games, not much else. But it is very interesting because it does take place in Blackgate Penitentiary  (The Main Prison before Arkham Asylum.) which is an entirely new location. So at least there is competely new areas to explore.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=582629424\nCONS:-Recylces lots of content from previous games\n-Story is interesting at many parts, but the execution of the concepts appear Too Linear and Dull far more than enough. The Cutscenes do a good job with introductions to characters, important fight scenes and Montages...but thats about it! No long term events, no cliff hangers, hardly anything to lead into the future. The Major build ups to Boss battles or other important sections feel too slow and often include LOTS of backtracking, Especially at the start and even middle of the game. Backtracking is ok, but generally its better if the reason is very justified and well explained. Why get something on the other side of the map, when you can call the Batwing?\n-Stealth is suuuper limited for this kind of game, which is a big shame. Because Batman is meant to be an All-Rounder Hero with many different approaches to dangerous situations!\n-Because this game was intended for the PS Vita, it has various technical features that are either dumbed down or removed entirely to make it "fit" properly.\n-Something minor really but, Collectible placement is the dumbest thing ever! Why is there Waynetech Crates with Armour upgrades within the cells of Blackgate? Is Bruce trying to recover them all from the Incredibly sly criminals who took them? I'll never know...\n-So many Boring environments that feel dull and repeated. At least each of the 3 locations has something new to show. Otherwise they wouldnt have a very effective name at all.\n-Controls are clunky at the best of times and due to the changing camera angles (When you turn corners, or falll down a hole.) you have to expect quick movement control swaps or little things like that.\n-Graphics are the worst of the series, but this just relates back to the fact that it wasnt intended for PC or console.\n-Voice Acting is Mainly Sub-Standard, but some characters are done well because they have amazing Voice Actors! (Penguin, Joker and Catwoman sound the best.) This is important for the plot, but doesnt make a huuuge difference. Except when an important Person is talking and you need to work with them/save them! (Giving these kinds of NPC's a few lines for a big chunk of gameplay is strange!)\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=593382815\nFinal Thoughts:Well, its no masterpiece, far from it in fact. But people should definetely view this game for the way it was intended and presented. Not a solid Block of story to continue on from Origins. Instead I like to see it as a "test" for the PS Vita to see if The Arkham Series can be introduced to it. And my answer to that "Test" is a big YES! Although the PC Port is another story!\nBrief:\nIf you like Side scrollers and Action Games, this is for you.\nIf you have been playing much of the arkham series casually and are unsure to get this one, you can take a miss for sure.\nIf you like Batman and want to see the unique art-style that this game has to offer, this is definetely for you.\nIf you are tired of reading this review, dont worry its almost the endOverall I rate this game an Average score of 6.5/10\nNot the best adaptation for Batman, and definetely not one that he needed either. But it exists and it has many good points in the story. Not sure about the continuation though.\n\nLeave a comment below with anything i missed, or any questions. Now if you'll excuse me, im going to play the game all over again to play the other 2 endings...(Like that'll ever happen)\n-Kyle","May 17","false","54.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Its hard to reccomend, I am a Batman nut so if it's a solid game I'll thumbs up anything.  To a casual you probably wont find much to light - its on the light side, the puzzles and metroidvania elements are pretty basic and the combat can get very frustrating sometimes especially when you got 2-3 specials on the screen that need specific tactics to deal with.  In traditional Batman Arkham games this wouldnt be an issue as its 3D - however being this is 2/2.5D it becomes a huge clutter at times trying to deal with multiple enemy types.  A personal nitpick is that I was able to unlock a new suit before the end of the game, whcih also goes into New-Game+, that makes you invincible...kind of a game breaker.\n\nMore on the story - it's pretty bare bone.  You are sent to Blackgate to rescue hostages, but there is no dialogue, no interaction with anyone really aside from the brief boss fights or conversation with Catwoman.  To spoil a little even the motivations you find are pretty irrelevant, at the end you dont even know why the villian was doing what they were doing - if anything other than a paycheck.  The three hub villians are really in it for screen time and to cause chaos.  Its just an excuse to throw Batman into 3 hubworlds against typical thugs.  I semi compared it to Indiana Jones' contribution to Raiders of the Lost Ark, courtesy of the Big Bang Theory.  I left the game feeling the story did nothing to me, unaccomplished and quite possibly if I, or Batman, were not apart of it, the same result would have occured or nothing at all.\n\nIf I had to rate the game it would be a 3/5 - its above average, 20 dollars might be a little steep for what you're getting in the end especially with the actual content the game provides though.  Bought it on sale for 5 dollars, 1 playthrough got me 8.5 hours.  21/30 achievements.  I personally dont have an interest to revist the game again - at least not for awhile.  It does quite literally nothing to advance the plot of Arkham Origins, or anything specific to Batman.  There is an interesting ultra sidestory of Amanda Waller and the Suicide Squad that anyone who watches Batman or DC Comics can call the second its on camera.","September 23, 2014","true","8.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/267490/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Batman Arkham Origins Blackgate is an interesting Batman game. It does things a bit different than the newer Batman games. If I had to make a comparison Arkham Asylum would be closest as far as the gameplay is concerned, because this one also plays like a Metroidvania game, except that you play it on a 2.5D pane this time. So the camera will shift to other angles depending on your location. And because of this the controls aren't as tight as they could be. Remember the older Resident Evil games with their stiff movements ? Sometimes you have to move a certain way but have no clue how to move your analog stick; the game doesn't recognize the obvious, natural move you'd normally make and therefore you unintentionally go back and forth sometimes. Infuriating and frustrating.\n\nAnother thing that also bothered me, in this day and age, was the lack of lip syncing. I can't think of many other games that don't have this feature nowadays. I know it's supposed to be some sort of budget Batman game, but come on, they could've easily used the models from the other games and downgraded them. Sloppy.\n\nThe game itself is, praise the Lord, pretty good. It works like any other Metroidvania game. I've told you a dozen times about what a Metroidvania game is all about so I hope you remembered it or else look it up somewhere.\n\nThe 'detective mode' is a feature that was pretty cool, because you have to scan the environments for clues. Find enough of these clues and you'll solve the case. These clues aren't shown on your map so you have to basically scan everything you see. It would've been nice if you could scan on the move instead of having to stand still but that's just me nitpicking I guess.\n\nThe boss fights are also nice; some of them are easy, other ones are a bit more difficult.\nBecause the game uses several maps instead of one big map like many other Metroidvania games navigation is sometimes hard. Near the end of the game you have to move between all 4 maps regularly and one mission in particular makes you backtrack through several of these environments. The downside is that you can't easily teleport. It wouldn't fit the game, I agree, but surely they could've come up with something. You can only leave a map at the beginning and at the end, and there's no way in between. The map is hard to read so you'll probably get lost every now and then. The fact that you can move into several directions doesn't help either. Unnecessary if you ask me.\n\nThe game is lengthy, and will take you about 7-12 hours, depending on what you what to collect. That's just right for a game like this.\n\nThe graphics haven't been upgraded because the characters still have blurry textures. But it still looks nice in motion. Just don't expect the graphics from the previous Batman games.\n\nBatman Arkham Origins Blackgate is a fun game, but unfortunately not without its flaws. And despite these flaws it definitely deserves a chance.\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","April 3, 2014","true","8.7"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

Among those collectables are cool new Batsuits but unlike others in the Arkham series where it‚Äôs just for show some of these suits actually give you a boost to help you out during the course of the campaign. I recommend hunting down ‚ÄúThe Darkest Knight‚Äù suit as it basically gives you invulnerability. I also loved the comicbook-esque cinematics‚Ä¶ It might not be for everyone but for me it reminded me of watching the original animated series way back in the day.\n\nUnfortunately, as much as I enjoyed playing the game and taking in it‚Äôs cool narrative from a unique perspective it was annoyingly frustrating at times due to its finicky controls. Example, when fighting one or more enemies close together and you use cap stun it won‚Äôt affect both as in previous titles. Instead you have a 50/50, or even lower chance with more than two, of stunning the intended enemies; which is very problematic when fighting armored knife wielders. Speaking of armaments, the gadgets aren‚Äôt exactly all that interesting or innovative‚Ä¶ unless you count the slight improvement to the Explosive Gel which can now actually be shot over short distances. The gadgets are not the only thing on the boring side but the level design is also nothing to write home about. They are repetitive and downright boring.\n\nUltimately, Batman: Arkham Origins ‚Äì Blackgate is a fun game to play through once or twice but I‚Äôd only recommend it for the hardcore fans or those who absolutely love platformers. At the very least I would suggest only picking this title up during one of the many Steam sales for $5.00 because it‚Äôs just not worth $19.99, especially when you can grab one of the core Arkham titles for that price instead.\n\n-SPARTAN 117 B01","March 25","true","15.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The only drawback to this game is the combat, it doesnt feel as strong as the 'father' games of the series, a bit clunky and unresponsive to commands, i mentioned it in the above video this being the only weak point of my first 20 minutes and it did continue on sadly.

Originally a handheld title for the 3DS and Vita, the game was later ported to home consoles and the PC probably because they realized nobody cared about this game. I think nobody still cares, but let's move on.\n\nThe plot is pretty inconsequential just like Arkham Origins. It's not like there can be any tension to the story as you know what's going to happen because of earlier games. The inmates managed to take over Blackgate prison and some hostages to turn the place into a madhouse. Three factions divided the area, that's Joker, Penguin and Black Mask and even though they're supposedly rival gangs you won't see them interact anytime soon. Unfortunately for Batman you need something from each part of the prison to get those hostages to safety. You also might encounter random B-list villains who are there for their boss fight even though they have no reason to be there. Then there's also Catwoman who Batman caught two weeks before the incident and now mysteriously helps you with no ulterior motive at all. Oh and finally there's some hinting at a Suicide Squad thing, but as of this review it's 2016 and we have no word on anything about that.\n\nThis game is tedious as all hell. It's structured like a Metroidvania, but it's done so poorly you start wondering if any of the staff even played Super Metroid or Symphone of the Night. Traversing through this horribly-designed areas makes me long for death. What's wrong with it? Let's start with Detective mode. It works like the other games, you activate it with a single button button push, but this time you have to manually scan certain objects with your mouse to check whether you can interact with it or not. You can know the game inside and out, but you will always need to scan it before you can do something that allows you to progress, but this seems to happen selectively depending on the object. This basically means you'll stop dead in your tracks everytime to scan that darn wall just one more time to make sure you can't blow it up. I hope you don't mind this, because you probably will have to leave an area and going to a part you haven't explored yet, because you'll find you don't have the item you need. To be fair, the game most of the time tells you where to go and just not how to get there unless it glitches out and it doesn't appear on the map which has actually happened to me. It's still frustrating to have your progress come to a complete halt, because you don't have a certain utility weapon or missed scanning something. This brings us to exploring. You're always stuck on a 2D plane, however you'll find you can go to different directions with vents or using your grappling hook to get to the background or suddenly the room decides there will be a sharp turn you can take. This doesn't sound too bad, but it makes the map look like an absolute cluster‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. You'll check it every five seconds to make sure you're not heading the wrong way, but it won't help you get into certain rooms, because of some doors are unmarked and rooms with multiple floors are confusing as hell. God forbid you backtrack and forgot how to progress in the room, because of the lack of visual indicators or a helpful map. It doesn't help that the game's levels have no real visual identity and that Batman walks very slowly. To top it all off, there are so many times when a room just locks you out. What I mean by this is that sometimes the game will arbitrarily decide to not let you backtrack the way you came. For example if you use your grappling hook to reach a certain ledge, there's a chance the game won't let you go back by gliding. This means taking a huge detour everytime to go back where you started. Hope you didn't miss anything.\n\nLet's talk about that: the control. This game controls horrible. Combat is terrible. I refuse to believe you can pull off crazy combos like in the other Arkham games. Batmans range for punches and kicks isn't consistent, sometimes hits won't connect and counters flat-out don't work half the time. Not that the game is impossibly hard or anything, because the game is very generous with health and doesn't throw tons of enemies at you all at once. Stealth isn't much better. There are usually only three for each sections and your options are severely limited. It works, but it's watered down. Bosses are the worst aspect of the game. They're deceptively simple, but have little indicators to teach you how they're supposed to work. Penguin is the worst example as he summons goons that can only be taken out in a specific way. If you don't know to beat them, they're practically invincible.\n\nBesides that there really isn't that much to talk about. The music is generic and I don't want to say anything about the graphics because it's a port of a handheld game anyway. Mooks look less like zombies at least, but I still don't get the cutscenes. Why does nobody look like their in-game model. WHO DREW THESE?\n\nSo in conclusion this game is bad. Don't waste your money. You're better off with Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. Heck even Arkham Knight and Origins are better than this.","April 13","false","8.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

I ended up enjoying it quite a bit. I think a lot of the negative views of this game center around a couple things:\n\n1. This is not a platformer nor a brawler. If you go into this game thinking it will be like its fully 3D Arkham bretheren, you will be greatly disappointed. However, if you go into this game knowing and expecting it to be more like a classic Metroid game, then you will be okay. Blackgate was clearly meant to be more about Batman as a detective and a puzzle solver than about Batman the asskicker.\n\n2. The controls could be better. But again, I think this is more about expectations. If you think it's going to be a precise brawler like its bigger brothers, you'll hate it. It's meant to be a slower-paced, puzzle-solving and exploration game truly in the same vein as something like Metroid (minus the shooting). I was put off at first, but once I got used to the pacing I started to enjoy the game a lot (Metroid/Zelda-style games are my personal favorite).\n\nThere are other minor quibbles, such as it having a confusing map, and less-than-stellar combat, but overall it is a good game. If you like Batman and/or Metroid, you'll likely enjoy this game. Don't buy it if you want a platformer or brawler.","June 13, 2014","true","11.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You feel like Batman, and the combat has a similar free-flowing mechanic from the "big" games (although it IS different). The gadgets also all work as they should.\n\nHowever, this game suffers from not knowing if it wants to be 2D, or 3D. Let me explain. The game is a 2D sidescroller: you move on a certain path, and always go left to right. But here they got creative, and added multiple routes that can make you change direction, for example by entering a vent. And this leads to very confused navigation.\nThe in-game map is nearly useless. Because Batman changes direction automatically while moving, you need to constantly check on the map where you are now headed, and since it is drawn on an angle to begin with, with overlapping segments, you WILL get lost.\n\nI also got stuck multiple times. There are moments where the plot forces you go go to a certain area which ends in a blocked door, because you do not have the proper gadget yet, and it expects you to find the one spot in several screens that can be bombed to create an opening.\nRemember how in e.g. Zelda any wall that can be bombed is marked with cracks? Not in this game. You must enter inspection mode, and literally sweep the entire screen of multiple rooms in the hope of finding the one spot which is "structurally weak", so you can progress.\n\nThe story is weak. You have three opponents, one opponent-slash-ally, and then they suddenly throw in Solomon Grundy... for a single fight, with no build-up whatsoever. The only reason Grundy seems to be thrown in is to emulate the Killer Croc fight from the first Arkham game.\n\nI like the graphics, at their best they look very much like the big games. But the cutscenes are done in a highly distorted comic style, which really don't fit the look of the rest of the game. They would have been a lot better if they had been done in-engine, there are a number of "cinematic" scenes that are done this way and those look pretty amazing.\nAnd while the voice acting is top notch, there is no lip sync whatsover: characters either "talk" in the cutscenes, which are little more than moving comic panels, or in-game, where their mouths never move.\n\nPick this up if you like Arkham Origins and want more, but skip it if you're not a huge fan of the game series. If this were a numeric review, I'd give it a 6//10.","May 15, 2014","true","17.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There are nice comic book style cut scenes, mostly decent boss battles and some replayability. They tried to incorporate the Arkham freeflow combat system which, given the 2.5D perspective, works well for the most part. That said, it is vastly inferior to that of the Arkham games. Since the game does have a lot of backtracking, the biggest source of frustration is the map. Navigating around the areas is the most challenging part of the game. The game is still quite enjoyable though and so I would recommend it.","October 25, 2014","true","39.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I probably wouldn't have played it otherwise despite loving the Arkham series and even being a fan of the often maligned Arkham Origins.  This game was originally designed for handheld consoles like the 3DS and Vita and it shows - what works on those consoles doesn't necessarily work on the PC, where the combat (a mainstay of the series) feels shallow and lacks impact and the graphics - while nice - don't live up to prior games in the series.\n\nThe story is reasonable but sadly it lacks in the most important department - the thug banter.  The personality and charm that this gave to other games in the series is completely lacking here, thugs barely talk and when they do they don't have much to say.  To make matters worse, there is no postgame content - if you don't complete everything before the final Boss you have to start all over again.  To make matters even worser, the game cuts off access to particular rewards.  This means you need at least a total of three complete playthroughs if you're a completionist, and the game honestly isn't good enough to warrant another go around.\n\nIt's not bad, but it's got nothing really going for it beyond the license and the goodwill of the other games in the series.  It was fine enough to play, but not anything I'd recommend going out of your way to get to.  You'll probably end up more frustrated than anything else, thinking about what could have been.","May 22","false","14.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I wont comment on graphics, because I don't play games for graphics, and nobody should. About gameplay, well here were a bit of problems with controls and there were some stupid game mechanics that became very annoying after a while!\n\nAbout controlls first:\nThe controlls are  pretty responsive, but there were some times when you had to do/press a button multiple times for it to work, which can get very annoying after a time, especially if you have to hury because a timer.\nFor example: When you do the bomb hunting/hostage rescuing at the end of the game and you have to enter a went by holding the A button on a 360 pad, and it wont register after a few times, not until you go away from the went hole and go back for it to show the (Hold A to Enter). This is very annoying!\nOther problems I didn't encounter with the controlls, other than this, the controlls are great and very easy to learn.\n\nMechanics:\nThe only annoying mechanics in the game for me was the Scanner!\nIn the beginning I thought of it as a  neat feature, but after a while it got so annoying that you had to do it almost every time for you to go on ahead! Even for things that were staright forward and didn't need any further explanation!\nOther than this little annoying thing, haven't really got any more issues with the game.\n\nThe game itself is on the shorter side because you can beat it in 3 or 4 hours most IF you don't do any side content and exploring! Your very first playthrough may be a bit longer if you like to stop from the main story and do a bit of exploring.\nKeep in mind that by exploring I don't mean to explore the entire map or anything like in the past games, because this isn't a full 3D game, it's just a 2.5D platformer, but believe me that you can get lost very easily.\nI myself, when I did my first playthrough of this, it took me roughly 15hours, because I did collect everything and did all the side content, but my other playthrougs were only about 3 or 4 hours as I said earlier because I just rushed from start to finish to get all the endings.\n\nAnd yes, it's true that you'll have to do a bit of backtracking when you hunt for the collectibles, but it's not that bad!\n\nFrom my experience and for being a huge Batman fan, with all the little flaws that this game has, I'll give it a 7.5/10.\nIt's not a great game, but it's not bad either!

So keep that in mind.\n\nFirst: The port is not that great. You can only change AA whether it's or not and depth of field. That's it. However it runs pretty okay, especially on my piece of junk laptop thats 6 years old, with only minor slow down here and there.\n\nSecond: This is a 2.5D game, you will always be running left and right with some spots to either grapple into the background or forground. But it's still 2D. Is this bad? No. Is this complicated? I got lost walking once in my small home town, I'm bad when it comes to maps and I haven't got lost once in this game yet and I have no issues with it. So no, it's not hard.\n\nCombat: Combat is mostly the same as the main series games, it's just limited to left and right, instead of full 3D. Is this bad? No, it looks weird at first but it's still fine and still feels good to pound the badguys. You can't do all the fancy stuff of the main series but it's still fun.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty decent as is the story. As many reviews have pointed out, the cutscenes are comic book style and that's pretty awesome! It looks good to like it was actually from a comic book.\n\n\nTL;DR: The port is bad, get over it. It's all 2D so you only have to worry about left and right, the map is not that complicated and it's still fun. Why are people complaining? Because it's different than the main series of games, yes, get over it. It's a lot of fun.","December 17, 2014","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just know that this game is Arkham in name only. Blackgate is a 2.5D exploration platformer, not a 3D third person game like the rest of the series. If you aren't a fan of metroidvanias, this game is definately not going to win you over. The story is very dull, and overly simplistic. Basically there is an explosion at Blackgate and now the criminals are running the place. That's pretty much it as far as the story goes, sadly.\n\nAs metroidvanias go, the game mechanics are very weak, due to linear level design, and uninspired combat. If you aren't a Batman fan, you'll probably get bored quickly with the repetitive levels and linear flow. I really can't recommend this game on it's mechanics alone.\n\nIf you happen to like Batman, and you like metroidvanias, Blackgate just might have enough to merit a purchase. The entire game environment is rendered in 3D, despite movement being locked to 2.5D. It's doesn't look as good as the main Arkham games, but it doesn't look like a Vita port either, probably somewhere in between. The environments are actually rendered with a very high attention to detail, especially for a 2.5D game. Some people have had issues with the controls. I played through using a gamepad and had zero issues. Probably the best thing about this game is the animatics created by Calum Alexander Watt and Armature Studio.  You can see several examples here[conceptartworld.com]. As I said before, the mechanics aren't the greatest, but if you like metroidvanias, there might be enough nooks and cranies to explore, collectibles, and upgrades to unlock, to keep you going between animatics.\n\nMarking this as "recommened" for the niche audience that the game was made for. Everyone else should look elsewhere.\n\nDon't pay more than: $10","January 28, 2015","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They are quite different. Blackgate is more about running around in a maze-like platformer, acquiring gadgets to pass obsticles, collecting collectables, and doing it all again over and over until you have completely exhausted the game. Doesn't sound like the game for you? Stay away. Still interested, and read on...\n\nBlackgate is definitely a game with a lot of problems, but if you can get past them, you'll still enjoy the game:\n*Incredibly easy to get lost and the map is of very little help until you have played through enough to just about have the area memorized anyway. Prepare to spend vast swaths of time trying to figure out how to get back into "that one place you feel like you just came from."\n*Really annoying method of discovering secrets, by stopping, and physically scanning every nook and cranny of the room. Really breaks up the pacing of the game, and you don't feel like you were outsmarted when you miss a secret. You just feel like you were too impatient to spend the extra time scanning that remote area.\n*Voice acting is pretty sub-par. The same voice actors are back (except Black Mask for some reason) from Arkham Origins, but it's clear that something was different about the directing in this one. It just doesn't sound real. Everything is forced.\n*High Definition "Delux Edition" makes it obvious that most character mouths and faces aren't actually animated.\n*Story is not all that interesting, and only the final cutscenes of the game really add anything of value to the Arkhamverse.\n*Combat feels less refined than the regular Arkham games. Very easy to miss an attack that past experience tells you ought to hit.\n\nPros:\n*The animated cutscenes are kind of cool, even if they couldn't afford to do a full-on cartoon animation.\n*Collecting Batsuits is fun. Who doesn't like to play dress-up?\n*Picking up a new gadget is extra-rewarding because it means you're able to get into new areas.\n*Achievements incentivise repeat playthroughs.\n*Graphically it's not that bad considering it was originally a handheld game.\n*It's the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Batman.","May 20, 2014","true","54.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have been extremely impressed in my first few hours with the game.\n\nIt's not as good as the other games (of course), but that's impossible with these limitations. However, the combat is fun if somewhat limited, there's lots of batclawing, exploding, detective moding, exploring and whatnot. There's not the open-world flying, but Arkham Asylum didn't really have that either.  The odd thing is that this one has more of an explorative... mazelike... dungeon feel to it, which I thought was pretty cool/fun.  It is closer to Arkham Asylum than the other, open-world game.  Which I don't think is necessarily bad, just different.\n\nI do see why people would not recommend it, since the other games are all better (because they didn't have to run on a handheld). However, if you've already played all the other ones (Asylum, City, and Origins), then this one should be next on your list to play IMO because it really is a good game. It's definitely a batman game :)\n\n\n\nSIDE NOTE JUST IN CASE A DEV READS THIS: The main two things that would need changing (which I think would still let it run on a handheld) would be (A) fully rotatable map on all axis, and (B) minor tweaks to detective scan mode, (C) quicker restarts for boss fights.\n\n(A) The map is set currently in an isometric locked view, which has limitations when showing the map from the perspective of the user, height of objects, and depth in complex situations (like a large sprawling map). I really like that the maps are huge and complex, and I don't really have that big of a problem reading the map (but probably because I use Computer Aided Drafting a lot), but I can see it being very difficult for many people to use.\n\n(B) Currently, the detective mode only highlights main, mostly obvious items in the environment (switches, thugs, keypads, doors, stuff like that). To find explodables, blood, or some collectables, you have to hold down the detective button and it scans in a circle. There needs to be an upgrade somewhere in the game (and maybe there is) that enlargens the circle and speeds up the scanning speed by at least 2 times the speed. These are really my only two complaints about the game that would be fixable within the technical limitations. I think that's pretty good considering it ran on a handheld.  Don't get me wrong, I do not want you to just change it to how the other games have it.  I actually do not like having to be in detective mode so much, so that's why I like the scanning function, but it needs to be faster and more responsive is all (even if it's 33% into the game).\n\n(C) For boss fights, when you have to try them multiple times, you are forced to not only skip the boss intro cinematic, but also watch the first part of the boss intro that is unskippable (which is not long).  On normal fights with previously seen and predictable components, this is fine.  However, all of the boss fights have a "figure it out" part to them (which I don't mind), but having to repeat much of the fight which I have already seen/dealt with does get frustrating since each of the bossfights have a "OH that's what I should do..." moment.  At that point, the player just wants to dive back in quickly and try it again.\n\nI'm only mentioning these things though, because I'm hopeful that there will be a sequel that incorporates these elements, because I would totally buy it for PC :)   I was reluctant because of the bad PC reviews, but I was very glad I didn't skip this one.\n\nAlso I saw some videos of the handheld version, and you guys did a great job upgrading it to be closer to a PC gamer fidelity.  I know some people complained about the graphics, but I thought they were fine for what you were working with (and I know they are just longing for the other Batman game's graphics).","October 12, 2014","true","9.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Also the fact that you often have to analyze before you can interact with the enviroment is going to test your patience because it takes like three freaking seconds to analyze, so put yourself in someone who plays this game and you know where to go but everytime you get somewhere you need to stop and wait three seconds like every 30 seconds, who designed this crap?\n\nOh yeah the game was released april the first what a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing genious joke that is, because this whole game is an direct insult to the whole arkham series!","January 2","false","5.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

They should give people free season pass for BAK, instead of this crappy game and other batman games that everyone already own and for which nobody recieved a gift copy. After playing this a little i feel like i dont even need this game for free!\nBlackgate is good illustration of retardation of mobile gaming nowadays. Platformer without jump button - what a joke! All you do in this game - kick asses of several enemies for about 1 minute, then walk left or right like 2 minutes, and press RB to hook up to only possible place, then this repeats. Sometime game allows you to imitate some mechanics of Arkham like stealthing, or detective mode investigation, but yet again everything is done with one one button - you just move stick until you see some object, or your just move from one fixed point to another with RB and autoglide on guards.\n\nSaddest thing about this game - it actually had potential that developers wasted by designing it for "one touch" experience, i think instead of making port as is for PC they should have improved gameplay, give people more of free control over actions of batman, allow to jump, allow to fall, allow to aim for the point of hooking, make battles more challenging and advanced, by unlocking ability to move up and down on ground - and that would be good game, like prince of persia meets double dragon. However they gave no crack and released this iPhonish abomination as is, and it just terrible.\n\nBatman games on NES still much better than this, even with worse graphics.\n\nPhones need to get back dpad and at least 4 face buttons and 2-4 shift buttons, because touch screens totally ruined mobile gaming, games on siemens and nokia symbian smartphones (like n-gage) was way more advanced than crap like this (that imitates games with one click context actions, but not really offer true gaming expirience) we have now.

The pattern is present by early adulthood and occurs across a variety of situations and contexts.\n\nOther symptoms usually include intense fears of abandonment and intense anger and irritability, the reason for which others have difficulty understanding.People with BPD often engage in idealization and devaluation of others, alternating between high positive regard and great disappointment. Self-harm and suicidal behavior are common.\n\nThe disorder is recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Because a personality disorder is a pervasive, enduring, and inflexible pattern of maladaptive inner experiences and pathological behavior, there is a general reluctance to diagnose personality disorders before adolescence or early adulthood. However, some emphasize that without early treatment symptoms may worsen.\n\nThere is an ongoing debate about the terminology of this disorder, especially the suitability of the word "borderline".The ICD-10 manual refers to the disorder as Emotionally unstable personality disorder and has similar diagnostic criteria. In the DSM-5 the name of the disorder remains the same as in previous editions.","January 27, 2015","true","2.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","1"

But since it's in 2D, you never know what guy Batman will hit. And, of course, he always hits the one with the shoker stick or the one who can block. This makes fighting the generic enemies really frustrating.\n\nIn contrast, the bosses are too easy. I've defeated Solomon Grundy on the first try in less than a minute.\n\nSecondly, looking for secrets and navigating levels in general is boring. Many people find the map in the game confusing, but it was pretty easy to understand for me. The real problem is the level design itself. The levels are too small. and it's like the same rooms/ventilation shafts/tunnels all over again.\n\nThirdly, the story is really lacking and even the Joker feels boring and dumb.\n\nFinally, my gamepad (360 controller for windows) is switching off every 20-30 seconds when playing this game for no reason. Since it works fine in other games, I believe this has something to do with the way the game itself. And to make things even worse, the default keys when playing on mouse/keyboard are not remappable. For instance, I cannot bind "crouch" to C because the key is bound to something else.\n\nI really tried to love this game, but the problems with the controls were the final thing I'm giving up on this.","December 28, 2015","false","5.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Trivial stupidities (Batman can't jump? Mapping multiple controls to the same button so you end up doing the wrong thing in many situations, bonus 'clues' that have no indication unless you stumble on them in the detective mode, random first person view used when you are in some airvents) are compounded by one of the worst boss 'fights' in a game (Penguin's), and a map that is more confusing than useful, and enemies that can only be defeated by one idiotic method, and fighting controls that don't translate to 2D cleanly.  There are so many missteps that the last two hours of play I was gritting my teeth and forcing myself through.  And I deleted it as soon as I finished - I don't care about the detective cases I didn't finish, or the videos I didn't unlock (I'm guessing because only one of each version can be unlocked per playthrough).

It is a waste of time, money, effort, and constantly frustrates you if you're an Arkham fan.\n\nFor some reason, they decided to make it so you control Batman FROM THE SIDE like some kind of Mario side-scroller game, making it IMPOSSIBLE to be stealthy as well as hiding enemies from your line of sight while you're traveling so that they can jump you.\n\nNot only that, but the "cutscenes" are just lame little comic book pictures with a moving hand here or a cigarette with smoke that moves there. It makes you feel completely disconnected from the story as every other moment is interrupted by one of these so-called "cutscenes." As if not feeling like Batman could be in danger wasn't already disconnected!\n\nOne of my biggest beefs was the first boss fight. It threw you in there with a comic book cutscene, then said, "Have at it!" without giving you ANY advice whatsoever, expecting you to KNOW how to beat him - with your 5 basic moves... It took me a few tries on NORMAL to figure out what to do, each time having to wait 10 seconds to skip the annoying cutscene.\n\nAnother beef I have is that the game STARTS with a cutscene - so you KNOW it's probably going to be a bad game. After the intro cutscene, you jump right in to a fight with some security guards as Catwoman escapes from her most recent burglary.\n\nThen, you have to follow her around - which is quite difficult given the 2D atmosphere yet making you make choices as if it were 3D (grappling onto something in the background, for instance). You finally capture her and send her to Blackgate, which then gets taken over by the Joker, Black Mask, and Penguin. So you go there and work out a deal to team up with her (though you never play as her or see her except in the comic cutscenes), and start beating stuff up.\n\nIn fact, that's all this game is. You follow the yellow-brick road since you're practically NAILED to it - no free movement whatsoever - and beat up stuff along the way in a weird attempt at the Super Mario Bros. meets Prison Break.\n\nNow, I know I sound really harsh, but trust me - I'm practically UNDER-exaggerating the crud this game hands to you. I even gave it the benefit of the doubt - I truly hoped it would get better - and gave it about an hour's try. Now I wish I had that hour back, along with my $20 and 2 GB of Hard Drive Disc space. Yeah, it's only 2 GB (other Arkham games range in the late 20's). That can give you an idea about how much - or should I say, how little - the content is in this game.\n\n\n\n\nRATING: 1 star (out of 10)","July 8, 2014","false","1.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Tons of backtracking, then you finally beat the three bosses only to find out that there are 5 objectives hidden somewhere on the entire map, therefore you must once again backtrack all over the place to find them and their locations are based off of which boss you beat last.  If that isn't enough, one of the variations requires you to find 3 junction boxes for each objective within a time limit, so guess what?  More backtracking and seeing portions of the map you have seen many times before!!!  As an extra bonus, sometimes the junction boxes may not register as being blown up with the explosive gel, so it may take two or more attempts for the game to realize that you have indeed blown them all up.\n\nI swear, this game has more padding than a flat-chested girl's bra on prom night.  Off to YouTube to see how it ends and ties into everything.  Oh, and a pro-tip for Bats:  Next time you plan on going into a maximum security prison that holds all of your major foes.....

I was wrong. The story was decent enough and a good epilogue to Arkham Origins, but sadly everything else is lacking.\n\nThe main problem is the combat. The game is just not fun to play. The Free Flow which works so well in the main series games is back, except in 2D it barely functions at all. Without freedom of movement, the combat is boring and badly executed. Also, the game's stealth mechanics are laughable--one wrong move and instant fail.\n\nMy main gripe with the game is the horrible, horrible mechanics. For instance, there is a hacking minigame which is decent enough until you get to the end of the game. Then, they make you backtrack around the entire facility using their terrible in-game map, tacking a totally unnecessary hour onto the game's length. And guess what happens if you fail this hacking minigame? You get sent back several minutes and have to do it all over again.\n\nThat's another problem I had with the game. All the boss fights are one-wrong-move-instant-fails with no mid-fight checkpoints and you have to listen to the terrible intro every single time for no reason. Most of the bosses are extremely repetitive and boring, as well.\n\nOverall, even if you're a big Batman Arkham fan, this game just isn't worth the frustration. What could have been a unique, satisfying Metroidvania-style experience is ruined by bad controls, gameplay and combat. Even for a dollar, it just isn't worth playing.","September 20, 2014","false","6.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Plus honestly, I am not ready to spend more than 40 hours playing a reportedly mediocre open-world third-person action game when I already have a backlog of games to get through.\n\nHowever, I decided to give 'Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate' (AOB) a try as it looked like an accessible Batman game that I could play intermittently until the release of 'Batman: Arkham Knight'. (The low price point was appealing, too.) Sad to say, I found myself feeling underwhelmed with what I played. The pairing of anime-style cutscenes and 2.5D in-game graphics, while looking fantastic in the trailer, proved to be a mismatch. The 'Metroid'-like side-scrolling gameplay also failed to create an immersive environment and somehow made me feel lost most of the time.\n\nThe 2.5D graphics looked dated despite some remastering for this PC port, and they proved to be the game's undoing as well. I was never quite sure where I could use my grapple gun, drop down a ledge and throw my Batarang without the help of on-screen notifications. Because of that, what could have been great puzzles to solve ended up being hand holding the player through a series of now mundale challenges and quick time events. Plus, needing to use Detective Vision to identify hotspots prior to using some of my gadgets interrupted the flow of the game.\n\nI wanted to finish 'AOB' to see the entire story through, but then I realized the story was pretty much the one from 'Arkham Asylum', but done poorly. I saw no signs of story or character development six hours into the game. 'AOB' was unnecessary in the 'Arkham' mythos that Rocksteady had created. After I decided to suffer through the remainder of the game, it crashed and I lost my save file. (Yes, the game failed to save my game properly as well.) I took that as a sign to not waste my time with 'AOB' and to wait patiently for 'Arkham Knight' instead.","September 2, 2014","false","6.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The story is not really as deep as the other chapters. Level design is ok, a bit weird to navigate through the maps but can be dealt with. I did not finish the game, it simply didn't interest me enough. If you have a PS vita, buy this on vita, it would make a good airplane trip game (because anyway PS vita doesn't really have many good games). On PC you can dedicate your time to better titles. I recommend this on PS vita given the lack of valid games on it, and given that the game is not really BAD in all its aspects. It makes sense on PS vita but not on PC.

In presentation it's really just a much more scripted version of the Arkham series with comic-based cutscenes.  That's not a bad thing, of course, but it feels a little odd to have all of your grapple points set for you after the free roaming of earlier games.   The thing that bothers me the most, though, is that absolutely none of the combat timing seems to carry over to this game from previous games in the series.  There's a small but very significant delay between button press and action that make countering a surprisingly irritating trial.  I'm used to countering just before the blow lands, whereas here you've got to hit counter literally the instant the blue lines show up to have any hope at all of actually performing the action in time.  Perhaps I'll come back to it later, but for now I'm too frustrated with this to find any real fun in it.","July 9, 2014","false","1.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Honestly, I can say I shouldn't have bothered. I don't know what it was like before the "deluxe" upgrade, but this version certainly doesn't help much either. Perhaps if this had been the original game that started it all (then jumped to 3D with Asylum) a lot of the game's problems wouldn't be seen as such and it could've been a overwhelming good time. As it is now, the game is basically a regressed version of the series, plagued with too many fun sucking aspects, ranging from plain annoyances to full on boneheaded (spike strips).\n\nStory:\n\n+Comic cutscenes are nice\n-Story itself wasn't anything special\n\nCombat:\n\n-All that you may be familiar with has been stripped away: speed, precision, quickfire gadgets, even the freaking slide tackle is gone! Throughout the whole game I would still instinctively try to pull these things off during combat to no avail because the actions are so ingrained in me.\n-Enemies freely move in and out of your plane, causing you to miss sometimes. Other times, Batman doesn't focus on the right target, which at worst case scenario leads to you hurting yourself by attacking a stun baton wielding enemy head on.\n-Boss fights, while unique, don't offer much to delight in as they are simple and quickly over.\n\nPlatforming/Exploration:\n\n+The only change to the formula I did like was the new cryptographic hacking. Instead of twiddling the sticks to form words in the other games, here you have a grid of numbers that you move a box over to match up a 3 digit sequence.\n+Lots of areas to cover\n\n-Lack of quick exit/travel to the 3 main branches of the prison. Later on there are a couple of shortcuts that will take you from one to another but they aren't labeled on the map in any noticeable way so you'll probably have a difficult time remember them.\n-Map can be confusing at times since it isn't rotatable and multiple pathways will overlap each other\n-Spike strips on the floor. Really, who in their right mind came up with this genius obstacle? Sorry, player, we're going to make it travel even more of a chore by having you need to keep your eyes out for these instead of being able to tune out while you only want to get from one end of the room to the other. And naturally since Batman is just starting out and hasn't yet trained a day in his life, he can't merely hop over these tiny hindrances. Instead you have to double tap the button to roll over and avoid damage. If this causes you to exit and delete the game in the first 15 minutes, I completely understand (I'm dead serious, these things are pure garbage.)\n\nIf you're really dying for more Batman after the main games (and at this time before Arkham Knight's release) then you could go for this at a budget price. I did though and throughout I didn't feel it was worth the time.","July 22, 2014","false","14.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

If you like the Arkham games and aren't particularly a Batman fan than I say avoid this one at all costs. This is definitely a game made for when you have down times while commuting to school/work or just simply when you can't reach your PC/Console.\n\nPros- Good voice acting, decent story, metroidvania style. New game plus. SUITS\nCons- Awful combat, butchered stealth mechanics, and a horrible map.\n\nThe stealth in this game is pretty much non existant and I am glad that there were only a few sections (All of which I was never able to properly sneak through because of the poorly implemented gameplay mechanics)\n\nThe combat is very sloppy as well and waters down the free-flow combat until it is nothing but generic.\n\nI wish the developers had stuck to their guns and created a fresh experiance because they absolutely failed when it came to borrowing Rocksteady's core gameplay mechanics. However I did think that their own innovations were very clever and spot on for a Batman game. (Gel Launcher is such a cool gadget and should be included in the next Arkham game.) I also enjoyed the puzzles and exploring the map but the in-game map that they gave us was very confusing because of the 2.5D view they gave us. (Example) When you enter a vent from the right you could be facing left when you exit the vent. This certainly caused alot of problems during my playthrough of the game and I have seen this issue brought up many times during LPs of the game on Youtube.\n\nI enjoyed this game but I can't recommend this one in good conscience because Batman is my 2nd favorite Superhero. Although I am a bit bias allow me to take off my rose colored glasses and give this game a proper score:\n\n6/10","April 23, 2014","false","13.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

I love the arkham games. I love Batman. I love metroidvania games. But this was just absolutely awful. The graphics look like something from a PS2. The gameplay is stiff and difficult to figure out. The mechanics are unreliable. The combat is broken. Everything about this game was terrible.\n\nHere, let me be helpful. I'm in the second stealth room of the game. THere are no gargoyles and 4 men in a 2D hallway. I'm up on a ledge and i see one guy turn around. I take him out and move forward waiting for the next guy to turn around so I can make my move, instead he just sits there. I try to approach him and trigger a response, but instead he just shoots me as he just barely comes into view. I try again and notice that i can use detective vision. I tag a floor grate THAT WAS PRACTICALLY INVISIBLE and figure thats what im supposed to use. No big deal, just getting used to how the game is played. I take out the first guy again, move towards the grate, go in, start moving forward, and he sees me. WHILE IM IN THE GRATE!!!!! Thats like, all the enemies using xray googles in a steath game. Whats the point of hiding if it doesn't work?\n\nThe combat is broken too. I start the game on hard, i figure since I'm really good at the 3D batman games this one should be easy peasy right? Well i guess the developers thought it was too easy because the counter mechanic doesn't work consistently at all. I fight my first wave of enemies and even though im pressing the counter button when they attack it's not working at all. I do defeat them, but anticipating the pain that the game is going to give me i switch to normal mode. Even with the counter icons i can't do it. I press the counter button when my spidersense tingles, but i don't counter. The same thing happens when i battle catwoman for the first time. Not only was she one giant QTE, but it took forever just because the mechanic doesn't work.\n\nWhen you play an Arkham game you expect things to have a rhythm and flow during combat. everything was cut short, choppy, stiff, or inconsistent. It was painful to play. I didn't think A:Origins held up to the standards of the series, but at least it was decent. This was just an awful painful mess.  I may not have gotten very far, but i had more than enough. I didn't have high expectations going in, but now my expectations are even lower. If i ever get through my backlog (Ha, that was funny) i might might might pick it back up. But for now the pain is just to real. Save yourself. Stay away from this pain.\n\nOh and those cutscenes everyone raves about? don't believe them. They look muddy and gross. I like my drawings to have a pop at the edges, not this mushy garbage. Maybe it looks better on a smaller screen (cough cough, cashin on a portable game, cough cough).","June 20, 2014","false","4.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

While the level design is fairly well done and the game does a good job of providing Metroidvania-esque exploration, it fails in almost every other way. First off, while the level design is good, the navigation is a pain. The "world" is split into three maps, which you have to enter/exit from the front door/back door, which are not easily accessible from most of the map, causing a large portion of backtracking to be for the sole purpose of leaving your current area. To complicate things further, the map is very poorly displayed, particularly in regards to areas with multiple height levels, which can make finding your way around extremely obnoxious.\n\nThe freeflow combat from the previous games is forced into the 2D perspective, which makes targeting enemies impossible, (you can only attack people directly in front or behind you) and often times they will strafe into the foreground or background which makes it difficult, sometimes literally impossible, to hit them. The predator aspect has almost been entirely removed for this game, and when it does show up, performs terribly, as without the three dimensional movement, there is no way to hide or sneak about other than running away.\n\nIn addition, blocks/counters don't seem to register half the time and there are no rebindable controls, with the default controls being incredibly odd, making controlling an issue on top of the gameplay issues. In regards to plot, it is extremely simple and is told in such a simple way that you'll get the same level of investment in the game from reading a paragraph long summary of the plot on Wikipedia. In short, I highly recommend that even avid Batman fans avoid this game, as you'll only be disappointed at best, absolutely infuriated at worst.","October 23, 2014","false","24.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I hated most of my time with it. This is a sloppy sloppy game. Ironically this is a very poor Metroidvania game. Very odd since the Arkham Asylum pulled it off flawlessly and it was in 3D. This has an issued where if you complete a task or combat the camera zooms to the "action". It wouldn't be so annoying if your character wouldn't freeze and you could still take damage during these time period. Another thing I hated was the boss fights, some of them were one mistake kills that were abusively difficult. There are a lot of interactable objects, floors, and walls. Unfortunately you can't interact with them until you scan them. Which is tedious. In fact that is all this game is, extra steps to pad the length of it. When I finished I was surprised to see I had only been playing nine hours. It felt like a brutal 30 hour grind. The cutscenes are garbage and the story is forgetable.

If you're expecting a 2d version of the Arkham games by Rocksteady or WB Montreal, you're going to be disappointed. The combat has been limited to punching, stunning, and evading. No takedowns or insane combo's here, the fighting is anemic compared to the other Arkham titles and isn't the core of the game. This is a major plus due to the fact that this game is a Metroidvania type of game with the cape crusader. The graphics are better than the previous portable literation but that is not saying much, some textures are muddy, or stretched out and this is especially true during fights when you see prison inmates look like they have melted Crayola marks as tattoos on their arm when the camera zooms in. Batman looks great though. Furthermore the map used to find clues is horrendous, it makes finding certain items at times hair pulling or impossible until you look online to see where it is ( EX: Crowbar that is needed for a case). On the positive the game is enjoyable if you like going around the environment collecting things , finding upgrades , Batman suits (Zombie Suit is worth the hunt!), and so forth. You can tackle the 3 main areas anyway you please which is nice, as each different play through rewards you different Batman suits . Aside from the exploration, I found the story enjoyable, it‚Äôs there but it doesn't affect the gameplay too much. If you are on the fence on this one wait for a sale, I got this for $5 and I think that is probably the fairest price one should pay for this if they want to try it out.

You CAN double tap the action button and roll, and sometimes that will get you over the spikes, but this only works about 25% of the time.\n\nThe combat against regular enemies is just button mashing, much like the other Arkham games. Only here, you don't even choose which targets to attack, you just spam melee and occasionally stun or jump over someone.\n\nThe bosses are horrid, and the main reason why I can't recommend this game. They are super scripted, multi phase fights with no check points. The problem comes from the controls being what they are, which makes what would be decent fights into brutally difficult excercises in frustration.\n\nThe map is a piece of crap. It's fixed angle, but room layouts are completely arbitrary and don't follow the map in logical ways.\n\nThe rest is kind of meh. Decent music. Graphics aren't bad considering they came from a portable. Voice acting is...passable. And the collecting is alright, from what I got into. I quit when I got to the penguin because he's impossibly hard for no good reason.\n\nWhy can we not have good metroidvania games made these days? It can't be THAT hard.\n\nIf you pay more than 2 bucks, you got ripped off.","July 2, 2014","false","3.2"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Unfortunately, a title is all it seems to have.\n\nBlackgate offers players a multilayered 2D approach to batman, not terribly unlike some of the challenge maps in Arkham City. It's also more of a comic book experience than a cinematic one, with framed panels guiding certains segments of story. A cute, and with the right atmosphere, fun dynamic. Neither are things that Blackgate seems to master.\n\nBlackgate, in contrast to its Arkham series cohorts, is slow instead of fast, chunky instead of fluid, poorly structured instead of well built, and ultimately just dissapointing. The story is contrived, the controls are terrible, and the graphics mediocre. The audio is bland, the cast is stale, and whatever minute shreds of personality batman brought to these games from the beginning is almost completely gone.\n\nBlackgate is piggybacking on the success of the other arkham games in the worst possible way - unimaginatively. I'm willing to turn a blind eye to some piggybacking in the gaming industry (looking at you Kirby, Banjo/Kazooie, and Spider Man) but with the one caveat being that it's creative. If you have to hijack a moneymaking figure in order to pioneer an interesting/innovative style, dynamic, or otherwise new aspect of a game, so be it. But blackgate doesn't do that - not even a little. It uses a pre-existing formula for construction, a pre-existing character/series/universe for storytelling, a pre-existing gameplay paradigm for playability, and it does all of those things without a shred of originality or creativity. To me, that's just lazy. And to associate with a triple A title, with laziness of THIS calibre is unacceptable.\n\nBlackgate is, unfortunately, garbage. It's a prime example of something that could be good with some work and effort, but just isn't because it wasn't granted those things. I wanted it to be good and it let me down. Save yourself the time, energy, and if you still have it, the money. Don't bother with this.\n\nTL;DR: Nope. Don't play it. Bad quality all around.","February 2, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YicklePigeon/recommended/267490/","YicklePigeon","YicklePigeon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YicklePigeon/","180 products in account","What went right\nImproved backtracking -There are multiple ways of exiting each zone and it's relatively quick to do so. I understand this wasn't present in the original mobile version.\nDistinct Batsuits - It isn't a case of Arkham Origins itself, with its Batman in a different costume which can look out of place and at-odds with Arkham City's Batsuits having unique heads/bodies. Although some appear to be straight ports with detail removed, such as AO's and Red Son's suits, the others in AO Blackgate are built just for this and usually offer some gameplay benefit.\nThe pseudo-motion comics work well, though the in-game cutscenes are unskippable.\nDetective mode is sort-of improved. I like the circle allowing focus on specific areas, I don't like the repeated "analyzing" animation for things such as exploding walls, Batman should know immediately after scanning the first one to know what he's looking at.\nWhat went wrong\nPretty much everything else...\n\nBoss fights can have good ideas, but are poorly executed overall. If this wasn't a 2.5D platformer, and was Arkham City instead, the boss fights would be over in one fell swoop. I also found only the boss fight with The Penguin to auto-save your progress, so as to retry with The Penguin at his reduced health and in the final stage of the fight. The rest seemingly don't have that luxury, forcing you to go over the same stages again. The final boss fight itself has a novel twist let down by...\n...The Infamous Clunky Controls - This is not a smooth experience. Arkham Origins' movement and combat itself was, dare I say it, a hit and miss affair and not even as smooth as the original Arkham Asylum. Here? It's even worse.  Countering using the mouse often doesn't register, which is not so bad when fighting mooks but the final boss fight with Catwoman makes the game an exercise in frustration and rage (making that novel twist all for naught).  The keyboard works better, but unless you have a mechanical keyboard such as I do, it'd be cheaper (!) and possibly better to use a gamepad (and, of course, not everyone has a gamepad attached to the PC!).\nThe boss dialogue is repeitive at best. The Penguin will repeatedly announce "you hit like a ponce!" when Batman is standing still (or otherwise not fighting), and other such lines from a very limited pool of material every few seconds. I get the impression that the dialogue was designed for specific gameplay events (e.g. perhaps Batman not getting a high freeflow count), rather than the dialogue being rattled off ad nauseum.\nThe 2.5D platforming self-sabotages from the get-go. Situations with mooks could be sorted out in moments within Arkham City, but here? You may end up unable to grapple from vantage point to vantage point for seemingly no reason, or have to move the mouse cursor over the grapple point in case of standing in an area with two or more possibilities. Worse when you have to be in a particular spot.  Sometimes running (pressing space) can mean Batman interacting with the environment when you don't want him to. Other times, he just doesn't register counter button presses to literally save himself.\n\nOther than that, stealth moves can be finnicky - such as performing a floor grate takedown, where you have to be facing the right direction and be exactly under the grate behind the mook. Guns are almost instant kills and Batman still hasn't sorted out his rebreather (used in a cutscene) to filter out such gas. So it ends up being the old chestnut of a meter that quickly fills up and dissipates if you get out of the gas infested area in time.\n\nThe story is adequate but not enough to divert from the bad points. To be honest, this could have been RIddler's chance to shine as the main villain, but the villains chosen make more sense for marketing purposes than gameplay purposes. The Joker is the only one with a boss fight that entirely feeds off his character, with the last boss fight only partially using unique character traits (the other parts of that boss fight being repeats of what had gone before). The other main and secondary bosses are either retreads or generic waves of henchmen and drop down on the boss (think Catwoman vs Two-Face at the end of Arkham City).\nThe A.I. knows where you are, and will cheat - if you're spotted in a boss fight, the henchmen know precisely where you are, even when you've moved to the opposite side of the screen and avoided any further detection. Batman usually moves so slowly, that they can catch up with him relatively easily.\n\nIn closing...\nThe map can be confusing, the graphics are recycled (including animations) but with less shaders and reduced resolution for the textures (given the mobile devices the game was originally intended for) and this let's the game down when played on the PC. But it's the die-hard Arkham fan that I recommend this for, but do wait for a sale (I bought my copy from the Humble Store on sale) and you should get 7-10 hours of determined enjoyment out of it. Otherwise, get a gamepad and buy the Lego Batman games/replay the Rocksteady-made Arkham games/replay Arkham Origins/wait for Arkham Knight.","April 8, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls were intuitive and easy for me. The graphics looks great compared to PS Vita, but they are out of the league of the other Arkham games. It's worth the time and the money, considering that is a companion game.\n\nThe game is sure full of content, with some side missions desguised as Detective cases. The game is item based, meaning that you don't earn experience for what you do, but you rather collect items scathered around the map to get upgrades and more batsuits.\n\nEzio is again impersonating Batman, and the Joker, Pinguin and Black Mask returns as villains. This is the first time that Ezio faces Catwoman as a villain. Her boss figth is short and sweet. Other boss figths count on you having perfect timing and lateral thinking. They take just one to five minutes to complete.\n\nThis game again replicates the sins of his predecessors. Backtracking. You run, and run and run  from room to room to collect items that are necessary to your quest. Fights are scarce, and the predator sections of the game fails miserably to entertain.\n\nI just wanted to get over with those parts and continuining my violent tour in Blackgate, that is remiscient to the first time I toured Arkham Asylum. A lot of walking.\n\nExploring is supossed to be rewarding, but the 2.5 D environment makes the experience less inmersive, and is not very enjoyable. I got used to the map and that made my life a lot easier.\n\nThis a flawed yet entertaining game, that complements the Arham experience. Is worth the full price compared to DLCs or other titles in line with the same price point, and if you are Batman fan. There was certainly a lot of heart and effort in this title to make it a complete experience, that can stand on his own. It takes five to ten hours to complete the first run, and another five to ten to get all collectables and finish the Plus mode.\n\n","March 17, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are certain elements of the gameplay that are similar, but as it was developed for the 3DS, it does not play like the other games in the series. Batman; Arkham Origins Blackgate (BAOB) is quite unique both in the artwork used for the cutscenes and in the battle and weapons interfaces. The cutscenes are done in a cell-shading style seemingly used to create more of a comic book effect. I don't mean to say anything disparaging about the the artist, but I am not a fan. I do appreciate the talent and effort required to produce such work, but it's just not my cup of tea.\n\nThe gameplay is fair. It's hard to judge based on a familiarity with the other games in the series. The processing power of a 3DS obviously could not handle a game like the others in the series. The developers created a sort of hybrid interface, which at times works very well, and some of the battles are quite enjoyable. The problems, in my opinion, are not based so much in the combat as in the interaction with the evironment, which comprises most of the gameplay. As Batman explores Blackgate prison he typically moves from side to side as in a classic side-scroller like Super Mario Brothers, only path will often have several layers, requiring button prompts to appear on the screen to allow the player to move Batman from one layer, or path if you will, to another. This can often become very tedious and sometimes clunky. The various overlapping paths can also render the map, which can be accessed in a sub-menu, virtually useless. It can be very easy to get lost as you crawl through various vents, turn corners, and drop from the ceiling into rooms.\n\nThe story told by the forementioned cutscenes is engaging as Batman encounters Catwoman, presumably for the first time, and is pulled into a mystery that seems to take place sometime between Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. A few of  Batman's well-known adversaries must be defeated as Batman tries to regain control of the prison.\n\nIt is a good game, but not a great game. Certainly a must-have for a real Batman fan, but probably not recommended for the average gamer.\n\n7/10","October 22, 2015","true","47.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed the custscene art style, the music was solid, the script and acting was not horrible. It kept me going through the introductory act.\n\nThat reminds me, make sure you play with a controller. The damn thing is so arduous to play otherwise.\n\nAnyway, as I got into the game proper, all my hopes were dashed. "It's just not a good game," I thought, "why am I doing this to myself?" I was doing it because I have a ridiculous back log of games I've never touched that I have vowed to complete. I'm now glad I did.\n\nThe specific condition I opened with is this: Play it likes it's an old school platformer but with Batman. Super Mario Batman. Sonic the Batman. Whatever game of that ilk you like, just don't play it like it's Arkham Origins. Once I had that realization, that it's NOT like the big console games and, more importantly, that it WASN'T GOING TO BE, I had a much better time. I even enjoyed it.\n\nAgain, it's gotta be something you really just accept as it is.

You have a fairly big, complex, and non-linear map to explore.  There are plenty of unlockables to discover including access codes for new areas, upgrades for gadgets, and character skins.  There are also many hidden collectables for rewards too.\n\nThe combat is pretty good but, as this is a port from the Nintendo DS, it is not a deep as the other Arkham games.  However, enemy encounters are varied as you are put in different situations and can use the environment to your advantage such pulling away weak supports with your batclaw or cutting down hanging lights with your batarang.  You can still sneak around and perform a variety takedowns or swoop from above.  Boss fights are entertaining and varied but there are not that many as there is only one per main area.\n\nThe puzzles are good and pretty challenging as you would expect from a game originally designed for NDS gameplay.  The only real down side to this game is that scanning the environments can be tedious at times as you will need to unlock new paths and find hidden items.  Even though there is some form of fast travel for previously explore areas with unlocked elevator, you will need to backtrack quite a bit.  This is not always a bad thing as you can unlock new items you've missed and get surprised with new enemies.  Also, there are a few frustrating moments which only occur when you don't know how to solve a puzzle, approach a difficult boss, or disarm some bombs later on in the game.\n\nThe graphics have been upgraded for this version but there's still room for improvement with the textures when seen upclose which is normally when the game zooms in as Batman takes down his last foe in slow motion.  The sound, music, and voice acting is top notch as aways with this franchise.  The cutscenes are in a stylish motion comic form which I assume is feature derived from being a NDS port but they are still good quality and entertaining.\n\nThe story itself is very good and serves as a good side-story / follow-up to Arkham Origins.  Some new characters are introduced but are not seen as often as you would like.  Surprisingly, the ending will leave you wanting more as some mysteries are left to be unravelled for another time.\n\nThis is a very good game overall.  It only received hate for being a 2.5D game but if that doesn't bother you then don't miss out on a good story and great action.  Depending on the type of player you are the game can take 6-10 hours to beat on a regular play through, and 15-20 hours if you are trying to 100% the entire game.  My playthrough was inbetween as it took me 14.5 hours.  I tried to be quick but I did get distracted by searching for some unlockables.\n\nThis game is a must have for fans of the Batman Arkham franchise as well as 2.5D Metroidvania lovers.  If this game is on sale you can't go wrong.","July 3, 2015","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

How much I played previous parts, this is not a close Arkham experience in a 2.5 environment that I wanted.\n\nThe controls are bad, good, bad, bad and yeah. The boss fights are annoying most of them. Visuals are alright for a Vita Port I guess. Story is quite rich on its own way, adding some lore to Arkhamverse. VA is pretty much same as Arkham Origins which is good. The sounds, music both add some tension in battles and in different zones some exploration feeling. Many leves are badly designed, and this is the main problem here. You'll get yourself quite lost here and there, even then I tried to remember them. And after a good break you'll see that you forgot how to get back on track with such design choice.\n\nThe game itself is a mix pile of hope. Believing that you'll have some fun with a metroidvania style Batman Arkham but in the end you'll get mostly disappointed. If you really want to play it, for your on sake wait for a good discount like 75-85% off I would say.","July 10, 2015","false","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfroutanately, the way the levels are designed aren't the best and the map is shoddy at best. The combat is a barely working half the time version of the combat we know from the main-line arkham games. The story and writing are probably the weakest of the entire series. Many times I felt like I was watching a bad Saturday morning cartoon. The boss fights are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• poor. The game is ok, but barely servicble as a legitimate followup to Arkham Origins.

It is a game for PS Vita I think, which got ported over to PC for some odd reason. First of all, it is a sidescroller. Meaning most of the game you'll spend holding either A or D keys and occasionally hitting F to grapple. When you finally get into combat situations, this is where the game truly feels awful. It is so bad, so not fluid and almost impossible to see who's about to hit you. It's like sandbags punching each other... everything you learned in Arkham games you can freely forget.\n\nI won't even mention graphics because they are dissapointing. The textures are straight from PS Vita, meaning they're blurry as hell and models are awful. Seriously, these kind of games should be forbidden. Either step it up and remaster the game for the platform or simply don't port it at all.\n\nThe only impressive aspect of this game are the cutscenes... I find them very amusing and they're greatly done, but that's about it. Once the cutscenes are done, you are thrown back into very boring gameplay sequences. Hold D, hit grapple, punch thugs, repeat.\n\nI can't recommend anyone buying this, especially for the price tag. For 20‚Ç¨ you can get other much better games. For 5‚Ç¨ which is a discounted version, you can buy Tomb Raider GOTY or any other Arkham GOTY game and much more better games than this.","December 31, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are largely unresponsive (I use a Microsoft Wired Xbox 360 Pad) and so you can be pressing the counter button with it not doing anything, and the mechanics of the game are very frustrating at times. The Map is a 3D mess that is over-complicated for the game. There are times when you literally have no idea where you are or how you got there. The Boss fights are either ridiculously easy or overly hard and the fact that the game ues check points is very frustrating on the bosses. You can beat the same bosses first couple of phases over and over again, but if you die then you have to redo the entire fight from the start (including any cut scenes) which just gets overly frustrating (particularly on the Penguin boss fight because his gaurds can seem to see you even when they have their back to you).\n\nThe controls are a mess too, and so sometimes you need to hold "A" to enter a vent, sometimes its Down + "A", sometimes the Right Trigger button or sometimes its Down + Right Trigger. When you are trying to escape an enemy with a gun, you can be pressing the buttons you usually press to get away, but this particular room might have a completely differnt set of buttons. It really is just a mess.\n\nThe combat is repetitive and boring too. You can start a combo on an enemy and rather than seeing different attacks, Batman just throws the same punch over and over again until the final blow (which does differ). It just feels really lacking compared the real Arkham Games.\n\nAnother thing which is overdone and frustrating is the constant back tracking. You need to enter each wing to get a piece of Bat-Tech for the next wings Puzzle, but then have to re-enter them to get the access codes and then re-enter each one again to fight the bosses. Finally you have to re-enter them yet again because you have to disarm some Bombs which have been placed right in the dead centre of each zone. In all honesty, this game would probably last an hour if you didn't have to back track so much. It's pretty clear to me that they have just added the back-tracking in to ensure the game has a longer play time, but for me it wasn't fun, it was very boring and very frustrating getting lost constantly.\n\nI have loved all of the Arkham games and DLC and even though this was a side scroller beat em up, I wanted to love it too but I just can't. I honestly have more fun playing an old 80's side scroller like Streets of Rage or Final Fight than I had during the several hours this took to complete.\n\nI feel bad leaving this review if I am honest, but I just can't say anything nice about this game. Even the story itself is pretty bland and doesn't make much sense. I wanted to play it because I had heard it bridged the gap between Arkham origins and Arkham Asylum, but to be truthful I could have easily never played this and still felt like the games bridged by themselves. The story just doesn't link the games for me, and it made the overall frustration factor even worse because I might as well have not wasted my time.\n\nI honestly wouldn't recommend buying this game. If you get it free from a Bundle of the other Arkham games, then sure give it a play. But honestly, I regret buying this game.","March 6","false","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let's start with this: I wanted to like this game. I really did. I like the other Batman games, I played through Asylum and City multiple times before Games for Windows Live closed AND after that, on Steam, I liked the less-than-favorite Origins, and I'm one of the lucky few, who could play with Knight without serious problems and yes, I loved it. If it wouldn't be enough, I love Metroidvania games. Super Metroid, Symphony of the Night, Dust: An Elysian Tail, Ori and the Blind Forest, and the list goes on... So yes, I wanted this game to be good.\n\nSadly, it's not. The battle is bad - it's basically the same than the one in the other Batman games, except here isn't nearly as fluid and responsive, the map is a mess, but it doesnt matter, because you don't have to think too much, you can't get lost, you just need to go forward, which is disappointig after all those games I mentioned. And I don't know whose idea was that you have to scan everything but please, someone kick him for me, please... you can't aim with your gadgets, you can't jus blow that annoying wall away, you have to scan that freaking wall, and THEN use your explosive gel... yeah, that's reeeally exciting, isn't it?...\n\nI'm glad, that I did not pay for this game. I've got it because of the Arkham Knight fiasco, so it would be a horrible compensation for the bad experience with that game, IF I had any. Lucky me, I guess. But if you are like me, and you like the Batman games or the Metroidvania games, and you looking for something you didn't played yet AND you don't have this game... well, search for an another one. This one isn't worth your money, nor your time.\n_____________________________________________\n\nPS.: Oh, and if you see any mistake... please, do be a grammar nazi, english isn't my first language, and I want to learn from my mistakes :D Thanks!","January 20","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are largely unresponsive (I use a Microsoft Wired Xbox 360 Pad) and so you can be pressing the counter button with it not doing anything, and the mechanics of the game are very frustrating at times. The Map is a 3D mess that is over-complicated for the game. There are times when you literally have no idea where you are or how you got there. The Boss fights are either ridiculously easy or overly hard and the fact that the game ues check points is very frustrating on the bosses. You can beat the same bosses first couple of phases over and over again, but if you die then you have to redo the entire fight from the start (including any cut scenes) which just gets overly frustrating (particularly on the Penguin boss fight because his gaurds can seem to see you even when they have their back to you).\n\nThe controls are a mess too, and so sometimes you need to hold "A" to enter a vent, sometimes its Down + "A", sometimes the Right Trigger button or sometimes its Down + Right Trigger. When you are trying to escape an enemy with a gun, you can be pressing the buttons you usually press to get away, but this particular room might have a completely differnt set of buttons. It really is just a mess.\n\nThe combat is repetitive and boring too. You can start a combo on an enemy and rather than seeing different attacks, Batman just throws the same punch over and over again until the final blow (which does differ). It just feels really lacking compared the real Arkham Games.\n\nAnother thing which is overdone and frustrating is the constant back tracking. You need to enter each wing to get a piece of Bat-Tech for the next wings Puzzle, but then have to re-enter them to get the access codes and then re-enter each one again to fight the bosses. Finally you have to re-enter them yet again because you have to disarm some Bombs which have been placed right in the dead centre of each zone. In all honesty, this game would probably last an hour if you didn't have to back track so much. It's pretty clear to me that they have just added the back-tracking in to ensure the game has a longer play time, but for me it wasn't fun, it was very boring and very frustrating getting lost constantly.\n\nI have loved all of the Arkham games and DLC and even though this was a side scroller beat em up, I wanted to love it too but I just can't. I honestly have more fun playing an old 80's side scroller like Streets of Rage or Final Fight than I had during the several hours this took to complete.\n\nI feel bad leaving this review if I am honest, but I just can't say anything nice about this game.

However, the game design is unintuitive in various crucial moments. A lot of back tracking which is a bad idea in a 2,5 D environment. Cannot really recommend it for the price they're asking.","June 4","false","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
