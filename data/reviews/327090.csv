A bandit in bronze armor came, chopped through our doors in under a minute and killed us just as quick. 3 men with non-bronze armor  stood NO chance against 1 man in bronze armor. When the bandit learned that it would be 2 real life days before he could get any loot he left to go kill fresh spawns. We upgraded our doors to metal with what little bronze we could find but that only slowed him down alittle when he came back to kill us. Which he did easily.\n\nCons-Raiding requires that you capture and hold an enemy base for upto 72 real life hours before you get any loot for your efforts unless you destroy the builders desk.\n-Building isn't effected by gravity so you can build a base so high in the air it cannot be attacked with a treb. making raiding it impossible.\n-The boat requires spamming the Use buttons on both paddles so your boating experiance is you staring at paddles.\n-A man can burn your boat with a torch so if your out on your boat coming back to land and you see someone on the beach you MUST murder them or they may burn your boat.\n-Murdering people increases your fighting stats promoting Kill On Sight\n-Getting tired from sprinting plays an audio clip of a man thats out of breath but in the recording you can hear static and the recording itself cut off like it was recorded on a tape player.\n-Textures are rough and I get half the FPS that I do on Rust which looks far better.\n-On the servers that I played on the mines were mostly controlled by clans in bronze armor that killed anyone who got near the mine so getting ore was near impossible.\n-No server admins and the /report function didn't seem to do anything so expect the chat to be filled with racism/homophobic talk.\n-Until you level up your resource gathering is very slow.\n-Animal AI is laughable as I shoot a rhino and it runs around a few seconds before stopping like nothing happened. All animals can easily be out run and pose little threat. Hunting is nothing more than a grind to get the materials you need.\n-Plants (Such as flax) always grow in the same spot so experianced players farm it all out while noobs can never seem to find any.\n-Everyone spawns in on the same somewhat small island that cannot support the amount of players on it so lack of resources and starvation is common.\n-Doors provide little to no protection so expect to log into a base with no doors or bed because anyone with a rock can break through a wood door.\n-Healing is done by eating food and the healing is instant so if your fighting run away for a moment, eat some food and instantly be back at 100%. While being raided we shot the raiders with bows but they just hid behind a rock and healed so it quickly became boring.\n-There is no base decay so the landscape is littered with bases which decreases your FPS. I have been near large bases which tanked my FPS from 50 down to 10 so if you build a big base you will be penalized by a large FPS drop.\n\npros-You can burn stuff with a torch.","August 31, 2015","false","36.5"," 391 of 479 people (82%) found this review helpful 99 people found this review funny","82","391","479","99","27"

I'm happy to say I finally pulled the trigger on Out of Reach a couple of weeks ago, and believe I made a great decision. Good enough to write my first review anyways!\n\nI wanted to be sure I had the hang of the game, as I heard crafting menus were strange and certain combat aspects were glitchy. I joined a pretty low-key server at the bottom of the list just to be sure my sub-par "gaming" laptop could handle it. So far so good, and the low population server is great because I'm not pressured to defend myself, grind for competing resources, or worry about how well my base is constructed. Whether you view low player count as a positive or negative, I do feel pretty lonely when I'm 1/75 spots available...\n\nWith only 9.6 hours on record over the two week span (as of this review), I've progressed much further than I anticipated. Instead of constantly griding to survive, I've spent a good chunk of time crafting useful items, exploring, getting plowed by rhinos, and investigating some of the abandoned bases that those before me have left behind. Just the other day, the devs released gliders, which will allow you to fly around the map. I haven't had the chance to try it out, but it is nice to see notable updates already.\n\nIf you're looking for a great survival type game, this is it. I'm really excited to see what other features are released in the future, and hope I'm able to convince some fellow gamers to join in and populate these servers. There is so much potential to be shared, and I hope this has provided a bit of insight from a somewhat casual gamer's perspective.\n\nEDIT: I revised/removed my original (and unfair) comments comparing it to Day Z.","August 18, 2015","true","23.2"," 99 of 126 people (79%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","79","99","126","15","10"

It's still on alpha test, but surprisingly well polished for an early alpha though. You can craft tools, weapons and equipment from stone, bones, bronze & steel. It's an open world with caves and a few islands. You can travel in between islands by boat or swim to some of the islands. You can build a small cozy house, bigger base or even a castle if you determine enough. Make your own Tribe/Clan if you feel this way. Also, you can make your own garden to grow berries, flux fiber or wheat. Fishing is also been implemented. You can also find a pirate chests with some gold coins and wheat seeds inside as well.\n\nIf you into killing you'll need to get used to in game mechanics first. It's quite hard to get that bow skill, but you can master it in a few weeks.\nMostly people in game are friendly and there is no constant "killing on side".\nThe skills system is also under development, but already implemented.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game for anyone who likes survival games with a great community and no modern weapons.\nPlease consider though that this game is still under development, so you may discover a new bugs. However, developers are very quick on fixing the issues and you can see them on the server asking for what they can improve. Quite impressive if you ask me.\nOnly the official servers are available and plenty to chose from, from normal, to PvP and PvE. We never had wipes before, no random admins either.\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nЭто очень интересная survival игра. Она все еще на стадии альфа теста, но довольно отполирована для ранней альфы. Вы можете создать разнообразные инструменты, оружие и снаряжение  из камня, костей, бронзы или стали. Это открытый мир с пещерами и несколькими островами. Вы можете путешествовать на лодке или переплыть на некоторые из островов самостоятельно. Вы можете создать маленький уютный дом, базу или даже замок если у вас хватит терпения. Создайте свое племя/клан если вам так захочется. Так же, вы можете посеять свой огород с ягодами, льном или пшеницей. Рыбалку тоже уже сделали. Вы также можете найти пиратские сундуки с золотыми монетами и семенами пшеницы.\n\nЕсли вам больше по нраву убивать, то сначало вам надо привыкнуть к механике в игре. Это довольно сложно по началу, быть точным с луком, но практикуясь вы сможете отточить свой навык в течение пары недель.\nБольшинство народу в игре доброжелательные и нету частого kos, убийства при встрече.\nСистема навыков находится на стадии разработки, но уже присутствует в игре.\n\nВ целом, я рекомендую эту игру всем, кому по нраву survival жанр без современного оружия и с отличным комюнити.\nПожалуйста имейте ввиду, что игра еще в стадии разработки, так что возможно вы сможете обнаружить баги. Однако, разработчики очень отзывчивые и исправляют их в кратчайшие сроки (24 часа). Вы часто сможете увидеть их онлайн интересующихся тем, что они могут исправить или улучшить. Довольно удивительное явление если вы спросите меня.\n\nТолько официальные сервера доступны в настоящее время, от обычных до PvP и PvE. У нас не было еще вайпов или рандомных админов.","August 12, 2015","true","555.4"," 66 of 77 people (86%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","86","66","77","8","0"

Only 5 hours in and having a blast. It reminds me of rust legacy only with a much larger map and crafting system. There are pvp and pve servers up - not a lot of players but lots to do. First and third person view with a hidden map that reveals as you explore. Base building with upgrades and a "snap" system that let's you be creative! I found a huge underground cavern and was three levels deep when I decided to turn back for fear of death due to lack of food. I haven't hunted successfully yet but the animals seem to be running in herds and quite fast!

Just look at them... They are written by some dimwits who played the game for 0.1 hrs and refunded it.

It is more player-firendly than most other survival games. Here you can upgrade your builder's desk (the heart of your base) and prolong the defence time (during which you can simply reclaim all your stuff) up to 72 hrs.

So I lived as a wanderer, poaching deer and collecting berries out in the deserted areas during the day.

Great game for what I'm comparing it too that has it's own style.  Content still isn't fully there - need more animals, gear and some terrain additions for sure, but gameplay is very addictive.  I would call it a mix between ROK, LIF and Rust.  There are no sleepers which some of you may enjoy - when you log off your stuff own your body is safe.  It's nice but also a little lame after playing so many sleeper games.\n\nRaiding is interesting, you can break doors easy but can't loot boxes if the person has a building station which you have to destroy and then wait for a time to expire (3 hrs+) before you can look the boxes.  I thought this was really lame at first but it adds a new dimension of exploring, finding a raided base full of loot and you didn't do the raiding.  It's like finding buried treasure.\n\nI will keep playing for a while, seems a bit too easy at the moment.  I have about 15 hours in and can get full bronze equip, boat, etc.  I raid and kill people pretty easily but have also gotten killed.\n\nNot sure when people were saying there isn't much KOS because I was KOSed so much the first day that I'm playing it like Rust now - kill first and ask questions later.\n\nHope you join us because it really needs more players.  Servers seem to max out at about 20 players at some point in the day right now and even though it's decent, we could use more.\n\nOh I forgot to mention fires!  When someones building permissions expire you can set their base on fire and burn it down.  This is lovely to watch and works great for cleaning up the abandoned buildings.\n\nWhen you first start, look for an abandoned base that already has a furnace and an anvil.  Put your own building station in and add some doors and it will be your base.  This is what I did on my first play through and it helped speed things up alot because those tools were already there for me.\n\nGet it while it's on sale because it's worth $12 if you like survival games.","August 21, 2015","true","141.0"," 42 of 50 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","42","50","4","0"

The game is very addictive!\nThis game is not the easiest and you are never completely safe even if you do have a strong base, every time you go out to get some ore you are at risk because there is nothing in the game that will make you unkillable.\nIt takes some time to get the gear going and in my opinion thats a great thing because people cant just craft good gear in a matter of 20 minutes and go and kill people like in allot of these so called "survival" games (*cough* Rust *cough cough*).\n\nThere is a fair amount of content in the game right now there are gazelles, zebras, rhinos, hippos, tigers and crocodiles for wildlife and you can hunt these animals to get food and other materials. They will of course be adding more wildlife as updates roll in because that would make sense. As for crafting there is enough to keep you going back to the caves for ores but the crafting could use some more items.\nBugs and glitches are to be expected but i havent really noticed anything major.\n\nOverall i will actually recommend this game already!\n","June 11, 2015","true","88.8"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","0"

Annoying, things out of the way. Yes, i do understand the game is still an early access and yes they do have a long way to go, but the devs are juggling a lot right now, trying to get the optimization just right and fixing bugs as well as adding new content. Although they do seem to skip over some stuff like arrows glitching and such. but most of the stuff that is Wrong is very minor, thank god it isn't major otherwise i wouldn't have played for as long as i have. As of right now the Game has a Cap, there is no goal that is "Out of Reach", if you knew what you were doing you could probably have full bronze equipment in a few hours. The player base is Very small therefore making it hard to enjoy with others seeing as how they have a HUGE server list making it to where the players can go to different servers starting anew on each one. the only real downside i see to that is that the game isn't popular enough for them to need that many servers. The servers can become very...Cluttered, as well. many of the people who buy the game then quit leave their stuff behind, I.e. Buildings that have been claimed and cant be gotten rid of. so it does cause some frame issues when you have a lot of buildings to register on your screen. again not major stuff just minor irritants.\n\nNow time for the stuff I do like a lot about the game. I myself and some of the other people i happen to play with are very friendly, now im not gonna say everyone is because this game is a survival and fighting is part of the learning process. the game has a very easy crafting system and building is fun and easy as well. you can do a lot in the game. even with a "Cap" on what you can do. i still have fun by just going hunting or talking with the other players. you dont have to fight but its a good way to enjoy the game and if you can find enough people to enjoy it with, there is even a clan system so you can set a base and work your way from there. the bugs are very minor and hardly noticeable unless you go looking for them, and when they do happen you can simply log out and log back in to reset your connection to the server. this game is very fun and i still have a blast fighting players with the same set of skills as me, they recently added farming and they plan to expand that even more, the Devs work hard and i applaud them for their efforts they are very consistent with keeping the players informed and are always providing responses fairly quickly for players having issues with the game.\n\nIts not a lot about the game, just some key subjects but its on its way to becoming better than what it started as. my only suggestions are adding extra items to the game, such as better weapons and armor crafting. but if you want something to kill time and people with a satisfactory hut or fort or tower to lay your head at then this game is for you. Recommend it to your friends, start a clan, fight the raiders or be the raiders.\n\nHonestly a damn good survival 10/10","July 24, 2015","true","575.5"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","23","25","0","0"

Most developers will over promise and under provide but my experience with the developers of OOR are quite the opposite. There is balance that will push the player to think outside of the box and use the community to further their rise to power. It also serves to keep players from being "godly" as an unstoppable force of destruction, raining terror on all the newcomers.\n\nThis game is a hidden gem in a genre that has a reputation of letting players down. I've never seen hackers that plague other games and thorough enjoy a spot in a lead clan and being hunted as an unknown on another server.

Base Building is excellent, and the builder's desk allows you to really protect your base against griefers, even if you stayed off the game for more than a day. The downside to this being that some bases will require multiple days and raids before you can really get anything from them. Player interaction is a lot of fun. Since there aren't any guns and the only weapon capable of instantly killing someone is stationary, you'll never get sniped in 1 shot from a distance (though arrows can hurt from a respectable range) meaning players aren't as likely to outright attack you, and if they do, in most cases you can put up a fight or even outrun them, if they're wearing heavy armor. This allows for a much more cooperative atmosphere where players are more likely to band together, rather than constantly trying to kill each other. As for the atmosphere, the game is very visually pleasing (even on lower settings), and the environment looks amazing as you explore the island's different areas. Honestly the only bad thing I have to say about this game is the lack of players.

(PvE you can't steal peoples stuff or injure them.)\n- Good graphics and combat for an early access game.\n- Using the Bow is fun and difficult; the further you get from your target the higher you must aim.\n- Lots of craftable items and building parts with more to come.\n- A Map (press m) to find your friends or to know where you are. (What you explored is what you see.)\n- Creepy Caves to explore.\n- Swimming kills stamina which eventually can end bad if you wander, or in this case, swim too far.\n- Many Islands to explore.\n- Build forts, castles or shacks and defend them!\n- Collecting and mining system works a bit differently than in other games; as you mine, gather or chop you collect during the process. (Example: Each axe hit will give you +1,+2,+3  wood until the tree falls.)\n- Character skill and leveling up system. The more you use your skills the better you become. Auto level up. (Think of Oblivion or Skyrim, but very simplified.)\n- Easy to find a decent server.\n\nQuestionable features:\n\n- Need more animals (potentially bugs and ocean life), plants, recipies, and stuff to collect but the amount there is so far is actually very decent for an early access survival game.\n- Building can be annoying if you are not used to how it works. Trail and error.\n- Tearing down structures can be tedious.\n- A lot of open water. There is no point in exploring the corners or sides of the map.\n- The animal AI is dumb at the moment. (That's good news for all you people who like to hunt without much of a challenge.)\n- No thirst system.\n- Falling trees can't hurt you. :P\n- The boat works but can be annoying to use without a buddy. (I got dizzy exploring all 4 corners of the map...And to know it was all for nothing...)\n- In PvE servers you don't have to worry about being looted or returning to the server only to find your fort destroyed or stolen. That being said, there are no threats other than some peaceful animal predators. Maybe this is why there aren't many PvE servers.\n\nOverall I recommend this game for all you folks who enjoy multiplayer survival games, frequent updates, collecting/exploring, crafting, and building. It is an impressive early access title.\n\nSurvival Rating: 7.8/10","August 24, 2015","true","33.1"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Running it on my laptop seems to have no problems.  Where as Rust and the Forest seem to still have issues every now and then.  The game is definitely interesting because of the fact that you can build anywhere (That has its pros and cons; if you continue reading some of the reviews someone points out the cons.)   But a key thing to remember about the game is that its only fairly new, so content in the matter of gear and balancing gear is very far off.  I am curious as to where they are going to take the game.   Because right now they could even take it to a mythological point.  Just by looking at what is in the game, the developers could add in Dragons, Sea-Serpeants, Sphinxs, and other things like that (you know as like end game type of mobs), as a potential end game set for players who spend alot of time playing.\n\nSo my actual review.\n\nPros: Respawning Resources unlike The Forest or Rust.  The trees in this game respawn, so you do not have to worry about coming into a new server and worrying about "Well will I have materials to make a base."\nThe base foundation for the game is well done, gardening is done well.  You can grow food and not have to worry about having to hunt for food all the time, afk fish (fish traps), or if you want to hunt, with the skill leveling you can get more food as you hunt more.\nThere is a level system and skills.  Killer, Hunter, Gatherer, Smith, Logger, Miner.   Only two kills at the moment; Charge (Faster Running) and Better Aim.\n\n\nCons: I have noticed while I was trying to find friends, you generally spawn in the same areas.  Unless you have a bed down.  Because of spawning in the same areas you have the potential to spawn inside of a players prebuilt base.  Worse case senario that guy built he base so that new players can't get out.\nAs of right now since the game is new, you run out of things to do after a few hours of play, unless you continue to upgrade your base.\n\nOverall I am very statified with the game for being very new and being able to run on my laptop and desktop very well.\n\n(PS game devs: if you actually take the time to read this and decide that adding in dragons and what not; do not add in magic, magic abilities are generally game breaking.  Dragon Armor; Sphinx Treasure, Sea-Serpeant weapons.  Make the game more Melee or Range.  I don't think this type of game will be fair if you add in magic because of the fact that some spells will be impossible to truely nerf.  But if you really want to add some spells like Magical Door Barrier (only breakable after Many hits with a terbuchet, than add it into the drop tables for The mythical creatures...

Still keep the boats to get to the other islands for first time\n3. Ability to create a fire pit with a top to protect it from the rain and brighter campfire\n4. Keep improving the game and graphics .

It's lack luster.\n\nPros\n- Runs decently\n- Devs seem to be active with the community\n- Good building system\n\nCons\n- Animation rigging is horrible, looks like things are gliding across the world.\n- Camera stuttering. Despite running at 60-80FPS all the time, camera felt clunky and seemed like it almost had a stutter. If you get motion sickness easily from first person games, stay away until they get it fixed. I don't have this problem with 7 Days to Die or Rust.\n- Reticle doesn't match up with character swings. You have to hug any resource to harvest it. Despite you being close and your reticle being on it. Definitely does not favor melee.\n- Static Spawns for resources\n- They said they had the audio redone, but as far as I can tell, it's still pretty awful. It all sounds like it was passed through some sort of robot filter.\n- No hit feedback from being attacked. You screen just flashes red and your health bar goes down. Reminds me of really old school FPS's.\n- Wind sound, but there's no wind blowing on the island?\n\nProgrammers / Developers that have worked in Unity will know when playing this how basic feeling this game is.\nI feel they might have gotten carried away with late game already, without things being unfinished.\nReminds me of something Dunkey said in one of his videos where he says that game developers now a days want to go out and add every single feature from every single game they've ever seen without finishing the core game. They're making a pizza, but there's no cheese on there. So they add all of these toppings and you just have this abomination that no one wants to eat.\n\nI'll probably play more when it gets updated and feels smoother, but right now it feels clunky and gives me a headache. :/","December 28, 2015","false","0.7"," 104 of 179 people (58%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","58","104","179","17","6"

I wear glasses, and am nearly blind without them, and get less "flaring" while outside on a sunny day. C'mon, lens flares were popular on consoles 10 years ago.\n\nHow this isn't an alpha is beyond me.\n\nMovement.... Well let's just say... It could use more than a bit of improvement. Run in a straight line and you're ok. Try to "strafe" even in the smallest iota, and you go from a jog to what seems to be a stumble. Dunno about the rest of the human race, but even as an overweight 35yr old dad of 2, I can still run sideways at a decent speed.\n\nGathering. God help you if you want to gather anything outside of stone and wood. If you are lucky and find flax, berries, or corn; then you have won the damn lottery. Fishing seems to be the best way to gather food, as you just need wood to make a net. If you get seeds while gathering a plant, you are fairly lucky. After traversing around 50% of the map, I have found 8 flax plants..... 1 seed.... Really.... 1 seed....\n\nSwimming. This is one of the worst mechanics in the game. Hands down. Try and swim for more than 10-15 seconds, and you start to die. Why? No ♥♥♥♥ing clue. Hypothermia? Sharks? Aliens? Who knows.\n\nCrafting. While I like the crafting for buildings, crafting anything else is nails on a chalkboard. Clunky UI, bad tooltips, crap instructions, etc...\n\nLast really big gripe is the servers. 5 pve servers, the rest are pvp mixed. between that , and the fact that the servers are clutterred with crap building all over the place, you really can't enjoy just building. Even if you want to PvP, good luck. Being a noob on a pvp server where resources are nigh on impossible to obtain, is nothing more than a campfest for those who were early arrivers.\n\nLast note, having a logout timer is ok for pvp, but on a pve server, dumb as hell.\n\n\nWould I buy the game again? no. Not for more than $5\nCan I get my money back? Nope, left the game running while afk dealing with my kids and went over the 2 hr mark.\nShould you get this game? No. Get something more supported and fun, like Reign of Kings.\n\ntl:dr\nNo, just no.","November 4, 2015","false","2.3"," 41 of 66 people (62%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","62","41","66","12","0"

I have only played alone on a server so far, but being a loner, that suits me quite perfectly ;)\n\nSo I had managed to mine enough tin + copper ( = bronze in the furnace) to make a pickaxe head. Well, so I thought, until I found out that I needed more bronze for an anvil to refine the pickaxe head before I could assemble it. The anvil needed more bronze, so another trip to the cave, deeper into it this time, and back to build the anvil. But I soon found out that laying the raw pickaxe head on the anvil and hammering it with my stone axe was futile. I needed more bronze to make a special hammer for the anvil. This time I had to search even deeper into the cave until I had enough tin and copper. I ran back in the direction of the cave entrance. But suddenly I was falling down!\n\nI must have turned wrong direction somewhere. Images from my short OOR-life were flickering through my mind while I was falling, until I brutally and painfully landed on some stalagmites at the bottom. But I was still alive, though barely! Luckily I had brought enough red berries with me to heal myself almost fully up. I had also brought one extra torch into the cave, but had been forced to lit it in the middle of my last mining. I didn't know how long that one would last. At least my stomach was filled up due to the red berries. I started to walk. After a while I saw light in front of me. Really? There was a lower entrance into the cave system? But, the entrance was covered with planks, and the daylight only shined through the openings between them. I tried to axe my way out for a minute, but with no luck.\n\nShort-sighted as I was, I had forgot to put away my torch when hammering on the planks. I decided to do a last search for another entrance in the cave system while I still had light in my torch. After a bit running here and there, I seemed to achieve nothing. The torch only threw a dim light on the cold cave walls, and I started to panic and think that I would die deep inside the cold mountain. Without the torch I would see nothing at all. It would become pitch black. When I almost had lost all hope, I suddenly found a way that went upwards. And upwards! And upwards, until it flattened out. But which direction should I run? I tried to run in one direction, but it felt wrong. I turned the other way and ran back. I had lost valuable torch-time, and now there was no more time to lose if I should ever make it out of the caves. I ran and ran, chose directions at intersections at random, and suddenly I vaguely saw a very dim light in front of me. Shortly after I ran out of the cave-system through another opening than the one I went into.\n\nAnd the torch went out!","June 15, 2015","true","19.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","1"

Such as the ability to make a cargo cruiser, or a warship with several crossbows.\n\nThe weaponry and tool base is cool and it has a fairly realistic structure for making metal based objects. Create item in forge, put on anvil and smack with hammer, go to tool table to put tool head onto tool body. Although more weaponry such as blunderbusses, or items such as a war ax or mace just more weaponry in general but it is still early access.\n\nThe resource collection system is wonderful as it is not too grindy but still takes effort to harvest trees, stone, and ore. Maybe add more ores for more tools and so bronze (or copper which ever one is an alloy I always forget) so it is not the main resource.\n\nThe building system is wonderful as it allows full building almost anywhere and you can build it how you want. Not much else to ask for here but maybe adding more buildables but i'm happy with the buildables currently.\n\nThe salvage system is balanced in every way and theirs a balanced XP system the more you use a skill the better it gets but maybe add ranged weapons and melee weapons skill.\n\nSumming up suggestion basically: More content, skills, animals, weapons, tool, transportation stuff (I.E. boats), and maybe more buildables. Add more ores and more boat customization are my major ones. ALSO PLEASE ADD NORMAL FINISHING ;)\n\ngame is 8/10\n\nGreat Graphics\nCompetent skill system\nDecent combat system\nGreat bow system you actually have to aim by how far away said creature is\nGreat drop tables\nFairly good animal AI but why don't they chase you into the water?","June 1","true","48.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Normally, I wouldn't trust a review with so little time played. But let me tell you my first experieces in this game:\n\nWake up on a beach. Wtf man how'd I get here? I'm holding a rock so I go knock some trees and rocks and get some stuff. I notice a boat nearby, obviously human built. I say fuggit and take it for a joyride to another island right off the bat. As I get there, another player flags me down.\n\nI follow him. He shows me how to hunt, how to build. how to survive. I ask him why he's helping me. He said because winter is coming.\n\nOnly issue is low server population, but it's kind of nice bc you can explore and raid.

I have played it a lot and its a great game to play with friends. What would really make this game is if it had a better crafting system the one right now works just fine and is functional but gets a little boring after a while and you tend to spend too much time gathering resources for your base. there is a mode that makes it easier and faster to get them but its focus is on killing not so much the building part. also the animals are kinda sad they look good and can do their job well but they lack the animal feel they are to much like a robot to me not because of how they move but were they go when they stop and they always come back to the same place its very predictable and not as natural as it should be.

The button clicks from the menu and most of the ambient noise is coming through my rear 2 surround speakers and is throwing me off a bit because I had no clue what those clicking noises were until I put 2-and-2 together. Also with the breathing noises and pretty much every other recorded bit of audio, the static-y beginning and end of each audio clip can be heard. If it were subtle things I wouldn't point them out but they're brazenly obvious so I'm just giving you (the dev mostly) a heads up that you may wanna tweak your audio a tad.\n\nOverall though, the gameplay felt nice. Obviously didn't play it for very long but the movement was good, animations were decent for pre-alpha and most likely self-rendered so bravo on that.\n\nTo be honest, I feel the game is probably worth about half of what it goes for currently. The game looks, feels and sounds like a very well enhanced survival game developed in the mid 2000's. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it's just that just because there's an overwhelmingly large amount of things to see and do, it doesn't mean said stuff is all that pretty (again, not a bad thing especially at this state). But granted, this is an Early Access game so you guys definitely have time to spruce up a lot of that stuff pre-launch while tending to the more intricate gameplay matters.\n\nI'm reccomending this for the future versions of the game. I can tell where this game wants to end up and I can tell the dev team wants to get it there and it's only been in Early Access for two weeks.\n\nI'm excited to see how things look and feel in the next 3 or 4 months.

That's really all there is left anymore...a few players. Also, bulding has some rough edges, although it's overall a fun building experience. Gathering is a rather tedious part of the game, whether thats hunting, logging, etc.\n\nHowever, I think the largest problem with OOR is players not wanting to take the leap from Surviving to Seiging. The game could really use more advanced clan support. Such as the ability to communicate more effectively to your clan, or even offline messaging to show your hold is being seiged. Also, some sort of clan scoring system might be nice. Other than the same old loot, what are we fighting for again? There's not much motivation to work together, outside of pairing to survive random pks. If the developers are hoping people form clans that stick around, provide a setting that makes it fun and worthwhile. Give me a reason, as a survivor, to band up with people and fight.\n\nAside from a few other hostile players, its not hard to survive...at all. The environment poses very little challenge, other than your ability to collect tons of materials to build the simplest things. It's essentially a materials chase, but there is no ticking clock. You wont get cold, and hunger is fairly easy to overcome. Items degrade, and that's about it.\n\nMelee combat is as basic as it comes, including pvp. Connecting a blow isn't satisfying at all. The only thing that is satisfying about pvp combat is the loss (in materials) your opposition will face. Speed matters sometimes, as armor can slow you down. Ranged combat is somewhat more interesting and fun. Is this skill-based? Not at all, although a good ping will likely help you along the way.\n\nHFGL\n","April 25","false","73.7"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

Only about once every week, and even then it only lasts about 30 seconds at most. Game speed: pc gamers are spoiled.

That was so cool.\n\n> Walked up some steep hill and found a building.  Rather mundane, rectangular, wood, and the wood looked reinforced, so a busy beaver was the owner I suspected.\n\n> Walked up to the door and my cursor turned into a "hand", i figured cool open the door.  No go, instead it seems i bang on the door with my rock.  Ok, i try it again, oops banged on the door again.  So i figure that isn't very nice to do and turn and begin walking away.  That is when the door opened and the chase began.  Why did i run?  Because the person opening the door could have said "Who is it?" when my rock went "knock knock", so i figured it was probably smart to be flight of foot at that moment - always trust your instincts.\n\n>  Arrows fly - i hear the twang of the bow, so i go for the steepest area of the big hill i am on and leap down the mountain running full out, or as they said in the 70's "booking it".  The arrows do not stop.  Nor do i make any sort of move to look over my shoulder.  I learned in track that looking over your shoulder slows you down - not a good idea when running for your life.\n\n>  I get to the top of the next hill and the arrows have stopped and then the assailer / home owner says: "Next time i won't miss, Briana".\n\n>  I didn't stop running for a while until i could barely stand.

Of course as more information comes out we will see this game advance fairly quick. I have to make a few points of which impressed me the most about the game!\n\n1:The graphics are truly spended, once you submerge yourself into the island life you will see that very quickly you will become apart of the game. Unlike Ark, I don't have to worry at all about my FPS at any time and my distance is max! The ocean and sky could use some more art but other then that the islands look perfect and the wildlife that follow too!\n\n2:You're not a god and cannot run forever to escape a fight. This game does rely on some type of a tactic, you can attack front on or keep your distance; but it will run out sooner then you think. The stamina system is great because it cannot recharge super fast for anyone to do a hit n' run tactic instead short burst are what will determine life or death. The charge button works great for a shielded enemy if you are a archer to run up and cut you down but similarly a bowman can get distance enough for 1 shot. I prefer the bow to most attacks due to (my personal) skill with the bow.\n\n3:The community is slowly going to KOS on sight, not to bad and most people are willing to help you or at least give you something. Don't expect many people to be so nice, especially in groups! Normally they are looking for someone or... You if you're unlucky..\n\nNow of course there is some bad...\n\n1:Renegade system needs to be improved (A LOT) because if you get attacked by someone who is neutral even if they hit you first, the moment you attack them back you are considered to be a bandit. The game doesn't register it correctly and the only way you won't get it is if you attack someone with a red name (Majority of the red names were protecting themselves from KOSing people). I already encountered many noobs thinking it would be a good idea to attack me because I am red... Doesn't work that way.. :D\n\n2:Sounds, something that seriously needs to be looked into is the sound system in the game. Many of the animals make noises but aren't really correct. I mean the Zebra sounds like a damn hyenna most of the time which at the begenning of the game will completely throw you off. Same with many of them, but most seriously is when someone is talking it sounds like they are in a toilet and there getting flushed! You'll learn this as you go...\n\n3:More stuff!!! This will come in time but at the moment there is a lot but once you get ahang of things its pretty easy to get supplies and craft whatever is needed. Its a grinder game but with a lot of mixed feeling, you'll want to becareful of loosing everything but at the same time you will need to get more supplies. Overall, base building is safe 90% of the time but if you're not careful and protect it someone can lay down a fire to burn you alive.\n\n4:Finally, the AI... Most of the animals are so stupid compared to what they would be like in other games. They simply respawn exactly where you kill them and its almost like farming animals. Once you get yourself ontop of something they cannot kill you and will run back. During this time you can kill it..\n\nOverall, 7.5/10 improvement is always coming but for now it deserves more players and funding...","August 28, 2015","true","64.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Fun medevil weaponry. Not to buggy.\nIf you enjoy survival games at all, this game is worth a try.\nThe ui and stuff is not very polished, but it does'nt effect the game that much. Character animations could use some work I guess. Overall the fun for me in the game is just farming resources, building your base, then working on ways to defend it from people. There is some pretty solid weapon/gear progression so far. First you can make stone weapons, and leather armor, then use bone you harvest from animals to make better weapons, and upgrade your leather armor. Then you start farming copper to make bronze, from there you make bronze armor, tools, and weapons. After that you can start farming iron to make steel, but it rare and takes awhile to travel to "iron island" to find it.","September 7, 2015","true","70.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I would like to share some thoughts with you on this brand new survival journey game called Out Of Reach.\nWhen you start to play it you starve... you loose your sense of direction... you run and run and feel very lonely at night.\nThen when you are very close to death and when it looks to your eyes and Steam is whispering about another games you could play you find first blue berry.

Gathering of resources is getting pace and you start to learn how to hunt and build a shelter.\nWhen everything is going to be just fine and sun is shining you find that somehow you've been robbed! Damn it! You are not alone.

I bought it on sale so I decided to jump on it. After watching some youtube videos, I knew a lot on how to play it. The grind for materials is big. I enjoy it since then I would never get bored. Caves and mountains are the only places for minerals (Caves are dark! Take a torch). There is one island that has steel so you have to build a boat and explore. The level system and achievements have you striving for a goal. The different animals are great. Elephants, Rhinos, and Hippos will warn before they charge you. Boats and Gliders for easy travel. Rain, thunder, and lightning (doesn't touch the ground yet). Though I haven't done any PvP yet, just using the bow on animals shows the PvP will need work. There is treasure you need to find since you need gold coins to upgrade certain items. This game has been released for a year, it wouldn't be fair to compare this game to today's Rust or today's Ark. If you don't enjoy games that have early access flaws, this isn't the game for you. Most negative reviews are from people who are used to EA games YEARS into development or those that didn't read the dev's instructions on how to avoid crashes. Those games are smoother and clean. You're not going to get that with a game that literally released almost a year ago. This game has a lot of potentional and the dev's are active. Updates are constant. Use 2 hours and give it a shot. I absolutely love this game.","June 3","true","21.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I wanted to give this a full 24 hours to make sure it was a sufficient fix, and that it seemed to last, before updating my review.\n\nAs of this change, and having given it time to settle in, it seems that this issue has been resolved.  Connecting is smooth, still a little painful, it can take a few minutes to connect to the game even with a high-speed connection, but you expect issues like that with an Early Access game.  The rest of the review is still applicable.  I am now enjoying the game, though, instead of having a useless game in my library.  :)\n\n\nOriginal 8/25  This game required port forwarding to play, and once you have set up port forwarding, there is a more than small chance that you will still be unable to connect to their servers.  They are unhelpful about this issue on the forums, seeming unconcerned once they have your money, because you will spend so much time trying to connect to the servers (which counts as playtime), that Steam will reject your refund request.\n\nThat being said, this game has potential.  I would describe it as a low-budget version of Ark.  The mechanics and gameplay are very similar, but the attention to detail and graphics are lacking.  It's nice to have a game that doesn't require an i7 processor, but at the same time, some character customization (like being able to choose male or female) and fixes for what's in the game, instead of new half-completed content, would be nice.","August 25, 2015","true","135.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

I have noticed that certain servers do lag potentially where you are from.\n\n- A lot of stuff to do the Change in time was frustrating at first, but the community spoke and the Devs listened. The game has great changes.\n\n- Good community so far the addition of PVE servers makes it even better it gives you time to experience the game without the frustration of getting slaughtered by higher level or more experienced players.\n\n-Great graphics for an Alpha with any official game release I expect improvements to the graphics.\n\n-Building Mechanics are really easy. I enjoy the skills attached to this and how less items are required the more you work the skill. Adds replay value to the game.\n\nCons:\n- Too many servers the player base is too split up. With a Smaller Player base we need maybe 10 total servers.\n\n- Non PVE servers can be frustrating starting but that can be said for any PVP game you are new to.\n\n\n- As for negative reviews please remember the time they spent playing the game was limited.

Once you start it's really easy to sink in and forget about world around you :) Game does not guide you step by step so it's really fun to discover new things/new crafting combinations.

Maybe just because this one has no fire weapons (but various melee and range weapons), no explosives (but trebuchets), no cars (but boats and glidders).\n\nThe map is well thought with a lot of places to build in various ways, UI is working well, not any breaking game bugs, well optimized, good mechanics, developpers are active on the forum (and it seems they are working in a very professional way) and updates are regulary without any server wipes.\n\nOn standart servers (in addition to PVP servers and PVE servers), even if you are raided, you have a time protection (up to 3 days) which enables you to retake your base without loosing everything. So, if you can't play all day long you still have possibility to have fun in PVP environment.\n\nOf course we can wait for more items to build and a better AI for animals, but we can't reproach that at that point of development. I didn't want to invest more time in a MMO, but this one get me.\nTo make your own objective point of view, just watch http://steamcommunity.com/app/327090/discussions/0/485622866448222524/\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=665775487\n\nJérôme\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nFR\nTraduction Française du jeu quasi intégrale et plutôt réussie, complète.\nCarte bien pensée, avec nombreuses possibilités de construire avec diversité, l'interface est simple, agréable, aucun bug majeur, bien optimisé, mécaniques de craft logiques et expliquées, développeurs actifs sur le forum, MAJ régulières sans jamais aucun wipe.\n\nServeurs Standarts (en complément de PVE et de PVP) permettent d'avoir une protection allant jusqu'à 3 jours si jamais votre Builder Desk était détruit.

I started during nighttime, I didn't see much. After wandering aimlessly for a minute or two, I got a brilliant idea - “let’s gather some resources!” - because that’s what this games are about, right? After hitting the tree with a rock for several second, I figured out that this world doesn’t work like that. What I missed was that I actually gathered some wood, but it wasn’t too important, as I drowned while trying to reach the wreck.\n\nThis is not as complicated as it seemed to me at first. The tools for crafting are fairly simple, and gathering makes sense. To me, this looks like a first person Settlers game, at least on PvE sever. There are some nifty tools to protect from griefing, so nobody can wreck your constructions or steal your boat.\n\nFrom what I understand, it have some PvP potential, including sieges. It’s good, because this game have three different servers to choose from, so everyone should be able to find an appropriate kind.\n\nSo far, the game is extra stable and I was disconnected only because I needed to forward few ports (the game told me wat to do after being disconnected). No crashes caused by engine, no random fps drops, zero lags. This looks like a perfect spot to add a ♥♥♥♥-ton of new content. These are a fine foundations and besides improving the response to taking damage, I don’t see other major problems.\n\nI think I will craft myself a spear and try hunting other players on a PvP server.","December 13, 2015","true","39.6"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","5"

I found food almost immediately and it took me less than five minutes to gather necessary materials for a spear. While hunting animals seems like it would be difficult, staying alive is not.

It's not nearly as cartoony especially with no character creation currently in the game.

LOVE THE SMOOTHNESS. makes me feel like im playing a blizzard game.\n\nideal fixes\n\n- only two tiers of bows... a crossbow would be nice, then you can make it with wood, flax, and steel.(steel arrows)\n\n- torches, fire, and moon light are not very realistic, real life is brighter then this(not a big deal).  but would like to see a oil lamp(fat). maybe a torch mount for the boat.\n\n- no steel pickaxe or atlest a iron one\n\n- too much tree cutting!!!!!!!! lets move it to 500% for trees on pvp. this alone is going to make me leave. i like cutting trees but damn!!! all i do in this game is cut trees.\n\n- bone tools/weapons... i think are a waste of data.\n\n- too much tin, i mean way too much. i only need 200 tin to make 2000 bronze. but i have 1000 tin in 10 hours, worthless crap tha has one use.\n\n- on that note, stone! not many uses either. its ok though long as my game dont lag.\n\n- the copper to iron ratio on iron island is way too much for this island to be call iron island, needs to be call copper island. need to make it harder to make a boat on iron island, so lets remove some copper. saves data room for a smoother game. we DONT need more iron just less copper to fool me.\nalso i would love it, if the iron cave didnt have copper at all. spawn copper on the island but dont waste our time in the dark looking for iron and we find over 2000 copper in one cave expolration and only 200 iron.\n\n- steam boat needs one more upgrade.... a steel furnace so i can put more then a small amount of wood in it so it will go longer. maybe that oil lamp can be part of the upgrade to bigger furnaces too.\n\n- players can block up the iron caves in pve that way no one gets in, and you cant pilage and burn the place down. so if the person is a jerk, they can block the cave on a server forever.\n\n- no iron tools/weapons/armor...why we skipping the iron age(the greatest age, the age that made more and did more then any age before steel.)and going stright into steel? we are castaways on a pacific island, steel is a 100 times harder to smelt, in real life you wouldnt be able to smelt steel in a little wood furnace, it would also take a lot of energy. steel shouldnt even be on the list of stuff you can make on a castaway island(like steel but need make a realistic way to smelt it. replace the bone tools for iron. we can use extra bones to build fast armor in pvp. this will make it easier to get on full server and really try to survive.\n\n- new energy for steel smelting or a bigger wood furnace so its realistic.(turn wood to charcoal for a higher energy smelt for steel.\n\nthis to me,  is all a problem. this could make the normal person hate this game when you decide to drop it for xbox or ps","January 26","true","67.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And I was not disappointed. Graphics looked improved, buildings looked better. The world felt more inhabitated (especially after being hunted down and killed three times by a superior griefing enemy...). Server population was not too bad. Animals looked better and their behavior looked more realistic. I found the user interface more intuitve and user friendly now, and game was much more fun. Resource gathering was more entertaining, and building and crafting processes were more understandable and worked better. I will definitely return to this game in the near future now - it is absolutely worth playing in it's current state.\n\nConclusion: So I am changing my recommendation - now I recommend this game to people who enjoy games with themes such as survival, crafting, building and resource gathering.\n\n*****************************************************************\n\nOriginal review: Such a disappointment. I am sad I could not get a refund. The world seemed empty and hollow. Graphics were not pleasing to the eye. The buildings placed by other players were not pretty and looked unrealistic. There were few players logged on in the servers. The user interface was not especially user friendly and felt a bit hard to navigate. The animals behaved buggy and strange. Game was, in my opinion, boring and not engaging. Compared to the other survival/crafting games I love, the resource gathering was less fun and not so addictive as in other games. I can't recommend it in it's current state.","February 2","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

Nice vast, open world. I really got into hunting using bow. At first it seemed impossible, but after spending some time practicing I got to rather constantly succeed using minimal amount of arrows. Items upgrading is nice. I didn't get to spend too much time on constructing buildings but even then (beta) it seemed as a mature enough feature.\n\nI hope the game gets more players. Running alone all the time can get little bit boring. I'd really like gameplay experience like in the TV series "Lost" let's say one group stays near it's camp fire at night and the other can attack them in night, out of the shadows. Something like that.\n\nAnyway, nice project and keep up the good work devs!","November 4, 2015","true","10.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I love survival, building games (minus minecraft.. can't get past the 8-bit resolution of it lol) Anyway, the mechanics of building are very similar to early rust alpha. The play and graphics seem more similar to that of ARK, with a bit of Reign of Kings action.. Which is a really awesome concept for a game! Only thing wrong was the population.. There were only a couple of servers with more than one person on them. The screen was also in a weird format. This game has a lot of potential, I mean A LOT of potential, to be an amazing game. I do recommend trying it, I will be following it some more, and possibly redownloading this game in the future. As of now, I'm sorry, but I had to refund it =\\n\nAll-in-all, a great game with loads of potential. Remember, if you buy it, it's in early alpha. It's brand new, there are some minor things wrong with the game, but it seems as though the Dev's actually care about this one. Unlike Gary, who created Gary's Mod and Rust, just adding more features and not fixing the ones that are wrong.","October 16, 2015","true","0.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Now from that point not all game need to be visually appealing like actually there is another survival similar to this but its set in a  city and it is really fun if you guys haven't worked it out yet I mean 7 Days 2 Die that games was actually really fun with its Unique building style and just overall was pretty well done.\nThe point of this being an Indie game leads me to my next point that most people would say. Oh go easy on the guy its an Indie game, now in some cases this is a really good Idea and yes this game as an indie is actually really nice :) Like i don't know many survival games that had the guts try and go realistic like look at Unturned they chose an art style that wasn't meant to look realistic as of not to stuff it up But I think its actually good that the game dev tried to do this and who knows eventually it might be even better.\n\nAnother thing i don't really like is the building/wood cutting etc. In this game to collect wood you just need to smack a tree and you get 1x and a chance at more every time you hit I am not sure if other stuff effects this due to the short period of time I played since it was really late, but I just didn't think it was need, Yes some form of harvesting method was needed and maybe it wasn't your top priority but I just didn't feel like it matched with the game.\n\nOverall I personally wanna give this game a 4/10 but I still think this game could be better just not for $15.","December 30, 2015","true","0.1"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

I love survival sandbox games so I gave it a try. Boy was I wrong. I am a huge Rust player (540h) so I know what a decent game in this genre should be like and this game FAILS HARD in every aspect.\n\nFew pros:\n. A slight sliver of RPG style abilitie leveling.\n. I like the cave element.\n. Being able to move from island to island via boat is a good Idea.\n\nCons, Cons, and more Cons:\n.Extremelly poor performance, Can play FC4, BF4, and Witcher 3 on high with 60fps but am forced to play this game on the lowest of settings to get decent fps, and at that point this game looks like garbage. Everquest 1 comes to mind?\n.No players, 5 max  in any server is the highest iv seen.\n.The few players on a server are completely geared and KOS you out of shear bordom (its not the games fault, and I see where the players are coming from, bordom. And I cant imagine having more would be any more fun)\n.Hunting is a joke and extremely hard for early game players.\n.Food resources can be extremely difficult to come by, be prepared to starve.\n.The map is FILLED, like everywhere you look filled, with half built deserted shantys and large towers that drop fps even more.\n.Grind, and lots of it. Be prepared to put hours in hitting trees and stones with a rock  in order to even get a foundation down, but beware of the few geared players. Its definetly not attractive puttings hours in for little return just to be one hitted.\n.Lack of items. I never got to the point of having bronze gear (tier 3), but is that end game? like really?\n.Crafting is simple, a bad joke.\n\nConclusion: Its early access, I got what I payed for.  Being a huge fan of this genre of games, I would not spend a dime on this one, The lack of players and abundence of deserted beginning-game bases shows you that this game is not ready\nfor your money nor time. I few games I would recomend for a player looking for a survival sandbox would be; Rust, The Forest, Space Engineers, Medevil Engineers, 7 days to die, H1Z1, Arma 3 Exile mod, Minecraft, Reign of Kings or Grav.","October 26, 2015","false","4.1"," 32 of 65 people (49%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","49","32","65","4","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/battleunit/recommended/327090/","battleunit","jacksste","http://steamcommunity.com/id/battleunit/","14 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCastaways on an island and all that means seemed like a cool idea.  First off, this is an early Alpha review - things could change, and usually do.  Second, the game is not so much an established work in progress as a technology demontrator and is probably at least a year and possibly two from being worth spending money on.\n\nSo how does the game work?  You show up on an island, which I call starvation island.  That is a good name because there really is not much food there.  You are on a beach where "slow moving creatures live."  My beach was about 75 meters long and had no plants, animals, rocks (except for the rock I was holding) and only some water on one side and a steep climb to the main feature of the island, which is featurless rock mountains.  No worries.  You have, afterall, just ended up on a deserted island (or not so deserted, you have heard tales) and it is up to you to survive.  Given the steepness of the ascent, it seems safest to swim to a better location.\n\nBig mistake.  All of those classes at the Y are wasted, and you started to drown just a minute into the swim.  You turn around and arrive back at starvation beach (which will confuse people as I have also named the mountain starvation mountain and the island, if you remember, was already called starvation.\n\nSo the only way out is up.  It is on the way up you encounter your first tree.  Up until now you have no way to tell where your island is, but now you tree tells you that the island is tropical as you find an oil palm, a date palm, and what looks like an exotic paradise tree all clining to some rocks.  By this time you are starving, half dead, and no further along at saving yourself, so you haved no other option but to slam the rock into the tree, remember many days playing mine crat.  It pays off, and you soon cut the tree down, being rewarded with wood.  Hopefully you slam your rock into other things are are not rewarded with anything.\n\nIf you are used to games where the land is infinitely mallable such as WURM, LIF, or Planet Explorers, you will be disapointed with the throwback to 2006.  Some objects in the land can be smashed up, but I was unable to find any evidence of the landscape being modified by players.  Instead most trees were individual entities and when they get chopped down they disapeer.  This could explain why the world I was in seemed barren as over-exploitation and splurge levelling often destroyes true sandbox games as players first level harvesting, then level crafting my making enless numbers of junk structures.\n\nI soon found human habitation.  The sparce tropical vegetation and nude mountains that implied a water starved island out of the trade winds lead to a surreal copy of the South African veld holding the island's interior.  And with a flash my suspension of disbelief was lost.\n\nThe first creature I saw was a Bengal tiger.  Or maybe it was a Java tiger.  And it was sitting in what looked like an asian steppe environment.  And no island has this sort of steppe that I have ever seen.\n\nThere are savanna's on larger islands.  Tristan da Cunha has one.  And I have seen a colder, wetter version of this off Nova Scotia.  But no island that could possibly have a collection of Bengal tigers on it should have a large, African type savanna.\n\nThen I stumbled on a corn plant.  And quickly a wheat plant.\n\nFor the educated player, what island has tigers, dry savanna biome, sparse tropical vegetation, and also hosts short throwback corn and wheat.  Oh, and flax - very accurately rendered as a little blue-flowered plant.\n\nQuickly I was chased by what seemed to be a hippo (or rhino  - you cannot look over your shoulder when you are panic running) and I chased a gazelle and I knew that the art department had made a fundemental mistake - they had probably not invested the time researching their subject and putting their vision onto storyboards.\n\nSo, soon I was over the island.  I played with other people's houses, harvesting flax and throwing it into their footlockers, and I (finally) found a rock that could be harvested.  I also noted that while I could make a trebuchet, a boat only Gilligan would love, and a glider, I could not make a spear, club, or scraper, all of which would make more immediate sense than trying to find a vein of tin to start into the metal trade.\n\nThat was when I found the ship.  100 meters from shore, and fetched up tight.  An easy swim (well, a deadly one but one I could survive by eating right before I enered the water.  The ship was a wrecked rig, a very small, almost dinkly sail ship.  Here was what a survivor needed.  I thought of what on Pyrates said about ship wrecks, they are full of odds and ends that can help you survive.  Rope, and brass fittings, and lock mechnaism, and even biscuit and junk.  So I reisked it all and made it to the ship, only to discover it was a 3/4 size prop.\n\nIn conclusion - Out of Reach is a stable release alpha of a game that does not have any game yet, and needs some serious rethinking on its art and paradigms.","October 22, 2015","false","0.4"," 21 of 43 people (49%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","49","21","43","6","0"

Sure, the craft system is evolved, there are a lot of things to create and it is actually the only fun and solid part of the game, complex mechanics and original crafting objects.\nThere are also a lot of animals to meet and hunt but collisions and animations are really ugly...\n\nServers are almost empty ! so if you plan to have some interaction and/or action you will be disapointed for sure, it is like running in a desert and by luck find some one as lost as you are (each 45 mns - 1h hour of play). Your only solution is to come with 20 of your friends if they decide to buy the game of course or if you are rich enough to make gifts :p\n\nThe first seconds you enter the world of "out of reach" you're forced to admit the visual is horrible. We are in 2015 and even if it is still an alpha version, the minimum is not reached concerning the graphic system. It looks old, rusty and sad...even in high rez and with max settings on. A lot of Alpha games offer better graphics. Moreover, at this state of dev, Character animations are really poor and collisions a real pain...\n\nThere are bugs concerning buildings, some do not respect real physic...and are more than weird. (for example : multiples stairs rising up to the sky without any fondations/walls and in impossible angle).\n\nSo to be honest, I think this game as a real potential and will evolve in the right way so it is wise to wait some months at least before playing it because right now there's nothing really interesting.","October 3, 2015","false","0.9"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","48","12","25","4","0"

Yesterday i was on the others servers just to convince people to play on server where i play just to increase population from 7+- to something  more playable.(when we have that 75player limit on server) and i got an answer from the guys playing on those others servers astonished me totally -- they said something like- no thank you we love to play alone rather none is attacking or kiling you or trying to raid your base - so there i saw what is really happening. You gave to people too many servers so you dont have any populated servers that mean it is like magnet for ♥♥♥♥♥♥s who would like to play survival but they dont like to be killed by other player and once you have theese players there you will never have people who want to play true survival like hurtworld players or rust players... if you will not change or delete few servers just to increase population on FEW THEN YOU WILL SLOWLY DIE same way as Ravaged zombie apocalypse (truly nice game but devs ♥♥♥♥ed it with servers and afer a time it died ) DO SOMETHING WITH THAT DEVS!!!!!!!!! thank you","January 30","true","16.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Found out the only choices were "join public multiplayer server" and "visit Web site to read 11-page instruction manual on installing SQL Server to devote 2 GB RAM to hosting a dedicated server". Tried a public server.\n\nFirst impressions: pretty main graphics, clunky and barely readable UI, odd details like getting wood from intact trees and having no idea how to plant the seeds I found. Then it got dark (and the shadows followed me strangely), leaving me in the dark and rain with no way to see what I was doing and no way to get light. Tried to place a house foundation as the tutorial said, but could find no valid place to put it. Wandered in the dark looking for one; ran out of patience; now reviewing and requesting refund.

For now. The main reason is lack of players. Busiest server I played on was 8 people. Yes, I know it's in the "early release" stage, but the lack of any real player base hurts this game tremendously. The game play is what you would expect from this genre. The one thing that does stand out about this game the the abiity to explore by water and air. Now, with all that being said, the devs are hard at work and are applying constant updates and fixes. If you ahve some RL friends willing to make the leap with you it would be more entertaining. I just find the game gets super boring without any other player interaction.","February 2","false","4.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's basically a watered down survival game, with few to no unique elements. The graphics are passable, the gameplay is average (though you can advance quite easily compared to other survival games), and there aren't too many bugs for an early access game.\n\nHowever, there are several issues that stop me from wanting to come back to the game. The optimization is terrible, and I was confused when my 980ti couldn't run this game at a solid 60-above, and many of the animals and plants in the world are spread out so far and thin that you hardly ever find them. The ambient sounds of the game are litterally non-existent, other than a few looping bird sounds, giving the entire game an eerie feeling of loneliness, and not the immersive kind. To sum it up, the game feels simply to empty, and while it's fun to progress, I can't really see a reason to to begin with.","June 2","false","3.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It has a lot of the same mechanics you'll see out of every other survival game, with a few additions a lot of people think are 'unique' but are really just reskinned versions of the same mechanics found elsewhere.\n\nThere was a single populated pvp server at US primetime, in that server there were buildings every 10 feet leaving nowhere to build. Animals are no threat, you can seemingly outrun everything in the game.\n\nGraphics are ok, nothing to write home about but it ran smoothly for what they had.

However that's not the case. I found 16 flax seeds wandering around for 3 hours. I planted 16 plants, got back 5 seeds, planted 5 plants, got back no seeds. Wandered around again for 2 hours, found 3 seeds. Getting level is various skills is meaningless, really didn't see much of a difference. I read this has been an issue since last year September.\n\nWhen you get to base building stage, sometimes you can place a tile and then you can't and it really doesn't make any sense why. I built a partial base, I had foundations, walls, but could only place ceiling tiles on two of the edges, but none in the middle. THre are no other options the na wooden base.\n\nThere's a tutorial you can follow, but if you go out of order, it won't register it.\n\nThe most excitement I got out of it was to be chased by a rhino for a short distance.\n\nSetting up your own sever is an utter pain (I gave up). You have to download a third party software, then you have to what I guess is create a batch file to run it (the directions aren't exactly that clear). The explaination as to how to do all this takes you to another website, where it says you need to copy and paste some text into your batch file, except you can't copy or paste anything unless you reopen that website in a new browser. This also means that when you uninstall this game, you must also remember to uninstall the third party app as well. Good luck with that!\n\nAll in all I was generally bored to death after 3 hours.","June 2","false","7.0"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","1","6","0","0"

In that time I:\n- cut down enough trees to have 400 wood (it was night, I couldn't see ♥♥♥♥, so chopping trees was go)\n- found some stones. cut up those stones\n- tried to figure out the menu\n- made rock chips from thin air??? because at that point I didn't have any stones in my pack\n- found some corn and kept being told I couldn't do two things at once when trying to pick it (mind you no icon showed up)\n- found some cotton - this time some wait icon showed up but spamming click made it not appear\n- built a spear because ♥♥♥♥♥es love spears. this did not update the 'build a weapon' tutorial in the survival guide.\n- ran into a tiger\n- got my ♥♥♥ handed to me by said tiger\n- quit the game\n\nNow that might sound like a good time to you but frankly, it bored me to death. Even the battle with the tiger was boring as ♥♥♥♥, which is sad since it's a BATTLE WITH A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ TIGER!!!\n\nThe menu is clunky as ♥♥♥♥ to use, requiring you to click on choices more than once to activate them quite often. I know it's in Early Access but still... how do you make a tiger battle that boring?\n\norz\n\nI can't yet recommend this game to players. Maybe when it's no longer in Early Access.","May 7","false","0.4"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","5","15","3","0"

Literally have one of the best graphics card you can get and i get a lagspike every meter i walk, and the game feels like its locked at 30 frames. Textures look horrible. Grind is ridiculous. Takes about ten mins to gather all the stone and wood you need for most things, but then you need to get flax which is very rare for some reason, and every plant is about half a rope. Then you need bone, to get a bow (the lowest tier) and kill some animals. You get it from animals themselves which either 1. Kill you in two shots or 2. Run away at the speed of sound and never tire. Spears dont help, you cannot throw them. So there is no way to actually kill an animal without a bow, which actually requires bone, so you cant even kill an animal without getting lucky by it trapping itself in a tree or something.\n\n\nPros:\n\nFun at first.\n\nCons:\n\nToxic community (RDM everywhere, no such thing as teaming.)\n\nAlmost no people on servers\n\nCannot progress past a certain point\n\nEye-♥♥♥♥ graphics and absolutely horrible lagspikes\n\nBugs\n\nFeels like locked at 30 frames\n\nAbsolutely horrible grind\n\n♥♥♥♥♥♥ levelling system (other players have huge advantages over others just cause they chopped more trees or somehow killed more animals then the other player)\n\nCrappy raiding system (take ten hours to claim and destroy a base)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinetely getting a refund.","November 15, 2015","false","0.8"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

" but No! i cant figure out how to consume this fish. so back to the hunt for berries , corn or mushrooms, 50 minutes in and ive fould some more flax, wood and stone so i make a spear, mainly cus i saw some Tigers running around, i found a big nice meadow with some Tigers, Zebras and Antilopes, by now my food meter has become red and im very hungry, still i have nof found any food other than the fish in the yarn, so i minded my own buisness looting the flax and looking through the meadow for food when this one Tiger came at me, i hit it some times with the spear at no awail, the Tiger bit me like 3-4 times and then i was dead! So then after almoust an hour in the game, struggling to find food, that shoud be pretty easy in sutch survival games. i quit.

Hubby and I both played and if you play Ark or 7 Days or even Rust, we've just been spoiled by those games to enjoy this one. It's nothing new, intuitive, the UI, building, mechanics, and crafting is just too generic. The graphics aren't all that impressive. Even Minecraft beats this. I know the devs worked really hard, great job Space Boat, I support all indie devs, but there is no market at this point for us (my guy and I) to enjoy Out of Reach.
