I initially thought that the game had buggy edge detection for grabbing ledges, but it turned out that I had just missed that you have to press the up key as well to grab on.\n\nThe game is difficult. Two enemies with guns can kill you easily. A gun + melee combo can also be a challenge. Towards the end of my session I came across a warehouse filled with enemies and turrets that seemed impossible to take on. I spent all my skill points unlocking persuasion and lockpicking, so I guess this was the game punishing me for not investing in aggressive hacking or combat skills. In this regard the game reminded me more of Alpha Protocol than Deus Ex - it takes your skill choices quite seriously and will gladly border stuff off if you come unprepared. There is also no quicksaving to manipulate conversations, although you can back up checkpoints as you enter new areas (just like AP).\n\nThe story has been okay so far. It is typical cyberpunk fare with hacking, ais, megacorporations, human augmentation and so on. After the short introduction, the main story seems to be on the backburner, leaving you to explore the city and do sidequests.\n\nI recommend the game. Fans of Deus Ex, Alpha Protocol and VtM:Bloodlines will probably have a good time with the game.","May 7, 2015","true","12.2"," 128 of 143 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","128","143","3","2"

It has a lot going for it, but the execution is far, far from polished and even the first hour of the game is more an exercise in frustration than pleasure.\n\nFirst, the good:\n\n1. The writing is very good. It's clear that someone with a lot of talent put a lot of heart into the script. Bad writing is one of the perennial, almost universal hallmarks of video games, but this game deftly avoids that pitfall.\n\n2. The voice acting is phenomenal. Just like the writer(s), the voice actors portray their characters with passion and fluidity, and their performances are convincing, rather than "video game voice acting". There are AAA games with worse voice acting than this game.\n\n3. The visual aesthetic, while nothing exceptional, is solid and convincing. The game looks good in screenshots.\n\n4. The concept underpinning the game--2D action RPG brawler--gets my blood pumping. One of my favorite genres, and one that I think is underserved.\n\n5. The game is fairly forgiving of mistakes and death. You always have the option of restarting from the beginning of the screen you died in, although this turns out to be a double-edged sword as well (see below).\n\nAnd now for the bad:\n\n1. Remember when I said "the game looks good in screenshots"? It does, but it looks awful in motion. The animations are stiff, with few to no transitional frames between sprites, which gives combat a jerky, unfinished quality that looks like it's still in the conceptual stage. Even simple movement gives the impression that the characters are skating or gliding rather than walking or running, as animations are not precisely keyed to movement speeds of characters.\n\nThe game also has almost no visual feedback for events, even ostensibly important ones. For instance, during the opening tutorial-like sequence, you are instructed to perform a task in AR to seal a door against men coming to kill you. Visually, the entire sequence is greatly underwhelming, almost no animations accompanied the task (destroying a firewall around the door controls), and initially I did not even know I had accomplished the task because there was no visual indicator that it had been finished aside from a portion of the AR node disappearing (not fading, not fizzling, not exploding, just pop, gone).\n\n2. The audio is almost non-existent. What music there is is good, but there isn't much of it. There are very few audio cues for actions or events, which combined with the lack of visual feedback makes playing the game feel like you're an incorporeal ghost floating through the world. Walking through a jet of superheated steam inflicts damage to your character, but does not so much as elicit a hiss from the game. Enemies don't make noise as you fight them, and impacts in combat lack any sort of punch or weight because there is next to no audio feedback when they land. When you die, you fall over soundlessly.\n\n3. It's a good thing that the game is forgiving of death, because the game punishes you severely for making even minor mistakes. There are many bottomless pits promising instant death, and I guarantee that you will fall into them sooner rather than later, because they are poorly demarcated and there is no good way to distinguish "pit that I'm not supposed to jump into" from "pit that I'm supposed to jump into". Environmental hazards are savage and even a few seconds in one is good enough to kill you in many cases. This would be more palatable if those same hazards were more clearly visually identified: steam jets are easy to see, but toxic gas is mostly identified by the fact that your character suddenly starts taking rapid damage.\n\n4. But it's not all great that the game is forgiving of death. It's not only possible but very easy to place yourself into a situation where you die or take damage immediately upon entering a room, and if you die in that room, guess where you restart? That's right: at the beginning of the same room. I hope you had an earlier save. What's worse is that the game loads you from the beginning of the area (essentially loading an autosave), it doesn't keep track of environmental variables. That trap puzzle that you worked through to get to where you are? Turns out that's a one-way trip and you don't have a way back except to take massive damage. Oh, is your health too low? Hope you had an earlier save.\n\nThe last item in particular is what made me stop playing the game and what will probably prevent me from continuing to play it. I want to like the game, but it's clear that for all of the loving care placed into the script and acting, the game's GAME parts are untested and ill-conceived, leading to pretty egregious death loops and lost progress. Which might even be excusable if the combat had more weight and punch to it. As it is, the gameplay feels thin and hollow because the game makes it look and sound thin and hollow.\n\nIt's a good start, and I expect that the developers will be able to produce a sequel or remastered version that have more punch and more well-considered level design in due time. But I'll be waiting for that version instead of playing this one.","May 9, 2015","false","0.6"," 208 of 261 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","208","261","6","5"

The world is immersive and large. There's a lot to do, lots of quests and dialogue, and the setting is cyberpunk at it's finest. The world really holds true to it's cyberpunk roots, and that's what drew me in initially. However, the game itself though is just too buggy.\n\nFirst of all, saving the game doesn't save all of the information you'd assume it would, so you end up losing progress every time you re-load the game. Apparently there's a forum post on how the saving system works, but that just proves my point. Overall, the save system makes you feel unassured that your progress is safe, which was enough to drive me away from playing any more.\n\nTo add to that, there have been multiple instances where I've been in combat and entered a cinematic, but combat went on behind the cinematic and I died, while the cinematic was playing. There were also some abilities that I was able to activate, but I couldn't pinpoint how I was activating them. I later learned that these abilities were only supposed to be available after upgrading your stats upon level-up, which proved that the upgrade system was bugged and broken. Too many bugs.\n\nEdit: I didn't realize so many people would be reading this review, so I've elaborated a bit!\nEdit 2: I'll update the review once I've play the latest version.","May 7, 2015","false","2.0"," 264 of 346 people (76%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","76","264","346","9","13"

The complex is after you! My name is Raycast, I hacked into your network to give you some guidance. What you see outside is Harbor Prime, a dystopian mega town, covered with darkness and smoke. But there is no time for you, use the cyberspace to disable the door and make your way out of there. Sneak through the sewers, get into Fixers Hope and find a man called Decker, he will surely help you.\n\nIf my introduction made you feel like Matrix met V for Vendetta and the main theme of the Shinra Corp. makes it’s way back into your head, you are in the right mood for this game. As you already noticed, Dex is your name and survival is your aim. A hacker called Raycast makes your sweet neckplate-wearing body move, right into the arms of some retired hacker and his over-cautious friend. They present you a story about a powerful AI, named Kether, that got created by The Complex, a Megacorp,  in order to reach control of every network ever created. That may sound like a fairytale but doesn’t explain exactly why you were chased and what the famous hacker Raycast wants from you.\n\nThis is how you will get started in Dex, a Sidescrolling Steampunk Cyber RPG, presented with 2D-Graphics, that mixes Metroidvanian-platforming and open world experience with some heavy plot influences of Deus Ex. Let`s see whether developer Dreadlocks succeeded in combining this cocktail or left you getting lost in cyberspace. First, graphics are nice, with hand-drawn locations and 90`s style animations. It feels a bit like crossing old Beat em up stages if you move from one district to another. Characters are well drawn too but animations of enemies tend to look a bit clunky sometimes.\n\nA big city like Harbor Prime needs music and sounds to paint the illusion of a living and breathing environment but Dex could use a bit of improvement here. The music is great and every district has it’s unique style like Chinatown, which got heavily influenced by traditional Asian instruments whereas the rich and industrial Highrise has a cold, more mechanical touch. You can hear some cars or even hot fat that boils in a frying pan when entering a restaurant. What is missing are the people. It feels like they are all quietly moving along. No beggar shouts for money, no hooker praises her legs, no child laughs..or cries.\n\nWhat makes Dex shine are the dialogues. Every NPC you can interact with has a voice and well written dialogue. May it be an old sailor or a drug dealing kid on the streets, it feels like the developers invested a lot of time into the game’s story. And talking about story, we slowly approach the core of the game. You can strictly follow the main plot but doing so means you will miss lots of interesting side quests. Dex wants to be open-world and thus allows you to explore the whole city on your own. Have in mind that you might encounter situations or enemies you aren’t ready for, like a jump passage you can’t pass yet. You will die. You will curse this game. But you will come back for its great stories. There is much more in Harbor Prime than just The Complex. Digging under the surface allows a look in a society where hackers are gods, corporations fight each other in dirty ways and people who haven’t implemented a mechanical part into their body are considered outsiders.\n\nAll you need to know is how to solve and to survive. Every quest earns EXP and maybe Gold or other usefull stuff. Use EXP to level up Dex, unlock and upgrade skills, varying from Melee to Hacking and even Charisma, altering your playstyle and how you want to finish quests. Up for satisfying close combat? Become a Melee Expert! Talking your way out of trouble or get secrets while examining Others? Charisma may become your best friend. Gold is important to get medicine or weapons, even more important to get augmentations to make yourself a true cyber warrior with the ability to cloak yourself or get immunity against toxic gas.\n\nCyberspace, the last one on my checklist. Hacking and entering the network will save your life and provide you with necessary information. Dex can hack cameras, turrets and even other people to harm, kill or at least stun them. She can also enter the network and fight her way through it, offering you a game inside the game. Doing so you fight against viruses, trojans and firewalls, hopefully finding some useful e-mails or passwords to provide yourself with EXP, Gold and Satisfaction.\n\nBig Text, Quick Facts:\nPro:\nRetrolook Steampunk RPG with a heavy touch of 90`s games\nDex is great - blue hair, black humour,\nBeautiful Backgrounds\nMusic sounds good and fits the setting\nInteresting plot and Side-Quests\nWell written dialogues and credible NPCs\nSkill system: Find your own way of solving a problem - fighting, talking, hacking\nImplement augmentations and upgrade Dex - jump higher, hit harder, act tougher\nCon:\nTrial and error gets hard sometimes - Open-World-Problems\nSaves work like checkpoints - leave the district if you want to save your progress!\nDescription of items is too small\nStrange Keybindings (like Guard on Shift but Dodge on Q) - can be reassigned\nQuiet townfolk\n\nSummary:\nDex earned many bad reviews after it got released too early. It suffered from game breaking bugs, corrupted save files and many other things that made it nearly unplayable right after the start. But the latest updates fixed most of the problems people were arguing about and I did not encounter any bug myself while playing. That said the community still rages about the save system that uses checkpoints instead of a real savefile. All I can say about that is: once you get used to it, you will be fine.\n\nIt took me some time to find into the game but right now, it totally satisfies. Once you got used to the controls, the town, the dying, you will start exploring and find quests, that offer great dialogues and a lot to think about in the “not so bright” future. It’s not like Dex is a perfect game but the cocktail tastes good and I definitely recommend this brew to steampunk lovers and RPG-fans, who like their Deus Ex turned into a sidescrolling 2D experience.\n\nPersonal Verdict: 8,5/10","May 18, 2015","true","25.6"," 74 of 81 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","74","81","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/matseb2611/recommended/269650/","matseb2611","White Shadow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/matseb2611/","317 products in account","To start off my review, I want to say that Dex is a really fun game and I would most certainly recommend it. However, there are a number of bugs and gameplay issues that can hinder the overall experience, and although I enjoyed the game, I can't help but to feel some disappointment in the final execution. To put it short, if you want a casual experience just to enjoy the story, this game might not be for you.\n\nNow to break everything down. Dex takes place in a really cool cyberpunk setting. As a fan of sci-fi and cyberpunk, I think the game captures the cyberpunk feel perfectly. The art is truly superb. The character sprites look great, and the environments are very colourful and beautifully done. Dex proves to us that you don't need a game to be all grey and brown to show a gritty setting. This is complemented by a lovely musical score. Music playing in every area was fitting to the setting and memorable. Most notable one is the main theme, which has become one of my personal favourite main themes in gaming.\n\nThe story has its good points, but overall it's a pretty standard cyberpunk story. Hackers, gangsters, evil corporations, secret experiments - all this stuff makes an appearance. To me most issues come in the gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay consists of a mix of stealth, combat, and hacking in cyberspace. Hand-to-hand combat was really well done. The fighting was smooth and each impact was felt. By contrast, gun combat was done rather badly. For some odd reason, it's not possible to walk with your gun out. If you want to shoot, you have to stand absolutely still. If you make so much as a step, the character automatically holsters the gun. This can become extremely annoying during fight sequences, where each second can mean a difference between shooting the enemy and them taking off half of your healthbar.\n\nThe platforming aspects such as jumping and climbing were fine enough, although at times it was very hard to tell where you could jump onto and where you couldn't. At times it seemed like you could jump onto something, only to see your character fall through it and to their death. And because you cannot save when you want, this becomes annoying.\n\nHacking... ugh. I just didn't like it at all. It was nothing more than a basic pixel shooter and your sole job is to click, click, and click. What annoyed me more than the hacking mini-game itself is the fact how often the game forced you to play it. Most times there were no alternatives. Play the darn hacking mini-game or make no progress. I signed up for a cyberpunk sidescroller, not a cyberspace pixel shooter.\n\nThe game also had some balance issues. Like for example, there was no permanent cheap/free heal anywhere in the city. So if you were out of money and low on health, there's probably nothing you can do about it. Likewise, there was never any place where I could grind for money and/or experience.\n\nThe game had plenty of sidequests. Most were pretty interesting and I attempted to solve each one of them. However, quite a few of them I never managed to solve due to things not being clear. Maybe I just needed to do more exploration or simply to get lucky, but I think a bit more direction would've been nice. What was nice though is how some main quests and sidequests had nice multi-branched paths to accomplishing your goal and at times you had to make important decisions.\n\nFinally to round it off, the ending was extremely disappointing and felt rushed. Without giving any spoilers, the game forces you to do your "final fight" in cyberspace. That's right. Hacking again. And the ending cutscene lasted a total of 10 seconds. I really wish there was more to the ending than what I've experienced.\n\nI know this is a tonne of criticism, but I am glad to have played through this game, and it is a promising game. It's just, it's currently riddled with too many small issues, which pile up and hinder the enjoyment.","June 22, 2015","true","14.4"," 66 of 72 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","66","72","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/julespetrikov/recommended/269650/","julespetrikov","Widerstand","http://steamcommunity.com/id/julespetrikov/","65 products in account","Dex is a 2D science fiction action roleplaying game that might seem linear at the first glance but is full of surprises and will eventually make you consider your choices, once you face the consequences. Needless to say, from the Storytelling perspective, it will punish you for mistaking this game as a sidescroller. It is, in fact, a roleplaying game and a proper one, I might add. - Oh boy, I have no idea where to start. This might take a while and a bit reading.\n\nDex combines many elements from different genres together and does it quite well. At least this is my opinion, since I've felt exactly like I'm playing a damn good, well put together, professionally written RPG. Therefore you get a set of interesting approaches to playing the game; while the character progression will allow you to improve your abilities, and they will actually improve how you play the game as you progress on different skills, your interaction with the environment will heavily be affected by the choices you made - not to mention that the implants you're going to get will seem optional but the game will continuously itch the urge to upgrade your augmentations and/or install new ones in order to avoid various obstacles that are not necessarily mandatory for the main progression. Yet you will run around for more quests, more experience and more money to get implants, buy softwares and progress on side stories, because you will be having your fun.\n\nThe main story, however, is relatively short. This is true if you take the side quests as optional activities. But, believe me, they are not. The progression you will have on side activities will greatly help on your main course and will actually affect the future steps of your progression. - For example, before going on a main mission, completing side activities and talking to people who you have done jobs for in the past and learning about your main quest will end up in several side quests that will not only make your main quest relatively easier, it will also end up with more experience and more money you earn in return. - This approach alone should tell you that Dex is not just another attempt to recreate what has been done in the past, but a product of the good perspective what we call "if it ain't broken, break it and build something better" - it is exactly what has been done in this project.\n\nNow, it is to be expected from a cyberpunk theme that hacking should exist in such games. Dex's hacking is a minigame that is affected by your character progression. As you progress on your hacking skills, your minigame will become easier -of course, the damn black holes are there to torture our bloody souls- but there's always side progression to it; software upgrades can be bought and there are also usable items while in Augmented Reality. - This also is a huge help while in hand-in-hand combat, because you can just go into AR and hack into your enemies' implants and stun them for a while, which is also a part of the stealth system. - and, oh yeah, there is stealth. You can takedown your enemies from behind, you can get into cover, get invisible for a while. But there's also using enemy turrets against them and letting the tools do your dirty work.\n\nImplants are a bit dull, unfortunately. Nothing actually that interesting there. But who cares, you can jump higher, regenerate health, become invisible, change your field of view, detect enemies etc. - Fun little things. They do greatly affect the gameplay, however. So It wouldn't be wise to say they aren't mandatory, but aside from the jumping the rest is pretty much optional; Things like an inhaler and immunity to electricity are quite the quality of life improvements.\n\nBefore getting into the story and the characters, I have to point out some notes. - There are some sound design flaws. Character Voices and Background Music sound levels have certain problems. However, I played the game on GNU/Linux, which shouldn't be a problem at all, but after experiencing some launch issues on almost every DE and hearing sounds overlapping, I had to guess that there are problems somewhere between ALSA drivers working poorly with the engine and unpolished state of the game. - Now, I have to point out the elephant in the room, Dex is an unpolished game. No, it is not an unfinished game, it is an unpolished game. I don't know why this is the case, but you will encounter some ugliness. But will this affect your gameplay? No. Not at all. In fact, you will easily forget about the problems like words overflowing the dialog screen, or pretty much every menu content running over the menu textures and things like inconsistent scrolling.\n\nAgain, these are minor problems. Doesn't affect the game in a great way. So, they didn't really bug me at all.\n\nVoiceacting is outstanding. Actors did gave life to every single one of these characters - a professional approach of narrative. Infused with lovely, extremely good animated cutscenes and the well written lines describing the heavy atmosphere and the reactions of characters, the quality of the production does speak for itself. There's nothing more to say about this, really. I loved every bit of it. I listened every bit that characters had to offer and loved every line. Dex, truly is not a wasted potential. In fact, it's a perfect begining for an independent team.\n\nOf course, you might not be into such artstyle. Which is completely understandable.\n\nKarel Antonin did an amazing job with the Soundtrack. - and Dex's Soundtrack Album became one of the Soundtracks that I wanted badly. A good friend of mine acted way before me and gifted me the album, for that I am really, really thankful. Because make no mistakes folk, this is an extraordinary work for an Independent Game - actually, forget about the Independent label, Dex's Soundtrack is an artistically accurate approach to this game and I salute the people who put the time and effort to compose and release this piece of artwork. And, you know what, if anything; I highly recommend buying the soundtrack. It does worth the price. I, kid you, not.\n\nNow the hard part, the Storyline. - Well, Dex takes place within a futuristic society and you play as Dex, a woman you hardly know anything about. Has absolutely no skills whatsoever, just trying to stay alive. At this point the narrative is so strong that while you're running away, the music, the background the jumps you have to make, in the very first ten minutes, the game makes you feel like you're living these moments from her perspective and you literally live for her. - and then, you find yourself on an elevator, going down, you see the logo with a beatifully composed theme. You are living in the movie, you are experiencing the game. - and believe me, as someone who has experience in the industry, this art direction, this story driven introduction is pure professionalism; it is idealism. For that, I very much so in love with everyone who's involved with this project.\n\nFrom that point forward, Dex has to meet with a couple of others who has been driven into this corporate level series of conspiracies and she has to make vital decisions, with consequences. - Her character is in your very hands.\n\nDex is one of those well-written hidden gems with great design decisions and a product of sincere endeavour. If you are into science fiction; if you love cyberpunk theme, this piece of art is here, waiting in the shadows, glowing. All you need to do is to take a look. You will see the potential and you will see the artistic effort. - Support these people. Believe me, they will deliver more and they will deliver better.\n\nNote - I wrote this review at 4 in the morning. So, I'm terribly sorry about the typos.","December 8, 2015","true","22.1"," 47 of 51 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","47","51","3","0"

Then i'll keep it simple.\n\nDex is great game that is hard to recommend despite it being so good.\n\nIt has so many issues, as well as some baffling basic design oversights, that it would easily turn off so many people from the very start.\n\nHowever if you dig through the dirt, mud and other various amounts of filth, you'll find something that truly shines with a LOT of potential, especially in comparison to what's currently on Steam as of late.\n\nThe melee combat and shooting all packs a punch and is very enjoyable. The RPG mechanics are varied, robust and are tailored to how YOU want to play, as well as the story and world the devs created being extremely interesting and a unique take on the genre.\n\nThing is you'll have to dig a through a lot of ♥♥♥♥ to fully enjoy it. Dex is a bit like Alpha Protocol in that regard. Lot of potential, but is so bugged up the fudge hole that a person suffering from Crabs would cringe. It all depends on how much you can suffer through.\n\nFor those wanting a proper review there's more after the break...\n\n\n\n//////////////\n\n\nAlright, time to go balls deep into Dex.\n\nIf i had to describe what Dex is to someone i'd say this:\n\nDex is a third-person, side scrolling RPG that has a large emphasis on a unique hacking premise with some shooting and brawling and even some basic stealth mixed in for good measure. The game is set in a original cyberpunk world where augmentations are all the rage and hacking is a good way to rack up some cash, this is all drawn and animated in astounding detail which creates a very interesting aesthetic.\n\nIt's a little like if the original Deus Ex got drunk one night and knocked up Shantae & The Pirate's Curse, nine months later this red headed, freckle faced mix of both games pops out as an indie game available on Steam for twenty bucks.\n\nThat Deus Ex comparison isn't unwarranted either. Dex is a full blown RPG with action elements, instead of an action RPG like Deus Ex Human Revolution. You suck at everything until you level that skill up, or get a specific augmentation to enhance it.\n\nFor example: Do you want to carry shotguns and SMGs into battle and fire them with pinpoint accuracy?\n\nBetter save up your skill points then!\n\nWant to be able to lock pick almost every single locked door in the game not problem?\n\nGrind your exp and then level the ♥♥♥♥ up!\n\nWant to be able to coerce pimps into lending you their fanciest male hookers for a kinky bang-time at a discount?\n\nLevel up your charisma, pick the right choice during dialogue, and have fun you perverted freak!\n\nSpeaking of which, yes there's a dialogue system in Dex! Even if you have maxed out charisma you need to pick the way way of coercing someone at the time. Some people respond to threats, others respond to bribes, and others respond to flattery. Pick the wrong one, and you'd best reload a save and try again buddy!\n\nIt works well, and always keeps conversations tense as you need to always pay attention to what they say.\n\nThe writing itself is very well done and descriptive, kinda reminds me of the old cRPGs of yesteryear. The dialogue is also voice acted and...... here's where Dex starts to fall apart.\n\nThe voice actors aren't bad at all and always suit the character and role their playing, but the actual voice direction itself leaves something to be desired. It always seems like they took only one take for each line and it can sound extremely amateurish and awkward at times. You can turn voices off in the option screen of the main menu if you wish, but then during cutscenes they'll be completely silent except for the bombastic (and rather nice i might add) score blasting over stock still images.\n\nWhile we're on the bad side of this i'll also add that some sound effects in general just seem to be completely ♥♥♥♥ing missing or non-existent! For example during the game you can sneak up on some unaware thugs and choke them to death, giving the same amount of exp for little to no effort as well as avoiding any possible injuries, but they make no sound! The chick you play as just dry humps them for a moment and they fall dead, again with absolutely no noise to accompany it, not even when the body falls down.\n\nIf i sneak up on someone and snap their bloody neck in a video game, i expect to hear a sickening *CRACK* to go along with the action, it's just plain unnerving when it doesn't.\n\nAnother thing wrong is the control scheme for both the controller and the keyboard and mouse. Some keys are just in a weird unnatural spot!\n\n'Q' to dodge during melee??? Who was the pants on head ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who chose THAT brilliant key placement?\n\nAnd i have never played a game, that had these few actual commands to input, that has forced me to use the '~' key.\n\nAlso the jumping has some weird form of gravity that drops if you don't hold in spacebar until you fully finish the jump. If you let go too earlier be prepared to drop like a sack of bricks.\n\nThe devs have patched the game so that you can rebind keys, so props to them, but this should have been thought out more clearly from the start.\n\nThere are also a few visual glitches here and there, and some that really hinder the gameplay like the journal getting confused and ♥♥♥♥ing up.\n\nI guess it sounds like i really hate the game, but it's the opposite. There is a brilliant game here buried underneath some confusing design choices.\n\nWhile stealth is aggravatingly basic (walk behind someone and press a button to insta-kill) the actual melee combat is simple but satisfying and deep, with a basic one two punch combo, dodging, blocking, and special moves unlocked the more points you put into the fighting skill.\n\nPlus if you don't feel like getting your hands dirty you can always pull out a great big ♥♥♥♥ing magnum revolver and empty it into someones cranium as fast as you can pull the trigger. Skill points in the guns skill also unlock more weapons that you able to use, as well as reducing accuracy, recoil and stuff like that.\n\nLike previously mentioned there are other skills you can upgrade such as:\n\nEndurance\nHacking\nLockpicking\nCharisma\nand a few more\n\nHacking plays a key role in the story of Dex, and as such, has it's own mini-game dedicated to it. Without going into it too much it's fun, encourages thoroughness and skill, and never gets tedious or unwelcome.\n\nThere is also an abundance of side-quests and the most that i have encountered are well done, with good writing, always worth the effort for the cash ( or other bonuses reward ), as well as having some various options of how exactly to complete them.\n\nI won't go into the story as i generally believe that the story in a game can fall apart if you know too much beforehand. Believe me when i say it IS worth your time.\n\nAll in all, Dex is worth the time of any patient RPG fan. Especially those with a massive throbbing hard-on for cyberpunk such as myself, and ESPECIALLY those who are looking for something akin to the original Deus Ex. Even with all the problems i mentioned.\n\nIs it perfect? No, Mia Khalifa isn't perfect either but you can bet that if she was willing i'd jump her bones like a starving hound!\n\nWorth every penny.","May 10, 2015","true","11.6"," 47 of 57 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","47","57","5","0"

I tried to like this game.   Truth be told, I don't *dislike* it but, I also don't really like it either. "Thumb sideways" is a good way to describe my feelings.  Since that's not an option, I give it a thumbs down because on balance I do rather regret the purchase.   I'm too broke to buy games that I can't return and don't enjoy.\n\nThe main story is fine, the side quests are playable (or you can forget about them without penalty), the world is believable, the graphics are....well you get what you pay for.\n\nThe problem is that the game play itself is almost a grind right out of the gate.  Your base fighting options are limited in the extreme (punch, shoot).  Your weapon choices are equally limited -- five guns and a taser.  You can't walk and shoot.  You can't even turn and shoot.  You have to stand and shoot.  There is no option to run and hide either.  Once the enemy spots you, you're spotted until you're dead or he's dead (the enemies are uniformly male).\n\nAs for the hacking, it is -- if anything -- even more limited. The whole thing reminded me a game from the 80s.   There is a grand total of ONE puzzle.  The very thing that drew me to the game ended up being the thing I liked least of all.\n\nNot that there aren't good points.  Far and away the strongest point is the dialogue.  The scripts are well written and at least 75% of the time the actors don't sound like they are acting.  Instead they sound like people.  There are also moments where the "right" course of action wasn't clear and times where it wasn't desirable either.  For someone (me) who naturally gravitates towards the simon-pure "good" side of the good/evil continuum playing a game where I was A-OK with wanting to do something "evil" was a novel experience.\n\nYMMV.","May 27, 2015","false","44.1"," 62 of 94 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","62","94","2","0"

But when you see Dex, you'd say the studio must have a larger history because the game is just so well done. It has its flaws too, it's by no means a perfect game but personlay I have not encountered any game-breaking bugs.\n\nThe setting is done right, the music, your surroundings everything is true to the cyberpunk theme. You'll be going through several locations including the sewers, the "heart" of the city, outside parts of the city and you'll be able to explore several buildings you'll come across. All these locations ahve very well done backgrounds and foregrounds that do not "get in the way" so to say. The city streets feel alive as you're running by many civilians and the ocasionall dog here and there. Music is where you'd expect it to be, it is well made and fits right into the game. If you have ever played Deus Ex, you know what to expect.\n\nThe combat is simple in its core but it still can get very interesting. There's not that much you can do excep click like a maniac to perform your fightning combo, this combo never changes, only certain elements gets added to it as you level up and put some skill points into close range combat. You can also learn "air kick" and the old "I'll spin around on the floor and make you fall" move. You can sneak up to your oponent and choke him. That's about it for close range combat. You also have ranged weapons, at first you can only use your standard 9mm gun, if you want to give some of the better machinery a try, you'll have to spend some of your skill points to ranged weapons. Ranged weapons can be used effectively but there are situations where you just don't want to use one, let's say you're surrounded, in this situation you're going to have a hard time gunning your oponents down, you'll have to have a distance, that's where you can start shooting. I never used weapons much, I find close combat more exciting so I never got to try any other weapons except for the standard 9mm gun. And there's third mechanic when it comes to combat - hacking. You can criple, damage and paralize your oponets by hacking if you have the required skill. While hacking, time freezes so use that to your advantage! Combine all this and imagine that you are going agains a team of four enemies, one has a ranged gun, the other has a chain, one is a slow big guy that punches hard and your standard sized fella that will kick you if you come close, now this is where it gets interesting. You will feel challanged and it's damn fun! Later on, almost at the end of the game, the challange is not that much there anymore as you have all sorts of crazy augmentations, you feel like you could take on an army but I believe that was intentional, you're slowly becoming a "super human" and as the doctor said, you simply kick-♥♥♥ harder!\n\nThat all is nice and dandy but what about the AI? That part is honestly week, enemies can't jump over obstackles so you can hide from the easily and even tho they should know where you are, they will not go after you, they don't know how. Or another example where enemies are standing above you, they know you're below them, they shoot into the groud, but are they going to go after you when right in front of them is a drop down where they could get you? no... no that won't happen. I have also encountered a strange bug where sometimes when I would re-enter a location with enemies or simply run away a bit and come back, the enemies would just stand there, doing nothing and I could kill them with no trouble. That happened twice to me and once on a boss fight, made the boss a laugh as you can imagine. But these bugs weren't frequent and I have no clue what causes them.\n\nMentioned hacking didn't we, well outside of humans, you can destroy cameras and turrets with hacking too, makes going through a heavily guarded location easier. Hacking is very simple, you shoot the shield long enough untill it goes away, you get close to the target and click the action you want to do and wait while "viruses" will try and approach you. If too many are going to get to you, you're going to lose focus too quickly and droping to 0 will cause you to lose 50 HP and you'll have to re-do the hacking. but it's really easy and the viruses are not smart. they will get "stuck" behind the objeck you're hacking and there's no escape for them, they just blindly follow your direction. Again the AI is kinda sucky. And you have computer hacking where you'll get to read personal e-mails, steal some savings and get EXP. That's a whole new mini-game and I though I wouldn't like it much but I did. It's fun hacking into a computer.\n\nThe story is pretty good! And it kept me going untill the end, you're going to uncover many secrets about some organizations and about yourself as well. There are more endings too, I am not quite sure how many, I want to say there are 4 of them as you have to make some decisions towards the end that will affect it. But there might be a bit more, aside from that there's not that many reasons to re-play the game, I didn't notice any "new game+" you simply have to start over, there are no "rendom events" that I am aware of that would make the game more interesting. Maybe chosing a higher difficulty would give it some spice again. Side quests are here and there's quite a few of them. All of them have their own stories that are surprisingly interesting as well. You're going to find an old man on the street that might seem crazy to you, talking about a plan to save the world and he needs some pils to make the voices go away. YOu get him his pils and he's going to tell you to hack 5 machines... cola dispenser and the like, so he can get a "cut" from all purchases. You do that and later on you're going to notice he's not at his usuall spot on the street anymore, you can later find his shop that he opened, you helped the man get off the street and do something for himself. You'll have to find out for yourself what happened to the plan to save the world *wink wink*. All the side quests have some story like this and I loved them!\n\nSome mechanical flaws... You can't save the game yourself, insted it saves automaticly when you enter a different area. That's in place so you can't "cheat" your way through dialogue trees when the game gives you 3 options to try and convince someone, only one of them is right. You could simply save and load to get it right. Problem is, you can still do that... It's just less convenient and not being able to save yourself can cause you to lose some progress. Not too much progress but still. Let's say you fought your way to a boss but you don't feel like going after him right now and will do it tommorow. You exit the game and the next time you load in, you'll find yourself at the enterance to the area again. Can be a bit frustrating.\n\nThe voiceover is phenomenal, the characters really feel alive. The only voiced character who I didn't like was this asian lady, it's crystal clear that someone who isn't asian at all is trying hard to sound like one, but it isn't working out. But that's one voiced character out of many. Really the voiceovers are awesome +1 for that!\n\nAll in all, the game has its flaws but there are many many more good things abut this game, that I can overlook it. I don't like scoring but I'd put the game at 7/10, still above average but not quite at the top yet. Is it worth your time? Totaly! If you're not put off by the setting of this game, you'll love it. I wish there were more games like this.","August 11, 2015","true","14.0"," 28 of 36 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","28","36","0","0"

Yet oddly is one of the best damn Cyberpunk style games I have seen in the last couple of years. Everything feels alive and detailed in this side-scrolling, open-world cyberpunk RPG.  The story is simple enough with familiar tones. Huge mega corporations wants you for some nefarious reason. Along the way you meet all sorts of different characters. What I love about Dex is that each of these character has so much detail to them. They feel like they have lived in this city their entire lives. The art of Dex is something that drew my eyes and I couldn't look away. Grand spectacles like the signs of the Aphrodite club. To the zoomed in details of a flickering sign. All of this and more has an extreme attention to detail. The combat/leveling aspects to Dex are not as robust as something like Shadowrun. It still manages to give you a feeling of customization to Dex. Picking up Lockpicking instead of combat skills or Hacking over health all can affect your style of play and how you move through a mission. Speaking of missions they are EVERYWHERE in this game. I seemingly found something or someone who had a job for me behind every nit and cranny. So rather your blasting your way through the doors or talking your way in. Dex is a game with many paths. To top off the cake that is Dex. You have full controller support, voice acting, hacking, and more!\nHonestly if your a fan of Cyberpunk, Open world games, or love pixel art. Get Dex.

There are some issues though, such as inventory bugs when using weapons (sometimes they work, sometimes they don't) and some control related issues. Certainly, this game is meant to be played on a gamepad, but there should be options for alternative controls as well. I tried to play it on a keyboard on my MacBook Pro and I can't say I liked the experience when it comes to controls... actually there are lots of things to gripe about, but again, this is an early alpha.\n\nIt does show promise and it really is reminiscent of Blackthorne in many ways (except BT was more natural to play on a keyboard). The atmosphere is definitely what I've would have wished for when it comes to gloominess and music, but in many ways many elements of the game (such as lockpicking) feel like placeholders for true mechanics - which is ok at this stage.\n\nThe game does have potential, but it's still far from a decent beta stage.","August 18, 2014","true","15.6"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","0"

The music, the visual style, the expansive maps, the combat and even the Matrix/cyberspace segments were all incredibly well realised, I loved the characters and I loved the world.\n\nIt's not a perfect game, it really isn't, sometimes poor animations, no clear indication of foreground and background separation and with pre and post release bugs that really put a dampener on the overall experience.. though the developers stepped up every time and worked their damnedest to fix them. The save system though, that truly is a mess and it took a long time with a truly confusing and nonfunctional part of it to just be flat out removed instead. Once you get to grips with the terrible save system (and this is a Unity game so saves are stored in registry too, so bad) and the foreground/background issues, you can find a true gem here.\n\nWhat the devs have crafted is now, and will remain always, a benchmark to me for 2D RPGs and cyberpunk worlds and I'm absolutely gutted that this is such an underutilised scenario.. there are just so few, if any, 2D scrolling RPGs like this and even fewer scifi/cyber ones, all I can hope is that the success of this encourages more developers to release games like this.... and it has to be said, the cyberspace implementation in this felt more intuitive and engrossing and enjoyable, than any I'd seen so far - outside of the Shadowrun SNES/MD versions. Even the, frankly magnificent, Shadowrun Returns series has incredibly lacklustre cyberspace segments in comparison.

I saw it at GDC Next 2014 at The MIX booth, where I got a review key for a broadcast on my channels. I don't think it was completely finished at that point, so I had my fun with it but put it on the shelf. I finally came back to it recently, and played through the full ~10 hours of gameplay offered in the span of a week, picking at it here and there when I could, often sitting and playing more than I really intended in any given sitting.\n\nI like Cyberpunk and there's a damn good reason - dystopian near-future where we are relying on modern technology while still struggling like the working class of really any era. Instead of cell phones and internet, it takes things a step up to cybernetic implants for medical aid, augmentation, pure aesthetics, and direct access to networks with a datajack in your brain. Even more, corporations have gotten so powerful that they have no qualms about overriding police and local laws to do whatever they want. All of this is represented quite well in Dex, and stays completely true to the style in every way.\n\nFor story, single play-through 10/10, and there's the option to save frequently in different slots so you can replay each branching decision as desired. There are a lot of NPCs giving quests, but instead of feeling like a stupid grind, you really have a feeling of wanting to help these folks and engage in the intrigue related to their request.\n\nGameplay gets 8/10. Some stiffness, some awkwardness, but I really like the perpetual AR layer and the hacking sections. I also liked that enemies never respawn unless an area is being repopulated, which is extremely rare. It means getting lost is no biggie because you are still making progress (even grabbing clues for later quests), and it also means that enemies aren't able to be farmed to pursue max level. I also didn't know there was a free DLC with 3 extra suits that have bonuses, which I easily would have gotten through gameplay if I'd included the DLC when I started. Combat itself mainly resorted to AR hacking enemies and using takedown for an instant kill, and for the two enemies that doesn't work on I either punch-and-roll or pull out the shotgun or SMG and close in for heavy damage. There are many ways to play the game, but I found a particular way to be rather effective. Also, all NPC interactions are considered in a box rather than a rectangle, so it is easy to exploit left and right screen edges but top and bottom are clipped relative to AI interactions. Melee weapons would have been nice, too.\n\nArt gets 9.5/10 - its beautiful, I just wish there were a few more frames for many of the animations to help smooth out some of the stiffness. Everything looks grimy and run-down, even in the nice areas, just as I'd expect for the style.\n\nAudio gets 8/10. The voice actingis great, and everything sounds the part, but the fidelity and overall quality of the sounds wasn't particularly memorable to me.\n\nI wish there was more of this game, or more in this environment. Very fun, very cyberpunk, definitely kept me playing. I also would have hoped for a bit more agency and choices mattering, as it seemed like many of my choices had the same result plus or minus a transaction or some extra experience. But that would have made it a much larger project - it would potentially still be in the works!\n\nAnd a little bit more, if you are interested.... but it is definitely spoilerish.\nLockpick 2 gets you into 90% of the game. I got that and Charisma up to level 2 ASAP, followed by AR. I dunno how much Charisma 2 actually helped me. Afterwards I went endurance for max implants, but I feel like the only purchased implants I needed were jump, gas resist, elec resist, and health regeneration, and the rest were just filler. AR 2 is key though, it lets you safely hack all cameras, sentry turrets, and enemies, with extremely low chance of sustaining focus damage. AR early, AR often, you technically don't ever need to take any damage from anything after AR 2 is unlocked.\n\nCrash's safe code is a pile of crap to solve. Its a very obscure code and clue - just look it up when you get to that point in the game. I never found Mr. Finch's safe code or clues either that I'm aware of, but I doubt what he had was important. When you get the final gun in the glass chamber, feel free to use it on all your non-takedown adversaries, as you'll find 5-6 magazines for it and likely not need every shot. The final battle really is as easy as it seems, just don't get bored and you'll eventualy get through it.","January 30","true","18.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

There's a lot of potential in the design but as it stands Dex is still a way off from being the immersive experience it promises.\n\nThe best aspect of the game currently is the environments; juxtaposing grime and gloom against neon and advanced  technology in the manner genre aficionados will know and love. It's a style which has become curiously nostalgic but it's thrilling nonetheless to see it realised so effectively in the side-scrolling format. There's plenty to explore, climb or break into even with much of the city still closed off and the main story/quest absent at present.\n\nSadly the general gameplay doesn't fare so well; as many have noted gunplay is severely imbalanced at present, with off-screen enemies chipping away at your health bar often making more challenging combat encounters frustrating and unfair. Hand to hand fighting is much better but is still hampered by the imbalances and the fixed control scheme.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that the experience is frequently marred by the plethora of current bugs. I was stopped from exploring one building completely as I got stuck in the doorway, while I've also had guns disappearing or requiring reloads in-spite of a full clips.\n\nDialogue could use some polish too being riddled with grammatical errors and bizarre wording, it's a small gripe but another area where I find my immersion being broken. If the game is to deliver on its story heavy focus the delivery is key.\n\nThe bottom line; as an early access title none of this should be particularly surprising. What's in place is looking very good and I'm sure the rough edges will be tidied up in ensuing updates.  I'd recommend it on this promise alone but with the caution that at present much remains to be delivered and that frustration is still a little too frequent for this build to be enjoyable.\n\nRegardless,  cyberpunk enthusiasts should keep an eye on this one. I'm sure the support will be well worth it in the long run.\n","August 24, 2014","true","12.9"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

I don't know if it was because of the ending, or the game itself. Let's just start with the gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay handles as well as you would expect an Action-RPG Sidescroller, but then it can shift into some BULLET-HELL STUFF WHERE YOU'RE IN THE NETWORK. Whenever the game shifted into the bullet-hell gameplay, I felt the game was slowing down. I was bored and it was tedious. Thankfully, during the main story it isn't required all too often. The controls however, were a little clunky. If you try to aim straight down below you, the screen would just make a teleportation maneuver and bring you to the side of the screen. Your cursor would stay where it was.\n\nThe graphics are pixelated, so think Metal Slug, but with a lot more pixels. The cutscenes are still images that are like a slide show. With a bit of animation.\n\nThe story at the end was a bit confusing, but the game does give a bit of a twist, so hey there's that at the end.\n\nSo all in all, was this game good?\nYes\nIs it worth 19.99 USD full price?\nSadly, no.

One bug though that I encountered is the save bug where if I save in an area and I load some progress in the story did not seem to be saved but it was not like it was hours lost, just a single conversation or so but personally I expected something because this is an indie game.

The preview videos showed what looked like a very exciting game, one that caters to my interests, but the reviews were highly mixed. I chalk it up to two possible reasons. One, people might have been playing a buggier, early version, and two I think this game caters to a certain demographic.\n\nI played the post-May 22nd version, 2.0.2.4, I believe. While it still has some bugs, they weren't anything too distracting, showing up in only a couple of spots.\n\nAs for the demographics, I grew up on games like Flashback on the original Playstation. When I saw this game, that was the first game to come to mind. I highly enjoyed Flashback; it's one of the few games that I played through on each difficulty level. For those who like Flashback, I highly recommend this game. It has much of the same mechanics and feel, as a side-scrolling sci-fi with a compelling story line.\n\nThis game also conjurs up memories of Abuse. The game's choice to shoot with the mouse and move with the keyboard mimics Abuse, but only in cyberspace can you do both at the same time.\n\nAnd, finally, there's Beneath A Steel Sky. These games share themes, and perhaps quantity of dialog.\n\nSpeaking of dialog, this game's hired top notch voice actors. The woman who voiced Miranda is incredible, in my opinion. Though, there are certain points where the actors didn't know how to pronounce some of the words, and I don't think that was intentional.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic, if you like this style. It fits right at home with the aformentioned games in that regard. Dex's animations are very fluid. The music is great, and was never annoying. The muisc would change as you got into a combat situation ala Flashback.\n\nProbably the thing I least liked about this game was the ending. But, I had enjoyed playing so much that I can't dock it too many points. It wasn't the goal, but the journey that I liked, and that is as much as anything the mark of a good game.","June 6, 2015","true","23.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

That already checks quite a few boxes for being unique. Like it's inspiration, it shares action gameplay in the form of melee, ranged and some minor stealth with RPG elements. It also features a hacking minigame in the form of a twinstick shooter, and some minor platforming. You level up and can spend your points to raise your offensive and defensive capabilities and also some utility stuff like picking locks or convincing people of your ideas. You can freely explore most of the world and there are many great sidequests which are all voiced and often offer a multitude of outcomes.\n\nNow, you can see that this game is ambitious as ♥♥♥♥! Just from what I said it sounds like the Deus Ex 2D, and it comes pretty close to it actually. Sadly, which is the biggest gripe I have with the game, it lacks a lot of polish. Levels are sometimes too dull, ranged combat feels not very rewarding, the skills could need more balancing, the stealth is poorly implemented and enemies can be tricked out in various ways. Melee combat gets messy all around and AR is too much of a hassle to use. The hacking gets dull very quickly and feels often too forced, enemies can see you as soon as you enter a room if you are unlucky, the saving system is partially punishing. There are bugs, the animations often look pretty lackluster, the art quality is fluctuating sometimes, some musicpieces get dull or repeat badly, the sfx got way too few work and sounds painful, the special effects are miniscule or unfulfilling, the main protagonist lacks charater throughout the whole game being between a completely silent character or a quirky, smack-♥♥♥ girl, the main storyline lacks cohesion and the major plotpoints lack power.\n\nIt has many issues, and you can see that the game was just way too ambitious for such a small indie studio, and therefore is a very rough experience all around. But, in the end, it IS THE 2D DEUS EX of games, or comes as far to it as no other game before. It could have been an all around amazing game with a lot more polish and reworking of some gameplay-systems and lines, but it would have probably never seen the light of day if it tried. But one can see what it tries to do, and finds in between the rough edges an extremely promising game, that realizes what many other games or developers are too scared of, which is too far away from mainstream to find large publicity, but which has the insight and background to create a experience for people willing to delve into it and see the shining spots.\n\nSo, ye, basically if you like 2D-action games with story, rpg-elements and a cyberpunk scenario, and the many small quirks don't hinder you to enjoy the better parts, I can wholeheartedly recommend to you.","November 24, 2015","true","19.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Much as others have said, this is like a Deus Ex in 2-D.  The graphics, though pixelated are very good. The combat system, while a tad awkard at first to master, leaves you feeling like a ninja at the end when you insanely powered up. (Invest in your xp and mods!) The music is good, memorable and comparable to Deus Ex. The background and story is fairly rich, but could use more I feel. A few things that drove me nuts: Dex's cutscene face/self was gorgeous as was her voice acting.. But your character's pixel self you play as.. All I could see was a man's face. I know, it's a peeve really, and it doesn't take away from gameplay but its one of those things that annoyed me. Some blue lips on the pixel character like the cutscene face would have fixed this. If not, you get to hide her face with the DLC costumes you can get. The quests were fairly engagin and not uber repetitive.. at least as story involved with them, They werent generic. However, there is one quest that the way they set it up made me (and a number of others I found) wonder if it was a broken quest by a bug. It's not. I will simply say you need to go back wayyyyy to the beginning to finish it. Good luck on that one.  Lastly, and this annoyed me to no end: One of the DLC costumes you get renders you invisible. I'm not sure if it was this or something else, but when I came out of invisibility, I was unable to physically interact (beat the sh!z) out of the enemies... but they could beat me down. I could only fix this by saving my game and exiting to the main menu. I have a fast PC so i was able to do this quickly but it was just annoying. These are my only gripes. This was an amazingly fun game for its look and price. I'm considering giving it another run with my 'skills' i developed handling my character and building up again. :D 9/10","February 15","true","17.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The writing and atmosphere have been interesting so far.  I like the world but the problems with the game are a bit too much for me to want to continue with it. I would definitely watch the game as if the issues could get fixed it seems it could be a lot of fun.\n\nThe save system is incredibly frustrating.  The amount of progress I have lost in this game even only playing for an hour has been more than I want to put up with.  I've died a few times to places where I thought I could jump because of the art but turns out what I thought was a ledge wasn't or I miss calculated how far I could jump.  Normally this would be fine but with the save system I go back really far.  I will sometimes have whole quests to go back through.  This by itself is enough that I can't imagine trying to stick with the game until there are some changes (if that is even possible).\n\nAlso the combat feels a little not quite right.  When I jump over enemies they seem confused on what to do.  Early on at least the fighting just doesn't feel great.  The controls have also not seemed intutive with me having to switch from my controller over to my mouse for a few things like equipping items to my quick item slots (although I'm guessing there may be a way to do this it wasn't obvious how).  EDIT: I tried a new play through with a keyboard mouse set up.  For the most part this felt much better except for I had trouble interacting when using the virtual reality ability in the real world.  For some reason I couldn't use the interact button and had to use the Y button on my controller instead.  Otherwise keyboard/mouse felt better by far for the control scheme.  Things like aiming your gun feel better with a mouse and it was much easier to use quick item slots.","May 9, 2015","false","3.5"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","18","31","0","0"

I'll be the first to admit that you might still occasionally run into them - for example, every seller I interacted with stole whichever item I had in the first slot of my inventory. I just put a quest object with no value in that slot and played on, but it did cost me a couple of expensive things until I figured it out. Apart from that, there are no game-breaking bugs anymore, and the gameplay itself is very logical and smooth.\n\nThe atmosphere is the best thing about the game. The voice acting brings every NPC to life, and it's really good, top-quality voice-acting that you don't often get in any game, leave alone a retro 2D RPG. Open world claims are absolutely valid - I wouldn't say the map is too big, but it feels rather realistic, multi-layered, with a number of hidden quests and locations, a lot of connected stories and feuds you can dig into, and you can explore it in any way you like. I haven't tried a 100% non-lethal playthrough, but it seems possible, as is focusing on diplomacy and stealth, or hacking and guns (guns - not recommended, as many have said before me, but you might need them to break security systems a couple of times, so keep one just in case).\nThe main plot is, as it often happens, a little less engrossing than the city and its inhabitants with the side quests, but it's a decent big cyberpunk story. Don't come here looking for something extremely original - it's more of a love letter to the genre, but well-executed, throught through and with characters you do (sometimes, unfortunately) care about.\nAll in all, very much recommended. I got it with a discount, but felt that I've gotten enough content for my money at the third hour of playthrough, and it took me 19 hours to carefully explore everything the game had to offer.","July 23, 2015","true","19.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Character progression, story line and side quests with multiple solutions included, it allow to use different playstyles and do moral choices, it have hidden places and paths that gave good oldschool exploration pleasure. 4 endings.

Around 15-18 (it was 28 for me, completionist's run with revisiting all locations with search for hidden stuff) hours to complete.\n\nGame have some rough edges though and require some time to full sinking: arcade style melee/shoot combat (melee goes much more interesting with skill progression), crimsonland-alike "augmented reality" and "cyberspace" modes lacks of hints: 1, 2 and 3 on keyboard selects different software, I accidentally found it when had ~70% of game finished.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dslucia1/recommended/269650/","dslucia1","dslucia1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dslucia1/","262 products in account","TL;DR: It's pretty good. The cyberpunk theme is great, the characters are interesting and the narrative is not poorly-written, the soundtrack is lovely and very remiscent of old-school cyberpunk, and the combat, while a bit clunky, isn't expressly awful. If you're into action-RPGs and platformers and dig cyberpunk settings, check it out.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIt's difficult to look at Dex and not think of other, well-established examples of cyberpunk fiction. Harkening back to the old '80s and '90s aesthetic, the Blade Runner and Deus Ex inspirations are almost immediately apparent in both the visual style and gameplay progression that Dex takes and, when it it adheres to its inspirations, it is all the stronger because of that.\n\nDex is a 2D action-RPG with platforming elements and a heavy emphasis on freedom of choice. While not nearly as open as the aforementioned Deus Ex, Dex should feel familiar to veterans in more ways than simply by name. Punching, shooting, stealthing, hacking, and sometimes even talking are all viable solutions to the problems that the player is presented with throughout the course of the game, and in the style of older RPGs Dex takes a hard line at encouraging players to be the master of a single aspect or two rather than a Jack of all trades. While it wouldn't be impossible to play the game trying to evenly level your stats, there's high potential for making things more complicated than they need to be by doing so.\n\nThe game features both melee and ranged combat, though neither are as refined as they possibly could be. Punching feels stiff and limited as it roots Dex, the player character, to the ground for the duration of the attacking animation. It's fairly easy and smooth to transition into a dodge roll (by using the right analog stick; as I didn't use mouse & keyboard controls I unfortunately won't be able to inform on them) or blocking, but the complete lack of control combined with an auto-step that Dex does while punching makes melee combat take a while to get used to. Ranged combat, at least with a controller, doesn't fare much better, as aiming guns with the analog sticks is an exercise in extreme frustration. It's not something I would recommend trying while in the middle of a pitched fight, ironically, though I have the sneaking suspicion that it would be much easier to do with the mouse & keyboard controls.\n\nHacking is also a central gameplay mechanic. Dex can enter Cyberspace at any time by clicking down the left analog stick on the controller, or into mission-specific networks by finding computers around the game world. While in Cyberspace, the game changes into something of a twin-stick shooter, and unfortunately the control here isn't amazing either. You get a health bar, called Focus, and an Energy bar that is utilized for moving faster or using special attack software that you can find and use throughout the game, not unlike spell books in a fantasy RPG. But, unlike most twin-stick shooters I've played on the PC, Dex doesn't automatically fire while aiming in Cyberspace, and instead you need to hold a trigger button in addition. This doesn't sound like much of an inconvenience, but what seemed to be something like input or reception lag between turning and the fire rate while in Cyberspace made the entire experience feel incredibly grating and tiring. Leveling the hacking stat and discovering the Pulsewave software (switching through different software abilities can be done by pressing Left or Right on the controller D-Pad after you have multiple abilities) were boons for my playthrough and made it much more tolerable, though it also made me wish the hacking had simply been balanced more like that from the very beginning.\n\nI won't touch much on the story. It's nothing too new, but it does take a few interesting turns and it was compelling enough for me to follow it through without feeling bored. The characters are all fairly well-realized and given distinct personalities, and near enough every character you can interact with is one who is important for a side-quest. It's worth noting that the game has a large number of side-quests, most of which can be finished as soon as you're set loose on the city or ignored completely in favor of simply going through the (comparitively short) main quest. A few of the side-quests seemingly end without any hard conclusion upon completion, but the game actually accounts for that with something of a time-shift that occurs before the player starts the final "chapter", during which time the player can see new incidental environmental effects or follow up on what happened with specific characters. It's a nice touch, and one I wasn't personally expecting.\n\nThe soundtrack is also worth noting. As with the rest of the game, it pulls a lot of inspiration from older cyberpunk fiction. It's the type of familiar that is just different enough to evoke nostalgic feelings without being something old itself, and it fits the thematic setting phenomenally.

On the adventure side, the world of Dex is simply stunning. Every character and set piece is beautifully hand-drawn making RPG staples, like the weapon and item shops, ambient and memorable. There are a lot of really creative visual tricks used to make the city feel alive and populated. This alone is almost worth the price of admission. On the action side, the combat borrows from classic beat-em-ups during the Sega Genesis era. You'll use a variety of kicks and punches and a light assortment of weapons to take care of various baddies. It's not particularly mind-blowing, nor is it the main focus of the game, but I enjoyed after leveling to faceroll status and unlocking a few stat enhancing outfits.\n\nAlas, the hybridity of Dex also creates numerous challenges the game fails to tackle. The combat is inimical to the rest of the game. It's difficult and repetitive at the start. Like a Zen master who makes potential students wait for days on the stairs of the dojo before allowing them to train, Dex demands sacrifice before unfolding itself. After learning a few tricks, combat becomes so easy it is irrelevant, making the end of the game a drag. Moreover, the open world design betrays the adventure aspects. Often one will run into a random piece of equipment and add it to the inventory with no comment. Eventually you'll talk to a npc who will say something like, "Oh I wish I could go running if I just had shoes!" and your character will reply, "Oh good thing I picked up these dusty old running sneakers two maps ago!" As if completing a jigsaw puzzle where all the pieces are perfectly square, upon discovering a part, one sort of shrugs and goes "I guess this will fit in somewhere." I quickly found myself disengaged from the story and relentlessly smashing the interact button upon every npc encounter.\n\nNot to say the characters that make up the world of Dex are not engaging. They all have unique personalities and the game features a cast of more than twenty voice actors. What draws away from them is the banality of the story. I found the plot to be cliched, although it may be appealing to those experiencing the cyberpunk genre for the first time. Poor story telling is not always bad as long as it's sealed off from the gameplay, but I found the lack of innovation in the tale-telling to be infectious. Going the extra mile for secret intel should be rewarding, but most of the private information found through the hacking mini-game are email messages along the line of "Dear Boss: The SECRET PLAN is going according to schedule, and by the way, I killed all those INNOCENT PEOPLE you asked me to. Regards, John Henchmann" Story elements and some of the sprites are reused carelessly. It becomes insulting when you enter a base of anti-technology fanatics that is filled with the same cyborg toughs from every other stage, or have to reunite estranged family members for the third time.\n\nOne thing that is wholly unique in the cliched world of Dex is what I would explain as a genuine female lead. When I speak about a genuine female lead I want to draw a contrast between the major publishers' idea, which entails giving Super Soldier X an optional pair of breasts at character creation. Dex's gender is integral to the story. You'll meet a protective older man, male escorts who are obsessed with their enhanced members, and a pervy doctor who relishes the chance to have an unconscious babe on which to install cybernetic mods. These encounters made me uncomfortable as a male, but are assuredly archetypes of the everyday female experience. The empathy I experienced in these moments, though sadly not gained from the plot as a whole, is something rarely gleaned from the video game medium.\n\nIf you are looking for a solid adventure game with some combat wedged in, pick up Dex. If you are looking for a competent action sidescroller with a story, look elsewhere.\n","February 11","true","28.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

First of all, I would like to mention that I do recommend the game, but I must confess that I bought it a few days ago with a 50% discount (so, it costed me 10 bucks instead of 20). At full price, I really don't think that I would have recommended it.\n\nNow, I must start by making some unoriginal statements, that I am far from being the first one to make.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\nOverall, the story, dialogues, and NPCs, are good.\n\nSimilarly, the atmosphere is great, and all the backgrounds encountered during the course of the adventure are striking. The art style really immerses the player into this dystopian world wich consists mainly (but not only) of the city of Harbor Prime, and the music is fascinating.\n\nThe XP system is basic, but fine (it works), and the RPG feeling (multiple endings included) is real.\nTHE BAD:\n\nThe gameplay is not as fun or as smooth as it could have been (or as one could have hoped it would be), mainly because hand-to-hand combat (which is in my opinion the best fighting option in this game) is not really enthralling. Moreover, gunfights are soooooo boring, and the hacking part is also rather tedious (the hacking mini-game in Sly 4, which was similar in many ways, was far better IMHO).\n\nThe controls are far from perfect (in particular if you use the gamepad), and unfortunately the buttons on the gamepad cannot be remapped (although it is claimed to be the case -that's wrong-), while this would be reaaally useful.\n\nI found that the graphics for the different characters are not all as pretty as the ones for the background, which is a shame IMHO. Similarly, the animations are toooooo clunky (look at Dex while she moves stealthily on her knees, or while she climbs a ladder, and you will know what I am talking about).\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nAll in all, Dex is a rather enjoyable experience. The small budget feeling sometimes bursts in (considering what the game lacks, or what could have been highly improved), but what the games does well is a real pleasure for the player. It has a few remaining bugs here and there, but nothing game breaking (at least, for me -maybe I was lucky, though-).\n\nI did have some save issues, but each time I just had to load a slightly older temporary save (the game makes temporary saves fairly regularly) in order to deal with it. A lot of players criticize the save system (which, indeed, may not be the best one around), but you actually just have to get used to it. Once you are aware of the way it works, you can easily turn it to your advantage (to put it differently, just learn how to play Dex as it is; it's not so hard). Similarly, I did not have any crash during the game (I played for about 20 hours to finish the game and see the three endings, since I like to take my time when playing), but, again, maybe I was just lucky. However, it's true that some choices made during the game may lead to inconsistent situations. Here are two personal examples (with spoilers inside!):\n\n\n****** SPOILER ALERT ******\n\n1) Towards the end of the game, I chose to betray Raycast, and to reveal its true identity to Hammond (to be honest, I did not believe in Raycast anymore). Then, Hammond's answer was that they would get rid of Raycast. Then I immediately tried to check on Raycast, and it seemed that he has actually been killed or disabled, because I was not able to talk to him or to interact with him. However, when I broke into the mainframe, the virtual face of Raycast appeared in one corner of my screen, in order to "support" me... How was he able to do that? No idea!\n\n2) When I was in the "White Room" (the last room of the game), I tried to use the map of Harbor Prime, in order to see if I was able to use it or not (yes, I sometimes have strange ideas)... And, indeed, I was able to. So, while I was on board of an orbital space station, I was able to teleport to the Earth (and then had no ways to make the trip back to the station)... Interesting notion!\n\n****** END OF SPOILER ALERT ******\n\n\nBesides, while reading some reviews, I saw several reviewers saying that they sometimes got lost during the quests, and that there were not sufficient clues in the quests in order to be sure about where to go or what to do next. I usually easily get lost in games, but it never happened to me while I was playing Dex. So I guess that either these players are trolling, or they did not read the dialogues carefully enough.\n\nI also saw some reviewers saying that the combat system was penalizing, but I personally found that the game was rather easy (the combo endurance+melee+nanite blood infusion is unstoppable, and I did not even have to use my guns once during the game, except when I tried them to see how they worked).\n\nFinally, some people compare Dex to Flashback (the 1992 game), but I cannot agree. I already did not agree when I hadn't even played the game (just by looking at gameplay vids), and I still do not agree now. Dex is an open-world cyberpunk action-RPG, with lots of choices (especially during the dialogues) and customization options, in which the action part is played as a 2D platformer. It has a real hand-to-hand combat system (as imperfect as it can be), you can sneak past enemies, and you can use different types of guns. The platformer part is rather smooth, and you can make mistakes that are not always lethal. Flashback, on the contrary, is a sci-fi (not specifically cyberpunk, just sci-fi) adventure platformer, where the progression is fully linear, with few dialogues, no choices, no customization, no RPG elements, few NPCs, only one gun, no real hand-to-hand combat (you can simply use your gun to hit an enemy when he's close to you). Moreover, the platformer part is highly rigid, and any unnecessary move can quickly mean death. Actually, Flashback is IMHO closer to a puzzle-game than to an action-platformer during these phases. I can see why someone might find some similarity between the art style in Flashback and some (but not all, far from this) of the backgrounds in Dex, but that's about all I can see.\n\nFor me, Dex is closer to games like Shadowrun (both the 1993 SNES game and the 1994 Genesis game), or -obviously- Deus Ex. Actually, I see it as a blend between these two Shadowrun games (without the Shadowrun-specific features, of course), but where the action part takes the form of a platformer. The adventure and story parts are similar to the 1993 SNES game, while the RPG part is similar to the 1994 Genesis game. Undoubtedly, some features are very, very, very Shadowrun-y (electrical hands, dermal cyber-armor, nanite blood infusion, artificial limbs, mirrorshades implants, respirator, retinal targeting implant, etc.). But even when considering Dex this way, the low-budget constraint casts a shadow -again- (no no-cyber armors, few guns, no grenades, etc.). I also have tried the three endings, and one of them is really cheap (the Singularity ending), another one is slightly better but still too short ("Rule the Complex"), and the third one is just okay ("Destroy the Complex"). This is why, unfortunately, I keep on thinking that Dex is highly overpriced: 10 bucks would have been perfect (making it a 5 bucks deal during the Steam sales, which can attract indecisive gamers), but 20 is way too much. To summarize my advice: I definitely encourage you to buy and try Dex, but wait for a 50% -or more- discount (as I did).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/v_hazard/recommended/269650/","v_hazard","v_hazard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/v_hazard/","28 products in account","Dex is a dialogue driven, Combat RPG from the side view perspective (think 2-dimensional platformer like prince of persia). It's a rare game that embraces a purist William Gibson cyberpunk universe semi-direct from the 1980's. It uses a simple RPG system. It has no character creation, and a mildly inconsequential character leveling system. And unfortunately it's lacking in some of the better qualities of a platformer as well. Combat feels overly chaotic when using firearms and overly scripted when fighting hand to hand. However, it still succeeds in presenting a very entertaining cyberpunk RPG title.\n\nDex wastes no time in getting you into the action and lets you know exactly what kind of cyberpunk game this is going to be. Its an RPG with lots of reading, it's a corps vs hackers vs new gods known as AI science fiction story, and it's not going to guide you through solving each of it's numerous puzzle-like quests. After introducing the player to an intriguing main plot Dex then throws the player into the grimy crime riddled city of Harbor Prime, with barely a direction to go. So it does well to give you numerous side quests to perform while you search for answers and explore the extensive city. WIth it's endearingly homegrown voice overs and corny dialogue.\n\nThe city, Harbor Prime, needs a mention, because it's one of the highlights of this game and a great joy to see done so well. Dex uses 2 dimensional side view areas in a 3 dimensional city scape and it makes it feel natural. It's hard to explain in vague terms, but when you are in the Chinese Quarter district and you see the entrance for Taijo as a lit street market extending beyond the backdrop of a level, and then you see it represented in the top down view of the city map it makes perfect sense and it makes the city that much richer to explore.\n\nDex is lacking in a few prized elements of an RPG, such as class and gender open character creation. It also possesses platform game controls that are sometimes itself the challenge rather than the platform levels and enemies. Specifically combat becomes un-fun when you can't run and aim a firearm simultaneously. These shortcomings aren't enough to make me stop enjoying it, though. I really am enjoying Dex.","September 6, 2015","true","17.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

In 2015?  Credit for audacious anachronism, if nothing else.  IF this game had been made in the mid 90's, it would likely have been successful.  20 years later... I still had a great time.\n\nThere will inevitably be comparisons to Deus Ex, and with a certain amount of validity.  Being cyberpunk, Dex shares a lot of plot and thematic similarites.  Even in how the game is played shares a lot in common -- missions have mutliple approaches, character traits can can be customized per playstyle, and missions and story elements branch depending on player choices.  But in the 90's, that's how we played games.  Especially anything wanting to call itself an RPG.  It wasn't just a matter of picking which color you want at the end game.  If you wanted, you could go back and pick different branches and see what outcomes were offered.  To that end, Dex succeeds quite well.  I felt like I was back in my parents' den poking around on the 486.  Fortunately, no Dos4GW or Gravis TSR's to fight with.\n\nThe graphics and music and voice acting are quite well done.  The writing is better than a lot of games, as well.  As a sidescroller or action game, Dex doesn't really stand out.  But as a story driven rpg, and especially if you're nostalgic for the days when cyberpunk was the future, or if you're curious to what the previous generation of gamers grew up with, it's definitely worth a shot.","September 7, 2015","true","15.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

This game is hard to put down, but the decent save system is extremely important in such games and EE delivers just that you would expect in that department.\n\nPresentation\n\nThe character art is as great as in Shadowrun trilogy. The animation of talking heads may seem funny to some, but you get used to it and I was more listening and reading most of the time anyway.\nThe style of everything else (character sprites, enemies, environments, etc.) probably wouldn't be to everyone's taste. It reminds me of Residue, maybe it's the same artist. Overall the art is definitely not bad and there is an incredible amount of details, but it has that “dirty” look, so, I how said, it wouldn't be to everyone's taste. It's still better than Residue, though. The animations could use more frames, but they're also fine the way they are.\n\nSound / Music\n\nALL voice actors did a great job portraying their characters, 100% fit. Well, maybe except Holm, but there's a reason why he talks that way. Still, it feels like the actor didn't understand how his character should talk like.\nI always was waiting for actors finish their lines (except Holm). The voice acting is really, really good.\n\nThe music stays with you even if you're not in the game. The tunes are memorable and fit whatever is happening in the game perfectly. It's worth noting that they used the real orchestra to record the soundtrack.\nThe main theme strongly reminds me of the main theme in Deus Ex: Human Revolution and I'm kinda sure Dex theme was inspired by it.\n\nThe in-game sounds are fine and do the job. Although Dex could use a bit more sounds for jumping, she only has two of these “uh-oh” and it may get tiresome or funny when you jump a lot on your way to somewhere.\n\nStory\n\nCan't say that something original was brought to the table, you will see most cyberpunk tropes you could see in a cyberpunk media.\nWhat's important, is that HOW the story is told, and the storytelling is absolutely brilliant here, especially the dialogues. Each character is unique and talks and behaves accordingly to who they are, be it an Irish sailor or a fat nerd who spends all his time in the Internet. They all feel alive. Everything, from journal logs and item descriptions has the same quality of writing.\nConsidering it's a game from Czech company, it's a huge achievement, because it doesn't feel like the game was made by non-Native speakers. No mistakes, no typos, not even a little one.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game design here reminds me a lot about Deus Ex, well, as if it was mixed with some metroidvania (because the game is 2D). Many hidden spots and ways to approach the target, invest points in skills to be a trained melee fighter or a great gunner. However, hacking is a something you can't skip in this game, so be sure to invest in that skill as it would be really hard without upgrading it, especially the last boss.\n\nSpeaking of hacking, unlike many other cyberpunk games, it's made the way the arcade games in 80s were made, and it's great. You control a small spaceship-like sprite and shoot your way through the cyberspace. In my opinion, it's much fun than node hacking in Deus Ex: HR.\n\nThe choices you do throughout the game really matter, sometimes they even change the locations around you (besides BioTech scandal you can also bomb some locations twice in the game, which will change them forever).\nThere are three main endings, two of them depend entirely on what you did at the some point of the game.\n\nNow, the battle system. Another thing which won't be to everyone's taste. You get used to it though. The enemies have their own patterns which you quickly learn and react accordingly, it's all about reacting most of the time.\nI like screwing around enemies, jumping and running around, spamming that hit button to see if I hit anything this time.\nThe Takedown ability (silent kill from behind) is extremely important, it changes a lot the way you approach the enemies – learn their walking patterns, hack all cameras in the area and then take them  down one by one without a fight.\nSo does the evade rolling. If an enemy has a gun and you don't, you can quickly roll to him, land a jump kick which will make him fall down and then proceed with a series of punch combos).\n\nIt's a must play for fans of cyberpunk RPG games and it's quickly became one of my favourite games. It's the game where you want to find every secret, see all quest outcomes and main endings.

I'm writing this review based on the recently released "Enhanced Edition" of Dex, which seems to have fixed or addressed all the complaints I've read about the game.\n\nThis may not be the best indie game ever made, but it comes close in quite a few regards. Dex is a very worthy example of the "metroidvania" sub-genre, and I'd recommend it just on that basis. But it's also a nice addition to the cyberpunk genre as well. The story and characters aren't the most original—chances are, if you're a fan of the genre you've quite likely seen a few of its tropes before. However, it builds to four different endings with some interesting choices to be made heading there, and it was good enough to feature some twists that did genuinely surprise me and keep me excited for the ending all the way through.\n\nThis is supported by dialogue and even side-quests that are well-written and interesting, and to round that off, the voice acting is good, even all the way to the most tangential NPCs that have nothing to do with the main plot. The environments are really nice to look at, and the game mechanics are fluid and invite you to explore. I found myself sometimes backtracking just to listen to the background music or look at the loving attention to detail in the environments, even though there is a good fast-travel option.\n\nThe combat was sufficiently challenging, but I was disappointed that there's no extra difficulty above the normal, only an easier one. On the other hand, I was impressed by how the quests don't always hold your hand and point you where to go and what to do, leaving it to you to figure things out or explore more; something I've sorely missed in RPGs in the recent past.\n\nThe game has two noteworthy issues. One: it's a bit rough around the edges when it comes to explaining some game mechanics, and I had to look up in the options menu to figure out the controls of certain actions—not a terrible shortcoming, but a bit unusual in this day and age. The other issue is that, as of writing this review, the controller support is going to be hit and miss due to an update in the Unity engine that blindsided the developers and broke controller support of this game. The game devs are working on a fix, but right now, it's a matter of luck if you can use your controller or not, and that even includes the normally trustworthy XBOX360 gamepad. (I can say though that I played through the entire game with the keyboard and mouse controls, which were surprisingly good for a game in this genre.)\n\nThe length is good too: it will take you about 12 hours to see one ending, and easily around 20 if you want to see all of the endings, complete every side-quest, try out everything else, and hunt down every achievement.\n\nThis is an easily overlooked gem, and if you're itching for a good metroidvania or cyberpunk game, I recommend it. If both of those things sound like they'd appeal to you, I'd highly recommend it.","October 14, 2015","true","25.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It calls to mind the classic MetroidVania style of play, while still reminiscent of the higher-quality flash games you might have enjoyed on NewGrounds.\n\nThe Plot\nAs Dex, a blue-haired woman in the megaplex of Harbor Prime, you wake up to a voice on the phone warning you of an imminent, seemingly-unprovoked attack by a corporate security team. You use abilities you never knew you had to escape, beginning a journey to the depths of the city's labrynthine underworld to it's dizzying heights of corporate corruption.\n\nHow It Plays\nThe graphics are splendid. Zooming in and out can reveal the detail given to every sprite or the scope of the cityscape, which calls to mind the urban decay of Blade Runner and the alien opulence of Gibson. Animations are smooth. The cutscenes are stylized scenes instead of actual animations, but given the scope of the game, it's not unreasonable, and still easy to look at.\n\nThe sound is good. Ambients, a great OST, it holds up to spec and surpasses necessity more often than not.\n\nThe controls are simple. I can imagine using an SNES controller with no difficulty to play this. I use a keyboard and had no difficulties.\n\nLeveling up is intuitive and simple. XP lets you improve four major skill branches (Endurance, Melee, Firearms, Hacking) and four minor ones (Lockpicking, Social, Barter, and AR). Credits, gear, inventory system (You'll never run out of room or hit a weight limit, which is nice), and after a quest, cybernetic upgrades.\n\nMost of the game is played from the meatspace perspective of a 2D side-scroller. Many areas cannot be explored until the appropriate Lockpicking skill or cybernetic upgrade is installed (toxin filter, super-jumps, electricity immunity, etc), but it never impedes game progress if you don't explore these nooks and crannies. You'll want to, though.\n\nThe other end of the game is a kind of hacking minigame in cyberspace, much like an old Asteroids space shooter. You can upgrade your hacking abilities in a number of ways, along with stealing cash and data, opening doors, and discovering more of the plot.\n\nIn between these is AR, manipulating the net in meatspace, which you and only you can do (One reason you're so damn special). A little trickier, but worth it.\n\nComplaints\nThe inability to make your own hero is more of a personal complaint, and is mitigated by Dex being an interesting and good-looking character.\n\nThe VO isn't is the best. Some characters like Decker are well voiced, but many of the actors sound like they are reading words they don't know how to pronounce, or different people will pronounce the same name differently.\n\nWhere these two meet is the fact that Dex is, herself, only voiced in cutscenes. If they're going to pigeonhole us into one character, why give her a voice so rarely? Given the long stretches between cutscenes, I began to feel detached from Dex. She was just the instrument of my will, and not a character I was following or investing in.\n\nA small complaint, but why does the electrical immunity implant give me immunity to environmental electricity, but not electrical attacks?\n\nConsidering the sheer amazement and import AR seems to have with your character, I'm quite surprised how rarely it came up as a play mechanic.\n\nThe Verdict\nI couldn't put it down for three days. It's not super-duper long, but it was a very entertaining ride. I've paid $20 for less fun by far, and I'm sure I'll play it again with a new build. Some of the side missions aren't always winnable, and I'd like to see if I could have gotten a happier ending. Let's say, 8.5/10.","May 11","true","8.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tobsol/recommended/269650/","tobsol","Tobias Solem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tobsol/","321 products in account","Dex is a retro-style platform RPG with a strong cyberpunk theme. By retro I don't mean NES/8-bit era, which I essentially think is overhyped and generally pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but the more stronger part of the 16-bit era with parallax scrolling, strong beautiful pixel graphics (which utilizes 256+ colors) and animation. Dex suffers from a few obvious issues, the control scheme being one; controlling the protagonist is often frustrating to dumb, and the animations, while decent sometimes work to your disadvantage (ie. slower animations than your reaction time) making it feel a bit clunky at times. On top of that the game suffers from a broken savegame-mechanic where you find yourself having to do some pretty annoying "avoid drops of certain death"-levels, dying at the end of them and having to do it all over to some pretty non-user friendly skill systems, it isn't always crystal clear how and what you are supposed to do, and the quest log isn't always helpful.\n\nWith that said, the backstory, the level design, and the atmosphere and characters in the game make it stand out as a title, if you like cyberpunk games, this is a surprisingly enjyable title with several subquests and opportunities to delve into the world. If you can get over some of the indie-clunkiness you have a strong RPG-gem here. Game takes 8-14 hours to complete.","July 16, 2015","true","13.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I am a big fan of Deus Ex-Human Revolution and this is a good 2-D take on that!\n\nGood price, good gameplay, good graphics.

It does a great job of combining your physical actions with hacking and crafts a unique experience. As a cyberpunk fan, this game was one of the best I've played.\n\nIt does have a slow and frustrating start. Combat is clunky, guns are deadly, and a very awkward save sytem.  But the gameplay  opens up once you have a few skills and cyberware options. It still has it's moments, but overall I enjoyed the hell out of it.\n\nBut, it really isn't balanced for mutliple styles of play. Certain skills are required to continue in the game and certain skills are borderline useless. Even worse, one path pretty much turns Dex into a freaking Goddess that breaks the game. There was no longer combat only slaughter.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it felt good to be a living cheat code for a while, but it was waaaay overpowered.\n\nI tend to pay games for short periods and move on, but Dex wasn't one of them. I got busy and moved on but I couldn't stop thinking about it until I finished it.

First of all: this game is WAY too short. I don't mean that in a "not worth the money, you pay for only a little teaser" sense. I mean that by the time you finish the game you're very, very much wanting more. More plot, more story, more action... "leave them wanting more," and this game does that.\n\nExcellent musical score, interesting stylized graphics, and the gameplay is extremely retro - evocative of the 16 bit era. Except that unlike so many other games, "retro" doesn't mean "uninspired attempt to appeal to nostalgia to get away with a lackluster product," but rather "everything that was good in games like Blackthorne and Shadowrun, but refined by advances made since the days of the Genesis and SNES." I hope to see more of this game series, or from this studio, in the future.","January 3","true","20.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls are side-on, and you platform around like Another World or Flashback, but the gameplay is modernized with some stealth possibilities and lots of different ways to develop your character. I love that you can solve certain missions with dialog options if you choose; outside of graphic adventures this is quite rare. As usual for me, i found the shooting a little tedious (in particular the bullet hell hacking minigame), so it may be a little too twitchy for a pure adventure fan. But despite that, and although the main storyline isn't going to win any originality awards, the characters are so charming and the world is so well-developed that the city is delight to explore. There's more going on here than i would expect from an indie game. Very nice surprise.","January 4","true","15.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Thankfully, the enhanced version fixed most of those, so I'm happy to change my review to a glowingly positive one, now that I have completed the game!\n\nWhat an awesome and innovative approach to both platformers and RPGs! I've never seen anything like it. Gorgeous visuals, refreshing and original art style. True cyberpunk experience, with a well executed storyline, immersive atmosphere and insanely good voice acting. Surprisingly smart and challenging level design with non-linear flow, too. There's really not much left to ask for. Maybe only for smarter enemies that have more combat manoeuvres.\nAll in all, a wonderful game more than worth its full price.

First of all: this game is WAY too short. I don't mean that in a "not worth the money, you pay for only a little teaser" sense. I mean that by the time you finish the game you're very, very much wanting more. More plot, more story, more action... "leave them wanting more," and this game does that.\n\nExcellent musical score, interesting stylized graphics, and the gameplay is extremely retro - evocative of the 16 bit era. Except that unlike so many other games, "retro" doesn't mean "uninspired attempt to appeal to nostalgia to get away with a lackluster product," but rather "everything that was good in games like Blackthorne and Shadowrun, but refined by advances made since the days of the Genesis and SNES." I hope to see more of this game series, or from this studio, in the future.","January 3","true","20.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls are side-on, and you platform around like Another World or Flashback, but the gameplay is modernized with some stealth possibilities and lots of different ways to develop your character. I love that you can solve certain missions with dialog options if you choose; outside of graphic adventures this is quite rare. As usual for me, i found the shooting a little tedious (in particular the bullet hell hacking minigame), so it may be a little too twitchy for a pure adventure fan. But despite that, and although the main storyline isn't going to win any originality awards, the characters are so charming and the world is so well-developed that the city is delight to explore. There's more going on here than i would expect from an indie game. Very nice surprise.","January 4","true","15.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It matters where and when you spend your skill points as you will not be able to max out everything.\n\nThe game is also plot driven and you will be hooked until the end. It’s not too long (I beat it in about 20 or so hours in two sessions) which for me is a plus because I don't like it when games drag on forever just to take your time for no reason, so it never feels like a grind and I was hooked from start to the end.\n\nFinally the artwork just works: the colors convey the cyberpunk mood perfectly, so does the music. The animations are fluid and beautiful. The voice acting is spectacular: all the characters are voiced by different voice actors and they all did an amazing job.\n\nSo all in all it’s an amazing game, that won't take your life away and will leave you wanting more.\nI will be looking forward for Dex 2.","December 29, 2015","true","20.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would wait a few months to play it though.  Its very buggy, and some of the bugs can actually impede further progress in the game.  The most serious ones were fixed today, but some still exist.  The game itself is set in a dystopian future with copious amounts of drugs, computer hacking, and corporate abuse of power.  The combat system supports melee, guns, and hacking into opponents implants, and all three options are viable.  This is not a stealth game, but the stealth elements are well done, especially if you buy the implant to see enemies field of view.

And I would say the ambition just about outweighs the flaws. It comes across like it was developed by a group with a whole lot of talent, vision and enthusiasm, but short on experience and an eye for detail (not to mention time and money). Y'know, like this was only their second game or something...\n\nThe TL;DR of it is I enjoyed the game in spite of its problems. I'm glad I gave Dreadlocks some cash, and if they make something else I'd definitely give them more just to see what they do next. Given the massive difference from their first game ("Rune Legend" - thanks Wikipedia) to this one it's clear they had no intention of staying in their comfort zone and I think that justifies some of the mis-steps and certainly deserves some respect. The game has a cubic assload of atmosphere, the world feels cohesive, and of course you get to be a street-fighting, gun-toting cyborg, which has never yet been a bad thing. Well, except Robocop. Being Robocop has always looked like it would suck.\n\nThe biggest problems for me weren't even those bugs and niggles of a small inexperienced developer, but the ones Dex shares with it's AAA brothers and sisters - not least the ongoing problem of how to make hacking work in a game. Here it's a low-rent shmup, and while it isn't *bad* as a game mechanic it really struggles when it's expected to carry some fairly dramatic moments in the story, especially when (spoiler? ish?) it also has the recent Deus Ex's problem of reducing huge choices about the fate of your character and all of humanity down to a question of which button you push and a quick cut-scene.\n\nAdd to that the lacklustre and anticlimactic "boss fight" with the GSV-2 and Dex is in good company with the likes of Bioshock and-don't-think-I-can't-see-you-skulking-back-there-Half-Life-2-I-don't-care-if-it's-been-over-a-decade-I-will-never-ever-forgive-you. Cough. Luckily Dex still had a fair bit left to go at that point so isn't quite the spanner in the works that it could be. I guess my point is that if I'll let games from experienced developers with buckets of cash off for dropping the ball like that then I'll sure as hell forgive Dex and co when I definitely enjoyed the overall experience.","May 19, 2015","true","14.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Every single level has specific details that make them unique and rememberable.  You have an inventory, quests, a map, augmentations, multi-choice and well voiced dialogs, skills, experience points, and hacking.  There are a few cons to get over but overall the game is definitely worth your money and time.\n\nSome minor cons to expect:\n- Enemies can sometimes be deadlocked in unarmed combat.  A well experiecned player can get away with hacking, using their hands as a weapon, and not use a single bullet.\n\n- You have to spend skill points first to even be able to equip and use a machine gun or shotgun.\n\n- The AR hacking is basically a mini-game that becomes real mundane and excessive over time.\n\n- Saving is only done entering a stage.

Train yourself with the controls, particularly when using a controller. You may even find that your fists work more efficiently over any gun you come across.\n3) Be wary of your surroundings.

The game world is very well realized and really nails the gritty cyberpunk feel. Most of the characters are well done and fit their surroundings. Also the art style and soundtrack in Dex are spot on.\n\nGameplay-wise Dex is pretty solid and provides enough variety when making your way through the game. Only real complaints about the gameplay are the lackluster gunplay and the some what boring hacking scenes. The story is good enough to justify the gameworld although nothing mindblowing. Also some of the story concepts might remind bit too much of Gibson's Neuromancer, but that is a minor complaint.\n\nAll in all Dex is a great achievement considering there is a small indie studio behind it. It is also probably the closest thing to Neuromancer I have ever played.","May 17, 2015","true","13.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And I would say the ambition just about outweighs the flaws. It comes across like it was developed by a group with a whole lot of talent, vision and enthusiasm, but short on experience and an eye for detail (not to mention time and money). Y'know, like this was only their second game or something...\n\nThe TL;DR of it is I enjoyed the game in spite of its problems. I'm glad I gave Dreadlocks some cash, and if they make something else I'd definitely give them more just to see what they do next. Given the massive difference from their first game ("Rune Legend" - thanks Wikipedia) to this one it's clear they had no intention of staying in their comfort zone and I think that justifies some of the mis-steps and certainly deserves some respect. The game has a cubic assload of atmosphere, the world feels cohesive, and of course you get to be a street-fighting, gun-toting cyborg, which has never yet been a bad thing. Well, except Robocop. Being Robocop has always looked like it would suck.\n\nThe biggest problems for me weren't even those bugs and niggles of a small inexperienced developer, but the ones Dex shares with it's AAA brothers and sisters - not least the ongoing problem of how to make hacking work in a game. Here it's a low-rent shmup, and while it isn't *bad* as a game mechanic it really struggles when it's expected to carry some fairly dramatic moments in the story, especially when (spoiler? ish?) it also has the recent Deus Ex's problem of reducing huge choices about the fate of your character and all of humanity down to a question of which button you push and a quick cut-scene.\n\nAdd to that the lacklustre and anticlimactic "boss fight" with the GSV-2 and Dex is in good company with the likes of Bioshock and-don't-think-I-can't-see-you-skulking-back-there-Half-Life-2-I-don't-care-if-it's-been-over-a-decade-I-will-never-ever-forgive-you. Cough. Luckily Dex still had a fair bit left to go at that point so isn't quite the spanner in the works that it could be. I guess my point is that if I'll let games from experienced developers with buckets of cash off for dropping the ball like that then I'll sure as hell forgive Dex and co when I definitely enjoyed the overall experience.","May 19, 2015","true","14.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/269650/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","Enter the world of a cyberpunk future as a girl named Dex, who in all outward appearance seems like your average person, but the shadow organization that truly rules the world has decided to try to take her out. You will have to use your hacker skills, fend off attackers with hand to hand combat as well as with guns.\n\nIn Dex, by Dreadlocks Ltd, you will find that through your experiences and how you deal with situations you will be given skill points that you can then distribute to fit your gaming style. Do you like to be a little bit more hardcore when it comes to hacking? Well put your skill points towards that. Do you want to be deadly with your hands and body when it comes to taking on opponents? Well put skill points into Melee. There's also so many more aspects that you can add your points towards. There's also the augmentation of your body with cybernetics to allow you to have more life, recover life over time, jump higher, become immune to electricity or poisonous gas, and much, much more.\n\nGraphically I kind of digged the whole vibe of the game it is a side to side scroller, sure there are doors and areas that are in the background that you can enter into, but at all times you are going to be moving left to right in areas. There are load screens for each areas, but I kind of looked the other way because that's how the game saves.\n\nSpeaking of saving your game, and this is one of my biggest gripes about the game is that you can pull up the control menu and at the top of the screen it shows you want to hit to SAVE, but in reality its has nothing to do with saving, its actually where you would go to load your game. So BE WARNED, you might really ♥♥♥♥ yourself off with that one, that I did a couple of times.\n\nThere are definitely quite a few side-quests that you're going to want to take on, and many of them do fall in the category of go over there and get me this, but to be honest there's enough action going on when you actively take on the quest that I didn't really mind, there was a bit of story to it so it wasn't mindless.\n\nOne of my biggest issues with games is that when you have voice acting you half ♥♥♥ it, with this game, I'm happy to report that they did nothing of the sort. The voice acting definitely brought my closer in to the game, and it definitely enhances the experience. There might have been a little bit of stereotyping with at least one character (cough cough TONY), but other than that I had no issue with how the actors voiced their characters.\n\nNow one of the things that is hard to do is to have a RPG that actually changes as you make choices, and there a couple of choices that can change the path of the game, some of the choices have a HUGE impact on how everything plays out, but I don't want to give anything away.\n\nIn all honesty this is a solid game, would I have like to do more hacking in the game? Absolutely. Would I have like a little bit of a more drawn out ending? Definitely. The thing is the overall game is good, and I enjoyed it. I did get my ♥♥♥ handed to me a couple of times in areas where the auto turrets became activated, but hey you live and learn. There are secrets in this game if you are willing to look for them, and I have to say that I am more than willing to recommend this game to you.

The game is rough around the edges and contains a few glitches and even a bug here and there.\n- There is a game breaking bug regarding saves after a certain point in the game\n- As of now you cannot rebind some keys\n- The interface is a bit obtuse. To use guns, drag them to the bottom inventory row, then draw them by pressing the assigned number.\n- The game saves checkpoints whenever you switch levels. The manual save function only copies the last checkpoint, it doesn't save the current game state. It's ok if you know about it, but the game doesn't explain this and you can thus lose progress.\n- The game actually contains two games. The overworld and the cyberworld. The cyberworld is a pretty mundane shooter/puzzler.\n\nWith that out of the way let me explain why I recommend this game.\n\n- The writing is pretty good (for a computer game). The world is well thought out, there are some well-written characters, you can read emails and newspaper articles with interesting background information.\n- The quests contain a surprising amount of choice and consequence. You can miss a lot of quests or outcomes by playing unattentively.\n- The core game loop of traversing hazardous levels, fighting and hacking is fun\n- Character attributes are pretty rudimentary but about half of the upgrades unlock new skills or abilities (the other half are percentages/number upgrades)\n- Apart from upgrading by increasing your attributes, you can also purchase implants. Many implants are meaningful and open up new ways\n- The level design is well done. It's still a 2D game, but there are secrets that you only uncover by following clues and using the above-mentioned implants\n\nAll in all, the game is simply fun. Once the bugs are patched, this will be a full recommendation. For now I recommend the game with reservations.","May 9, 2015","true","14.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I haven't encountered hardly any bugs, and certainly nothing game breaking (Windows 7, 64).  Save system should be better,  UI should be more dynamic on a gamepad (equpping items requires keyboard and mouse), but these are small complaints in what is otherwise an excellent and engaging action-adventure  game.\n\nWriting is good.  Spoken dialog is refreshing with actors & actresses, taking their time to inflect accents, and emotions.\n\nLots of outcomes are determined from choosing various lines of dialog during the game's many conversations.\n\nCool side missions, that aren't always fetch quests, have multiple phases, and often involve several characters.\n\nGame is pretty progressive by virtue of having a female, bi-sexual lead character.  Also the game doesn't shy from the seediness of creating a convincing urban dystopia.\n\nMusic, is uniformly great.  Moody, dark, and atmospheric.  Perfect blend of organic and synthetic.  Dirty, gritty, lived-in sort of feel to it all.\n\nUpgrades to your character add a 'metroid-vania' aspect to the whole experience.  New abilities mean access to new areas.\n\nThe hacking mini-game wont win any awards, but compare to hacking games from AAA titles, and it is clearly more engaging, than the average.\n\nOverall just a great experience that harkens back to old PC Adventure gaming, but with added benefits of tight combat and a dynamic movement system.","May 11, 2015","true","44.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If any one single aspect was done better... it'd be a really amazing game. With that said, its a solid playable title as is, and still pretty enjoyable. It does a good job at everything it does, all the styles it tackles, but good in like a 7 out of 10 kinda way. It's just no system, rpg or combat, is as complex as you would hope.

The world seems alive, the colouring and atmosphere is intense and it feels like you're actually in this world. For the platforming, it's actually really solid, something that I'll admit, didn't expect at all.\n\nLots of people compare this to Deus Ex with good reason. There are choices and consequences that help or upset the balance throughout the playthrough. Eventhough I haven't finished it yet, it's deffinatly worth the effort for anyone that likes to have choices, consequences, great visuals and so far, a good storyline.\n\nThere is, however, one thing that gets on my nerves, simply because the console versions have it and for some reason, the PC version doesn't: A save function.\nThe autosaves are only whenever you enter a 'big' area (or hub) and thus, not smaller ones. I've been doing a whole series of quests, been ported from 1 'big area' to another and it didn't save. I died after 30 minutes of finishing up the quest, then found myself all the way back at another 'big area' and thus losing 30 mins of my game.\nI went around this 'issue' by walking off the screen so it saves, then get back in. But why is there a save function on the consoles and not on the PC?\n\nOther than that, combat seems clunky and takes a lot of getting used to. For some reason, I take way too much damage, from certain enemies, then none at all because the enemy just flees.\n\nStill, despite the above mentioned gripes, this is a very solid and atmospheric 2d action/adventure/roleplaying game that's already begging for a second playthrough while not even being done with it yet.\nNot going to give it a score as those are redundant, but it's definitly high up in the top of 'really nice games'.\n\n\nThis is an edit - I'm not going to delete half the comment or use strikethrough.\nThere now IS a safe feature, after the recent update, which is a huge plus.\nThanks to the developer to keep supporting the game!","July 14, 2015","true","20.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I've had it since early beta. I thought it sounded interesting so  I picked it up on sale. At that time you could'nt really do much.

I was a little disapointed so I just forgot about it till a few days ago.\nMy daughter and I were talking about future tech and what not recently.

I strongly recomend this game to anyone that likes castlevania, metroid, deus ex, or just good sci fi in general.\nTo the developers: this would make a great addition to xbox one and ps4.","July 4, 2015","true","29.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A smaller version of Deus Ex in 2D.\nLong version? A good cyberpunk RPG. And as far as I know it contains everything related to cyberpunk:\n- hacking? check\n- cyborgs? check\n- combat? check\n- stealth? check\n- conspiracy? check\n- corporations? check\nAnd, it's a true RPG. You have choices, both plot related and how to approach obstacles. You can hack them, silently take them down, convince them, bribe them, punch them or shot them. Yes, I know, no everything can be solved in every way, but still, this feels and plays like Deus Ex.\nGraphics? Good 2D backgrounds. good 2D characters.\nSounds/voice - good sound design. Music is nice, feets the game. All NPCs are voiced, you character is not (Fallout 1-New Vegas style).\nControls - simple, but you will to get used to combat. Can be difficult at the begging of the game when you are fighting multiple enemies. But hey, you don't have to fight, you can dodge/sneak.\nHacking - simple visually but very nice twin stick shooter. Like a mini game.\nOverall, I can't find anything bad with this game. For me, this felt like a good Deus Ex style game, with branching paths, side quest.","April 3","true","13.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Here only because of VERY early access which is able to frighten off potential buyers, I wouldn't advise to pay to it attention at least a month more! I will explain why …\n\nFirst, to understand a plot, all its artful designs and it is simple not to blunder at a choice of some answer, for example, from you it is required language skills, thus at quite high level! There is a lot of text dialogues that on the one hand can't but please, always there is an option, let and imaginary (for us already all solved), they interesting also tighten, but with another … without even English postscoring it is boring! Really, boringly … Secondly, management! Because in Dex of tinctures is also not present, in general, will be to adjust it under itself to owners of ordinary keyboards incredibly difficult, especially to shoot. Clear business that before us nearly the first working alpha, hotfiksa and which updatings leave with velocity of light, but in a type of misinformation from outside whether the bought critics, whether someone else — people take it in hope to see SOMETHING, and receive … ahem, %5 of the read! For this reason I don't write reviews on games that are at a testing stage, it and is ridiculous and sad …\n\nThe fighting system quite good, everyone will be able to find itself whether it be in the fighter of near fight, whether it be distant and if go to the technician's branch which to us is promised to enter that in general is excellent! Now even pumping as that isn't present, there are standard brace bits, but this business such — not clearly works it or not, for acquaintance it supposedly with what everything began and where came, but for passing … not its! Potential is, quests, non-standard and though hinting at the Sensuality, but … jumping off at the most inappropriate moment especially were pleasant. Wash to you council, for a start run all over the city, look that to what, collect all tasks, visit the dealer's bench but only after that go beyond his line, without speaking already for skirmishes with enemies! I as terribly curious person, made differently and time two was lost because on me some bandits flew from all directions, forcing down from feet and simply causing a fabulous loss, and after all coming back to management — it still that madness …\n\nGenerally, game has a future but as truly noticed Dreadlocks — wait for the termination of September but only after that pronounce it a sentence! No training, meanwhile, will exist, we press Esc or F1 and we are brought up to date. Without the same Nostromo, for example, it is necessary to you oh as it is heavy, considering that gamepads also don't work … Already kind month and I can tell game one — advance is felt forward.\n\nThe visual component in Dex is excellent, a portrayal on 5ku, optimization tightened, a soundtrack unless, still merges with a background because of what it isn't perceived properly. To be trained in all subtleties and to understand that want from us it is possible in the first hour of game! Though stop, to one seems to me, what main "heroine" resembles the man who replaced a floor more? For everything that time that I carried out in it at me NEVER there were feelings that I play for the girl, it is rather for some trance …\n\nIf you love something unusual, with soul and created with love, but in a look there isn't enough budget and to that being in a stage of early access — buy all! Support developers dollar, eventually, you thereby will accelerate its end!<3 I hope you enjoy a preview, thanks.","September 16, 2014","true","1.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The writing is good and really fits the cyberpunk mood of the game.\n\nThe quests often have multiple solutions and it depends entirely on your character skills how to best go about solving them.\n\nThe gameplay certainly isn't perfect (bugs, weak combat, weird inventory control). The lack of a quick travel option is a big time waster. The developer could have added an in game taxi service or some form of public transport.

Enough to make me not deal with it and move on until they patch some of the most basic gameplay.\n\n-Combat-\n\nMelee combat is not fluid and I found that many of my attacks fell short of connecting, even after hitting on the first punch. I'd have to stop my combo to inch forward and hope that my next punch would be within the pitifully small attack range. I defaulted to just jump kicking everyone and rolling away, rather than playing with the block and combo system they have in place.\n\nRanged combat is not intuitive as you have to press (not hold down) the left trigger button to hold your firearm and then aim with a reticule that is made for a mouse, but not translated for a gamepad. Then, you have to press your right shoulder button, and not your right trigger button, in order to fire your weapon (The design choice to keep all the buttons non-contextual hampers the entire game)  You cannot move while having your firearm drawn. I also felt figuring out how to place firearms in your quick item menu in order to even use it was... unnecessary.\n\n-Voice acting-\n\nThe voice acting ranges from serviceable to strained and then falls into annoying. The voices are not what I'm imagining the text to read as in my imagination in the slightest in many cases and the game would have done better saving everyone the trouble of having to turn them off after a few hours of what sounds to be non-English native speaking their lines. I may be wrong about the voice actor's native tongue as many of them seemed to have Western names in the credits (do voice actors need stage names?). There seems to be a great deal of variance between what is spoken and what is written in the text as well. Not enough to change their meaning, but enough to jar me as I read and listened along.\n\n-Level Design-\n\nI found myself wandering around and killing mofos before I actually needed to enter those areas. Because I could and I wanted to and they happened to be there. This more or less deconstructed the pace of the game for me. I'm sure some may counter argue that I wasn't playing with immersion in mind, but ♥♥♥♥ that. This is a cyberpunk game and that means breaking the rules and doing what you want and ♥♥♥♥ the system! Besides, I used the walk button... which is the block button... and doesn't really offer any context to when it's a walk or when it's block (so maybe I was wrong about the lack of contextual buttons... Well none of them seemed to work which brings me to...)\n\n-This is an unfinished game-\n\nThe bugs are more than a few janky controls or odd holes in the level, they break the game.\n\nI can't switch between quick items that are in my quick item menu.\n\nI can't save my game, unless I transitioned between areas. I'm taking a break from Dark Souls to play this as a casual game while I clean the ♥♥♥♥ out of my pants. I don't need to redo the same bullet hell minigame hacking simulation and jump kick my enemies to death because I walked into a room with poison gas and was already low on health.\n\nThe enemy AI is nonexistent. They can't jump. They can't climb ladders. The enemies with ranged weapons can only shoot you. They seem to be forced to keep moving away from me whilst I jump kick them to death. Low sweep was unlocked for me at times, which is supposed to be a melee move you unlock through leveling up. The worst for me was how they'd simply forget you killing the dude that was right next to them if you moved a little ways out of their line of sight... "Huh? Just a box..."\n\n(Why the ♥♥♥♥ am I looting porno mags and t-shirts from my dead enemies? I know of only one group of people that would pay money for used porno mags and t-shirts from dead people... 12 year old boys.)\n\nTo end this, I can tell the designers have a lot of love for the genre (no, kids. Deus Ex isn't what it's based on...), but this is not a full release game as stated int he product description. Other reviewers suggest a few more updates before jumping into this game. That's good advice.\n\n","May 14, 2015","false","6.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

For all of the good things about the game, I find things that are equally frustrating or unpolished. I understand a lot of people enjoy the game and that's great, I'm glad they do, but I guess as a developer myself, I'm a little more critical.\n\nStory - So, the premise of the story is ok. Assuredly not bad but nothing I haven't seen before. The character archtypes are standard cut-and-paste, and I can't say I really felt invested in any of them. It became very clear early on that Dex is supposed to be a Jesus type character, the 'Seed of Whatsis' which is an Omniscient superbeing.\n\nBut my main issue with the story is the fact that it's not until about halfway in that you even get a notion of what the game's about. I had to force myself through to get to the point where (Character) starts going on about Dex being a 'Plot Element Here.' The sidequests honestly interested me a bit more, and I have to give the devs kudos on how they managed to tie so many stories together. For instance you have characters like Mr. (Guy) who shows up in three separate side-quests and slowly you get this picture of what this character was like before -beep-.\n\nI do have to say, however, that for an 'Action Platformer' there is a lot of reading. Personally I don't mind reading, but I'd imagine a lot of players skip over the many messages, memos, and emails and miss a lot of those portions of the story. Some of these could have easily been audio-clips.\n\nFor those of you who do choose to buy this, please let me tell you now. DO NOT choose the 'Singularity' ending. No, it's not because it's 'bad,' I literally say this because if you choose Singularity, there IS no ending. If you feel you have to, just watch the Singularity ending on Youtube, the clip is about 5 seconds.\n\nMechanics - This is the area I had the most issue with. There were so many elements of the mechanics that felt unpolished or wonky. The AR, world hacking, was so frustrating that I prettymuch never used it. The guns were almost equally frustrating, to the point that I used them to shoot turrets if I had to, and then went on to punch enemies in the face. But see, there's a problem there too, because if you're overlapping the enemy at all you can't hit them. Dex has no ability to follow the mouse, so having to physically turn Dex around can break combos and means that the other 5 enemies right there have the perfect shot to beat you down. Overall the combat system felt really finicky.\n\nBut that wasn't even the worst of the mechanics issues because what aggravated me the absolute most was the fact that you don't get to choose when to save. This wouldn't be an issue, you see, if the game chose to save after important events or conversations. But the game only saves when you zone into an area, so if you spend a lot of time in that area, say, hacking GSV-2's 4 computers only to get killed, you get to do it ALL over again. This would be fine if it were a once-in-a-while thing, but I found myself turning the game off more than once because I just couldn't be bothered to redo a whole area because I'm not allowed to save.\n\nArt & Animation - So, I have no complaints about the art. It was pretty good, I have to say. The cutscenes were pretty decent as well. The animations were mostly good, but I did spot some issues here and there. The biggest issue with the animations I saw was when you were having a conversation with someone. There was little effort put into lip-sync and half the time the characters would just freeze halfway through their lip-sync while the audio kept going.\n\nSound & Music - The music was pretty good. Very nice soundtrack, not too distracting and added to the setting of the scenes quite nicely. Sounds became an issue when Dex's little squeaking-moan every time she jumps got on my nerves. I also noticed a major issue in the Docks where the sound of the water lapping was always loud and persisted even when I had ALL game sounds muted from within the game (I had to go into my computer's sound mixer to physically mute the game itself).\n\nThe 'Hacking' Minigame - An interesting take on hacking I have to say... But like some of the elements of the game it felt a bit unpolished. It wasn't bad, but it just didn't quite feel right at the same time.","May 20, 2015","false","14.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

So I basically want to make this a short review where I do not focus overly much on those things - there are plenty of bugs, most, if not all, of the game breaking ones are gone by now.\n\nI bought the game when it left early access. It didn't take long to finish the game - I have 16 hours on record as I write this. At least 2 hours were spent trying to figure out why 2 quests wouldn't update. Turned out to be because of some bugs.\n\nThe really great thing about this game is the atmosphere. The world is alive and buzzing with flavor. The voice acting really brings the game to a whole new level.\nUnfortunately that's the best thing about the game - as of yet. (at least for me)\n\nThe combat is not fun. It feels more like a chore to get to the next point of interest.\nIt's basically just button mashing. You can go in for the stealth kill, but most of the time it will just break the immersion as you'll, more often that not, see a clunky animation when doing so. You can buy (or find) guns, but personally I didn't care for them.\n\nHacking is a mini-game of it own. I wouldn't say it's fun, but it's there. It's like a 'free roam' Alien Invaders game.\n\nI was expecting a lot from the implant system. But sadly it left me feeling hollow. By the time I unlocked the implant system (it's a quest), I had already completed a few side quests. Having some money I was basically able to buy every implant (save for 1 implant - you have a set number of implant slots) right away. It was very unsatisfying.\n\nThere are a few interesting quests, and they're well written.\nThat being said I didn't really like the quest system. Being a 'explore all' freak, I found that I was collecting things for quests I hadn't even started yet. There were times where I had completed every task of the quest right after receiving it. So all I had to do was talk to the quest giver 1 second later to finish the quest.\nI'm a fan of free roaming, but maybe the quest items could spawn after being given the quest. As apposed to being there before I even know about the quest.\n\nI like parts of the game, but I wouldn't go as far as to say I recommend it. And I find the price (even with 10% off) to be too high. If there was a "50/50" button I would hit it. I know some people will feel cheated buying this game.\n\nThe game has potential - the game-world is there, and it's brimming with cyber punk quality. But the game is lacking in most other regards. It feels rushed with all the bugs. Hopefully they'll continue to develop patches, tweaks, and maybe even a few more quests.\n\nTo conclude:\n\nI can't recommend this game, but I don't want to disencourage people either.\nIf you like cyber punk games, and want to spend a few hours in a beautiful world, this might be a game for you. It has it's let downs, but it also has a lot of soul.\n\nI would rate it 5 out of 10.","May 16, 2015","false","16.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Multiple times.\n\nEnemies hit hard, and health packs are expensive.  Worse, you have TWO health bars to worry about (HP and focus, which is basically HP while hacking).  At the beginning there are a number of quests that require skills you won't have... but you can't get because you can't complete the quests.  Maxing out hacking and lockpicking are NOT optional.\n\nThe game really, really needs a proper quicksave button.  The standard F5 throws you into the save menu, which is better than nothing, but when you leave you're in the "Game paused" menu.  I'd rather something you can just mash and keep playing, because you'll be bruteforcing a lot of stuff.\n\nHacking is far too hard at the beginning (thus why you need to max your hacking skill ASAP).\n\nGamepad input is terrible, but that's apparently a limitation of the Unity engine.  I tried to use my Steam Controller... it was awful.  The gamepad config utility is also awful... it's not able to determine the direction of the right "stick" on the SC.  It'll also hang if you try to quit.  Don't even bother... just stick with the mouse and keyboard.\n\nThere's a fantastic story in this game.  I really want to experience it.

My first ended after a couple of hours in sheer frustration and I didn't pick it back up again until some months later. To me, this is a very alluring game as I love the cyberpunk theme and I can't think of a game that's set the atmosphere better than this one. As an interactive story, it works. As a game? Not so much.\n\nBefore I present my negatives I would like to be clear that I've really enjoyed Dex. It'll go down as one of my favorites of all time but I can't in good conscience recommend this to anyone but the most hardcore of cyberpunk fans.\n\nHere are the biggest challenges you'll face while playing:\n\n1. Hand holding - This game doesn't do it, at all, so don't expect a helpful lesson in anything. Ever. Explanation of basic mechanics would have been nice. I avoided hacking until the last couple of hours of playtime. I was never sure if what I was doing was correct or if I was just wasting my time.\n\n2. Hacking - Sucks until you're uber powerful.\n\n3. Combat - Nothing wrong with a bit of difficulty but the AI will consistently block your punches, kicks and no amount of button pressing or combos will break their block mechanic. Your best bet is to exit the area and return. Repeat that step until you "roll" an enemy that isn't perpetually in block mode.\n\n4. Stealth - Yeah, whatever. Good luck being stealthy. There's no skill slots or upgrades for this, so it is what it is and that isn't much. It should be striped from the game as it doesn't serve a purpose.\n\n5. Bugs - Almost a year out and the game still has some mind boggling big bugs. I have not encountered any game breaking bugs but I've run into one that just completely ruins what little immersion a 2D platformer can have. The best way to describe it without giving too much detail is that you're playing as someone else on screen... you hear their voice, see their headshot in the dialog box but you're still running around as Dex.\n\nI don't expect to see much change in the game at this point. I do hope they go on to make another as I would be the "first in line" to get it if it were in the same universe.","January 3","false","21.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Combat in particular is a complete mess; if there's only one enemy, you can just crouch and punch them in the shins with no danger to yourself, and if there's more than one enemy you're mostly screwed. Definitely has potential, but I can't recommend it until the gameplay undergoes some vast development.","January 30, 2015","false","0.3"," 21 of 44 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","21","44","0","0"

However, my praise pretty much extends solely to it's art style and music choice. If I were basing this game on looks alone it'd pretty much keep it because it really is one of the prettier looking games out there on steam.\n\nSince Dex is an action-based cyberpunk platforming/cypberspace 2D shoot'em'up stealth game, It has a lot of parts it has to think of ingenious ways of including. Let's just say for now that they succeeded in some, and failed in others.\n\nFirst let's talk about the actual platforming aspect of the game, which isn't too bad. Some of the animations are a little iffy though (I'm looking at you, crouch-walking. Seriously, who does that?) as well as some of the controls being a little far-fetched for both PC and Controller users in general. Every once and awhile some of the controls are a bit unresponsive (In the tutorial, I found that I was unable to punch back, despite clicking until I advanced to a certain point in the stage) so on, so forth.\n\nNext, let's talk about combat which is a central part of this game. As you progress, I'd imagine that your character get's more things, but for now let's just talk about what I unlocked in the first hour. A simple three-hit combo, the ability to dodge, and a jump-kick move that let's you get the drop on some enemies. Combat's pretty solid if we're talking meelee.\n\nNow ranged combat is a disaster, and let me tell you why. For some unexplicable reason your character stands still to shoot guns. This is literally their worst decision in the production of this game. In a game where characters with guns are shooting at you and it could cost you potentially half your health in one round, it's a bad game decision at all to make your character stand still. The animations seems a little clunky, and so is the aiming interface in general.\n\nStealth was seldom used for the parts I played, so someone else might elaborate on that further.\n\nVoice-acting was top notch though. Tony was my favorite character in the hour I played. Seriously, if only every game put that much effort into making -every- interactable NPC in the world have an actual voice, it just draws you into the game. Characters are easily recognizable/memorable in even just the hour I played the game.\n\nOverall though, I can't really recommend it. The combat just felt too clunky, and it felt like the game didn't do that great of a job within a two-hour span of really getting that last tug on me that said "Keep Me." so to speak. For all of it's strengths, in far too many area's did it fall short.","July 16, 2015","false","1.4"," 15 of 32 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","15","32","0","8"

The game is fairly decent in most respects except for two very key features. The game uses checkpoint saves, which is fine in some cases, when there are actually checkpoints. The game saves at the start of every area you enter and ONLY at the start. Meaning if you die at any point in a map, you HAVE to start again. Once is fine, but if you die multiple times because you simply missed a jump and landed in the wrong place or an enemy sees you the moment you walk through a door and blasts half your health away with a gun at range... it becomes very tedious very very fast.\n\nDeath and saves brings me to the second reason not to play this game. This reason is only a factor because of the save system, however, yo take fall damage, and quite a decent amount. This is fine. What is not fine, is the fact that the game marks no difference between platforms you can land on and ones you simply pass through. Meaning death. Restart.\n\n\nOn a positive note. The art is nice, the voice acting is quite decent, the control mechanics are not perfectly fluid, but are still enjoyable, and the rpg side of things seems fairly well balanced with some small room for replay. The plot is interesting enough to pull you through, and the side quests are quite well done, with multiple different quests intersecting each other, which i found to be a nice touch!\n\n75% off this game is fun, but i just cannot recommend anyway buy it until the save system is changed.

That feel that lets the player know that if a little more work was done, then this game would be something great.\n\nMelee combat is a bit of a mess because enemies don't stagger so most of a fight is spent chasing after them. Melee upgrades are mostly combo extenders, but those don't help you because you'll busy chasing after someone who just shrugged off being punched in the head. The dodge roll dodges all melee attacks that I found, and you start the game with it. Cybernetic upgrades are also a bit underwhelming when I saw giant dudes full robot arms punching way harder than I was.\n\nQuests feel buggy and unfinished. There have been points in the game where I found information on a person while just innocently rooting through their apartment, as cyberpunks are known to do. This is information that I did not need yet, and when I talked to a reporter, they told me the trail had gone cold. I went back to check the info again, and talked to the reporter again, and I still couldn't continue with the quest. When this happened it made me afraid to go off the beaten path, that by finding things out of order I could lose more content.\n\nA boss I found was easily the most frustrating experience of the game. Having set myself up for punchy fights, I was told to go punch up some military dudes and their crazy military commander. I ran in to punch them and took a shotgun blast to the teeth. This was no big deal, I wanted to be punchy and the game shouldn't change to fit that. What was a problem was the boss, or rather, the goons that the boss summoned. This goons come from nowhere. I made sure to kill all goons on the way to the bossman, and before fighting him there is a large drop. These goons just walk in from the edge of the screen and start blasting. I couldn't punch out the goons without being shot to death, and if I punched out the boss then the goons would keep shooting while I stood still to talk to him.\n\nA minor grip I had was that no matter where I had the camera, Dex always looked blocky. Fully zoomed in I could count the pixels on Dex's face, fully zoomed out I could count the pixels on Dex's head, even on the default setting for the camera, I could still count the pixels on Dex's face.\n\nAll of this put together means I cannot recommend it, which saddens me. The cyberpunk sounded really nice, the story sounded really nice, the characters sounded really cool, but the execution was lacking.","July 14, 2015","false","9.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

But it certainly wasn't 'fun' enough to warrant it really only having two hours of gameplay, minus the few I have from leaving the game open.\n\nAbsolutely riddled with bugs, a lot of gameplay mechanics simply poorly designed, the story and characters really not all too interesting. Plot was meh, attempt at a plot twist was meh, final boss was meh. Gameplay is mostly just you clicking rapidly and hoping that the dude falls over before you do.\n\nAll in all, meh.

Do you like gaining lots of power ups and then being denied their use right at the end of the game? Do you like annoying NPCs with terrible voice acting? If you answered "yesh" to any or all of these questions, then this game is for you.\n\nPros: fun powerups, interesting storyline (when it doesn't drone on), and a great futuristic dystopian atmosphere.\n\nCons: you can't level up each skill all the way, you don't have any notion of which skills will be useful until the end, and the game play actually gets progressively worse! Nerfing my character at the end is the biggest "NO-NO" of all time. The most frustrating and annoying ending ever. *spoiler alert* trying to do anything other than running through is a waste of time, then doing anything other than taking cheap long distance shots is a waste of time.\n\nThe platformer action RPG part of the game is far and away the best. It's VERY fun and just challenging enough. The 2d scrolling shooter aspect of the game is TERRIBLE and so god danm boring! Yet it remains one of the most critical areas tht you should power up.\n\n*more spoilers*\n\nDon't bother powering up your endurance/melee the whole way, you wont get the chance to use that many implants. Don't bother doing anything with the charisma/conversation option aspect, it's just boring dialog. AR hacking? pointless. Get lockpicking (essential) and hacking skills (yes I know I said I hate that part, that's why you ♥♥♥♥ing need it!) Shooting skills? Pointless, bullets do little damage and take forever to reload. The shotgun has a magazine of 2 and can't one shot anything??\n\nGOD there are so many things wrong with this game it is so frustrating!! I am still confused why I found it fun when it just seems like from a game design standpoint, there are so many things wrong. Finally at the very end you see two little data nodes to hack, pick the left one and it's game over (as in win). What's at the top one? I don't know. I couldn't pick it because the game was OVER!\n\nOVERALL: A fun game that makes you hate yourself for enjoying and wasting time playing it.\n\nSomeone shoot me.

Enemies do not respawn, and their drops are random, so the overall pool you have to earn extra creds, items, and XP is limited. You will not be able to completely max out your stats, and there are distinct advantages to each specific upgrade path... choosing wisely is essential. Almost all of the side quests and main quests have alternate solutions that will give varying rewards... again, choice is important... not coincidentally, choice and free-will is quite plot-important.\n\nThe save-state of the game has been one of the things frequently patched... currently, there is not option to save via the player's choice and instead there is an auto save that occurs every time the character moves into a new loaded area. The last 10 auto-saves are queue'd up in memory for loading, and the specific chapters of the main plot have their own load points... and this works effectively well. To be honest, the previous method of being able to save at any point in an area to keep your collected pick-ups and then load that area over again if the enemy drops weren't what you wanted was an easy way of cheating... you can still do that now by running back and forth between loading areas every time you defeat a foe or group of foes and pick up their drops, but it's much more time consuming and not very functional.\n\nThe game drops you into the thick of things right from the get-go. You can die in the tutorial area. You can die in a few specific places where you think a jump will land only to discover the building ledge is background scenery and not an actual surface. You can die from your first real encounters. You will die a few times and it will feel frustrating, but it is VERY important to know that any area you find (aside from the tutorial), you can get back to later in the game after you've upgraded your abilities a bit... the game does not do a good job of letting you feel that areas are explorable more than once in the beginning portions of  the plot, resulting in a lot of pointless player-deaths that didn't have to happen... which, along with the glitches and bugs that have been found in some of the side-quests, has been frustrating to new players... the glitches are being patched as the game goes on, and the patches have not been save-state breaking, for the most part. I think it's safe to say that unless they add anything massively new to the game, at this point any future patches will not ruin any progress you've made.\n\nThe feel of this game is excellent... fully reasonable cyberpunk places, settings, dystopias, corps, gangs, hackers, junkies, and street folks outside and inside of the systems... notes, files, and conversations all fit the mood of the setting, and it's been a fun world to tromp through.","May 17, 2015","true","29.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like Deus Ex, Dex is a cyberpunk themed RPG set in a dystopic near-future city where the player character finds themselves caught up in a battle between oppressive authoritarian forces and an underground resistance movement. There are installable body mods, multiple-path multi-solution encounter design structures, questions about ‘what it means to be human?’, trenchcoats, and shiny neon Chinatown locales. The list of similarities is long then but Dex does differ in so far as it is a 2-D sidescroller as opposed to Deus Ex's 3-D closed world levels, and it’d be fair to say that there is a greater emphasis on melee combat in this new title.\n\nIt also leans pretty heavily on the sentient AI themes of Deus Ex; a trope that has been seen multiple times before in books and film, (Ghost in the Shell, Neuromancer etc.). This isn’t a bad thing if you like these sorts of stories (as I do) but unfortunately there’s little that’s novel about the narrative arc of Dex.\n\nBut I don’t want to sound too down on Dex though, because in spite of the lack of novelty, the occasional jank that I encountered with the game, and the fact that none of the game’s systems are better than comparable systems in any other game, the way everything comes together is mostly enjoyable. Even if much of the story is telegraphed, even if some of the character VO is straight up bad, even if the inventory system is cumbersome, even if some of the body mods, guns, and upgrades are kind of pointless… I still found myself getting hooked enough by this game to want to see it through to the end (time to beat was ~15 hours).\n\nAt the end of the day while I liked Dex quite a bit, I wouldn't go so far as to say I'd universally recommend it. However, if you’re like me and you’re a sucker for cyberpunk themed games then this is could be fun experience that will likely frustrate you at times, but if you can appreciate it for what it is then you’ll probably have a good time with it.","May 17, 2015","true","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The basics: Your character can stealth and fight in the real world in this 2d platformer with rpg elements, or she can jump into cyberspace and fight in a top-down geometry-war-esque point and shoot.\n\nThe story drops you right in without explanation, which makes sense for the story, but that continues for the rest of the game. See my cons.\n\nThe Good: Interesting story, characters, most everything except your character is voice acted, and there are different ways to go about your goals. Fighting has enough diversity and movesets that I looked forward to nearly every enemy I faced. A solid and enjoyable 2D Platformer with many modern perspectives on issues.\n\nThe Bad: Well, that lack of explanation goes throughout the game. There are tons of items, most of which have no use, are just money in another form. There were apparently extra abilities I could use in Cyberspace, but I could not find a helpfile nor in-game explanation of how to switch to them. (For other players, I'm talking about the non-consumable abilities, like spammer and arc. I did see the keys for shockwave and datashield.) And the finale demanded I play in a particular way. This lack of choice was frustrating - I had avoided guns in the game, getting by on melee and stealth - now I HAD to use guns. So instead of loving the finale, I spent my time dying, swearing, and replaying.\n\nOverall: An enjoyable game that is worth the money. The studio is poised to do great things; I am glad I supported them.\n\nFeedback for Devs:\nGun drawing breaks the fluidity of combat. Take a look at that.\nConsider more guidance on what items need to be kept, and what have no use.\nProvide an attack for after you've knocked the legs out from under someone. They are on the ground, they should be vulnerable. Instead the only melee attack I could do was to keep knocking them down for 1 to 2 damage.\nTake a look at those extra cyberspace ability disks. Yeah the wedges is useful, but it got stale by the end. I wish I could have used the spammer and arc. Maybe it's simply a misunderstanding on my part, but I did look for ways to use them.\nChoosing lockpicking as the first ability is a bit OP. I bypassed so many areas, and got really disconnected from the main story.","May 28, 2015","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Strong overall theme.\n\nIt has a strong story but allows significant freedom to roam around avoiding the main plot as well.  It does have a limited amount of enemies though; no respawning, so eventually you'll run out of non-main plot things to do if you're putting it off.    The economy / character skill progression feels balanced, with the beginning being hardest and the game getting a bit easier overall as your character gets more skills and equipment.   Even skills like barter and lockpicking are useful though, with the lack of respawning enemies or loot.  This said, I've ended the game twice with a few thousand money unspent each time.\n\nPacing / length to complete also feels like it's in the right place, but I've been a completionist with it.  Rushing through would make the game MUCH harder and shorter.  The world itself is not all that large, but none of the areas feel like filler.  It took me roughly 15 hours to complete the first time, and 9 hours the second time around (knowing exactly where to go and how the combat system works speeds things up a lot).\n\nCombat is good overall.  Some quirks make things difficult at times, though.  Guns feel awkward to use. When you use one, your screen jerks quickly in the direction you're facing and you get a targeting cursor to shoot with.  Moving at all breaks this.  Moving the cursor to aim behind you rapidly jerks the screen the other way.  God help you if you have to aim at something near your character or directly above.\nMelee combat feels fluid and well thought out.  Enemies attack with set attacks that each have ways to dodge or block them while still getting some hits of your own in.    Hacking / AR combat (with the skill point spent to use it on human targets) starts slow and a little awkward, but after upgrades makes you able to easily take down opponents with little risk.\n\nThe story, the music and the art.  These three things combine to make an excellent experience. Most areas have music unique to them to help set the mood for that area, and it works well.  The crowded city areas also have background city noise that gives it a crowded city feel without overpowering the music or sound effects. The art for each area is distinct as well, and you won't see the same set pieces reused over and over.\n\nIssues:  There were two areas that were incredibly frustrating and required many re-loads the first time around.  They were both optional side quests.  One featured a devilish jumping puzzle, and the other a timed escape with most exits suddenly blocked. Losing on the second one meant losing all progress in that area, which meant if you spent half an hour killing all the enemies there, and then failed to get out in time, that was all gone.\nThere was a point where the main plot would not advance quite properly.  You had to find information in a computer for the story, but for it to actually move on, you had to also make sure to find all the useless information in addition to the good stuff.\nRanged combat is the only other issued I've had with the game, and I already went into detail on that.\n\nOverall, I found it to be a very enjoyable game and well worth the $20 asking price.","May 29, 2015","true","27.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This isn’t a bad thing if you like these sorts of stories (as I do) but unfortunately there’s little that’s novel about the narrative arc of Dex.\n\nBut I don’t want to sound too down on Dex though, because in spite of the lack of novelty, the occasional jank that I encountered with the game, and the fact that none of the game’s systems are better than comparable systems in any other game, the way everything comes together is mostly enjoyable. Even if much of the story is telegraphed, even if some of the character VO is straight up bad, even if the inventory system is cumbersome, even if some of the body mods, guns, and upgrades are kind of pointless… I still found myself getting hooked enough by this game to want to see it through to the end (time to beat was ~15 hours).\n\nAt the end of the day while I liked Dex quite a bit, I wouldn't go so far as to say I'd universally recommend it. However, if you’re like me and you’re a sucker for cyberpunk themed games then this is could be fun experience that will likely frustrate you at times, but if you can appreciate it for what it is then you’ll probably have a good time with it.","May 17, 2015","true","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Enemies do not respawn, and their drops are random, so the overall pool you have to earn extra creds, items, and XP is limited. You will not be able to completely max out your stats, and there are distinct advantages to each specific upgrade path... choosing wisely is essential. Almost all of the side quests and main quests have alternate solutions that will give varying rewards... again, choice is important... not coincidentally, choice and free-will is quite plot-important.\n\nThe save-state of the game has been one of the things frequently patched... currently, there is not option to save via the player's choice and instead there is an auto save that occurs every time the character moves into a new loaded area. The last 10 auto-saves are queue'd up in memory for loading, and the specific chapters of the main plot have their own load points... and this works effectively well. To be honest, the previous method of being able to save at any point in an area to keep your collected pick-ups and then load that area over again if the enemy drops weren't what you wanted was an easy way of cheating... you can still do that now by running back and forth between loading areas every time you defeat a foe or group of foes and pick up their drops, but it's much more time consuming and not very functional.\n\nThe game drops you into the thick of things right from the get-go. You can die in the tutorial area. You can die in a few specific places where you think a jump will land only to discover the building ledge is background scenery and not an actual surface. You can die from your first real encounters. You will die a few times and it will feel frustrating, but it is VERY important to know that any area you find (aside from the tutorial), you can get back to later in the game after you've upgraded your abilities a bit... the game does not do a good job of letting you feel that areas are explorable more than once in the beginning portions of  the plot, resulting in a lot of pointless player-deaths that didn't have to happen... which, along with the glitches and bugs that have been found in some of the side-quests, has been frustrating to new players... the glitches are being patched as the game goes on, and the patches have not been save-state breaking, for the most part. I think it's safe to say that unless they add anything massively new to the game, at this point any future patches will not ruin any progress you've made.\n\nThe feel of this game is excellent... fully reasonable cyberpunk places, settings, dystopias, corps, gangs, hackers, junkies, and street folks outside and inside of the systems... notes, files, and conversations all fit the mood of the setting, and it's been a fun world to tromp through.","May 17, 2015","true","29.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Woken from sleep one night by an mysterious figure called Raycast and told to run for it, Dex is thrust into an underworld of hackers and criminals as she seeks to figure out why one of the mysterious corporations who run the world want her dead.\n\nThe game is a side scroller with action combat that includes both melee and gunplay. You earn experience to level your character up by completing quests and winning battles, putting points into various skills like hacking, lockpicking and combat to improve Dex's abilities as the game goes on. You can also purchase cybernetic upgrades to further boost your abilities. The game also includes a cyberspace hacking mode which plays out a lot like a bullet hell shooter only not as frantic.\n\nThe plot is quite good and there a lot of quests to complete, often with multiple ways to finish them. It is engaging and there are a few plot twists to be had along the way. The writing is solid though I personally found the ending a little abrupt.\n\nOverall Dex is a fun game and if you like cyberpunk settings or action RPG's you should enjoy yourself. I found the combat a little weak but by the end of the game you are can wade through it so it becomes less of a drag. The game is quite polished with good graphics and some pretty solid voice acting from the main cast.

So far the game sticks to its aesthetics, and to the cyberpunk theme, and it's easy to get lost in the rich world. Getting snippets of background info in the shape of mini essays and emails through the hacking minigame shows that the game borrows from Deus Ex: Human Revolution, with the yellow/amber HUD-elements bringing the point home harder still. Deus Ex is not a bad game to borrow from by any means, and the initial clunkiness of the character, having 0 skill points invested, reminds a little of the player character in the original Deus Ex. The player can, however, upgrade themselves through leveling and cybernetic augmantation, and their chosen style of play becomes comparatively easier.\n\nDex is not an easy game on the default difficulty (the difficulty can be lowered), but it feels like that's because to do everything, you need to specialise in everything, which is per definition impossible. You can bulldoze through as a regenerating tank, sneak around under the cover of darkness, or you can hack turrets, alarms and the implants of your enemies to get an edge. If you're unprepared, you can't really bull through without cheese like sniping people offscreen by memory, but getting killed feels more like a rebuke to find another way where this is the case. Some problems come to mind, the platforms not popping enough for example, but I would recommend the game in a heartbeat.","March 27","true","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like Deus Ex, Dex is a cyberpunk themed RPG set in a dystopic near-future city where the player character finds themselves caught up in a battle between oppressive authoritarian forces and an underground resistance movement. There are installable body mods, multiple-path multi-solution encounter design structures, questions about ‘what it means to be human?’, trenchcoats, and shiny neon Chinatown locales. The list of similarities is long then but Dex does differ in so far as it is a 2-D sidescroller as opposed to Deus Ex's 3-D closed world levels, and it’d be fair to say that there is a greater emphasis on melee combat in this new title.\n\nIt also leans pretty heavily on the sentient AI themes of Deus Ex; a trope that has been seen multiple times before in books and film, (Ghost in the Shell, Neuromancer etc.). This isn’t a bad thing if you like these sorts of stories (as I do) but unfortunately there’s little that’s novel about the narrative arc of Dex.\n\nBut I don’t want to sound too down on Dex though, because in spite of the lack of novelty, the occasional jank that I encountered with the game, and the fact that none of the game’s systems are better than comparable systems in any other game, the way everything comes together is mostly enjoyable. Even if much of the story is telegraphed, even if some of the character VO is straight up bad, even if the inventory system is cumbersome, even if some of the body mods, guns, and upgrades are kind of pointless… I still found myself getting hooked enough by this game to want to see it through to the end (time to beat was ~15 hours).\n\nAt the end of the day while I liked Dex quite a bit, I wouldn't go so far as to say I'd universally recommend it. However, if you’re like me and you’re a sucker for cyberpunk themed games then this is could be fun experience that will likely frustrate you at times, but if you can appreciate it for what it is then you’ll probably have a good time with it.","May 17, 2015","true","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this game to any fans of the sci-fi/cyberpunk genre.

The basics: Your character can stealth and fight in the real world in this 2d platformer with rpg elements, or she can jump into cyberspace and fight in a top-down geometry-war-esque point and shoot.\n\nThe story drops you right in without explanation, which makes sense for the story, but that continues for the rest of the game. See my cons.\n\nThe Good: Interesting story, characters, most everything except your character is voice acted, and there are different ways to go about your goals. Fighting has enough diversity and movesets that I looked forward to nearly every enemy I faced. A solid and enjoyable 2D Platformer with many modern perspectives on issues.\n\nThe Bad: Well, that lack of explanation goes throughout the game. There are tons of items, most of which have no use, are just money in another form. There were apparently extra abilities I could use in Cyberspace, but I could not find a helpfile nor in-game explanation of how to switch to them. (For other players, I'm talking about the non-consumable abilities, like spammer and arc. I did see the keys for shockwave and datashield.) And the finale demanded I play in a particular way. This lack of choice was frustrating - I had avoided guns in the game, getting by on melee and stealth - now I HAD to use guns. So instead of loving the finale, I spent my time dying, swearing, and replaying.\n\nOverall: An enjoyable game that is worth the money. The studio is poised to do great things; I am glad I supported them.\n\nFeedback for Devs:\nGun drawing breaks the fluidity of combat. Take a look at that.\nConsider more guidance on what items need to be kept, and what have no use.\nProvide an attack for after you've knocked the legs out from under someone. They are on the ground, they should be vulnerable. Instead the only melee attack I could do was to keep knocking them down for 1 to 2 damage.\nTake a look at those extra cyberspace ability disks. Yeah the wedges is useful, but it got stale by the end. I wish I could have used the spammer and arc. Maybe it's simply a misunderstanding on my part, but I did look for ways to use them.\nChoosing lockpicking as the first ability is a bit OP. I bypassed so many areas, and got really disconnected from the main story.","May 28, 2015","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Strong overall theme.\n\nIt has a strong story but allows significant freedom to roam around avoiding the main plot as well.  It does have a limited amount of enemies though; no respawning, so eventually you'll run out of non-main plot things to do if you're putting it off.    The economy / character skill progression feels balanced, with the beginning being hardest and the game getting a bit easier overall as your character gets more skills and equipment.   Even skills like barter and lockpicking are useful though, with the lack of respawning enemies or loot.  This said, I've ended the game twice with a few thousand money unspent each time.\n\nPacing / length to complete also feels like it's in the right place, but I've been a completionist with it.  Rushing through would make the game MUCH harder and shorter.  The world itself is not all that large, but none of the areas feel like filler.  It took me roughly 15 hours to complete the first time, and 9 hours the second time around (knowing exactly where to go and how the combat system works speeds things up a lot).\n\nCombat is good overall.  Some quirks make things difficult at times, though.  Guns feel awkward to use. When you use one, your screen jerks quickly in the direction you're facing and you get a targeting cursor to shoot with.  Moving at all breaks this.  Moving the cursor to aim behind you rapidly jerks the screen the other way.  God help you if you have to aim at something near your character or directly above.\nMelee combat feels fluid and well thought out.  Enemies attack with set attacks that each have ways to dodge or block them while still getting some hits of your own in.    Hacking / AR combat (with the skill point spent to use it on human targets) starts slow and a little awkward, but after upgrades makes you able to easily take down opponents with little risk.\n\nThe story, the music and the art.  These three things combine to make an excellent experience. Most areas have music unique to them to help set the mood for that area, and it works well.  The crowded city areas also have background city noise that gives it a crowded city feel without overpowering the music or sound effects. The art for each area is distinct as well, and you won't see the same set pieces reused over and over.\n\nIssues:  There were two areas that were incredibly frustrating and required many re-loads the first time around.  They were both optional side quests.  One featured a devilish jumping puzzle, and the other a timed escape with most exits suddenly blocked. Losing on the second one meant losing all progress in that area, which meant if you spent half an hour killing all the enemies there, and then failed to get out in time, that was all gone.\nThere was a point where the main plot would not advance quite properly.  You had to find information in a computer for the story, but for it to actually move on, you had to also make sure to find all the useless information in addition to the good stuff.\nRanged combat is the only other issued I've had with the game, and I already went into detail on that.\n\nOverall, I found it to be a very enjoyable game and well worth the $20 asking price.","May 29, 2015","true","27.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So far the game sticks to its aesthetics, and to the cyberpunk theme, and it's easy to get lost in the rich world. Getting snippets of background info in the shape of mini essays and emails through the hacking minigame shows that the game borrows from Deus Ex: Human Revolution, with the yellow/amber HUD-elements bringing the point home harder still. Deus Ex is not a bad game to borrow from by any means, and the initial clunkiness of the character, having 0 skill points invested, reminds a little of the player character in the original Deus Ex. The player can, however, upgrade themselves through leveling and cybernetic augmantation, and their chosen style of play becomes comparatively easier.\n\nDex is not an easy game on the default difficulty (the difficulty can be lowered), but it feels like that's because to do everything, you need to specialise in everything, which is per definition impossible. You can bulldoze through as a regenerating tank, sneak around under the cover of darkness, or you can hack turrets, alarms and the implants of your enemies to get an edge. If you're unprepared, you can't really bull through without cheese like sniping people offscreen by memory, but getting killed feels more like a rebuke to find another way where this is the case. Some problems come to mind, the platforms not popping enough for example, but I would recommend the game in a heartbeat.","March 27","true","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't intend this to be a full-scale review so I will simply sum up what I liked and what I disliked:\n+ responsive, fast-paced, fun to play\n+ well-written scenario and dialogues\n+ rich background environement, both in texture details as in the narrative\n+ very successfully rendered atmosphere of the 80s-90s cyberpunk novels or graphic novels, without comprimising to much in favour of tasteless fan-service\n\n- don't think you can even begin to appreciate the game if you don't pay thorough attention to the side quests\n- main character lacks in psychology (OK i get it that you want some template any player can fill in, but the rebel/teenager attitude falls a bit short sometimes)\n- Cyberspace tasks too easy even with basic hacking abilities\n\nThis game is a must for any cyberpunk fan/maniac/nostalgic\nThis game should be given a shot if you'd like an immersive universe and story that seems to have a life of it's own but don't have too much time to play.\n\n","April 20","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The overal main red line of the story is as to be expected one done many times over, it is hard to avoid and frankly the least important factor of the story. Now what made the story great for me are all the little bits, the mistakes you can make without knowing the way you see everything play out and than get that subtle hint that you could have done better. I think now I completed my first playthrough I will certainly do an other as I missed some side quests and I like to see if I can do better with some of the things I did.\n\nOveral I would recommend this game if it is up your ally gameplay wise and story wise.

It's pretty thrilling. I wouldn't say it's worth the retail price - wait for a special or something, maybe?? - but I can say that it's a valuable timesink. The game felt a lot longer than it actually was, which only speaks highly of how enthrilling this game is. If you wear headphones and play in a dark room, you -feel- like a part of DEX.\n\nThe endings, however? ♥♥♥♥. No offense to the team but after you "defeat" the main big baddie, you have a choice of three possible endings. Every single one leads to a 3-second cutscene before the ending credits pop up.\n\nThat being said, JUST BEFORE the end of the game is beautiful. In fact, the entire game is beautiful! A friend likened it to "Shadowrun without dice, then?" when I was playing. I like it. I like this game a lot. Again, not worth the $20 price tag but definitely worth getting for less","April 21","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
