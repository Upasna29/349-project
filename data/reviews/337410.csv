"http://steamcommunity.com/id/idontwannabehereanymore/recommended/337410/","idontwannabehereanymore","Alvarius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/idontwannabehereanymore/","121 products in account","I played like 30 minutes, but that is the limit of how much I could bear. First of all, Russian is my native language, so I'll be talking about game itself, rather than the fact that there's no English localization.\nSo, about character creation. There are seven classes: Witch (female), Archer (female), Swordsman (male), Paladin (female), Canoneer (male), Rogue (male), Sorceress (female). See those remarks I placed in the brackets? You got it right, all class are gender locked and there is nothing you can do about it. Next, you've got 5 choices of ugly faces (sorry, but I cannot see anyone find those faces good, or even "ok") and 5 choices or hairstyle. Ok, created the character, done.\nOnce I logged in with my character, first thing I see is some kind of "Playing diary". the idea of this diary is that in order to recieve some kind of neat rewards, you have to log in every day, to recieve other reward - log in at least once per day 7 days in a row and etc. I think that pretty much explains that this system is being used to encourage people to log in every day even for a few seconds, so devs can announce that "look, we have so many active players, playing this game every day!"\nNow next I rushed to the options, 'cause game launches at 1024\768 resolution and graphics looked horrible. Once I chose the resolution (which took some time for no apparent reason, 'cause once i hit 1600\900, screen went white for like 20 seconds) and maxed out all these graphics options. Now, first of all, even maxed out - this game looks horrible, even by f2p MMORPG standards. I find graphics of Perfect World and Lineage II C1 much more better than what I can see in Karos.  I feel like whoever made those screenshots for store page either put some time in editing, or tweaked the game somehow. Next thing is rendering and performance. Rendering is late, and game plays on less than 30 FPS, even though it looks like ♥♥♥♥ and my PC has AMD FX 8350, and GTX 770. And this on low populated area, since I saw only like 5 more guys running around with me killing the first mobs.\nI don't know about gameplay much, since I killed only like 4 mobs in total, but I wasn't impressed by animations and skill FX. Sorry, but I just couldn't bear more of this game...\nWith that said - no, forget about this game and I do hope that it will never live to see EU\US servers. If you want some decent f2p experience and you rig is somewhat weak to afford games like Archeage and similiar, play some Perfect World or Neverwinter online. or even better play NCsoft games, like Aion or Lineage II, which are currently f2p. those are much better choices. And that comes from someone, from hates these games in their current state.","January 2, 2015","false","0.6"," 1,812 of 1,940 people (93%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","93","812","1","40","33"

This is a natural reaction when the wrong audience is being invited. --\n\nThe game is only available in Russian - you won't be able to start the game without knowledge of the language or clicking around hitting random things and getting lucky. The game has a history of not being very attractive (you know how to Google, I'm sure). The game had an English version made called Rosh Online. If that game were here, it might have stood a chance against the largely English lingual audience and market that is attracted by Steam. This game, however, really should not appear with an English store page as it is very misleading. That much will be obvious from the other English reviews.\n\n----\nIf you do not speak Russian and did not see the "Not Available in your Language" message before installing this game, here are the two things that will likely go through your mind causing you distress and regret after hitting the install button.\n\n1. "I wish there was an easy way to remove games I can't understand from my library."\nand\n2. "I wish my News Feed wouldn't clutter with announcements I cannot read for a game that has a store page written in English, which I can read."\n\nWell you are in luck\n\nTo remove this game from your library:Originally posted by crimsonfate :If you click on your Steam username at the top right corner of the client and go to account details then you should see an option to remove the game from your account. Valve added the option a few months ago for free or free to play games. Thanks, CrimsonFate c:\nUPDATE 2016/01/17: You must now click "View licenses and product key activations" under Store & Purchase History to view the list where you can opt to remove the F2P games from your account.\n\nAppendage:\nThis review is heavily focused on the language barrier presented to English speakers. It also presents a solution to what will be a problem for anyone (not only English speakers) who install this game and did not realize it is not available in their own language. I thought it was written pretty clearly, but some people seem to be misreading it.\n\nThis game was a disappointment for me and I only offer advice to fellow players who might be in the position I described in my review and looking to remove this game from their library. Maybe they will come down here to read reviews and heed our warning about language barriers before ever seeing some faint, orange text and avoid this game all-together. I certainly did not see any warning text, and even if I did - why should I believe it? The store page is written is pretty respectable English, is it not?\n\nI'm trying to be empathetic in my review and, at time of this comment, my sentiment rings with more than three-quarters of the audience willing to rate my review. And majority rules - Steam is heavily English focused, so adjust your expectations accordingly. What you feel might be personally adequate is fine, but you have to remember that it is not necessarily how everyone else feels.\n\nI've re-arranged components of my review in attempts to be even clearer than I was before. The context remains identical to the original with exception for the summarizing header.","December 26, 2014","false","0.1"," 838 of 1,046 people (80%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","80","838","1","15","37"

Keep in mind that this is from someone who has never played this before steam version. First I opened the launcher and couldnt understand ♥♥♥♥ because it wasnt translated. How do you want peaple to play? So don't play this unless you know Russian. Even tho it is not translated yes, I logged into the game and tried to play it without even understanding and what I got was a nice class selection and character customization and It's not bad, you have various classes, I picked an archer. After getting into the game the first impact was that the map textures are pretty bad compared to the characters and the weird animations.

Su potencial radica en animaciones sólidas, rápidas y sincronizadas, bajos cooldowns, buffs de tiempo prolongado para esos cooldowns y skills poderosas.\n\nCuando dije sincronizadas me referí a que la latencia, las animaciones y el daño mostrado en la interfaz del juego ocurren casi al mismo tiempo casi como en el clásico Dekaron (otro juego asiático que ya es una reliquia y manifiesta un nivel de acción en un MMORPG nunca vistos hasta la fecha recordando al Diablo II, en el que puedes aumentar incluso tus estadísticas de personaje).\n\nEn cuanto al desarrollo del personaje es lógico destacar que es grinding como en todos estos juegos (desgraciadamente más los de tipo asiático) pero así mismo esto es recompensado de una forma muy ingeniosa: no con objetos preciosos y brillantes que caducan en el siguiente parche sino con Puntos Fletta. Los Puntos Fletta es un sistema que te permite dar puntos a importantes habilidades pasivas que suben de nivel al completar el conjunto de puntos que te pide y así sucesivamente (aún no sé cuál es el máximo pero empecé con una habilidad fletta que me aumentaba la rapidez de ataque empleando 10 puntos y ahora me pide 100 para subirla nuevamente de nivel para aumentar aún mas esa rapidez).Todos pensaréis que sigue siendo super grinding pero no es así, porque los Puntos Fletta no tienen límite ni penalización de nivel para obtenerlos de los monstruos: se obtienen al rellenar una barra igual que la vida y el maná, que se va cargando y una vez cargada vuelve a empezar hacia el siguiente punto.","May 6, 2015","true","0.8"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","21","3","14","2","0"
