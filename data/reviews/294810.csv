"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Red_Ocean/recommended/294810/","Red_Ocean","Red Ocean","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Red_Ocean/","347 products in account","As an introduction, I am a veteran player of Guility Gear and Blazblue series. I've won numerous tournaments in all versions of Blazblue and held the rank #1 spot for several characters on Xbox live. As i write this review I will be as neutral as possible.\n\nBlazbue is a very unique fighting game franchise, many call it the sister of Guility Gear. Blazblue is an air dasher, high speed,  combo heavy fighting game. The game is very visually satisfying and has one hell of a soundtrack. People who have a history in Street figher, SoulCaibur, DOA, Tekken, etc. Tend to somewhat stray away from Blazblue. The game sets itself apart by its core engine mechanics and unforgivable mistakes.\n\nBut fray not, the game is very newcomer friendly. Unlike many other fighting games, Blazblue Extend has an ingame voice over tutorial that guides you step by step on EVERY single game mechanic while teaching you combos at the sametime. After you go through the tutorial, you are encouraged to try "challenge mode." But don't get the challenge mode in this game twisted like the one in Street fighter or Street Fighter x Tekken.\n\n90% Challenge mode combos in this game actually teach you Basic "Bread and butter" combos that you will be using during live play. Even high level pros use some of the bread and butter combos you will see in challenge mode. They are very practical and meter efficient. Once you feel comfortable training and getting your challenge mode combos down you can take the fight online.\n\nOnline BB extend has a few differences from the console. You CANNOT turn off your ingame mic and you CANNOT see your opponents ping levels before the fight. The only way to estimate the lag is by actually engaging into the battle. With that being said, there are players from all over the world playing online. If you wish to play in player matches simply name your lobby in the general area of where you live. For example, I live in South Carolina so I name my lobby "Southeast USA", that way people can get a better estimate of the ping to be expected.\n\nBut for the sake of keeping the wall of text down, Blazblue is a great fighting game franchise for newcomers and experienced fighters. You will enjoy the incredibly unique and flashy combos by all of the characters. The game also has an interesting and yet paradoxal story which you will have fun trying to figure out on your own! Also check out the blazblue anime online if you have a hulu subscription.\nIf you have an specific questions regarding the game, you can reply to my review or send me a message on steam.\n\nEDIT: Mics can be muted or turned off ingame now.","January 20, 2015","true","83.2"," 68 of 70 people (97%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","97","68","70","7","4"

Between them, it has an top-notch (and very funny) Tutorial for all skill levels; the traditional Arcade mode; Versus (including vs CPU); Score Attack (compete for the leaderboards); Unlimited Mars (fight tougher versions of fighters at the highest difficult level); Training mode; Challenge (combo practicing); Abyss (fight waves of enemies and upgrade your character); Story (from BlazBlue Calamity Trigger and Continuum Shift) and Online (ranked, unranked and team battles).\n\nThe BlazBlue series has one of the most complex and deep stories ever. If you watched the anime (Alter Memory) and you're considering purchasing the game to discover what the fuss is about, but don't know nothing about fighting games, don't be afraid. BB:CSE has a beginner option that let you press one button to perform an special. It makes the things a lot easier for newcomers and with more practice you can abandon this option to play more seriously.\n\nBB:CSE isn't the most recent version of the series, but it's still worth it. Even with this pricetag I can't recommend enough. You'll get the bang for your buck and will experience one of the most deep and satisfying fighting games ever created.","December 11, 2014","true","40.4"," 58 of 60 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","58","60","2","0"

Myself, I've never liked the 2d fighting games, but Blazblue really helped change that if only because of its incredible story.\n\nOne thing to note though: My original intention for me buying the game was for the story, but the fun gameplay and character variety changed that.\n\nStory wise you won't find much that can compare to some of the complexity that Blazblue is. If you played the original Blazblue and didn't look up anything to understand what was happening and trial-and-error it yourself, you are a trooper. The story is so complicated at times that its hard to distinguish the "right" path from the "wrong" path. Some people take this either good or bad.\n\nFor this installment however, they changed the story portion around a bit as its not as complicated to figure out. They also added a bonus for people who did (or didn't) play the original Calamity Trigger. However, that story was reduced in depth and for those who played it, will notice a lot of dialouge change. That however wasn't a bad thing since it gave us a better grounded way to understand this game.\n\nOne of the major perks I found with this game's story: It's entirely voice-acted. EVERY single character has a unique voice that's different, they all have a personality, and MY WORD does Hazama sound bloody awesome. Sometimes I wish that Ufotable would just take the dialouge, then animate it into glory. For most of the between people dialouge, I just sat back, closed my eyes, and after the end of their talking, casually hit the A button to proceed to the next. It's so much fun to understand this story.\n\nA flaw to this game however (and to MANY people) is that the story is quite frankly, complicated as stated before. Each characters story takes place at different set, key points, and if you don't have a guide on you, your gonna have a hard time pieceing the story together. To newcomers however I say --- DON"T GIVE UP!!! There is a magnificent story behind this game and you'll miss out if you don't work to understand!\n\nGameplay is the typical 2d fighting with various moves that are unique to each character. However, they all have a unique way of playing style, feel, reach, and all add some sort of variety to prevent that "stale" air of copy and paste fighting characters. That itself helped me like it more.\n\nFor those who know it, theres nothing like pulling off a Astral Heat against an opponent. Oh, the satisfaction.\n\nA great game that shouldn't be missed, wonderful story, characters, completely voiced, hilarity, fun gameplay, and more.","December 13, 2015","true","26.2"," 55 of 61 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","55","61","0","4"

For once, this is NOT a lazy rerelease of an already existing, outdated PC-port.

Story mode overall lasts 60+ hours with usually 3 different paths you can take as an individual character. Abyss mode is pretty fun.\nMultiplayer is good to play with friends at same skill level, but online netplay is really dead.\n\nOverall I totally recommend this game to anyone who's into anime fighting games.

The roster is filled with diverse characters (both in appearance and gameplay style), the visuals are top-notch and brought consoles to their limits, and the music (while not as good as Guilty Gear's) is memorable and appropriate for the characters/stages.\n\nAs for the porting job, ArcSys put in more effort with this PC port than any of their other port jobs, and it shows. Using their BlazBlue Calamity Trigger port for reference:\n\nThe many bugs present in BBCT (memory leaks, alt+tab graphic glitches, missing music) have been fixed\nAs a result performance is much smoother, and most halfway-decent setups can expect an uninterrupted 60FPS at all times\nArbitrary resolution support, allowing you to play in resolutions far beyond the console standard of 720p\nGFWL has been replaced with Steamworks-enabled netplay (which is very smooth)\nAs a result, BBCSE also has Steam Cloud integration and achievements\nA decent amount of bonuses for PC buyers (bundled soundtrack, art collection, complimentary Japanese voice DLC, Steam Trading Cards)\n\nIt's not a 100% perfect port, but it's more than passable; I've been able to have an enjoyable time with BBCSE without any major hindrance at all.

Online mode too!\n\nThis game actually has around 7 new characters total, the description compares it to Continuum Shift vanilla, which wasn't released on PC.\n\nA great fighting game with great flashy mechanics and great music. Even if you're new to the series or fighting games, Continuum Shift adds a good Tutorial mode, explaining the basics and advanced stuff, and even some character specific stuff.\n\nFor features, the Story Mode includes a retelling of Calamity Triggers' (the first BlazBlue) story, and the new stuff is told in the style of a visual novel with some fights in between and some choices too (some story paths lead to joke or alternate endings.) There's a Challenge mode which challenges you to perform combos, Abyss mode which is basically a long survival run where you can purchase items beforehand with points that are also used to buy unlocks in the Gallery, and the other single player arcade mode and Calamity Trigger stuff. The gallery still has sound test, the last time it appears in BlazBlue as of BBCP 1.1. This version is also more combo focused and sports a few mechanic tweaks that make it different to the other games in the series like the Guard Primer system only allowing a certain number of blocks from specific moves before a Guard Crush occurs.\n\nThe game appears to be the latest console version (seems like the part about Legion mode was removed from the product description and I don't see it unlocked or in the Gallery unlocks.) with fast load times.\n\nRunning on Windows 8.1, performance is good (60fps cap, 1080p available) but I can't say whether this game suffers from the issue Calamity Trigger does regarding PC uptime (I recently restarted my PC and Calamity Trigger ran fine before I tested Continuum Shift).\n\nUpdate: PC uptime as of this update is at 3 days, 8 hours, 30minutes~ Calamity Trigger performance shot down to 30 sometime within the last 12 hours that I last ran it, Continuum Shift performance is still hitting 60.

Now, that being said, this one is easily the best I've ever played. I picked it up on release, not expecting to play much of it, but after trying it out, I couldn't stop playing.\nParticularly, I found the story mode to be of the most interest, and boy, is it a good story, though, for me, It was a bit confusing, and hard to grasp until I learned more about the series.\n\nThe fighting handles pretty well, especially if you have a controller. The animation of the character sprites is wonderful in battle too, and the moves are all great to look at.\n\nWith a large roster of characters, you should have a fun time trying everyone out, and deciding which you like best. And every character has his or her own amazing theme music.\naccompanying the large character roster is a wonderful english voice cast, that I personally think fit each character perfectly.\n\nAs far as incentive to keep playing, there's the alternate endings in each characters story mode, And the gallery. There are hours upon hours of unlockables to be found in the gallery. Gallery unlockables consist of mostly wonderfully illustrated CG's, and some animated cinematics, which can be seen in story mode.\n\nThe only bad things I can really come up with, come with online play. I'm not sure if it even has an active online community, so finding a match against another player might not happpen. I could be wrong though.\n\nThough, there is one other downside I can think of. Some characters come off as terribly OP. Lambda 13 and Hakumen come to mind. (That or I totally suck against those two)\n\nSo, a summary of the pros and cons\n\nPros\n-Great voice cast\n-A good, but slightly confusing story\n-Large roster of fighters to toy around with\n-Hours of unlockable CG's\n-A great sound track\n\nCons\n-Some OP fighters\n-Not enough online players\n-The story is pretty confusing, and hard to grasp, even if you've played Calamity Trigger\n\nMy personal rating is 10/10\nUm...The official rating...8.9/10?

I'm also super biased when it comes to "anime fighters". So here's my honest opinion: This is game is too fast and too deep. Everything in this game happens at faster pace than that of Street Fighter, if this is your first anime fighter, dive in with a friend, or into network mode. This game favors unrelentless fast offense, crazy combo mashing and occasional smart defense. If this sounds like something you might like, then get over here. But don't expect to be reading your opponents until you're sufficiently capable.\n\nPlaying with a controller is the best idea here, or an arcade stick if you prefer. It's very hard to play competitively on a keyboard.\n\nThere is a lot to learn in this fighting game and, while the tutorial mode is very extensive, it is -unfortunately- super boring. After playing through it completely, I had forgotten mostly everything. Playing with someone else made me appreciate the intricacies of this game. Just pick Stylish mode Ragna (this game's "basic" character), go to Network mode, and mash some buttons. Eventually you'll get used to the pace.\n\nThen you can dive into the Challenges section. Which will provide you with ways to inflict damage. If you need more, there is YouTube. And after that, you can head over to Dustloop.com where anime weebs like me can teach you even more.\n\nThere is much to be said, but nobody will probably read it. Characters are very cute. Some music is very good. Story is a big time traveling joke to me that would fit in any anime perfectly (points for that). PC graphical options are just barely OK. Nice improvement from CT. There's good online (finally). Game is not the latest version though. Too expensive when the sequel is going for around the same.\n\nIn conclusion: Just buy this so the creators can bring Guilty Gear Xrd to PC. Which is what everybody really wants. Oh and this game's sequel too.\n\nPS. Play this in 720p or it's gonna look pixelated.","December 11, 2014","true","4.4"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","2"

So many non-believers scoffed and laughed at the thought of porting to PC. I told them steam was ripe for it. We were right: Finally...we're just 1 step away from potentially Chrono Phantasma (Extend) & HOPEFULLY Guilty Gear Xrd!!! Omfg...if that happened....I'd be so ♥♥♥♥ing happy. I'd pay my $60 or whatever (hopefully $49) and go about my merry way practicing combos. Both would be heaven.\n\nBut anyways review for this game? I've been playing Blazblue since Calamity Trigger, the first game was announced and I played on console. For a game period, the netcode on console was pretty damn good. As a port to pc and only the 2nd Blazblue port, there've been a LOT of improvements. Many bugs are gone, the game runs buttery smooth offline at 60 fps, and of course all the modes are included too. However, there are a couple relatively small issues:\n\n1. Not all resolutions are available.\n2. Apparently turning mic off for online ranked play isnt possible yet?\n3. netcode (for me) is very shotty (apparently other people say it's working wonderfully for them so good)\n\nThere's a couple other things, but I'd say they did a good job :) learned from the mistakes of the first game, so I'm REALLY hoping the next one will be almost perfect.

You'd have to experiment with different rooms and players to see who has a playable connection with you and who does not. There was also no way to stop laggy people from joining your room either.\n\nHowever, the recent online patch has fixed this issue. What really makes me happy though is not that it's finally fixed, but rather that the publisher, H2, was actually kind enough to release a patch.\n\nBut yeah, to get back to the general review:\n\n\nGAME OVERVIEW\n\nBlazblue is a renown 2D fighting game known for its stunning visuals and diverse cast of playable characters. Each character plays different from the next; you could be a god with a sturdy, defensive character like Hakumen but struggle with a puppet character like Carl. Each character has their own unique play style so choosing a main or finding the character that clicks right with you isn't very hard at all in Blazblue.\n\n\nOFFLINE CONTENT\n\nThere's tons of this. The tutorial does a decent job of explaining some of the game's basic mechanics and teaches you how to play Blazblue. It's kind of long, but well worth it if you're new to the game and interested in playing against others at a higher level. The game has a "Stylish Mode" for beginners who want to do combos but haven't learned the execution for them yet: it's a mode where you do small combos by just pressing one button so it's something quite nifty to have if you wanna just play this game at a party with friends or something. I do not advise you to use this often if you're trying to learn this game at a more serious level since Stylish Mode limits the players' overall options and makes the player do unsafe strings on block, which will lead to heavy punishes when facing an opponent that knows what blocking is.\n\nArcade mode is like any other run-of-the-mill fighter where you face off against nine rounds of opponents before fighting a boss character who has enhanced attacks and specials and boasts higher HP. Story mode is quite long. If you're interested in stories typical of anime and don't mind doing some reading, then Story Mode is definitely going to be enjoyable. There's Abyss mode too where you fight waves of opponents but pick up buffs and attribute boosters that increase parameters like damage, defense, and movement speed, giving this offline mode the feel of an action RPG almost.\n\nChallenge Mode is what you'll most likely be doing after finishing the tutorial. It's a mode where the game teaches you a few basic BnBs which are your main staple combo routes. It doesn't exactly tell you how to utilize these combos in an actual match though - that's something you're going to have to learn for yourself through experience and watching higher level players. Regardless, it's still a mode you're going to spend a few hours in if you want to start practicing some basic combos for a character you want to pick up and learn. Especially if you are a beginner to fighting games, you will be spending tens of hours in this mode polishing up your execution in this mode and it's very well worth it.\n\nTraining Mode is probably where you'll be spending most of your time offline if you plan on getting online. It's pretty standard as far as most training modes in fighting games go but is absolutely crucial if you want to improve or sharpen your skills. Besides combo practice, you can practice hit confirming by setting the dummy to Random block or you can practice your defense by utilizing the record function to recreate some sticky situations you might have found yourself in before.\n\nThe game also has a nice little gallery where you can unlock artwork or stuff like new color palettes in exchange for in-game cash that you can only get by playing the game.\n\n\nONLINE MODE\n\nThe netcode itself is good. The game is smooth as butter when playing against those who live in the same region. (3-4 bar connection) 1-2 bars are okay but it might be a bit more difficult to block things like standing overheads on reaction but besides that, are very playable. 0 bars are kind of a hit-or-miss. I'm a player from California and although my connections with Japanese players have been 0 bar this whole time, some JP connections honestly feel like 1-3 bars instead of 0. However, most 0 bars are going to be what the red bar suggests: barely playable to unplayable at all.\n\nWhat's also important to note is that unless you have godly fiber wifi or something, having a wired connection is almost necessary for playing online. The packet loss from playing on wireless can completely screw matches up even when playing against someone who lives right next door to you.\n\nThe online community itself is diverse. There are players from many different regions inhabiting Network Mode so as long as you don't live in some really distance place like Antarctica, you should be able to find some decent connections depending on the time of day. Skill levels are also all over the spectrum so don't worry about hopping online and getting destroyed by everyone.\n\nNetwork Mode has two types of battles: Ranked and Player Match.\n\nIn Ranked, your W/L ratio is tracked and you also gain these PSR points for your character at the end of every win; lose PSR at the end of every loss. You gain around 7-9 PSR per win and lose 2-4 PSR per loss until around you've played around 100 or so matches. From that point on, you'll only start gaining 1-2 PSR per win and only from fighting players who have a similar PSR rating or high win ratio. What's important to note however that PSR is only a rough estimation of skill; in no way does it actually determine if the player is good or not. While 750 PSR may be considered high and usually indicates that the player is decent, that 750 PSR player might have just gotten that number from farming off the same weaker players in Ranked or frauded their way to maintaining a high win record by disconnecting after every loss. That said, don't pay too much attention to Ranked in this game since you'll usually find much better quality matches in Player Rooms anyways.\n\nIn Player Match, you can choose from a list of lobbies that can seat anywhere from 2-6 people. There are many options you can choose from while creating a room like reserving invitation slots for friends or setting the rotations to Loser Stays or Random instead of the traditional Winner Stays. You can allow for Unlimited Characters to be used if you ever want to mess around with boss versions of characters against other people or set the room to display a "Beginners/Experts Only" icon that will (hopefully) attract the kind of players you're looking for. You can also rename your room too for w/e purpose you want. While waiting for opponents, you can also go into Training Mode (same applies to Ranked as well).\n\nPlayer Matches are where you can find most people playing. In Player Match, W/L ratios are not recorded and there is no rating system so you're free to play however you want. Create a friend-only lobby or duke it out with some randoms who might very well become good friends, rivals, or even mentors to you.\n\nOverall, the game's online is good and there aren't any real problems with it anymore.\n\n\n10/10 game's a near perfect port of the console versions. It might not be the most recent in the series but it's still a solid stand-alone fighter.","January 26, 2015","true","289.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

There's a lot to do in Continuum Shift, and you'll find the hours slipping away as you get sucked in.\n\nSuch as the extensive storylines with full voice acting. There's barely a time when you will be reading text without somebody speaking it. Not to mention the Japanese voice pack. Never before has a fighting game got me so invested in the characters with the story.\n\nI actually want to learn the details behind Carl's slow decent into madness and the story behind his puppet. I want to learn the story of Hellsing's past and where he got his werewolf powers. I want to know why Taokaka is so familiar with Litchi that she refers to her as "Boobie Lady".  To learn all this, you play their stories. And as you play their stories, you start to get good with the characters. This all translates into hours and hours spent playing the game. That alone makes the game a worthy purchase at full price.\n\nThere are only a few minor problems with the game. There is no option to turn off voice chat when playing online, which leads to hearing feedback from speakers because people don't realize their mic is on. Also, you'll be hearing "counter counter counter counter counter" so much that it seems like a gross oversight by the developers to leave that in the game. As far as I know, it's not exactly vital information and can be done without. Yet, you'll still have to put up with it.\n\nI've never been very good at fighting games, but I attribute that to never getting invested in them because of a lackluster story or characters that I couldn't grow to like. Blazblue is the first fighting game that I've put the effort into learning how to play, and it's actually showing! Because I love the characters, the story, the voice acting, the music, and all the extra features put into the game. Not to mention, the extensive tutorial that was missing for the previous game has been a life saver.\n\nMan, I just love this game.\n\n\n","January 15, 2015","true","9.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","0"

It includes all of the display options from the earlier Calamity Trigger port (which I was hoping for, in all honesty) and the gameplay itself feels as smooth as it did on the PS3. Netplay is also on-par with the console versions, which has led to some confusion due to the intense lag during the fight intro, which gives way to smoother connections during the fight itself. All-in-all, a good package.\n\nMy only real complaint about the game would have to be its price: maybe Arc System Works or H2 Interactive could've offered a cheaper "standard version" of the game, that would've removed the digital art book and soundtrack and dropped the price by $10 or so, but it's a little late for that. I'd recommend any die-hard fans of the series who want ASW to port more games to PC to pick this up ASAP (the 10% early discount [20% if you own BBCT] definitely softens the blow).

It boasts no carbon copy clones, a unique range of characters, the kind of deep combat you'd expect from a 2D fighter and some of the best voice acting yet. Hazama's three voice actors (Erik Davies, Spike Spencer, Doug Erholtz, it's complicated yo) seem to delight and enjoy their role with the utmost of glee. To count: we have a heterocromic vampire protagonist with pretty much the weakest key to the world, an ice knight obsessed with said protagonist, a catgirl with swords in her hands, a valkryie-esque knight, a dude in a suit with a butterfly knife, a red devil, a werewolf butler, a gothic lolita vampire (she's umpteen dozen years of legal yo), a knight in armor with a big-♥♥♥ katana, three asstasstic female weapons, Travis WillingHAM, a shota with his robotic sister, a squirrel girl (DAT TAIL DAT TAIL DAT TAIL), a magical girl, and a shapeless blob of buggy onslaughts.\n\nPerhaps the only sore point is the graphics, which don't do so good at 1080p. The sprite art and backgrounds are crisp... if you play at the game's native 768p. Playing at any higher introduces scaling artifacts which detract from the stellar design. For this reason I suggest running it in windows or unscaled fullscreen.\n\nIt also boasts over its younger brother (Nii-san!) the unmatched advantage of online play, and all the new CSE songs downloaded as extra content. The only sore point seems to be the price, pretty damn premium, but then again I did splash on the collector's edition on X360 so who am I to judge?\n\n10/10 Would 3C -> 214D-C -> 5C-> j.Cx5 -> j.214B again.","May 21, 2015","true","4.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Because of this, it makes a great entry point into the series for newcomers.\n\nThe story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world in which society has already been rebuilt and futuristic tech that runs off magic has been developed. The lore is quite complicated, but most of it is explained in the non-canon "Teach Me, Miss Litchi" segments, which consist of light-hearted skits performed by super-deformed versions of the game's main characters. Having the lore explanations separate from the main game allows for the main storylines to move at a decent pace. As for tone, there is a serious story in the game that is told in a serious manner, but there is also an abundance of humour and gag routes in the series.\n\nThe actual gameplay seems to cater to both hardcore competitive fighter fans and unskilled casual players (like me). Combos are easy to pull off and flow together well and the easy difficulty is rather easy. The game also features some more complex mechanics for the more hardcore fans and there is a ranked online mode so such individuals can really put their skills to the test.\n\nThe PC version seems to play just as well as the console versions. The 16 song soundtrack features the songs of the new characters and the opening to Continuum Shift 2. The opening to Extend, "Sōkyū no Hikari," and a special Ranga vs. µ-12 song, "Pandora Tears," are missing while an instrumental version of "Blue Bloom" titled "Spiral" is included. The music mostly focuses on a mix of orchestral metal and a bit of pop. The bonus art is all highly compressed into one PDF file and I recognize most of it from the in-game gallery.\n\nHighly recommended to all but those who already own it on other platforms.","December 15, 2014","true","25.9"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

It now toggles between 60fps and 30 randomly! Hahaha! Now it's just un♥♥♥♥ing playable.\n\nAfter sinking quite a bit of time into both Playstation 3 and VIta versions, I think I can safely say this is one of the best Blazblue(s?) in the series, if not one of the best fighting games of all time.\n\nPort report: No major problems. No lag spikes. Minimal customization of graphics, but it's not like you need much in a 2D sprite based fighting game. The graphics are intensely detailed and are quite a treat to look at. The game itself includes a story mode, which, if you happen to enjoy anime, would probably appeal to you in some fashion. It's bright, flashy and confusing, but it's a good story nonetheless (and the games are in order according to the story, looking at you, Street Fighter.)\nI haven't tried out online play yet, but I plan to later in the day. From the other reviews on Steam, it's pretty bloody excellent.\n\nWhile the 30 dollar price tag is going to scare away a lot of people, I would pick it up. It's currently 10% off, which softens the blow a bit. If you bought Blazblue Calamity Trigger, either through a Bundle or through Steam, you get the game 20% off, bringing the price to an attractive $23.99.\n\nPick it up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/294810/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account","\nBlazBlue: Continuum Shift Extend, which I’ll refer to as CSE from now on, is a 2D fighting game by Arc System Works which has been on the consoles for a while, but was recently ported onto Steam for Windows following their success with their port of the first game in the series, BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger.\nGameplay\n\nA lot of people find it rather difficult to play fighting games using the Mouse and Keyboard setup, so the game does support controllers, along with local versus mode so you can play against your friends. When compared to other fighters such as Street Fighter, Blazblue’s mechanics are more complex and deeper so its not as great of a pick-up for players looking to learn how to play fighting games but like all things, if you’re dedicated enough to practice, you’ll be able to play the game no problem, though it may take some time compared to people with experience in other fighters. However, if you’re just looking for casual play with friends,  the game comes with a beginner mode, called Stylish, which gives the user one-button combos, similar to Persona 4 Arena’s combat system. ss+(2014-12-12+at+07.48.55)Whether you’re new to the BlazBlue series or fighting games in general, CSE offers a fairly in-depth tutorial on the game’s mechanics and general advice for each character in the game so players wanting to learn the franchise can do so without pressure in the tutorial and training modes.\n\nOther gameplay modes included in the game are:\n\nVersus – A standard 1v1 match against a friend or a computer.\nScore Attack – 1 player fights various computer controlled characters to get a high-score.\nUnlimited Mars – Score Attack with smarter bots and enemies have stronger and alternate abilities.\nChallenge – 1 player attempts to perform combinations of moves (combos) fluidly on a passive bot.\nAbyss – A pseudo-dungeon where players can buy upgrades to their characters to fight against regular and Unlimited Mars\n\nFor collectors, you earn currency to buy items with in the gallery, such as the boss characters from Unlimited Mars and the Story, artwork, and additional voice-packs. In addition to all these extra modes that provide plenty to do, especially if you’re still a beginner and have a hard time completing certain modes, the game also comes with a story mode, which I thought was rather long and text-heavy for a fighting game. Some people may like it, others probably won’t since fighting games aren’t usually known for their story. The story is fully voiced in English, also Japanese as DLC which is currently being included for free, presented in a similar style to visual novels, with the character model appearing on screen standstill, and occasional artwork.\n\n2014-12-12_00004\n\nThe game’s main story is coherent enough and even gives you a playthrough of the previous games’ main plotline, but the writing itself made various out of place references to internet culture and was, in general, so bad that you hope they were trying to be ironic. They have to be right? No one could possibly think naming your main character The Bloodedge was a good idea. Right?\n\n2014-12-12_00005\n\nApart from the main storyline, is a series of lore, entitled, Teach Me Miss Litchi!, which doesn’t offer anything in terms of gameplay, but creates some humorous skits and touch upon the world’s lore, which I admittedly do not follow very well since anything that has to do with multiple universes and time travel just flies right over my head.\n\nThe game’s online is rather barebones, but functions without any major hiccups. The standard amount of settings for 1v1 versus like, the number of rounds, duration of each round, how many players can be in the lobby, who gets to participate in the next round, usage of special characters, and whether to make a private/public/ranked (to play for Player Skill Rating and earn a spot on the leaderboards) lobby are all included, but not much more.\nGraphics\n\nBeing a 2D fighter, the game’s graphics were never that demanding to begin with so being on the PC doesn’t offer as much in terms of graphical improvements as it would with other genres. While it does output in “native” 1080p compared to the consoles’ 720p output, it doesn’t seem to do anything as the graphics both in-game and in the menus look identical to their console counterparts, even with Anti-Aliasing set to 4x (the maximum the game allows).\nClick on the image for a full-size view.\n\nClick on the image for a full-size view.\n\nThe artwork and in-game backgrounds are very visually appealing, but doesn’t really mean much when the in-game character models and even the menus are so jagged.\nAudio\n\nThe game’s voice acting was done fairly well in both the English and Japanese dubs of the game. I thought the game’s soundtrack was really solid, but lacked variety as  pretty much every track in the game was a variation of fast-paced, anime theme song, so people who don’t enjoy that style of music probably won’t enjoy this game’s soundtrack either. The game’s sound effects were varied enough too so you have a good idea of what’s happening and won’t get confused by the verbal diarrhea that tends to occur when people start executing faster combos since all the game’s characters seem to love shouting out what move they’re using.\nVerdict\n\nOne of the issues of the game I didn’t talk about previous was that this was a port of a game originally released 4 years ago on consoles, with the DLC included in the Extend edition only being a year younger. In that time, consoles have already received the series’ next installment, Chronophantasma, which is likely to be ported onto Steam eventually as well. The game also carries a $30 price point on Steam while you could it for $20 on consoles rather easily.\nPros\n\nA lot of game modes\nGreat soundtrack for fans of anime-style songs\nGood art direction\nA fairly detailed story mode for a fighting game\nVery deep game mechanics\n\nCons\n\nNot as many characters compared to other fighting franchises\nCringe inducing writing\nNo real graphics upgrades from the console version so everything looks jagged and blurry\nNo variety in the soundtrack\nBarebones online\nOutdated game\nPrice point\n\nBlazBlue: Continuum Shift Extend is an extremely solid fighter in terms of gameplay mechanics and the variety of modes you can play offline, however the game’s online features are rather minimal and despite the upgrade from console to PC hardware, no real improvements are made to the game’s visuals. The game is also a hard sell since the game’s price point is extremely high for a port of a 4 year old game, especially when you know the sequel is already out on consoles and probably will be ported to the PC as well. If you’re looking a relatively challenging, fast-paced fighting game and don’t mind the game’s cost despite being outdated, CSE is definitely a game you should pick up, and a solid:\n8/10\n","May 1","true","7.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Very different and fast-paced. This was my first and only BlazBlue game as of now and I am looking forward to playing more games in the series.\n\nThere are only a few things that I can recall that I do not like about this game. All of which have to do with voices. Not to be confused with the voiceovers during a match, those are fine. The story mode drags because of the super slow voiceovers. The voice actors themselves sound great. But it feels like there was no forethought of how the lines would fit together and be paced in the game. It feels even slower than a TV soap opera. Also, the tutorial has the same effect except you can skip through it more easily. Yet you don't really want to blow through the tutorial if you're trying to learn it all... so the plus-side of being able to skip isn't very applicable. I can't emphasize enough how annoying the voiceover in the tutorial is, which is done by the character, Rachel Alucard. Her voice is fine, it's just that it is SO slow. As far as I saw there is no option to turn down just her voice or to turn it off completely. When you're reading along her voice usually lags way behind and it can trip you up when you read ahead which has the side effect of forcing you to follow at her snail pace. I'm not one to pick things apart unless they are really annoying. And the slow character voices... are really annoying.\n\nEverything else is freakin' awesome.

Very different and fast-paced. This was my first and only BlazBlue game as of now and I am looking forward to playing more games in the series.\n\nThere are only a few things that I can recall that I do not like about this game. All of which have to do with voices. Not to be confused with the voiceovers during a match, those are fine. The story mode drags because of the super slow voiceovers. The voice actors themselves sound great. But it feels like there was no forethought of how the lines would fit together and be paced in the game. It feels even slower than a TV soap opera. Also, the tutorial has the same effect except you can skip through it more easily. Yet you don't really want to blow through the tutorial if you're trying to learn it all... so the plus-side of being able to skip isn't very applicable. I can't emphasize enough how annoying the voiceover in the tutorial is, which is done by the character, Rachel Alucard. Her voice is fine, it's just that it is SO slow. As far as I saw there is no option to turn down just her voice or to turn it off completely. When you're reading along her voice usually lags way behind and it can trip you up when you read ahead which has the side effect of forcing you to follow at her snail pace. I'm not one to pick things apart unless they are really annoying. And the slow character voices... are really annoying.\n\nEverything else is freakin' awesome. Great fighter!","December 14, 2015","true","24.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Your mileage may vary I suppose. SPLENDID music.\n\nSTRONG POINTS:\n-Varied characters, each character plays differently. From Taokaka's lightning fast dashes and strikes to Tager's slow but strong smashes and Hakumen's counter based fighting there's lots to pick from\n-The music. I can't stress this enough, it fits perfectly and sounds very good.\n-Lots of unlockables and achievements to keep it fresh and to give players things to aim for\n\nWEAK POINTS:\n-Netcode can get stuttery. This will mess you up if someone lags online or has a weak connection.\n-Some characters feel slightly overpowered, but this can become bearable with enough experience.\n(screw you tager)\n\nPick this up, maybe get it for a friend or two too, you will have lots of fun if you like fighting games.\nHell, it has lots of content in singleplayer too, but nothing beats the feeling of playing with friends.\nVerdict: GET","December 30, 2015","true","25.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"

It could be difficult at first, but once u learn the basic and headed to challenge mode you will be fine in no time. They also have stylish mode for beginer or if u just want to smash button for fun.\n\nThe artwork is great, if you like anime styled character you will probably like the character. It also has decent story with ingame visual novel style (8/10 for story).\nThe netcode is working fine, but no1 play ranked match which is sad (where are you people??). People still play normal match though which is great.\n\nThe only problem I have is the display ratio, since the game doesn't allow me to adjust the ratio, I use my monitor scale ratio which is sometime work and sometime doesn't. But it is not game breaking.\n\nOh also good controller is very recommended for this game. Using keyboard is fine (not recommended) but of course a fine keyboard. Making a mistake is something you don't want in this game.\n\nnew note: They will release Blazblue Chronopantasm Extended soon. If u want to enjoy the story u have to buy at least BB continuum shift.

I did not have crashing issues like many others on here have; but I did have extremely low FPS that made it unplayable, it was like playing it in slow motion. I thought ok, maybe this game is just really slow, then looked at the videos and saw that the action is really fast paced, while for me the gameplay was crawling. My PC has better than minimum settings and there's no reason the game shouldn't have performed well. I looked online for solutions to this and saw that I wasn't the only person having this problem, tried the fixes recommended online and nothing worked. I do have 2 graphics cards (laptop) integrated and Nvidia GT650m, tried switching from integrated to Nvidia, that didn't work either (most basic attempt to fix you'd think would solve it). After about an hour of trying to make it work, I just gave up and got a refund as it shouldn't be so difficult to make a game playable and I just didn't want to deal with it anymore. It's a shame too, this game seems great.

Otherwise, uh, have fun with your game that luckily works for you?\n\nThe game is rad, but this port is terribly sloppy.  There are like, six companies that make decent arcade sticks for the PC, and unless you happened to buy a stick that is XINPUT friendly (which, if you have a PS3/PC compatible joystick it won't be!), good luck mapping your buttons to anything that makes any sense whatsoever.  I literally couldn't get this game to recognize the start button on my Qanba Q1 (a fine joystick that works great with Skullgirls or USF4), and had to use some sort of DLL wrapper workaround to get it to recognize any inputs at all.  After much fussing around, I was able to get something acceptable, except for the fact that one of the attack keys was irrevocably bound to the "record dummy action" key in training mode, and another was bound to "play recorded action".  So you can just imagine for yourself how that went.  This is not a difficult problem for Arc System Works to fix, and yet here we are, several months after release, with nothing. I hope that they will be more considerate in the creation of future PC ports of their fighting games, because their games are actually quite good (as I'm sure this one could be!).","November 18, 2015","false","1.3"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/guardspec/recommended/294810/","guardspec","Guardspec","http://steamcommunity.com/id/guardspec/","214 products in account","The following is my PERSONAL opinion! (Originally posted on 05/05/15)\n\nPros:\n\n- The game looks gorgeous from it's jawdropping animation to the meticulously crafted backgrounds.\n\n- A healthy cast of 19 characters to choose from. Each with unique, distinguished visual style and fighting mechanics. Everyone is fully voiced in both Japanese and English so you can choose in what language you prefer to hear them.\n\n- Surprisingly good and deep story for a fighting game, presented in a visual novel style. As an added bonus you don’t have to buy the previous installment, Calamity Trigger, because the entire story mode is included here too!\n\nCons:\n\n- Some characters feel cheaper in comparison to others. While e.g. Tsubaki, Makoto or Hazama rely on skilled gameplay, understanding and positioning to succeed, other character like Tager or Ragna can steamroll you with two or three moves clumsily strung together.\n\n- The story ends on a cliffhanger only to be continued in Chrono Phantasma, which (as of 05/05/15 still) is a PS3/4/Vita exclusive. If you are interested in the game’s lore, you will have to wait for a future port, buy a console or read up elsewhere to know what’s gonna happen next.\n\n- While the single player content is abundant, it feels like pointless padding. Unlimitedmars is a carbon copy of Score Attack on highest difficulty. The Abyss mode is another score attack, presented as a tedious gauntlet of matches where you fight increasingly difficult AI. Why Challenge mode was separated from the Tutorial section is anyone’s guess, you’ll only be learning character specific combos there.\n\n-The controls in this game are terrible! You need to have an arcade stick or a very twitchy controller to perform some of the ridiculous character inputs. If you, like me, play the game casually on a keyboard, you are screwed because nearly every special move will be difficult to perform. This is also something that Calamity Trigger suffered from, I am sad to see these issues not resolved in the sequel.\n\n- The multiplayer is abandoned. I had the game for nearly a week and tried to combat some people online during various hours of the day. There were never more than 5 lobbies available which I could never enter due to some dubious connection issues. Nobody joined my lobby while I had it open for more than an hour at a time. The same applies to Ranked mode, I had the queue running for hours and only gotten one match from someone and afterwards we could never connect again after trying a bunch of times.\n\nThe verdict: I unfortunately can’t recommend this game. While the presentation is superb, the core of the game, i.e. fighting other players online, is missing. If you enjoy sitting in an empty online lobby by yourself or are satisfied with fighting the computer AI, the game could be worth your time, maybe.","May 19, 2015","false","50.1"," 9 of 29 people (31%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","31","9","29","0","0"

Not only that, but it is quite expensive, and the soundtrack, while great, is not worth the price.\n\nIf it goes on sale for really cheap, I recommend buying it just for the soundtrack and maybe the story mode (if you're patient enough to play through the lag), but skip it otherwise.","September 30, 2015","false","11.4"," 1 of 12 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","12","0","0"

It is "technical", but it's enjoyable, you can make small combos without much effort (of course, mastering it is very hard, but a noob like me won't be frustrated when playing against AI). I'm coming from a SF style of fighting, and I recommend this one. If you like anime, so, don't wait anymore and get it. (not to mention the amazing music). I'm a PC player only, so I can't compare with the consoles, but I play with a Xbox Controller. I didn't played online yet. I'm still too noob to try. :D","January 14, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although the background textures aren't amazing, a lot of crazy stuff can go on in dem backgrounds. The resolution settings don't present you with a lot of options, which may be disappointing for some of you. The online network mode also has some flaws, as the settings are very basic, not really allowing you to fight other players in specific regions, and no option to turn off chat within matches (which could potentially get very annoying). I should also mention that the player pool for online play isn't really expansive, as few rooms with specific match settings accepting other players show up, and the the whole "player skill matchup" feature is either hit-or-miss. Even if set to "same strength as me" or "stronger than me," chances are you may run into unknowledgable players or god-tier masters, because the player pool is small. Even though this is isn't the latest in the series, it's still enjoyable and comes with a lot of content, being both friendly to both people who know zilch about 2D fighting games and those who are veterans, as they have a tutorial for you fledglings as well as a lot of content and changable difficulty settings for the hardcore audience. The story is extremely complicated, which is something me and my fellow players never really bring up.

Determined by me and many of my friends to currently be the most balanced (this is before the NA release of BBCP2). That being said I feel the NA price point of this steam release is a bit steep. The game probably should've been priced at 15USD and included the soundtrack with the jp voices. As for the online, I don't like that they removed the connection conditions to rooms that existed in the ps3 version. Because every now and then someone with a low connection to me will join and bog down the entire experience. Another thing is you can't leave rooms while a match is started even when you're a spectator... I'm currently running this game at 1080p 61 fps [full] windows 7 64bit with well over the required specs and it has only crashed once so stability doesn't seem to be a problem. For my last minor annoyance when configuring your buttons you have to press R1 to switch to the device that you want to configure at first I had no idea and it doesn't seem very obvious either. BlazBlue remains to this day the only fighting game I enjoy and literally can't put down.

The two puppet characters) I have owned this game for only a few days now and I already clocked 10 hours. The story mode is long as ****.\n\nThough there are all these good things, the amount of flashing lights and random graphics were something to get used to. Once I had gotten used to them it was very hard to go back to Mortal Kombat! It just looked so bland in comparison.\n\n10/10. Would ruin my apeal for other fighters again.\n\nPS. I do get this problem that is kinda bugging me. I cant alt+tab out of the game when it is fullscreen without the game crashing.

I've seen videos on it, I've heard people talking about it. So when I got a system that could play it, I bought it. Sadly it was for the Nintendo 3DS meaning I could not play with others online, just local. Not to say BlazBlue was bad on 3DS, just it could of been better, though too be fair it at least had an animated background unlike a certain Street Fighter port. . . For 3DS. Well my 3DS broke a couple months ago so no more BlazBlue for me, as well as other games I loved playing on that system. But then I saw that BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend was released for PC and so I used the money I made from selling my most prized possession in all of Gaming to get BlazBlue. . . and other games. Well how is it? Basically the same really, there's probably some technical changes but overall everything seen in Continuum Shift II is all here, the only true noticable differences will be the intro cinematic and the addition of a new character, Relius Clover, or Carl's messed up Father who thought it be cool to turn his Mom and Sister into puppets. BlazBlue can have a heavy story line, or be not-serious-at-all comedic. But who plays games these days for Story? Well you'll probably get curious on it eventually because why not? But out of seriousness the Story will be long, doesn't matter which character you choose so may want to have some snacks around. Although there will be Gag stories which sometimes they're funny and other times they're just, eh. And then there's the arcade mode, you played Street Fighter? Same thing. Only different here is you can do Fatalities. Okay so they call it an Astral Finish but still it's the one move that can instantly finish off a character in an epic display. . . except Arakune who turns into a giant floating ball. Speaking, the characters, you'll either love them or hate them. Each character is different than the other, and each character has a very different personality. From Ragna's troubled ego, Jin's super obsession, Taokaka's hyperactivity, and of coarse Hazama's trollish attitude. And then there's the character who you can't tell the gender because BACKSTORY. . . also has a clear Male and Female voice which reason for being is (again) Backstory. Then there's the special content where you can see concept and fan art as well as seeing some shorts about the series. BlazBlue is clearly not going to be for everyone out there, but it's still a fun game none-the-less. You'll get a sense for other large name games while playing a different game. I say at least try it if you ever get that chance.","November 11, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The actual gameplay/combat is exceptional, and since its a fighting game that (of course) matters the most. But I really wanted to give it a thumbs down because of how absolutely terrible the story mode is. It's like watching a low quality anime with hundreds of dialouge boxes that you have to shuffle through. On top of that, most of the characters were stupid and uninteresting. The english voices are extremely annoying and made me want to play the game without any sound. Just like a lot of anime there are a bunch of made up words thrown in your facee to make it seem like the plot is well thought out and original (but its not). All of the characters are rehashes of typical anime character roles. All dialouge that is not focused on the story is typically boring and useless. I found myself skipping past entire conversations between characters without any consequences because again, a lot of the dialouge is pointless. Was the story worth my time? No. Did I enjoy playing through the story mode? Not even a little bit. The A and RT buttons on my controller are broken from how much dialouge I skipped. Is the actual fighting fun and high quality? Yes. That's the only reason this review is a thumbs up. Plus there are other game modes so the story isn't really a big deal anyway.","November 22, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its great story, amazing characters, fast-paced and relatively well balanced gameplay, and deep mechanics made it my all time favorite video game series. As much as I love and recommend the series, I'll give you a few warnings though:\n\nThe story is really big and complicated. Even though this game has a bonus story mode that sums up the events thus far, it's still pretty hard to follow. I recommend taking a look at the wiki if you're interested.\n\nIt's pretty tough to learn and very hard to master, especially if you're new to fighting games. Particularly so if you're looking to master an exceptionally demanding character like Carl or Arakune.\n\nThis is not the newest version of the game. In fact, there are two more versions of the game past this (BlazBlue: Chronophantasma and BlazBlue Chronophantasma: Extend, neither of which are available on Steam yet).\n\nThat being said, I can't recommend this game enough.

Continum Shift Extend ? Wow , everybody believed it would never be released ,  and i have currently it in my library . As a great fan of the first game , BB Calamity Trigger , i will be quick on the pros of one of the greatest fighting game ever made :\n\nPros:\n-a technical , and yet easy-to-learn gameplay . Lots of combos and strategies , but beginners won't be lost.\n\n-BBCT lacked of characters  , but with this game you get the double of playable characters ! ( and each of them are unique and full of charisma : contrary to other mainstream fighting like Street Fighter , the fighters have personnalities and you can see it simply through their sprites and animation ! ( i particularly appreciate Hazama , the great evil of this sequel ^^ )\n\n-A long , rich story mode , full of humor and serious plot ( but only if you love japanese anime like me ^^ )\n\n-A bunch of contents , like CGs , videos , modes  and so on.\n\n-Oh , and about the musics... They ROCK !! every character have their own ost , and some special ecounters (ex: Jin vs Ragna) have their unique battle theme . One of the best ost ever made for a fighting game ( but hey , ACS also made the Guilty Gears series , they know their job when it deals with making rock , metal epic themes )\n\n-2d sprites are beautiful , the 3d backgrounds too and the design of the Blazblue world is somehow unique in its type\n\n-And the best for the end : ONLINE MODE ! missing in the first game , network features come back in this sequel . And now that they fixed the early issues , it works perfectly.\n\nCons:\n\n-The story is  complex and hard to understand , even though you played the first game ( but the story remains great ,and worth it )\n\n-You must appreciate mangas / anime design ( i know not everybody appreciate it ... )\n\n-Some bugs from times to times\n\n- That's all !\n\nConclusion : CCCSE is an upgraded version of the first BB game : more characters , more features , online mode , solid gameplay...\nThe game worth it's 27,99 $\ni will give it a honorable 9/10\n\nNow let's just have fun fights while waiting for ChronoPhantasma Extend , the third and ultimate version of the BB series !","June 30, 2015","true","29.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its great story, amazing characters, fast-paced and relatively well balanced gameplay, and deep mechanics made it my all time favorite video game series. As much as I love and recommend the series, I'll give you a few warnings though:\n\nThe story is really big and complicated. Even though this game has a bonus story mode that sums up the events thus far, it's still pretty hard to follow. I recommend taking a look at the wiki if you're interested.\n\nIt's pretty tough to learn and very hard to master, especially if you're new to fighting games. Particularly so if you're looking to master an exceptionally demanding character like Carl or Arakune.\n\nThis is not the newest version of the game. In fact, there are two more versions of the game past this (BlazBlue: Chronophantasma and BlazBlue Chronophantasma: Extend, neither of which are available on Steam yet).\n\nThat being said, I can't recommend this game enough. In my opinion this is the best fighting game series ever made and if you're even remotely interested in the genre I think you should give it a try!","November 28, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One thing I found cool is the story mode has an individual story for each character, albeit the story mode is more of a visual novel with several fights thrown in.  If you are more prone to button mashing than learning combos, the game has a "Stylish" mode, which lets you execute complicated button combos by simply spamming any key. Overall, I really enjoy the game. It has a unique story with likable characters and fun combat.","May 30, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wanted to say heavy metal album! N... no, wait. wait! I'm there! Exceptional 2D fighting game! Yes, this is it!\nOkay, okay, not many people play fighting games for the plot... but BlazBlue: CSE could be the exception to the rule :3\n\nPROS:\n* smooth gameplay;\n* amazing story (with optional "gag reels");\n* unique characters (almost everyone of them has to be played in a different way);\n* over-the-top finishers (the Moon is crumbling!);\n* ridicolously good soundtrack (seriously, it would be worth the price even only for that);\n* anti-stress features which transforms the gameplay from Street Fighter-like to Devil May Cry-like (stylish mode anyone?).\n\nCONS:\n* certain characters require lot of time to master, especially for casual players like me (CAAAAAARL! YOU AND YOUR @#*§ DOLL!);\n* stringing combos together and learning how to do the Distorsion / Astral Heat moves can be sometimes frustrating (again, only for the casual player) - but at least, it's rewarding when you are able to unleash a 20+ combo without having to use Stylish mode :3\n\nRecommended? Absolutely yes if you love fighting games, anime, visual novel or metal music.\n\nAs a side note, I would really recommend to play story mode, even if you are on the "competitive" side: Terumi is one of the most well characterized manipulative bad guys I've ever found in a game.

I've seen videos on it, I've heard people talking about it. So when I got a system that could play it, I bought it. Sadly it was for the Nintendo 3DS meaning I could not play with others online, just local. Not to say BlazBlue was bad on 3DS, just it could of been better, though too be fair it at least had an animated background unlike a certain Street Fighter port. . . For 3DS. Well my 3DS broke a couple months ago so no more BlazBlue for me, as well as other games I loved playing on that system. But then I saw that BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend was released for PC and so I used the money I made from selling my most prized possession in all of Gaming to get BlazBlue. . . and other games. Well how is it? Basically the same really, there's probably some technical changes but overall everything seen in Continuum Shift II is all here, the only true noticable differences will be the intro cinematic and the addition of a new character, Relius Clover, or Carl's messed up Father who thought it be cool to turn his Mom and Sister into puppets. BlazBlue can have a heavy story line, or be not-serious-at-all comedic. But who plays games these days for Story? Well you'll probably get curious on it eventually because why not? But out of seriousness the Story will be long, doesn't matter which character you choose so may want to have some snacks around. Although there will be Gag stories which sometimes they're funny and other times they're just, eh. And then there's the arcade mode, you played Street Fighter? Same thing. Only different here is you can do Fatalities. Okay so they call it an Astral Finish but still it's the one move that can instantly finish off a character in an epic display. . . except Arakune who turns into a giant floating ball. Speaking, the characters, you'll either love them or hate them. Each character is different than the other, and each character has a very different personality. From Ragna's troubled ego, Jin's super obsession, Taokaka's hyperactivity, and of coarse Hazama's trollish attitude. And then there's the character who you can't tell the gender because BACKSTORY. . . also has a clear Male and Female voice which reason for being is (again) Backstory. Then there's the special content where you can see concept and fan art as well as seeing some shorts about the series. BlazBlue is clearly not going to be for everyone out there, but it's still a fun game none-the-less. You'll get a sense for other large name games while playing a different game. I say at least try it if you ever get that chance.","November 11, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, this is it!\nOkay, okay, not many people play fighting games for the plot... but BlazBlue: CSE could be the exception to the rule :3\n\nPROS:\n* smooth gameplay;\n* amazing story (with optional "gag reels");\n* unique characters (almost everyone of them has to be played in a different way);\n* over-the-top finishers (the Moon is crumbling!);\n* ridicolously good soundtrack (seriously, it would be worth the price even only for that);\n* anti-stress features which transforms the gameplay from Street Fighter-like to Devil May Cry-like (stylish mode anyone?).\n\nCONS:\n* certain characters require lot of time to master, especially for casual players like me (CAAAAAARL! YOU AND YOUR @#*§ DOLL!);\n* stringing combos together and learning how to do the Distorsion / Astral Heat moves can be sometimes frustrating (again, only for the casual player) - but at least, it's rewarding when you are able to unleash a 20+ combo without having to use Stylish mode :3\n\nRecommended? Absolutely yes if you love fighting games, anime, visual novel or metal music.\n\nAs a side note, I would really recommend to play story mode, even if you are on the "competitive" side: Terumi is one of the most well characterized manipulative bad guys I've ever found in a game.

Of course, lots of great fighters, story modes, unlockables etc etc...\n\nA classic...and a good warm up for Chronophantasma! :)","June 1","true","26.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
