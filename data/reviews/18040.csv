Or should I just call you Tina? I am DEATHSPANK, vanquisher of evil, dispenser of justice and a hero to the downtrodden. Review this game you say? Who needs reviews when we can have disco night? I, DEATHSPANK slay my enemies with impeccable grace while also looking good in purple (no actual chickens were harmed in the duration of this game). My goal is to find THE ARTIFACT, which I need, because of reasons, while my source of power comes from a special thong as well as a finely maintained dental line. But the most important thing of all is that where DEATHSPANK is involved, justice is served just like my tea: with two sugars, a little lemon, and a splash of milk.","November 26, 2013","true","13.0"," 58 of 70 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","58","70","7","0"

Both titles combined humor to great effect with the Monkey Island characters being particularly self-aware that they were computer gaming characters.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=351722667\nIn an attempt to re-create the success of Guybrush Threepwood (Monkey Islands main lovable but bumbling buffoon of a wanna-be-pirate hero) we now have Deathspank (another bumbling buffoon of an idiot wanna-be-hero). Swapping out Shafer, the Caribbean and adventure gaming in general, Deathspank introduces us to its titular character and fantasy setting with a combat heavy action role playing focus. But does Deathspank have what it takes to enjoy the same sort of longevity as Guybrush Threepwood?\n\nUnfortunately not. Whilst the game may illicit the odd smile here and there, as a character he is missing the charm that accompanied Guybrush on all of his adventures. With a forced script, the gags don't really tend to flow very well most of the time and Deathspank eventually ends up being more of an irritation than anything else. WIth a stupid and idiotic quip for almost everything you do in game be prepared to have some bad comedy laid down thick and fast throughout your playthrough.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=351723125\nDeathspank is nothing more than a Diablo clone except this time it's dressed up as the court jester. As far as the game goes the gameplay is pretty solid and engaging if it were not for the idiot of a hero unable to shut his trap for a single second. The store page lists the epic humor of Ron Gilbert as one of its main key selling points but to be honest I was totally underwhelmed by this attempt at so called humor. I have gotten more laughs from just staring at a lemon going off in a fruit basket.\n\nGraphically the game looks quite unique with the entire world made to look like card board cut outs and it lasts roughly 10-14hrs hours which is just about right when looking at the games asking price.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=351724563\nWhilst I am a huge fan of Guybrush Threepwood and the Monkey Island series, I definitely am not as ardent a Deathspank fan. Fun in short little bursts and thankfully over quickly I wouldn't recommend paying full price for the title but wait for a sale instead.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","June 13, 2014","true","18.0"," 41 of 55 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","41","55","0","2"

And orphans. It's a simple action slash RPG game that does all the heavy lifting for you. All the armor and weapons you receive upgrade automatically, and really the only effort you need to maintain your inventory is making sure you have enough space for everything. There are a lot of side-quests but mostly all of them are pretty simple and straightforward, and aren't really necessary in completing the game. This is a funny game with an outrageous plot and wacky characters, so it just wants you to sit back and have a good time. It's not trying to be more than what it is, and it knows that. I recommend playing the game on Hard if you want some sort of challenge, reading every dialogue option to get the most out of the humor in the game, and to take your time. You can get all the achievements in one play through and it's really all you need.","December 23, 2013","true","12.9"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

Plenty of bad guys, loot, and, uh, snacks await you on this epic quest.\nEnvironments, items and enemies offer plenty of variety. In terms of replayability, there is not much to be had there--although the game may be worth revisiting after a year or two have passed. Multiplayer feels like an afterthought, but it is actually possible to have an (offline) friend assist you at all times.\nFor your money, you're looking at around 6 to 10 hours of gameplay (depending on how you play it and if you want to do all the side quests). You decide if it's worth it. While you're at it, you might want to buy the sequels (DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue and The Baconing) along with this game, or else the ending (or lack thereof) may disappoint you.\nFor me, the verdict is clear: It's great.\n\nWorks flawlessly in WINE, too.","November 27, 2015","true","10.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

It has nice cartoon style graphics which just fits perfectly with the colorful world. The atmosphere is really pleasent and the soundtrack is pretty enjoyable while killing creatures. The combat system is fun because it's pretty easy, like the game itself, actually. However, there are some difficult quests which will take you a little more time than usual to beat them. The dialogues are interesting and also, there is a plenty of jokes in them. The characters are interesting, well designed and voice-acted good. Also, there are many items to collect, many weapons to fight with and some delicious food to feed your hungry belly and restore some of your health!\n\nOverall, I'd say the game is a little bit childish, but it doesn't matter, because it's super fun.

I love this series, though, I did not like the fact that eventually the game starts to get so much more difficult as you get to the mid to higher levels. Now I am not so wimpy that I cannot handle a challenge, but in some areas, you will be swarmed by enemies, some or all of which are tough enemy types, such as the tough mother spider types (it has been a while since I played so I forget a lot of the enemies) and the Jotuns. Yes, they will have minion types with them that just die in a few hits, but then you get swarmed by a bunch of regular spider types or jotuns or demons or w/e, and you are toast.\n\nNow, maybe I am missing something, and there is a trick to it to avoid getting swarmed like that and dying, a lot. But for me, if I die too many times, then it is no longer fun for me. I am not saying I don't like challenging games, I do, I just hate dying every 5 minutes or so, or dying until I figure out the secret... I am in no way saying that makes this game bad, it doesn't, I am saying I am probably a bad player. If you are a fan of crude humor, hilarious plot lines and quests, and hilarious weaponry and quest rewards and action RPGs, then this is your game. If not, or if you are like me and are not a fan of dying, a lot, then this may not be your game, still worth looking at though, to see if you will like it.","August 12, 2015","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imban/recommended/18040/","Imban","Imban","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imban/","1581 products in account","DeathSpank is a thoroughly mediocre action RPG that takes after Diablo but never manages to be all that entertaining.\n\nProbably my biggest mechanical issue with the game is the itemization - there's no randomly generated loot, and almost all items are just straight upgrades that require higher levels to equip. The only exception to these are the weapons which allow you to use your Justice Meter, which also have tiered upgrades, but deciding which of them to use is actually slightly interesting - though I found the spinning swords to be the best of them by far, to the point where I didn't really use the others much. This also affects the stores in the game, which have very little worth purchasing until you're level 18 and can just buy the best equipment in the game - before that point, items are far too expensive, don't offer a huge benefit (unless, as it did for me, the game basically refused to ever drop crossbows for you) and will likely be replaced quickly with items dropped by monsters or found in treasure chests.\n\nWith the itemization out of the way, the game is on the simple side - except for a few difficulty spikes like the Pip Village, I found Normal to basically be walking through the early game and killing everything in 1-3 hits, and later doing it just as fast from range with the crossbow. There's a variety of consumable items, but I only really used the healing items because it didn't seem like I ever really needed any of the others, or had a clear idea of when element resistance potions or whatnot would even have been useful. So, yeah. The combat wasn't terribly interesting, and neither were the rewards for the combat.\n\nThe parody elements were occasionally amusing, but frequently fell flat for me - that you're going on a set of stupid fetch quests isn't made any better by the game calling attention to how stupid the fetch quests are, for instance. It's one of my gripes about parody RPGs in general, that they frequently seem to think that it excuses replicating bad game design for the sake of parody. Some of the more puzzle-like quests were amusing, however, and weren't something I was used to in this type of game.\n\nUltimately, DeathSpank is the kind of game I would mostly suggest trying if you think its style of humor would appeal to you. It doesn't really stack up well without that. (Unfortunately, it also seems as if DeathSpank never goes on sale any more, from what I've heard? So I can't even really suggest picking it up on the cheap, even though it's over five years old now.)","December 2, 2015","false","7.1"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

It took me about 7 hours to beat the game and I felt bored about 30 minutes during that time, because I had no idea where to go in a certain quest. It's a pretty casual game execpt for 1 or 2 monsters in particular which are quite unbalanced and can cause problems.\n\nThat game is very hard to review, because, while I had alot of fun and didin't see the time go by... The gameplay is very repetitive and there's not enough weapon variation and different ''skills'' in the game, in my opinion. Shoot until the monster gets to you, smash, smash, block, smash, block, smash, monster dead... That's what you do for about half of the time.\n\nI do believe it's worth playing, because of the dumb humor that's just wrong and funny...

I got the first Precipice game in a bundle and just gave it a try, then after finishing bought the others.\n\nThese are all great games, I love the 2D artwork and the way the whole thing is put together. For instance, mall details like when you switch weapons you see Deathspank wielding it in the preview (I know this is common among the bigger game developers but for a relatively unknown game maker it is nice to see that they created a finished rather than a rushed product) .\n\nUnfortunately the screenshots alone do not do these games justice since you are not aware of the funny dialogue (if the first game wouldn't have come with the bundle, I bought, I probably wouldn't have tried them at all).\n\nDeathspank is secondly a hack and slash. Although you die rather frequently (ok, I die rather frequently :-) ), you will just respawn close by so it isn't such a big deal. Personally I have set it to the easy setting and then it should be playable by anyone, I think.\n\nI really love all of these games and finished ORSPD 1 and 2 twice (note that I didn't play ORSPD 3 and 4 because these are different kind of games with retro graphics)  and Deathspank 1 once.\n\nI would recommend any of them if you enjoy a not so serious game with lots of fun dialogue.","October 18, 2014","true","66.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very obvious it's from an Indie developer; the controls are kind of odd, but you can rebind them, or just ignore them like me and hack and slash your way to over 200k damage taken (no death statistic is terrible). The fact that you can't actually turn off click-to-move except while holding down a key is awkward. The music gets repetitive after a while, and it might get confusing as to where to head next. And the questing system is just your generic boring questing system. But where Deathspank shines most is the dialogue, oh my God. Even most item descriptions are pretty random and humerous. The graphics are pretty nice too, I like them, and I also like the very original enemy types (Kangamoos, Bearalopes, and Sabretooth Donkeys come to mind). Dragons look kind of strange, more like reptilian orcs than anything else, but all the others are just amazing and perfect.

This game is actually hilarious throughout whether it's a Peter Griffin-style quip or shooting chickens out of a handheld cannon. The quests are the standard kill/collect format but the premise behind them is often so creative and hilarious that it completely makes up for the lack of innovation. There are tons of weapons and armor to find although the majority of what you will use is gotten through quest rewards. The art style is as perfectly stylized as Psychonauts and even the music feels distinctly Deathspank.

One quest giver sends you to the same place, to fetch one item at a time, at least a half dozen times. It's obviously tongue-in-cheek, but the irony wouldn't wear so thin if it didn't apply to most of the game. Also, it's sometimes unclear what you are supposed to do. You will probably find yourself hitting the online guides two or three times. I wouldn't recommend it for a hard core RPG or action player. However, Deathspank is a solid, funny local coop game if you play with someone younger, and it works much better with the gamepad than first-person games do. My seven year old had a blast playing it with me. If you are okay with exposing a kid to cartoonish violence and some mildly crude humor, and don't feel an obsessive need to slogh through every sidequest, you should give it a shot.","January 2, 2014","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very obvious it's from an Indie developer; the controls are kind of odd, but you can rebind them, or just ignore them like me and hack and slash your way to over 200k damage taken (no death statistic is terrible). The fact that you can't actually turn off click-to-move except while holding down a key is awkward. The music gets repetitive after a while, and it might get confusing as to where to head next. And the questing system is just your generic boring questing system. But where Deathspank shines most is the dialogue, oh my God. Even most item descriptions are pretty random and humerous. The graphics are pretty nice too, I like them, and I also like the very original enemy types (Kangamoos, Bearalopes, and Sabretooth Donkeys come to mind). Dragons look kind of strange, more like reptilian orcs than anything else, but all the others are just amazing and perfect.

Well worth it -- made by Ron Gilbert, creator of Monkey Island, this game retains his humour (well, an updated version of it), but the puzzle element is somewhat reduced (impossible 'add this to that' puzzles are banished), a massive 3D world to explore (with extraordinary and innovative use of 'scrolling' 2D artwork in it), lots of weapons, fighting, banishing of demons, collecting of guts and mating glands, and general heroic heroism -- all in the name of finding The Artifact.

It combines the mechanics of Zelda and Diablo with the sly humor of Monkey Island's Ron Gilbert. A silly, forgettable, but altogether enjoyable storyline for this first installment of two will run you about 20 hours to fully enjoy. Combat mechanics work great when paired with the X360 controller, as that's what the game was actually designed for.\n\nDeathspank is a must own -- and since it's indie, it's cheap. While it's not your standard $50 experience, it's definitely worth the ~$15 or so it usually sells for. Pick up both Deathspank games for an interesting and humorous gaming experience you may actually enjoy playing.","March 19, 2011","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ivory_soul/recommended/18040/","ivory_soul","Ivory_Soul","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ivory_soul/","316 products in account","The Good: Hilarious dialog, great voice acting, charming art style, tons of quests, enemies, weapons, and items, huge open world to explore\n\nThe Bad: Constant healing gets extremely annoying, killing enemies gives you very little XP, gets repetitive after a while, some quests are vague on where to go\n\nDispenser of Justice! Hero of the Downtrodden! Those are just a couple of DeathSpank’s other names in this hilarious action RPG from Hot Head Studios. You play as the silly hero DeathSpank in his quest to find The Artifact and kill the evil king Lord Von Prong. LVP wants DeathSpank’s magical Thong to become more evil, but in the mean time you need to do some saving of the downtrodden.\n\nThe overall story isn’t much, but the banter with NPCs is what really makes you crack up with the obvious stabs at RPGs and other games. It will take different shots at the genre without even saying anything some times like one quest has you pleasing an orphan in the Demon Mines to put in your orphan bag. You must run into town and get everything she needs, but the store just so happens to have everything you need when you get there like a cell phone and a pony! This is an obvious jab at RPGs whose stores always have what you need.\n\nThe game also has some more childish jokes like collecting unicorn poop, finding help letters in dragon poop, and helping villagers make their dirt and stone soup taste better using various animal parts. While this humor may not be funny to all, most will get a kick out of it and DeathSpank is chalk full of it. Of course the gameplay is important to and DeathSpank lets you assign four different weapons at a time to use and there are a ton of weapons, armor, and different types of potions to use. You can even eat various foods to heal up like pizza, fries, magic mushrooms, and root beer. When you whack enough enemies you get to unleash your Justice meter which are power-ups for certain weapons. The game consists of a huge map that you can wander around and travel via outhouses spread throughout the world. There are a ton of quests and you’re looking at about 10-15 hours of gameplay here that is very entertaining.\n\nThe game has two major flaws and this is the fact that no matter how high you level up or how good your armor is you will be guzzling potions and healing items every 5 seconds. Enemies re-spawn when you re-enter an area and you can’t move on to some until you are a higher level or those enemies will kill you quickly. This makes progression slow at first and forces you to complete quests because that’s the only way to really level up. You get very little XP killing enemies even if they are a higher level than you. I found this very frustrating and made the game less enjoyable because of all these weird quirks. I also found that some quests were vague on where to go and using fortune cookies spread around give you hints, but those are just mostly useless.\n\nThe visuals are nice, but technically the game is very simple, but there is a huge variety in enemy types and you really won’t get bored on that end. The best part about DeathSpank is the humor in the dialog and the funny voice actors who over exaggerate voices. Even as an action RPG the game is fun and challenging for anyone looking for something out of the ordinary to play, plus it has co-op play for anyone wanting to share the fun and jokes with a friend.\n\n--Score: 8/10","June 28, 2012","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Thats good though because instead of making a game that eats graphic processors alive they made it to look as good as the game needed it. But where this game truly shines is in it's humor, The main villain looks like a wimp, the artifact of ultimate power is called "The Artifact" and to top it off the hero is kicking all of this ♥♥♥♥ while waring No Pants!\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, my chickens and I have some killing to do.","January 12, 2011","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fun, it's witty, and it's so self-aware that it'll make your brain hurt sometimes. This game flows really well. There aren't any clunky or unwieldy elements, and you will move along merrily from quest to quest without having to do many of the annoying dungeon crawler tasks- like selling off vendor trash. The interface is sleek and the combat is intense, and Deathspank himself may be the most awesome cliched hero tough guy ever. The only thing bigger then Deathspank's jawline is how big the dent in the floor will be after you fall over laughing. Oh and play the sequel too, since it's more of a Part 2 to this game then a sequel, per se.","January 3, 2011","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Way too silly and tongue-in-cheek. The weapon variety is a little stale. This would be a decent purchase if you enjoy exceedingly over-the-top silly, but otherwise there's not much particularly remarkable. The humor was a bit hit or miss at times. Felt similar to Torchlight in terms of camera/controls. The game itself wasn't bad, but there wasn't as much depth as I'd prefer with weapons/abilities/etc., and the humor didn't tickle my fancy much.","August 18, 2011","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Too many Diablo clones harp on the same narrative of beyond monotonous versus good and evil, some kind of BibleThump storyline where you have to rid the world of neckbeard skeletons. Pretty annoying, but Deathspank is pretty comedic, satirical and Adult Swim so these are good attributes to have.\n\nDunno why the devs are so stingy on putting the expansions on sale though, been like 5 years, Jiminy Christ.","April 21","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
