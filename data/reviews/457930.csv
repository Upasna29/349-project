"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kagespartan/recommended/457930/","kagespartan","Lord Crocosquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kagespartan/","881 products in account","This was the first of two reviews I did on Livestream yesterday, nearly a week from the time it was supposed to be released.\n\nIn the twenty-four hours since that stream went live, both this game and Krog Wars went live on Steam, and now I can do an official review. I've spent a few minutes with the Steam version, and I've found this one somewhat improved from the version we used on the Stream.\n\nThey corrected exactly one bug, that being the one where the Game Over screen requires that you shut down the game and restart it before you can play again. This had the expected side effect of correcting the High Score saves, which isn't a bad thing. So, they get that much credit.\n\nFor those of you who have played Hovering Heli Death, this game will look somewhat familiar-- That's because it is. It's a direct asset swap with the other game, including the project name in the title bar in Windowed Mode. The game itself is horribly optimized, with Fastest graphics being almost unplayably fast, and the Best setting being almost the opposite.\n\nA video record of the stream in its entirety can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_CCsNv9NUM\n\nAgain, this game's pre-release review has been shifted to the "General Discussions" forum, which is NOT visible if you don't already own the game. This IS a form of censorship, and I have zero issues calling it out.\n\nFortunately, the consumer can look at regular reviews prior to buying the game, so I paid out money again so that you can have the warning you deserve. This particular game should not have been made, and although they did fix one issue,  it's a far cry from producing a good game.","April 12","false","0.2"," 105 of 120 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","105","120","4","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/demonswordgames/recommended/457930/","demonswordgames","Demon Sword","http://steamcommunity.com/id/demonswordgames/","78 products in account","Where to Begin.\n\nWell my first reaction is featured here: https://youtu.be/Uqd1avAS7YE    Albeit it heavily edited. (Dont worry though, I kept the burps in)\n\nBut those of you not wanting to hear my nasally voice :\n\n1)First and foremost I feel like this was falsely advertised, I not once encountered asteroids or enemy ships\n\n2) This game is ugly, the lighting, the atmospher is non existent and even the space ship looks more like a shuttle at best.\n\n3) This game performs like utter s*** I tested on both a windows 8 laptop and a windows 8 virtual machine, both had access to dual core intels with 8GB of ram and a competent graphics card, (note that this 2d abysmal space shooter shouldnt require more than at best 2GB) It ran poorly at all times.\n\n4) The screen is limited to X number of bullets. This means that if you hold the mouse button you will blast too many bullets and the furthest ones just disappear.\n\n5) The blue enemy bullets dont seem to make it accross the screen, the go from right to left and make it maybe 20% of the way before vanishing.\n\n6) The red enemy bullets make it approx 80% of the way, this means that in most cases I could avoid damage by simply positioning the ship at the furthest position left.\n\n7) Your first run starts you with 3 lives + your starting life (total of 4) but any run additional starts you with just 2 for some reason.\n\n8) There is a highscore board with no highcores and seemingly no way to post your score.\n\n9) If you die, it goes all the way back to the beginning, and i have to sit through your digital homicide splash screen each time.\n\n10) When you die, the screen goes black and you have an explosion animation - You guys cant even script it so the ship itself exploads, it has to load up a cutscene to represent the ship exploading.\n\n11) You respawn exactly where you died meaning the enemies can land some cheap shots.\n\n12) Your stupid F***ing Unity pregame screen. Sid Alpha has pointed this out on all of his reviews of your games, and noted your overall laziness with it. This is a new low however as  IT SAYS HOVERING HELIDEATH IS THE TITLE\n\n13) Lets talk about titles. The store front calls it Starship Alpha strike, the unity pregame menu calls it hovering helideath and the titlescreen calls is NOTHING Are you guys really  This  lazy?\n\n14) The controls are very stiff and static. Meaning that there is no acceleration, you push WASD to move at a steady speed in the given direction.\n\n15) You're charging money for this.\n\n16) Your Lasers arent lasers, theyre some generic 'fairy dust' effect you got from the unity store.\n\n17) Speaking of lasers, they dont fire from the correct position if you are moving upward they fire from the bottom of your ship, if you are moving downward they fire from the top. When your engine adds the laser object it doesnt take into account ship movement which is below amateurish\n\n18) Speaking of lasers - Do you know what makes these types of games fun? Power ups!\nIt is such a common mechanic to have stacking power ups - Faster firing rates, Spread shots, Wave Shots, Back lasers, Arching lasers, Homing missiles, Multi blasts, charge shots,  Freezing shot... Of course this game has nothing to it so my guess is that power ups wouldnt add that much\n\n\n19) its only 1 f***ing level - Call this a runner if you want, to me that just shows how pretentious and slimey you are capable of being. It's not under developed, its a runner! Give me a break. The sad thing is that Newgrounds and Kong feature hundreds of similar games that are better in every regard. FOR FREE\n\n\n....Unbelievable...","April 13","false","0.4"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","32","39","0","1"

When I covered Krog Wars, I learnt that they had not made any sort of improvement. However, Starship is a slightly different story.\n\nIf you've read Kage's review of this, you know that they fixed 2 issues in this game that we covered in the stream. The first issue was the fact that once you hit the game over screen, you hd to restart the game as you were stuck on that screen. The second issue was that the high score board at the beginning also didn't work as a result of the game needing a restart. Now here's something that I was surprised that Kage missed in the Steam version. When they fixed these issues, a few new issues came up. Even though they've fixed the issue to make the high scores appear (which they didn't in the itch.io version), they messed up the coding to stop adding on from ur previous high score. In other words, whatever score you got on the previous round, it keeps that score for the next match as yur starting score. In the itch.io version you had 3 lives. In the Steam version, you still technically have 3 lives but it's actually 2. Basically when I fired up the Steam version of the game, I was faced with a black screen for maybe 5 seconds and it said tht I died and I lost a life and this happened each time the game launched up. Some of the missiles also randomly dissappeared in the middle of the screen. In addition to all of this, I experienced alot of lag when I was shooting missiles, making the game drop to 30 and sometimes even 20 fps.\n\nThis game is a waste of money and that's the only thing I can call it. For the deal of 47p it's a waste of money. For 1p, it will be a waste of money. Only consider picking this up if it's free and then consider to change your mind.\n\nMy curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","April 13","false","0.7"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","21","27","0","0"

There are 7 types of the enemies. 4 of them are asteroids from Asteroid Pack 01 by Dark Anvil (5,5 Euro on Unity Asset Store).\n2. I have less fps in 1366x768 than in Dark Souls, Borderlands the Pre-Sequel, L.A. Noire or Alan Wake - and none of thease games are propelly optimised, but all ot them looks better. 60 fps in Lords of the Fallen? No problem. 15 fps here? Usually... It is probably the fault of participle systems. Replacing those with texture based animation could make all the difference in the world.\n3. Fire rate seams to be frame rate independant, movement speed seams to be frame rate dependant. Compared with point 2 guess how it works out.\n4. Some enemies and enemy projectiles dissapear in mid screen. Probably their timer runs out, because it only happens in low frame rates.\n5. There is only one level.\n6. In low res it looks much worse than 1994 Raptor Call of The Shadow. It plays much worse too.\n7. The only music track is about 7 seconds long. There are also 5 more sound effects.

On Unity Asset Store you can find almost identical energy shield and space ships for less than 10 Euros each. It looks like this game is about 20-30 Euros worth of assets and 2-4 hours long tutorial.

Looks good.\n\n\n- Hear about Frankie?\n- Yeah.\n\n\n- You going to the funeral?\n- No, I'm not going.\n\n\nEverybody knows,\nsting someone, you die.\n\n\nDon't waste it on a squirrel.\nSuch a hothead.\n\n\nI guess he could have\njust gotten out of the way.\n\n\nI love this incorporating\nan amusement park into our day.\n\n\nThat's why we don't need vacations.\n\n\nBoy, quite a bit of pomp...\nunder the circumstances.\n\n\n- Well, Adam, today we are men.\n- We are!\n\n\n- Bee-men.\n- Amen!\n\n\nHallelujah!\n\n\nStudents, faculty, distinguished bees,\n\n\nplease welcome Dean Buzzwell.\n\n\nWelcome, New Hive Oity\ngraduating class of...\n\n\n...9:15.\n\n\nThat concludes our ceremonies.\n\n\nAnd begins your career\nat Honex Industries!\n\n\nWill we pick ourjob today?\n\n\nI heard it's just orientation.\n\n\nHeads up! Here we go.\n\n\nKeep your hands and antennas\ninside the tram at all times.\n\n\n- Wonder what it'll be like?\n- A little scary.\n\n\nWelcome to Honex,\na division of Honesco\n\n\nand a part of the Hexagon Group.\n\n\nThis is it!\n\n\nWow.\n\n\nWow.\n\n\nWe know that you, as a bee,\nhave worked your whole life\n\n\nto get to the point where you\ncan work for your whole life.\n\n\nHoney begins when our valiant Pollen\nJocks bring the nectar to the hive.\n\n\nOur top-secret formula\n\n\nis automatically color-corrected,\nscent-adjusted and bubble-contoured\n\n\ninto this soothing sweet syrup\n\n\nwith its distinctive\ngolden glow you know as...\n\n\nHoney!\n\n\n- That girl was hot.\n- She's my cousin!\n\n\n- She is?\n- Yes, we're all cousins.\n\n\n- Right. You're right.\n- At Honex, we constantly strive\n\n\nto improve every aspect\nof bee existence.\n\n\nThese bees are stress-testing\na new helmet technology.\n\n\n- What do you think he makes?\n- Not enough.\n\n\nHere we have our latest advancement,\nthe Krelman.\n\n\n- What does that do?\n- Oatches that little strand of honey\n\n\nthat hangs after you pour it.\nSaves us millions.\n\n\nOan anyone work on the Krelman?\n\n\nOf course. Most bee jobs are\nsmall ones. But bees know\n\n\nthat every small job,\nif it's done well, means a lot.\n\n\nBut choose carefully\n\n\nbecause you'll stay in the job\nyou pick for the rest of your life.\n\n\nThe same job the rest of your life?\nI didn't know that.\n\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\n\nYou'll be happy to know that bees,\nas a species, haven't had one day off\n\n\nin 27 million years.\n\n\nSo you'll just work us to death?\n\n\nWe'll sure try.\n\n\nWow! That blew my mind!\n\n\n"What's the difference?"\nHow can you say that?\n\n\nOne job forever?\nThat's an insane choice to have to make.\n\n\nI'm relieved. Now we only have\nto make one decision in life.\n\n\nBut, Adam, how could they\nnever have told us that?\n\n\nWhy would you question anything?\nWe're bees.\n\n\nWe're the most perfectly\nfunctioning society on Earth.\n\n\nYou ever think maybe things\nwork a little too well here?\n\n\nLike what? Give me one example.\n\n\nI don't know. But you know\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n\nPlease clear the gate.\nRoyal Nectar Force on approach.\n\n\nWait a second. Oheck it out.\n\n\n- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!\n- Wow.\n\n\nI've never seen them this close.\n\n\nThey know what it's like\noutside the hive.\n\n\nYeah, but some don't come back.\n\n\n- Hey, Jocks!\n- Hi, Jocks!\n\n\nYou guys did great!\n\n\nYou're monsters!\nYou're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!\n\n\n- I wonder where they were.\n- I don't know.\n\n\nTheir day's not planned.\n\n\nOutside the hive, flying who knows\nwhere, doing who knows what.\n\n\nYou can'tjust decide to be a Pollen\nJock. You have to be bred for that.\n\n\nRight.\n\n\nLook. That's more pollen\nthan you and I will see in a lifetime.\n\n\nIt's just a status symbol.\nBees make too much of it.\n\n\nPerhaps. Unless you're wearing it\nand the ladies see you wearing it.\n\n\nThose ladies?\nAren't they our cousins too?\n\n\nDistant. Distant.\n\n\nLook at these two.\n\n\n- Oouple of Hive Harrys.\n- Let's have fun with them.\n\n\nIt must be dangerous\nbeing a Pollen Jock.\n\n\nYeah. Once a bear pinned me\nagainst a mushroom!\n\n\nHe had a paw on my throat,\nand with the other, he was slapping me!\n\n\n- Oh, my!\n- I never thought I'd knock him out.\n\n\nWhat were you doing during this?\n\n\nTrying to alert the authorities.\n\n\nI can autograph that.\n\n\nA little gusty out there today,\nwasn't it, comrades?\n\n\nYeah. Gusty.\n\n\nWe're hitting a sunflower patch\nsix miles from here tomorrow.\n\n\n- Six miles, huh?\n- Barry!\n\n\nA puddle jump for us,\nbut maybe you're not up for it.\n\n\n- Maybe I am.\n- You are not!\n\n\nWe're going 0900 at J-Gate.\n\n\nWhat do you think, buzzy-boy?\nAre you bee enough?\n\n\nI might be. It all depends\non what 0900 means.\n\n\nHey, Honex!\n\n\nDad, you surprised me.\n\n\nYou decide what you're interested in?\n\n\n- Well, there's a lot of choices.\n- But you only get one.\n\n\nDo you ever get bored\ndoing the same job every day?\n\n\nSon, let me tell you about stirring.\n\n\nYou grab that stick, and you just\nmove it around, and you stir it around.\n\n\nYou get yourself into a rhythm.\nIt's a beautiful thing.\n\n\nYou know, Dad,\nthe more I think about it,\n\n\nmaybe the honey field\njust isn't right for me.\n\n\nYou were thinking of what,\nmaking balloon animals?\n\n\nThat's a bad job\nfor a guy with a stinger.\n\n\nJanet, your son's not sure\nhe wants to go into honey!\n\n\n- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.\n- I'm not trying to be funny.\n\n\nYou're not funny! You're going\ninto honey. Our son, the stirrer!\n\n\n- You're gonna be a stirrer?\n- No one's listening to me!\n\n\nWait till you see the sticks I have.\n\n\nI could say anything right now.\nI'm gonna get an ant tattoo!\n\n\nLet's open some honey and celebrate!\n\n\nMaybe I'll pierce my thorax.\nShave my antennae.\n\n\nShack up with a grasshopper. Get\na gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!\n\n\nI'm so proud.\n\n\n- We're starting work today!\n- Today's the day.\n\n\nOome on! All the good jobs\nwill be gone.\n\n\nYeah, right.\n\n\nPollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,\nstirrer, front desk, hair removal...\n\n\n- Is it still available?\n- Hang on. Two left!\n\n\nOne of them's yours! Oongratulations!\nStep to the side.\n\n\n- What'd you get?\n- Picking crud out. Stellar!\n\n\nWow!\n\n\nOouple of newbies?\n\n\nYes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!\n\n\nMake your choice.\n\n\n- You want to go first?\n- No, you go.\n\n\nOh, my. What's available?\n\n\nRestroom attendant's open,\nnot for the reason you think.\n\n\n- Any chance of getting the Krelman?\n- Sure, you're on.\n\n\nI'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.\n\n\nWax monkey's always open.\n\n\nThe Krelman opened up again.\n\n\nWhat happened?\n\n\nA bee died. Makes an opening. See?\nHe's dead. Another dead one.\n\n\nDeady. Deadified. Two more dead.\n\n\nDead from the neck up.\nDead from the neck down.
