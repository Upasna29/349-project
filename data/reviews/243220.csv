The gameplay is solid with no bugs and so different from any other game out there to date. If I had to compare it to something I would say it is similar to the later Mysts but with music and synths and neon like Tron.\n\n\nThe sound is very well incorporated into the game world and is a (if not the) key feature in the game. It is a great game and a good introduction on using synths to someone who is not that musically inclined but would like to produce some music for personal pleasure, this is due to the game teaching you how to use the synths in the in game open world which is very pretty and gives a solid feeling of being inside a synth machine or computer but it is also abstract enough that I spent a number of hours just wondering around the world looking at it.\n\n\nThe tools that the Devs give you in game in the studio are simplistic but can provide a massive array of sounds and beats. There is also the option once you have completed the game to change the studio area to a more complex almost akin to a number of programs out there. The Devs have done an outstanding job with it all the puzzles are of good difficulty and any that have been troublesome to many of the beta testers they have improved (without making them straightforward) to the feedback given to them by the community and I have an honest feeling they will continue to do this once the game is released.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/243220/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","The marvel of Fract OSC struck me to the point of immobility.\n\nStanding within its world of organic sound and breathing architecture, I often found myself unconsciously freezing in place as a dormant level stirred at my approach, erupting into an awe-inspiring display or neon lights and blaring synths that sent goosebumps down my neck. I’d drift into obscure corners and onto meaningless ledges just to see what was there, being astonished at even the smallest piece of a world that seemed impossibly connected and alive.\n\nPlaying Fract made me feel alive in a way I haven’t experienced in a very long time. There’s so much energy in the air, twisting its way through structures and along the ground to create a world that feels as if it’s constantly in motion, adjusting and changing as so many wondrous sound bellow through the caverns. Fract isn’t just a giant synthesizer, it’s raw emotion flowing through bass lines and echoing synths that shakes the very floor you’re walking on. Every structure is its own sound, adding notes to the beautifully coordinated melody that grew with every step I took and machine I set in motion.\n\nFract provides almost zero assistance in helping you solve its humongous musical contraptions, but the way in which each puzzle builds off the last creates a persistent logic that grows with you as you begin to understand it more. Each object is introduced slowly enough to allow you to learn how to interact with it, but Fract never wastes time repeating itself. Instead it seamlessly folds areas and elements into each other so I was always learning something new even when I didn’t realize it, each puzzle pushing me just enough to feel stimulating but never overwhelming. You can almost feel Fract diligently holding itself back, clearly capable of so much more but always hyper aware of what constitutes “enough” as it cleanly bypasses the excess of many puzzle games with its extraordinarily tight pacing.\n\nBeing at the center of all this noise, attempting to conduct instruments I had barely begun to understand, I was struck by how small and powerless I was when compared to the monstrous amplifiers all around me. Even as I was helping to revive a world which had gone to sleep, I couldn’t shake how immensely alone I felt. All around me were unbelievable sights moving to a soundtrack that was itself alive within these walls, but there was no one to share it with; not a single soul anywhere to be found in this isolating cavern.\n\nThe feelings Fract created in me were powerful and complicated. The wonders of its design contrasted with the crushing emptiness I found growing within me the more I played. It filled me with amazement and yet all I wanted to do was cry. What was the point of any of this if it meant spending an eternity in solitude?\n\nFract OSC is everything I expected it to be: clever, gorgeous, innovative, inspired. But I wasn’t prepared for how it would affect me on a deeper level. Without even meaning to I was suddenly examining parts of me I couldn’t make sense of; things I didn’t want to acknowledge or feel comfortable sharing here. It’s an incredible game for so many reasons I’ve sold short here, yet somehow it’s the things I couldn’t see or hear that meant the most.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","June 2, 2015","true","6.2"," 38 of 40 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","38","40","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cheesecake_Recipe/recommended/243220/","Cheesecake_Recipe","A Victim of Stars","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cheesecake_Recipe/","882 products in account","Static washes out your vision, slowly fading away to reveal large and impossible geometric objects reaching up and out as far as you can see. Dead machinery jutting out from pastel colored ground and rock. You don’t know how exactly you got here nor how any of these strange constructs were built. Your legs carry you across the land, poking your head into enclosed buildings that might as well be giant tombs. At last, you come across an object that emits a strange hum. You touch it and the hum changes pitch slightly in reaction. You move it around and it changes tempo and pitch respective to where it was before. You don’t know what is going on but you sure as hell are nodding your head.\n\nFRACT OSC is like a Fantasia for the dance-minded music fans. IDisneylandM, if we were to give it a genre tag in our music player. Much like the Aggro-crag, every area on the map is color coded according to the theme of the sounds you’ll expect to hear. Pink acts as your bubbling leads, blue as your bass and green as the airy pads. Each instrument has its own dedicated area in the mountain area FRACT takes place in. The leads come from such towering heights, the pads sit in the middle and the bass rumbles on from down below. There are other, smaller details which show themselves to musician and non-musician alike which key you in to each place’s role in the overall scheme of what is going on.\n\nExploration is only one part of what makes FRACT tick. The tock of the metronome comes from the game’s puzzles. Each instrument has a specific puzzle type which increases in difficulty as you progress through them. The block movement and pad rotation puzzles were fine, but the last laser puzzle in the bass area had me tearing at my hair a while. Overall though I didn’t find any of them prohibitively difficult (though the ease of a majority of them may disappoint hardcore puzzle game fans) and FRACT always allowed me the freedom to leave any given puzzle to explore at my leisure. I would have to come back to it eventually if I wished to see the end, but the lack of pressure really goes a long way towards making even the hardest puzzles easier to forgive. I’m glad to see games like FRACT and Ether One taking this stance.\n\nThe way the sound design is so keenly and closely tied together with the puzzles was enough to make me smile as every solution came together. Starting off in an area, the puzzles were very basic and the sounds those areas produced once fully activated reflected that. By the time you’ve hit the end of the series of puzzles for a given color/instrument, the puzzles have added new mechanics over time and the resulting sounds that blast forth have additional layers of complexity. It really builds up a feeling of progression. Instead of a simple pat on the back for completion and shoving the player towards the next goal, you’re allowed to enjoy the fruits of your labor.\n\nAs you complete puzzles which slowly teach you vital elements of constructing tunes you unlock various tools to use in the in-game Studio room. The further into the game you get, the more you’re allowed to add and tweak into the track as you work. It starts off small with only a single loop sequencer and bare minimum controls over the tone of the digital instrument. By the time you’ve completed the entire game, you’re handed an impressively beefy DAW that looks as awesome as the sounds you’re able to make with it. While it is still limited and won’t replace your Reason, ACID or even your old copy of Fruityloops burned to a CD from a decade ago, it serves as an excellent introduction into the world of digital audio production. FRACT OSC is really a musical instruction tool masquerading as a videogame. To make things even better, the game has a built in export function and the dev is totally cool with users making commercial tracks so long as the loop work done with FRACT’s samples were all done in-game. A tutorial to mod in your own beats has been promised as well.\n\nBy the time I reached the end of my musical journey my ears were ringing and I felt similar to those nights after a gig. I’d emerged from the 8 hour rave session that I conducted for myself and myself alone, nary another ear to hear what reverberated through the cavernous area but my own. With every box aligned, switch flipped and cogs rotated I had brought life to these dead hills. As though Holy Mountain had been redone as a living Demoscene file, I had seen the secrets of this strange land from the very tip of its highest cliff to the very bottom of its deepest trench. I overlooked all that I had conquered and felt that it wasn’t quite enough. I retreated back to my lair, dark and still, slaving away for hours on what was to be my next song. I’d earned the right to control this giant machine and make it bend to my will. If only because I demonstrated that I understood what it wanted.\n\nIt wanted to make you move.","October 11, 2014","true","11.6"," 42 of 47 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","42","47","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/internisus/recommended/243220/","internisus","internisus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/internisus/","2421 products in account","In FRACT OSC, you explore a desolate alien landscape littered with derelict machinery, beautifully realized by simple untextured polygons shot through with neon and displayed using a graphical filter reminiscent of CRT interlacing.  Rods of light, pulsating liquid columns, and crystal lattices respond to your proximity with bursts of sound, the stuff of music flowing forth from the ground beneath your feet, waiting to be harnessed and organized.\n\nAs you wander, you make inferences about the structure of the world and the function of its technology.  You notice visual cues that prompt you to engage your interact mode in specific places, and you discover various pieces of information or interface superimposed upon objects around you.  Before long, you begin figuring out how to get things working again, and this abandoned place pumps and glows with activity and color.\n\nIn the course of solving the world's puzzles and restoring its infrastructure, you construct bits of music through devices that teach you the basics of music programming while incorporating your solutions into the soundtrack that results from the reactivation of key facilities.  Sound is all generated on the fly using a unique music engine that is constantly working in the background, and, as if the game itself wasn't enough, FRACT OSC doubles as a robust synth sequencer with exporting and automated YouTube sharing functionality.\n\nPlaying FRACT OSC has been one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences of my life.  I have felt so much wonder and joy while discovering its intricately crafted and interconnected world.

FRACT does not go out of its way to tell you what you're meant to be doing or how you're meant to do it, and indeed my first hour was spent utterly lost and wandering around the (admittedly very pretty) landscape, accomplishing absolutely nothing. That frustration led me to put it aside for a few months. But if you stick with it, you'll eventually begin to figure out this game's secrets. By the end of my playtime with FRACT I could start it up knowing exactly what I wanted to do, where I wanted to go, and how I was going to do it.\n\nIn FRACT, you're plunged into the trippy, Tron-like world of a gigantic yet dormant synthesizer. As you progress further and further, you'll gradually begin to bring the beast online, unlocking more and more of its features that can ultimately be put to use in an actual sequencer (your studio, as the game calls it) which you can visit at any time. This is a game where completing all the puzzles presents you with an actual reward - a fully functional digital audio workstation that is simple to play with, yet deceptively powerful under the hood.\n\nIf you liked Portal's method of first-person-puzzling, and in particular if you enjoyed the dynamic nature of Portal 2's music which adapted to your progression through the puzzles, you'll likely enjoy this game. It does require a bit of initial time and patience, but it pays off in spades.","October 31, 2014","true","6.8"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

You control your surrounding as you would an audio creation sofwate; only with a few keys and a mouse. No tricky controls or ninja reflexes requiered. The musical enviromenent make you feel like living in a "boards of canada" album.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/itselix/recommended/243220/","itselix","elix ¦ вlϊтz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/itselix/","497 products in account","You're dropped in a barren, alien world with no real idea of what's going on, but as you explore and interact with the strange world around you, you begin to return music and colour to the world and bring it back to life. The soundscape builds around you, taking your own solutions and weaving them into the music of the world.\n\nFRACT is a game that gives you a brief starting tutorial that is completely free of explanatory text. Not only that, the environment is altogether alien and bewildering, and suddenly animated at unpredictable times. Once you've completed the tutorial, the game throws you headfirst into the world without any further hand-holding.\n\nAnd this is what's so fantastic about FRACT: It's full of secrets and amazing places and things for you to discover. But half the fun of unwrapping a gift is the surprise of opening it, and FRACT doesn't try and unwrap the player's gift for them like an excited younger sibling, it lets you pull every strip apart, revealing the glowing, pulsating melody beneath. It lets you piece together an understanding of how the world comes together and what makes it tick. The puzzles themselves are of increasing difficulty, but they shouldn't pose too much of a challenge once you understand how the game and the world works. And that's where the other half of unwrapping the gift comes in: You get the gift itself.\n\nSolving a puzzle in FRACT after you've worked out the underlying system is satisfying, but it's made even more satisfying by the immediate increase in the layers of sound in the soundscape around you, as the tones you've been making the world make suddenly snap into tune and a swell of harmonies follows right behind. Feeling smart and being rewarded with the music becoming more awesome is a very pleasing reward mechanism, and the game continues it throughout. The world itself is surprisingly large, deliberate, and cohesive. There's a story here, waiting to be told in the silent (and musical) ruins. There are little nooks and corners that seem to serve no good purpose except to be a neat little place for you to find. There are side music puzzles that have no bearing on the game progression, and are merely musical toys for you to discover and play with.\n\nNo game is perfect, and FRACT is no different. Some of the puzzles require you to notice and intuit the relationship between things that are not the most obvious even with time and exposure to the puzzle. However, in a game that relies on understanding the subtle environmental clues to solve puzzles, if someone is stuck, it's as likely that in their haste to jump into solving the puzzle they've missed some small but important detail needed to guide themselves towards the solution. A moment's pause and a step back is often the kick that breaks the log jam. Failure in experimentation is inconsequential; at worst, you fall off a platform or have to backtrack slightly, and it's not long before you're right back to where you were, able to progress.\n\nFRACT contains one final gift, even after you've solved the last puzzle, enjoyed the victory spectacle, and seen the credits, and that's the Studio. As you progress through the game, all the way up to the last puzzle, you unlock portions of the very real synthesizers in the player composition facility in a separate, quieter portion of the world. For the impatient, there's the ability to unlock the whole Studio immediately, without needing to finish the game. The synthesizer modulation settings work exactly like they do in-game (not counting the advanced synthesizer options that unlock last), so FRACT in effect teaches the player how to make music.\n\nIt's too early to tell still, but FRACT OSC may be my favourite game of 2014. It's going to take something pretty special to beat the high standard FRACT's set.","April 22, 2014","true","50.8"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","4"

I love Flower on the PS3 and Journey as well (though that's less chillout, more heartrending/warming adventure, though it is beautiful). I also have a fondness for exploration games, hence why I really enjoyed Gone Home and I quite liked Proteus. It's part of why I like ARK Survival Evolved and also why I liked Minecraft too. There was this great exploration element, as you discovered cool little neat things and such.\n\nThe problem I find though is if there's nothing else but exploration, it gets really, really dull, really really fast. Proteus has this problem. It's beautiful and relaxing and charming but there's ♥♥♥♥all to DO whilst you explore. You might as well load up some ambient music and put on a few random visualisations on Winamp or WMP or something. Much the same experience.\n\nHere's where FRACT OSC gets it right though. IT GIVES YOU ♥♥♥♥ TO DO. Oh my god it gives you ♥♥♥♥ to do. It's an exploration game at heart, and a music game. It's both, and its married perfectly together. The world is made up of, controlled by, and explored through music. The music the game creates for you, the music YOU can later create with the synthesiser part of the game. But here's the thing, you can't DO that until you get some instruments. How do you get instruments? you unlock them in game. How? by rebuilding the broken down and out of order sound based tech in these ruins you find yourself in.\n\nHow do you do that? by SOLVING PUZZLES WITH YOUR AWESOME INTERACTO-PUZZLEVISION :D\n\nThere's no enemies, no real threats. You can "die" but that boots you immediately back to the nearest checkpoint you got to. Handy, convenient, and if you don't "die" when you fall off something, chances are you are meant to get there or there's a way back out of it. Fall damage doesn't seem to exist, there doesn't appear to be a way to get irreversably trapped (and if there is you can always press ESC and boot back to last station again, always possible), you can fast travel between stations...\n\nEverything is done through symbols and holographic screens, no words, no voiceover expositing things to you. You gotta work it out yourself, and that's where the game truly shines, not just through the beautiful soundscapes that unlock as you solve puzzles, but because this is at once a fiendish and rewarding first person puzzler, but also a fantastic way to relax and chill out.\n\nI have worked out puzzles and whilst I would be fist pumping and cheering about how I feel like a genius, I'm too chilled the hell out to do so. I merely smile to myself, nod in time to the awesome music, and get started on FINDING the next puzzle, which in itself could be a puzzle!\n\nThis is the perfect exploration/ "walking simulator" -puzzle game combination. You won't regret it. It's challenging, it's difficult, it's often obtuse, it is however both super relaxing, super fun, and super cunning.

You are given a toy that is 100x more complex than a Rubik's Cube™.  With no instructions and no idea what the winning conditions are.

The lack of communication (e.g., score, progress, direction) with the player is terrible.\n\nUnfortunately, while the game scores great originality points with me, there was far too much else that I found lacking or frustrating so I cannot recommend it.

I expected some really obtuse puzzles and I was afraid that after The Fall and Kairo, this will be another game that may be ruined by this aspect. Other than that, 3D Exploration games have really bad reputation recently. Fract OST shows that this genre can have some pretty nice games.\n\nFirstly, the world of Fract OST is very immersive. Ambient atmosphere is really strong in this open-world hub that you are challenged to explore and solve. It was a bit overwhelming at first, but after a bit getting used to, the exploration of this strange world was a pure joy. it's obvious that devs really tried to win you over with this part of the game. You get achievements for discovering some particularly interesting and optional spots in on the map, which feels really rewarding and it's sign of the far greater design choices that constructed this strange world of synthesized music.\n\nPuzzles are not all that great, but they for the most part very straight-forward. They rarely vary in types, but this lets you  focus more on exploration that searching thought Steam Guides which is all great by my book. Those still are good enough for enforcing that feel of reanimating an ancient machinery that was broken for hundreds of years. In conclusion, puzzles are not amazing, but they don't break an immersion by any means.\n\nOverall, Fract OST is a solid proposition for players loving exploration. There isn't any grand backstory, plot or anything like that to discover and yet it was a pleasure to be there in this place. If you don't like Walking Simulators, then I'm not sure if it will change your opinion about the genre, but it's worth a shot. Fract OST, in opposition to other "famous" similar games, have a genuine challenge and you won't be handholded.","March 17, 2015","true","8.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

It's an adventure/puzzle game (sort of like Myst) with great visuals and music. The music is the central element of this game. Each puzzle creates music that builds up as progress is made, creating the soundtrack for that area. There's very little direction or instruction in the game, but it's usually not a problem. The puzzles are satisfying to solve, but aren't too difficult.\n\nThere's also a studio mode that gradually opens up if you want to use the synths and sequencers to make music or mess around. It's fairly limited, but pretty easy to use and songs can be exported (as WAV) or uploaded to youtube.\n\nFRACT OSC is great and I definitely recommend it if you like the graphics & music. It's not a very complex or long (~4 hours, maybe) game, but it's a unique experience that's well worth it.","December 17, 2014","true","18.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I'm stunned at how amazing this game is. I can see that it's not for everyone, but if you are at all musically inclined, enjoy logic puzzles, and don't mind it if a game leaves you to figure things out for yourself rather than telling you where to go and what to do, I cannot recommend this enough. I'm absolutely in love.\n\nGameplay is similar to Kairo: You're dumped in the middle of a strange world full of broken machines, and you have to figure out how to turn them all back on. But with music, and with much nicer visuals. And also, as you solve the puzzles, you unlock tools in your very own sequencer for you to use to make your own music.\n\n+Totally original game concept\n+Simple but beautiful visuals\n+Large "world" to explore\n+Great puzzles - others have said they felt lost and didn't know how to solve the puzzles, but I haven't had any problems; I think that if you're musically and/or logically inclined you shouldn't have any trouble knowing what to do\n+Stellar music - the environment makes its own dynamic music, and you make music; even solving the puzzles is a process of creating music\n+Contains an actual sequencer for making your own music\n\n-Possible to fall off of terrain and get stuck, so you have to start the game over (be careful!)\n-Not suitable for anyone who likes a lot of guidance in a game; easy to get lost/confused, requires patience\n-Probably not a good game for anyone who isn't into music","January 2, 2015","true","7.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

There is no comparison. This game is about synthesizers. You interact with a world at your own pace, and music follows your footsteps.\n\nIf you have any interest in this kind of music (watch the trailer), and have a little bit of understanding of rhythm, you can play this game and enjoy it. I only played about 8 hours before solving the final puzzle, but it was easily one of my favorite games I have played in recent times. This game made me happier than any game I have played all year.\n\nIt is short and minimalistic. There are few instructions, no directions, and no words. You solve puzzles, and get very little from it. But what you do get is everything that you need, perfected. There's a wonderful feeling when the bass suddenly kicks in, because you solved a puzzle, with an added kick of enjoyment from hearing *your* music incorporated into it. Exploration is rewarded by finding little crystals that sing when you get near them, or the faint sound of a puzzle in the distance as you look over a world constructed with little more than basic blocks yet is still beautiful and intriguing.\n\nThe puzzles are impressive. The first puzzles you will encounter for each area are simple, preparing you for future puzzles without obvious tutorials, building to the final puzzles which can be incredibly complicated. Each puzzle is two parts - an approach puzzle, and then an ostensibly musical puzzle - yet despite what many on the internet think, each one can be solved with only logic, no brute forcing needed. There are not nearly enough puzzle games in the world that hit the right balance of solvable and difficult.\n\ntl;dr: You like music? You like puzzles? You like creating instead of destroying?

The world starts cold and grey, not dead but dormant. You explore the geometric caverns & bizarre, daunting structures, figuring out what the world wants you to do, solving its puzzles bit by bit, slowly bringing music and colour and life back into it.\n\nWhen I say music, I MEAN music. While each puzzle has a logical solution (with some creative wiggle room), that solution also turns out to be a musical phrase, coarsing through the pulsing neon around you.\n\nAnd the puzzles themselves all come together. First in sections, as you complete each of the three themed sections, and then finally in one huge, elaborate chamber, you compose your own conclusion. Unique to your play and your aesthetic, but also carefully curated by the games puzzles to be coherent and beautiful. The world it turns out, is nothing less than an enormous, powerful synthesizer.\n\nTo say this game is orginal and unusual would be an understatement: I've never known a game do anything even remotely like this, before or since.\nThis game is also very well-designed, carefully walking the line between guiding you to an understanding as the puzzles increase in complexity, and leaving you to explore and figure things out on your own.\n\nBut more than anything else, this game is utterly, sublimely beautiful. The aesthetic is simple - textureless polygons and bold neon primaries are pretty much the only graphics - but the way it gently coaxes you towards creating something beautiful and unique, until the world around you erupts into an ecstatic epiphany, an explosion of life and light and music...\n\nI will never forget this game, as long as I live.","March 20","true","11.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It’s hard to articulate how FRACT can make you feel. It’s most certainly an unconventional experience and arguably a one-of-a-kind art form so I’ll try to spoil as little as I can.\n\nFRACT OSC is reminiscent of atmospheric adventure games like Myst. After a very brief introduction to the simple controls, you find yourself immersed in a dark and hauntingly silent underground world. You are given no clue as to where you are or what you’re supposed to do. This may sound overwhelming at first but once you take the first steps you realize there’s a fairly guided and intuitive way of navigating this world.\n\nThe Tron-esque and awe-inspiring open-world of FRACT is filled with massive structures, glowing towers and dormant devices you attempt to restore. But despite its mechanical and desolate appearance, the world feels oddly organic. As you approach its objects they react to your presence by expanding themselves and/or giving off delicate melodies.\n\nThe exquisite post-processing filters and radiant geometric structures produce a vivid yet dark ambiance. I found the landscape and architecture so jaw-dropping I couldn’t help but taking dozens of screenshots throughout my play-through.\n\nThe puzzles are especially appealing because as you interact with them you shape the soundscape around you, the puzzle structures emit different tunes which ultimately burst into a full-blown symphony and explosion of light upon completion. This incredibly cool way of rewarding players makes solving puzzles feel more like a creative process rather than a hassle.\n\nPhosfiend’s work is so remarkable because they managed to create an incredibly rich and immersive experience in a completely unique setting without using a single word or any sort of narrative. It’s just fantastic to see everything gradually come together and rise to a beautiful climax.\n\nOn a side note, I recommend using a controller for a more cinematic experience that can only be achieved with subtle movements of the analog sticks; You can still use the mouse for faster puzzle solving.","July 8, 2014","true","8.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The music and visuals are really atmospheric but aren't really necessary for the puzzles; This is not a music-puzzle game.\n\nYou start out in a virtual synth studio where you can lay down tracks using the basic instruments: Synth lead, bass and pad. Most of the controls are locked at first, and there's a door leading to what appears to be the tron-like insides of the synth. As you delve deeper into the synth world and solve puzzles, more and more controls unlock. This is a clever way of avoiding the paralysis of being in front of a full-advanced-synth control panel.\n\nThe music and visual are amazing if you don't hate synth music and abstract neon visuals. I loved it. The puzzles are simple and get progressively harder. Nothing is really explained and you're left to discover and experiment and explore.\n\nThis is also actual synth software, meaning you can (irreversibly) skip the puzzle-solving-and-unlocking and just unlock everything from the get-go. You'd be missing out though. The game's originality and atmosphere comes from being inside the synthesizer.\n\nThis is a really unique game that is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nHighly recommended if you're into synth music.","May 4, 2014","true","6.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

If you were a big fan of the MYST series, like I was, then this is perfect for you.\n\nThere is no real story behind this game, and it invites you to use your imagination, to explain why everything is what it is. From the visual and aural feasts you are given, you draw your own conclusions as to what the civilization was like. There is virtually no text within the actual game, instead relying on pictures and diagrams to relay information. Music is heavily used for artistic effect, though many of the puzzles  do not require music to solve. Instead, having an iPod or Phone handy to take quick pictures of diagrams is useful. This game requires an awful lot of backtracking, so be prepared.\n\nBeware, to run this at a constant framerate you need a decent rig, or to turn down the view distance. However, your mileage may vary. The options menu is rather sparse, lacking even a rebind keys option, which forces you to use the default bindings.\n\nThis game uses flat textures and polygonal shapes to create the terrain and buildings, and personally, I think it pulls off the look quite well. For such a simple design, it is quite beautiful.\nThe music creation tool is not something I have experimented with, but if you have any experience with music editing programs, you may find use in some of its synths. Again, your mileage may vary.\n\nIn my opinion, this game does not neccesarily warrant more than one playthrough, but if you have the patience to finish the game, you should have the patience to find and collect the achievements. I'm going to be searching for them myself, as I haven't perfected the game yet.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is beautiful. The art style is wonderful, but the puzzles are not for the impatient. Many of them require fine tuning and experimentation, and some of the later ones require backtracking. The options menu could do with more, but it is forgivable by a game so pretty.","November 23, 2014","true","6.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That isn't to say this game isn't challenging, as some of the puzzles, especially the later ones, will likely have you scratching your head and pushing you closer and closer to the temptation of steam guides. Rather, the puzzles of the game are overshadowed by the overall atmosphere. This is a game that really does deserve to be played with the lights down, the volume up and no distractions. The world and the art style is simply beautiful which, coupled with the superb analog-sounding synths provides both a relaxing and an empowering experience. Each puzzle solved reastores areas of the world back to life, turning a cold, lifeless wasteland into a thing of beauty.\n\nHow much you enjoy FRACT OSC will depend on how much you enjoy synthesizers. If you're the kind of person who can tell your VCO from your VCA, use an envelope for things besides posting letters and consider a delay to be a desirable thing, the puzzles will only be part of the attraction. FRACT also provides a feature-rich studio that produces some amazingly warm sounds which will keep you busy for some time. And if you're not a synthesizer fan? Well, perhaps the easy to use interface (which can be toggled between basic, abstract controls to something that wouldn't look out of place in the Death Star's control room) will convince you otherwise.\n\nAll in all, it's a great game with a beautiful art style, brilliant sound and a fantastic atmosphere.

To be honest, I thought the puzzles were a bit too easy. I never really got stuck; the most stuck I got was trying to find the next station or something. Despite the puzzles not being challenging, they were still extremely satisfying to solve, because the music gradually builds up as you're solving it, and once the final piece clicks into place, it all comes together and sounds amazing.\n\nThe visual style was very cool. The materials were bland, but the glowing lights made up for that.\n\nAnd of course the sound design was excellent. My only complaint would be not giving the player more freedom with the music on game, but that would probably ruin the atmosphere if the player doesn't know music.

It also seems to have a sequel that nobody talks about on pain of death.\n\nThe world of FRACT OSC is a blocky pseudo-natural landscape littered with abstract buildings and machines all presented from the first person perspective in a TRON-esque style. The hills are alive with the sound of music (thank you, Julie Andrews), literally, much of it moves and reacts to your presence, initially producing simple synthy tones and dull lit paths, often they build into tunes upon paths of neon, and in progress layer into crescendos and brilliant firework displays of light.\n\nIts hard to explain without a video. But, I feel that this is something you should experience for yourself.\n\nStory\n\nThere is no story.\n\nYou're just unceremoniously dropped into FRACT OSC's world with no narrative whatsoever. This is one of those games where you could assume that there is a narrative behind the world, and you're there to discover/progress it. But you don't have to. It needs no reason to exist beyond having fun. There are no enemies, or characters. You are the only presence here, and your actions alone affect the world, but I can't really explain that without going into the...\n\nMechanics\n\nSo, without a narrative, or antagonist, what do you do? Explore. Solve puzzles. Make music.\n\nThe world doesn't always give you a clear idea on where to go, or what to do, but that makes it more interesting. You can often inadvertently start on a puzzle that is a few ahead of the intended order, but it doesn't matter.\n\nThe eventual goal is to bring life (represented by light and music) back each of three large areas. They're based on different layers of synth music (Bass, Pad and Lead), each with their own signature flavour and architecture. The Lead area is strawberry pink with large buildings acting as gateways to vertigo-inducing platforms, uneven crystalline formations litter the land. In Bass you direct luminescent beams of energy between industrial columns, toxic pools drown its central citadel. The world oozes detail and you have free reign over its geography. You can fall to your doom, but the penalty is reappearing at the last checkpoint with no progress loss. The puzzles are varied within and between areas, none of them outlive their welcome, they can be a little tricky, but again, you play with them, figure 'em out, and move on forward.\n\nOnce you have completely reinvigorated the three primary areas, you ascend into a final area wherein you gain and exact control over the structure itself. Everything culminates together in one big arresting performance that you yourself created in just playing the game.\n\nAnd then?\n\nThen you are left with a synth music creation tool, free to toy with to produce surprisingly varied and complex compositions with relative ease. Granted this part does not hold my interest. FRACT OSC is a game I can love and leave feeling satisfied.\n\nRound up\n\nI'm gonna avoid doing the whole what is good/bad/ugly about this game blurb. I don't think it is necessary here.\n\nFRACT OSC is unique. It's short (about 6 hours) and beautiful. A feast for the eyes and ears alike, fun to explore and a competent cognitive challenge.

They make up for it with a whole lot of original synth music. So, Myst - art - story + synth = Fract OSC. If you're looking for a story, forget it, this is all puzzle, all the time. The reward is listening to synth music that you sort of created yourself as a side effect of solving the puzzles.\n\nThe puzzles are mostly well tuned, but there are one or two that will force you to go ask around for the solution or look it up. Most of it can be played without resorting to a walkthrough. In this day of youtube and internet, you can't make things too hard or the game becomes simply one big walkthrough lookup. They seemed to have gotten that message.\n\nAt the end you get a basic synth composer which you can futz with if so inclined.\n","April 23, 2014","true","21.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some of them are so cleverly made that I was more that surprised, but I won't spoil it for anybody. Let's just say that solving puzzles never felt this rewarding before.\n\nAs a musician, this has become one of my favourite games. The fact that all of the sounds are live rendered in the game (it is a bit heavy on your computer, and unless you have a good CPU, it might crackle a bit), makes it so much better. I won't even begin about the inclusion of a usable studio for music production. It might not be as powerful as some DAWs, but it is insanely fun to play around with the same synths you already had to use to solve all the puzzles.\n\nMore than recommended, especially if you love electronic music and adventure games.","April 26, 2014","true","10.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I will say that while playing this game, you will spend a considerable amount of time scratching your head. It will often fool you into thinking you've solved the puzzle before you realize you're trapped and you have to disassemble the entire thing to escape or move on to the next level. This is good though, because it forces you to rethink everything so that you can separate yourself from the obstacles and move on to the next task.\n\nIf you're a "first-person adventure" fan, the first thing that you will find troubling is the fact that you cannot jump. I don't know why they didn't add the feature, but in a world with various shapes and horizontal planes sitting at different levels, you'll find yourself wanting to skip walking around everything and hit spacebar to jump -- only to find it isn't working. I'm kinda hoping they'll include it in a later patch. ;)\n\nThere's also various (already obvious) bugs that will probably be fixed later on. You will notice yourself falling through platforms, sometimes at random.

I will say that while playing this game, you will spend a considerable amount of time scratching your head. It will often fool you into thinking you've solved the puzzle before you realize you're trapped and you have to disassemble the entire thing to escape or move on to the next level. This is good though, because it forces you to rethink everything so that you can separate yourself from the obstacles and move on to the next task.\n\nIf you're a "first-person adventure" fan, the first thing that you will find troubling is the fact that you cannot jump. I don't know why they didn't add the feature, but in a world with various shapes and horizontal planes sitting at different levels, you'll find yourself wanting to skip walking around everything and hit spacebar to jump -- only to find it isn't working. I'm kinda hoping they'll include it in a later patch. ;)\n\nThere's also various (already obvious) bugs that will probably be fixed later on. You will notice yourself falling through platforms, sometimes at random. Luckily you'll respawn back at the puzzle you were last at or pathway you were last exploring, but I think it has something to do with the mis-interaction with different solid planes. You can also accidentally stumble upon further levels while exploring, but you can't interact with them until you advance far enough with the ones before it.\n\nAll in all, it's a stunning addition to the adventure game collection and I can't wait to get further into it, perhaps playing around the the music studio feature more.","April 22, 2014","true","8.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

FRACT is a first person puzzle game with music roots and complex puzzles. It's an often, harsh mistress that teaches you almost nothing (beyond the standard controls).\n\nAs you progress through 1 of 3 different puzzle trees, you unlock music creation tools for your hub world that allow you to chill out away from the puzzles and create a tune that is characteristically you.\n\nThe game, while a fantastic voyage via puzzles does a great job of explaining nothing, it also hits you with so much colour that the next step that you could or should be going isn't always clear. While this is clearly to allow you the freedom to explore wherever you want to go, it is at times more overwhelming instead of the freedom of exploration. As you're limited to very few actions that you can perform beyond simple movement.\n\nIt's well worth a look in for people that are interested in a colourful, egaging and challenging journey that is incredibly distinctive from the gritty palettes of war and death that we've come to expect from most games. I know I'll be playing more of this title, to better understand and uncover more of what FRACT has to offer.","April 23, 2014","true","2.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Pay attention: I didn't play the game long because it got me bored and frustrated very quickly (and I am a classical musician with perfect pitch, I was intrigued by this game).\n\nWorld built on sound: it is not built on sound. You hear sounds, exclusively electronic/synthetic. How the world is built on sound I don't know. No, it is not as interesting as it "sounds".\n\nSolving puzzles: that's not solving, that's messing around with something until it triggers something else. In no way the game tells you what to do (I don't say it should), and the puzzles have no way of getting your interest. Also the interaction system is quite confusing and you have to constantly stand in the right spot or you won't see the things you can interact with (rapid transport is an example).\n\nAbstract landscape: it does not look as nice as in the screenshots. The colors are not as vivid, the lighting is not as good, everything looks quite plain. Plus, your character (even while sprinting) is so slow that getting from one place to the other (even though there are rapid transports) is a pain.\n\nI will give it a second chance I hope, but really, don't make my same mistake, know more about the game, I was just intrigued by the description and the screenshots, I should have known better.","February 24","false","0.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Count me in.\nAnd, yeah, for the first two hours, I was amazed.\nBut it quickly came apparant to me that this game is lacking lots of substance. Each level in each area is the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzle with slight variation. And there are only 3 areas in the entire game! One of the core puzzles the game is a pipe puzzle where you turn pipes to direct the flow of lasers! I mean what kind of bland, unoriginal idea for a puzzle is that?\nThe gameplay basically boils down to this:\n-enter new area\n-solve puzzle\n-compose song to open doors/power lasers\n-rinse and repeat until all completely identical puzzles are complete\n-go back to first part of the area\n-realise you have to go back to each and every puzzle to find a combination code for the final puzzle\n-get out some ♥♥♥♥ing paper\n-fly back to all the previous puzzles and write down the code\n-go back to the first part again\n-input the code\nYeey area done.

The puzzles felt fun and original and it neither felt like I was reusing old solutions nor was the main core mechanic of each set being under-used (i.e. being introduced then taken away for another mechanic).\n\nThe exploration is really nicely done, it felt like Dark Souls level of "do it yourself, we're not giving you a map or anything", and while it was confusing at first until you realise how pathing works, it made me feel a lot more free and immersed within the game.\n\nThe artstyle is something I was a big fan of, very Tron like yet it wasn't sickening with neon. The colours stood out and made key areas and visuals clear, as the rest of the game is rather dark in shading.\n\nThe music was absolutely beautiful and probably the game's highlight. Every little part of the game, from the puzzles (which I noticed changed either modulations or notes on the main synthesizer) to the little expanding platforms changes the music in some way and makes the world feel magical and mysterious. The atmosphere it creates is one that enchanted me from the beginning to the end.\n\nThe little unlockables at the end that unlock parts of the synth to use are probably one of the most desirable unlockables I've ever come across in any game. Unlike Crackdown's orbs or Meat Boy's bandages (both games I enjoyed but did not feel invested in the collectables, even though they changed the game in some way), this game goes for short but sweet collectables that add modulations and functions to the additional synthesizer which can be used to make pretty tracks without needing too much experience in music design itself. In fact, the game sort of teaches you about certain aspects of music design and effect through its puzzles, like one for instance which works on timing decay.\n\nIf I had to say there was something lacking, it would be the loss of (at least I don't think there is) a story or underlying message. This could however just be me unable to observe or notice it, though. Also, there isn't much replayability outside of the synth, but the synth does kind of make up for that by itself.\n\nAll in all I had a great time playing this game and I continue to play around with the synth. I would absolutely recommend buying this game if you can, it's well worth your time and money.","January 5, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

How much you will enjoy it depends on how well your personal axis' lines up with these two realities (so, results may vary).\n\nI am, personally, a bit of an electronic musician.  Rebirth, Cubase, Korgs, an 808 and Ableton Live are things I like to just pull out to play with.  The fact that some insane geniuses took elements from all of these (and much much more) and turned them into a puzzle game is, frankly, just too amazing for my fragile phsyche to fully explain in a way that doesn't involve my labido exploding into neon flavored goo.

The player lands on an alien world, populated only by a flora of luminescent polygons and strange contraptions. Tron comes to mind when thinking about what this whole world looks like, but there isn't a lot of well-known examples that rely heavily on neon lighting and simple geometric shapes. The trailer gives a good idea of what the game looks like.\n\nSimilar to Myst's level design, each contraption is located on a seperate section of the map (islands, in Myst's case). So in a sense, it's non-linear. The player gets to choose where he heads out first, and the order in which the contraptions are tackled don't really affect how the game turns out.\n\nWhat's interesting about this game is that solving the puzzles creates music "tracks". One of the machines spits out a drum loop, another one some chords, and due to the nature of the puzzles, there are usually a few possible solutions for each one. At the end, you get to play around with your creation, remix it, put in some effects... it's actually a lot fun !\n\nThere's even a surprisingly apt step-sequencer located at the map's main hub (your spawning spot, basically). Each puzzle solved unlocks a module in the step-sequencer (bass-line, lead synths, pad sounds, etc.), so one you've finished the game, you can give it a go and try to create your very own electronic jingle. Don't get me wrong, it's not a professional studio tool, but it's still a very nice way to finish off the game.\n\nPros\nVery cool visuals\nA nice twist on the Myst-genre (if there is such a thing)\nNice soundtrack\nCool synthesizer and step-sequencer at the end that rewards you for your hard work playing the game :P\n\nCons\nPuzzles are a little too simple, would have liked a larger arc that spans accross the entire map\nPlaythrough is a little short","September 24, 2014","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wanted to venture out from my hotel and explore the city of Erbil. But instead I mostly stuck close to our Peshmerga guards and my friends in our medical service team as we shuttled from location to location. Still, our group braved the communication divide a few times, usually in marketplace situations where Iraqui Dinar could do all the talking. The question lingered in the back of my mind each time we stepped out, “How well are we going to be able to read our environment?” Some navigational anxiety was sated by the fact that I still had familiar objects to read and relate to – things like trees, buildings, cars, and friends. Our group stuck together in this setting, leaning on one another to make sense of our alien surroundings.\n\nIn FRACT OSC, I had no language, objects, or friends to relate to. It was just me, exploring an alien world made of abstract shapes and synthesizers.\n\nI needed my music-literate buddy, Max, to help make sense of the world.\n\nFRACT OSC invites me into extreme illiteracy. It’s like landing in a country I’m even less prepared for than Kurdish Iraq. My FRACT illiteracy reminds me of my own privileges. And just how hard it must for people to understand the world with limited access to friends and family. FRACT OSC got rather unpleasant at times, but I also think it’s brilliant. It drew discomfort out of my own inability to read the world. It drew me into reliance on somebody other than myself. And reminded me that understanding often comes from community.\n\nFor the record, I haven’t completed the game. But you can be sure I’m saving it for the next time Max comes over.\n\nRead more: http://gamechurch.com/feeling-foreign-in-fract-osc/","September 24, 2014","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's like the world from Reboot except 15 times more mysterious, massive, and dark. and a lot like Myst except the puzzles are even more enjoyable, awarding, and unique. But my favorite part of the game is that the massive world around you changes as you fix and connect all sorts of titanic machinery. It's awesome to see turbines, generators and beams of energy moving, flowint, working, and connecting together as you repair this sleeping dimension. (and nothing in the game is behind the safety of invisible walls where the player may only assume that other things are out there. Every single thing that exists in the dimension from start to finish, for anyone who loves to explore). And I find that the minimalistic graphics help improve the immersion of trying to figure out what this world is and why you are in it. "Am I standing on oddly shapped soil or 100% pure crystal? Are these temples or factories you're exploring, or titanic hand held tools built by alien gods??? If you have an imagination, you would love every second this game reveals to you. (and lots of exploration and secret areas. LOOOOTS of exploration and secret areas). my only regret is that I want a FRACT 2, which I'm almost positive will never happen :'(\n","October 10, 2014","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rebirth, Cubase, Korgs, an 808 and Ableton Live are things I like to just pull out to play with.

This auditory odyssy offers an Alice in Wonderland ride that, while it delights the senses, ultimately makes little sense from a traditional storytelling perspective. The only explanation the player receives about the story is before you ever buy the game or install. After that, the player is subjected to a variety of sights and sounds in what seems like an immense world, but how all of these pieces tie together leaves a player more puzzled than satisfied. But, if the player can suspend disbelief and the need for a strong narrative, the game does impress the senses.\n\nOffering a midi style toolbox (i.e., 'the studio') with which to build tracks, Fract pays homage to the demo scene of the 80s and 90s. Tools within the studio can be unlocked organically by making progress in the single player game, or a player can opt to bypass the story and unlock all components of the studio immediately.\n\nMy only complaint is a compliment to the game-- I enjoyed it so much, I wish there was more to the single player story. (I only got 8 hours out of the game, using no walkthroughs.)\n\nI highly recommend Fract if the game is on sale. I still recommend the game at its "normal" price point, although that recommendation is not as strong at full price due solely to the limited story content.\n\nEither way-- Fract is a game that won't soon be forgotten.","November 29, 2014","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like the abstract nature and lack of handholding, and I especially recommend this game to my programming cohort ;).\n\nI grabbed this game in a bundle- and this game single-handedly influenced my decision to go ahead and get the bundle. This game is at first glance, sheer EYE-CANDY! Although, as I will go on to explain, it is much more than that. As a person who loves point-and-click games- this game is a 3D adventure/exploration with puzzles and P&C without the inventory.\n\nI want to quote the developer here, "Fract is not just about exploring a world or solving its puzzles, but it's about taking a journey of musical discovery". I feel this statement is so true. As a self-proclaimed music and puzzle aficionado, I thought the combination of lights and sound was an excellent foundation, and the abstract nature of this game did not slow me down at all. Some people may feel the game begs the question "what do I do?” to which I pose the answer- try stuff. The game has a good feedback loop- you will realize the game is not linear and it is not a sandbox. The game will respond to "correct actions" by lighting stuff up, which should naturally incline you to try more of that stuff. The finale of the game culminates into a musical puzzle symphony experience.\n\nThe game has some replay value- (in fact, I’m feeling the urge to go and replay after posting this review-  keep in mind it’s been a few months since I played last). You can also go into your “studio” and make your own beats and loops- even though that’s not my “thing” that’s still a pretty cool feature . All in all a great game, and I recommend you give it a try.\n","October 28, 2015","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

None of them have felt appropriate enough; the best I can say for them is that they were not wrong, just not right enough.\nBut, that's both the trick and the beauty behind FRACT OSC! In order to discuss it, you have to explain how you've interacted with a series of interconnected, interrelated musical art installations in a virtual space ─ fairly abstract installations, at that.\n\nGetting blunt about it, the game/experience essentially is teaching you fundamentals [and a few finer points] of step sequenced electronic music. Imagine if the makers of the Roland MC 505 built an ancient city driven by this kind of sequential input to make stuff work.\n\nFor me, there is a truly soothing quality to the game.

I've played many of these abstract, atmospheric games on Steam, and this one is really channeling something from the creators on a level far above the rest. I really don't even want to describe it too much.\n\nSo what to say. I will describe a single moment in my experience of the game:\n\nI had been roaming around, fiddling with things, and appreciating the environments for a while. I wondered off of a lit path into a long, low cave out of curiosity. I followed it for a while. As it began to open up, a soft warm glow came out of the shadows with the low wisps of a distant tune. I walked farther, approaching a strange object protruding from the cave floor and reaching nearly to the ceiling. This object was the source of the soft pink glow and the tune, now filling the air, mesmerizing and somber. It was so beautiful. I sat for nearly half an hour staring at the object and feeling the slow pace of its low melody.\n\nAs I tried to finally leave, I found it difficult somehow. I knew the melody would fade, and this, strangely, made me sad. I tried again and the same feeling came to me. As it took me I realized the loneliness and sadness inherent in this object and in this place. That this beautiful setting and this melancholy tune would only exist together here, as they are, deep in this cave, inside this fractured world, only seen or heard by those few who venture here, guided by nothing.\n\nI could only think one thing ... "thank you".","May 17, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The devs told people who experienced it to go into the options menu in-game and uncheck a box, and that got rid of about 70% of crackling for me, but 30% is still a lot for a sound based game.\n\nThe devs told us that people with low end sound cards would experience the crackling, but even some people with high end setups also said they had audio problems. I would guess about 20% of players reported this audio issue.\n\nTo my knowledge, the devs still haven't been able to pinpoint a commonality for why so many users across the spectrum have had crackles. and as a result, no patch has ever been released.\n\nBut the game is very pleasing to the ear(when there's no crackling, of course), and it's puzzles are challenging. As you solve puzzles, you unlock elements of a synthesizer. Once you unlock everything, you can use it to make your own music in the game.\n\nIf you get the game, I would buy the game on a sale and just hope that you're not one of the unlucky ones who experience the audio crackles.","June 27, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No violence, no worries - totally family friendly. Lots of needing to figure things out on your own and interpreting abstract events as they come.\n\nGameplay: The game has a very unique and well executed blend of music, puzzles, and exploration. This is not found in any other game I have played. The environment oozes with music and custom tones that are affected by what you do to the environment. The game is not super easy, which is very good, because I like a challenge. The only thing I would have liked to see more is a bit more variance in the puzzle mechanics - many of them are represented as synth / equalizer adjustments to get the right combination. But overall, the game did still boast a good variety of puzzles.\n\nVisuals and Audio: Superb. Game is beautiful in both regards. ESPECIALLY audio (of course!). There are loads of environments and the music and abstract visuals actually blend together in harmony - very nice!\n\nNote: my review doesn't even consider the aspects of the custom synthesizer aspect of the game in which you can compose your own works of music.

Check the forums to see if you may be affected before throwing down your cash)\n\nFor me there's something entirely irresistible about the idea of playing a game that is ready to hand me the keys to a labyrinthine world slathered in elegant, minimalistic eye-candy, bolstered by a soundtrack that... well... is entirely unique.\n\nBy messing around with the puzzles you invariably encounter through exploration around the world of FRACT OSC, you quickly pick up on the musical theme of the game, and - more importantly - an idea of how to progress.\n\nThe puzzles smoothly ramp up in challenge, testing your ability to match the interface controls, with the visual stimulus in order to create the 'right music' to proceed. It's an ingeniously engaging concept that has immediate and tangible rewards.\n\nThings only get better as you layer your puzzled-masterpiece and bring the 'world' back to life, revealing all-new challenges.\n\nAfter all is said and done, you're left with a very functional, and extremely beautiful synthesiser. Compositions can be saved and nothing feels better than stepping back and watching the game's world flash and spin and shift with your music.\n\nHowever, there's no free-dinner with this game - you'll have to pay for the multi-functionality (as well as the very dynamic audio-scape) with an intense and significantly high CPU requirement. Despite the minimalistic visuals, it's easy to find yourself in areas that place a strain on the game, bringing the smooth framerate to a choppy crawl. Thankfully the puzzles are not dependant on a high framerate (at least, not as much as your average game), making the poor performance more of a disappointing shame than a frustrating game-breaking (and game-quitting) problem.\n\nFor those with more than a twinge of an interest in exploration, puzzling and musical creativity, this game couldn't be better focused to your needs. Grab a solid set of headphones, or crank up the sound system and bathe in the joy that is FRACT OSC.","April 26, 2014","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Puzzle doesn't really cover it, and neither does adventure. Exploration is a very important aspect of the game, and I guess that's the brunt of its charm.\n\nThe game starts you off in a curious environment, something akin to a studio, where the player has to find his or her own way around. A quick, wordless tutorial is all you get to help you get acquainted with how the game functions, before you are taken into the main area of the game.\n\nIts expansiveness is mesmerising. A beautifully sculpted world will leave you wide-eyed as you stumble around until things make sense. The confusion can be disheartening at first. There's no explanation in words, no exposition. It can take a while before things start to click. But once they do, you'll feel very much in control. You feel like you have a purpose, like you know what you are doing and there's a healthy feeling of accomplishment that comes with it.\n\nIt's a shame that the game isn't too long. But it's something I'd want to do again, and probably even more than twice. The game speaks to the player not in words, but in music. And that means it plays on your emotions. Mind you, it doesn't bring you rage or sadness, but instead it knows how to make you feel euphoric after completing a section.\n\nThe end reward is something fun as well. After you've completed the exploration and puzzle sequences, you're left with a fully functional studio that allows you to mix and create your own songs. You can even use some of the puzzle solutions you've learned before in your songs if you so wish.\n\nOverall, I guess it comes down to that wordless connection it builds with the player. It doesn't feel harsh or unforgiving at all, but the world, while desolate, seems to be reaching out to the player somewhat. It tunes in and draws you in far more strongly than most games would, and that's a big chunk of its charm.\n\nI can recommend this to virtually anyone. People who do not like puzzles might want to steer clear, but for those who do: FRACT OSC is a must-have.","April 26, 2014","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I will describe a single moment in my experience of the game:\n\nI had been roaming around, fiddling with things, and appreciating the environments for a while. I wondered off of a lit path into a long, low cave out of curiosity. I followed it for a while. As it began to open up, a soft warm glow came out of the shadows with the low wisps of a distant tune. I walked farther, approaching a strange object protruding from the cave floor and reaching nearly to the ceiling. This object was the source of the soft pink glow and the tune, now filling the air, mesmerizing and somber. It was so beautiful. I sat for nearly half an hour staring at the object and feeling the slow pace of its low melody.\n\nAs I tried to finally leave, I found it difficult somehow. I knew the melody would fade, and this, strangely, made me sad. I tried again and the same feeling came to me. As it took me I realized the loneliness and sadness inherent in this object and in this place. That this beautiful setting and this melancholy tune would only exist together here, as they are, deep in this cave, inside this fractured world, only seen or heard by those few who venture here, guided by nothing.\n\nI could only think one thing ... "thank you".","May 17, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles felt fun and original and it neither felt like I was reusing old solutions nor was the main core mechanic of each set being under-used (i.e. being introduced then taken away for another mechanic).\n\nThe exploration is really nicely done, it felt like Dark Souls level of "do it yourself, we're not giving you a map or anything", and while it was confusing at first until you realise how pathing works, it made me feel a lot more free and immersed within the game.\n\nThe artstyle is something I was a big fan of, very Tron like yet it wasn't sickening with neon. The colours stood out and made key areas and visuals clear, as the rest of the game is rather dark in shading.\n\nThe music was absolutely beautiful and probably the game's highlight. Every little part of the game, from the puzzles (which I noticed changed either modulations or notes on the main synthesizer) to the little expanding platforms changes the music in some way and makes the world feel magical and mysterious. The atmosphere it creates is one that enchanted me from the beginning to the end.\n\nThe little unlockables at the end that unlock parts of the synth to use are probably one of the most desirable unlockables I've ever come across in any game. Unlike Crackdown's orbs or Meat Boy's bandages (both games I enjoyed but did not feel invested in the collectables, even though they changed the game in some way), this game goes for short but sweet collectables that add modulations and functions to the additional synthesizer which can be used to make pretty tracks without needing too much experience in music design itself. In fact, the game sort of teaches you about certain aspects of music design and effect through its puzzles, like one for instance which works on timing decay.\n\nIf I had to say there was something lacking, it would be the loss of (at least I don't think there is) a story or underlying message. This could however just be me unable to observe or notice it, though. Also, there isn't much replayability outside of the synth, but the synth does kind of make up for that by itself.\n\nAll in all I had a great time playing this game and I continue to play around with the synth. I would absolutely recommend buying this game if you can, it's well worth your time and money.","January 5, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I felt like I was exploring the inside of Altair IV from the 1956 film The Forbidden Planet.\n\nThere are a few impressive things about this game, firstly the whole game (except for the main menu) it one giant open world puzzle game with an intricate transport system very much like the rail system in Riven (1997). You can explore off the beaten path and all you will find is beautiful level design all around you. The puzzles are abstract, but all are built on the same musical foundation so I did look at a few hints with my first chosen area, but after that I didn't need to look at any as all the puzzles are solidly designed and don't rely on any silly tricks to solve.\nThis is still (9 months after the release) version 1.0 of the game, it has been toughly tested.

It's like the world from Reboot except 15 times more mysterious, massive, and dark. and a lot like Myst except the puzzles are even more enjoyable, awarding, and unique. But my favorite part of the game is that the massive world around you changes as you fix and connect all sorts of titanic machinery. It's awesome to see turbines, generators and beams of energy moving, flowint, working, and connecting together as you repair this sleeping dimension. (and nothing in the game is behind the safety of invisible walls where the player may only assume that other things are out there. Every single thing that exists in the dimension from start to finish, for anyone who loves to explore). And I find that the minimalistic graphics help improve the immersion of trying to figure out what this world is and why you are in it. "Am I standing on oddly shapped soil or 100% pure crystal? Are these temples or factories you're exploring, or titanic hand held tools built by alien gods??? If you have an imagination, you would love every second this game reveals to you.

But I also can't recommend it to you, because it's just so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying sometimes.\n\nGood:\n- The most beautiful fast travel system of any game I've ever played\n- Cool premise, sleek design\nBad:\n- Two puzzles which gave me the "solved" sound cue and visual after I made one move at random, and then required me to finish the rest of the puzzle in order to progress. Discouraging.\n- The 'platform rotate' control is a pain to operate with a mouse.\n- In the middle of one puzzle, dropping me through a solid platform above a deep pit. Twice. Which brings me to my next point:\n- Backtracking. The default walk speed is too slow, and running requires you to constanly hold shift. Also, there's no jumping. Which is annoying when you assume you can jump, and walk straight into a pit that doesn't kill you, but does require you to restart from some randomly chosen place a minute's walk from the puzzle you were working on.\n- For a game that's mostly about sound, the sounds are kinda annoying.\n\nIf, like me, you enjoy games like Myst, with the first person puzzles, no characters or combat, and a contemplative (read: glacial) pace, you'll probably get some enjoyment from this game. If you're just here for the cool synths, go buy Garage Band or something.","September 26, 2015","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like the abstract nature and lack of handholding, and I especially recommend this game to my programming cohort ;).\n\nI grabbed this game in a bundle- and this game single-handedly influenced my decision to go ahead and get the bundle. This game is at first glance, sheer EYE-CANDY! Although, as I will go on to explain, it is much more than that. As a person who loves point-and-click games- this game is a 3D adventure/exploration with puzzles and P&C without the inventory.\n\nI want to quote the developer here, "Fract is not just about exploring a world or solving its puzzles, but it's about taking a journey of musical discovery". I feel this statement is so true. As a self-proclaimed music and puzzle aficionado, I thought the combination of lights and sound was an excellent foundation, and the abstract nature of this game did not slow me down at all. Some people may feel the game begs the question "what do I do?” to which I pose the answer- try stuff. The game has a good feedback loop- you will realize the game is not linear and it is not a sandbox. The game will respond to "correct actions" by lighting stuff up, which should naturally incline you to try more of that stuff. The finale of the game culminates into a musical puzzle symphony experience.\n\nThe game has some replay value- (in fact, I’m feeling the urge to go and replay after posting this review-  keep in mind it’s been a few months since I played last). You can also go into your “studio” and make your own beats and loops- even though that’s not my “thing” that’s still a pretty cool feature . All in all a great game, and I recommend you give it a try.\n","October 28, 2015","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It doesn't really tell you much of anything at all which is likely a major detractor for many, but you're basically repairing destroyed instruments through puzzles and things. Because the game doesn't explain how to do anything, it can be a pain just to figure out what's going on, but once you do and the instrument starts working there's this awesome feeling of success.

Technically, all the different influences it puts on you as the player are sublte. But, there are so many of them. And, once you adapt to the situation, it's very appealing. There really is a bliss factor to the game.\n\nHOW TO BEST DESCRIBE THE GAME EXPERIENCE...I've tried several descriptions in this review before. None of them have felt appropriate enough; the best I can say for them is that they were not wrong, just not right enough.\nBut, that's both the trick and the beauty behind FRACT OSC! In order to discuss it, you have to explain how you've interacted with a series of interconnected, interrelated musical art installations in a virtual space ─ fairly abstract installations, at that.\n\nGetting blunt about it, the game/experience essentially is teaching you fundamentals [and a few finer points] of step sequenced electronic music. Imagine if the makers of the Roland MC 505 built an ancient city driven by this kind of sequential input to make stuff work.\n\nFor me, there is a truly soothing quality to the game. It's also one of the very few puzzle games I'm willing to play.\nIf you enjoy things like ambient electronica, I can't recommend this game enough.","July 10, 2014","true","34.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
