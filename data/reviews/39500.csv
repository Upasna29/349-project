I sniped 4 of the 5 cows and angered the farmers. So, I ran away to free the slaves. Ended up running back to the farmers, followed by the slavers, and then to the city, where the fight alerted the orcs. So, I then had the orcs, the farmers and the slavers all chasing me, and the last cow had disappeared.\n\nWho could blame it?\n\nSo, I ran away into the woods, with the whole bunch following me, where they began fighting with the local wildlife. The woods were alive with the sounds of battle. Hiding, I stumbled across some grain thieves camped beside a cave filled with gigantic ants. The giant ants attacked everything, the grain theives attacked the orcs, the slavers and the orcs attacked the grain thieves, and in amongst it the wildlife had a go at whatever crossed its path.\n\nI sneaked away but ran into a pack of wolves and led them back to the ongoing epic confrontation in the woods via a bridge, whcih they then fell off one by one into a gully below. Some grain thieves arrived and I led them back across the bridge. They too failed to negotiate the bridge and fell into the gully with the wolves.\n\nI never did find the last cow.\n\nI suspect it fell out of the world with the shock of it all.\n\n13/10","August 6, 2014","true","81.3"," 285 of 306 people (93%) found this review helpful 324 people found this review funny","93","285","306","324","7"

Studing how the game mechanics work but also keeping a cool head for hours.\n\nPlease note even if I'm merely clocking about 50 hours of it on Steam as of this review, I've already played through the game with the DRM-free version of it and it took me over a month of playing this game daily without any rushing through.\n\nFurthermore this review has been written considering the following essential mod, depending on how you see it. It is about as detrimental for the game as the game itself.\n\n- Gothic 3 Enhanced Edition Patch v1.75 International release\n\nIt is highly recommended that you install this patch before you play this game.\n\nThere are a couple of other mods out there that enhance this game, like the "Questpaket" version 4.2, which has English subtitles available.\n\nAbout Gothic 3A lot of negative things can be said for a game like Gothic 3. It was released, as all releases of the Gothic series as a catastrophe. In 2006 at the time of release it was such a crash prone, bug ridden mess that almost nobody liked it, not even hardcore fans. Very similar to Gothic 1 it even was unbeatable because of the many bugs and problems. But since Piranha Bytes has a strong bond between them and the fanbase, they dicided to handle things over to the community. While some might argue that this is a rather lazy way of developing a game, a lot of others believe that the fans certainly knew for the best, sonsidering the unreasonably strict timeline publisher JoWood inflicted on Pyranha Bytes. After over 3 years of patching and care-taking, this game was finally able to become the greatness as envisioned by the developers but also the fans. It's considered the definite version of the game.\n\nYou also don't need to play through Gothic 1 and 2 in order to understand this games backstory. However, it can answer a lot of questions regarding the world, the Hero himself and his way to handle prople. Still, if you take your time reading through hundreds of pages of dialogues alone you can quickly grasps what happened around you.\n\nGameplay Gameplay-wise this game has the typical Hack and Slash action formula with the twist of also adding role playing elements in a different way as people knew already from previous Gothic games. Imagine a Game like Diablo with the freedom from games like Fallout but in third person, and you get what Gothic 3 is supposed to be. That might be the best way to describe this game.\n\nThe main theme of this game can also be considered its main gameplay aspect, and that is the theme of freedom both in the storyline and gameplay-wise you'll find yourself in a world that doesn't explain much to you. Because of that you should properly always think about focusing your skills so you can live an easy life and Gothic typicaly this game is anything but easy.\n\nFor instance and without spoilering of course there are quests in which the player has to defeat hundreds upon hundreds of enemies with the help of maybe one Non Player Character. Quests can range from simple "Kill this Person or this Monster" and fetch quests, to whole adventures based on exploration. Even non Gothic fans know about the infamous "Where is the Guro?" questline that only people who truely enjoy exploration found as it's entirely optional regarding the entire game itself and the reward is to travel throughout the game while finding interesting and secret things. This doesn't mean that this game is boring, as Hacking and Slashing is the main focus and leveling up itself offers so many options to choose from.\n\nTo give a few examples, there are 39 spells to choose from, and there are 23 passive skills to learn just for doing physical attacks or to defend yourself and there are much more different skills ranging from smithing, to stealing from someones pocket. All of them need learning points and you get 10 of them with each level up and while this sounds simple it merely gives you free room so you tackle the immense hordes of hundreds of enemies in the middle game.\n\nThe Gothic series is known to be very challenging and hardcore games and the third incarnation is no exception from this. Almost all of the several hundred Quests are available from the start of the game where the only true requirement is to find them if the player chooses to wander around looking for important "named" Non Player Characters. It has to be noted that this game is totally MASSIVE. Apart from MMORPGs, most single player games don't come close to this in scale. This can be intimidating for newcomers of the genre, as there is no fast travel or any form of help other than a compass. It takes about an hour to walk from the lower left to the upper right corner of the entire game. About 40 minutes if you choose to run (about twice as fast as walking) and wait for the stamina to replenish.\n\nAs you can walk to almost every place right after the start of the game and due to the freedom of this game it's totally up to you on how to handle things entriely your own way. However, with this freedom a lot of mistakes are bound to happen. As the Hero shapens the way you can desire to choose whatever you want so it's recommended to always think about your next step, like what you would like to skill next or if you really want to follow a specific quest.\n\nI haven't yet tackeled the general setting, but thats just because that this game is focusing on hardcore hack and slash gameplay that even hundreds of quests aren't exactly this eye-catching. The premise goes like this, you either join up with either the Orcs or Humans and kill those who are in charge of this entire ordeal. As every NPC is killable right from the start it's up to you to kill EVERYONE or follow the rules as set up in the beginning of the game. This may sound simple on paper but believe me its far from it, as you need lots of carefully planning to archive the main goals of this game.\n\nGraphics and SoundGraphically this game was amongst the prettiest in 2006 and as it actually stood the test of time says a lot about its graphical fidelity. To be honest the grass landscape of Myrtana alone looks almost as good as Skyrims and considering the age and budget gap of both games I believe thats surely an achievement.\n\nIn terms of sound however, this is one of the best games for the PC, ever. Seriously, if you even just enjoy good music you have to get this game right now. Kai Rozenkranz is a genius when it comes to creating atmospheric music that fits spot on into the game. However, there is one song that stands out negatively and thats the Battle music. It's always the same theme when you're fighting a usual enemy and after a few hundred hours this may get on your nerves. This is forgotten when the player finally reaches the city of Ishtar, where argueably the best music in the entire game plays and you'll find yourself again after spending hours upon hours of your free time into this game without noticing that it's dark outside already, in the real world of course.\n\nVerdictGothic 3 is a very ambitioned game and I believe that its too bad the project was cut short for release due to the old publisher. With the user created patches and mods mentioned above however I believe that this might be one of those games that will stay fun even after decades to come. I highly recommend everyone to buy this game when a Steamsale comes along if you're still not sure if this game might be of interest to you. If you think this game is interesting and you enjoy huge in scale RPGs with an oldschool soul, get this now.\n\nRecommended food while playingGerman Beer with Sausage and hot mustard","June 17, 2014","true","50.1"," 267 of 295 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","267","295","2","11"

The music, the background dialog, the quests and the storyline is what you will expect of the gothic series. It is extremely addictive and could eat your spare time easily.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dvk/recommended/39500/","dvk","Dyne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dvk/","632 products in account",""Gothic 3 scored only 8/10 because producer JoWood 'rushed out' production..." that's a funny complaint because an 8/10 from any major critic is a heavenly blessing upon a game like Gothic 3. Nobody who plays any of the Gothic or Risen games is ever on the fence about them; you either love them or wish that you could set the developer on fire.\n\nAllow me to explain:\n\nI love Gothic 3. I come back to it over and over even though by now the graphics are seriously dated (I had originally reviewed the game many years ago and called it beautiful) and I have discovered pretty much everything in the world that there is to discover. There are hours upon hours of quests and content in the game to keep you busy and most of them are pretty easy to figure out. Rarely do you have to trek across an entire continent (like in some other open world RPG's out there) in order to pick up item x and then walk all the way back to drop it off. It happens... but it's rare.\n\nAllow me to first address the number one thing anybody will ever criticize about any Pirhana Bytes game: The combat SUCKS! Even after official and community patches it's still one of the worst combat systems I've ever experienced and without a doubt the worst in an RPG. Let me save you some frustration though:\nIf you're fighting near a hill, ALWAYS make sure you're below the enemy; if you're fighting downhill you can't hit them for some reason.\nTrying to use any offensive spell other than fireball will most likely get you killed; don't invest any of your learning points into magic. In fact just use archery and you'll be a lot happier with combat once you get the better bows.\nIf you do have to fight in melee, just mash the attack button. Never block, it's useless. If the enemy backs up out of range and you can't close the distance, stop attacking for a second and right when they're about to strike, spam attack again.\nTwo handed weapons are super strong but while your character is powering up his swing, you will be murdered. With enough points in strenth a one handed sword can one-hit almost every enemy in the game.Like I said, combat is extremely unbalanced and poorly executed but once you get used to it, it's actually kind of funny. Near the very beginning of the game there is a literal army of orcs camped outside a castle and with very little training and the starting weapon I was able to single handedly kill every last one of them because for some reason they all wait for you to kill the guy you're attacking before another one attacks you. The only exception to that is with archers; they'll shoot you while you're fighting someone else.\n\nThe world is huge and unfortunately either due to how old the game is or simply poor design choices (a common theme with Pirhana Bytes' games) the quick travel system is horrible. You have to first find teleporter stones to a town or (very rarely) another location and then use them like an item. A neat idea but it just doesn't work well. For one thing, the cities are in some cases so far apart that even if you use a teleporter stone you still have to walk for 20 minutes to where you're trying to go. Since enemies and items never respawn this gets pretty boring in the mid-game. But on the plus side there is a lot to see and discover in the world; obviously not as much as say, Oblivion, but it gets relatively close (it has absolutely nothing on Skyrim, though).\n\nAs with all of the Gothic and Risen titles, the voice acting is a joke. In Gothic 3 this is compounded by the script also being a joke. I don't think it was given to a native English speaker for proofreading; if it was he just phoned it in that day. I would love to see a Gothic 3 movie that uses the actual game script. That would be comedy gold.\n\nThere isn't a WIDE variety of weapons but there are plenty to keep you progressing. Unfortunately theyre's always one obvious choice that's better than what you have, no real reason to experiment with other weapons. For example: I have never used an axe or a quarterstaff. There's no point. That would be really annoying in any other RPG but since, as I mentioned above, combat was little more than an afterthought by the developers of this game... you don't really notice. You just buy the next better weapon so that you can kill faster.\n\nMagic system is broken and they never bothered to fix it, don't even waste your time. Some of the spells have such a long "power-up" (super saiyan) time that you'll be dead before you ever get to see what they do. Having fireball scrolls can be useful in a pinch but they do about the same damage as a strong bow unless you waste a bunch of learning points strengthening your magic (and ultimately losing the game unless you're fairly experienced).\n\nSpeaking of learning points, in the Gothic games (and the first Risen) you level up differently than in other RPGs. You gain experience and gain a level like in other games but you don't get anything but learning points when this happens. You then have to find trainers to either increase attributes or teach you new skills. In the beginning of the game you level up super-fast but levelling eventually slows down and then stops so make sure you have a plan on where you want your character to go before you start spending learning points willy-nilly. I like this system, I just wish there were more levels in the game so that you could customize your character a bit more. You can really only MASTER one combat art which is why I say magic is useless... if there were more learning points available it'd be fun to play around with but it stunts your strength in melee or ranged combat.\n\nReagents for potions never grow back like they do in, say, The Elder Scrolls. On the surface this seems wrong but the fact that there are potions you can make that permanently increase one of your attributes or skills shows you why they did this. If you could just keep making those over and over again there would be no need to ever spend learning points. There are plenty of reagents in the world to make more healing potions than you will ever need, anyway. Honestly come to think of it I don't think I've ever made a healing potion. You find a ton just by fighting and opening chests.\n\nI could go on forever. It's difficult to explain what makes Gothic 3 a good time because, especially as a new player, you will rage quit a few times. You will hear some dialogue exchanges that make you think "why the hell am I playing this?". You will notice some of the skills or crafting recipes never got finished (only 2 or 3) and if you spend money to learn them you basically just wasted your money. Quests will break and you'll have to load a save (and in a couple rare cases I've found, completely start the game over).\n\nBut I love it.\n\nMaybe I'm a masochist.","June 5, 2015","true","166.2"," 106 of 122 people (87%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","87","106","122","39","8"

It's everything I love about RPG's - the freedom, the story, the impact you can make and the interactions with others (NPC's).\nBut installing Comunity Patch is strongly advised, also modding might be interesting for some (more info on both can be found in the discussions).\n\nPros:\n\n+ Great story line, that continues the adventures of our nameless hero from Gothic 1 and Gothic 2, but the game has dialogs for people who are not fammiliar with the first two games. If you meet someone  from the previous games, they will remember you, but you can ask them who tey are and usually with a whitty remark, they will remind you how you know them.\n\n+ It's an RPG, so you have your standart RPG elements:\n\n* You do quests, kill monsters, gain experience, level up, earn learning points and use them to learn a bunch of skills, like Hunting, Blacksmithing, Thievery, Alchemy, Magic (Anchient knowledge).\n\n* Each set of skills has it's own attributes, like Hunting has archery, improved archery and master archery. Learning points can also be used to increase your hitpoints, stamina or mana.\n\n* Wide vierity of weapons, also magic can be used in combat.\n\n* You can make your own weapons, potions and food.\n\n+ Fantastic soundtrack.\n\n+ Open world. You can go where ever you want and do what ever you want (be ware of consequenses, some monsters are strong as hell and will kick your beginer ♥♥♥).\n\n+ Three different lands with different climate, different people, different culture and seperate stories that in one way or another intertwine.\n\n+ You can beat up who ever you want (assuming you are skilled enough) and you can kill who ever you want (if you can beat them up or if you've learned Assasination).\n\n+ If you start a fight in a town that doesn't know you and isn't friendly, others will kick your ♥♥♥ (unless you can kick all of their ases :D ). Towns have rules - no fighting (unless you are well known :D)\n\n+ After you've beaten up someone and knocked them down, you can take their weapon and rob them.\n\n+ If you steal something in a town people will start to suspect you, You can try to talk your way out, but they might or might not fall for that. IF they see you stealing, be prepared to fight.\n\n+ If someone sees you killing someone in a town - be prepared to fight. If only one person saw you, you can kill him and get away with it, though others might suspect you're to blame, but just as with stealing, you can try to talk your way out of it. If a lot of people saw you, then you'll have to fight all the people in town.\n\n+ Friends will join your fights and will support you. If you fight a friend, however, others will cheer. :D\n\n+ You can pick sides. What will you choose. Who will you help. - it's up to you.\n\n+ There are a lot of quests and a lot of different mods.\n\n+ The moment you start a revolution...\n\n+ Open ending. The main story gives you a choice on how you'll end the game. And your choice along with your other actions and choices, will determan what future will look like.\n\n+ The game has one of the best gaming community and a Community Patch Team that has releaset the latest and final patch 1.75 that makes the game work and look a lot better. With the patch, you won't be able to tell that the game is so old. (More info on the patch can be found in discussions)\n\n+ The game has mods.\n\n+ The game has some surpises, like hidden diaries that tell a story no NPC knows.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Your decisions have consequences. This is a good thing, but it can actually ruin the game for you, if you did something and you don't know how it will impact the game. For example if you liberate too many towns before you do all the quests  for them, the town head will attack you and you'll loose dialogs and some quests.\n\n- It's a massive game and if you wan't to play it as best as you possibly can, you need to know a lot of stuff. This includes who to kill and who to spare and when, where to look for items etc.\n\n- Dialogs are important. This is nothing new and should be a norm, but sometimes gamers just like to skip dialogs and go kill beasts for no reason, but still get paid for it :D and in oh so many cases dialogs explain what and where you must do to finnish the quest, so skipping dialogs is unadwised. Luckily Quest log shows you the important parts of the dialog.\n\n- At times you will need google to help you with quests. There are quests that conterdict each other and you'll have to choose who's side will you take.\n\n- Some english voice acting is not the best. Other languages have it better.","January 8","true","81.9"," 80 of 85 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","80","85","2","3"

Basically, Gothic 3 was another victim of a publisher (JoWood) forcing a developer (Pirahna Bytes) into puppy-milling out a game before it was ready for prime time. G3 lingered as that one game I wanted to play and finish to get closure on the series, but the infuration of playing it was not worth it.\n\nUntil ...\n\nOver the years a Community Patch was created that fixed most of the nut-kicking issues. Folks said it was better once the patch was applied. So, I decided to take the plunge. I wasn't expecting stellar GOTY game play or awesome balance. I just wanted to grind through it to get the story and slay my great, white whale. Or, at the very least, come to terms with it over a nice cup of tea at the cafe while talking about old times.\n\nFor the most part, the patch makes G3 better. Much better.\n\nBut ... now we just get to the "normal" annoynaces that may put gamers off of it:\n\n* The Gothic universe is not for everyone. Dinosaurs are running around your savage, medival land. Factions and politics are abundant. Everyone cops an attitude with you (even your allies). It's not your prancy, elf-laden world of high-fantasy. It's like the Land of the Lost, The Lord of the Rings, Mobsters and the Elder Scrolls got together and had an illegitimate love-child.\n\n* There's obvious moral high/low ground, but it's up to you to decide how to go. Orcs hate humans (you're human), but you don't get auto-attacked in Orc towns. This may throw some folks for a loop when they first play, them pulling out a weapon to assault an Orc town without realizing you can just walk in and talk to folks instead. If you like to shoot first and ask questions later, Gothic may not be the series for you.\n\n* The story just picks up where G2 left off. And I'm not talking vanilla G2, I'm talking the Night of the Raven (?) add-on / expansion. If you've never played G1 or G2, you're going to be lost. There's bits and pieces of back-story thrown at you, but you'll still be lost. Even reading an overview online will leave you lost. You can play it as a stand-alone game / story, but you'll get reminders here and there that you're missing a part of the back-story.\n\n* Per Gothic's SOP, you start out as a wuss-bag, and slowly, desperately, try to claw your way up. Even with the patch's combat / AI balancing, combat is still a brutal affair. Every Gothic has been that way, so fair warning. However, G3 (pre-patch) was notorious for having low-level wolves gang-r@ping your high-level character with machine-gun-like lunge attacks en masse while a low-level character was able to use a polearm to easily dispatch high-level trolls. So... yes, the patch did balance combat ... a LOT. But, combat is still brutal. Upgrades to armor are majorly expensive. Upgrades to weapons come slowly. The skill progression system is a slow grind, having to spend points to raise skill levels just as points of entry to unlock actual skills you want. (EG: you have to spend skill points to learn an arbitrary level of alchemy skill to unlock your ability to learn to craft mana potions, or transformation potions, or permanant potions. Does a higher alchemy skill level help you? No. It just acts as a gate-keeper to unlock those skills. So, you'll feel like you wasted a lot of skill points raising skill levels that ultimately did nothing but act as gatekeepers.) You will have to very carefully pick-n-choose your combats, because you will get your rear handed to you over and over... even on easy mode!\n\n* Load times still suck a big one ... I'm not kidding. One reason I gave up G3 back when was because the load times from a HDD took like a minute or two! And saving took time, too. This is the kind of game you want to quick-save and reload, because you will bork things up time and again. Getting punished with a 2 minute reload time EVERY time you did somethign stupid or found out some wuss-creature was able to own you was just torture. If you have an SSD, then they are manageable, but still expect to wait 10-20 seconds.\n\n* Combat is still a tad glitchy post-patch. Making special note of this, because you will still find some animals that seem to lean back and magically avoid all of your attacks even though you see your stupid weapon going right through them. Then they lunge in and nail you. It's not as bad post-patch, but it still happens.\n\n* Quests are banal sometimes ... you will get the usual "go here, kill this, fetch this, deliver that" junk. But, you grind those for xp and levels. The real merit of the game is when you get to decide how to overall play it. Will you side with the humans or the orcs? Is it time to liberate a town? If so, how? (Will you side with some rebels to take it over, or go in solo?) Each move you make impacts your rating with factions, so if you liberate enough towns your rating with the orcs will go down and they will attack you on site going forward. Or, you can go wipe out those nasty rebels for the orcs.\n\n* Walking ... so ... much ... walking.  The game world is overly huge, and you'll get stuck aimlessly wandering about. It can be fun exploring, and they try to coax you into hitting the cities in a certain order. But, you can go and do whatever you want. They try to cordone off certain areas by putting harder monsters in your way, but you can run past them or jump up mountains to get around. You can go places you "shouldn't" early on as you please. You'll get your rear handed to you, but it can be fun. But, the game world is flipping huge, and trotting every where will waste hours of your time. Fortunately they put in teleporter stones you can carry to help you get from town to town faster, but you have to find the stone for each town. That can be tricky sometimes (especially when it's hidden in a place that's restricted until you win the town leader's favor). So, break out your walking shoes.\n\n\nOverall...\n\nWould I recommend G3? Yes, but only if you played G1 & ♥♥♥♥nd liked them.\n\nWould I recommend G3 without the Community Patch? No. Heck no. You have to go to a separate web-site to get the community patch, and once it's installed it's installed. And, if you already started a save game you'll need to restart the game (it invalidates pre-patch save games). So, install G3, install the Community Patch, then play the game. Don't even open or play G3 without the community path.","December 11, 2014","true","73.3"," 75 of 80 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","75","80","5","2"

For me, Gothic 3 has the strongest implementations of an open world fantasy environment for its time.  Sure, games like Skyrim do this better but Gothic 3 has to be viewed in the context of when it was released.  Gothic 3 came out in 2006, the same year as Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion (Skyrim was released 5 years later).  In comparison to Oblivion, it has a larger open world that feels lush, diverse, and interesting, whereas Oblivion's environments often felt cut/paste replicated to me.  Sure, Gothic 3 has some serious issues when it comes to things like the combat system, the variety of the quests, bugs, etc. but it shouldn't be written off completely.  It's simply not as bad as some people have said.  There's a lot of good here and if you love open world RPGs and I strongly feel this game has been overlooked.","November 27, 2013","true","85.9"," 48 of 59 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","48","59","0","3"

It has quests, from killing wolves to finding underground agents.\nSome people say the fighting is bad and that it's too easy, but it's actually good when fighting dozens of enemies at once because you stand a chance.\n\nStory and quests:\nYou arrive on a land named Myrthana. It was conquered by the orcs and humans still try to recapture their cities. There are 3 paths: You can either side with the humans and try to take back the kingdom, side with the orcs and your friend Xardas and set on a secret mission (I won't spoil it,  but it's really interesting) or you can choose to destroy everyone, but this is a path I haven't tried myself. The game has a complex reputation system which shows what different factions think about you. You will eventually have to travel to Varant (a desert land) to complete your secret mission or to Nordmar (an Icy continent) to help the humans. You can travel to both continents and do the quests there without following any path.\n\nSound:\nIn my opinion, the soundtrack is very good, but the orcs make a weird and repetitive sound when you hit them.

It's an old school fantasy RPG that doesn't do a ton of hand holding and is difficult enough that you actually feel like you've achieved something.\n\nIt's a large non-linear world that rewards exploration and has quests involving slaughtering entire towns--towns full of fleshed out NPC's that have been giving you quests, etc.\n\nFor a 2006 game, the graphics have held up well, and are something along the lines of the first Witcher or Morrowind.\n\nIt has some quirks, like a quest to forge the most powerful weapon in the world resulting in something about half as effective as the standard weapon carried by every orc--but if you step back from trying to power game and just enjoy the world and what you're doing to change it--and you have choice about how you want to change it--it is fun.\n\nI've really enjoyed it more than any of the Witcher or Elder Scrolls games.\n\nTonight I was killing off a town that I had decided needed to be killed off.  I was using a pole arm as I was fighting 50+ opponents at once, and the reach helps with defense in that case while side swipes can hit 4-5 opponents in front of you.  I had taken up a position in a doorway so I couldn't be flanked, and the dead were piling up in front of me, and I started to get the feeling I was being buried underneath the dead.  I paused the game to figure out what was causing that impression, and discovered, there were around 15 corpses in front of me trying to fall down, but they couldn't because I and the walls around me blocked them on the front and the waves of enemies behind them blocked them from the back. So neither I nor my live opponents could reach each other through the corpses pressed too tightly between us to fall.\n\nCorpse physics that affects combat.  In a 2006 game.  Not something I'd heard anyone even mention about the game--just one of those little details you notice playing it.\n\n","May 6","true","98.9"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","20","21","4","0"

Unfortunately the game was forcedly released before is was complete so the base version is full of bugs.\nAfter you have installed both the game and the CP you can play.\n\n\n\nG1 G2 comparison:\n\nDiffers from Gothic 1 and Gothic 2, you still play as the nameless hero but:\nNo chapters. You have a few main quest to complete. There are 6 reputation in the game and you have to choose who you want to support. There are 3 different way you can end the game based on your decisions.\nAttributes: Strength, Mana, Dexterity, HP (no longer increase with lvl up, you can raise them by using ability points), Stamina (NEW, for combat and sprint) Ancient Knowledge (NEW, for magic), Thief skill (NEW), Smith skill (NEW),  Alchemy (NEW).\nThe ability points can now be spent in talents. In order to learn a talent you need a specific amount of points in its attribute (ex: 1h sword II req. 150 str. ex: crafting mana pots req. 20 alchemy).\nThe combat mechanics is completly different. You can now dual wield 1h swords or using 1h sword and a shield. There are different attack types (it's not just left click spam all game long, unless you play on "very easy")  but the main difference is that you now have a stamina bar. If you are low on stamina your attaks will be slower, you can't parry/block properly, you can't perform some power attack,  you can't sprint.\n\n\n\nFinal Judge:\n\nEven if the G2 NotR storyline is the best by far, in terms of pure gameplay i thinks G3 is better thanks to the new talents system. The map is really huge and filled with secret areas.There are a lots of different quests and even an easter-egg like the G1's. A single play can last 100h+ (i'm at 64h doing less than 2/3 of the map). The interface is more user friendly, you have a 10 item slot bar where you can put weapons, foods, magics and bind them with hotkeys (1->0). Now you can cook/craft huge quantity with just one click (it ask how many instead of left clicking on the fire 50 times) and also loot easly with the "pick all" button (or rightclick on corpes with CP). Pots and foods now restore a % of you max health/mana instead of a flat number.\n\n\n\nGame Mode:\n\nWith the CP you can choose 2 different play style. The base mode and the advanced mode. The advanced mode rebalances the talent trees, so it's harder (probably impossible) to build a balanced hero that can do everything by unlocking all the talents.\n\n\n\nI played as:\n\n- 1h sword + shield warrior, both easy and boring since you can win any 1v1 duel but it's really hard when you're surrounded by enemies and so you have to do some cheesy pull to avoid that.\n- mage, really funny. A bit hard in the beginning since you have to hit and run to regen you mana pool and the staffs deal less dmg than swords (obv.) but when you've learned the mana reg. talent and you have a decent mana pool it's really enjoyable. It's not broken as the G2 mage that one-shots anything or deals no dmg at all.\n\n\nOthers:\n\nI know there are mods but i never tried them.\nGood Soundtrack\n\n\n\nTips:\n\nI do not recommend the highest difficulty for your first run since you need to learn the combat system first. If you really want to start with the hard mode, just save after the inizial cutscene becouse you're going to die a lot of times :P\n\nSince the decisions you make can really impact the game, if you want to do the most quest possibile don't rush things, just talk with every one and accept as many quest as you can. Even if killing everyone is fun it may have bad consequence on your game plan.\n\nYou can open the inventory during a fight and the game just pause. So you can regen your hp by drinking pots or eating foods without getting attacked. I know this mechanic sounds really lame and it wasn't possibile in G1 and G2 but the game is almost impossibile sometimes without using it.","February 2","true","65.3"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","24","28","3","2"

Filled with quests galore, its only mishaps is the combat system and extremely high system requirements. The journey now continues with Gothic 3 that improves some of the mishaps from the previous two however added a few more. That’s not to say to ride is game off as the world is massive, filled with some of the most gorgeous vistas I have ever seen in a long while thus making it an explorer’s heaven to boot.\n\nBecause of the massive open ended world, to complete the game wholly depends upon what you do. If you are aiming just to finish of the main quest, then don’t play this. This game is designed to be explored from top to bottom and from left to right. It’s a huge world with plenty of things to discover and accomplish. The unfortunate thing is that some quests tends to be repetitive (there’s so much that I can take when ask to defeat so-and-so during those arena quests) however don’t let that deter you. So if you are planning to complete this game the way it’s designed, it can take easily close to 100 hours. For me, at the time of this review recorded close to 120 hours and I still got a quarter of the map to discover and then revisit  the world again to finish off the main quest line.\n\nGranted at the time of release, the game was a buggy mess. Maybe the dispute between publisher JoWood and developer Piranha Bytes have something to do with this. Piranha Bytes ‘left’ the game with version 1.12 (still in a buggy state) however the community, yet again, saved the day. April 2012 saw the latest version 1.75. It’s a sad state of affairs though as if the game ended at version 1.12, we will never get to see the game in its fullest glory. Version 1.75 still have minor issues however, and thankfully so, we get the see the game for what it was meant to be. An ambitious game in term of size however the world, whilst beautiful to explore, it still felt not as ‘alive’ as in Gothic 2. A definite explorer’s paradise to boot though.\n\n7.5 / 10 (basing on community patch 1.75 – without it, it will be a dismal 4).\n\nFull review: http://www.gamespot.com/gothic-3/user-reviews/2200-12684943/","March 3","true","169.1"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","18","20","2","0"

It's the original Piranha Bytes and not Jowood's repurposed attached naming Arcania, nor their butchered works of Gothic 3 Forsaken Gods.  Most would prefer of the series the Gothic 2 as their favorite, but I prefer Gothic 3 for its community patches, content packs, and revised combat system, that makes use of button combinations for different attacks, of parry, reposte, slash, poke, and kill shots, as well, for a game that came out nearly a decade ago, it can still push a system, due to its complete open world nature, and openGL based engine.  For that reason, I still use it for testing systems max volume decibel level on fans of gpus.  This game has gotten better with age, and it shows with special thanks to an active community of content refiners.  I look forward to and have high hopes of the return to Myrtania in the next true Gothic named sequel with Piranha Bytes at the helm again.  This series holds a special place in my heart, and the soundtrack is masterfully written, and captures the scale and variety of locales.  With a lot of voice acting, multiple ways to play, and freedom to go wherever you wish, this game has managed to keep me occupied full of episodic gameplay that I can pick up and put down whenever I like.  This is truly a game I would love to see how much better it could look, if it got a remastering or High resolution facelift as it would still be worth buying for the 6th time.  If you like action rpgs that give you the ability to be in 3rd person, 3\4 view, and first person view with a plethora of myth and lore to boot, you owe it to yourself to give this game, and franchise a try.","June 20, 2014","true","9.8"," 35 of 52 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","35","52","0","0"

That is when I got it on steam. I actually got the game on a CD first(saddly the CD broke and lost all my saves >.<), and I've clocked well over 60 hours on that. I don't know my exact time but i've seen and played a lot of this game.\n\nMuch like the Gothic series, this games boasts a HUGE landscape to explore. Even if you look on the top world view(main map) That is about half the map as their is a whole other level to the game, the amount of caves and tunnel you have to explore is huge as well. The areas you have to explore are beautiful and some scenes you can just stand there watching it for awhile. The map is huge for a game that doesn't give your a great fast-travel system, but that is the fun of an open world game, them forcing you to explore.\n\nThis game, is unfinished though, even the developers came out saying that the people who put them up to it, rushed the game to be released long before it was ready. So you will find caves that are completely empty, pockets of pitch blackness even with a torch. Grass and trees that don't match the landscape. Even some areas that are just empty of anything. Anyone who has played through and explored the map has seen this, it does mark the game as not completed. Now, if they had completed the game, it might have been THE best game of that time, but, who knows, they never did.\n\nComabt wise, the game is very simplistic, it goes on a 'duel' system, so you'll rarely have 2 or more people gang up on you, so it is mostly 1v1, even if you are surrounded by an army. Your moves consist of the same thing and it's very easy to kill the enemies. Saying that though, any archers or magic users are not afraid to cast their spells at you, even when your already fighting someone, and spells in this game are VERY unforgiving, some even doing a 1 or 2 hit on you. What makes this game all the harder, is that there is no auto-save feature. So you will have to manually save. It's smart to save every time you enter and leave a town, this game will make you a spastic saver. Getting killed with a sword or axe though, is just as easy, as the computer gets the exact same attack patterns you do, and if your not careful, you can be quickly killed off. (Basicly, once they start a combo and you can't break it, your dead.). Archery works fantasic and forces you to aim and be accurate, shields actually do their job, I.E. stopping arrows from hurting you and magic... magic is a ♥♥♥♥♥ sometimes. Overall, the combat is wonky and unforgiving sometimes, but workable.\n\nThe quests, although quite simple at times, range wide, towns usually consist in the same but you'll find that the game does follow the progress so, killing off an orc town, well, that means going into any other orc towns wont be easy. This game also has quest that spans the continants. For instance, one quest, for you to get a boat skimatic, which is roughly the middle of hte map, well, to get said skimatic you have to go to the south, into the varrent, a desert, well, sorry, the guy wants ice wolf pelts, and those, can only be found in the north in nordmar. The game makes you travel to this fantastic areas to grab something, it is truely amazing the amount of work was put into this game that wasn't even finish.\n\nThis game lacks polish, that is evident in the fact they got rushed to release it, I don't blame the dev's for that, you can only do so much in a certain amount of time and your not allowed to push over. If you can look past it's flaws the game is great, the story is lacking somewhat and isn't that straight forward, but, it makes you take your time and explore.  Overall, it is a good game for those who don't mind the lack of polish and the sometimes wonky gameplay. I've loved playing it and I think many others will too.\n\nQuick tip to anyone wanting to get this. Focus on leveling up and getting lots of quests done before truely picking a side. You'll get twice the amount of quests.","September 29, 2014","true","30.4"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

This is a game where you can explore a huge world filled with many things and quests.\n\nUnlike Skyrim where the world feels empty, Gothic 3 does a great job in making the world feel pretty much alive. The main character can sneeze while idling by the way. Just so you know.\n\nThe combat is good, you have to pay attention to what is everyone doing. The enemies attacks you one by one giving you a chance against an army of orcs, but you can be backstabbed if you're not careful so beware!\n\nThe graphics. It doesn't beat Crysis, but it looks quite amazing and gives a very nice feeling and atmosphere in overall. The textures are not that great though.\n\nAs for story, this game doesn't require you to have played Gothic 1 and 2, but knowing the story at least of the previous games will help in understanding what's happening in Gothic 3 better.\n\nFinally, if you get this game, make sure to install Community Patch (currently latest is 1.75.14). It will solve many many problems and gives you more graphical options such as HDR or FXAA.

There's nothing "gothic" about it, except that you're still playing as the nameless hero, and old friends make small cameos. The combat is clunky, the animations suck, it lags alot (even if your computer is amazing). The story is non-existent; you start off looking for Lester, which is fine with me, if I actually found him within the first 2 hours of gameplay. The story revolves around nothing: either liberating cities from orcs, or destroying rebel camps. Same thing happens in the desert region: liberating cities from the hassashin, or destroying the nomads. The only part with an actual story is when you venture into the cold mountains of Nordmar. And for an ending, there is no epic bossfight, or talk with the main characters. You get 3 "mass effect 3" endings, depending on what god you choose to follow.\n\nThe most offensive part, to me, was the interaction between the hero and Xardas. As someone who grew up with the Gothic Series, Xardas is one of the most interesting characters I have ever seen. He walks a blurred line between anti-hero and villain, by using the nameless hero for his own nefarious purposes. I won't spoil what exactly he does, but his role in Gothic 3 is awful. There is a 6 hour goose-chase through the myrtanian continent to find Xardas, and when you finally find him, all he does is give the hero some pointless information. This happens to every character, with a few exceptions. Diego, the master thief and cunning rogue, turned into a laughable traveling mercinary. Gorn, the ruthless warrior, is captured by orcs. ORCS! Lester becomes a slave for the orcs in varant. Milten is the only one who retains his prior credability. This is unacceptable. These are the characters who made the first and second Gothic feel immersive and memorable, and they have been reduced to nothing more than laughable shadows of their pasts.\n\nThe game only becomes playable with the Enhanced Edition Community Patch, which you can download for free. This patch adds performance tweaks, and a much needed price overhaul.\n\nIn conclusion, ♥♥♥♥ this game. If you played the 1st and 2nd gothic, then give this one a shot just for the continuation of the story. But if you didn't...\nSTAY FAR AWAY","March 2, 2014","false","74.7"," 63 of 105 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","63","105","0","0"

You start the game with you’re 4 companions and kill  some orcs, after that they all leave and give you a total of one quest each when you find them, if you did not play Gothic 1 and 2 you would be asking yourself why are they so important that they get a ending resolution.\nAnd pretty much applies for the rest of the game, you go to a city,  you talk to anyone that has a name, then you go to the rebels that have names, you do all the quests that are neutral and move one to the next city. You lack any care for most of the tasks you are given. because they are mostly a source of XP and money. The hero is the only interesting character because he does not take anything seriously and comments about repeating cliches you have to go through.\nLeveling up is a costly business, every attribute, skill or spell costs a fortune, and makes it so that at certain points in the game I had over 200LP but because I was saving money, they ware useless, nobody gives you skills for free. When you actually manage to get that much money and actually have some fun, the game is great, it’s a shame it has to be such a chore to get there.\nThe game looks graphically better than G1 and G2, however it has stutter issues that might even freeze your game. The game does not close properly sometimes.  Beasts and NPCs may clip through the terrain during combat, a few times a beast was stuck below the ground but kept fallowing me and NPC ware reacting to a beast nearby, but could not attack it.\n\nCombat: Range is not auto-lock you actually have to aim, melee and magic are auto-lock making it difficult when fighting more than one enemy.\nMelee, a difficult task that boils down to who can stun-lock the other first unless they block.\nRange, get a rock and hope the lack range weapons.\nMagic, this time I actually played mostly as a mage and it was a lot of fun, mostly because you can get regenerating mana(eventually), it was the only combat that made the game reasonable and satisfying.\nThe Gothic Trilogy at least gets a proper closer.","March 16, 2015","true","119.0"," 33 of 51 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","33","51","3","4"

Though the initial release was quite buggy, the community patch available these days turns it into a very playable game.  This review will assume you are playing with the patch installed, as described in my instructions here:\n\nGothic 3 Optimization Steps\n\nGothic 3 is a classic open world first/third person RPG like Elder Scrolls, so there are many similarities between them.  In a way it is a mix of many of the good parts of both Morrowind and Oblivion, though there are also some general differences from Elder Scrolls that should be covered first.\n\nThere is no character creation: you will play as the male human nameless hero, period.\n\nThere is no respawning of creatures or flora; once you clear an area, it will remain clear.\n\nThere are basically no books of lore or other reading material for people who like to spend hours reading about the history and culture of the world.  That said, I think the Gothic 3 world often has more detail than what is found in Elder Scrolls games and does a good job using those details to flesh it out.  Every detail of the world often feels carefully hand-placed, such as this screenshot of the entrance to Montera, with individual stones spread around from the broken walls after war with the Orcs:\n\nRuins of Montera\n\nGothic 3's world is also completely seamless: there is no loading between areas, not going into houses, into caves, between the different major regions, never.  This has a huge positive impact on the overall experience, since it really feels like a completely open world, and in practice you can take advantage of this with tricks to get to places you aren't yet ready to go.  You will often find yourself in this kind of situation, looking on an open city thinking about the ways you can go about exploring and exploiting it:\n\nLooking down on Bakaresh\n\nGothic 3 is more "gamey" than Elder Scrolls games.  The Elder Scrolls games try for a certain sense of realism, as a way I think to try to make them more "immersive."  Gothic 3 in contrast tends to wear being a game on its sleeve: character progression is very numeric with learning points you use to raise stats and gain skills along with gold needed to pay to do so; tactics you use for success in the world are often based on playing it as a game (rather than what is "realistic").  Even the main character's voice acting often makes me feel like he is self-aware of being in a game and giving another sarcastic comment about another freaking fetch quest.\n\nIf immersive realism is something you find really important, that isn't Gothic 3's style.  However, its gamey-ness has benefits: not being realistic allows the art design to be much more interesting (I often say I feel like I am wandering around a beautiful painting), allows it to have a more exaggerated scale compared to how Elder Scrolls games try hard to hide their gamey world scale, and it can just be fun to figure out all kinds of tricks and ideas to take advantage of Gothic 3's more visible game systems.\n\nMaybe Gothic 3's world isn't as immersive, but in many ways I find it more interesting and engrossing.\n\nThose differences asside, there are many more similarities between Gothic 3 and Morrowind/Oblivion.\n\nIn many ways, Gothic 3 sits somewhere between Morrowind and Oblivion in experience.  It came out soon after Oblivion, and has many of the improvements that one would expect from that generation of games, yet still has many of aspects of Morrowind that were lost in Oblivion.  That isn't to say that it the best of both games, but it has a nice combination that may appeal to people who loved Morrowind but found Oblivion lacking.\n\nGothic 3's graphics are in the same class as Oblivion.  It has a lush, dynamic world (with moving grass and trees), dynamic shadows and lighting, fairly high resolution textures, and is comparably rich, detailed, and complex.\n\nThe world is a more traditional fantasy environment compared to Morrowind's interesting alien world, but doesn't suffer from the blandness of Oblivion.  It has three unique environments: the central lush wilderness region, southern desert, and northern snowy area; the world also feels much more hand-crafted, with little details everywhere you look and very little repetition.\n\nAll of the dialog in Gothic 3 is spoken -- both NPCs and your own character.  This results in quests and dialog being along the lines of Oblivion: more simplistic than Morrowind.  However the world is huge, with a lot going on, and is much more connected together than in Oblivion, adding more complexity that way.  Even most of the side quests (including simple fetch quests) are fairly connected to the larger picture, since they will impact the feelings of the factions towards you and how you can further interact with them and decide how the game will progress.\n\nThe music in Gothic 3 is fantastic.  The sheer quantity of it is at the level of Oblivion if not more, but it is not in the background and bland.  The quality is much more like Morrowind: strong melodic pieces that will transport you back to the world when you hear them again.  It is also much more connected to the world, with very distinctive themes for the three different regions and even sub-regions of those.  The first time you walk over a desert hill to view some ruinfields stretching out away from you, with their theme playing along, is not something you will forget.\n\nGothic 3's world has a lot of verticallity, much like Morrowing and something I found lacking in Oblivion.  It doesn't go so far as to have a levitation spell, but the world itself is filled with interesting use of height which you can use to your advantage or can get in your way.  You will often find yourself looking up at something and trying to figure out how you can get up to it.  For example, this huge hill in the distance that begs you to figure out how to get up there to check it out:\n\nNew goal in life: get up there\n\nOr this view after trekking up a high mountain pass down on to the open castle and city below:\n\nLooking down on Faring\n\nIn these games I tend to prefer bows over swords, and for that I find Gothic 3's combat to be far better than Morrowind and a bit lesser than Oblivion.  It doesn't have the physical presence that Oblivion was able to create, such as the satisfaction of sneak attacks with bows and physicality of swords and shields, but does have fairly fun interactions for aiming and shooting bows, blocking with shields, etc.  Sword and shield play is maybe a bit more tactically interesting than Oblivion, since there are different moves you can make and you need to watch the moves of humanoid characters to determine when they are going to make themselves vulnerable.  Fighting creatures I find to be much less satisfying, with them easily getting past your defense; in fact I seem to often find myself looking for high ground I can take to shoot arrows or bolts at them while they can't reach me, much like using a levitation spell to the same effect in Morrowind.  (I have also not been above leading some creatures back to a city for the guards there to help me take them out.)\n\nFinally, there are basically no physics in Gothic 3, which is a negative compared to Oblivion...  but then again compared to how little of interest Oblivion did with physics, maybe not.  Characters do have rag dolls when you kill them and the equipment in their hand will go flying.","August 13, 2012","true","94.4"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","3"

It is an inimaginable game for that time and I strongly suggest you to play it.\n\nIn Gothic3 you can be whatever you want, you can fight for the Orcs or for the Humans, you can be from a full thief to a hero, from a strong warrior to a smart age, you can end it in different ways, it's all about you. You have all the freedom you want, but you explore it at your own risk. You have a lot of side quests and a great main quest line. It is more action-orientated than other Gothic games because you will fight with your own army (yes, your own army!) for saving cities from enemies, etc.\n\nI suggest you to play it's predecessors to see how much the game evolved and because the storyline continues from the end of Gothic2. For all of those saying: "I am a Gothic fan, but I don't like Gothic3!" well, then you are not a Gothic fan, why could you say something like that? Same storyline, same characters, same awesome hero, it is not Arcania, it is Gothic3, it is really good and unlike Arcania they really keep the storyline.\n\nAbout the Community Patch, yes, you need it for the game to run well, but if you can play a better game, why should you complain about the Community Patch?

The game is not playable without it ;P\n\nAll in all a great, old rpg. If you liked Gothic1+2, you´ll also love this part. Lots of swearing, nice dialogues, diversified quests, character building. Still got its old Gothic spirit.\n\nThe only thing I hated (and I REALLY hated it) was the combat system. Either become a mage or some ranger, don´t focus too much on melee, because fighting is really clunky and even in endgame, when you got used to it all, not really that great. I spent 80% of my fights either running away and shooting the enemy with my bow or standing on some plateau/wall/stone where they couldn´t get me and shoot em down from there. Heck, even the enemies often have massive problems attacking you: a lot of enemies can be beaten by simply walking backwards and shooting them. They´ll catch up to you, swing their weapon, walk up to you again, swing their weapon...without hitting you. Not to mention that sometimes the arrows just fly through the enemies (especially snappers, damn beasts...).\nIN A NUTSHELL: Focus on ranged attacks and you´ll be fine.\n\nNice, enjoyable, LONG(!) game, good soundtrack, makes a (imo) good end to the story.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves RPGs with a more action oriented combat system and is willing to take the time to patch the game with the community patch and is looking to scratch that itch that comes with an open world RPG; endless hours of exploration, quest, crafting, character development, factions to join and fight, a world to shape the way you see fit, gaining new powers and seeing new sights. Gothic 3 is a very buggy game by itself admittedly but, for $10 and a loving community who is AWESOME and has worked out most of the bugs and revamped the game to be more balanced and run smoother, it is easily worth the time and effort and frustrations that may come with it..\n\n-Thumbs Up from Royial\n\n\nVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork","February 8, 2013","true","20.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Also, you really have to download the community patches to make these games come to life due to early pushing of the producer.  The community has done a great job to maintain this game as well as fix almost all bugs from the first 3 in the series.  Have yet to play the 4th game but look forward to it.

I loved gothic 1 and 2, I grew up with these RPGs. Gothic 1, while still rather clunky in its mechanics and controls, is still very enjoyable, thanks to the great world, characters and story. Gothic 2 took everything good from Gothic 1 and made it even better. Less clunky controls, smoothed out mechanics, bigger world, better story, more characters to like. It was pure Action RPG bliss.\nWhile Gothic 2 from a technical standpoint was just a more polished Gothic 1, Gothic 3 has nothing in common with it's prequels, technically speaking. And it just ♥♥♥♥♥ over everything that made the original 2 games so great. The World is bigger? Sure, but it's also got less stuff to do in. The graphics have more polygons and stuff? Sure, but it looks so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ugly and somewhere between plastic and rubber. The story? What story? You move from town to town, decide if you root out the rebels or the orcs, goto next town, repeat. Same for the Desert, except the factions names are different. In Gothic 1 and 2, stuff happened, there was tension, there was drama. In Gothic 3, nothing happens. Sure you liberate some cities and stuff, but it doesn't really tell a story, you just grind through progression.\nThe Combat in this game is one of the most hillariously broken messes I've ever seen. First of all, go full one handed melee in this. Archery or even magic is just not worth it. Which is ironic, considering how ♥♥♥♥ing overpowered enemy mages are. You'd think your level 20 hero would have no problem fighting a measly goblin mage. ♥♥♥♥ that noise, he deals an insane amount of damage. My only strategy left was to basically circle around him so that his fireballs miss me and hope I get close enough to pummel him into the ground before he incinerates me. And there was that one time I fought an Orc Shaman. He got stuck in a doorway and spammed fireballs at the nearby wall. So I just pulled out my bow and slowly chipped away his health from afar. As he was almost dead, he quickly pulled out a healing spell, fully healed himself and switched back to the fireball. That took him just a second. All my effort worthless.\nIt's unbalanced beyond believe. Wanna kill almost every humanoid in close quarters combat? Spam light attacks. Everytime you hit an enemy, they will flinch and then reset to normal combat stance, before they can strike. Flinching+striking takes more time than a light swing. You'll cut through anything with that. And as cool as poisoning your blade sounds, it's useless. In order to apply the poison to your enemies, you have to stab them by holding the attack button and pressing down. Normal strikes don't poison your enemy. But why would you do that, the stab takes way too long. Also dualwielding Swords is only usefull, because it allows you to attack with two swords at once with heavy swings, but not with light swings.\n\nOverall: This game is ♥♥♥♥. Be glad you don't have to play Version 1.0, that taught me to fear boars. They were able to bite faster than I could counter, so I was locked in an endless flinching frenzy, which only ended once I was dead.","August 23, 2014","false","0.9"," 24 of 45 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","24","45","3","0"

Contrary to what most fans complained and still complain, this game is a dream come true. PB delivered to us what anguished us all along. Nordmar, the northern land inhabited by rough warriors and blacksmiths, the legendary smiths that you read and hear about all along. Varant, the last place where Lee fought against the 2 Varantian warlords. Myrthana, your homeland, goverened by King Rhobar himself. The one, who convicted you to the Penal Colony.\n\nAnd while the main storyline is not completely dull, what kills the most important aspect of the game is the faction system. No matter what you are, Orc Mercenary, Hashishin, Paladin, Druid..no one will greet you or remark about those things. Gothic 2 did it right and for that it will always be my favourite.\n\nAll of these factions, quests, places are laid out in a non-linear environment  waiting for you to explore it. Accompanied by majestic soundtracks. Make sure you install the last Community Patch from WorldofGothic.com and enjoy it to the fullest.\n\n","November 20, 2014","true","50.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

It's an open world RPG just like Skyrim or oblivion, you have to get the latest community patch to make it playable.\n\nIt's a faction based system where you visit each city hub and complete all quests related to that city. The world is divided into three areas, forest, dessert, and snow. Towards the end you make a choice on which faction to support.\n\nCombat in the beginning is quite hard, it's recommended to avoid some areas for later. As you level up and obtaining new skills, it gets easier. Enemies don't level up with you.\n\nIt's an older game from 2006, it still can be taxing on your system. It's quite epic, although it does get quite dull towards the end.

The world is so immersive, the game is comepletly open world. The world itself is consistent on making you feel like you are actually in the world. The combat system is not the best, but its not like the boring point and click, it is heavily skill based and you will have a permanent death after a certain number of times you have collapsed.  Overall It mixes the great points of Witcher 2 and the immersiveness of the Elder Scrolls series. NOTE this game is very, and I say it again VERY long, thats why I like it so much.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/furrjacker/recommended/39500/","furrjacker","Furr Jacker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/furrjacker/","262 products in account","Gothic 3 is an Action-RPG and is the 3rd game in the series and at the moment I consider it the last game (unless Piranha Bytes does something with the license again). Never before have I had such mixed feelings over a game, there's so much potential that was never fully realized and the negatives of the game really overshadow the positives. The reason being is that Gothic 3 was never finished, Jowood, the game's publisher, decided one day to just say "♥♥♥♥ it, let's release the game" and it was nowhere near finished, if Piranha Bytes was given more time, then this would've been a fantastic game, but as it stands, it's an extremely buggy and frustrating mess that underneath it lies what could've been a worthy addition to the Gothic series.\n\nThe story continues from where the second game left off, you arrive at mainland Myrtana and find out that the orcs have won the battle because the mages and the paladins have lost their power at some point or something, and now orcs are the new rulers thanks to Xardas, so when you arrive with your friends and liberate a little village called Ardea, you have to find Xardas and fix this whole mess. Overall, the story is pretty terrible, it goes all over the place and more often than not you just forget that there even is a story, but the setting is great, humanity is essentially ♥♥♥♥ed and the orcs are the new rulers and you get to decide whether you join the rebels and liberate Myrtana or join the orcs.\n\nLet's start with the presentation: This game, even to this day, looks absolutely gorgeous, so much color and attention to detail, the atmosphere is fantastic and there's a lot of variety in the areas you'll be visiting, from the lush green forests of Myrtana, the face melting heat from the deserts of Varant to the cold snowy areas of Nordmar. The animation quality is kind of mixed, when it works, it's pretty good but for the most part it all feels a little stiff, and weird and a bit awkward, and speaking of weird and awkward, the modeling, especially with the characters is just terrible; it's really obvious when you see all the main characters from the first two games in this one at the very beginning, it seems like the art style from the previous games stayed while the graphics have improved, everyone looks really terrifying. But as a whole, the game looks really good, for the most part. It's worth mentioning the soundtrack because I think it's easily the best thing about this game, holy ♥♥♥♥, by far the best soundtrack in the entire series and it's such a shame it's in this game of all things, it really deserves better than this because it's a perfect example of how you do orchestral music right, it's beautiful and I can easily start tearing up just from listening to it, it's that good.\n\nNow, onto the gameplay, oh shit♥♥♥♥ almighty what a mess this is. Let's start off with the things I liked, the biggest being the faction system. At the start of the game you can choose between joining the orcs or the rebels and the more quests you do for a certain faction the higher your reputation gets, the higher your reputation gets, the more the faction likes you and other factions might despise you for it, it's a system that works really well and it's more consequences to your actions, it also gives the game a lot more replay value, unfortunately though the game is so frustrating that the replay value kind of dies off. Another thing I like is the liberation system, if you choose the rebels' side, when you go to a town that belongs to the orcs, you can decide to liberate it whenever you want, essentially having to kill everyone inside until the orcs decide to retreat and the town afterwards belongs to the rebels, it's really cool and very satisfying when you finally pull it off.\n\nNow, onto the ♥♥♥♥ of the game: the quests are very bland, there's a LOT of content in this game but most of it is very MMO-like quests, get me X amount of this, go kill that, it's not particularly interesting but it's nice how it ties into the faction system I mentioned earlier. My biggest issue with the game and what made me scream in pure rage countless times was the combat system, what the ♥♥♥♥ were they thinking? You know that fantastic combat system from the previous games? How it's very timing based and punishes you for treating it like a hack n' slash? WELL GUESS WHAT, GOTHIC 3'S A ♥♥♥♥ING HACK N' SLASH! And not the good kind, like spectacle fighters, no I'm talking about repeatedly mashing the same button over and over again until something dies. It took me a lot of time to realize this and get used to it. I initially tried playing it like the previous games but found myself constantly dying but then it clicked for me, I figured out that you have to constantly mash the same button to get your enemy in a chain stun and not give them a chance to hit you, because the moment they do, you have no idea whether you’re going to live or die, the animations for the enemies' attacks are way too fast, so you can never react to it in time and it also means that the enemies can get you stuck in a chain stun and you often don't survive it. The combat system is actually not so bad when fighting humans or orcs, but it's a complete mess against monsters or animals. At the very beginning of the game you take out countless orcs, but walk out a few meters outside Ardea and you'll get your ♥♥♥ handed to you by a single wolf, it's broken beyond repair. And it’s not like the previous games where you slowly build up to becoming the ultimate badass, no, you’re pretty much the same throughout the whole thing. I do however like how there's a variety of attacks, though you’ll mostly be spamming the same button over and over again so it doesn't matter, there's also a huge variety of weapons, you have single handed, two handed, dual-wielding weapons along with ranged stuff like bows and crossbows, but it doesn't help when the meat of the game is so horribly broken. But the biggest issue is that the outcome of battle is completely random, one time you can take out a pack of orcs without a scratch and other times you get chain stunned by a Scavanger, as a result I had to quicksave before every single fight because who knows what'll happen? That leads me to the loading times. Every time you die, you have to reload your save AND MY GOD, the load times are horrendous, every single loading screen takes about half a minute, and that might not seem like a lot but it builds up, every time you boot the game up, every time you die, which happens often because of the game's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and it's just aggravating. The game wouldn't be as frustrating if the loading times were shorter, because dying meant I'd have to sit through another half a minute of loading.\n\nGothic 3 is a giant mess, even with the community patch, I can't recommend it to anyone. It's cool to play some of it once to see the ambition and potential Piranna Bytes had with this, but it's all so very rushed and broken, it's almost not worth even giving it a look, and that's so unfortunate. I really hope that one day we'll get to see another true Gothic game like the first two, but it feels like after Gothic 3, Piranna Bytes never looked back on it, they moved onto Risen but after the first game they ♥♥♥♥ed it up again.\n\nStill, Gothic 3 is better than Oblivion. I would much prefer to scream in frustration than to be bored to tears.","June 8, 2015","false","46.8"," 15 of 32 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","15","32","0","0"

The first game I've ever hyped and the first game to utterly dissapoint me.\n\nThe story is much weaker than the previous games and makes little sense - basically, there are only about 4 main quests that drive the plot and the rest of the game are sidequests. The endings are horrible and there's a lot of plotholes. Dialogues are weak as well, the characters from the older games went OOC and you have barely any interaction with them, much unlike Gothic 1 and 2. Some earlier characters somehow appear in Gothic 3 either without any explanation or when they have no reason to.\n\nThe world is big, but the lack of interesting places and general emptyness makes it boring. Towns are pretty detailed, but they're small and seem to be copypasted. The houses mostly look like makeshift shacks, which is really weird comparing to Khorinis. NPC's are cloned and ugly, even the Nameless Hero's friends. Armor and clothing lack variety.\n\nCombat is atrocious - click your enemy to death. No tactics, stunlock galore, horrible animations which don't even change when you level up your combat skills. Magic is pretty useless. The word "balance" does not exist in Gothic 3.\n\nPeople say that the music is the best thing in the game. I disagree. Though it does sound good, it really wears out and gets repetitive quick. Vista Point and the combat music became so annoying I had to shut off the music. The problem is that putting one track per country isn't a good choice. Khorinis had several tracks according to areas.\n\nThe "gothic" feeling is lost due to silly monster redesigns, almost zero immersion, cartoony graphics and way too "epic" orchestral music.\n\nDespite the effort of the Community Patch Team to make the game playable, it still remains a mess with an engine that works on duct tape and glue. JoWood rushed the game and Pirahna Bytes bit more than they could chew.\n\nFor 10 years since Gothic 3's release, I still pretend that the ship we left on in the end of Gothic 2 is still sailing out there.","April 12","false","67.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

You are dropped off in the middle of a orc invasion with almost no tutorial or guidance.  No "dodge", blocking that only partially works, and no "Game Over, Reload from last saved game?" prompt after you die.  As guessed, after almost two hours of game time on record, I can definitely say that you will not play this game for the combat mechanics.  Some ennemies are ridiculously hard (small green goblins, really?!) and others are ridiculously easy (group of large orcs with axe, large lizards, mantis, birds, lurkers, ...), walk backward and swing your sword should kill 95% of your foes.\n\nOn other fronts, luckily it gets better.  You can go about playing this game in whichever way you want.  You can complete a quest before speaking to quest givers, you can kill the guy you were supposed to rescue, you can make friends or ennemies of different factions, your actions have a true impact on your surrounding world.  The world feels amply big yet filled with nooks to explore and always another chest or plant/flower to pick up after the next road bend.\n\nI've had limited exposure in my time to crafting, having only dealt with Alchemy; be ready to be severly limited in how much you can craft, vials seems to be in limited quantities and required for most potions. Its a good thing you can sleep off your pains and wake up with a full HP bar.\n\nI might have forced myself to play through the game if it wasn't for the constant crashes on reload.  Death will sometime come swiftly and the game crashes every 3 reloads for me.

However, this is a detailed, rich fantasy epic that has been hamstrung by a terrible combat system. Swords waving at nothing, cheap hits from enemies that clearly haven't connected with you and just a feeling of vagueness to the whole affair. Gothic 3 isn't a bad game, but you will struggle to enjoy it when your whole reason for being - killing monsters - is crippled from the start.

The game is actually fun at times, but I wouldn't recommend it because the game is fricken long and there are much better games out there for someone to play first.  I only recommend playing this game if you are out of games to play.\n\nThe problem with Gothic 3 is that the game maker ran out of creative ideas.  They took their old ideas from gothic 1 & 2 and apply to gothic 3 and by doing so makes the game long and repetitive.  You basically do some chores and killing some monsters for every town and every faction to get reputation points until you reach a certain reputation, and you do it again again again again again again again......\n\nThe main story is subpar.  The chores you do are not tied to the main story.  The characters you met in story are shallow comparing to gothic 1 and 2.  The voice acting is boring comparing to gothic 1 and 2.\n\nWhat I liked about gothic 1 back then is the immersion.  When I got into old camp, I really liked the whole atmosphere.  Gothic 1's world had an awesome atmophere, and the game is like a combination of adventure and survival horror.  Gothic 1 made me want to explore more and fed my curiosity about what is gonna happen next.  Gothic 2 is less so.  The world of Gothic 3 is just stupid.  The world is boring.  The atmosphere sucks.  There is hardly dungeon like gothic 1 and 2.  Also there is no point exploring because there is also nothing up in the mountain and underwater.\n\nThe combat system sucks monkey balls.  When you attack, you have to make sure you are on low ground and not high ground because you would swing over monster's head and no hit anything if you are on high ground.  The main character is always under-armored against monsters which kill you easily in horde unless you keep spamming spin moves.  The magic is overpowered.  Once you get mana regeneration, the game is pretty much over.  Archer is under powered.  Basically, the game is not balanced.  Anyone playing this game is forced to play a melee fighter because magic and archery are repetitive, and most of the cool items are for melee path.\n\nAlso it is stupid that the good stuff you get in this game are not from quests but from opening chests which are predetermined.\n\nI spent about 180 hours and I am about half way done.  I actually wasted 50 hours in another game until I found out I don't really like alternative balancing of the community patch, and I had to start all over.  Right now I am about 2/3 done, and I don't feel like finishing it because this game has become repetitive and tedius.  I don't feel like doing any more chores, escorting any more people, delivering any more stuff, and killing any more bandits.\n\nOverall, if you have never played this kind of game, you might enjoy it, but if you have played every open world RPG's and gothic 1 and 2, this game is very underwelming.","December 12, 2015","false","201.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","3"

This is during a pitched battle where you are taking damage, not a controlled setting where the player can learn the controls safely.\n\nThen when you try attacking something, you instead sit down. How do you stand back up? Don't know, it doesn't explain. Is this because of that attack that hit you? Again it's never explained. How do you do anything now that you're sitting on the ground... in the middle of a battle? It doesn't explain, and trying every key on the keyboard and mouse does nothing. Why are you fighting these beings? Once again, you don't know cause nothing's been explained at all.\n\nThe story might be amazing later on.

Just... wow. Gothic series has always had its problems. Sure, it has a cult following and it does have its moments, but for the most part, it's mediocre at best. The dialogue in all 4 games is insufferable, the controls are base, the combat is painful to the point where the way your character handles himself in combat situations is why you fail rather than because you were bested, the quests are confusing and the character animations look like they were done for a highschool project. The main character you play as is just some forgettable average bearded muscle-bound man. He's bland. The end of his description.\n\nI received a quest to kill bandits along the coast. Great, sounds pretty normal, right? No. The area on the map I was pointed to confused me. It made it look like I had to go along the coast but the coast ends into a cave with goblins. Wrong area. So I figure I should swim around. Nope. Okay, backtrack and go inland, maybe there's a path to the edge of the cliff on the coast. Never found it. I get into fights with wolves along the way. They just NON-STOP lunge at me until I die. You have to wait for your hit animation to play out before you can react (Dark Souls...) which leaves you open to attack for a ridiculous amount of time. During that time, they repeat their attacks until you are dead. You have to cheese EVERY ENEMY in the game. There is no strategy to be had. Even when I turned on the Community Patch Alternative AI, it didn't change anything. Blocking became more effective but the claims in the patch notes that it made combat more sensible were false. None of the enemies behaved any differently. I switched back and forth with the AA and it did nothing that made a difference.\n\nIt makes no sense that combat is basically me slamming the left mouse button and my character swishes his sword left and right like a dainty ballerina - some effeminate clown that is afraid of the sword he's wielding. You just move forward slightly, barely swinging the sword over and over. That's combat. It also gets you stuck inside obstacles if you're not careful.\n\nThe game is also insanely unstable. I'm using a machine that can run Watch Dogs in its terribly unstable state on ultra settings with 60 fps and Gothic 3 saw me running at 40 fps with constant drops and hitching. The entire world is exposed so you have to dynamically load static objects, scripts and textures on the move. Every 2-3 minutes of walking leads to a pause for about 3-5 seconds where the game is trying to load the new area. Even when I am walking around a small area, I still get framerate hiccups that make me feel like I'm back on my Dell Dimension 2400.\n\nGothic 2 didn't have these performance problems which means they didn't learn anything between that game and 3. Even Arcania: Gothic 4 has the same performance problems! I had to force Vsync in Gothic 3 and 4. What the hell is going through a game designers head when they decide a game DOESN'T need vsync?...\n\nGothic 3 is unplayable. The story is dumb, the character names make me cringe, the quests make no sense, the performance is upsetting, the combat is painful and the entire experience made me feel like I wasted the $2.49 the game cost on sale when I got it. It's so bad, I feel like I wasted 2 and a half dollars. I feel like this game has put a dent in my mental stability. Do NOT buy this game, it's a dreadful experience. The only positive thing I can say about it is the concept. The idea of being able to go anywhere, talk to anyone, kill anyone, take anything and have real consequences that the player will have to deal with is great. The execution was like watching the Grumpy Cat movie.","January 31, 2015","false","2.4"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

The combat system is one of the worst I've ever seen, bad guys back up constantly and frustratingly with every swing, the best way to engage anyone is to attack them against a wall.  You may see your arrow hit dead center, but don't worry, you didn't hit them.  Potions take a lifetime to drink if you're fighting someone.  If you face two of anything and there is a hill or other obstacle there is a good chance that you should run or at least position yourself in a way that nothing is at your back, as a cheap death may be in your future.  Some chests are completely off limits and important, maybe one of a kind shopkeepers will attack you to the death over touching them with no warning, most others have no consequences for taking their contents, there is no way to tell the difference.  Selling things to shopkeepers is even annoying, I put all the junk I wanted to sell in the window, pressed sell, it instantly gave the guy everything for free.  My first sales experience in Gothic 3.  It was probably my fault, I guess you have to move the coins you want over manually from the shopkeeper, but it was not something that added to the charm of the game after being murdered by a pair of THE WEAKEST OPPONENTS IN THE GAME against a hill in a way that made me unable to swing my sword once.

People say it's the best RPG in the world, even better than Skyrim because it has such an amazing, large and deep world to play with. That may be! Except the combat mechanics are literally the worst I've ever had to endure in a video game. Melee combat is horrific. When you try to block an attack it's 50/50 whether it'll actually block it or not. It's not supposed to be 50/50 - if you block it's supposed to block - but the game is so buggy it doesn't always register. You can't tell when an enemy is going to attack because animations are so stiff and poorly done, so it's almost impossible to know when to block. The enemy, on the other hand, will block all your attacks with total efficiency. If you want to play as a melee character, this leaves you with no choice but to approach an enemy and furiously mash the left mouse button to attack over and over and hope you win, which is 50/50. Quite often the enemy will hit you and make you stumble, putting you in what I call a "death spin" which you can't get out of. This is where the enemy keeps stunning you with each hit, meaning you can't retaliate and eventually die.\n\nFurthermore, the game is buggy as hell. Even with the community patch this game is horrendously buggy. I had to restart 3 or 4 times to get past the first part because after I had killed all the enemies in the little village (by furiously mashing the left mouse button because there's nothing else you can do) because you have to talk to this guy to advance the story afterwards, except when I tried to talk him he just said "talk later". After 3 or 4 restarts he finally talked to me.\n\nArchery is even worse. All you have to do is stand on a spot that breaks the enemy AI (which is basically on any kind of rock or tree stump because the AI is awful) and the enemies will begin slowly walking away from you because they have no way of getting to you. So you can wipe out nests of 100 goblins by standing on a rock, even though under normal circumstances 2 or 3 at once would be a challenge.\n\nI can't recommend this game. It's absolutely awful.","March 16, 2015","false","1.5"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","4","12","3","0"

The game starts off in a huge battle - the sounds of combat are insulting to any person with ears.  The sounds are mostly awful grunts "ooh" "ahh" "ooh" "ting" ting" and combat seems to be all about hitting harder and hitting first leaving almost no intelligent challenge to combat.  While the animation in this game isn't the worst you could ask for the movements of the characters are incredibly awkward and take me out of the game.  If the combat is going to look this awful and be so awkward to control they should've just used a turn based combat system or something.

Looks very strange to swing a spear in the left right slash animation, a spear should have a thrusting animation of it's own. And the weapon hitting doesn't make a sound.\n\nThought I didn't like the game, but I keep returning and wanting to play.\n\nBut now after 32 hours of game play the game is frustrating me, with vague quest descriptions causing me to wander in circles and then alt tabbing out of the game to do a search for how to complete quests, I end up with a black screen and crtl alt delete doesn't work and have to manually shut down after the black screen. Don't waste your time playing this. AVOID at all costs.\n\n\nI'd rate the game 3/10  not a game I'd recommend.

Started with the lackluster tutorial where I walked around smacking down orcs and stealing my neigbors' stuff. Nothing groundbreaking but not really fun. Still, maybe it just starts slow.\n\nHere's the ♥♥♥♥♥. In the middle of the tutorial, attempting to click on a chest and steal my neighbor's stuff, I accidentally clicked on his bed instead. (That's not the problem. That was totally me being clumsy, not the game's fault). My character walks towards the bed, but there's a chest in the way. You'd think he'd path around it, right? No, the dumbass walks up to the interveneing chest then just keeps on walking against it dry humping it for all he's worth.\n\nDoes he eventaully path around it?  NO\nDoes he eventually stop? NO\nIf I mash every key on my keyboard, will it cancel his action and make him stop? NO\nCan I bring up the menu to try and save my game and reload? NO\nNo, he's so damned determined to frotteurize that poor helpless chest that he, and the game with him are blind to the world. Unlike it's crappy older brother though, I CAN Ctrl-ALT-DEL out of the game.\n\nWas it good enough to re-invest that 25 minutes? NO\nIs it likely that the rest of the game is programmed perfectly and I just hit the only game-breaking bug in the whole game 2 minutes in? NO\nAm I willing to play the game in a constant state of paranoia, saving before every action in case this kind of crap is pervasive? NO\n\n\nAm I glad I only spent $5 on the entire (so far completely unplayable) Gothic Series?

Sometimes I wouldn't save in time and would lose some of my gameplay. I didn't care too much, the game was worth the hassle. With the patch, the game runs perfectly and the graphics are overhauled. It still looks good today.\nThe best feature of the game is the fact that you can do everything pretty much as you want, there is no real guidance through the quests and the main story line. Some people find this daunting, but when you get into it you realise it gives you a real opportunity to experience the game world.\nIf you want to get to a specific area, the only thing that stops you is either the enemies are too dangerous or it's a stronghold and the faction that owns it doesn't know or trust you. To get through these blockades you have to either train, sneak, do favours, or find a loophole (i.e. getting into an area by doing a job for a farmer).\nBecause of this, the game has an authentic feel to it. There isn't some unseen force of progression that is compelling things to be driven and world events to happen, it all unfolds in an organic and viewable way.\n\nBonus tip: transform into a bloodfly to zip around quickly from place to place.","August 6, 2014","true","101.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The cutscenes were looking pretty standard for a game of its age, and I was getting pumped to enjoy the $2.50 I spent. When it got to actual user input, however, my input wasn't recognised (standard keyboard/mouse), other than WASD, Enter and Esc, and even then I suffered 3-4 seconds of input lag.

I had no experience of the series, but it drew me in with its atmosphere and skill based sword-and-shield combat.\n\nAs a standalone-experience from the Gothic series I quite enjoyed the game's progression, taking my time to explore the map and liberating towns after raising my level, moving through weaker enemies with ease. At higher levels it feels satisfying to take on a crowd of enemies that you could only barely defeat at the beginning of the game. The game is long but you find yourself traveling around, not getting bored of the same locations. Gaining new skills and abilities in the game is handled exclusively through various tutors thorough the game world, and this system is brilliant in its simplicity.\n\nThe melee combat system consist of strong, slow attacks and weaker but faster attacks mixed with power attacks and thrusts. To get anywhere with using melee weapons rhytm and timing of movements need to be perfect, and after learning the behaviour of the different enemies the combat became my favourite part of the game. I can't really judge the other combat styles however.\n\nAs for negatives, even with the available community patch enemies may sometimes deal unexpectedly high damage out of a sudden, leaving you to continue from your last quicksave. The game's story is also up to the player to piece together, leading to a rather sudden start for the game. The game has crashed for me two or three times during 70+ hours. There is a lot to nickpick about the game, for which if you really want to read about check the negative reviews on steam.\n\nFor a discounted price at least (2,99 € for me) the game is worth a try for anyone interested in trying an interesting RPG classic.\n\n\nEssential:\nCommunity patch & View distance fix\nhttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2671041\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=155304006","March 23","true","77.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It really makes the game irritating to play for more than an hour at a time, and that really isn't a good thing at all. I really hope this gets going. I just unlocked two-handed weapons, and crossbows, hoping that the extra damage would help, but two-handed weapons are so ungodly slow that you literally cannot hit an enemy with them unless you get extremely lucky. The crossbow is nice, but it is also, in some ways, broken. I can shoot enemies from far enough away that they cannot see me, and thus do not attack me...\n\nAt this point, 7.0/10.\n\nIf it doesn't start gaining points soon, it is going to be another title I never complete, and I'll eventually have to give it the thumbs down.\n\nOriginal: Seems pretty decent so far...only played a few hours at this point. I do have beef with the controls, though. This game isn't particularly difficult at this point, at least in terms of the strength of the opponents this early on, but the controls make it way too easy to die against fairly low-ranking mobs.\n\nThe community patch 1.75 is necessary -- game was 100% unplayable before getting that patch. Pre-patch, my character wouldn't even stand up after being knocked down, the mouse did not function -- as in turning the view required either using Q and E, or wildly swinging the mouse back and forth a dozen times before the game realized it existed. Those issues were fixed with the community patch.\n\nAs to my current disappointment with the controls -- really, it is just the combat controls. First thing, it takes this dude about 4 seconds to swing a sword for a power attack, and about two seconds for a regular attack. Even a small child can swing a sword toward an object faster than that. Second, blocking does nothing against mobs, only against opponents who also have weapons. Third, it takes this dude FOREVER to draw a bowstring. I have only shot a bow a couple times, and it ain't that hard. You'd think someone with combat experience could do it faster. Fourth, and last, you can't swing down at something below you if you are on a hill -- essentially, anything that is on a portion of ground where the plane is a foot or two below yours can only be hit with a bow...or probably spells. Only have two spells right now, and neither do damage, so I'm not sure about that.\n\nSo, my call at this point is that it would have been awesome had they made the combat more "realistic," and had the difficulty of the game come through in the intelligence of the enemies, instead of it simply being difficult because the combat controls and physics are somewhat sub-par. Granted, it is a slightly older game, but that isn't a very good excuse. As it is, "tricking" your opponents makes killing them incredibly easy. All you have to do is find an object that they can't climb, which is anything since none of them appear to have the ability to jump, and pelt them with arrows until they die. If they have a bow and are shooting at you, you just have to strafe back and forth as they shoot at you. They never hit you.\n\nI do recommend it at this point, because it seems like it is going to develop into a really good game, but I will always dislike the combat and AI systems.\n\nSo far, 7.5/10","March 29","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/itzeosyo/recommended/39500/","itzeosyo","Mr Nobody","http://steamcommunity.com/id/itzeosyo/","340 products in account","Here we go. Fourth time I played this thing and yet again, despite 100 or so hours pumped in, I can't finish it, mostly because Nordmar is awful to navigate around, but really it's the straw the breaks the camel's back for me, cause the whole game is a mess.\n\n- The world is HUGE, and it looks great all around, but filled with mostly nothing. This game doesn't reward exploring. You can explore, sure, but there just isn't actual ♥♥♥♥ to do, no secrets to be found, no challenges that award you with powerful artefacts, no, you mostly kill ♥♥♥♥ in caves and open these special chests which don't award anything even remotely useful until you've opened at least like 25 of them because:\n\n- The loot system is garbage. You can forge one of the best weapons in the game within the first hour of gameplay, and you won't get your hands on anything better until 80 hours later, even then it's nothing significantly better or even better looking. That should say enough, but here's a special mention: there is a very difficult series of quests to forge the best weapon in the game, I will say it right now, DO NOT bother with it. You have to do so much crap to be able to forge a sword marginally better than the one I mentioned above, and it looks AWFUL. So much effort for something that looks like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The weapon you get literally looks like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in sword form holy crap who designed that ♥♥♥♥?\n\n- The quest system is awful. It's so much like an MMO after a while. Go to town, solve easy generic quests, gain reputation, experience, and pointless generic rewards, move to next town and repeat. That's the downside to having a huge world, having to fill it up, and there's no way you can make all the quests be interesting and whatnot then.\n\n- Character development sucks. 90% of what you see on your character stat page is either broken or practically useless unless for novelty purposes. The most effective way to play, by far, is with a one-handed sword and shield. If you really wanna overkill it, just learn fireball, up your mana pool, and spam the mouse button, you can kill anything that way. Fireball is the only useful spell out of the entire spell book anyway. The stats are also stretched to ♥♥♥♥ to make use of the 60-something levels you gain throughout the game. What I mean to say is that you never get a sense of immediate character progression. A character with 500 strength weilding a 200 damage weapon is only slightly better than one with 250 strength weilding a 110 damage weapon, and that's about a 25 level difference between them.\n\n- Combat system is laughable. Fighting humanoid opponents is okay enough, even enjoyable at times but fighting animals and beasts is ♥♥♥♥ing awful. You will reach a point in your character development where you will be able to kill armies of Orcs and liberate entire towns relatively easily, but boars and wolves will still give you panic attacks. Your carefully timed attacks, blocks, parries and armor mean nothing once they stunlock you and unload 10 hits on you within the span of 3 seconds. You can do nothing then except watch yourself get ♥♥♥♥♥ to death and load a previous savegame with violin music playing to it.\n\n- Badly optimized engine. Game is like 10 years old but it hiccups even on present day system. The loading times in particular are the worst. You're gonna really HATE dying in this game because you have to endure a 2 minute loading screen accompanied by violin music if you do. With how bad the combat system is, you're gonna die a lot in the first part of the game. Saving freezes the game for about 15 seconds so saving often isn't fun either, but you have to do it.\n\n- The soundtrack is actually great and the voice acting isn't that bad either but you'll likely skip it all on your second playthrough if there will be one\n\nThere is a community patch that fixes a lot of bugs but it doesn't improve the bulk of the game. It does greatly lessen the chance of being face-♥♥♥♥ed by boars though, so get it if only for that.\n\nI recommend this game. Why? ♥♥♥♥ knows.","July 15, 2015","true","111.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So I gave up on it and it took me till 2016 to give it another go.\nI have to say if you install the 1.75 "beta" test patch its moreorless bug free to a point that it feels like the game it should have been when it was released.\nThe game has a lot of merits which are sadly lost mostly in time due to its terrible launch, the story is interesting and the content is massive. I was impressed with just how many quests and towns there was.\n\nHowever like every game there was a couple of things that still annoyed me, the usual voice changes (Not as drastic as Forsaken Gods thankfully). Also the rebranding of your friends Gorn is now White so is Vatras, also it felt like Vatras was talking to you like he had only just met you when in reality he sailed in on your ship lol.\n\nBut if we put them minor points aside I think this game is a lot of fun and very much worth buying (If you install the 1.75 patch).\n\nAlthough I still rate Gothic 2 over it, it comes in a close 2nd. 8/10","February 29","true","199.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Finally decided to pick it up last sale as I figured both Skyrim and Witcher 3 are well known for their bugs too. (I needed to console hack Skyrim in order to keep the thief quest line from bugging and resetting). Just like Skyrim needs community patches, so does Gothic 3 and in my experience I had no major issues here like I did with Skyrim.\n\nI also have to say Gothic 3 is a better PC experience out of the box than Skyrim; which needs SkyUI to come close to functioning as a PC game as well as a hotbar addon which none of them worked quite right. Gothic 3 has a hotbar built in so you never need to be bothered by constantly going in and out of menus. For instance, towards the end of my play I'd throw out some ice spears, freeze people, pull out my bow and finish them off, kite away, toss back some healing and mana pots, throw some more ice spears, take out my sword and hack away the rest. In both Skyrim and Witcher series (which are console experience games) you'd be constantly be going in and out of menus to get all of that done. Gothic is a very seamless experience that I really appreciate.\n\nIt's a shame that the game was rushed out of release and never received the polish it deserved. At it's core is a really great game, but there are annoying issues. I think I ran into two instances where voice audio was missing from the dialog and one or two other instances where the dialog was spoken by the wrong person. Also it's pretty annoying that if you've got a sword and shield equipped, then use your pickaxe, that your shield doesn't get re-equiped. Still, I'd take that bug anyday over going in and out of pause menus just for a single fight.\n\nI got over 70hrs of gameplay out of it which is what you'd expect and I really rushed the end of the game. After I learned that the developers moved on to make the Risen series I've just been wanting to finish out the game so I could play a game that they were given the time to finish.","June 27, 2015","true","76.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have been playing this game since 2010. I got it from a pc magazine. This game has its own atmosphere/feel/world and great music. The leveling system is spot on, the quests are interesting and the reputation system makes choices matter. The mage build is a bit grindy at times but a hunter (my personal choise) is amazing. Skin your own prey, get trophies like glands, teeth, claws and much more. The main quest is engaging and makes you want to explore the entire map. By the way, the map is humongous and has its own climate zones. But, I think the combat system is not the best for example fighting a pack of wolves with a sword is the worst idea, you can't block attacks from animals even with a shield. But when you get a bow or get training in crossbows and get one. They are easy to handle. Overall I think if you want to experience the game like it should be experienced you should get the community patch 1.75 it is thanks to the community, that we have a stable game with widescreen options, new smarter A.I. and much more, huge thanks to them.  10/10 from me.","June 28, 2015","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had played the first two in the series and always wanted to finish the story of the nameless hero, but I had heard what a buggy mess Gothic 3 was. I played this on version 1.75.14 of the community patch. Even with the patch and playing on a modern computer, the game still lags. The good news is that when I wasn't hitting those lag spikes, the frame rate was mostly very smooth at high settings. The game was also pretty stable, it only crashed maybe five times the whole time I played, and always when I created a bunch of mayhem in a town. And this was in 120 hours of playing. There were some other noticeable bugs, though. On a couple of occasions, npc's somehow got ten feet in the air, or disappeared under the ground. When sneaking sometimes the camera would switch from my character to a nearby npc and I couldn't get it back. When standing on a boulder to shoot at animals attacking me, they sometimes clipped inside the boulder and actually bit me through the rock from below. And I had to spawn King Rhobar with a console command because he did not appear in his throne room. None of this made the game unplayable, but it's very noticeable after playing much more polished games like Skyrim.\n\nGothic 3 differs from the first two in that it follows the open world model of Elder Scrolls. Personally, I prefer the narrative structure of the first two games to the sandbox approach. There is a story that slowly reveals itself as you travel across Myrtana, and you meet several old friends from the earlier games like Diego, Milten, Lares, Vatras, and Lester. The short of it is, the orcs rule Myrtana, the remaining free human settlements are in the mountains of Nordmar, and the Hashishin rule the desert in Varant. You have the freedom to choose who you want to side with: orcs, humans, Hashishin, nomads. Or you can just ally yourself with your old friend Xardas, who is squirreled away in a tower in the mountains. One thing I've always liked about the Gothic series, similar to Witcher, is that character and plot development is driven by actions and consequences over the abstract concept of good versus evil. That said, the weak narrative structure of Gothic 3 makes it hard to get really invested in the story. I literally only had one meaningful interaction with Xardas in my whole game that lasted all of two minutes. And the ending of the main story was completely underwhelming. No epic final boss battle, just perform a certain task and report back. The End. When you play a game for over a hundred hours, you expect something a little grander.\n\nThe world of Gothic 3 is great. It's huge, and varied, and visually it still looks good nine years after its release. It's also very much alive, with wildlife that behaves like wildlife. They sleep, they hunt, they even leave you alone if you keep your distance or move past them quickly without loitering. Humans and orcs live their daily lives, eating, drinking, reveling. The game has tons of dialogue, and while the voice acting has been criticized, I enjoyed that pretty much everyone you meet in the game actually talks. Characters are believable as well. No black-and-white good or evil like in other games. The orcs are occupiers, but have a complex working relationship with the enslaved humans. They are for the most part noble and honorable. I even came to like them, though ultimately I betrayed them.\n\nPlaying with auto balancing turned on in the community patch version made character development choices much more meaningful. With a limited number of learning points to spend, I made my guy a hunter/fighter with absolutely no magic abilities. He also was skilled as a thief and an alchemist, with a little bit of smithing. This made the game much more enjoyable from a role play aspect, and made it challenging throughout versus having some uber god character at the end. The combat itself was horrible, and I didn't even bother swinging my sword until I finally saved up for some paladin armor. My character's movement and reaction time in melee combat was so slow and clunky that taking on more than one enemy at a time was serious trouble. Even in the later levels, my master duel wield swordsman still had to resort to whittling enemies down with arrows before moving in with his swords.\n\nAll-in-all, I had a lot of fun with Gothic 3, but the bugs, weak narrative, and combat keep it from being great.","July 17, 2015","true","120.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat isn't the best, but I found that it was tolerable after the initial hour of awkwardness. I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of hardcore RPG's, and for the game to be played with the community patch v1.75. Be warned; if you play the game in windowed, the windows cursor will appear in the game and can get annoying for some players. Finally, the draw distance / land streaming could be a lot better, but it's an old game so I think it's tolerable, considering that the game is free of loading screens, allowing you to seamlessly travel from town to town.\n\nMy favourite thing about Gothic 3 is that every item is animated when you use it. You don't just gulp down 5 health potions in an instant, rather you have to stand still and visibly take out a potion to drink from (modern day counterpart would be Dark Souls estus flask usage, though if you drink it via inventory then enemies ignore you. Inventory is real time, but stops all combat; enemies that are targeting you seem to stand in place and wait until you are done). Another interesting thing to note would be that there are lots of choices in the game. Help the orcs or help the rebels, turn in a captured slave or help him escape, etc. Each with its own rewards, from simple gold and xp to unlocking trainers that can teach you special skills, or to acquire unique items.\n\nEvery skill has to be learned from some trainer, such as skinning animals for certain parts, how to smith certain weapons, etc. and these can be taught by doing favours for trainers and then paying for their knowledge provided that you have learning points (gained from levelling up). This leads to some interesting levelling choices, where you can specialise (at least early on) into certain professions, whether you want to craft lots of useful potions or create your own swords (but using them requires other skills, depending on what you craft).\n\nThe biggest thing I've noticed is a lack of a quest marker, as well as easy to read status effects. You'll have to listen to dialogue (thankfully logged in a journal) for clues as to where to find certain things and or what to do for your quest. Every NPC is voiced, though the voice acting becomes fairly bland after a while so it's better to turn on subtitles and skip through boring sentences.\n\nFast travel is a thing, though you'll need to find teleportation runes associated with each town (typically found in the corrosponding town) to be able to teleport freely back to it whenever you want by using it, as it's an actual item that sits in your inventory. The game rewards exploration as well as providing some dungeons that can be quite a challenge to clear.\n\nDefinitely enjoyed / enjoying my time with Gothic 3 and am glad I picked it up for the low-low price of $2 which is a complete bargain.","July 17, 2015","true","87.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It really makes the game irritating to play for more than an hour at a time, and that really isn't a good thing at all. I really hope this gets going. I just unlocked two-handed weapons, and crossbows, hoping that the extra damage would help, but two-handed weapons are so ungodly slow that you literally cannot hit an enemy with them unless you get extremely lucky. The crossbow is nice, but it is also, in some ways, broken. I can shoot enemies from far enough away that they cannot see me, and thus do not attack me...\n\nAt this point, 7.0/10.\n\nIf it doesn't start gaining points soon, it is going to be another title I never complete, and I'll eventually have to give it the thumbs down.\n\nOriginal: Seems pretty decent so far...only played a few hours at this point. I do have beef with the controls, though. This game isn't particularly difficult at this point, at least in terms of the strength of the opponents this early on, but the controls make it way too easy to die against fairly low-ranking mobs.\n\nThe community patch 1.75 is necessary -- game was 100% unplayable before getting that patch. Pre-patch, my character wouldn't even stand up after being knocked down, the mouse did not function -- as in turning the view required either using Q and E, or wildly swinging the mouse back and forth a dozen times before the game realized it existed. Those issues were fixed with the community patch.\n\nAs to my current disappointment with the controls -- really, it is just the combat controls. First thing, it takes this dude about 4 seconds to swing a sword for a power attack, and about two seconds for a regular attack. Even a small child can swing a sword toward an object faster than that. Second, blocking does nothing against mobs, only against opponents who also have weapons. Third, it takes this dude FOREVER to draw a bowstring. I have only shot a bow a couple times, and it ain't that hard. You'd think someone with combat experience could do it faster. Fourth, and last, you can't swing down at something below you if you are on a hill -- essentially, anything that is on a portion of ground where the plane is a foot or two below yours can only be hit with a bow...or probably spells. Only have two spells right now, and neither do damage, so I'm not sure about that.\n\nSo, my call at this point is that it would have been awesome had they made the combat more "realistic," and had the difficulty of the game come through in the intelligence of the enemies, instead of it simply being difficult because the combat controls and physics are somewhat sub-par. Granted, it is a slightly older game, but that isn't a very good excuse. As it is, "tricking" your opponents makes killing them incredibly easy. All you have to do is find an object that they can't climb, which is anything since none of them appear to have the ability to jump, and pelt them with arrows until they die. If they have a bow and are shooting at you, you just have to strafe back and forth as they shoot at you. They never hit you.\n\nI do recommend it at this point, because it seems like it is going to develop into a really good game, but I will always dislike the combat and AI systems.\n\nSo far, 7.5/10","March 29","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
