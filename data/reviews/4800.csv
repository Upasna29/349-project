Never did I expect to stumble on this gem in 2014 and enjoy it as much as I did. I always liked RTS genre with a twist, and what a twist RPG addition is! This is simple, yet brilliantly executed game gives you full creative freedom of an RTS game, but throws in a Hero who can level up and equip items. Seems simple enough, until you get your hero to level 80, who singlehandedly can shift the balance of the battlefield, unless you bring a significant army against him, or shut him down early on. This is an amazing little strategy game which brings novelty and freshness to its gameplay.\nCampaign is really cheesy and cringy, but varied and extremely entertaining. Some magnificent easter eggs to be had there that make you beg developers for a Sequel.\n\nThoroughly enjoyed and well recomended.","December 29, 2014","true","15.1"," 30 of 30 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","30","30","0","0"

The campaign wasn't that good, the gameplay is a bit slow. But in the end, it's pretty innovative and I love the variety of all four playable factions.\n\nThere's also a huge mod for the game that should still be in circulation but I haven't looked into it recently myself.\n\nAs for all the reviews saying that the game does not work with machines over 2GB RAM; that issue has apparently been resolved as I learned just today. Game seems to work flawlessly for me now!\n\nA side note: Elhant (the campaign's protagonist) really is a prick. Really.

Though the campaign story writing is cheesy and corny to an extreme, it is at least voiced by somewhat professional English-speaking actors. And though the writing is silly, the actual mechanics of the campaign were designed by an obviously smart and thoughtful team of people (even if English wasn't their first language...).\n\nI've honestly never had as much drive in an RTS campaign to finish each mission as I've had in this game. The scenarios are very challenging and may require some reloads, but none of them (so far) are broken or impossible. The game rewards micromanaging but also overall strategy, and the units, damage types, spells, and technologies are very well thought out and designed. The game had bad PR, a questionable name, a foreign developer, and some strange design choices, but it was clearly made by hardcore gamers with a deep understanding of RTS mechanics and an exceedingly creative spirit. This is the last (and probably the best) game in the strange and exotic Cossacks series from long ago.\n\nAdd to this the fact that this game's graphics are easily some of the best ever from the mid 2000's era, and I was very impressed with the look and feel and how well it aged, even though I tend to be a graphics snob. The sheer wealth of fantasy creatures, all of which look pretty awesome even by Windows 7, 2015 standards, is amazing for a game this old.\n\nThe game has flaws for sure and a few bugs occured during the campaign, but basically, it's a ridiculously good buy for the content you get (expect about 20 h for the solo campaign), and is a great blast from the past if you're in a nostalgic mood. It is a tragedy the game's developers are now mostly defunct, though I do believe there is a community out there who still appreciates this game.\n\nPlease message or friend me if you are interested in doing some multiplayer skirmish games. I'm trying to put together a group that is willing to play on the occasional evening, because, even though the AI seems somewhat competent even on Normal, the sheer wealth of this game's units and spell strategies are best suited for the discerning mind of a human player.\n\nCheers, and I hope this helped!","February 18, 2015","true","16.8"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/milesofbaloney/recommended/4800/","milesofbaloney","Мilo of Lombardy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/milesofbaloney/","80 products in account","I initially thought to review this game perhaps after a dozen hours of gameplay at least, but I later found myself with a list of pros and cons written down in my head and felt it was right and reasonable to do it now. (at the moment I've played as little as 130 minutes). The reasons why I'm spending time to write this review are:\n\n1. There are only 95 reviews, not enough. The community looks small and I'd never heard of this game myself despite loving RTS games with all my heart\n2. As mentioned, I'm an RTS vidya aficionado. I have a lot of experience with such games and I love to be able to post a semi-technical review for once in my life, comparing everything that was done in the past to this 'modern' game.\n\nFirst off, let me tell you my background with RTS games and similar genres mostly comes from countless nights playing Age of Empires II - so when I think of any real-time strategic game that's my anchor. If you don't like the whole base-building sub-genre (i.e. you strongly prefer RTS's like Warhammer or Company of Heroes where the focus is on point-capturing etc) don't consider the rest of this review at all; thanks God HOAE is a base-building RTS.\n\nBack to the point, I can list several more RTS's I've played:\n\n-The aforementioned Warhammer and Company of Heroes series (respectively dawn of war and the first title)\n-All age of empires titles (including AoM), but the first game. I was too young at that time and never found the classical age inspiring anyway\n-Warcraft III\n-The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II\n-Grey Goo (very recent, few may know it)\n-Command and Conquers III\n-Imperivm (European game, not known at all)\n\nNon-RTS but still strategic games that have inspired me, and of which features were often present in many RTS games too:\n\n-Total War series\n-Heroes of Might and Magic III\n-Others I can't think of\n\nI know this whole wall of text might seem pointless or that I may sound like I'm bragging about my collection of strategic games, but it's quite the opposite, I'm simply trying to give a reference to anyone reading so that he or she can understand my point of view and pros/cons. Enough, let's start:\n\nPROS\n\n+Nice unit design in general -- Many units are well drawn, a handful are somewhat original.\n+Good classic base-building -- Again, this is my POV. I've played so many annoying RTS's that focused on capturing resource points and lacked the building side to the point of forcing everyone to play in what we all call 'rushing'. You can't turtle in, you ♥♥♥♥ing can't in games like Company of Heroes. If you pick just 2 or 3 points you're doomed.\n+Diversity between factions -- As with most 3/4-factions modern RTS's, all buildings and units are designed differently for each faction. I think however that GSC did a good job because most units have no real counterpart in the other races' respective armies. (e.g. a race having a few and expensive elite infantry units whilst its opponent has massed and cheap ones with relatively identical stats, and thus taking the same niche)\n+Nice soundtrack, not as good as the OST found in many old RTS games, but very much decent and above average\n+Excellent damage/defence system -- I liked this one quite a lot. Most games, even Age of Empires to an extent, ignore altogether technical mechanics like the type of damage a unit does. For instance, in AoE we get only 3 types: melee, missile and siege damage. Here, there's crushing, piercing and chopping or something, as well as magic damage. Every unit has its own damage type and natural resistance to a few other types. This detail makes battles much more strategic, as you have to consider what type of damage is most used by your enemy's forces and so on...\n+Many unit specific upgrades -- Every unit has several improvements pertaining its damage and defence, some upgrades related to all faction units are present too\n\nCONS\n\n-No Age-up --Basically, the most common of all features, one that usually makes RTS games last ages, was totally ignored. Here the only thing that limits your civilisation/race's progress are a few locked end-game buildings that require you to build unrelated and cheaper ones in order to be able to construct them too. Pretty disappointing, even the aforementioned Grey Goo lacked this wonderful feature.\n-No huge unit diversity WITHIN the faction --yeah you heard that right, I have applauded the developers/designers for making diverse unit sets between each faction, and now I whine because there's no diversity within the races themselves. I'm afraid I have to. If what I said above was indeed true, on the other hand they went too extreme with this originality, and forgot to implement a handful of units I would say are a must regardless how original a faction may be. Example: I've played almost exclusively as the Cryo race (some reclusive northmen with a taste for ice magic and many ancient alliances with beings who inhabit the tundras of all fantasy and mythologic settings), and they lack any kind of cavalry AND missile unit. All they have is a diverse array of slow uberbeings (yetis, giants, golems, mammoths) who deal melee -and almost exclusively of crushing type- damage. I understand it could of been for the sake of originality, but to this point? All I have for a ranged unit is either a spellcaster or a ballista. Seeing as all peons use bows, it is implied this society of northmen has a tradition of bow hunting of some sort, which is already implied by the mere fact of living in a ♥♥♥♥ing frozen land in the far north.\n-Lame lack of unit-voicing --It bothers me so much that they don't say anything when clicked, dragged, ordered to attack, etc. Any RTS I've played had it, even Grey Goo... So why the ♥♥♥♥ not GSC?\n-No unit-specific evolution-like upgrade --I'm so used to unit transformation and evolution too, and I can't feel satisfied with a bunch of armour and weapon upgrades. Like, even in HOMM there are unit upgrades, people love to see their 'whatever' transformed into 'lord whatever elite' with its stats multiplied by 3 for a nasty sum of resources. Again, a very common feature seen even in RTS games like Company of Heroes (the veteran upgrade or something), overlooked by GSC.\n-Bad pathing of certain units --no further explanation is needed, you'll see it.\n-Some elite units are too much limited in numbers --Most high power units can only be trained once per building type. It's like if you build some barracks the construction houses 10 pikemen and that's the maximum you can have. To train more, you're forced to set up a row of identical buildings. I understand the building limit per se, but perhaps some upgrades or an 'expand building' feature also present in other stuff would of been more reasonable... One ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mammoth per building is too much to bear...\n-Odd design choices in a few things --Like the Cryo heroes being all human but of different ethnicity. Others might think it's fine, but to me it makes no sense to have the Mage look like some caucasian bearded all man, the Warrior like an average Inuit fisherman and the Ranger a female east asian teenager. On the other hand, whilst this faction has weirdly designed heroes, and is somewhat original per se, typical faction/races present in all fantasy games, novels, films whatever are totally absent (e.g. humans, orcs, gnomes, trolls). Many neutral races are indeed present but only work as a source of income and artifacts (slaughter them) or as mercenaries; most of those would have actually been a wonderful addition to the small list of playable civilisations.\n-Unit healing, lastly --yeah I don't know for other factions, but to heal my units with the Cryo I have to cast a spell repeteadly from my Temple or something, and that heals some 10% of all of my units... Pretty crappy and relatively expensive. Also, non-living units seem unrepairable, some have stated. Certain elementals like Ice golems and spirits self-regenerate.","October 5, 2015","true","2.2"," 28 of 36 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","28","36","3","4"

Don't let my hours fool you, I've played this since release. I saw it here and I wanted it on my Steam for a computer that the original disk won't work with so I bought it again here. I literally probably easily have 300-400 hours in this one, if not more, as I've played it at least weekly since 2006.\n\nThe campaign is ok, can be difficult but it is good for teaching you about the heroes and the units. I play the skirmishes. I never get tired of it. Sometimes I'll give myself an AI teammate and go against 3-5 AI teamed together or any of a million set ups I've tried over the years. There's still a couple of bugs but they aren't bugs so much as exploits which you'll probably never find anyway. Some AI pathing issues mainly with the dwarf constructs and the frost guys mammoth. I love that there are npc monster huts that you can hire and they auto send groups of troops out fighting. I was so disappointed that they never made a Part 2 or added more to this one but I still play it at least once a week, it's a nice break from my intense longer games.\n\nI hope they sell a few copies here and decide it's worth doing another.","November 13, 2014","true","121.9"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","0"

Beign a gsg game it's not uncommon to see hundreds of units on the battlefield, and theres a certain satisfaction in destroying them, having their ranks break down, see them driven before you and hear the lamentation of their women.\n\nGraphics are top notch, for a 2d game, they're amazing, and even all those years they still look like a fairytale, couldn't say the same if it was 3d.\n\nMultiplayer still works after all those years, with gamespy being down, it's a privilege to be able to get multiplayer to work wihtout having to tinker with hamachi, tunngle or gamespy.\n\nThere's a hero RPG system "borrowed" from warcraft 3, it takes 20 minutes until the cooldown ends and you can use him, they're really weak early on, but when you get them rolling? They become small superweapons.\nThere isn't an 18 lvl cap like in, say, wc3, so you can get real high with the hero and wreak total havoc, especially with the proper skills & an army (that you got rolling while he was out of it) worthy of the title.\n\nAll in all, pretty good, worth trying out, at least because it's one of a kind (despite the generic setting).","February 12","true","5.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","11","11","2","0"

If you enjoy RTS games with an RPG hero type then this is something you'd love. This is basically taking the concept of Spellforce and bringing it to a new game. Extremely well done, the story is very well written.  Through out the game there are numerous modern day wrecks oddly. As this is a fantasy game finding a wrecked tank or a crashed jet plane is not the sort of thing one expects to find. This was planned to be chapter 1 of 3 but because sales were lacking the project was scrapped sadly. I highly recommend playing the campaign though. Very good story that sucks you in.

They created an interesting plot-hook.. but never followed through. This was, apparently, planned as a trilogy and they went bankrupt after publishing the first part.\n\nThe RPG-part of this game is collecting loot and leveling up your character (one Character but 3 paths to follow: Mage, Ranger and Warrior).  With every level that you advance you can choose to increase a statistic (no skill), like damage, movement speed or the likes. If you don't like the two opportunities, you can choose to wait this time but the next level up you will get a far greater range of changes. The system I liked but that's it for RPG, because the quests are all: Go and kill something for reasons! Get Coins or Loot as reward! Just clearing out the entire map is more fun because of all the hidden stuff you can find(special gear, potions that give permanent changes to statistics).\nAt about two occassions (might even be three), you can control a second hero character. I gave her all the stuff I didn't need and never played her again after that.\n\nThe RTS is like in Spellforce but only with one race and a bit more clumsy. The resources are placed sometimes a bit random but luckily, you don't have to play this to often. In my playthrough I had to build a base on maybe 4 or 5 occassions.\n\nIf you are thinking about buying the game because of the story, don't do it, there is none besides the usual "Find magic artifact that saves the world" and everything else is just decoration.\nIf you are looking for a game similar to spellforce .. buy spellforce, because this game is too limited in this regard.\n\n___\nGot hooked on the story but it never evolved. Gameplay is "meh" at best and tedious at worst. Difficulty on normals was at the second half of the game non-existent (played as a mage character).\n___\n\nRackhim","August 2, 2015","false","16.7"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

If I had to list the purchases I regret the most on Steam, this would probably be placed very high up on the list.\n\nThe developers clearly thought they couldn't mess up RPG and RTS, then learned the hard way that real-time strategy isn't an easy genre to develop for at all. The game is unfinished to a sometimes hilarious extent, and it ends in a cliffhanger that was never ever continued because losses were up the roof and the planned trilogy was dropped.\n\nThe first few chapters can fool you, but the truth is, there was never any planning done for chapters past four. Usually, you get swarmed by a horde of enemies right as the chapter starts, a battle in which you lose your pre-deployed army and have to spend the rest of the mission endlessly microing your hero back and forth trying to get somewhere. "Thousands-strong armies"? For your enemies, maybe. Not for you.\n\nSpeaking of the hero, Elhant is one of the most uncooperative, arrogant ♥♥♥♥♥♥ I have ever seen in a protagonist role, and I spent the entire game wishing he'd die a horrible death. Not that I saw half of what you're supposed to see of him, because the movie cutscenes wouldn't load on my PC. For a while, I went into the game folder to watch them, but then I realized the loading bug was probably for the best.\n\nAnd yes, to top it all off, the game is filled with bugs. It's funny when they allow you to kill a boss by shooting them from behind a wall - I did that several times while I grabbed a snack - but it's not so funny when the AI takes a ridiculous path or the game simply crashes mid-mission.\n\nNever mind the massive feature list shown on the Steam Store Page, most of it is broken, unfinished, or simply not as good as you'd expect. Now, I've heard multiplayer used to be rather decent, but as expected from a 2006 game, it is now dead. Do yourself a favor, do not buy HoAE. There are far, far better strategy games on Steam.","January 13, 2014","false","14.4"," 54 of 120 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","54","120","0","0"

The races are... limited, but hey, the maps are pretty-..uh, limited as well. Well the campaign is.. well actually, the campaign is pretty cool. But once you finish the campaign, there isn't much left to this game. Well there IS that map pack and the sol race addon, but it's NOT ON STEAM TO BUY. What a shame, this game could have used a few more maps and races. At least a human race, or some sort of bug race. What about those modern airplanes in the trailer? Wasn't this suppost to be Fantasy meets Modern Tech? This game is dissapointing, but fun because of cheats. Without cheats is pretty fun, but nothing beats using cheats on the first level of the campaign. Hordes of undead, a path that leads to the city and out? That's some attack/defence stuff if you cheat towers in and extra men to fight back the undead. Aaaand that's where this game's fun ends. At least update it through steam every now and then!","July 28, 2015","false","174.0"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","7","22","0","2"

It tries the same thing as Warlords Battlecry and Warcraft 3 did before it by adding RPG elements to it. I want to love the game, but it has to many problems to recommend it. The game looks cool because of it's great artstyle. The campaign is on "normal" gamespeed and this is way too slow. I couldn't find a way to put the gamespeed on "fast". And of course it has a cheesy story and the main character is very unlikeable. The multiplayer mode is better you can put the gamespeed on "fast", but the AI isn't very challenging so you need some friends to enjoy the game after defeating it.\n\nThe game tries a weird RPG vs RTS mode in multiplayer where you can chose to only play with your hero or go in RTS mode where your hero is deactivated for 30 minutes. You can chose in the options for only using only the RTS mode. In RTS mode the gameplay is very macro oriented and is basically build a better economy and send a bigger army to the enemy. There isn't much use to microing your army. The way of casting spells is horrible and the whole RPG UI is bad. If you have friends who want to play this game it could be pretty cool, but I wouldn't recommend it for the singleplayer or skirmish against the AI.","May 8, 2014","false","3.7"," 15 of 45 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","15","45","0","0"

Hilariously, (or not) the fortification defences tend to fire just once every 10 seconds, meaning you *have* to maintain a sizeable standing army at all times, just to ensure you don't get wiped out in the first 10 minutes.\n\nPossibly if the developers had spent as much time on QA playtesting, as they did on the grphics, this game could have been quite good.\n\n2 out of 5*.

You do need to think whilst playing the single player missions as you will be sorely outnumbered and cannot expect to smash your way through enemies.\n\nThere is also an element of the use of magic in this game and believe me, you will need it.  You can purchase a magic spell( or card in this game) and choose which spells you wish to delpoy.\n\nYou can build your character as with other games but there is really not much of a class system  in this game, you can fight with a bow and magic or with a sword and magic. However you can choose to increase your damage/movement spedd/attack rate/health & mana regeneration to customerise your character.\nLike with other RGP games, you can buy armour and weapons for your charatacter and you will find artifcat masters and indeed alchemists for your potion needs dotted around the map.\n\nSpeaking of maps, these are fairly big and rather like a maze,sometimes you do no know what will be awaiting around the corner, whether you get a small mini quest, another ally or more monsters.\n\nAfter you complete a mission you get a comic book cut scene, I say that becuase it is like flipping throught a comic book but it is very well done.\n\nI would really love to see a sequel! For the amount that I paid for it, spending 37 hours in a game is a bargain.\n\nI would rate this 8/10","January 25, 2015","true","40.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
