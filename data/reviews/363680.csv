And while many may argue about the implementation, and the balance, the majority of players agree that it is fun.\nOne challenge new players might have is the different factions. Remember that each faction has it's strengths and weaknesses, which means each faction has different play-styles that fit them. You will need to learn how to play each faction that you wish to use, and you will lose some battles in that learning process. Be patient, learn, and remember: sometimes a faction just might not fit your play-style.\nThe only problem I have with the game is that sometimes, it's easy to forget that you're commanding ships that are miles long. these are not small vessels. yet there's so much going on so often that you just don't have the time to zoom in and enjoy watching your space cathedral floating along.","April 21","true","64.0"," 290 of 331 people (88%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","88","290","331","13","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Space_Owl/recommended/363680/","Space_Owl","Space_Chefke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Space_Owl/","531 products in account","Before starting the review, I want to get two points out of the way that those giving this game a negative review usually complain about:\n\nDifficulty\nThe game isn't that hard, simple. The problem is not the difficulty, but the players themselves. Too many are playing this game on the highest difficulties when this is their first time playing a game such as this one. Not just that, but this game had in mind an old school difficulty, where hard REALLY is hard unlike most of the games nowadays. Easy and Normal modes are there for a reason, for you to use if you struggle. For you, to IMPROVE. Many on the forums and the reviews are spoiled by gaming nowadays, they want it all and they want it NOW.\n\nThey don't want to spend hours to learn and improve their skills, and that's the issue. And the beauty of this game is the fact that in the campaign, even if you lose a battle, is not game over. You obtain XP and rewards and you can still overcome whatever the game throws at you.\n\nMicromanagement\nSeriously? Most of the time playing this game you control a bunch of ships, usually at the beginning a mix of 1-2 "big" ships and a couple smaller ones. Is micromanagement really a problem in an RTS that is about commanding a bunch of ships? If you think so, then you haven't played that many RTS's. Hell, you even have a "slowmo" button that you can use as much as you want to give quick orders if you can't keep up with what's going on. Not just that, but you can set the skills of the ships to auto, so you don't have to worry about it.\n\nWith that said, I want to mention that I wasn't trying to sound arrogant. I'm not a "PRO-MLG", I'm not a great RTS player, but that's how I feel right now reading many of the threads and reviews. Those points (IMO) aren't valid to give this game a negative review.\n\nNow the review, I'll try to summarize everything and expose my biggest complains at the end of the review.\n\nReview\nNow that those points are out of the way, let's talk about the game. If you had always that itch for a W40K RTS based on space ships, then this is your game. Even if you are not a W40K fan, you are more than welcome although the universe of W40K is one of the reasons that makes this game so special (IMO).\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is very simple, you have an "armada" (duh) under your command and you have to use it wisely in order to be victorious. Like any RTS, you give them direct orders. Most of the ships have skills, that if used correctly, can be the difference between victory and defeat. There's different types of victory or "modes". Sometimes you have to defend a point, others "grab" some info from an enemy ship. Overall they aren't ground breaking but are good enough to keep the game "fresh".\n\nYou can choose your ships, modify them with new skills, upgrades and you can even upgrade your crew. Each ship has a weakness, so don't ever think that a big ship can assure your victory. And each one has a role, one type of ship is better at CQC, others at long range. Is pretty simple in theory yet complex enough to allow players to create a unique armada that fits their playstyle.\n\nGame Modes\nThere's 3 game modes, Campaign, in which you command an Imperium fleet in a "risk" style map. If you have played games like DoW1 Soulstorm, is more or less like that although more scripted at the beginning.  You can choose your fleet, upgrade it, and "customize" it to fit your needs. It has some great voice acting and perfectly recreates that W40K feeling.  And the best thing, like I mentioned before, is the fact that a failure doesn't equal game over. If you fail in a mission, things may get tougher but you move on. Giving some replayability, and best of all, you will never get "stuck". There's always a way to be victorious even if things get tough or don't look so good, however, that doesn't apply if you are always defeated (The logic is strong on this one yet many miss it).\n\nSkirmish vs AI. No comments, the name says it all. Although it has a rank system like the campaign and MP.\n\nMultiplayer, that needs some serious tweaking.  It has some balance issues, and the matchmaking and servers need to be polished. It uses a rank system like the SP modes, in which you start with the lowest tier of ships and you have to "grind" your way up. It sounds nice, if it wasn't for the fact that matchmaking is kinda broken and it can match you with a guy who has way stronger ships. If you want to play this game for the MP, wait for it.\n\nTech and Sound\nThe game looks nice and clean, most of the time. The graphics aren't that great, and the game has some bugs related to the graphic options. In fact, I have a few complains that I will talk about later. The design and style of the ships though, is superb. They perfectly recreated the ships, and everything fits perfectly. The ships are canon, and that's the biggest plus (If you are a fan of W40K).\n\nThe AI is one of the strongest points in this game.It is very competent, sometimes it feels like playing against a human. They will always try to win, never stay passive. It will make very logic decisions (Most of the time) and use every tool at its disposal to defeat you. I.e. a battle with the AI is never a walk in the park, although on the lowest difficulties they won't react that quick nor use skills that much.\n\nPersonally, I have no complains about the sound effects. They do their job, but sometimes they bug and you hear nothing. The quality is there though, and with a 7.1 headphones you can perfectly feel the "kick" of an explosion. The soundtrack is average, not in a bad way. It's nothing extraordinary, but that's mostly because of the universe of the game. It adds to the immersion, it is very "W40Kish" but too similar to the soundtrack of other W40K games.\n\nComplains\nFirst and foremost,  Unbalanced game modes.  Basically a couple game modes need some tweaking. Depending on what faction you are up against, they can be really frustrating, unless you get really lucky. I think the devs didn't spend enough time playing these game modes before releasing the final game (As far as I know, they added most of them with the 1.0, so people couldn't test them back when the game was in Early Access). In my opinion, Planetary Assault and Data Recovery are the ones that need some tweaking.\n\nNext, the multiplayer. Again, nothing that I haven't said before. Unbalanced and has a horrendous matchmaking.\n\nSURPRISE bugs... Yeah, this game it's been in EA for a long time and from what I read from the forums, there still bugs that have never been addressed. In my experience, so far, I haven't had experienced that many bugs, but I have to mention it because there's a good number of complains and I can understand that. I may be lucky, but others aren't so. Personally, I've experienced sound bugs and a couple times I lost my mouse cursor, but could be worse.\n\n(Personal complain) The campaign, not the campaign itself but the wasted opportunity. I'm sick and tired of always playing as the Imperium, simple. I think they just wasted a great opportunity of making a campaign like DoW, allowing players to pick their favourite race giving the game almost unlimited replayability. Like I mentioned before, the campaign itself is great, with a perfect atmosphere and top notch voice acting, but a change would be most welcome, specially when most W40K games focus on the Imperium.\n\nI.e. wait for it to get patched and properly balanced, the game is really good and it has a promising future but right now, it needs to be polished a bit more to become a true gem. If you want to focus on the MP, just wait a couple months and come back.\n\nEdit: I've updated the review after beating the main campaign on HARD. Again, it is not impossible as many like to claim.","April 23","true","29.6"," 256 of 291 people (88%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","88","256","291","11","32"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/very_serious/recommended/363680/","very_serious","renoraider","http://steamcommunity.com/id/very_serious/","37 products in account","This review will be constantly updated so please provide comment and feedback if you wish to add your own experience or correct me on certain details. Thanks in advance!\nPros:\n* Authentic-looking, kilometers-long, badassfully manly space churches\n* Immersive and destructive space battles\n* Free DLC once for early adopters\n* Customizeable ships (aethetics/appearance, abilities, skills, upgrades and crew)\n* Gripping prologue and characters with excellent storytelling and voiceovers.\n* Constant flow of events in battles require second-by-second change in tactics and inevitably develop ships and captains with their own colorful history.\n* Responsive devs (hoping this will continue since this WILL BE a crucial selling point)\n* Satisfying AI and control layout (shortcuts, pathfinding, auto-activating abilities available, engagement possibilities and tactics)\n* Races (four currently: imperial navy, chaos, ork pirates and eldar corsairs) feel individually unique with potential for personalized warfare.\n* Rewarding combat especially for truly brilliant tactics and strategizing; losing doesn't even feel bad.\n* Great multiplayer potential\n* Campaign holds excellent replayability potential and losing battles does not necessarily mean game over but rather tougher battles in the future.\n* Key points in the game along with accomplishments in certain battles will allow Spire to change the whole course of the 12th Black Crusade and change certain details in the original storyline of the tabletop game lore.\n* Can run with high graphics even on mid-level specs\n* Great price, especially with 10% pre-order discount\n* Fun classic ship-of-the-line battling and tactics: tacking and ramming (in space) amongst other things.\n* Clear sense of multi and singleplayer segregation. Players have separate single and multiplayer fleet profiles that are progressed exclusively from each other. You don't need to be online 24/7.\n\n\nCons:\n* Controls could use some user specialization and customization while some annoying problems occur. Abilities and commands have hotkeys and shortcuts but are not displayed even on tooltips, requires constant returns to the control options menu unless you memorize it all. Minor, but very tiring.\n* Game modes may get repetitive depending on map variety and story content.\n* Ships will blaze through minefields if you have overriding move orders.\n* Current maps are cookie-cutter: space with random asteroid, station and cloud layout and background though this is to be expected, space isn't always necessarily creative.\n* Soundtrack is fine, but nothing memorable so far (personal opinion)\n* Lack of map/scenario editor reduces replayability (devs could've saved some funding since players would've done their job and uploaded new maps, themselves)\n\nYou won't find the word in the title but this is the universe of Warhammer 40000. The only constant is war, compassion is weakness and red things 'go fasta'. You are Captain Spire, the soon-to-be admiral of your own fleet. Danger looms over the endless horizons of space as duty calls for you to lay down your life for your Undying God-Emperor on His Golden Throne. You are but one of many, but yours is a role that will send waves and tremors across the vast reaches of the Gothic Sector. Your crew look to you for orders. They will not find you wanting. They MUST not find you wanting. Welcome to Battlefleet Gothic, admiral.\n\nNow, for an in-depth detailing of pros and cons, I am deep into chapter 4 and have seen enough to give some solid feedback. Take note, however, that their may be a spoiler or to in here. First, characters, scripts, gameplay and storytelling remain outstanding. Cutscenes are used sparingly and, much like the exterminatus you will see in-game, are exacting, powerful, well-timed, grim and very, very, badass. Elements remain true to the grimdark machinations of the Warhammer 40K franchise. Battles can get tiring, but in the way that you must constantly adapt and counter every move your foes may make, lest you suffer crucial losses, or a decisive defeat. Pathfinding could use some fine-tuning, such as ships ramming space debris without care as well as an annoying problem were I can use the 'S' and 'D' keys to scroll across the map but leave the 'W' and 'A' keys unresponsive, though this may or may not be an isolated problem.\n\nWith regards to replayability (possible spoilers) certain game choices will allow you to alter history and deviate from the original warhammer lore. An early point comes whether or not you are able to keep two certain artifacts (mentioned at the beginning cinematic with abaddon) from chaos forces. You can also defy typical Imperial behavior and actually heed an eldar's warning. Then again, it is entirely up to you. Take note, that this will have crucial impact on enemy strength and races you go up against. Siding with eldar, for example, will ease their attacks and may stop them entirely.\n\nFor more cons, while game modes remain repetitive, there are enough variation and randomization that it doesn't get all that tiring, though objectives remain boringly linear: keep x from reaching y, go to a, keep b from stealing c, and so on. Ultimately, the battles main selling point is not the end of the journey, but how you get there, namely how you're gonna triumph against enemy fleets whilst keeping yours intact, on the way to accomplishing your objectives. The maps could use some more loving, but it's space, and other than some fancy looking backgrounds, you're not gonna find anything more besides rocks, space debris, and giant space cathedrals.\n\nOn the multiplayer side, most of the campaign experience carries over, save for the lack of a story and general direction. Ultimately the goal is to have fun, pitting yourself against human foes in, at most, 2V2 fights, though that experience in itself may see its own hiccups as automatic match-making can never really gauge tactical skills in order to truly pit a genuine novice against his own breed. You may find yourself fighting a strategy veteran, despite the fact that your levels are the same. In hindsight, though, that should be fun in its own way and trust me, 4 people against each other will be complicated enough. Still here's hoping for bigger fights, bigger maps, and even more ships in the future.\n\nSo, final thoughts, the game is spectacular considering its price, and while the campaign is as well told and as manly as they come, BGA's real attraction lies in human player pitted against human player. I honestly think you'll be spending the majority of your time in the multiplayer lobby while the campaigns potential for replays offers a substantial distraction. Progression in both multiplayer, random skirmish and campaign is linear, with branching elements restricted to individual ship specialty (maneuverability, firepower, etc.) with corresponding choices in terms of crew and upgrade loadout and distribution. And the real question: is it worth the price tag? By the Emperor, it is. Now if we could just take care of those minor cons.\n\nVerdict: 40K/10 will ram with space cathedrals again.\n\nP.S. The issue of the space marine DLC is in the end a matter of perspective, but comparing it to the fact that the first Dawn of War game had a basic four race selection (Space marines, chaos space marines, orks and eldar) it certainly seems fair enough by my standards. Ultimately, naval engagements are predominantly left to the imperial navy in canon warhammer lore, though that does not necessarily mean the space marines are pushovers (there's a reason they have 'space' in their name), it's just that the imperial navy are the space posterboys and would have a priority in being included first. Again, that's purely my opinion, so perhaps we should just be grateful the space marines WILL be coming soon, and with no extra charge at that, provided you buy the game soon.","April 21","true","37.0"," 264 of 303 people (87%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","87","264","303","51","18"

If you don't know what 40K is or you're one of those insufferable people that demands a video game play exactly like its board-game inspiration, skip this.\n\n\n1] The game oozes 40K. If you like the 40K theme, the developers did a very good job staying true to the source material. Tech priests, commissars, and navigators have voice recordings that feel right. The ships are all very pretty. The developers can recite the Imperial Hymnal, and it shows...\n\n2] There is an amazing amount of depth to upgrading and managing your fleet. Understanding your own play-style is key to doing this well because you simply will not be able to upgrade each ship in your fleet to do everything. Opportunity cost is everywhere.\n\n3] The game makes you feel the impact of your decisions. Fail a mission? You get less reknown for a mission. Reknown is used to upgrade your ships. Choose poorly in upgrading your ships/fleet, you will feel the impact of those choices in upcoming battles. Lose a ship in battle, and you lose access to it for a number of rounds. Although you can recover from any mistakes, it takes time and reknown to correct those mistakes.\n\n4] The game difficulty scales reasonably well, (1-4). On 4, I win about half of the time. On 3, I win about 80% of the time. Easier difficulties and you can feel like a tactical genius. You can play at whatever difficulty suits you.\n\n5] The game is 2D naval combat metaphor, and not 3D space combat. People will whine about this, in a post-Homeworld space RTS world. However, there are enough other things going for this game, that I'm willing to overlook that aspect of the game.\n\n6] The detail and pretty videos you see on YouTube are great... except, I don't really spend any time managing my fleet zoomed in like that. It's a perfect way to lose my battle. In a sad/unfortunate way, so much wonderful detail gets lost/ignored when playing the game.\n\n7] The game runs well on my 6th gen Core i7 with Nvidia 970M gfx, which is saying it runs well on the latest and greatest laptop with discrete gfx. It was barely playable on a laptop that is 3 years old.\n\n[updated review]\n\nI've seen a few complaints from other reviewers that are worth addressing.\n\n8] Reviewers that write, "It's too hard. [faction] is too hard on [mission] types," are not playing correctly. If the Chaos Space Marines are outrunning your Imperial ships in an assassination mission, stop using large and slow capital ships and use light cruisers. If the Orks keep destroying all of your Imperial defense platforms, then properly group your ships into a massive clump concentrate fire on a single ship at a time so that at least one platform survives. If the Eldar keep destroying your fleet, then use light cruisers with lots of frigates. Every complaint about the game being too hard is due to the player not understanding the victory conditions, their ships strengths/weaknesses, or their enemies' strengths/weaknesses.\n\n9] Reviewers that write, "the mission types get boring/repetitive" do have a point. There are only a handful of mission types: cruiser clash, assassination, convoy, breakthrough, and data acquisition. That's a meager 9 basic mission types, when you factor that victory conditions for attackers and defenders are different, and the tactics used to win are often different between attacker/defender. And if you choose to include faction permutations, that's roughly 27 mission types. There's some reasonable diversity there, but I would agree that it could benefit from more single player campaign missions that are scripted. This is something that Warcraft3 and Starcraft2 franchises did and it does make the missions more engaging.","April 22","true","53.3"," 114 of 143 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","114","143","2","0"

It's going to need some big changes to improve, changes I don't see them moving to make. The 2 big problems are micromanagement and grind.\n\nMicro management hell:\n\nIn order to give it the RPG elements that seem mandatory in every game these days, each ship can be upgraded with tons of special abilities, all of which have their own separate hot key and button. It's common to see ships with a DOZEN ability buttons each. Many of these are ridiculously powerful (nova cannon, stasis bomb) and tend to overshadow the basic guns. The game ends up resembling an MMO style ability cooldown management experience rather than a naval maneuvering game. It doesn't feel like you're fighting with ships so much as you're controlling dueling space wizards casting spells. It would be one thing if all these special abilities were limited to support style ships, but EVERY ship gets the SAME "spells". A light cruiser can "cast" the exact same stasis bomb as a battleship.\n\nSpeaking of the upgrades in general, there is no strategy to choosing them because a couple are obviously useless (+5 degrees/sec turn speed when instant turn maneuvering thrusters are already practically free?) while a couple are obviously better (almost any of the damage/gunnery skills). You end up seeing fleet with 90% the same skills (oh hey another stasis bomb).\n\nAll of this is made worse by the default speed being way too fast. WAY too fast to be managing what amounts to controlling 2-6 individual MMO characters. You can activate a "bullet time" mode (tactical cogitators) which effectively pauses the game, but it's jarring having to do this constantly. If you really want to be serious about your micro, you'll rarely let it run at default speed for more than one second at a time, having the announcer scream "TACTICAL COGITATORS ONLINE!" every single time you pause (holy hell will you get sick of hearing that). Pausing is limited in multiplayer, like a chess clock. However this isn't very fair since some races (Eldar) rely a lot more on micro than others.\n\nThe speed also causes large groups of ships to crash into each other constantly. In the tabletop, it assumed the distance between ships in space was big enough that collisions were only possible if one ship was intentionally trying to ram. In this game you're going to have ships constantly bumping off each other like pinballs unless you use your annoying and precious pause time to avoid it.\n\n\nThe grind:\n\nHoly hell the grind. You start off only being able to use a single light cruiser and a couple of the smallest escort ships. It is very boring playing with just these. To unlock more, you must grind battle after battle to gradually earn xp until you're "allowed" to use whatever ships you want in a battle. It's so slow and obnoxious that it feels like a F2P unlock model designed to make you go "screw this" and fork over cash to skip the grind, except this is a full price retail game you already paid for. This unlock model would be fine in the single player campaign which plays out like a long term RPG experience, but for skirmish and multiplayer? Completely unacceptable. It's going to take 10-15 hours to unlock every unit for a race, and you must repeat this for every...single...race. If that wasn't enough, you must repeat the grind again for every...single...difficulty level. Spend 40 hours unlocking everything on normal and want more of a challenge? That will be 40 more hours to unlock everything on hard, please. Totally unacceptable.\n\nThis isn't even getting into the horrible mechanic where fleeing or losing a ship means you cannot use it for X number of battles. Again, this would be fine for the single player campaign but it carries over into skirmish and multiplayer, which is ridiculous. Imagine playing a Warhammer game and having someone take away your models if they die. "You can have them back at the end of the day." Whether it's laziness or insanity, the developers are obsessed with carrying over all the campaign mechanics to the skirmish or multiplayer modes, regardless of how badly it doesn't work. Some insane people will defend it saying, "It gives your ships value!" All it does is promote overly cautious play where people give up at the first sign of losing and run away. Some battles start with players retreating right away because they don't have their good ships and are just trying to "grind" X number of battle to get them back again. Ridiculous.\n\nI realize you can’t make it an RTS and have it be a perfect conversion of the table top game, but they screwed up so many of the core concepts. In the table top, you got ONE special order per turn and had to roll to see if you could carry it out or risk losing control. Many special orders had drawbacks (full speed wouldn’t let you turn, brace for impact cut your firepower in half, etc). It was a risk vs reward setup. In BFG Armada, everything is just a free MMO cooldown ability. All movement is no longer tied to special orders but a stupid boost gauge. There is no drawback to any of the special orders (other than waiting for the cooldown) and the movement stuff is free. Carriers no longer need to use the Reload order between launches and can use just as much extra speed boost as other ships. The result is boring, overly long games of chasing endlessly kiting ships around.\n\nThere’s the whole damage model. In the TT, the chance to hit ships was based on their headings. Hitting a ship moving straight towards or away from you was easier. This recreated the historical old naval strategy of “crossing the T” where the ultimate point of maneuvering was getting into a position where your broadside was aimed at the front or back of an enemy (forming the top of a ‘T’). That’s completely gone in this game. The only thing that affects hit chance is distance, and you can buy skills to even ignore that rule! Any semblance to naval maneuvering is out the window and it becomes all about casting the MMO spells with regular gun damage being just a nice bonus. 90% of maneuvering is just getting into range of the MMO spells and trying to keep ships from bouncing off each other like drunken bumper cars.\n\nThe campaign? I thought this would save the game. A longterm campaign with strategic decisions to make inbetween battles? Sadly, no. The only choice you're presented with every turn is "choose one of two systems to fight for and you'll lose the other one". That's it. It's like an XCOM game with nothing but terror missiosn but dumbed down even more.\n\nIf it was just the over use of MMO cooldown abilities and too fastly paced combat, I say maybe get it and hope that they improve it. However, that in combination with the insane F2P grind model and ship loss penalty push this into an emphatic thumbs down. If you're interested, check the updates and only purchase it if they fix 2 out of 3 of these things.","April 21","false","11.6"," 802 of 1,258 people (64%) found this review helpful 54 people found this review funny","64","802","1","54","59"

It plays like a Tactical RTS and is quite enjoyable in both solo and multiplayer\n\nFull review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFwUKlJLQs4\n\nSummary:\nAs always, a textual summary can't convey the information of a full review video - See the video for the best impression\n\nThe games main gameplay loop, the various battle are both it's main strength and weakness. If you like the more methodical and planned gameplay of picking fleets, customizing ships and assembling your armed forces, then this is a great title. The ship customization, the various races with their unique aspects as well as the large variety of visuals and ships make it amazing.\n\nBut the downside is that ship combat is Slow. Ships take a long while to kill and battles can drag on for longer then enjoyable. This difference between the two aspects of the game will either make it great, or not so great for your personal enjoyment.\n\nThe game's performance is fine, it's voice acting is insanely good and the story, while not "amazing", fits and works within both the game and the lore it is set in.\n\nOverall, i can FULLY recommend the game to any 40k Fan OR/AND anyone that enjoy tactical RTS gameplay.","April 21","true","20.6"," 90 of 128 people (70%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","70","90","128","10","7"

The battles are very tactical with the deciding factors being about who can get the best use of ships rather than economy management.\n\nBoth the multiplayer and single player are based around building up and levelling up a fleet of ships that you then use in battle. The mission you play in both single and  multiplayer are randomly picked from, Cruiser Crash, Escort, Assassination, Data Recovery, Planetary Assault, Breakthrough and Space Station Assault. In Single player they are also custom crafted mission that show up about 1 in 3. The missions never feel like a grind to me because they are fun to play. I play the missions for them, not the levelling up.\n\nThere are some balance issues that still need to be worked out, each side plays very differently and although this is a good thing it dose make it hard to balance out, also some missions are harder than others for the attacker. The point system means that if lower level player meets a high level they still can't use bigger ships as each player has the same number of points to pick. Some people have stability problems but I have had only one crash in 22 hours.\n\nAll in all an excellent game.\n","April 23","true","45.4"," 51 of 66 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","51","66","2","0"

The BFG videogame to end them all?\nYes, and no.\n\nThe game launched a tad too soon with some rather sizable flaws present. However unlike many other devs who push junk to steam with the title "Warhammer", this game holds great promise. This has the potential to be the next great Warhammer game after DoW and Space Marine.\nThe devs listen on the forums and feedback is usually answered to, which to me screams of hope that the game will turn out better and better as time progresses.\n\nNow I'm just making it sound like "it will be a great game, it isn't one now". This is wrong to a degree. If you're still reading this, you're wondering if it is worth it to get the game right now, aren't you?\nIt is well worth the money I feel.\nGameplay is solid, basic balance is there (However needs work on some aspects), visuals are amazing, the game is dripping more WH:40K goodness you could ever want. I myself have encountered only one crash, one. And even this crash I suspect was caused by my computer rather than the game.\nFor me the game runs butter smooth on my mediocre rig even on epic settings.\nThe UI does the trick and controls are easy enough to handle, my only gripe is the hotkeys. Buuut these should get fixed sooner than later.\nThe combat is satisfying, and being an IN player, I like to make use of that ramming prow. I have not yet encountered a more satisfying feeling in a game as I have in this. There's quite nothing like ordering your ship to Brace For Impact, put engines to All Ahead Full and watch as engines push a flame the size of the ship itself and your space cathedral thrusts into the side of an unfortunate heretic ship, both ships jerking from the impact, sparks and pieces flying off the victim out into the cold abyss of space. Eventually the enemy ship gives way and blows up spectacularly and your cruiser plows through the wreckage coldblooded. Sound epic? I hope it did cause the game is absolutely glorious in making the combat feel great.\n\nThe basics of the game are as follows:\nYou have a points limit per match, and you fill it by selecting ships worth of different amounts of points. These ships will then go to face off a foe who chose their ships within similar limitations. Simple right?\n\nBut it doesn't end there, you can customize your ships loadouts to some extent. While you cannot choose which guns you mount on your cruiser of choice, you can choose which abilities it can bring with it. Which upgrades you want for it. Be it better armor and close range ballistics upgrades for a brawler build OR go with maneuverability upgrades and increased ramming damage. OR spec your ship to long range with better accuracy and faster shield regen. The options are there and you're in charge of how YOU want to play your ship.\nAnd the more you play with the same ship, the more skills and upgrade slots you get for it.\nYou can also choose from 4 different favours, each granting different bonuses to the ship.\n\nAs of the moment of writing, we have the Imperial navy, Chaos, Orkz and Eldar. Space Marine fleets advertised as a preorder bonus have not yet been implemented. But it's quite alright, I'd rather see the existing races balanced first before any more is added and I'm sure most of you agree with this.\n\nSo in summary, get this game. Get it now. Balance will come and the game will get refined better and better. It is already glorious and the emperor himself is probably out there playing the game even after 38 millenia have passed since its release.","April 23","true","43.1"," 47 of 60 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","47","60","2","2"

It is probably the best game that I have played in quite a while and I've found myself always coming back to it within a few hours of closing it. The multiplayer has so many options and there is so many ways to customise and tune your ship to certain situations. If you are a fan of Warhammer 40,000 as well, then you are in for a treat as this ties in with the lore as well as telling the story of the 12th Black Crusade of Chaos against the Imperium of Man in the Gothic Sector.\n\nBy far, my fondest moment in this game is trying to take down an enemy vessel, during an data recovery or an assassination mission, while it is charging up their warp engines. Watching the little blue bar climbing, higher and higher, towards the end of the 'charge-up' bar makes your heart beat, your hands sweat and a surge of fear and zeal strikes you as you realise that this is the make it or break it moment and determines whether you win or lose. My second favour moment so far in the game is hiding my 'admiral' ship inside of an asteroid field during the very same type of gamemode and using my other ships to lure the enemy away. Not once have I seen someone that has been able to figure out this tactic until the last moment when I micro-warp jump my 'admiral' ship into clear-view and then activate the warp-engines and quickly escape the battlefield and bring myself to victory.\n\nI completely whole-heartly recommend this game to anyone that is interested in an RTS game that just WORKs. It has leveled itself with my favour RTS game (Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion) and there is still more to come from it in the near and distant future.\n\nBuy this game, it is worth it.","April 24","true","94.7"," 38 of 50 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","38","50","3","2"

I liked this game a lot and I believe it deserves more attention...\n\nI held off buying this game at first thinking I was going to wait for a steam sale. Then I watched some gameplay videos on youtube and decided it was worth giving a shot just to be able to play the arcade matches and maybe some multiplayer even at full price. It definitely lived up to my expectations.\n\nWhat I wasn't expecting was how good the campaign would be. Voice acting is on point and it was a pretty gripping story, however what really suprised me is how they captured the feeling of 'everything going to ♥♥♥♥' rapidly really well. The point where I stopped and thought 'this was really worth the money' was when I found myself with at best 3 planetary systems I could save, the other 5  would have to be ignored and allowed to fall. And it was even worse the next turn and worse the turn after that. It genuinely felt desperite and hopeless, somehow without feeling frustrating.\n\nThat moment and when I realised that ramming chaos and eldar ships is a legit tactic. What's that, you have a shiny nemisis battleship you're bringing to battle that's killed millions of people. Wouldn't it be a shame if someone ... I dunno ... rammed into it from 3 different directions... :P\n\nTLDR: If you like warhammer 40K, you will probably like this game.

Graphics and sound are really good also, the combat feels visceral and the general look and feel of the game is great. At times it can be really fun to play, especially 2v2 with a friend.\n\nEvensMost matches will about 5 minutes. You level up admirals to build the fleet, you dont have free control to pick whatever you like whenever you like (as in the table top). Campaign is okay (I've not played a lot yet) but it seems to mostly be a string of skirmish missions in essence. When playing online you don't have control over what map or game mode you play, or points size, its all random.\n\nCons\nIt’s not release ready, buggy with frequently crashes. It’s missing major features at release; team chat, AI battles with friends, fully open skirmish modes, fully fledged match making and ranked matches. There is a road map[forum.battlefleetgothic-armada.com] to deliver some of these features but they may not be arriving for months. It also looks like the Space Marine DLC will be late.\n\nIf you are expecting massive fleet engagements as shown in the trailers, or even something more modest like 10 ships a side – don’t, you will be disappointed. In a 2v2 game unless you want to spam escorts, you will have about 3 ships per player. The points limit is crushingly low, and apparently[forum.battlefleetgothic-armada.com] it’s not going to change anytime soon.\n\nThe game is so simple, the gameplay is so so shallow. The table top was a naval engagement game, which allowed detailed control of weapons, movement and abilities. This plays more like a battle arena game. There is no real negative aspect or risk to using abilities, and there is no resource cost, so you just spam them as fast as possible. There is limited control over weapons, they just constantly fire. This means for instance you can’t time your weapons for increased effectiveness.\n\nYou control ships with point and click movement, but ships take wide turns to get to places so you never really know where your ships are going. Units don’t maintain formation (a la Total War games), and there is no control over speed. This means it’s almost impossible to move your fleet in a concerted manner, i.e. escorts will always arrive in battle before your cruisers.\n\nSummaryThis game was released a month late, and it feels like it still needs a few more months. If you like 40k then you may like this, otherwise I would pass.","April 29","false","64.8"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","24","28","0","0"

I want to enthusiastically give it TWO THUMBS UP!! But I can't. This game was clearly well designed in ship mechanics, art, platform, layout, and detail given to each class of ship. This game however, fails spectacularly in tactics. In that it has and requires none. I'll try to explain.\n\nHere's the dilema almost any naval game faces whether it's on sea or in space. Realistically, naval combat can last for hours, and hours chasing someone and nit-picking them, OR two sides duke it out and very quickly blast one another. So a game dev can't make a never ending map for those games where one guy just wants to run fast. SO, they have to make a grid to form the "arena". This is where Armada fails big. The majority of the missions they developed favor the "chase me" game style. Missions like, assassination, data recovery, break through, convoy. If your fleet is faster you will likely win those missions easily because you only have to escape this grid arena. When in all actuality space doesn't end simply where the grid ends....it goes on, and on, and on, much like this review I'm giving. So if speed equals wins by default, you practically remove tactics from the game. For me that's a HUGE no-no. Armada badly needs more missions that force two opponents to clash with one another. Devs, in short, since a naval game needs borders/grid/arena you have to create more than one mission (cruiser clash) where the overwhelming majority of the ships you designed can be fielded properly. If not, what is the point in having anyone but the Eldar in this game?\n\nMan, I HATED writing this review and giving it a thumbs down.","April 26","false","27.3"," 171 of 285 people (60%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","60","171","285","8","10"

The art design nails the cartoonishly grim feel of the universe and the campaign presents it in a similar way as Dawn of War II (in all the right ways). The actual gameplay feels like a refined version of the naval battles from Rome total war, and the additional abilities and general number of ships you're commanding at any given time makes it generally more enjoyable and more of a tactical experience. The developers basically nailed the amount of persistence and customization to give the ships, both making you feel invested in upgrading ships and miserable when you make a mistake and let one of your prized battlecruisers go up in flames, while still maintaining some amount of balance for players who are just beginning the game. The factions are very assymmetric and this leads to some favored matchups depending on which mission is being played. While the basic cruiser clash is quite balanced, things like convoy missions are much easier with the Eldar than say the Imperium, due to differences in ship speed and strength. This is still being worked on by the developers and in a few patches I think it will be really quite good, but even as is, the slight imbalances act more as quirks to work your strategy around, rather than straight up flaws that make the game unenjoyable.\nWhile there are complaints about the 2d layout of this space game, it does make sense from its tabletop origins and after several matches I stopped questioning why my mile-long flying-space-cathedral had a design that was somewhere between Admiral nelsons flagship and a roman ram ship. You will often hear people whining that there aren't more factions, do not take this as a foul cry against this game, but rather know that people love this universe deeply and want to see their favorite races in the game. However when they do come out with the (I hope) inevitable dlc that includes the Necrons, Tau, tyrannids, and other factions, I will be buying that without a second thought.\nThis game is fun. It's very niche and has a bit of a learning curve, but it is thoroughly and completely enjoyable to play and I'll give props to the developers for letting me ram space cathedrals into floating ork rustbuckets. Do them the favor and give them your money, they've earned it.\n\n","April 22","true","70.4"," 34 of 47 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","34","47","0","0"

I bring ancient, ahem cough, wisdom to this short review.\nSpaceships and factions are all very well rendered with the unreal engine bringing them to life in very dark and atmospheric ways.  The various missions conform for the most part to the original game.  The campaign cut scenes are engaging and moving.  Unlike the turn based original,  all the action occurs in real time, with a bullet time option to slow things down giving you time to zoom in to the action and behold the carnage.  Of course this also gives you time to issue new orders when things get crazy and put together tactical plays.\nThe empire ships feel spot on and just as I imagined from the original turn based game.  Slow but purposeful with strong fire power good armor and exceedingly slow speed.\nChaos seem a little weak on long range firepower relying heavily on lances and suffer from weaker armor but have faster speed than the empire.\nThe Orc ships are well presented but are heavily reliant on micro warp jump and taunt to close with faster more manuverable ships ie everyone else !\nIf you love pressure and extreme micro management then the Eldar are your fleet of choice.  They come with some very strong firepower but lack armor and are extremely fragile.  The holoshields their ships hide behind require that the player keeps them on the move.  The faster they go the harder the eldar corsairs are to hit.\nWith space marines just around the corner and another yet to be announced new fleet in the works this game is full of potential and so far goes a long way to realising that BFG itch that resides in the hearts and minds of the GW faithful.  It's also a pretty fine two dimensional ship to ship combat game.  What more can I say ?  WAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGG !  Blood for the Blood God ! and in the name of the Emperor enjoy !\n","April 21","true","148.8"," 47 of 70 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","47","70","5","0"

It may be due to my low experience in tabletop Gothic or my sufficiently low expectations, but I actually found myself surprisingly enough enjoying the game.\n\nIt should be stated that the game is real time, which does mean it works very differently from the turn based tabletop version. However, unlike many other Games Workshop licensed video games Battlefleet Gothic: Armada manages to capture the spirit of the original -while- also providing mechanically solid game.\n\nMatches are fast paced and typically last about 5 - 15 minutes depending on fleet size. Customizeable battle fleets and some half a dozen scenarios with different winning conditions mean that no match plays out quite like the last, though it has to be said that at the moment certain scenarios feel a bit lopsided, and the matches may get repetitive as nearly all of them seem to involve both players boosting to the middle and grinding it out. The winner is often determined by which one has the better fleet composition, faster reaction speed and greater control over their fleet.\n\nDespite the repetitiveness and certain level of lopsidedness Battlefleet Gothic: Armada does have good frame on which to add features that increase the strategic depth, and even if those features were not added the game is still an enjoyable tactical space brawl game, although admittedly on the lighter side of the spectrum.\n\nIs it Battlefleet Gothic the board game in video game format? No, it is not.\nIs it an entertaining little space brawl game faithful to the spirit of the original? Yes!\nCan you shout "WAAAGH!", fire all the boosters, and crash through your own vessels in order to ram your Ork space bukkit on the enemy flagship?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SaraiNG/recommended/363680/","SaraiNG","Sarai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SaraiNG/","80 products in account","At the present time I can't recommend this game for a number of reasons as noted below:\n\n- There are a number of bugs that have carried over from the Beta into the game. Although these may get fixed, some of them are really annoying. Examples include UI errors, key binding problems and crashes that occur. A particular favourite crash seems to be when I go over the number of ships "allowed" by beaming in reinforcements using a particular favour.\n\n- There is an interesting single player campaign, but on normal there are insane difficulty spikes. A good example is a mission defending a crippled ship from waves of other ships. Unless you resort to "pin ball" (more later) it is very hard to win with proper tactics.\n\n- "Pin ball" revolves around using high energy turns and thrusters to ram other ships and keep ramming them. The AI is poor at avoiding this tactic, so for example in the aforementioned mission, a cruiser with the 50% ram upgrade was able to take out most of their LCs leaving the crippled ship over 75% HP before it warped out. Without this pin-ball attempt, I was failing it badly. This tactic works in MP as well, although some players are skillful enough now to try and avoid it.\n\n- The graphics are great, but there are problems. Despite having 'Epic settings', I need to Micro my dual graphics cards to smooth out rough edges and deal with zoom problems. Maybe it's my config, but don't normally have to do this.\n\n- The skirmish is limited to 700 points. For those who aren't yet aware, this means a handful (4 to 6 ships). When you try and team up with a friend or AI, this is reduced to 350 points each which in extreme means one capital ship and a tiny escort each.\n\n- Missions in MP and Skirmish include horrors such as "Assassination" or "Data Retrieval" which against a few of the factions (looking at the Point Ears here) are very hard. They are much faster and you have to board their ship to try and win. Kiting Imperial or Ork becomes easy.\n\nOverall, this game reminds me of Star Fleet Command and Star Fleet Command 2, but with less features. Those older games, while set in a different universe offered all the same tricks (bombs, shuttles, high energy turns, cloaking, ship design, etc) while also offering a 6 player multiverse for persistent fights. There were also better modes for MP (e.g. start in a tiny ship and progress upwards as destroyed) that rewarded skill more than BFG. Although BFG is now very far ahead graphically, there is no gameplay innovation, so this is a purchase for people who like the universe (or who don't like Star Trek).\n\nFinally, the MP and Skirmish is poor. 2 v 2 is the max, and you can't matchmake with friends, so it's allways randoms.","April 22","false","36.0"," 180 of 311 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","180","311","6","10"

Some of the mission objectives are incredibly frustrating and the randomized nature of the maps and enemy composition leads to difficulty spikes that sap some of the fun from the game.\n\nThat aside the game is a lot of fun with an enjoyable progression system and the ability to play as 4 (later 6) factions in skirmish and multiplayer, all faithful to the 40K universe.

This review is also mainly about multiplayer which does include 2v2 (Partner invite) - I have played the single player campaign, it is enjoyable however this will be focused on online.\n\nAs someone who had access to the beta, I can assure you I was not 100% content that this game should have been released as a finished title. There are many issues that are still plaguing this game and without naming all of them I am going to point out the larger ones that have made this game almost unplayable for me.\n\nCritical errors and crashes to desktops and bugs - This is the biggest issue for me and for many others who I have been in contact within the forums. Whats even more strange is the fact we never had this issue in the beta (not me anyway). This game constantly crashes in all modes, but more particular in battles where there are more ships such as in online 2v2. This alone breaks the game for me, there isn't a worse bug out there then a CTD and this is something you would expect in beta, not in a final release. (Edit) - I forgot to mention that ship abilities sometimes just do not work within battles and now a camera bug that see's your camera pan to the other side of the map and the only way of getting out is by alt F4.\nMatch making - Oh god where do i begin with the match making, this game is not optomised well for multiplayer and it seems that the problems are not as bad in 1v1 but within 2v2 its terrible. An example is me and my partner (Both level 3 admirals) versing two Imperial Admirals with Battle Cruisers and a Battleship. Rightio? I don't know if anyone has played MMO's like WoW but its like walking into a pvp zone as a level 60 and a horde level 100 just stops in to say hello. Its not good - and to those people who say its not unwinable its not the point, it breaks the game from a progression stand point. Another big issue is that even if you come against a higher level admiral and your say level 3, they can only bring as many points as you can (300 typical for that level) however the ships they bring in can be higher level. This is completely rigged as a level 8 light cruiser with full upgrades will decemate one without them. Match making is horrible.\nServers and Connection errors - The worse thing about joining a game that takes about 2 minutes is to find out your partner is also Russian and the game completely lags out and dies. Many times people are getting stuck on the Admiral show case screen (before you can select your ships). I am Aussie and constantly connecting with people in Europe where their latency and myself have been within the high 800's. Even if you manage to get past the ship sellection screen you wont be able to play more then 2 minutes until someone crashes due to latency.\nInstability - The game runs pretty poor and has some real ugly textures up close, not only does it struggle on even high end cards such as an 980, I have heard horror stories with people with Radeon cards are getting fried. It doesn't seem like this game should be struggling but it might have something to do with why so many people are crashing. Something has happened between the beta and release that is causing this game to melt computers, so be warned.\n\nThis is already going on long enough so i'll stop here. All people have to do is look at the forums before purchasing this game and search for any of these issues, you will find a boat load of them. Its easy for people like IGN who shove a review on this game 4 minutes after release and its another for someone to actually put TIME into this game after release and then write a review with concerns.\n\nDon't buy this game as of this moment until it is patched, its fairy cheap compared to many others out there.. however in its current state it's not worth your hard earned dollarydoos.\n\n(Edit) - I have just been messaged by someone who I am gathering thumbed down this review who I will not name, plus I don't really care but I will point out this lovely young fellow also posted  a thumbs up review of this game with less then 30 minutes of gameplaying saying "Buy this", bravo sir bravo sir, your a real inspiration.\n\n(Edit)  - Once again, this REVIEW is concentrating on the online elements of this game and 2v2. Please try and understand this and actually put in more then 1 hour of gameplay with both 1v1 and 2v2 / invite a partner before reviewing the online elements. Simply doing a few battles online and giving it the thumbs up is as lazy as IGN.\n\n(Edit 9 May, 2016) - So there has been two extra major patches that have been released since the game has come out. They have fixed a wide array of issues and bugs however many of my previous issues have STILL not been adressed. The matchmaking for one is an absolute joke still and server connections result in lag and disconnections as their is STILL no regional match-making. I decided to test the new patches with a Eldar admrial, although I did not get any CTD's as soon as I went back into 2v2 "surprise surprise" it CTD. The two other issues also that STILL have not been addressed is matchmaking per admirals, my level 2 light cruisers with my level 3 admiral is still getting thrashed with other players with level 8 light cruisers in (300 point) matches. For all the people who insist its not difficult to defeat a level 8 admiral have obviously never gone up againsts their ships being 3x the level yours are with all their abilities unlocked. Lastly.. cheaters... this is the biggest issue I have so far. This game is riddled with cheaters, from people who can make their Nova Cannons 3x as big and fire 3x as fast to people bringing in extra ships more to their point structure, I honestly am about to give up on this game.\n\nDont listen to the fanboys who insist this game is a working wonder, its not and after almost a month of release this game is still as buggy and disappointing as release. Save yourself the money, you wont regret not making this purchase. The dev's seem to have a good isight into the future of the game, but with this many issues I feel any more content will just lead to more issues. I would of expected the dev's to have sorted out these issues by now.","April 24","false","68.6"," 64 of 105 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","64","105","2","1"

First things first, do I recommend it? Wholeheartedly yes!\n\nNow that's out of the way, on to my thoughts about this game. I will be say that I've decided to base my review on the feel and atmosphere of this game, it's faithfulness to the feel of the Warhammer 40k universe, especially with an eye to past 40k games. I won't be reviewing it on the gameplay in depth simply because I do not play enough RTSes to feel qualified to make an assessment either way.\n\nIs this game faithful to the 40k universe? Very much so I feel. One of the most striking things personally was listening to the soundtrack, the background music, the dialogue, and finding a welcome familiarity about it. It's as if the people in charge of the music at Tindalos Interactive had sat down to listen to all of Dawn of War II's music and dialogue. Some of those ship captains sound like they could be voiced by the Lord General in DoW2: Retribution. The music, with long mournful organ notes and soaring choral performances, is eerily reminiscent of DoW2: Retribution too. This helps the game feel a strong connection with previous 40k titles from Relic.\n\nSet against the backdrop of the 12th Black Crusade, the story thrusts you into a pivotal role in fighting against the various enemies of mankind. The weight of expectations lends a tension to each mission, even though mission types are picked from a standardised set. Despite that you do feel a sense of progression and each battle feels unique. The levelling up of ships and your admiral, and the amount of combinations for ship builds, gives you that additional sense of progression, and the motivation to want to win every single battle. Add in epic clashes involving ships of tremendous infamy such as the Terminus Est, and you feel a firm sense that you're right at the heart of the 12th Black Crusade.\n\nI personally also love the difficulty scaling. I think it's perfect. Easy is just about right for casual players like me, normal is challenging, and hard and heroic are perfect for those who're bored easily if they're not juggling 9 chainsaws on fire. Something for everyone, just the way inclusive gaming should be.\n\nConclusion: for any 40k fan who's been bemoaning the lack of any serious 40k titles over the last few years, this is the answer to your prayers to the God-Emperor/Ruinous Powers/Gork & Mork/Greater Good or whoever it is you pray to... heretic. I would recommend it even at its full price, and I hope that more content is to come. The foundations are there for this to be the big spiritual successor to DoW2, and I hope Tindalos Interactive seizes that opportunity with both hands!","April 22","true","45.4"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","20","28","0","2"

You take command of a fleet of ships and traverse a 2D board with your vessels having to take careful notice of their manuevering and alignment with enemy vessels and all while avoiding (or using to your advantage) various environmental hazards (such as debris fields). The game takes careful notice of finer details such as momentum and these details can even influence your tactics during battle. A great (and dramatic) example being the ability to sail a ship into an enemy vessel; ramming them with your own spaceship. Aim well and use the correct ships for this tactic and it can be very useful for dispatching tougher foes.\n\nEvery servant has his place, no matter how lowly or modest. To know it is his greatest comfort, to excel within it is his greatest solace, and his master's contentment is his greatest reward.\n\nAs the commander of your fleet you get a choice of many different ships, this selection expanding as you fight in more battles and yourself gain experience, that can grow with the gaining of experience during battle. This then allows you to fit them with skills, upgrades and customise their crew priorities. These features might seem slightly overwhelming at first but with a careful understanding of the game mechanics they can allow for quite a lot of tactical customisation in a fleet.\n\nContact with alien races always renews one's faith in humanity. It is my belief that foreign travel narrows the mind wonderfully.\n\nIn both Singleplayer Skirmish and Multiplayer you may command one of four discrete races: The Imperial Navy, Chaos, Ork Pirates and Eldar Corsairs. Each race is very distinct in the ways that they play and the tactics they favour. They are far from simply different skins on the same ships. Both Orks and Eldar can prove quite challenging to play, with the game recommending the Imperial Navy and Chaos for beginners. I second this notion!\n\nThe universe has many horrors yet to throw at us. This is not the end of our struggle. This is just the beginning of our crusade to save Humanity. Be faithful! Be strong! Be vigilant!\n\nThe Space Marines and another, yet unannounced fleet, are yet to be added and buying the game early means you can get these DLC for free on release bringing the total number of playable factions to 6. I'm personally interested to see how the Space Marine fleets and the Imperial Navy differ tactically.\n\nAll ahead full and damn the torped...--\n\nThere are bugs, there are imbalances in multiplayer and the races can be quite different and difficult to get used to both fighting as and fighting against. Will this stoke a heavy competitive e-sport scene? Unlikely. If you're looking for a fun stratagy game set in Warhammer 40,000's deep universe then this is a great choice full of flavour, solid gameplay and a long single-player campaign with promise of an OK multiplayer experience.","April 25","true","27.2"," 26 of 39 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","26","39","0","0"

I play mostly story mode or single player because i feel the game design could be rage inducing vs humans. And i refuse to play games that make me mad. So keep that in mind when you read this.\n\nMost of the games i have played are against Chaos. And the tactics used by them are just frustrating. They outpace Imperial ships by a vast margin, to the point where i avoid Data Recovery missons and Assassination missions where im the attacker because i just wont be able to catch the ship in question, and if i do it takes soo long and is soo frustrating to try and keep up and deal out enough dammage..... just not that much fun. At least the Eldar have to close the distance to shoot at you, so as long as you dont have to catch them, they are not as "rage inducing" as everyone says. Actually playing a defender Assassination misson vs Eldar is usually very comical. But im off point.\n\nThe main problem is that the main difference in this game from the tabletop game is the potential DPS. A good broadside from a cruiser with some lucky rolls could criple another cruiser, or dammage it and leave it covered in blast markers. Making it hard to shoot back or even safely move away. So when one fleet had a speed advantage, it was not a huge deal, because you could do heavy dammage with a single broadside. And in the computer version, your battleship will peck away at light cruisers and slowly take hp away as the ship darts away to safety. Its just something that will grind away at your paitence. Sometimes a full broadside from a Retrubuition class battleship can kill an escort in one shot, but more often than not, the escort will take more than one broadside to kill.\n\nSo overall, its good, i think. Right now this game makes me mad more often than i have fun with it. And im pretty sure its got a lot to do with the extremely low DPS compared to the tabletop version and the speed is just not balanced for it.\n\nAlso on my first playthrough of the story mode i chose the "Ironman" save mode so i could not go back to an old save and redo a failed misson. I figured it would add some tension to the choices i had to make, and i was right. Had a great time right untill it crashed in the final battle and counted the misson as a loss. and for some reason, no matter how many more turns i played, the last misson would not re-trigger. So that was about 30 hours of my time wasted.\n\nSo right now i cant recomend it. It might be for you, but not what i wanted. I wanted ships that hit harder.","May 14","false","100.2"," 35 of 58 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","35","58","4","5"

It is mostly 3 or 4 ships you control. You can level up your Admiral (player avatar) and get more ship slots to a maximum of 1 battleship, 2 battlecruiser, 3 Cruiser and 4 light cruiser slots. Your ships get xp in battles and you can customize them with upgrades. Light cruiser have 1 skill , cruiser 2, bc 3 and the battleship has 4 skills. It plays like your generic 18th hundred line ship battle simulator. Manovering, broadsiding and entering enemy ships, you know the drill.\n\nIn the story singleplayer campaign you have a star map to decide which mission you take. The planet systems are not animated but some dots with lines between them, to represent shipping lanes, but you never actually drive around in your ship. For each chapter there are main story missions you have to do before going on random missions. In the singleplayer campaign you play as imperial navy.\n\nFor each chapter there is a comic cutscene not a video but static pictures with limited animation.\n\nThe story is average, the babbel between different characters is quite nice, the atmossphere is good and warhammer40k like. Mostly it is about evil chaos trying to steal artifacts and you the "good" guys trying to stop them. Imperials are a bunch of theocratic space nazis, so they are not really that good.\n\nThere are 5 edit: 7 mission types:\n\n1. Cruiser Clash: Fight between two fleets or more.\n2. Assassination attack/defend: You have to detroy a target ship before the time runs out and it manages to escape.\n3 Breakthrough attack/defend: You have to destroy some defense platforms and then escape with your line ships to    the other side of the battlefield\n4 Data steal attack/defend: You have to board an target ship and steal data. Then you have to escape with the data on your ship.\n5. Planetary attack/defend: You have to fly your capital ships to a target zone in time. You get a point each time you reach a target zone in time. You have to get 3 target zone out of 5.\n6. Space station defend/attack: You have to attack or defend a space station.\n7. Convoy escort defend/attack: You have to defend your convoy transports or destroy them as the attacker.\n\nThe difficulty is really hard even on easy. The ai ships fire their skills with pin point accuracy and it is really hard to get anything done in the campaign. The random missions are a little easier until you have to fight orks in cruiser clash or eldar in data steal or assassination. Then it gets really ugly. Tindalos did not bother to implement difficulty settings for the ai, it is playing at full potential in every game. Not that the AI is intellligent or anything. AI ships tend to destroy themselves by flying straight through asteroid fields all the time.\n\nThe ship design is really lazy: For each faction you have a couple of escort ship types and cruisers. All cruisers have the same base modell with little upgrades on top, a bigger central bridge for the bigger class. All cruiser modells look the same for each faction.\n\nThe tactical battle map is somehow confusing. The backgrounds blend in and make it difficult to see e.g. asteroid fields or gas clouds in the foreground, not on all maps but some are really confusing. There is no tactical overview map, that is really missing to plan anything. You have to pan around with your camera and it is difficult to know what is going on, when several battles are going on. The micro managing requirements are really high, but you can set some skills reliable to autouse for the ships ai.\n\nMultiplayer:\n\nMultiplayer Balance between factions is totally out of place.\n\nBoring mp matches with only 300 points per player on 2 vs 2. That are 2 ships one cruiser and a light cruiser, yeah the fun.\n\nBoring, imbalanced game modes that favor fast and agile factions like the dreaded eldar.  It is virtually impossible to do assassination or data steal missions against them.\n\nSpace station defense favors the defender heavily.\nedit: Some say that the attacker is heavily favored. Okay torpedo, bomber , nova cannon spam is not interesting gameplay. Or ramming the space station to death as imperials, orks.\n\nPlanetary attack favors the defender heavily. You get some defense stations with stasis bomb/snare skills.\n\nedit: Fast factions are obviously better at planetary attack. Lumbering orks or imperials have it rough to get to the ground attack target areas, but they can try to destroy the defending fleet.\n\nThe only somewhat fun mission type in single and multiplayer is cruiser clash, but then the imbalanced factions kill the fun.\n\nFaction imbalance:\nYou have the imperial navy with slow ships, good firepower at close to middle rangewith good armor and average ship costs.\n\nThen you have orks with slow ships, excellent firepower at close to middle range with superb frontal armor und low ship costs. You can field more ships then an imperial player and have more hp and firepower on your ships. Sounds fair? You can not kite them as imperial and in close range they eat you up.\n\nChaos has fast ships good firepower at long range, medium armor and average ships costs, they eat imperial and ork ships at long range. They have somewhat trouble against eldar, but have a chance to catch them.\n\nEldar have excellent firepower at long range, they can dish out a ton of damage with their pulsar lasers. Eldar ships are weak and fragile, vulnerable to ramming attacks. They have the fastest and nimblest ships of all factions. They can easily stay out of range and poke you with their pulsar lances. Eldar battleships are capable of litterally oneshotting their counterparts. All you have to do is to stay out of range, no one has a chance beside chaos to catch you if you play right. Eldar are superior in game modes like assassination defender or datasteal, they are too fast and can escape easily, they are twice as fast as the other factions in the game.\n\nSometimes your skills do not work in multiplayer.\n\nSometimes you can not play with your friends in multiplayer.\n\nSometimes the game servers are offline.\n\nSometimes your Admirals are deleted.\n\nThere is no real matchmaking. Players of all levels are happily mixed together in matches. Level 1 against an experienced lvl 10 player. no problem, have fun.\n\nYou can not play coop with friends against the AI, the singleplayer campaign has no coop mode.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you really like the warhammer40k universe or the game battlefleet gothic, this game might be your thing. But if you like interesting, fair, balanced tactical games that are fun to play and not frustrating, then look elsewhere.\n\nThank you for reading,\n\nHave a nice day.","April 25","false","61.2"," 175 of 321 people (55%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","55","175","321","12","25"

I jumped onboard this particular bandwagon back when it was just the chaos and imp fleets during the beta. I put a few hours into the beta (65 odd of my current total) and the rest into the single player campaign.\n\nI should point out, i am an AVID fan of the 40k universe. I play practically every tabletop game that is made by games workshop and even the rpgs etc made by fantasy flight games along with having read just about every book set in the 40k and old world universes. So i feel i have a reasonably good knowledge base within which to set this review.\n\nI will also point out, that this is my first proper game review. I am usually more of a watcher and a waiter when it comes to beta/Early Access games, but this one in particular caught my eye. Firstly it is due to my love of the old Battlefleet Gothic tabletop game. I played that game endlessly with friends and family. I love the idea of piloting a half dozen lumps of ceramite and plasteel 5+ kilometers long into HOLY BATTLE WITHT THE BLIGHTED HERETICS!!! ahem..... its exhilirating... and so is this game.\n\nI feel that this game has kept particularly true to the tabletop game in regards to its play style. it feels simliar to me. When i moved my ships around the table and tried to line up nice dual broadsides or a choice torpedo spread, the sluggishness of those gigantic hunks of metal moving around the void is extremely similar to how i feel when im trying to turn my battlecruiser abeam of another vessel to unleash the EMPEROR'S HOLY WRATH UPON THE FOUL XENOS!!!!!! .... sorry... caught up in the moment.\n\nMy point is that the games feel very similar and i like that. Even the other races have a feel similar to playing them on the tabletop, excepting that a battle can be over in a matter of minutes if you maneuver correctly and pincer your foe, or corner them (in the case of a data retrieval or assassination mission). however, i have also had engagements that lasted over an hour as my opponent and i tried desperately to out turn or out thrust one another and bring down their last ship (with my last light cruiser on 100 hp and busted ♥♥♥ shields/guns/engines..... (speaking from experience on that one).\n\nOk since i feel like im blabbing on a little much, i will attempt to get back on track and wind this novel up.\n\nSo Pros:\n\n- Nice graphic effects,\n- I like the sounds and music (very gothic)\n- The gameplay is fun and challenging if a tad repetitive\n- Replayability (4 races with a view to more and many different ship configs) is great, i never felt bored, usually i would log on thinking "hmm id really like to try eldar today and see if i can get the hang of keeping those damned holofields up all the time"... or something similar. there was usually always something i wanted to do in the game.\n- The campaign is fun and varied - i was pleased to note that there are a bunch of non standard mission types mixed in with the "standard" complement of missions (cruiser clash, data recov, assass etc) it keeps the campaign feeling new and not TOO repetitive.\n\nPros:\n\n- Price. The cost is kinda high, but i also kinda feel its worth it... almost...maybe slightly less.... but then ive ALWAYS thought that... about basically everything GW has ever put out... so why should this be any different :-P - ever bought anything from Forge World? case in point.....\n- Bugs. As ive seen mentioned and experienced myself, there is still a couple of bugs that carried over into the main game and a few typos and tooltips that need to be corrected to show the data for the race that you are playing... eldar dont technically have "lances" etc...\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nI like this game. ive played it a fair bit. i dont mind games that have a bit of a grind in it, makes it feel like im a fleet captain learning to use a fleet in combat. it appeals to me and my sense of the 40k universe. I love 40k, i love almost everything to do with the universe and all it contains. it is vast and detailed and that appeals to my twisted little mind.\n\nanyway, if you like smashing huge lumps of steel together and calling it battle, BUY IT!!\n","April 23","true","89.8"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MarquisGT/recommended/363680/","MarquisGT","Marquis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MarquisGT/","159 products in account","'Battlefleet Gothic: Armada' is a laudable attempt at sincerely recreating the now long and lamentably defunct tabletop wargame, 'Battlefleet Gothic' produced by Games Workshop as part of their old Specialist Games range. A spin-off of their iconic Warhammer 40,000 universe, this new iteration of the game perfectly captures the atmosphere of the 41st Millenium as envisaged in Games Workshop's famously grim, dark future where mankind's vast and crumbling stellar empire is beset within and without by physical and spiritual peril, the likes of which split the very stars themselves asunder.\n\nThe three core elements of the game, fleet management, campaign management and actual combat, are all redolent of the original tabletop experience. Fleet management harkens back to the RPG elements of Game Workshop's earlier titles, and whilst some might initially find the micro-management a little overwhelming, it becomes surprisingly intuitive and the various information panels (both static and pop-up) do readily clarify the player's various options, neatly and succinctly. Campaign management ostensibly provides chained systems of planets, which are a familiar staple of Science Fiction RTS games, however the player will more often than not find themself directed by the narrative to particular deployments of note, although it is worth noting, there is some degree of oversight in fully explaining the campaign interface and players should keep an eye on their deployment points, so as not to end turns prematurely and waste opportunities to claim systems not tacitly mentioned by the narrative. Players should also make regular return visits to Port Maw, to upgrade and re-equip the vessels available to them, as they earn reknown (the game's currency equivalent)\n\nActual combat will not be to every gamer's taste, as the game endeavours to remain faithful to its tabletop roots, thus whilst action notionally occurs in 'real time', heavy use of a 'bullet time' style mechanic is necessary to not only allow players to better manage combat, but to plan ahead and perform more elaborate manouvres, switch between various firing options (such as fore or broadside), utilise special abilities, make best use of certain weapons (such as ensuring torpedoes' trajectories take them to where a target *will* be, rather than where they *are*), and target specific systems on larger vessels moment-by-moment. That being said, this does allow for a decidedly tactical level of gameplay, provides immense satisfaction when strategies are successful, and is conducive to maintaining the atmosphere of the player as an admiral responsible for conducting every key facet the intricate ballet of void warfare between massive, kilometre-long vessels designed to utterly annihilate one another.\n\nThe most notable and annoying absence in the game however, is the lack of replay feature for individual battles in the narrative campaign. Whilst veteran players may appreciate this degree realism, and the fact that the campaign appears to adjust accordingly (failures losing you systems or assets), less experienced or more casual players may find this a frustrating oversight, as it appears one lost battle can significantly alter the character and progress of the overall narrative campaign and this can be especially disgruntling in situations where the player may feel their loss was more to do with the nature of the scenario and various unknown variables it was impossible to 'out play', rather than any failing on their part. Many such scenarios would still prove no less challenging if replayed, but the player would at least have the opportunity to try out different fleet compositions and strategies, and not feel cheated of battles that are arguably unwinnable unless one happens to chance upon the winning method straight off the bat. Hopefully, this is an issue which will be addressed in future updates.\n\nThat being said, if you are at all familiar with the Warhammer 40,000 universe, were lucky enough to enjoy playing the original tabletop version of this game, or are currently playing one of its many spiritual successors as part of the current renaissance in tabletop gaming (such as Star Wars: Armada, Dystopian Wars, Firestorm: Armada, Halo: Fleet Battles or Dropship Commander), then this is an absolute must as, small niggles aside, you will not be disappointed: Especially with the promise of further development to come, and the possibility of future DLC including other iconic races and forces.\n\nIn the God-Emperor's name...","April 23","true","12.6"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CCISolitude/recommended/363680/","CCISolitude","Solitude (Emrys)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CCISolitude/","219 products in account","I'm going to make a few things clear before I start.\n\n1: This review only covers the single player/skirmish modes - I've not played and therefore have no opinion on the multi-player aspects.\n\n2: I bought the game outright after playing the early access and was hopeful of so much more, so my opinion is coloured by the lack (essentially) content/depth that could have made this an outstanding game in addition to the other issues I shall expand upon.\n\nI am something of a 40K afficionado, I have I suspect if not -all- the novels, short stories and audio titles, then probably very close unto. I used to play various GW table top many (many) years ago and have numerous fond memories of doing so. When this game was announced I was thoroughly excited, and the early access whetted that appetite.\n\nSadly though, the end product as delivered is a significant let down. The campaign mode is unforgiveably shallow, being probably 90% rinse and repeat of the same few mission options time and time again. Escort, blockade, assassination, extermination (or Cruiser Clash as they've dubbed it) and what essentially passes for a flavoured Escort mission parameter with the 'Data Courier' missions. To be clear, I persevered through to the end of the single player, just to be thorough. But time and time again was sadly dissapointed by the entire game.\n\nFor a franchise that is so very very rich with content; both canon in nature from GW and Black Library, and non-canon from everywhere else - the Black Crusades should have provided an expansive canvas upon which the developers could have done so so much. This is not the case however.\n\nContent aside, there are numerous issues with the game itself.\n\n* The UI in the map-mode is overly large and clunky, the ship lab UI is often un-responsive and often unclear. Especially the upgrades, requiring an overly large amount of back and forth between the few hull types to see quite what each option really gives you.\n* Over all ship types are actually quite limited, and nothing like the scope there could have been to really make a pattern of hull your own; and the upgrades system for crew, ship modifications and extra abilties feels like a veneer.\n* The game mode also sufers from scaling issues, the max zoom-out level puts me very much in mind of the original Dawn of War so what you can see with any sense of relevance is far far too limited. Indeed at the larger end of weapons for the Imperials, your ships are firing on targets that your unable to track effectively or sensibly.\n* Game audio is also painfully unlevelled - the story missions with their unique audio snippets are often drowned out by the music that is otherwise quiet when you're playing at any other time - especially in the last mission in fact where I quite literally couldn't hear a word that was being said and had to rely on the text boxes as given.\n* The campaign mission parameters and limitations are ludicrious, possibly even antiquated; rarely did I have more than 3 or 4 ships on the field at any given time, often only 2 in order to have some escort ships; and sadly this same limitation is carried over into the skirmish modes.\n* The skirmish mode is a direct clone of the campaign modes with no expansion on the idea what so ever; making it seemingly impossible to do anything more involved - again, a limitation for no reason that I can discern. GIven the immense success of the Apocalypse mod for Dawn of War, I'm amazed that GW licensed developers haven't managed to work out what most of the player base actually want from GW games...\n* Missions are timed for 20 minutes, but whether it's my play-style or not, I rarely had any fight that lasted more than 5 minutes. The data-runner missions especially.\n* As mentioned already, the upgrade paths for ships feels only skin deep - and in truth most of the abilities I never used at all.\n\nAll in all, I honestly wish I'd spent my money elsewhere - I appreciate that they've probably built the game in mind hoping to build an active multi-player community and I wish them luck with that; but as we've seen with so many games over the last decade, single player feels to have been an after thought - and in this case a very poorly executed one at that.","May 22","false","27.9"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","0"

This title is based off of the table top game of the same name and, overall, does a great job of capturing the spirit of the original. In this game, fleets of ships which are miles long duke it out in spectacular ways. Micro-management skills are key here, and though it may seem daunting at first, it becomes second nature in no time, and you always have "Tactical Cogitators" at hand to slow things down when needed. As you position your fleets in various ways in order to adapt with the changing battlefield, it becomes extremely satisfying when your plans work and enemy ships flee the theatre or erupt, leaving a shattered wreck in their place. There are a plethora of tactics for every race against every other race, and figuring those tactics out will be essential to victory. Do you ram that ship who is trying to warp out of combat or would that hurt you more than your target? Do you take large capital ships into battle or stick with smaller, more nimle escort ships? Do you board your enemy? Sacrifice a ship in order to spring a trap? Use environmental hazzards to your advantage? Your options are numerous.\n\nThere are differences in this game to other adapted Games Workshop titles: Blood Bowl and Space Hulk stuck to dice rolls, whereas BFGA does for the Battlefleet Gothic table top what Dawn of War did for the Warhammer 40,000 table top - that is to take the concept, do away with the dice rolls and turn based gameplay and then reinvent it as a modern, RTS game. As an old Battlefleet player I can tell you that BFGA is a fine recreation of a classic (albeit overshadowed) tabletop game and doing away with the dice rolls and turns was the best decision to make for the video game.\n\nCurrently, there are 4 races in the game: The Imperial Fleet, Chaos Fleet, Ork Raiders or Eldar Corsairs. There are 2 more races to be included in the game, one of which will be the Space Marines and another race which, as of yet, has not been revealed.\n\nThe game modes included so far are a campaign, which is very linear and brutally punishing but has a wonderful atmosphere which beautifully draws you in to the Warhammer universe.\nMultiplayer, is currently matchmade only. While there is a 2v2 game mode where you can invite a friend as an ally, you cannot manually set up opposing teams which, quite frankly, is a very bizarre oversight. There are plans to add more customisation to this in the near future.\nSolo skirmish is where I spend the bulk of my game time. Here you can pick a fleet (you can use multiple fleets, having a few fleets for every race if you wish) and commit to a game against the AI with random game rules and "renown" limits which assigns point values to certain ships in order to keep the match balanced. In this mode you level your ships, assign upgrades and crew bonus' as well unlock higher tier ships. You can also enter your fleet into a "Custom game" Where you won't level anything (but won't have to worry about damaged ships, either) but have more freedom to choose game modes, renown limits and which race(s) you will face. I feel that this game mode is where the much requested "Co op vs ai" feature will come in to play, but as of right now, you are stuck playing alongside and against AI fleets and it's pretty pointless.\n\nThis game has the potential to be great; it may be the next Dawn of War in longevity and scope, so here is hoping. There are at least two more races to come. In time, I hope that more will be added. As it stands right now, it desperately needs the ability to invite your friends into custom games as not everyone wants to play against strangers and the AI can only last for so long. Fleets are also smaller than in the table top, from what I remember, so hopefully renown values will be extended. I have faith, however, and fully recommend this great adaptation - in my opinion, the best Games Workshop video game to be made in years.","April 25","true","28.0"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

There is another frustrating bug that still occurs from Beta, where you get a UI option over a ship to Execute a captain that is routing from the battlefield, but the button is not clickable. This occurs so often that it feels like there is a dice roll to figure out if your allowed to click it. There is also another quite annoying bug in multiplayer, where you will spend Renown to get your ships back, but quite often the connection times out forcing you to force close the game, when you get back the Renown will be spent, but your ships will still be damaged, as if you hadn't spent it.\n\nSpeaking of UI, it is quite clunky, where you have to individually place each ship down while deploying, and if you want to redeploy, you can't just drag a box around them and select where you want them to shift over to, you have to click the UI button over each the ship to tell it you want to redeploy that individual ship. Which can be frustrating when your stuck using a majority of escort ships due to most of your fleet being stuck in the warp or too damaged to fight. There is also no way to lock fleet formations, so you'll likely have ships going at different speeds towards the enemy, even if you put them in a Selection Group (Ctrl+1, 2, 3, etc), as well as have them line up in a generic horizontal line if you do a group move order anywhere, which will lead to some ships deciding to cross into each other's path, causing crashes. It can also be quite frustrating since in the campaign, they suggest that you group your small fleet close together to cover one another, but it's quite difficult to do that without a lot of unnecessary micromanagement. If you're stuck doing a Transport Escort mission, good luck trying hide them in the center of your fleet, without your fleet abandoning them.\n\nIf your ships either get lost in the warp or destroyed, or even heavily damaged and kept out for several "Turns" (they basically 1:1 used the same mechanics as the turn based campaign for the multiplayer), you'll likely just enter missions with the minimum cruisers, and as many escort ships as you can get, just to warp out before you get hit too hard. Rinsing and repeating this same tactic until your other ships are ready to battle again for a real fight. I really feel like this was a bad idea and leads to you not wanting to bother actually playing missions until you have enough of your ships returned to service.\n\nAnother issue I have is the map, you can't really zoom out too far to see the full view of the area. You have a mini map, but it seems that unidentified ships don't show up in it, so you'll have to tilt your camera to a horizon position or scroll around to see where all the enemies are constantly.\n\nThe missions themselves that I have seen so far are not too engaging.\n\nCruiser Clash: Which is just a deathmatch between your fleets, the most fun mission you'll enjoy playing in my opinion.\nTransport Escort: Which is you escorting or defending against these extremely slow and unwieldy transports, and due to not having any fleet formations, you will likely only use the same strategy of making it look like your defending your transports on one side, while you have your Transports use Running Silent to slowly move towards the end zone from the far opposite side of the map.\nAssassination: Where you must kill the enemy flagship or defend your own before they warp out, more often than not you'll be doing a Benny Hill chase (especially against Eldar and Chaos) and they'll warp out before you can get to them.\nData Recovery: It's basically boarding tag, board the defender's ship with the data, take it, then hope you can warp out before they take it back but it ends up being a chase the enemy ships and hope you can catch up, as well as have their shields down before they warp out of the area. Probably one of the more annoying missions, depending on which faction you are.\nPlanetary Assault: You have go over these timed spots to bombard the planet, or stop the enemy from going there. Good luck if you're fighting Eldar or Chaos, since they'll likely get to those bombard spots before you can get over to them, and it'll take time to actually kill them, even if you catch up, so they'll just slide right in and move to the edge of the map until next bombardment time. As defender you also start off at the edge of the map, meaning you have to get to the middle area to try and slow down the enemy ships. It would be nice if defenders had an early indicator of where the bombard zone would be, so that they could place units near there or do a ruse by putting ships in locations to fake out the enemy.\n\nI love the Warhammer 40k, as well as the tall ships in space theme and there are quite a few neat ideas but I just can't recommend it right now. It feels like it needs a lot of love to really shine, and I truly hope the devs can provide it.","April 24","false","39.7"," 59 of 109 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","59","109","3","0"

It is fun and engaging.\n\nIt however has several large issues. The only really good and fair mode to play in the game is Cruiser Clash (Deathmatch)\nThe remaining modes are all lopsided for one side to win.\nConvoy: Easy win for attackers. Destroy super squishy and super slow transports.\nData Recovery: Easy win for defender depending on faction, Start in one corner and then just run across the back of the map. Warp out, you win.\nAssassinate: Refer to Data Recovery, Except a wee bit harder since you have to blow up the enemy Flagship.\nPlanetary Assault: Defender's favor. 4 extra defense platforms plus your ships. Attacker has to split up fleet to have a hope of reaching objectives in time.\n\nLot of people complain about blockade but I honestly find that one to be pretty balanced. Platforms aren't very strong if you focus them and then just leave all but one Line ship behind and bee line for the other side. The difficulty is in breaching the enemy ships and blowing up the platforms.\n\nStay away from Multiplayer for now. Just don't do it. Bought this game and convinced my brother to buy it so we could play together. 3rd match we were paired against 2 players who brought level 9 Battlecruisers (Tier 3 ships) to the fight against our light cruisers and escorts. Needless to say we got wrecked hard.

The ship combat is fun, and maneuvering around to avoid rams and firing arcs mid fight is a pleasure. I can't really comment about balance, but to find something that works requires experimentation and maybe the patience to read through the game's wikia after playing for 10-15 hours.\n\nAs for the bugs, it's a little obscene. I've been playing 2v2 with my friend and that seems to be where the most bugs are.\n\nOne game right from the start, I couldn't see what faction one of the enemies was and it was displaying the other enemies faction as something he wasn't. When we get into the game, it still displays incorrect factions when placing our ships. We get into the game, and the fight starts off well despite me choosing poor ships for the fight. Then after the first ram or two (I play orks), my camera jumps to the far side of the battlefield and refuses to move. The game auto-capitulates for me. During all of this, my friend sees the correct factions, doesn't have the buggy camera, and sees the enemy as capitulating. I got a defeat while my friend got a victory.\n\nOther than that awkward game, I've run into two instances of fatal errors, two matches where I can't use thrust, three or four games where my friend can't use any abilities whatsoever, and two or three games where the improper factions are displayed... in 32 hours of play time.\n\nI want to like this game because I've had a lot of fun in it despite some game mechanics I've found annoying. Frequently, ships try to leave battle early and if they're destroyed, you have to play a couple games without them while they get fixed. Often, you get matched against players with higher level admirals than you, and those are usually losses. The game puts you into random game modes where the only one I've enjoyed is cruiser clash. And because of the way the factions are set up, some games and some game modes are automatic losses or wins depending on your faction. Luckily, the games are usually under ten minutes.\n\nIf the bugs were fixed, I think I could recommend this game, but it's important to know what kind of game mechanics you'll be playing with.","April 26","false","37.5"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","17","29","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/forblaze7/recommended/363680/","forblaze7","Forblaze","http://steamcommunity.com/id/forblaze7/","402 products in account","I only played the single player, but I have to imagine some amount of this translates to multiplayer as well. I was also only playing on normal, which was the second out of four or five difficulties.\n\nThis game is incredibly frustrating, at least with the imperial navy (The only playable race in single player). Every faction is notably faster than you. This would be one thing, but a large number of mission types require you to catch and either board or kill another enemy ship in an extremely small time window (2-3 minutes). In either case, the target ship will do nothing but run from you, even if they're orks. It will take well over a minute just to reach their side of the map, even with your lightest ships with all possible speed upgrades, but being able to do anything meaningful in under half of a minute is very much based on luck. If your objective is to board the target ship, you may really only have a 30% chance to succeed in the board. If you fail, you just lose. If your objective is a kill, you have very few options to deal large amounts of damage quickly. If your enemy for either of these mission types is eldar, then your chances of success are even further diminished because of the eldar ships are *many times* faster(10x? More?) than you, and any attempt at a chase is immediately obviously futile. These are only the worst examples. Any mission that isn't a straight up firefight or that can't be turned into a straight up firefight, which is most, feels heavily weighted against you. The cost of defeat is also pretty high. A heavily damaged ship takes one day to replace, which is 2-3 deployments (missions), and a destroyed ship takes two. The amount of ships you have is very limited, so every ship that gets taken out of commission for any length of time is a huge loss. Even retreating a ship before it becomes heavily damaged has a chance to have your ship become "lost in the warp" and be out for several turns. There are also further penalties for losing missions on top of the damage your fleet sustained, including lowered income, fewer available deployments, more expensive upgrades/repairs, and higher chances for your ship captains to attempt to desert.\n\nThe special campaign missions are also incredibly poorly thought out. In one mission, your objective is to escort an inquisition battleship through an asteroid field. The battleship flies exactly as fast as your cruisers, only very slightly slower than your light cruisers (188 vs 150), and is constantly using its speed boost ability. Just to keep up with the battleship, all of your effort needs to be put into keeping up with it. Any attempt to maneuver to better fight the enemy just puts you further behind the battleship. Note that weapons are very much directional. I don't think any of the ships in the imperial navy have a weapon that shoots behind your ship, so all you can do is soak up damage targeted at your weakest point. This would all be one thing, but the dialogue is constantly telling you to defeat the attackers. Again, I'm only playing on normal. The only reason that dialogue and actual gameplay would be so mismatched on a relatively low difficulty would be that the developers just didn't put any thought into how this mission actually played. The entire mission is actually a bit insulting, because the inquisitor's battleship will steamroll any of the enemy ships that get in front of it, because it's the highest tier ship in the game against the second or third lowest. The only reason any of them are a threat is because they can just sit behind him and fire with impunity. A very obvious way to fix both of these problems would be to give you control over the battleship and put a timer on the mission, then increase the tiers of some ships coming after you.\n\nIt really can't be overemphasized just how frustrating this game is. Losing is one thing, but it's just how often you feel you don't have any control over the outcome.","May 17","false","39.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I'll edit the review in a few months if the devs get their ♥♥♥♥ together by then. I'm not going to hold my breath, though.\n\n- the Admiral system is a nice quirk in the campaign, it can even be fun in skirmish/MP fights, BUT it becomes an unnecessary and annoying restriction when that is the only way you can play (there's no way to get around it and play a custom game with whatever ships you want to throw together).\n\n- the addition of 'ship abilities' to personalise and specialise ships was a very nice idea which I gladly approved off when I first learned of it in beta. As it stands, though, it's been so horribly implemented the game feels more like DotA than an actual strategy game in space. Once you're past the low levels with your Admiral, you begin facign bomb & taunt spams in almost every fight. This is about as fun as passing a kidney stone the size of a football, coated in chilli sauce and ground glass. Instead of having a game focused on maneuver, it's devolved into a clickfest. Especially when you consider that the maximum points level is 700, with most games being at 4-600 points (that's 3-4 cruisers per side - SUCH FLEET< WOW).\n\n- for some inexplicable reason the devs refuse input from the community, all the while saying how they love to communicate with us. Escorts are single ships (not squadroned) and without any limit. They gave almost all ships 5k detection range, while almost all the weapons in the game have 6k range, many of them going out to 15k (that's 2 and a half times their sight range). There is one upgrade that increases detection by 2.5k, but taking that you're gimped compared to close-range fighters who just take weapon upgrades to kill you even faster. Critical systems can be critted just like in the bgame (yay!) but for some unknown reason they can't be repaired. At all. Ever. So if you get your engines critted at the start fo the game, that's it, that ship will be a slow-as-molasses brick for the rest of the fight.\n\n- balance is crap. Eldar are the biggest community pet peeve, with their ungodly powerful pulsars in the right hands, but at the same time all their other weapons are garbage. The latest patch, called a 'major update' by the devs, has had no balance changes at all. I suspect the devs are too stubborn to let go of their special snowflake ideas such as pulsars being an activated ability rather than a regular weapon and are thus stuck in how to balance it to be good in the hands of most players rather than broken in the hands of some.\n\n- also regarding balance: all the ship upgrades, favours and skills increase ship points cost by exactly ZERO. So a ship with a whole bunch of upgrades, skills and favours will cost the enemy just as much as your freshly acquired version despite the fact that it will easily mop the floor with you.\n\nOn the positive side: the campaign, as much as I've played, seems nice and fun. Most folks I've talked to were happy with that, at least. The music is nice (but nothing extraordinary) and the graphics, as can be seen in the screenshots, are absolutely gorgeous. The UI looks good, though it works kinda clunkily, and the devs do love the universe, which can be seen even in the upgrade names and tooltips.\n\nFrankly, my only sliver of hope is that some time in the next couple of years a good mod team will pick apart this game and do it right, otherwise it will be my biggest purchasing regret since Payday 2.","May 19","false","44.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

(Let’s make it simpler: March 11) but to my horror discovered I couldn’t yet post it. Rather than writing one for the complete game, I would like to show you the old review as, obviously, the game was still incomplete:\n\n\n"A Warhammer Wonder.\n\nWhen I first heard about a potential Space-based Warhammer game, my thoughts went immediately to Homeworld, I hoped so much that this would be to that scale. Then I thought about other space games I have come across and I started dreading what this game could become if they got it wrong. They disappointed me on both.\n\nThough not to the vast scale of the original Homeworlds (though in Gothics defence I don't think anything will match that again) Battlefleet Gothic certainly did not let me down. A decent mix of resource management, strategy: both rts AND turn-based (a rare hybrid), and RP, Gothic is an amazing game where I could finally explore the entirety of the 41st Millennia’s fleets. Though only with 4 factions at the moment and not a huge selection of ships (albeit I haven't progressed too far yet), with the entire Warhammer universe behind it, there is so much more they can do in the final game, and I cannot wait.\n\nThe game at the moment is far more than it could have been it beta and could be a complete game already, had they not limited the Campaign to only a few missions *grumble* but when the final product is released, I will be more than happy to play it hour after hour, building my fleet, exploring the galaxy, and shootin' up da puny humiez......... until they introduce the Necrons of course, then I won't let it go, and you WILL be introducing the Necrons, won't you producers? WON'T YOU!!\n\nAlready a definitive yes from me, and still so much to come."\n\n\nAnd, as expected, the content since then has been just as spectacular.","April 21","true","15.1"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","18","32","0","0"

It turns every game, which otherwise might be a self contained skirmish that doesnt mean anything, into part of a larger picture where you're not just thinking about this battle but the next two or three as well.\n\nThe visuals are beautiful. I found the voice acting and characters in the single player campaign to be the most engaging of any Game Workshop computer game I've played (and I've played most of them) - striking the best balance yet between rediculous melodrama, funny moments, and swashbuckling epicness!\n\nTthe single player campaign allows you to win or lose any individual battle, giving tangible benefits or penalties for doing so, but not *too* much so (it seemed to me) always possible to continue despite constantly feeling overwhelmed in the middle part when every faction is against you. I feel like this is a massive improvement over other games where you *must* win every battle, and I really enjoyed it - I'd encourage anyone about to start the campaign to play on Iron Man mode, so there's no temptation for save scumming, the result of every battle is permanent - it really adds extra tension to each battle.\n\nThe multiplayer experience so far has been equally positive, and carries over the persistent qualities and ship leveling from the single player, which is great. The one thing I would like to see improved is to give players a multiplayer game mode where they can completely choose both their fleet (without leveling) and the mission type. A practice mode essentially.\n\nFurther development of the game is also looking awesome with Space Marine, and Tau fleets confirmed to be on the way, and a Tyranid fleet is also a future possibility.\n\nI have no hesitation in recommend people buy and play this game. Choose your faction and join the fight amoungst the stars. But remember, the Universe is a big place and, whatever happens, you will not be missed...","May 7","true","55.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

A board game with an incredible concept. If you ever played Battle Fleet Gothic table top, then you would have already bought this game. If I wrote about all things that are great with this game, you would be reading this for hours, so I will break it down into the overall concept.\n\nThere are no bases, but in between multiplayer matches, you will manage your fleet, you earn points and levels, which allow you to get more cruisers of different classes. Personally, I don't really like this system, and would prefer if you didn't have to grind to get more ships. You select which ships you bring into combat, and the mission is randomized. You have your main cruisers which are your main focus generally, and you bring along smaller frigates. These frigates lack fire power but have speed and meneuverability, they are great for scouting, getting behind the enemy cruiser where it can shoot without fear of retaliation, but another interesting purpose is intercepting ordinance. For example, an enemy cruiser just launched a bunch of assault boats to board one of your cruisers, your cruiser alone won't be able to destroy them all, and as such will take critical damage, but if you keep a frigate close, you can send it over to intercept the bombers, the turrets on the frigate will shoot them when it's close enough. The same can be done against torpedos.\n\nYour cruisers are slower, but durable, and it is so interesting the things you can do with them. In a convoy escort mission, you can use your cruisers to sit between your frigates and an enemy ship. the enemy projectiles will physically hit your durable cruiser instead of the fragile escort behind. You can use your ships to ram others, the bigger the ship relative to the ship it hit, the more damage it will deal. Imagine using a light cruiser to pit meneuver another cruiser that is chasing one of your ships. All these things are possible.\n\nThey also added an upgrade system in the game, which has some nice upgrades, and some stupid ones. Like taunt, which is just silly. there are things that help you detect and identify enemy vessels, and certain offensive weapons like bombs, and statis bombs. The latter freezes time for all the ships caught in it for 15 seconds, leaving them vulnerable to lance fire. it may seem like a long time, but you must understand, in this game, it takes several minutes to kill a cruiser, unless you absolutely muder it, catch it in a bad position and focus fire on it, then it can die in 30 seconds. Except for the Eldar which will die in 10-15.\n\nThe balance between the ships so far seem fair, with the exception of the Eldar, as of now they are too weak, because of their stupid shield design, as long as they move they take less damage, but the problem is, it doesn't prevent lighting strikes. As in a cruiser teleports a boarding party onto the enemy ship. You can't prevent that unless you get lucky, you get  in range to shoot and they will lighting strike you, no matter what you do. If you lose a sail, you lose a portion of your speed, which means your ship is screwed, it can't escape so it will die. They really need regular shields like all the other fleets\n_____________\n\nI am rambling a bit, but there is just so much to this game I can't fit it all in this review, bascially, the mechanics in this game are very unique, the game is fun, and the strategies numerous. Which people seem to have problems with. So I will name a few to help you out.\n_____________\n\nWhen fighting the Imperials Always assume they have a nova cannon in their fleet, spread your ships out as you approach. make sure they can't identify your frigates, those are easy kills for a Nova Cannon.\n\nWhen playing as Orks, make sure you have a few Launch bays, you can send boarding parties far away, weakening the enemy ships to finish off later. When fighting orks that do this, make sure you keep your frigates near your cruisers, your frigates have to intercept them.\n\nWhen playing as Eldar, the running silent order only really works with them, because they are so fast, you can have one of your ships distract an enemy, while the others stealthily move behind for a surprise attack. Also as Eldar, never cluster your ships, already spead them out, your enemies will never be able to catch them and allows you to attack at any angle if they turn their back on one of your ships.\n\nWhen defending a convey, always make sure your cruisers stay near the Transports, don't leave them with out a guard, if you do, your enemy will ram the ships which will kill them in seconds. If you keep your cruisers in the way they can't hit your transports. When doing convoy escort as Eldar, you can't keep your ships near your transports, because you can't soak fire. spread your tranports out, and have your warships hound your enemy as they persue the transports. Get behind them and shoot, they can either turn around to engage you, but then your transport gets away, or they can accept it and chase the transport as they get gunned down. It's pretty bad no matter what they do.\n\nTorpedos aren't just for damaging your opponent, they are great to deny area(cutting off escape routes, etc.). You launch many torpedo salvos in an area, your enemies can't go there now. Torpedos are really only effective if deployed in mass.","April 25","true","44.7"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

You'll have to angle the ships to get the best shot.\nYou'll have to speed up or slow down your engines to evade enemy fire or align properly for that best shot.\nYou'll have to use your skills and maybe even run away to keep your ships safe.\nCombat is pretty fast paced - it usually takes about 5-10 minutes of real time per battle.\nBut if that's too fast for you - there's always a way to slow down time to carefully think your next move through.\nIn general, it's a pretty enjoyable experience for a casual RTS player like me.\n\nTalking about the downsides - so far I'd only had a few crashes after alt+tabbing too many times. And that's about it really.

The campaign is not so much difficult as it is mean.  If you lose two battles, then you get punished by only being able to declare one battle per turn - which means the enemies gain ground twice as fast.  It's an instant death spiral, and there is no "retry" button when you lose.\n\nHey, but you're here for the multiplayer right?  That's the real reason someone wants this game - to play with their friends, or maybe competitively against random strangers, or even dream of league play.  Well, none of that is going to happen at all.   I'll list this out very specifically:\n\n1. You cannot invite a friend to a 1 vs 1 game.  Period.\n2. You can only play 2v2 against 2 random opponents if you invite a friend.\n3. You cannot ever choose who your opponents are.  So you'll never fight anybody you know.\n4. There is no comp-stomp cooperative PVE.\n5. You cannot choose what points limit of battle you're going to play - you always play maximum size for your level (which there are 8 ranks).  So, 250, 300, 450, 700, etc...  You'll always play top tier, and have no choice in it.\n6. Balance - don't even consider that the four factions will be in any semblance of "balance".  Even in the tabletop that doesn't happen.  However, GW compensates for this by letting you have 1000 points to spend and you buy units and abilities from that pool.  Overpowered things cost more, so it sorta balances out.  Here, my cruiser costs 100 points, and so does everybody else.  And it doesn't matter if I have rank 1 or rank 8 upgrades on it, still 100 points.  So, good luck with that.\n7. Multiplayer connection problems are fierce and constant.  2v2 games rarely complete without one of the four players getting dropped.  There's a particularly nasty bug where even in 1v1 you can have the camera snap to the corner of the map and none of your key or mouse inputs work - yet you're still in the game.  There's also no protection against alt-F4 logging out if you're losing either, so I never know if someone quit because I was winning or they got bugged up.\n8. If Tindalos doesn't get their act together QUICKLY then this game will be a ghost town in 2 months or less.  Look at steamcharts for the population of their previous title Stellar Impact:\n\nMonth 	        Avg. Players\nLast 30 Days 	        1.8\nApril 2016 	        1.9\nMarch 2016 	        1.8\nFebruary 2016 	1.9\nJanuary 2016 	        2.6\n\nThere is some hope here, if they fix this thing.   The player base has been 100% the nicest folks.  Everybody says "gg" after a match.  Nobody has been a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about losing or gloated about winning.  Mainly we discuss bugs, or compliment each other on a tactic that worked.  There hasn't been a lot of "cheese" since the big nerfing that went on in the first patch.\n\nLook, I don't expect that my Orks are ever going to be competitive against Eldar because they're super fast long range and I'm super slow short range, so they can just kite me all day from beyond taunt radius.  I'm fine with that, because it can be fixed in due time.  The inability to play with your friends and inability to play a match to completion due to disconnects is going to break this game's back before it has lived long enough to get fixed.\n\nTindalos still has Stellar Impact priced at $10, while it has ZERO player population.  It's not a horrible game, but even the best game is worthless if nobody is playing it.  Why aren't they wise enough to drop it to $2 or even go freemium with it and pump the population back up, and then make money on DLC?  If they're not saavy enough to see that writing on the wall, then I have zero faith they're going to do right by this title either.\n\nThe 40k license buys a lot of forgiveness about balance, because 40k never had any balance in any incarnation.  But it makes us double sensitive about quality - and you gentlemen are squandering that carelessly.  This game needed 6 more months of closed beta patching before you let it hit the street.  Now it might be too late.\n","May 1","false","16.7"," 70 of 135 people (52%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","52","70","135","4","2"

Torpedoes, ramming attacks, carrier tactics, and line tactics are all present and more.\n\nSingleplayer campaign has an XCOM vibe, and you can alter the story by winning/losing certain missions that in the lore went a specific way, essentially changing the way the Gothic War plays. Also included is a single player skirmish mode, a custom game mode, and of course multiplayer with a progression system.\n\nAll this PLUS the fact that the devs are giving out the DLC Space Marine faction they are working on right now for free to anyone who buys the game before its released (plus a mysterious second DLC).\n\nSo the sum it up we have a great game that does 40K from a good dev and publisher.

Battlefleet Gothic Armada. A game based in the Warhammer 40k ip based around the interstellar naval combat part of the universe. Based on the tabletop (kinda). Ad a 40k fan this sent me into a frenzy worthy of an ork warboss, enough to buy it in beta.\nSo let's get the good things out first. The game looks very nice. I like the design of the ships, they fit each faction fairly well and pay respect to the tabletop models. The mechanics are pretty good and keeps me on my toes trying to make sure I get torpedo strikes off at the right time and managing shields properly while making sure I don't get absolutely wasted. In multilayer I have played the imperium so far and I have to say that everything is pretty polished. The nova cannon still seems a little inaccurate for such an expensive point cost but whatever. I have yet to Crack into the campaign so I will not comment yet. There are also some bug fixes with the most recent patch that I liked as well, my imperial battleship not having all its abilities because of my mechanicus favor was annoying.\nNow unfortunately we must get into the bad. Oh boy.\nSo the fact that my friend was hard crashing constantly while trying to play 2v2 isn't good at all to start with. A little confused how that made it out of beta. Speaking of Making it out of beta it feels like a lot of this game was rushed for release. There are match ups where I can't even control my ships' abilities because the game won't let me click on them. Also who the ♥♥♥♥ thought it was a good idea to put the tactical cogitators into multiplayer? They are abused so heavily to troll people by letting the timer bleed down, and My well timed torpedo strikes keep missing because every time the enemy hears a torpedo launch he outmanuvers them in slow motion.\nSpeaking of outmanuvering, who thought it was a good idea to let Eldar kite around the map for MORE THAN 15 MINUTES WITH 2 SHIPS LEFT. Battles happen in almost a minute or so and now because the enemy is a troll I have to wait 15 minutes so that some jerkbag to realize 2 light cruisers have enough health to tank his ♥♥♥♥ longer then he can keep firing torpedoes for me to avoid.\nSo yeah the timers need to be adjusted very badly and tactical cogitators need to be removed from multiplayer. Also ships of the line need a bit of buff or the orks need a bit of a nerf because I keep seeing ork escort spam decks that are just rolling over people and no one I've played with seems to be able to help counter them.\nBasically to put all my complaints in a tldr format: Some ♥♥♥♥ made it out of beta that really shouldn't have and the game should have sat in the oven a little longer. People should not just give the game a positive rating because it's a 40k game.\nAll in all 6/10, needs improvement. I hope you can take this as a valid criticism and not a salt filled rant, as I would like to see this game improve.\n\n^^That was from my reddit post. I have a new complaint. HOW THE HELL DO YOU PLAY WITHOUT SHIPS?!  WHO THOUGHT THAT THE REPAIR TIME WAS A GOOD IDEA FOR MULTIPLAYER!? WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS DEV TEAM?! HOW IS 40K BEING HANDED OUT TO SUCH BAD DEVELOPERS?!\n\nYOu should wait to buy this game. It is not in a finished state, nor is it balanced. I'm rating this a 4/10 at best.","April 29","false","38.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I spent a lot of my time on the skirmish mode and had fun playing online as well as the campaign but my favorite part is skirmish and custom. I enjoy lvling up my fleet and how I have to earn higher point games. The random enimes are fun and the fleets are actually more diverse and the strategies are interesting and need to be thought out based on your fleets strengths and weaknesses. Auto helps to limit micromanaging in most of the factions (except the eldar that are in a league of their own.) But is not required. The story for the campaign is based on the 13th black crusade, and is so far only played from the impiriums point of view. They plan to bring out more factions and I look forward to the new additions.

It has some nice customizable options aesthetics and appearance with some RPG elements such as abilities, skills, upgrades and crew.

This game is nothing but fleet based space tactics. They resisted the urge to shoehorn in other game mechanics like so many other games do these days, and it feels great for it. No crafting systems or basebuilding or companion gathering where it feels tacked on.\n\nAnd this approach, this focus, pays off big time- that simple idea of fleet to fleet combat is executed beautifully in this game. It's easy to pick up the basics, but you can spend dozens of hours learning the intricate details of strategy here because of the depth of the combat. Ships take compartmentalized damage, various systems can be destroyed, and crews can mutiny- it's your job as a commander to figure out how to induce these problems for your enemy and how to adapt to overcome them when they happen to you.\n\nEach of the factions feels completely different from each other, both in presentation (which is beautifully true to 40k lore) and in gameplay style. The presentation of the game never ceases to impress, even the menus and GUI feel so perfect for the 40k setting, and the graphics are gorgeous.\n\nOverall, a must-buy if you're a 40k fan, and even if you don't like the setting you should give this a good hard look because it's one of the best real time tactics/strategy games in years","April 21","true","51.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I'll be brief and to the point.\n\nThis is a rather fresh concept, adequately implemented. Techically it's an Real Time Tactics game, where you field the fleet of several spaceships, which fights it out with an opponent's fleet of spaceships. The gameplay, widely speaking, consists of three major elements - building your fleet, choosing a fleet for battle, then fighting the battle.\n\nThe game is so-so for single-player, and will give you maybe 10-15 hours of SP campaign (which is essentially a series of scirmish battles in neat packaging) plus 20-30 skirmishing Vs the AI, if you enjoy that kind of thing. The AI is not very bright and as soon as you get the hang of it and learn to build your fleets properly, you will never lose a match again. That's about it with SP. The developers promise to release new fleets in addition to the existing four, so every fleet will take maybe 10-15 hours to totally max-out in the future.\nWhere BFG:A really shines however, is the multiplayer environment. The games are extremely enjoyable and live opponent far outstrips the AI. Going against other players, adjusting your fleets to the tactics and misconseptions or stereotypes, surprising the opponent with unexpected and awesome moves and choices is all the pleasure of this game.\n\nBuy it if:\nHardcore PvP gaming doesnt scare you.\nYou're ready to learn and be on the losing end while you're at it.\nYou enjoy the thrill of an intense live skirmish AND you enjoy coming prepared\nYou're just looking for a calm PvE game with not much fuss (that's what it is Vs the AI)\n\nStay away if:\nYou are really annoyed by even minor bugs and crashes (the game has it, though not a lot)\nYou hate losing to an opponent, who is stronger then you\nYou don't enjoy investing time into preparation and planning of your force\n","May 11","true","85.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Also there is a developer's roadmap in the forums, check it out if you want to see what they are planning for the future of the game.","May 9","true","33.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Excellent immersion into the Warhammer 40k universe with cutscenes that will have you roar 'For the emprorer!' as the goosebumps on your neck reach maximum goosebumpiness. The game has issues but will provide at least 20 hours of enjoyable entertainment and I reccommend it to all RTS or Warhammer 40k fans\n\nLong Version:\nThe campaign is very, very good. It extended strategic thought from individual fights to the wider campaign maps, forcing you to accept losses and priotise various resources over others whilst trying to please numerous factions and make game changing decisions. There is a clear, narrative curve, the game introduces you into world, mechanics and characters as briefly as possible, then the game throws a seemingly irreversible situation in your face. Your losses mount beyond your control and you cannot reverse this, merley stem the tide. However, the game never seems unwinnable, you are never left questioning what the point of it all is, it gives you a sense of deteremination to push on, in the name of the imperium, and hold with your every growing battlefleet and I shall mention much else for fear of spoling the experience, but the campaign is definitley the best part of the game.\n\nThe ships themselves deserve their own section. I personally love the imperiums ships (which you use exclusivbley in the campaign), they pack the weight to ram the enemy but retain the manuverability neccessary to escape botched rams or ambushes. I love the light cruiser the most because of its versatility, but the battleship is a close second, an almighty floating cathedral to the Emprorer with the guns that make heretics the universe over wet their pants at the thought of their firing (as you can tell I am now really into the universe). You also have access to upgrades, allowing you to supellement their abilities and imrpove in areas you feel require it, allowing you to create a fleet that matches your playstyle and make you think (Thats not a fleet, thats MY fleet).\n\nLevel design is mediocre at best really. The various missions presented in both the multiplayer and singleplayer are fairly basic and can easily be beaten when you work out some sort of strategy. Equally, the AI is not challenging enough at normal difficulty, it fails to prioritise targets, focus fire or keep its ships together, i felt i lost more ships to my own mistakes than enemy skill. True, its only normal difficulty, but a small spike in AI difficulty would immensley aid the sense of fear at the beginning of the game. The maps are dotted with small enviromental features which sometimes come into play (but usually don't), however the skybox (spacebox?) are always gorgeous really make you take a second look and just mutter 'wow'.\n\n\nThe multiplayer sees you creating a character within 4 possible factions:\nThe imperium (jack of all trades, master of none)\nThe Orcs (Tanky brawlers)\nChoas (long range, overwhelming firepower)\nEldar( fast moving, hardhitting)\n\nbut it is plagued by balance issues i personally feel. Certain ork setups (i.e two heavy cruisers with tractor beams) and Eldar fleets are incredibly powerful and typically ROFL stomp oppenants into submission, the choas are very difficult to play well are can often be crushed but even a comlete newbie, the Imperial Navy will generally hold its own. I should mention everything I just said in regards to multiplayer is opnion, every player will be find their most like faction, or the one they can 'work' the best, and will likley disagree with me in what I have just said. But, the multiplayer works and is fun, it in now degrades the overall package.\n\nI have probably missed some stuff but I do reccommend this game ferverntly. As an RTS fan but also a grand strategy buff, this game managed to work the shaft AND cup the balls in a way few games can, the campaign is immersive and intresting, bringing me back time and time again to push on to victory, the multiplayer isn't my thing but it rarley is. Again, if you like a good campaign, a good RTS, a good Warhammer 40K game or anything else i have mentioned, stop reading and get the game, you probably won't regret it!","May 7","true","22.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

The campaign has a so-so story but good enough mission variety, and reacts to how you're doing, so you can actually fail a mission and the story goes on, albeit it's going to have consequences. The campaign is hard, however, so don't start on a higher difficulty.\n\nGameplay takes some getting used to, but once you learn how to use the various ship types it's very fun. The sheer number of abilities and upgrades allow you to customize your fleet in a pretty significant way. The gameplay is fairly fast-paced but you can slow it down in single-player.\n\nIt does have a few bugs (such as some hiccups sometimes) and isn't that well balanced however. The campaign has a few difficulty spikes. Some mission types hugely favor one race over another; if you need to destroy or board the enemy flagship against an Eldar opponent, you're screwed since their ship is way faster than anything you have, for example.\n\nMultiplayer also has poor matchmaking. Your level 1 ships might be matched against level 5+ ones in the hands of skilled players, that will just annihilate you effortlessly.

I'll be brief and to the point.\n\nThis is a rather fresh concept, adequately implemented. Techically it's an Real Time Tactics game, where you field the fleet of several spaceships, which fights it out with an opponent's fleet of spaceships. The gameplay, widely speaking, consists of three major elements - building your fleet, choosing a fleet for battle, then fighting the battle.\n\nThe game is so-so for single-player, and will give you maybe 10-15 hours of SP campaign (which is essentially a series of scirmish battles in neat packaging) plus 20-30 skirmishing Vs the AI, if you enjoy that kind of thing. The AI is not very bright and as soon as you get the hang of it and learn to build your fleets properly, you will never lose a match again. That's about it with SP. The developers promise to release new fleets in addition to the existing four, so every fleet will take maybe 10-15 hours to totally max-out in the future.\nWhere BFG:A really shines however, is the multiplayer environment. The games are extremely enjoyable and live opponent far outstrips the AI. Going against other players, adjusting your fleets to the tactics and misconseptions or stereotypes, surprising the opponent with unexpected and awesome moves and choices is all the pleasure of this game.\n\nBuy it if:\nHardcore PvP gaming doesnt scare you.\nYou're ready to learn and be on the losing end while you're at it.\nYou enjoy the thrill of an intense live skirmish AND you enjoy coming prepared\nYou're just looking for a calm PvE game with not much fuss (that's what it is Vs the AI)\n\nStay away if:\nYou are really annoyed by even minor bugs and crashes (the game has it, though not a lot)\nYou hate losing to an opponent, who is stronger then you\nYou don't enjoy investing time into preparation and planning of your force\n","May 11","true","85.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

As for the skirmish well what can i say you can build a fleet fight another ai fleet, hard to go wrong there but again is just boring after like two games maybe.\n\nThe multiplayer- it just sucks in my opinion, if you want to start off on a admiral and get a feel for a different faction well too bad you will get your ♥♥♥ kicked by other players who have already gotten battlecruisers and your three light cruisers have no chance. I think there could be a better filtering process to play with people closer to your level and also there needs to be a more random game type process because i swear to god all i play is cruiser clash and the very rare session of convoy and thats about it. As for the gametypes there needs to be more as it just feels lacking and eventually boring.\n\nThe ships- look beautiful, cool guns and sounds and thats where it stops, there is a complete lack of variety in this game with the ships and the weapons, there definitely needs to be more ship classes and types as well not just light cruiser, cruiser, battlecruiser, battleship, i just dont find that enough ship variation in a game revolved around ships. There are like three types of guns that kind of says it all really, some obviously suck compared to others.\n\nCore gameplay- felt pretty good initially, cool new game and all and i waited quite a while for the game so there was an element of hype but the finished product (nah dont buy), it becomes boring and repetitious really quick, like within my first 8-10hours of the game I already felt bored and trust me i love these type of games so its not the genre i have a problem with its the game. Your ships are usually always clunked together, ramming is alright but not enough to redeem it. Theres a nice few little addons like skills and other things which are nice just not enough of them and you (like me) just cant be arsed getting them.\n\nTheres a load more to rant about like how it presents it as being a awe inspiring 3D movement (not all flat on a board which completely sucks and i dont care if it was based off a board game it just completely sucks out the skill or fun of the game, beings stuck on a flat surface is just soooooooo boring and showing these great battles on trailers is just wrong especially as they are utter BS) and awesome battles, but really they are boring battles with like 5 ships on your supposed FLEET (in caps because it doesnt feel like a fleet at all) and well in conclusion the whole experience is just underwhelming.\n\nIf you want a decent warhammer stratergy game get total war warhammer","June 5","false","18.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/davidboni/recommended/363680/","davidboni","Typomancer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/davidboni/","797 products in account","I’m a huge Warhammer 40K fluff fan (I read many of the books, and play the more widely appealing video games like the Dawn of War series and Space Marine/Eternal Crusade).\n\nI love RTS games, too. I’d describe Battlefleet more like a Real-time Tactics game. The singleplayer campaign has been absolutely destroying me. Haven’t even had time to touch the multiplayer. I am on Turn 6 of the campaign, which is about 10-12 missions played.\n\nYou maneuver these giant space ships on a flat plane in space. The ships are super huge, so you need to account for some kind of space physics when executing the different thrusters, whether you are dodging some area-of-effect ability thrown by the enemy ships, or trying to line up torpedoes, or even committing to a last second ram.\n\nIn the singleplayer, you can slow down time to a crawl, but it’s a binary switch, either real-time or bullet-time. I feel like it doesn’t help tremendously during certain situations unless you’re having a lot of trouble managing all the thrusters of every ship in your fleet.\n\nLaunching torpedoes feels great. Ramming stuff feels super awesome. Teleporting a strike team onto an enemy ship as its shields are down and on fire in order to prevent it from warping out is awesome.\n\nBut man, the computer opponent, even on normal difficulty, is extremely brutal. If you like challenge in your real-time tactical stuff, if you crave micromanaging of a slightly different variety than StarCraft, this is it. The computer plays to the objective ruthlessly. I had to replay a mission five times before I got it.\n\nIn one mission, I needed to teleport a strike team onto an enemy cruiser to get data, but if they took out my shields and teleported their own dudes onto my ship then they’d steal that data back. So I needed to execute a bunch of stuff flawlessly and choose my fastest and most damaging ships, or the enemy would either be able to escape, or steal back the data and then escape.\n\nIn another, I had to protect an allied, giant capital ship from getting destroyed while it was not able to move at all. I finally figured out that it could deal with most threats from its front and that I should let it do its thing while I protected its rear, sometimes throwing my own cruisers in between it and enemy torpedoes just to keep the immobile capital ship alive longer.\n\nFailing a mission also does not end the campaign. It makes the rest of the campaign harder, and probably even changes the story around. Being a tryhard like me, you can make a lot of save files to retry, but this process is not super quick, and there is no “restart mission” option in the pause menu. I feel like this kind of sucks. I know the devs sort of want you to live with your failures, but being a completely new player to this type of RTS, the friction in learning and the difficulty curve is massive enough. People will respond differently to this kind of thing.\n\nThe game’s interface is rough, and actually hard to read in some ways (text is tiny, sometimes in that really obnoxious “gothic style” font, and in some cases awkwardly cut off). I find myself using the bullet-time mode just to read various stats in the interface. There are hotkeys but you cannot rebind them.\n\nIt totally gets the WH40K stuff done very right. If you’re in for that atmosphere, look no further. All the voice-acting is over-the-top as it should be (a line from a commissar: “YOU HAVE BEEN PROMOTED TO FLEET ADMIRAL—THAT MEANS YOU’RE IN CHARGE OF THE ENTIRE FLEET!!!”), the cutscenes are almost all beautifully grim concept art pieces that are subtly animated, and the ships are intricately detailed in Unreal Engine 4.\n\nAs for performance, I was surprised to find that my Radeon HD 7870 runs the game very fine on Epic (the highest graphics setting) with the latest AMD drivers, even though my card is almost 4 years old. I was sure that it was just past the “minimum” requirements. However, before I updated my drivers, the game did crash twice on me, but not during critical moments.\n\ntl;dr Real-time tactical space naval battles are great but very hard to master even if you are coming from games like StarCraft, the Warhammer 40K setting is perfectly done, game looks gorgeous and performance is better than expected with my four years old graphics card.","April 24","true","11.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Like A LOT. It’s pretty awesome how you can have 1 ship and outfit it for so many different uses, such as a close quarters Heretic killing machine or a long range Heretic harasser.\n+The amount of detail on these ships makes the game very fun to look at especially after you beat the Heretics.\n+Custom skirmish mode which allows for you to practice the scenarios you want to such as kicking Heretic @#$ over and over again.\n+ You get to kill Heretics. ‘Nuff said.\n\nCons:\n-Ork Fanboys… that’s probably the worst thing you’d have to deal with.\n-Skirmish mode can feel a bit grindy at times. You have to play the same modes over and over again to level up to get bigger classes of ships and better modes. (At least that’s how I think it works, I never got some of the modes until I got much higher level… this could be bad luck or how it’s designed.)\n-No standalone tutorial. The campaign slowly explains things as you go. But for people who want to jump right into skirmish and multiplayer this would have been nice.\n\nTl;Dr- This game is a fun and fast RTS with matches that range from 5-20 minutes. It’s mechanics are very interesting and has a deep depth of strategy involved. It still has a skill based component of micro-management that varies between races. If you like 40k and like RTS games, I highly recommend it. If you only like one of the two, I’d recommend watching some gameplay videos before trying this out.\n","April 21","true","14.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

Now I will say this is not a game that can compete with the Dawn of war series, but it does way better than any mobile games and any other games that has been released as of late in the warhammer 40k series.

Solo skirmish is like multiplayer where instead of people you play the AI to unlock ships for both solo shirmish and custom battles.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NoxionOfMars/recommended/363680/","NoxionOfMars","Noxion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NoxionOfMars/","44 products in account","(Review as of the last day of beta)\nTindalos has delivered a marvelous gem to the gaming community. This is by far the most fun I've had playing a WH40k RTS game. I'm awful at explaining things, so heres a list of neutral facts, pros and cons.\n\nNeutral:\n-Game has a STEEP learning curve. You have to learn most of the game on your own. Prepare to lose horribly for your first 10 or so multiplayer matches.\n-Singleplayer and Multiplayer have fleet progression, up to unlocking your first battleship at level 8 for beta.\n-Your ships can be destroyed, and prevent you from using them in the next few games. This mechanic isn't so much a con in my point of view, just a mechanic to make the game less casual and more challenging\n-You gain renown (spehss monies) from matches. You spend renown on upgrading your ships and getting new ones, however renown must be spent wisely or you could suffer greatly.\n-The higher the level matches, the bigger the battles get.\n-Your ships can (and will) disobey you mid combat, attempting to flee their doom. Without the proper upgrades, this can be a huge problem.\n-Each race (Imps, Chaos, ORKZZZZZ, and Eldar) have their own playstyles, each with glaring advantages and disadvantages, enabling wild play style variations.\n-There's a good amount of objective based game modes that you will participate in other than the usual "kill everything".\n-2v2 matches with friends are supposedly going to be in full version. Awesome\n-Also a greyed out option for custom matches. Not sure what that is but may be awesome\n\nPros\n-Although only 3 missions long for beta, the campaign shows much promise with a huge map, good cutscenes and solid dialogue (No SPEHSS MAHREEN speeches froml here)\n-The combat is INTENSE. I've had a lot of buttpuckering moments that made my heart pound.\n-Plethora of customisation options for your ships such as different weapons, abilities, upgrades and favours, offering a crapton of combinations available for each ship.\n-Speaking of which, favours give your ships massive upgrades to stats, abilities and coolness factor.\n-Epic soundtrack, albeit short. Hopefully longer in the full version.\n-Each race is a lot of fun to play as. I've maxed an admiral for each race and still have a hard time figuring out which I prefer.\n-Stealth is perfectly viable if you have the patience for it.\n-Bot skirmishes for those who don't wanna play against players.\n-The community is friendly and talkative, with butthurt at a low.\n-While not in beta, theres a greyed out option to paint your ships Dawn of War style.\n-ORKZ ORKZ ORKZ ORKZ ORKZ\n-Buying the game within the first two months of release gets you a SPEHSS MAHREENS fleet and a mystery fleet for free.\n\nCons\n-Game is kinda unbalanced right now, with Eldar and Orkz seemingly smashing their way through games more often than not.\n-Being in matches with your fleet destroyed basically throws the match from the beginning.\n-New players will be put in matches against fully leveled fleets that will obliterate them. That needs to be fixed.\n-Still has a few bugs, although much MUCH better than early beta.\n\n\nOverall, my second favorite WH40k game, second only to SPEHSS MAHREEN. The game is fantastic but not without its flaws. However the flaws can be solved by Tindalos and they seem to genuinely care about the quality of their product.\n\n9.5/10","April 21","true","51.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Top notch for such a small team.\nDifficulty Curve. - The games achually hard. Easy mode should not be avoided If you're new to this type of game. Normal can be quite painful :)\n\nCons\n\nBalance issues in MP\nSome things missing from release, but being worked on as we speak (2v2 custom games, team chat, Army Painter etc) - these are cons as in my opinion they should be in the game. However. I'm achually trusting the Dev's here as sofar with this game, they've been nothing but amazing and have earnt it from me. New bits are on the way.\n\n\nThe Development team: Focus home / Tindalos Int' - These guys have made an absolute Gem of a game, that's probably going to explode into one of ther better selling game's. Its been less that one week and we've also had a Release day patch and a balance/bugfix patch. We're also Expecting a "Roadmap" For there long term plans with the game and ANOTHER balance/bugfix patch on friday (29/4) The Dev's want to looks after this game for a long long time. With access to the Games workshop IP (Yes, the company IP for BFG, that includes all Forge world covered bits too :P) They have plans for Full D/FreeLC support.\n\nI highly reccomend this game, Its going to have a long shelf life and scratch all those 40k itches you've been having. For those new to the 40k Universe a trip to WIki might be in order, but seeing my friends (who have no intrest in 40k / lore or knolege of it) Screaming "FOR THE EMPORER DIE HERATIC!" as they ram a chaos ship is just amazing.","April 28","true","379.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

The campaign is extremely repetitive in missions, with only a few custom maps here or there, and for the most part theyre boring.\n\nThe only thing driving the campaign is the dialogue in between turns, which I will admit is great dialogue. I just find myself more and more frustrated at the campaign because I may as well be playing solo skirmish.\n\nWhat prompted this edit was the emergence of special enemy ships in my campaign game. I recieved a mission that had the Terminus Est, a 10,000 year old Chaos flagship that once housed Mortarion himself.\n\nThe game doesnt say this, I just happen to be a 40k geek. This is a big deal to a 40k fan to fight this ship and actually be able to kill it. There was almost no preamble to how serious this ship is other than "it has claimed billions"\n\nThe mission it emerges in? DATA RECOVERY. I got the terminus est to 2 bars of hp and another chaos cruiser stole the data and warped out. Anticlimatic doesnt even begin to describe this epic battle I was having.\n\nI still recommend the game but only just barely. Theyre still updating it and adding more fleets, so I am yet hopeful for a better quality game. Right now it cycles through about 5 game type mini matches and tries to build the entire plot around those battles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"For 40k fans, 7/10\n\nSpace rts fans 4/10\n\n\n* Loads of micromanaging, which can be good or bad.\n\n* Ships are beautiful\n\n* Each race is unique in style\n\n* gameplay mechanics are solid, involving skill shots, ability resets, ship angles, etc. Very tactical.\n\n* ramming is a valid tactic\n\n* voice acting is very grim dark\n\n- Missions can become repetitive\n\n- Balancing still needs work\n\n- I used to enjoy comp stomps with a bunch of friends.

The point is, its not difficult, you just need to learn it.\n\nI do not play multiplayer so  i will talk about the campaign.\n\nGenerally\nIt is played in turns. In each turn you get deployment phases, where you choose which battles you will play. The battles are real in time. You get to upgrade your ships, your crew, your systems, pretty much everything. After some time, you even get to give "favour" to your ships, which means you ordain it under an imperium organization. You can have an adeptus mechanicus, or an inquisition ship. Each favour has some certain percs. By the way, all of the ships are there. From the escorts, light cruisers, to the huge battleships (and of course all their sub types).\nEvery upgrade you will do, you will do it with renown.\n\nDynamic\nThe game in general is partially dynamic. Which means that the main missions are scripted (although if you choose to replay them it will be on a different map) but the side missions are totally dynamic. The orc raids, the eldar raids, the exterminatus missions where you have to win in order to save the planet, the chaos champions vessels, all dynamic. If you loose on a main mission (or any mission) the game continues. Its not like you have to win everything.\n\nShips\nIf you loose a ship, it stays dead for two rounds unless you pay to fix it.\n\n\nLength\nThing of the campaign as a funnel. It is narrow at the beginning, and broadens slowly. At first you will think it is easy. After some turns it get bigger and then, you have a full invasion. Your mission is to stop the chaos crusade. If you play it on easy, its an average campaing. Play it on a more difficult level and you will never forget it.\n\nDifficulty\nIf you grasp the basics of the game, you can win in easy. There will be some times that you will lose of course. Yep, you can loose in this game and move forward. You can always save before a fight in order to win everywhere. My personal opinion is to play it on easy, defeat it, and then play it in a more difficult level under iron man (where you are not able to save the game wherever you want, and every ship you'll loose, you loose it for good), in order to feel how a real warhammer game is\n\n\nOverall\nIf you want a game with a good strategy, fair difficulty (if you are willing to learn) and epic battles, buy it.","April 22","true","31.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","2"

They have massively improved on balancing from the actual boardgame. Four different fleets currently, all of which play slightly differently, Imperials are slow, tanky ships that fight similar to a style from the 19th century. The Eldar are hit and run experts with deadly pulsars, torpedoes and mobility. Chaos is a little in between, with a mix of mobility, firepower and armour that does not really match either. Orks are slow, short ranged, heavy hitters with customizable ships. There are a number of game modes that keep it from being the same skirmish match again and again, data collection for instance is basically tag with battleships and boarding parties. The promise of future fleets also looks interesting, Space Marines are announced but potentially we could also expect more ships for Chaos and Imperials, a fleet for Dark Eldar, Tyranids, and Tau (two actually, the latter is by far the better one though).","April 25","true","36.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Bugs, glitches and randdom crashes happen quite frequently, ranging from the game not displaying the correct Fleet type for some players top others to a player's ships not being able to move and/or use abilities - or everyone's ships floating off into Space never  to be seen again, before the game drops everyone to the Main Menu.\n\n-there are a few (kinda mayor though) Balancing issues; for example the Eldar  Battleship "Voidstalker" - it's Pulsars rip basically everything to shreds (To be fair, Eldar have very little other tactics  at their disposal, since all the little ships seem to be made  from Cardboard)\n\n-Matchmaking in Multiplayer is a little  wonky, and you have no option to choose the type or size of the match  you're aiming for - I have been matched into 2v2 "Cruiser Clash"-type Matches with and against players, who could barely match the point range with their barely upgraded light cruisers while I could field my (almost) fully upgraded Battleship. Overall, I actually found 2v2 Matches (Although the point range is shared) far more rewarding than playing 1v1 matches - even when you get  matched with lower tier players, there's likely someone of your fleet strength range on the enemy team.\n\n-Skirmish mode is basically the same as Multiplayer against AI, limited to 1v1 matches and leveled seperately. Custom games are fun, IF you have a leveled  skirmish admiral - if not, they feel pretty much pointless right now.\n\n-The Mission types. Some missions - Specifically "Convoy", "Assassination" and "Data Recovery" are very harsh on one party. Convoy is unproportionally easy for the attacker, While for the other two, on the attacker side, Imperials are basically screwed if the enemy is Eldar, and everyone else has a hard time even getting to the other side of the map before the enemy Flagship disengages. Those modes need some work before they become really viable.\n\nWhen I take everything into account - the Singleplayer Campaign is  reputed to have some issues as well, although, thankfully, I haven't encountered any of them yet - Battlefleet Gothic: Armada had me engaged enough to overlook the mayor issues it still has, and while I do recommend it, I sincerely hope those issues will be adressed in a timely fashion, or I fear it will die off pretty quickly.","April 26","true","64.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

One of these is some of the missions can be extreemly one sided very quickly just by the line up of the opposing ships and the mission in particular. For example;\nData Recovery as the Imperium against either the Eldar or Chaos, both of which are much faster than the Imperial ships of the line.\nEldar in general are a pain to both play as and against as the micro managment required is insane, and if you happento  go against someone who has skillfully mastered this ability to micro manage then frankly, you're stuffed.\n\nPar that imo the only other issue is the ship abilities, some of which are really over powered others of which are useless.\n\nHowever despite all the "bad"  stuff about the game it makes it much more of a challenge, mix that in with a Campaign which does actually punish you for failing a mission or whatever and you've got one hell of a good game.","April 23","true","83.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

(MUHRENS coming later)\n\nIt fits in the Real Time Tactical niche alongside older games like MechCommander or Blitzkrieg, where you control small numbers of units in tactical combat and progress them over the course of a campaign (including multiplayer). Instead of mechs or WW2, however, this is essentially space naval combat, with big line ships that trade broadsides.\n\nBalance issues are to be expected in a game like this, so be careful about jumping straight into multiplayer. If the beta was any indication though, the devs are pretty good about balance patches to get things where they need to be.\n\nThat said, do expect a bit of a learning curve if you're new to this sort of game. Most strategies can be dealt with, and if you haven't learned how to deal with a particular type of enemy they can certainly seem overpowering. Ships control like... well, ships - expect them to move sluggishly, with a lot of intertia and that desperate "HARD TO PORT!" feel as you  slowly try to bring your guns to bear. Starcraft APM need not apply here, though there is nevertheless quite a bit of micromanagement.\n\nIt's addictive (especially if you like progression mechanics) and it's fun, and it's Warhammer 40,000's colossal cathedral-boats annihilating each other with gigatons of exchanged firepower.","April 21","true","46.6"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

Each turn has a set number of deloyments (each fight counts as a deployment). Although prone to repititon, you are in a constant battle to keep the gothic sector from being overwhelmed by orks, eldars and chaos. The fights remain dynamic as the enemy upgrade their ships too and bring out heavier ordinance. Even on normal diffculty you'll find yourself coming down the wire often.\n\nI've also been having crashes recently (after full release). In one situation, I lost an entire turns worth of progress since the game auto saves after each turn. Three nail biting battles gone down the drain, I have to redo that turn.\n---------------\n\nI haven't played the board game that this is based off but I'm guessing this is a lot more fun :D\n\nEach race has its own set of unique looking ships starting from transports to destroyers, light cruisers, cruisers, battlecruisers and battleships (each class a set point value).  All of them pretty and intricately designed.\n\nDepending on the kind of mission you load into (nope can't choose your missions in solo skirmish) i.e. cruiser clash, assassination, convoy escorts etc. you will be given a point cap. You will have to decide your fleet composition according to the opposing enemy race.\n\nThe battles are super fun, quick (lasting about 5 mins on average) and are visually stunning (pwetty explosions and sweet sound effects). You are expected to fight within a limited tile set or boundary (in real time) and use your races advantages to secure victory. Each race has its own specialty which allows for different play styles.\n\nHowever, some mission types favour certain races, for example, one such mission type requires a ship to approach a randomly spawned marker on the map in order to bombard the planet below. The eldar have the upper hand in such missions are they are fast and agile and difficult to catch even after using your ships abilities to slow them down.\n\nAs you win battles you can upgrade each ship class within a limited number of slots available for upgrades (passive abilities) and special orders (active abilities). You may even adopt a favour by paying renown (in-game currency earned for both wins and losses) which attaches special abilities to individual ships. One such example is the inquisition favour for the imperial fleet which grants +1 crew points to all your crewmen (yup, you will have to upgrade your crew) as well as grant you the ability to reveal an enemy ship from infinite range (which would otherwise be hidden or masked as a blip).\n\nGet the right combo going on for your fleet and you can turn those frustrating losses into wins.\n\nThe races are not so balanced in my opinion. The orks and imperials have the upper hand, i'm not very fond of the Chaos fleet, and they are average in every way. However, the eldar are super powerful (yet fragile) and are tough to catch, this can be hard to counter even with stasis bombs that slow ships.\n\nThe biggest selling point is the ship navigation. Depending on the race, your ship will have x number of prow mounted weapons (torpedos, lance cannons) and starboard & port mounted cannons. To get the most damage done, you'll have to line up your attacks in way that you would expose the most weapons at a single time towards the enemy (kind of like an old school ship battle). A combination of tactics can be used: lining up a perfect torpedo salvo (prow), a quick swing to the port side for a burst of macro gun fire followed by a frontal ship ram is extemely statisfying to pull-off when done right. You can even set up ambushes in gas clouds which will hide your ship from radar detection.\n\nI'm not sure why you can't pair up with your friends in 2v2 games as opponents (private matches). I hope they implement that soon.\n\nOther than that, expect more races, space marines are coming soon with the promise of another race (no idea which one yet, seems like necrons are getting the popular vote).\n\nTo summarise, get it, there is tons of replayablity. You'll feel like a proud father once you see your entire fleet put together, each with its own favour and colour scheme. Be prepared to get your ♥♥♥ handed in multiplayer. It ain't easy but it sure is fun.","April 21","true","32.5"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","14","26","0","0"

If you love 40K and love space battles....then you will love this.\n\nIn Battlefleet Gothic: Armada, you take command of a fleet of one of 4 races. As you do battle, your commander levels up, unlocking more ships with different abilities and loadouts. Not only does your commander have levels, but each of your ships have levels as well. Which each level, you are able to select improvements to the ship, whether it be active abilities, passive increases, or more guns! Each ship has a loadout that can be directly affected by what you choose to improve. So not only is the strategy in the battlefield, but also in fleet composition as well.\n\nNow onto the battles...This is where the game really shines. Before the battle starts, it has a Total War deployment phase. You place your ships how you want, select their firing options, optimal firing range, and start the match. When playing, the enemy ships aren’t shown, but their location is. So if you decide to head to a target and it ends up not being their flagship, you may have to watch your flank for them, because if you are caught out of position, you could be in trouble. Each of the races’ ships have different attributes and skills which changes your strategy depending on which race you are in battle with.\n\nThis is definitely a fun and challenging game!\n","April 21","true","7.0"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","15","28","0","0"

The way ships move and fight is loud and bombastic with a flair for each faction being applied well.  Watching Imperial ships blast topedoes into thier enemies hulls as they close to fire with thier broadsides is simple awesome.\n\nNote that the game plays on a flat space unlike something like Homeworld wich has a full 3d combat area.

I've probably not been this hooked on an RTS since Command and Conquer, I love the fact that a campaign fits into bite sized scenarios of 5 minutes a piece. This fits much better with my schedule these days, yet you can still binge on a bunch of missions in quick succession.\n\nI've made it to chapter two so far, in about 30 hours of play time. I suspect I've still got quite a lot more to see but even if what I've discovered is the entire depth of the game I feel like it was value for money.\n\nOverview\n\nThe structure of the single player campaign is pretty simple, you get a map showing several different systems. You start off with a couple but quickly ramp up to 5 or 6 in chapter 2.\n\nEach system has a number of planets you must defend and these planets are attacked at random by the various forces arrayed against you; Eldar, Orks, and Chaos.\n\nYou have to take randomly generated missions to reduce the threat, with most mission types being playable from the point of view of the attacker and defender.  A few examples of such missions are: a straight forwards fight to the death, stealing info by boarding a capital ship, assassinating an admiral,  running a blockade, and laying siege to a planet.\nFailing a mission generally increases the difficulty and whilst you have the short term effect of the loss of the world you were defending it also increases the likelihood of that particular foe stepping up their attacks.\n\nAlso n any given turn you also might have a story mission. Failing these have long-term effects beyond just making the game harder, so far artefacts I've rescued have proven valuable, although how valuable would be a spoiler :-)\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n\nI'd have liked the option to play as different races in the campaign, even if it was just a generic campaign without the story missions.\n\nWhat I think needs improvement:\n\nIt would be nice within the vanilla mission types if you could get a twist occasionally that changed the objectives. It'd keep this from getting too same-y.\n\nExplosions sometimes look a bit disappointing.\n\nShort range warp jumps can't position the ships on exit and seem pretty short distance.","April 30","true","61.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It gives you a very wide ability to go OCD or let the AI take command of your fleet while you focus on your flagship. The combat is very engaging and heavy in strategy, forcing you to always look at the big picture, and you cannot allow yourself to ignore even the smaller ships.\n\nAnother great feature is how widely a battle can swing with a well placed hit or an inopportune time for one of your ships to mutiny, forcing you to immediately deal with that ship else have it flee from battle. The ability to focus-fire on core targets such as weapons and engines is also a key feature that I do enjoy. Plus on the other end of the spectrum the customization of your fleet and individual ships appears very appealing.\n\nImportantly, from what little I have seen of the campaign, it seems to have a good story being built around it and seems to have a rather open-end style of growth where actions can change later outcomes, rather than a linear "on the rail" method of storytelling.\n\nThe downsides of the game is some of the matches that it has to offer, namely the defense matches. I find that the objects I have to defend never survive the battle as the AI is entirely reckless in its attempt to kill the objective, and the platforms/convoy ships have hopeless amounts of armor/HP. I find that when I play the matchups, its almost easier to just let them win so I can try a different match. This fault may ultimately be a fault in my gameplay style, but it also may be the fault in the game itself, that is for the player to decide.\n\nOverall, its a very solid space-based strategy game compared to most that is presently on the market. The only other ding I could give it is that its visuals seem a bit last-gen for the price tag, but I can live with it.","May 3","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But with caveats. Disclaimer: I've not played the game all the way through the campaign, but I have put about 30 hours into to so far with about 10 of those being on the release.\n\nIt all seems to be a very thorough adaptation of the original game. The graphics are incredibly detailed and everything is accurately reproduced from GW's original art and descriptions. I can't say that I find fault in any of the features, ships, or races. I want to like this game.\n\nBut there are problems as I see them, the game as a whole very much needs help with in-combat micro-management.\n\n1: There is no ability to set formations. If I setup a group of ships in a line formation - - - -  then they will eventually all shift to abreast as they move | | | | . If I set them up in a line formation they damn well better stay in formation or I'm shooting a captain that breaks rank. It doesn't matter if I set 6 ships 2 abreast in a line or what. They should maintain it unless I say otherwise.\n\n2: There is no ability to set 'wingmen'. I should be able to link two or more ships together that have standing orders to not drift more than, say 3000 units from one another. This is important because ships left to their own devices tend to wander off on their own, and it requires constant attention from the player to monitor and give new orders. I should be able to say to one ship, 'this ship in your lead....follow him and attack his targets always.\n\n3: Both A and B are important because while you can set priority targets the option for doing that is extremely cumbersome, and the player only has the ability to prioritize 4 targets at any given time, and you can only do it by clicking on each target one at a time. There is no 'panel' window that allows you to set them all on one pane. You can also only prioritize targets you've identified. This is kind of STUPID because if you have missions where you have to assassinate a flag ship or transports, or capture data, then the flag ship and/or the transports/data should >always< automatically be #1 and they aren't. This leads me to complain about the fact that all transports should be considered equal priority, and that would be #1 starting with the closest.\n\n4: Ships, by default, probably should never full stop on their own. This isn't to much of an issue if you're telling a ship to use it's port/starboard weapons primarily, because they will always just circle each other then, but if you tell a ship to focus on prow weapons they just come to a dead stop once they get in range. This, particularly, is a problem when playing Eldar, whose only defence is speed. Once an Eldar ship gets within range, and it's set to focus on it's prow weapons, it will just become a sitting duck and die. Bad Eldar.\n\n5: I should be able to chain movement orders. This isn't an issue (much) in combat, but if I want to pilot a transport around a minefield or asteroids, I shouldn't constantly have to go back every so often and issue new orders.\n\n\n\n\n","April 25","true","96.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It stays true enough to the general fleet play styles to stir up nostalgia while still having enough new mechanics to make it a new experience. The campaign really captures the essence of the lore included in the original blue book but gives you a limited ability to alter history. The cutscenes are great and really capture the grimdark feel of the 41st millenium.

But the PvP matching sucks. As a level 1, my friend and I ended up facing three level fours, a level five, and a level six. Losing a match does not provide a decent enough ammount to replace any destroyed ship. So you'll have to sacrifice a low level ship to try and get your good one back. So you'll end up losing another match. visuals are great, sounds are great, and the ships look awesome.

That’s not to say the multiplayer is negligible; far from it as, for many people, it’s where the real value of the game lies. It’s just that from the way the ships look, to the voice acting, sound design and cutscenes, everything is exactly how a Warhammer 40k title should be. The people over at Tindalos Interactive have done their homework, thus providing an excellent Warhammer 40k experience and the first proper 40k game we’ve had in quite a while. Furthermore, they’ve promised continued support, especially in regards to balance, which is the biggest gripe I have with the game at the moment. Knowing that a Space Marine fleet DLC is on the way and keeping in mind a particular detail from the campaign cutscenes, I’m already getting excited at potentially getting to play more races and at the thought of a possible expansion somewhere down the line. This being said, it’s pretty clear that, while there are some things that need fixing, Battlefleet Gothic: Armada is a game you don’t want to miss out on. As for me, I’m going back and painting those transport ships red in hopes of getting them to go faster.

Everything works and the story is interesting and reflect the setting of Warhammer 40,000 very well.\nMy multiplayer experience was not as well as that of the campaign. There are two reasons for that. The first is that the party system of the multiplayer has some bugs. If you change your general and/or your faction, you cannot rejoin with your former member of your party. The only thing that helps is to restart the game.\nAlso you cannot choose which kind of mission you want to play in multiplayer. It is chosen randomly. Most of the time is Cruiser Clash.\nThe last thing is balancing. I am not experienced enough to judge how balanced the different factions are. But I can judge that I am playing against players that have a lot more experience than me and therefore are able to destroy me and my teammate hard. I guess this results from a bad matchmaking system in combination with the fact that there was a multiplayer beta in which a lot of people could already train their skills in this game. I guess this problem will become more irrelevant if I play the game more, but it should not happen anyway.\nGraphics, sound and gameplay are good to very good. The setting is a matter of taste. If you like Warhammer 40,000 or dark/gothic science fiction you will like it.\nAll in all I review this game as positive, but it has some flaws, too.","April 23","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes? Then why dont you have this? Get this.\n\nOk, real review time.\n\nIssues this game has; Lack of Co-op, Simplistic AI, Multiplayer is iffy, and unintuitive.\n\nThe lack of co-op is a big hinderance on this otherwise solid game. Custome game lobbys exist where you can play vs AI, but without being able to add friends, its a rather limited feature.\n\nThe AI is quite simplistic. They use their ships skills, take into account range and some basic tactics, but ultimately they just run at you. Due to that, you can easily cheese the AI and find an win.\n\nMultiplayer is where the game seems to be aimed at for its lifespan. However, any sort of matchmaking system they use is rather unreliable. You dont know if you will get a first time player, or a person whos broken their fleet down to a science. That aside, there are a lot of reports of lag.\n\nThe game is overall unintiutive. You have to learn how to play the game, how to use the UI and just what all the little things on your ships do. Because of how the games combat system works, you dont really know a lot of whats happening. Is the next volly going to do damage? How much will it do to this target? When is its next volly? Those are all questions that are manditory, but the games system make damage a chance and you need to keep track of attacks mentally to know when the next attack will hit.\n\nBut to get more in depth about that, I'll need to get into the positives of this game. So, here they are.\n\nHigh learning curve, quick games, satisfying campaign and a good representation of Warhammer.\n\nThe high learnin curve is one of the main aspects thats good, but also bad. Going into the game from a non-Warhammer 40k fanboy, theres lots of weapons ships and names of skills and effects that will need to be learned. This can be daunting at times. However this same depth also ensures that the better you know the game, the better you will be able to perform.\n\nMatches typically last between the 5-10 min mark making its widly available. Get home from work/school, play a game or two, then get on with your life. Or you can sink in hours at a time and fully enjoy quickly learning the ins and outs of various ships and fleets.\n\nThe campaign is satisfying. Wont go into details about it for spoilers, but it clearly wasnt a patched together story.\n\nIt is the 40k universe (not really, but essentially is) and you do feel it. From the races to the "Factions" that you can have your ships represent, you can clearly see the the iconic visuals of the 40k universe. Names and skills are also very 40k, like the auto naming of your ships (that can be changed) that give them a very uniquely sounding 40k name.\n\nOverall, this is a solid 7/10. If/when co-op is added this will easily be an 8/10.","April 21","true","13.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

We have some bugs/issues/features that need to be handled. The "Not able to invite someone" as a teammate or 1v1 (at least) should be a major issue, that SHOULD of been ready at launch. This is what almost every player is going to want asap, and if it is not addressed, it will cripple multiplayer.\n\nSpeaking of multiplayer, The matchmaking is not dialed in yet, also the point to spend per match needs to get a boost or some solution like roles like BS/BC role and the support role CA/LCA. but 2v2 is weird point wise. Multiplayer needs a fix/punishment for warp out/retreat churn "matches" to fix ships while @#$%ing the other teammate in 2v2.\n\nI have had some crashes, ie; when gaining a faction for a ship and the look changes.\nI have had about 5 crash to desktop, 2 looked graphical(?), 2 were in a solo game, and 1 in matchmaker. With over 30 hours of gameplay that makes me have about one crash every 6 hours of app. up time.\n\nThey still have done a great port of the classic game IMO for solo gameplay. If you like the lore and the paradox of 8 issues and 3 actions so it is more about picking the 5 places you want to lose, and then fighting like hell to gain the three victories you can/could win, you will love it.\n\nI recommend this game if you love the 40k universe to buy it now. If you don't care about the lore, and you just want an RTS fix you should still buy it AFTER they resolve these issues.","April 21","true","36.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Traional/recommended/363680/","Traional","Traional","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Traional/","298 products in account","Battlefleet Gothic: Armada's a great Warhammer game, but not that much of a great Space RTS. Its very micro-managment and stat based, and manages to keep the feel of the tabletop game despite it being played with a mouse and keyboard. Battles are small, and usually have between 2 and 5 ships a side in a game but this actually works given the micromanagability of it; any more ships and doing the manouvres the game expects you to use would be impossible.\n\nSpace RTS wise though its not great. As I said before, battles are small. Really small, to the point your ships take up a few dots on an otherwise mostly empty map. Battles are engaging, but the combat looks visually samey. A shot form one ship will impact another ship the same way no matter where it came from. Then there's the micro management which I enjoy, but can make the game feel too complicated for a PC game. This is a game where micro management is a must (Even in the campaign), unlike other games where its an option to be used to get an upper hand on your opponent. Because of this you will lose most of your early battles, and you will rage quit far more than you'll be proud of.\n\nShould you buy this game? Only if you enjoy stat based games with a space skin. If your looking for a fun RTS buy a game like Warhammer: Dawn of War instead since you'll enjoy it far more.","April 25","true","2.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've also played both Dawn of War games and felt they superbly captured the feel of ground combat in the universe.

This game is like a fantasy come true.\n\nI'd reccomend this game to anyone who is a fan of the W40k universe or a fan of "Battleship/Combat/RTS Sims".

While it can get overwhelming at times there are many options to give your ships varying degrees of automation, giving you the proper role as admiral of the fleet.\nThe campaign has an epic feel as if you are really playing out a war. The cutscenes, of which there are many, are wonderfully done and really flesh out the atmosphere.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YellerBurdy/recommended/363680/","YellerBurdy","[C4] Yellow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YellerBurdy/","96 products in account","Ill make this short and sweet: I love this game and it can be pretty addicting. But to help with figuring out if you'd buy it or not, ill just do a giant pro/con/neutral point list and a quick conclusion.\n\nPros:\n-Unreal 4 engine\n-Warhammer 40k setting\n-Decent balancing between the races\n-Highly customizable fleets (esspecially with orks.)\n-Beautiful epic chior music\n-Very satisfying battle sounds and fantastic voice acting\n-Good option menus\n-hotkeys for abilities\n-Clear objectives on each gamemode\n-AI is compitent enough to enjoy the game (can cheat in certain gamemodes, see cons)\n-Can create your own games that will not punish your fleet in order to test strategies with randomly generated fleets or your fleets from skirmish or multiplayer mode.\n-Campagin is very well constructed and present a lot of choices\n-Option for "Ironman mode" for campagin which prevents saving for hardcore crowd\n-Easy to find a game in multiplayer\n-2v2 co-op in multiplayer\n-Tactical cogitators that put the game in slow motion and allow planning and strategy in order to keep up with the action\n-Dev team plans to add more content and new races (space marines will be dlc in 1 1/2 months and then another race that hasn't been announced is planned sometime after)\n\nCons:\n-Certain races need particular ship upgrades and weapons to defeat other races (Ex: Chaos will kite your ships with long range weapons while they move at fast speeds which make them difficult to catch if you do not have nova cannons, upgrades to increase the range of your weapons, ordinance bay, or long range lances.)\n-Races will have natural disadvantages that can ruin a playstyle for certain players (Ex: Eldar will be extremely fast and manuverable, but will usually be blown up if looked at the wrong way due to their fragility.)\n-Insubordination is a thing, and your ships will try to disengage a fight. You can execute them, but it causes stacks of mutany which make them ineffective the more you execute people on that ship. (With orks, however, you need an upgrade to execute them, and if you do not have it they will leave the fight and there is nothing you can do about it. Whats worse with orks is that it can cause other ships to be insuborinate. This means you could lose an entire fight because your battleship saw your escort get destoryed and decided to run which caused your entire fleet to run away one by one.)\n-In Campaign, Skirmish, and Multiplayer, it is possible to be locked out of your fleet if you lose all your ships and are unable to repair them with renown. Leading to having to delete your admiral and create a new one. (granted, this is rather difficult to do as ships repair themselves after 1-2 games depending on how damaged they are, and making new admirals is not as punishing as it seems unless you are doing the campagin.)\n-Certain gamemodes are annoying to a majority of the players since they revolve around running away from your enemy and warping out of the battle, which slower races are at extreme disadvantages vs faster more manuerverable races.\n-AI cheats often in gamemodes which involve evading opponents (Ex: In assasination, you could destroy the enemy ship right before it warps out and watch it explode, but it will still count it as a defeat, this may be more of a glitch though)\n-Multiplayer matchmaking is imbalanced and will usually pit a fresh new admiral vs high level admirals with various upgrades.\n-Tatical Cogitators can be activated in multiplayer, which can be fairly annoying if your game goes into slow motion randomly.\n-Tutorial is shown in the campaign prologue, so in order to start learning how to play, you must start the campagin, less you blindly walk into a match.\n\nNeutral (pros and cons depends on the person):\n-Stays true to the tabletop, meaning that boarding, lightning strikes, critical damage, ect are based off % rolls and can be entirely random. However, it can be influnced to decrease negative outcomes (Ex: increasing your crew of troops will increase your troop value, which reduces the chance of the enemy successfully boarding you. 70 troop value means 70% chance the enemy will fail.)\n-Campagin is high stress, as it will force you to play imperial navy and defend several solar systems in multiple sections of the gothic sector, which can be overwhelmed very quickly with orks, eldar, and chaos attacking all the time. Worse: planets can be destroyed if you do not respond to them in time  via Extermanatus or Abbadon's Planet Killer	. It is basically the "Everything is falling apart around me" simulator (which is extremely accurate to the imperium of man's lore.)\n\n\nOverall, a very good experience for me, but it can be addicting and difficult to put down. The game is relatively forgiving to admirals who take care of their ships even in games they lose, but can be very harsh if you have your ships gain heavy damage or flat out destroyed. The main con of the game to a majority of the community is that some of the gamemodes are extremely frustrating to play. The game has a bright future though, and it is easy to get into as hardcore and casual players (avoid multiplayer if you plan to play this casually, as you will not survive.)\n\nAnd remember: hit the red button.","April 29","true","106.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xether86/recommended/363680/","xether86","Xether","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xether86/","273 products in account","Just completed the Campaign and have spent 60 hours in the beta doing Skirmish and Muti so i thought it be a good time to give a review.\n\nFirstly the graphics look fantastic and the game runs very well on my rather average PC. All the ships look just how they do in table top. The imperial ships look so beautiful with all the tall spires and cathedrals. The map designs look gorgeous with planets, suns, asteroid fields, ice crystals and my fav being the blackhole map that reminds me so much of the movie intersellar. I've experienced 2 crashes in my 85 hours of playthrough and both instances happened during the beta so im happy that they have dealt with the little problem.\n\nSecondly the campaign is brilliant. I think the voice actors done a very good job and speak in the way you expect people in the 40k universe to speak. The campaign was long and took me just over 40 turns to do but every turn had some form of speech by someone of some incident happening or some big bad coming into the system. The cinematics are truely awesome and really keep close to the lore. i really love the art design and music with chapter 2 "entering the warp" scene where the crew are praying being a masterpiece.\n\nI did the campaign on normal and i can say its just about the right difficulty (For someone like me that likes hard games) any higher and i could see myself throwing the mouse or keyboard at the wall mainly due to how random the campaign can be. The problem being is that every time you replay and load the same mission your enemy will have a completely different set up and be in completely different location on a completely different map (asteroids, mines and gas being in different locations). This can pretty much make you win or lose automaticly depending on the mission and it can be incredibly annoying when everything is stacked against you because of the RNG. All you can do is restart and load the mission up. This really is the only bad thing i can say about the game. Hell, i even lost the first mission because the first shot the defence platform did after the shields went down critical hitted me and took my generator offline and then took double the time to warp out as abaddons 100 ships slapped me down hard.\n\nThirdly the balance of skirmish and multi is completely fine. For those of you who were not in the beta you have no idea how bad it was back then. You had Eldar Holofields that worked even better then they do now.  You had insanely OP Assault boats that at the time made Chaos the go to race. You had insanely OP Taunt that was auto win when playing Orks. You had Nova Cannon that didn't even show up on the map and fired alot faster. There was alot of things that have been sorted out and balanced and right now things are pretty much good. Some work probably has to be done on Eldar but for everyone else it is near enough perfect. Literally all it comes down to is "Git Gud" for the most part.\n\nThe Micro in the game is perfect balance of not requiring to be a korean SC2 God and good enough that the game isn't a "a" and left click game. You can choose all the options that you want the computer to do for you by right clicking on all the skills you don't want to personally control yourself. Boarding and lightning strikes is usually a good one to do for new players. Ships are very slow even as Eldar so i can say that game is rather slow paced and not that many ships you have plenty of time to do all your skills and planning. If the game is still to micro intense for you? Just press space bar and it slows the game right down for everyone. There is literally no way i can see people complain about micro in this game. The only theory i have is that they are LOL kiddies that are so use to playing just 1 character with 4 abilities that when they come to a game where you have control 3-4 "characters" they instantly get anal prolapse.\n\n8.5/10 - Campaign battle balance rather off as its pure RNG. Alliance battles and data collecting are awful. If you get Both in the same battle.. Pray to the Emperor. Tiny bit of race balancing needs work. Other then that a brilliant game. A must buy if you love the 40k universe. You won't be dissapointed. Can't wait for the space marine DLC.","April 29","true","86.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

We have some bugs/issues/features that need to be handled. The "Not able to invite someone" as a teammate or 1v1 (at least) should be a major issue, that SHOULD of been ready at launch. This is what almost every player is going to want asap, and if it is not addressed, it will cripple multiplayer.\n\nSpeaking of multiplayer, The matchmaking is not dialed in yet, also the point to spend per match needs to get a boost or some solution like roles like BS/BC role and the support role CA/LCA. but 2v2 is weird point wise. Multiplayer needs a fix/punishment for warp out/retreat churn "matches" to fix ships while @#$%ing the other teammate in 2v2.\n\nI have had some crashes, ie; when gaining a faction for a ship and the look changes.\nI have had about 5 crash to desktop, 2 looked graphical(?), 2 were in a solo game, and 1 in matchmaker. With over 30 hours of gameplay that makes me have about one crash every 6 hours of app. up time.\n\nThey still have done a great port of the classic game IMO for solo gameplay. If you like the lore and the paradox of 8 issues and 3 actions so it is more about picking the 5 places you want to lose, and then fighting like hell to gain the three victories you can/could win, you will love it.\n\nI recommend this game if you love the 40k universe to buy it now. If you don't care about the lore, and you just want an RTS fix you should still buy it AFTER they resolve these issues.","April 21","true","36.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So I am only reviewing that..\nI will get to the bad stuff first At the moment the Eldar are really OP, so if you are playing any other faction you should probably surrender every time you face them so you can save your ships. Seriously they have weapons that can kill any ship in 2-3 hits. But I expect that will all get fixed soon and the game will be much better for it. There are a few other bugs, but they are constatnly fixing them. However, other bugs seem to pop up as they fix old ones. But they do seem to be less bad each time. The other thing that gets a bit boring is the lack of factions to choose from. With eldar being so crazily OP, there are only really 3 fun factions and not 4. It isn't even fun to play as Eldar, waaaaay to easy unless you against other Eldar.\n\nNow on to the good stuff. The ship customisation is pretty fun. You don't get completely free control over your ship customisation like it says in the description, but it is good enough. The graphics are awesome but I have to run low otherwise my FPS drops, but thats just my setup. The audio and music is awesome, really atmospheric and very nihilistic. Some people say there isn't much strategy in this game, or that it is confusing. I think they couldn't be more wrong. There is a lot of skill to be learned in this game, making it fun and very replayable. Overall I would recommend this game, but not to anyone that doesn't like strategy games. If you don't learn from your mistakes you will keep losing your ships and it will get very annoying. (But you never lose ur ships for good.) :D\n","May 13","true","111.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Maybe I'm slow, but who cares, the story is pure WH40K goodness and almost every mission in the single player campaign has left me cheering at the end when I win. Plus the defeats hurt deeply, which just makes the wins that much better.\n\nEven watching some let's play videos on youtube have gotten me excited at the close wins.

I would not recommend the game for its singleplayer campaign alone due to reasons I am about to explain, however I can under no circumstances give this game a thumbs down due to my own gameplay limitations.\n\nThe Warhammer 40K vibe is definately present in the game as far as the story goes and it is presented well, however it is the gameplay that detracts from my enjoyment of the campaign.\n\nThis is a space game and you get a limited amount of vessels within each category to customise with certain skillsets. These skillsets are bought with honor points your earn throughout the missions on the campaign, however these skillsets quickly narrow down the strategical options due to specialisation, be it brawling by using ramming or long ranged weaponry. You dont build bases, you dont get reinforcements in battles and you are stuck with a limited number of vessels which you better know how to handle, the campaign story missions can be very unforgiving and thus the specialisation needs, you really need to know your fleets capabilities. Its extremely easy to fall into a certain rotation if it works, improvisation is better left for the easier missions.\n\nBe it defensively or in offense I find myself doing the same over and over with a limited number of ships. This could be due to self imposed restrictions based on my personal skill level. If you buy the game for the campaign alone I would only recommend it at a cheaper price.\n\nMultiplayer offers many more choices and human opponents, it most likely offers a very different game experience, for that I would recommend the other reviews on the game or youtube.","April 23","true","6.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In many ways it reminds me of XCOM where it creates difficult situations in which you cant save every planet. Not to mention the "Iron Mode" setting making any ships you lose unable to be repaired. This really creates what feels like an intense multi-front war for survival. Complaints about high difficulty even on low difficulty settings are largely exaggerated. I suspect many people aren't taking advantage of various mechanics (not to mention the fact that you can save and retry as many times as you like).\n\nMicro Management - I was somewhat concerned about this, as there are so many abilities across your fleet. I have yet to run into any real intense micro management due to the games "Tactical Cogitator" mechanic that allows you to slow the game down to very near a stand still, allowing you to aim skill shots and target abilities with ease. This in combination with auto-cast functionality on pretty much every skill (things like silent running and "Micro-warp Jump" aka blink don't seem to auto cast), an auto target option so your ship will always attack something even if not commanded to, and various other behavioral settings, make micro management minimal.

As a grand strategy fan I would have wished for more strategic play, but I understand the standards of RTS. The fleets are very different and you have to learn how to use them. That is something very remarkable for the current market of RTSes, where in multiplayer even when there are different races and units, they are mechanically similar. It is not as much variable as Starcraft, but nevertheless. In the department of art and design and gameplay, this game really shines. The opinion on customisation and RPG elements is a subjective one, I think it is a good idea to implement it in an RTS, Im okay with it, I liked it in King Arthur and like it now, I dont mind that it is like a battle between wizards.

It is also valid to point out that there is a lot of micro-management in the more chaotic battles and the grind for skirmish and multiplayer is a little bit too time-consuming. I would reduce the time to get to the full admiral in skirmish and multiplayer and give players more tactical cogitator debit in multiplayer. And the upgrades are a little bit unbalanced. In the crew department, the navigator could have a turning bonus and the boarding mechanic is I think overpowered, so that I always pick upgrading the troop level. I always go for the disruption bomb and the recon skills are pretty unattractive. I personally think, the stasis bomb is useless unless you are fighting against a dumb enemy or the Orks and the only use of it is in catching some coward in breakthrough, data retrieval and assassination, who you cant overrun because of the different speeds of the fleets.

I would not recommend the game for its singleplayer campaign alone due to reasons I am about to explain, however I can under no circumstances give this game a thumbs down due to my own gameplay limitations.\n\nThe Warhammer 40K vibe is definately present in the game as far as the story goes and it is presented well, however it is the gameplay that detracts from my enjoyment of the campaign.\n\nThis is a space game and you get a limited amount of vessels within each category to customise with certain skillsets. These skillsets are bought with honor points your earn throughout the missions on the campaign, however these skillsets quickly narrow down the strategical options due to specialisation, be it brawling by using ramming or long ranged weaponry. You dont build bases, you dont get reinforcements in battles and you are stuck with a limited number of vessels which you better know how to handle, the campaign story missions can be very unforgiving and thus the specialisation needs, you really need to know your fleets capabilities. Its extremely easy to fall into a certain rotation if it works, improvisation is better left for the easier missions.\n\nBe it defensively or in offense I find myself doing the same over and over with a limited number of ships. This could be due to self imposed restrictions based on my personal skill level. If you buy the game for the campaign alone I would only recommend it at a cheaper price.\n\nMultiplayer offers many more choices and human opponents, it most likely offers a very different game experience, for that I would recommend the other reviews on the game or youtube.","April 23","true","6.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In many ways it reminds me of XCOM where it creates difficult situations in which you cant save every planet. Not to mention the "Iron Mode" setting making any ships you lose unable to be repaired. This really creates what feels like an intense multi-front war for survival. Complaints about high difficulty even on low difficulty settings are largely exaggerated. I suspect many people aren't taking advantage of various mechanics (not to mention the fact that you can save and retry as many times as you like).\n\nMicro Management - I was somewhat concerned about this, as there are so many abilities across your fleet. I have yet to run into any real intense micro management due to the games "Tactical Cogitator" mechanic that allows you to slow the game down to very near a stand still, allowing you to aim skill shots and target abilities with ease. This in combination with auto-cast functionality on pretty much every skill (things like silent running and "Micro-warp Jump" aka blink don't seem to auto cast), an auto target option so your ship will always attack something even if not commanded to, and various other behavioral settings, make micro management minimal. I suspect many people complaining about this being an issue are again not taking advantage of many of these mechanics.\n\nMultiplayer - Is a blast. Plain and simple. With the variety of skills, passives, and traits (have to admit I love the Chaos's Nurgle trait and its death rot cloud!)

Battles can turn around in fantastic ways in your favor with quick thinking and knowledge of your ships.\n+Story line is involved and keeps your attention.\n+Even how epic the battles can be they are never TOO terribly long (depending on the mission) Which makes for a great time killer if you only have a little bit to spare for the Emperor.\n\n\n-Weird load times opening the game?\n-Can be an incredibally hard game, but this could be a positive on some notes.

This game has been beautifully rendered by the devs, its still got some work to do but as far as RTS gies this is a really great title another 40K hit, i reccomend it to anyone who enjoys space battle, navy battle and game requiering thought and tactics to win.

I'm glad to say that the tone of the game is very true to the dark 40k universe, and in particular the well documented struggle in the Gothic Sector. The portaits, voices and attitudes of the characters are some of the best I've seen for a 40k game.\n\nThe single player campaign appears well balanced, missions are hard and mistakes are punished. Upgrading and deploying ships is a joy, which adds an RPG element to the game. You'll find yourself caring about ships under your command in the interesting and varied battles. Ships can be customised for particular roles as well.\n\nCombat itself is a lot of fun. After the first few struggles you'll begin to get the hang of handling the fleet. Having a genuine tactic appears to pay off, which is nice. Some missions may seem impossible until you hit on the correct tactic.\n\nGraphically the game is beautiful. You don't quite get the sense that the ships are as big as they are however. Probably because you'll be zoomed out a wee bit most of the time.\n\nIf you like strategy games or 40k, this is a must.","April 22","true","29.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game, in my opinion, should have spent a little more time in development, Example of why: In one of the very first trailers, it states that you can warp out, repair the ship, then warp back in to continue fighting, this ability has yet to be shown. It still has bugs, but are getting sorted out as the go along, and the only down side as an early adopter, still no space marine fleet, which they worded incorrectly, (like GW itself does occasionaly,) implying it would be a few weeks, (By definition 2 or 3 weeks) but it has been one month and 2 weeks (This was posted on june 3rd). It also implied that the early adopter would recieve it before the non early adopters. P.S., if any staff read this, please reccomend the space wolves as a favor for the space marines, as they have the largest known fleet of all space marines chapters, please do not act like Matt Ward with Ultramarines and make them overpowerd if you make them a favor (PLEASE DON'T USE THEM, they dont really like many ships or big ships any ways).","June 3","true","227.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slavemaster/recommended/363680/","slavemaster","slavemaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slavemaster/","270 products in account","I had a really tough time thinking, should I leave a positive or a negative review. As you see, I chose to make it positive, but it is a really cautious recomendation, and to make it more clear, I will start from a negative part of the game.\n\nCons:\n-First of all, the game is nothing more but a beta. It has bugs, it has lags, servers cant handle their job and go offline, and finally, the game simply crashes. Not to mention such funny stuff as random controls problems, that prevent you from moving or using any skills, which is bad on its own, but is even worse cause of "hangar multiplayer lobbies".\n-Apart from bugs I want to mention heavy balance issues. While many old players (or the ones, who are good at such type of games) figured how to win regardless of situation, some newer and less hardcore ones really suffer from said balance. Some missions for some factions may be a real nightmare (convoy defence is the most problematic for new players, who get killed in 2 minutes with no chances of survival), some races can just outdamage you in first seconds of combat (pulsar eldar is a bit too good).\n-Somewhat linked to the previous issue, ship variety. The game has "hangar" where you manage your fleet, from which you select ship to fight a battle. So what is the problem here? Well, first, you have a VERY limited number of active vessels per class. Second, some of said "classes" have only one option of vessel to select from (hello orks and eldar), others have a situation where you either select one good option, or pick any other and get  a much worse one (that is for chaos and imperium). Pluss, I must mention that not all options were brought here from tabletop, so it really limits you, if you want to get your fleet from tabletop on a new playground.\n\nPros:\n-Spirit of the game. Yes, it is 100% WH 40k. It is pure "grim dark future". And if you are into it, as I am myself, you will find yourself roleplaying with your enemies, accusing each other in heresy, following the false God-Emperor, being a primitive creature or simply yelling WAAAAAAAAAAAAGH on top of your lungs. After some other games, after dull insults or simple "gl hf" such a great start of each combat gives this game 100 bonus points in my eyes.\n-Each faction has its own unique playstyle and personality. Want to implement hit'n'run tactics? Eldar are waiting for you. Want to endure every single battle and defeat your enemies with an ocean of pathos? Imperium of Man stands storng! Want to go rebelious against the system? Chaos is that. Want to laugh maniacally and ram into enemies with guns blazing? DA BOYZ ARE HERE!\n-Progression system feels really great. You gather your power, customize each vessel to do the job you want it to do, get levels, skills, gear and crew, recover them from half-dead state. While it has some issues and can kinda limit you, it also allows you not only to win in combat itself, but actually make this win much easier by carefull preparation and planning.\n-Single campain seems to be pretty close to the official back, pluss it adds up even more strategical depth in planning your battles.\n-It looks and sounds really great.\n\n\nTL;DR version/summary: the game has its issues and they can be even a bit gamebreaking right now, but even now the feel about the game, fun and euphoria from gameplay are enough for me to recommend it. And if the developer fixes all the problems and gets even more content they already promissed, the game will be my GOTY candidate.","April 23","true","51.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I must say I'm very, very pleased about what I've bough, and I highly recommend it not only to every fan of Warhammer 40,000, but to anyone who likes tactical RTS games, naval games, spaceship games, and sci-fi in general. Let me list the reasons.\n\n- A great port of the tabletop game to the RTS genre. It is highly based on the rules of the original game, namely ship positioning, fire arcs, manouvering, space hazards, special orders... while at the same time adding new functionalities.\n\n- A beautiful depiction of the inmensely rich Warhammer 40,000 universe. Attention to detail is everywhere: descriptions, UI, voice quotes... It represents the setting as no game has done since the original Dawn of War, about 10 years ago.\n\n- Graphics and sound are just impressive. You will see shields rippling from impacts, chunks flying off hulls, destroyed parts of the ships' hulls (which also means losing equipment on the ships: yes, you can target specific ship systems), gorgeous space landscapes, boarding parties boring into ships...\n\n- Gameplay is deep and can be quite competitive. Make no mistake: this is a Tactical RTS game, which means lots of micromanagement, and where each ships' position and orientation is key, not to mention the abilities. It takes some time to learn, but it's quite intuitive once you do. Also, by pressing spacebar, you can slow down the game's pace to a crawl, which can help you to react to very complex situations if you need it. This feature is also available in Multiplayer, although with a time restriction to avoid trolling.\n\n- The single-player campaign is lengthy and rich as well. You will have to defend a whole sector (star cluster) against several enemies: the Chaos forces, local rebellions, and Ork and Eldar pirate attacks. You decisions will matter. Those players who prefer playing campaigns over MP will enjoy it a lot.\n\n- Both in SP and MP you will be the admiral of a fleet. There is a progression system: you start as a lowly new admiral, but as you earn renown, you will get more ships and upgrades for your ships. You won't lose ships permanently (unless in super-hard mode in the campaign), but destroyed ships will not be available for 2 games unless spending points on priority repairs. Personally I like this mechanic, as it forces you to think like an admiral. Is it worth losing your entire fleet if the enemy overwhelms you? No! Better warp out: you will earn points by losing as well. This also means you should carefully select your upgrades, and which ships to bring to each battle depending on the objectives. It encourages tactical thinking, and I appreciate that.\n\n- The support the developers (and even the publishers!) have given to their game during the Beta stage (and before that)  has been enormous. They have worked really hard to make the game as good as possible for release. They've listened to the players' issues, both technical and of gameplay, and have updated the game many times before release. Such dedication to their playerbase and the game they've created is much respectable, and something sadly unusual these days. Rest assured that their support will continue: in their own words, "release is not the end, but the beginning". They will be adding more races and factions from the W40k universe via DLCs, and I'd say they also want to add more campagins.\n\n- To continue the previous point, just have a look at the Early Adopters program. By buying the game within 2 moths after release (or having pre-ordered it), you will get the 2 first faction DLCs (Space Marines and a yet-unveiled 6th faction) for FREE once they are released. How cool is that?! Oh and by the way...\n\n- ... that 6th faction was not originally devised to be free too. It was once the devs/publishers realised they couldn't meet the original release date (March 23rd) without releasing a half-baked game. So they swallowed up and postponed release a month later, extending the Early Adopters program to the 6th faction as well. How many game developers of today would do that? How many would see it would be better to push back release to improve the game? I say, only a few.\n\nSo that's it for my review, for now. Again I say: I highly recommend this game.\n\nNOTE: make sure you buy the game either on Steam or at the official webpage. Some people are having issues with being elligible to the Early Adopters rewards when buying from 3rd party websites like GMG. If you want to buy it from those, make sure they do include those rewards before buying!\n\nNOTE 2: if you want to play with friends (via invite) or place custom paintjobs on your ships, those two features will soon be added to the game. As far as I know, they're now focused on delivering them as soon as possible. If those are critical features for you, I would advise waiting until they are added before buying. Given the devs' previous records with this game, I would expect a relevant patch within a week.","April 22","true","49.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I must say I'm very, very pleased about what I've bough, and I highly recommend it not only to every fan of Warhammer 40,000, but to anyone who likes tactical RTS games, naval games, spaceship games, and sci-fi in general. Let me list the reasons.\n\n- A great port of the tabletop game to the RTS genre. It is highly based on the rules of the original game, namely ship positioning, fire arcs, manouvering, space hazards, special orders... while at the same time adding new functionalities.\n\n- A beautiful depiction of the inmensely rich Warhammer 40,000 universe. Attention to detail is everywhere: descriptions, UI, voice quotes... It represents the setting as no game has done since the original Dawn of War, about 10 years ago.\n\n- Graphics and sound are just impressive. You will see shields rippling from impacts, chunks flying off hulls, destroyed parts of the ships' hulls (which also means losing equipment on the ships: yes, you can target specific ship systems), gorgeous space landscapes, boarding parties boring into ships...\n\n- Gameplay is deep and can be quite competitive. Make no mistake: this is a Tactical RTS game, which means lots of micromanagement, and where each ships' position and orientation is key, not to mention the abilities.

The game has very lovely graphics and great looking ships currently for four races, the Imperium, the Orks, the Eldar, and the Chaos. Each race has a large selection of ships to use in many different sizes with many different weapons. Each race plays different such as the Eldar are focussed more on speed and the Chaos has a focus on long ranged ships. The devs have confirmed more teams such as the Space Marines which will be added soon.

That said its not like Homeworld, but more like Nexus: The Jupiter Incident. No base building, just managing your fleet mission to mission.\n\ngraphics: Game is very pretty and ship models are very well done.\n\nGameplay: While there is a learning curve, anyone can get the hang of it with enough practice. I have found that the auto use feature is a must for skills. Helps out hugely on the mirco so you just have to worry about torpedoes and nova cannons. There is a decent amount of grinding in order to lvl up your admiral and ships, but battles are pretty fast, so you can get to battleships pretty quickly. For now, we can only use 4-6 ships per battle, so we don't get overwhelmed trying to control so many ships and all their abilities and skills.\n\nCampaign: If you played Dawn of War 2 and enjoyed it, you will enjoy this. Similar mission structure with a limited amoutn of deployment per turn, making us choose what benefits we want to keep. I have yet to finish the campaign, but I have been enjoying it immensely.\n\nSkirmish: Here we get to try out all 4 fleets (for now) against the AI. AI is decent to play againts and will provide a decent enough challange on normal.\n\nMultiplayer: Can't say anything here, I generally don't play online.\n\nOverall its a fun game. Some features are still missing, but the devs have been putting out huge patches every single week since the beta started fixing bugs and tweaking the balance. We have 2 new fleets incoming in the next few months, so I see plenty of future support and content from the devs. So give this game a chance. It might be difficult at first, but once you get past the learning curve, its tons of fun.","April 22","true","68.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Unlike so many recent RTS games the AI will beat you! I have lost a number of missions on the harder difficulty settings. Instead of this resulting in a game over and thus encouraging 'save scumming' the story line evolves, building your defeat into the narrative and leading to a more nuanced and engaging single player experience. While the story line itself isnt going to win any oscars, and the twists can be a bit telegraphed the way in which it incorporates your defeats makes up for this.\n\nThe battles themselves are smaller, personal affairs - think company of heros but with spaceship. With you controlling from 2 - 6 ships in fast paced, ship to ship engagements where facing, positioning and appropirate use of abilities is key. An active "pause" button allows you to slow down time both in single player and mutliplayer ensuring that players of all abilities have the time to effectively micro (and also to appriciative the graphics and explosions).\n\nMultiplayer involves 4 races that each play very differently. Everyone will find a race that appeals to their play styles but you will need to be adaptably as there is always a race that will hard counter your advantages - so adaptability is key. Games last from 3 - 10 minutes, with a hard 20 min time limit. Mission structures are a little hit and miss, particularly convoy missions that involve transport defence BUT this is NOT an e-sport. Games are short, you can easily get in 10 in an hour. Much like a game like hearthstone, you will lose just as regularly as you win but the fast pace and short game time negates any hard feelings.\n\nBalance is being continuely worked on - with patches in the BETA coming regularly.\n\nWhile the game is a great stand alone product - providing hours of enjoyment (30 hours and still going for me) I am most excited for its post launch dlc and potenial as a platform for further expansion.\n\nThe introduction of new fleets, the potenial for extended single player campaigns, the potenial for an army painter introduction. All these offer exciting opportunities to extend the life of this game. While only the former is confirmed this game has a huge ammount of potenial for further development. More importantly none of these things are currently in the game and hidden behind a pay wall. It is clear that the developer is actively working on expanding the experience post launch and for this reason I would be happy to pay for DLC to cover the costs for the time and effort in creating these. UNLIKE WARHAMMER TOTAL WAR where races are being INTENTIONALLY locked off despite being in the game! The only pity is that mod support is not inbuilt - think Xcom 1 rather than Xcom 2.\n\nMy advice - buy it and try it. The game provides both bite sized RTS single / multiplayer missions for when you only have 30 minutes to spare AND a lengthy single player campaign / mutiplayer ship development for those with more time.\n\nAnyway enough typing - I am off to play and forge a narrative for my mutiplayer fleet.

Stopped Traitor ship from escaping through the warp like a little ♥♥♥♥♥ and destroyed him.\n\n11/10 would destroy traitors again.\n\nSerious ReviewThe game is actually a really good RTS.  Runs fine on my 750ti and AMDFX6300 at Epic settings. The ships themselves are really well made, although I feel the textures aren't as good as what I saw in the preview videos on YouTube.\n\nI'm enjoying the campaign, it feels like an actual campaign and not just something tacked on. I also like how some missions are designed to have you be defeated which is great as lets be honest we've had far too many campaigns in games where you win every battle.\n\nGreat thing though is that defeat doesn't end the campaign nor does it make you restart the battle.  The campaign continues regardless.\n\nVictory however is really well rewarded.  You can get upgrades for your ships, favours from different factions which gives ships different bonuses, abilities and awesome paint jobs.\n\nIn short the campaign is probably one of the best I've played in a long time.  One thing I would have liked to have seen is a campaign for different races as not everyone is a fan of the imperial navy.\n\nIn terms of gameplay its a solid and complex RTS. I don't want to cover everything here, but lets just say you have a lot of control over how your fleet moves, how and what it attacks and so on. This is the first time I've seen an RTS have mechanics like this and they are a welcomed addition and I hope other RTS games implement these types of mechanics.\n\nOverallBattlefleet Gothic Armarda is a solid RTS with robust mechanics and a great campaign mode. If you've played games such as Empire At War or are a W40k fan then you have no excuse to not get this game.","April 22","true","8.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

Do you just really like beating yourself over the head with a Games Workshop hammer every three years, and haven't had a Dawn of War game in so long that you're beginning to get withdrawal symptoms?\n\nDon't worry, Tindalos Interactive has you covered.\n\nFor those of you who may have tried Battlefleet Gothic: Armada during its beta test - don't worry, it's a lot better now. This game is actually surprisingly well polished (barring the occasional egregious typo), and while I can't claim to have played any multiplayer yet, I can promise you, the campaign is tippity-top quality. Golden and bedazzled with two-headed eagles, from start to finish. In fact, I'd argue it's better than the Dawn of War campaigns ever were - it completely negates the old irritation that DoW campaigns fell prey to - that of allowing the story's interesting material to congeal at the beginning and end. This is one well-paced story mode.\n\nThe only real criticism I can make, beside the occasional crash at the start of a battle, is that the game's friendly advice and some of its tooltips (particularly where regards convoy missions) are utter tosh. Don't split up your transports - keep them together. I've never lost a ship that way. Not much of a criticism, huh? I guess the game could use more fleets and factions to play with - but then, Tindalos has that in the works. Check back in six months.\n\nI'm writing this review in the full and complete knowledge that you have probably already long since made up your mind about whether this is the kind of game you'd enjoy. If you like playing ship-versus-ship line battles (in space) (with snowploughs) this is the game for you. If you don't, go read another positive review.

In fact, I'd argue it's better than the Dawn of War campaigns ever were - it completely negates the old irritation that DoW campaigns fell prey to - that of allowing the story's interesting material to congeal at the beginning and end. This is one well-paced story mode.\n\nThe only real criticism I can make, beside the occasional crash at the start of a battle, is that the game's friendly advice and some of its tooltips (particularly where regards convoy missions) are utter tosh. Don't split up your transports - keep them together. I've never lost a ship that way. Not much of a criticism, huh? I guess the game could use more fleets and factions to play with - but then, Tindalos has that in the works. Check back in six months.\n\nI'm writing this review in the full and complete knowledge that you have probably already long since made up your mind about whether this is the kind of game you'd enjoy. If you like playing ship-versus-ship line battles (in space) (with snowploughs) this is the game for you. If you don't, go read another positive review. There's no shortage.","May 4","true","31.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This game is literially a rip right from the table top version of battlefleet gothic but this is a real time strategy game. No dice. Not a turn based game.\n\nIt is a fantastic game which was a surprise to me as it is better than what I thought this game would be. The story is split into 5 chapters and a prologue. The prologue consists of you learning the game along with following the story. Over the course of the 5 chapters, several events in the story line and lore of W40k occurs. Each chapter consists of events that occur during the years that each chapter covers before and during the 12th Black Crusade.\n\nStory/Campaign:\nYou play as Admiral Spire of the Imperial Navy Battlefleet Gothic. It is your job to defend the systems and it's planets of the Gothic Sector from Traitor forces, Chaos forces, Eldar and Ork pirates during the events that take place during the 12th Black Crusade as Abbadon the Despoiler decides to attack the Gothic Sector.\n\nI loved the campaign but there are very repetative missions (at least they are quick. But seriously playing Data Retrieval over and over and over again is repetative). The cutscenes are amazing! The music, voice acting and sound is amazing. The choices and mission results in some cases have an impact to the game!\n\nThis game consists on a space battles on a 2-D space using several ship types - escorts, light cruisers, cruisers, battlecruisers and battleships. You as an admiral of one of four factions get to select these ships and upgrade them.\n\nMore Information:\n\nMicro Management Hell People are Talking About:\n\nThis so called "micromanagement hell" people complain about seriously makes me question if they have ever played the original Dawn of War series or Star Craft 1. Micro management in this game isn't entirely perfect, more on that later when I've finished this game's campaign, but it works! You are only controlling at best 12 ships maximum and can work with them.  This game is a really good strategy game that literially rips the board game the difference really is at least on the table top version you can think about what to do each turn. This game "solves" this the special feature that makes all of the statics and strategy in this game possible... It's called Press the Space Bar to slow down time... A lot of these people complaining about the "micro management hell" really don't seem to understand this concept. In all honesty, this game has much less micro management than Star Craft 2 and I prefer this for casual play and enjoyment.\n\n2-D Space:\n\nUmm... for people complaining.. It's a rip from the table top... Stop complaining. If you don't like it don't play it. Simple as that. This game is designed to be like this not because the game developers can't comprehend 3-D space or space comabt in games, yes someone complained about this -.-, but because it was from the board game that uses a 2-D space grid.","April 24","true","27.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","3"

That said there is a lot of micro managing needed for each cruiser size ship, i'd say you can get away with grouping light cruisers and definatly group escorts, but the larger cruisers and battleships need to be managed individually whilst also working together. To help with this there is the "Tactical Cogitator" ability, which slows down the game time significantly, makes all the micro managing much easier to handle and gives you a chance for quick changes in course or activating several abilities at once.\n\nSo far I'm enjoying the campaign, its a nice touch that there are multiple outcomes based on your success or failure in story missions and the side missions. It takes a little while to get to a point where you have complete free reign over what areas you can opporate in as a new sub-sector activates for each of the first few turns. There is also a limit to how many times you can deploy per turn, so don't feel bad if you seem to be loosing worlds, its going to happen, but you can claw them back from time to time, I think its less of a difficulty mechanic and more to do with the overall story.\n\nDownsides, the Eldar. They're just so damm fast and the Pulsar is very powerful, fourtunatly the Developers listened to the feed back and have re-balanced them. Micro manegment can get a little bit overwhelming in the larger battles, but i suppose the leveling up system is mean to help introduce you in stages so you can get better as you have to take on more.\n\nOverall I fully recomend this game and hope to see it continue in the future.","April 24","true","33.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It wasn't a base building, 'send out ships and have them fight' RTS that I'm used to. Instead, it has customization of ships before battle with a variety of different game modes that are randomly chosen in the solo skirmish mode with epic battles between ships of colossal sizes. I am thoroughly enjoying what I paid for, surpassing all expectations I had for the game. I've clocked in 20 hours on the beta alone.\n\nThe gameplay is fantastic, with each race having it's own strengths and weaknesses. Each race presented so far is beautifully represented with their ships. The abilities constantly mix up the combat. You rank up and gain access to more ships as you progress. The campaign, from what little they've shown, is undoubtedly going to be fun.\n\nThis is truly a gem of a Warhammer 40k game. This is the first videogame I've encountered or even heard of that does Warhammer 40k space combat, and it is a beautiful representation of it. The first step into this realm is a glorious one and one that I have been waiting for for a long time. Thank you developers for all the work you've put into this. I have a feeling I will enjoy this game almost as much as I enjoyed Dawn of War.\n\nJust make sure those modders have some tools to play with in the future. It's never a bad idea.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamesear/recommended/363680/","gamesear","Gamesear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamesear/","31 products in account","First of all, allow me to say that I am a massive Warhammer 40k fan, so the things you'll read below will come with a certain bias, though I will try and thread the middle of the line.\n\nSo what is Battlefleet Gothic: Armada? Its a Warhammer 40k themed RTS that pits four distinct factions against one another, each one with ridiculously large weaponry mounted atop of even larger ships, as well as abilities and playstyles that represent the original lore surprisingly well. In the case of Orks this means yelling, shooting, and literally stuffing crewmen into torpedoes in order to get them to the action as quickly as possible, sanity or safety be damned!\n\nBut even if you ignore all of the Warhammer 40k elements I would still say that Battlfleet Gothic is one of the most interesting RTS games I've played in recent years, though its not without its faults, most notably the rather shaky multiplayer balance.\n\nBut first, allow me to briefly go over a couple of elements that make Battlefleet Gothic an enjoyable experience for me:\n\n* The main reason I find the battles so compelling is the customization system which allows you to specialize your ships in a variety of ways, all of which play similarly enough to not be confusing, but also distinctly enough to offer a unique way of handling any situation. For example, if you ever get bored of playing with the standard Imperial loadout that focuses on heavy frontal armor and powerful broadside attacks, you can invest some resources into swapping around weaponry to create a fleet of fast-moving carrier ships that prefer to attack indirectly through the use of bombers and boarding parties.\n\n* The second reason is quite simple, the battles are a bundle of quick, chaotic fun. Since most of them last 10 minutes or less its hard to get angry if you're losing, and any victory you secure won't get dragged out for so long that it stops being exciting. All of this combined means that for me personally Battlefleet Gothic has that magical ability to vacuum free time, the same way games such as Civilization IV capture their victims. The temptation to start up another match right after winning the previous one is deceptively attractive, and most of the time results in me having a completely messed up sleep schedule.\n\nAnd speaking of messed up, here are the two main issues I have with Battlefleet Gothic:\n\n* If you're not a fan of Warhammer 40k, or if you simply don't care about the lore, you're most likely going to be extremely disappointed with the campaign's story as its comically cheesy, melodramatic, and often downright ridiculous. I had a good bit of fun with it, mostly because the voice acting and overall themes are spot on, but its well worth mentioning that those of you that aren't Warhammer 40k fans might have a less than stellar experience. The campaign gameplay, however, I have very little complaints about, so if you don't give a rat's tail about the story, you'll be perfectly fine.\n\n* The bigger issue is the problem of balance. There doesn't seem to be any matchmaking available to separate new and experienced players, which as you might imagine results in a complete and utter stomp. The secondary problem is that some matchups are inherently imbalanced, especially the early game Eldar vs Orks one. The issue stems from the fact that Orks are slow and inaccurate while the Eldar are nimble and mostly long ranged, so almost every single match ends up the same way - the Eldar run away, and the Orks pointlessly chase after them until they inevitably get whittled down. There are ways to counteract this, but in the early game where Orks only have one type of ship available they are completely out of luck.\n\nClosing Thoughts\nBattlefleet Gothic: Armada is a great RTS, but more importantly, it is a great Warhammer 40k game. It has managed to not just capture the look and feel of the universe, but also use its key elements and lore to further enhance the gameplay, and make the whole thing an immensely enjoyable experience.\n\nIt is currently in need of some balance-fixing in order to reach its true potential, but outside of that I have very little issue with saying that Battlefleet Gothic is well worth your time, especially if you're a Warhammer 40k fan. If not, I would suggest doing a bit more reaserch, or simply waiting on a sale as I can't really guarantee that the campaign will be up to snuff if you aren't a lover of Warhammer 40k branded cheesiness.\n\nFinally, if you're interested in a more detailed review that includes actual gameplay I welcome you to either check out the written review[www.gamesear.com], or the video version I've done:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gz6s2u2m1Q\n\nThank you for reading","April 26","true","17.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The campaign ,if repetitve by the end  is well though and engaging .Its a bit hard cause of  lack of manual and ifo. The tutorial will teach you how to move your ship but the important stuff you will have to figure it by trial and error. I spent quite a few dozens of hours on it\nSo its some great fun, why am i giving a tumb down ?\n\nThats simple, the game was clearly rushed out , the multiplayer part is really poorly thought and even primitive. Primitive as you cant  have a team channel for 2v2 , most often the number of ships fielded is 4-5 by side, very few points allowed to build your deck, you wont be tired due to heavy micro.\n\nUnbalanced,to say the least. Theres different missions possible , similar to the campaign:\nCruiser clash, all good kill the other ships simple enough ,if you dont face eldars.\nData collection, steal some data from the opponent, the one with the fastest ship will win, remember its randomized so your slow ♥♥♥ ork ships might enounter eldar, then theres absolutely no way for you to win.\nAssassination , same problem your opponent can just run away and quickly warp if he has the fastest ships\nPlanetary defense, it was already a poorly thought mission in the campaign its even worse in multi. You have to reach some part of the map , a circle appaearing randomly on the map . Again you better be really fast and lucky , as it highly favor the defender who as same amount of ships +4 defense platform to help.\nBlockade same problem, you need to take down 4 defenses platform and reach the end of the map, but wait your opponent has still the same amount of ships than you ,good luck..\nTransports,, pray to not be the one to have to guide those fragile butterflies through the map.\n\nThe matchmaking ? Wich matchmaking ?Your level 1 ship can face level 10 ships fully upgraded with favors . So you lose badly and your ships are unusable for one or two turn punishing you even more while the other guy will rake in favors.\n\nThat is when the game works, theres countless bugs, crash to desktop, camera view bugging , ship commands blocked, network problems...It really happens often now.\n\nIt could have been much better , it sounds like it was not tested at all , or by random hobos they took in the street to not pay QA costs.","April 26","false","41.7"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","14","27","0","0"

It is a good game. Graphics are amazing and the UI is simple to use. The AI is brutal (typical for the WH40K series) and always outclasses you.\n\nHowever, I do have some..misgivings.\n\nYour own ship "AI" is about as intelligent as a rock. You MUST micromanage everything, even if you put the abilities to "auto-use". You also have to wrangle and drive your escorts or else they just become something else for your capital ships to knock out of the way causing massive damage to both ships. The AI of your ships should be smart enough to detect the velocities of your other ships and that of your allied ships and move out of the way and use skills and orders apporpriate for what it is doing at the time.\n\nThe multiplayer is inherently flawed in its implementation. Dont like playing against players? Oh well. Want to play with your buddy? Well the invite system MIGHT work. Its like they built the MP aspect of the game for Professional Bracket-based play, which is fine if the game wasnt based off a defunct table-top and catered to a niche market. Also it only supports up to 4 players at one time.\n\nSingle player, while interesting, is also flawed. There are three game modes for SP, Campaign (which is beautiful and lore friendly), Skirmish, and Custom mode.\n\nI havent really played the Campaign past the Beta "tutorial". So I can't comment much on it. Skirmish is where you take random game modes and fight whomever the game wants you to, which defeats the purpose of the Skirmish mode IMHO. The custom mode lets you design any battle you want even picking a random admiral with or with out skills.\n\nThese last two modes pretty much come close to breaking the game for me. I believe the game would have better if FOCUS Entertainment had implemented both the SP and MP the same way they did their War Game series. In which you can create a lobby, invite your friends, await other players to play against, or do a comp stomp.\n\nI understand why they did the things they did because of their leveling systems, dont want people to comp stomp till they get a Battleship then go into combat against other people. However, they have defeated this by having an Admiral needed for each mode.\n\nAll this being said, the game is beautiful and the designers spared no details to the ships and have each faction some plus and bonuses.\n\nOverall, imma be busy for the next few months.","April 23","true","5.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

With a big disclaimer: the game is fun. the customization is fun, the spaceships look cool and if you like Warhammer 40k, you can't go wrong. The reason for the disclaimer is that the RNG makes it suck sometimes. You might have a great fleet and you might get shafted. I felt like I lost sometimes because I just didn't "roll" a good game. Suddenly, something went wrong and I lost. I say this because I don't think I played better or worse too dramatically. I don't flucuate that much in terms of skill. I am a mediocre gamer. Sometimes the RNG gave me easy battles and sometimes I just restarted my admiral because I ended up behind too much. So I just wasted time. Lots of time. I played for an hour or two and reset because my fleet started sucking. Then it happened again. Or it didn't and I still have a save for it. There wasn't any reason it seemed though skill-wise,, just bad or good rolls. I didn't think I did good to win and I didn't feel like I made a mistake when I lost entirely.

Well lets divide up your area of interest.\n\n40K Fan?\nWell in the very first mission you have a Navigator helping your ship to navigate in real space, make sense? Only if you are grossly unfamiliar with 40K. Navigators are hybrid mutants that assist ships in transit through the warp, they couldn't care less about what happens in realspace, except of course the politicing of the Navis Nobilite. Oh, and the Navigator has no third eye, just a glowy patch on their head (with no cloth blocking it! Don't look too closely or you'll die), and they look like a freak, when every lore instance of a navigator describes them as aritocratic humans. I could list more examples, but no-one wants to read a story. Did the devs even do any research on 40K lore?\n\nGameplay?\nUnbalanced as hell. It's not just that each faction has different archetypes and all are ultimately unbalanced, but mission types are unbalanced as well. Are you the Attacker on a Breakthrough mission? You are at a disadvantage. Are you the attacker in a Cruiser Clash (basic kill all enemies) using Eldar while your oppenents are Orks? Hope they don't hide in a gas cloud! If they do you pretty much auto-lose! Are you the Ork attacker fighting Eldar in a cruiser clash? Good luck doing any damage, their engines will see them out of your range pretty much permanently.\nIn addition the game tends to be more about spamming abilities, kiting endlessly, and tons of micromanagement. If this game had been turnbased it would have worked perfectly, but in real time (even with the slow time abilities) it ends up being a click fest.\n\nAdvancement / RPG elements?\nYou start with 3 light cruiser slots, with 2 different types of Light Cruiser. Both are almost identical, the Imperial for instance has all the same armor and weapons, except one has torpedoes and the other has a forward facing Lance. The Chaos have one with broadside lances, and one with launch bays (fighters, bombers). They are almost identical, and it takes 3ish missions to get a Cruiser slot. I've done 15ish missions and haven't unlocked any bigger ships yet, so the Gods of the Warp alone know how long it will take to get Battleships. It is a huge grind, and you are punished for losing. If a ship is destroyed in battle you can't use it for the next two battles. Sounds fun right? You lose one mission and then are at a huge disadvantage for the next 2 missions, making it more likely to lose those missions, in turn punishing you further. So what ends up happening? People will go into missions with ships they don't care about, and immediately warp out, just to ignore this 'feature'. It ends up being super fun!\n\n\nAll-in-all:\nThe game is fun, but not $40 worth of fun. I'd suggest waiting until the Steam Summer Sale, get it for 50% off, with the benefit of a few balance patches evening things out.\n\nEdit: After playing for a few more hours the game does get more fun. However, it is really only when you get access to Battlecruisers (the second to last ship tier, which takes many, many hours to achieve) does the game really expand. Additionally if you unlock Battlecruisers with one race that does nothing at all for your other races, you need to sink even more hours in to unlock it with the other races. Even with battlecruisers the races are still very limited, Chaos BCs don't get above 50 armor for any facing, Eldar never get shields, Orks are slow tanks with no range regardless of the ship class, Imperial ships are always jacks-of-all-trades. In addition the further in you get the more annoying the destroyed ship, lost in the warp, and heavily damaged modifers become. With a 700 point game you are often using more than 50% of your capital ships, if it goes very poorly and you cannot warp out injured ships you may have very few capital ships for your next 2 battles.\nEven after more time my recommendation doesn't change, wait for it to go on sale, and wait for some patches.","April 23","false","10.7"," 20 of 40 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","20","40","0","0"

The game needs balancing. Plain and simple, it needs balancing. In the single player campaign it's not as glaring, but in multiplayer it is. The fleets are not evenly matched. The game does have bugs, but it's a brand new title. That will happen. Finally some of the missions that you run are horribly unfair and stilted in favor of one side or the other. The destroy the defense platforms is nearly impossible from the defender's side. And easy as pie from the attacker. The transport mission can be a royal pain. You don't get a chance to recover, on either side. If the enemy gets lucky and wanders onto your transports, you lose. But if you're attacking and you wander onto the enemy transports? You win. But it's nearly impossible to catch them if they get past you. The data recovery mission is a shambling mess of see who can board who's ships the most. It's a mess.\n\nNow, the good parts. The game is fun. It is a very well done tactical space combat game. It's set on a 2D plane, which makes sense given the intricacies involved in trying to run a fleet in a 3D environment. The controls are solid, the ships respond well, and the progression through the ships feels like an achievement. You can feel and see the difference in raw power between a light cruiser and a regular cruiser, and between a regular cruiser and a battle cruiser. Down the road the light cruisers replace your escorts as expendable ships because you've got big nasty beasts to slug it out with your foe now. The environments are well done, with mines, asteroids and nebula all littering the fields and complicating the battles, giving them more depth. This is a game that requires some thought and some planning. You need to keep in mind the strengths and weaknesses of your other ships as you build your fleet.\n\nAll in all, for me this game is very much worth the price at launch. But if you're still unsure? Just wait till the summer sale and snag it for 20 to 30 percent off or whatever sale they put it on to sell more copies.","April 21","true","33.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

From the fastest frigates to the gigantic, miles-long battleships, the player will customize all aspects of his ships: weaponry, defense and support sub-systems, but also crew, captains, and more... each customization affecting the very performances of the ship and the special abilities available during battle. From battle to battle, the admirals and crew of surviving ships will gain experience and promotions, improving the battle-readiness of the ships for future, bigger and more dangerous battles.\n\nAdditionally an extensive multiplayer mode with persistent fleets where up to 4 players can battle simultaneously, Battlefleet Gothic: Armada also features a big story campaign, taking place during the 12th Black Crusade and putting players in the middle of the Gothic War that raged between the Imperium and Abaddon the Despoiler. Players will be at the centre of every fight, commanding fleets of gigantic ships as the Chaos unleash a sequential chain of surprise attacks on Imperium worlds – the start of 20 years of warring in the sector.","April 21","true","35.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Now, at long last, we finally get to see them come to life in a game that does them justice. So this is a space based, ship to ship battle RTS game. I Played this game during beta and even then I was impressed. So let's go over the pros and cons of this game, because this is one alot of people have been watching closely.\n\nPros-\nShip design- The models of the ships are 100% faithful to the franchise, and they all look gorgeous.\nFactions- Each faction, though they all share certain common features such as upgrades, feel unique in the way they play. Imperials are about up close, powerful broadside barrages. Chaos are fast long range raiders. Orks are tanky, close range brawlers that love to ram other ships. The Eldar are fast and use hit and run tactics. Each playstyle makes perfect sense in the context to their race. And given that this is 40k, you can bet other factions are on the way. Space marines are already confirmed, along with a mystery faction following that.\nVoice acting- Although it's pretty apparent this wasn't a big budget title and they did have a huge variety of voices in the game, the ones they DO have are spot on and feel perfect for the 40k universe.\n- Very strategic and challenging- I was actually surprised at this. The AI will actually kick your ♥♥♥ if your not careful. You actually have to manage and position your ships to prevail. Also remember what I mentioned about ramming? This game has full collision physics, that means you can actually crash your ships into each other if your not careful.\n\nCons-\nMission Variety- It feels like the mission types really aren't as diverse as they should be. I feel there are several mission types that reward bum rush tactics too much. I also rarely find there's an actual advantage to deploying your ships in different ways.\n2d- Although the game is very much visually in 3d, the gameplay is 2d. In many ways this isn't actually that big a deal, as properly doing 3d gameplay in a space rts can be very difficult to do.\nSoundtrack- Although the music they DO have is very good and appropriate, there's zero diversity. There's no special theme's for Chaos, orks, or the Eldar, which I think is a bit of a shame.\nBugs- Although the game is in pretty good shape for on launch, I have encountered a couple bugs ingame that WERE present during the beta.\n\nBottom line is, if you're a 40k fan, absolutely get this game. It more than does the source material justice, and it despite it not being perfect, it more than delivers, especially for only $40. Plus, buying within 2 months of release will get you the next 2 dlc factions for free, so not only did the devs make a good game, they want to reward you for buying it with free stuff.

You might not use it in the begining when you only field 2 or 3 ships with few to no abilities, however in the end you are likely to use it in every battle.\n\nAnother great thing is the ability to customise you ships allowing you a variety of different options that can fill in niche positions across you fleet.\nYou can combine these options to create long ranged carriers, knife fighting / ramming monsters or a big and bulky tank you can teleport infront of your fleet to create a giant wall of steel .\n\nThings such as the "Favours" system also brings something extra to the game.\nThe fact that you do not spamm out units and instead level the ships is in my honest opinion a great way to "bond" with them.\n\nOne should never be afraid to lose, the consequences can be dire but it is not a true issue.\n\nThe story is great, if you like the WH40K universe.\nThe cinematics/storytelling is spot on, I must admit that I broke out in goosebumps during the last cinematic. It felt truly epic, the music is also quite good.\nThe fact that you are given some choices on how to deal with the Eldar is also nice.\n\nI have not played the multiplayer since it has gone live but the sense I got in the Beta was that it was fun enough aslong as you like the style of the game.\nSome match types are more enjoyable than others.\n\nI had 2 FATAL ERRORS during my playthrough of the campaign, which where annoying but nothing too big.\nI noticed that the FPS fluctuates a tad here and there but nothing major like say XCOM 2.\n\nShould you buy this thing?\nIf you like WH40K, RTS's, Bombastic choirs in the background while you fire missiles away, then yes without a doubt.\n\n9/10\nStill a better shooter then The Division.","April 26","true","43.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The Gameplay is fantastic, variety and customization is nicely done aswell.\n\nSingleplayer\n-A lot of RTS games usually have campaigns, but they're usually boring or just too slopily thrown together to enjoy. This game's campaign is nothing like that. It has great cutscenes, ones that warhammer fans absolutely love with that imperial touch. The game makes you feel like you're really part of the story. On the first playthrough you can't wait for your next turn to see what cutscene and priority mission comes next. Failure in these missions is not like most games. If you lose you don't just restart, you lose those ships and have to wait for a turn if damaged or two if destroyed. If you fail a priority that just means Abbadon will have more at his disposal to use against Humanity. After completion of the first playthrough you may end up playing again trying to pull victorys on missions you had previously suffered defeats.\n\nMultiplayer\n-The Multiplayer is a lot of fun and can keep you entertained for hours. The randomly generated maps make things a lot more interesting because it allows you (And a teammate if you do 2v2) to strategize and prepare for engagements around various gas clouds (which give you camoflauge.) and asteroid fields. (which damage you if the proper upgrade is not installed.) I found that even if I was losing, I could still grin as I would have caused so much destruction that I would feel the victory was well earned by the other player.\n\nAll factions play quite differently and allow for plenty of variety in playstyle.\n-Imperial Navy ships are heavily armored and are generally covered in macro cannons for devastating broadsides yet lack the speed some may wish to have.\n-Chaos ships are quite fast and have weaker armor but still enough to survive some of the broadsides that the imp navy can throw at you. Their extra launchbays and long range assaults make hit and run assaults somewhat viable.\n-Ork ships are massive and are extremely resilent to damage. While Imp navy is tough, they can't say they're Ork tough. Ork ships have massive healthpools and strong armor aswell has having lots of ramming damage. While their accuracy is not the greatest, their weapons hit the hardest in the game aside from Eldar pulsars. An Ork battleship is one of the hardest things to kill in this game.\n-Eldar has quite the weird playstyle and can have a large learning curve. While Orks have their best weapons on their prows, Eldar have ONLY prow weapons meaning you must always face what you want to shoot. Eldar also lack shields and instead have holofields and allow you to dodge and absorb incoming fire as long as you move. Eldar ships are also very fast and can turn extremely fast. This combined with only forward firing weapons mean you only have so much time to fire else you ram what you're shooting at, something that is lethal for the fragile eldar ships. Things like Vauls maneuvre (allows you to instantly do a 180) make this much easier to perform however.\n\nI have to say things were shaky during the Beta but things are quite balanced and tweaked now. All in all, this game is a great experiance and a must get for fans of the Warhammer series. I can only hope there is only more to come with space marines on their way and a mystery fleet already announced. So what are you doing? Buy this game! For the Emperor!","April 26","true","73.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is an excellent game.\n\nEver since I got into Warhammer 40k, Battlefleet Gothic has always been the one aspects of the franchise that really interested me but I felt would never be represented anymore. This computer game is very true to the general feel of Battlefleet Gothic, and one of the best things about it - it's *hard*.\n\nYou can't just zerg-rush people in this game or you're gonna die. Battlefleet Gothic: Armada requires planning, tactics, long-term thinking, and is a real challenge. Kudoes to Tindalos for doing the franchise such justice.\n\nI hope that the armadas of the other races are fleshed out as much as the Imperium, which I suspect they will be, and I'm really looking forward to upcoming expansions, which I will gladly purchase if they are reasonably priced.\n\nI'm normally a strong proponant of saving your cash because entertainment is cheap these days, but buy Battlefleet Gothic: Armada. Tindalos Entertainment deserves to do very well for this, and I am seriously going to be paying attention to their future titles.

You might not use it in the begining when you only field 2 or 3 ships with few to no abilities, however in the end you are likely to use it in every battle.\n\nAnother great thing is the ability to customise you ships allowing you a variety of different options that can fill in niche positions across you fleet.\nYou can combine these options to create long ranged carriers, knife fighting / ramming monsters or a big and bulky tank you can teleport infront of your fleet to create a giant wall of steel .\n\nThings such as the "Favours" system also brings something extra to the game.\nThe fact that you do not spamm out units and instead level the ships is in my honest opinion a great way to "bond" with them.\n\nOne should never be afraid to lose, the consequences can be dire but it is not a true issue.\n\nThe story is great, if you like the WH40K universe.\nThe cinematics/storytelling is spot on, I must admit that I broke out in goosebumps during the last cinematic. It felt truly epic, the music is also quite good.\nThe fact that you are given some choices on how to deal with the Eldar is also nice.\n\nI have not played the multiplayer since it has gone live but the sense I got in the Beta was that it was fun enough aslong as you like the style of the game.\nSome match types are more enjoyable than others.\n\nI had 2 FATAL ERRORS during my playthrough of the campaign, which where annoying but nothing too big.\nI noticed that the FPS fluctuates a tad here and there but nothing major like say XCOM 2.\n\nShould you buy this thing?\nIf you like WH40K, RTS's, Bombastic choirs in the background while you fire missiles away, then yes without a doubt.\n\n9/10\nStill a better shooter then The Division.","April 26","true","43.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The Gameplay is fantastic, variety and customization is nicely done aswell.\n\nSingleplayer\n-A lot of RTS games usually have campaigns, but they're usually boring or just too slopily thrown together to enjoy. This game's campaign is nothing like that. It has great cutscenes, ones that warhammer fans absolutely love with that imperial touch. The game makes you feel like you're really part of the story. On the first playthrough you can't wait for your next turn to see what cutscene and priority mission comes next. Failure in these missions is not like most games. If you lose you don't just restart, you lose those ships and have to wait for a turn if damaged or two if destroyed. If you fail a priority that just means Abbadon will have more at his disposal to use against Humanity. After completion of the first playthrough you may end up playing again trying to pull victorys on missions you had previously suffered defeats.\n\nMultiplayer\n-The Multiplayer is a lot of fun and can keep you entertained for hours. The randomly generated maps make things a lot more interesting because it allows you (And a teammate if you do 2v2) to strategize and prepare for engagements around various gas clouds (which give you camoflauge.) and asteroid fields. (which damage you if the proper upgrade is not installed.) I found that even if I was losing, I could still grin as I would have caused so much destruction that I would feel the victory was well earned by the other player.\n\nAll factions play quite differently and allow for plenty of variety in playstyle.\n-Imperial Navy ships are heavily armored and are generally covered in macro cannons for devastating broadsides yet lack the speed some may wish to have.\n-Chaos ships are quite fast and have weaker armor but still enough to survive some of the broadsides that the imp navy can throw at you. Their extra launchbays and long range assaults make hit and run assaults somewhat viable.\n-Ork ships are massive and are extremely resilent to damage. While Imp navy is tough, they can't say they're Ork tough. Ork ships have massive healthpools and strong armor aswell has having lots of ramming damage. While their accuracy is not the greatest, their weapons hit the hardest in the game aside from Eldar pulsars. An Ork battleship is one of the hardest things to kill in this game.\n-Eldar has quite the weird playstyle and can have a large learning curve. While Orks have their best weapons on their prows, Eldar have ONLY prow weapons meaning you must always face what you want to shoot. Eldar also lack shields and instead have holofields and allow you to dodge and absorb incoming fire as long as you move. Eldar ships are also very fast and can turn extremely fast. This combined with only forward firing weapons mean you only have so much time to fire else you ram what you're shooting at, something that is lethal for the fragile eldar ships. Things like Vauls maneuvre (allows you to instantly do a 180) make this much easier to perform however.\n\nI have to say things were shaky during the Beta but things are quite balanced and tweaked now. All in all, this game is a great experiance and a must get for fans of the Warhammer series. I can only hope there is only more to come with space marines on their way and a mystery fleet already announced. So what are you doing? Buy this game!

One of the stumbling blocks for me getting started was expecting the game to play at roughly the same difficulty as most RTS I've played through in the past, but in Battlefleet Gothic you really can't just mass your ships and just point them at the enemy and hope to win most of the time. Positioning and knowing how your ships perform compared to the enemy are really important to the point where you might breeze through the first few missions only to find yourself losing mission after mission until you adjust your fleet comp and tactics based on your foe and the objectives.\n\nSo, I guess if you're looking for a C&C type RTS this probably isn't it, but if you're looking for something more micro intensive with a bit of a learning curve this might be the game for you, That said, if you're into multiplayer I can't make any recommendation on that yet as I haven't delved into that part of the game at all.","April 21","true","11.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

They drift. They can't turn on a dime, and they sure as hell feel that way,\nHowever, after mastering your ship's movement abilities and weapons is only the beginning.\nExpect a lot of losses before you get the hang of it.\n\n-Graphics-\nSimply stunning. See the bulkheads of an enemy ship bend and crack with each round.\nWatch your ship "rock" as it unleashes a barrage of heavy cannon fire.\nWatch the enemy ships INDIVIDUAL decks collapse as their ship implodes.\n\nThey definitely spent a lot of time making this game absolutely gorgeous.\nSo if you ever get a lull in combat, or simply want to watch an enemy ship crack in half, zoom that camera in. Its a beautiful sight.\n\n-Sound-\nAmazing soundtrack to go along with the echoing burts of cannon fire and the roar of engines. When an enemy cruiser (or heavier) explodes... the sound will make you ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nSOLID 9.5/10 in my book.\nThe only thing that could make this game better is a TAU FLEET!","April 21","true","22.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wafflesfordays/recommended/363680/","wafflesfordays","Unlawful Waffle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wafflesfordays/","91 products in account","Let me start off by saying I am addicted to this game. But I still would not recommend it now. I may in the future, however.\n\nPros:\n-Stays true to the 40k universe. Both in the story and atmosphere of the game, and the gameplay. Imperials are sturdy, resolute, and have the ability to crush their enemies like the hammer of the emperor. Chaos are like a twister dagger, fast and deadly, but can't take the punishment of the imperials. Eldar are swift and lethal, but their ships are made of wet tissue. And orks are wild and deadly. They are insanely strong, but also insanely hard to control, more like holding a pack of hungry pitbulls on a leash than controlling an amry. Any 40k player should be happy with this.\n-Strong story that stays true to the original tabletop campaign.\n-The campaign is long and unforgiving, exactly as a void war should be.\n-Good mix of gametypes in the multiplayer\n-Decent community\n-Challenging and rewarding gameplay\n-THE BIG RED BUTTON\n-The orks. Seriously too damn fun. You can get a giant snotling teleporter for a weapon. Freebootaz are the best damn thing in the void of 40k.\n\nAnd here is why I would not recommend this game, for now at least\nCons:\n-Gamebreaking bugs. The game was in beta for a month and has been out for a month now. Two months to fix the game. It has gotten better. But between 25-50% of my multiplayer games end with a fatal error crashing the game. Somewhere around 10-20% of campaign missions end with the game crashing. This is seriously ruining the game. There should not be this many errors.\n-Balance. I wouldn't expect a game to have good balance shortly after release, but its still a serious issue. Any game besides cruiser clash against eldar involves the eldar skating around the map and the other player driving in circles. The nova cannon was OP, killing escorts in one shot, but they nerfed it into the ground. Its is innacurate and is so weak it can only take the shields off an escort. Orks lost their best upgrade, the engine boost, giving them no way to compete in speed. Balance is not horrible, but its not good or even okay\n-There are no different maps. There are different backgrounds and different amounts of space debris, but overall there is very little beside generic space. This is 40k. You can do so much in space. Live a little devs\n-No way to choose gametype in multplayer. If you don't like escort games, suck it up buttercup. You still gotta play them.\n-You can only play with one friend\n-In 2v2s, games are either 600 or 700 points. This is annoying because you're always stuck with light ships. I know the game can run more ships on the map, they do so in the campaign. I don't know why they felt the need to limit this.\n-Finally the minor bugs, that aren't gamebreaking. Stuff like not being able to issue special orders or use abilities in multiplayer.\n\nIts a fun game but in its current state, it is not good. If the updates fix it to the point I no longer I have to worry about constant crashes, I'll change this review.\n\nEDIT:\nThis game has an awful community of fun-hating, spite filled cry babies. The worst is a large percentage of eldar and chaos players. When they've lost the battle but they still have ships, they decide to run. Not warp away and end the game. No, they decide to run away for 20 minutes, knowing that they cannot win. They know they have no hope of winning but they know that you can't catch them and they are intent on wasting your time.\n\nIf you think about, this horrible community just puts it closer to the real tabletop one. Just like the 40k tabletop scene, this game is filled with spiteful meta drones. I'm done with this game. Not the devs fault this time.","May 10","false","57.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Well lets divide up your area of interest.\n\n40K Fan?\nWell in the very first mission you have a Navigator helping your ship to navigate in real space, make sense? Only if you are grossly unfamiliar with 40K. Navigators are hybrid mutants that assist ships in transit through the warp, they couldn't care less about what happens in realspace, except of course the politicing of the Navis Nobilite. Oh, and the Navigator has no third eye, just a glowy patch on their head (with no cloth blocking it! Don't look too closely or you'll die), and they look like a freak, when every lore instance of a navigator describes them as aritocratic humans. I could list more examples, but no-one wants to read a story. Did the devs even do any research on 40K lore?\n\nGameplay?\nUnbalanced as hell. It's not just that each faction has different archetypes and all are ultimately unbalanced, but mission types are unbalanced as well. Are you the Attacker on a Breakthrough mission? You are at a disadvantage. Are you the attacker in a Cruiser Clash (basic kill all enemies) using Eldar while your oppenents are Orks? Hope they don't hide in a gas cloud! If they do you pretty much auto-lose! Are you the Ork attacker fighting Eldar in a cruiser clash? Good luck doing any damage, their engines will see them out of your range pretty much permanently.\nIn addition the game tends to be more about spamming abilities, kiting endlessly, and tons of micromanagement. If this game had been turnbased it would have worked perfectly, but in real time (even with the slow time abilities) it ends up being a click fest.\n\nAdvancement / RPG elements?\nYou start with 3 light cruiser slots, with 2 different types of Light Cruiser. Both are almost identical, the Imperial for instance has all the same armor and weapons, except one has torpedoes and the other has a forward facing Lance. The Chaos have one with broadside lances, and one with launch bays (fighters, bombers). They are almost identical, and it takes 3ish missions to get a Cruiser slot. I've done 15ish missions and haven't unlocked any bigger ships yet, so the Gods of the Warp alone know how long it will take to get Battleships. It is a huge grind, and you are punished for losing. If a ship is destroyed in battle you can't use it for the next two battles. Sounds fun right? You lose one mission and then are at a huge disadvantage for the next 2 missions, making it more likely to lose those missions, in turn punishing you further. So what ends up happening? People will go into missions with ships they don't care about, and immediately warp out, just to ignore this 'feature'. It ends up being super fun!\n\n\nAll-in-all:\nThe game is fun, but not $40 worth of fun. I'd suggest waiting until the Steam Summer Sale, get it for 50% off, with the benefit of a few balance patches evening things out.\n\nEdit: After playing for a few more hours the game does get more fun. However, it is really only when you get access to Battlecruisers (the second to last ship tier, which takes many, many hours to achieve) does the game really expand. Additionally if you unlock Battlecruisers with one race that does nothing at all for your other races, you need to sink even more hours in to unlock it with the other races. Even with battlecruisers the races are still very limited, Chaos BCs don't get above 50 armor for any facing, Eldar never get shields, Orks are slow tanks with no range regardless of the ship class, Imperial ships are always jacks-of-all-trades. In addition the further in you get the more annoying the destroyed ship, lost in the warp, and heavily damaged modifers become. With a 700 point game you are often using more than 50% of your capital ships, if it goes very poorly and you cannot warp out injured ships you may have very few capital ships for your next 2 battles.\nEven after more time my recommendation doesn't change, wait for it to go on sale, and wait for some patches.","April 23","false","10.7"," 20 of 40 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","20","40","0","0"

I enjoy it for several reasons. Its one of the few games I can access in short spurts and get some satisfactory gaming time in. My schedule does not allow me to sit down for more than 15-20 minutes to play. This game allows that. I sit down and can play a mission or two and get that fix. Or I can play for hours because its fun.\n\nThere are more than a few modes to play in. You have a single player campaign which has you playing the Imperial faction. You have multiplayer where you play against other people in 1v1 and now 2v2 player battles where you can choose to play one of 4 different factions. Eldar, Imperials, Chaos, and Orcs are the current factions available. Each faction plays in a unique style as each faction has different strengths and weaknesses. And then you have a solo play where you pick a faction and create an Admiral. Then you random solo mission as your admiral and fleet levels up.\n\nEach mission you do, be it solo or multi play, gains you experience. Your admiral and your ships all gain experience. You then use this experience to buy different skills and abilities to customize your fleet. As your Admiral levels up, you open up more ship options as larger ships become available along with more smaller ships.\n\nThe battles themselves play much like an x/y single plane flat surface where your ships manuever. There is only left right forward and back. There is no up and down. You do not have a true space experience in being able to move in all directions. I believe this is due to it being inspired by a board game. Its still fun. Your ships are fitted with different weapons which have firing arcs. This means in order to fire off say your macro cannons which only fire broadside in a 90 degree arc, you have to move your ship so its left and right faces your target. You have weapons which fire from either the front or the sides in different degrees of firing which add to your depth of strategy and make it so you don;t just bring your ships in range and see what happens.\n\nThe graphics are ok. They don't appear to be cutting edge but they aren't too old either. The sound is ok as well. There isn't a large variety in the little voice acting bits but they are there. They can get a bit tedious to hear every time your make a movement with a ship as there aren't a great variety.\n\nBottom line is its a finished game that works as intended and delivers on its promises. It also appears to have a strong multiplayer community and the developers have already promised more factions in the future to add to the depth of play. Its worth the purchase price.","May 3","true","119.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game has a lot of depth and requires study of the ship tactics and abilities.  However, it's best to learn as you go and play in AI skirmish to prepare for the Campaign, or go multiplayer if you are up for a serious challenge against skilled players.\n\nI am going through the Single Player campaign on Normal and finding it immersive and challenging.  The characters in the storyline really take their 40K roles seriously.  I have heard there are some AI issues in some missions but that's to be expected (just reload if the AI goofs on you).\n\nI'm not a fast-twitch RTS player but I like the combat.  The game offers an immediate slow-down mode via the spacebar (called Tactical Cogitators) if the gameplay gets to frantic.  You can use it all you want in AI skirmish, but it's frowned upon to abuse it in multiplayer.   The combat is on a 2D plane but even then the battle action can get complex (you can view the combat in 3D, of course).\n\nI've found myself engrossed in studying the game's tactics the past four weeks.  The last time I was engrossed in game this much was with the Earth Defense Force series (that's more of a 3rd person shooter/arcade game).\n\nI like the Warhammer 40K Fluff and this game has a ton of it for the Imperium, Eldar, Orks and Chaos.  Also the developers are going to add the Space Marines faction and the Tao as DLC.\n\nThere are some technical issues with this game just to get it to run.  I have two Win 8.1 machines and it ran fine on my primary computer but had issues on the tablet (Surface Pro 3).  But I eventually got the version working on the tablet after going over the Technical FAQ posted in the game's Steam Forums by the developers.\n\nThe only thing missing for me is a way to go back and rewatch my battles using a free-roam camera.  So far you can't see any of the battles up close unless you go Tactical Cogitators and zoom in on the action.  I hope the developers add a battle recorder soon.\n\nAnyhow, if you are a WH40K fan then I highly recommend the purchase, and if you have never heard of 40K this is a great way to experience it the first time.  Just be prepared to use the trouble-shooting FAQS on the forums if you are the small percentage that run into technical issues.\n\nFor reference I'm running Window 8.1 Enterprise on my primary system with an i7 cpu, 16GB ram, and a GTX 980 ti GPU, and the game runs great and with no issues.\n\nMy secondary system, a Surface Pro 3, has Win 8.1 Professional and an i5 processor, and an intel GPU.  That system had problems running the game, not due to hardware, but improper install procedures and missing some DirectX files.  Going thru the Technical FAQ resolved my issues and I was able to play BFGA on a plane trip (though it ate up a lot of battery power).","May 18","true","36.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Simply put, this game is wonderful.\n\nTindalos, the developers of Battlefleet Gothic: Armada love the Warhammer 40000 universe and it shows in their game. BFG:A captures the Warhammer 40k universe to a surprising degree. The gameplay, the writing, the art, voice overs, general sound design, the interface--all of it feels right at home with the 40k universe.\n\nThe gameplay is incredibly fun. Each faction (Imperial Navy, Chaos, Orks, Eldar with Space Marines and Tau forthcoming) has distinct gameplay strategies, skills, and upgrades that set them apart and make them feel distinct. In addition you can customize each of your ships to a large degree--name, skills, upgrades, subfaction favours, and soon even it's appearance. It manages to capture the feeling of having your own Tabletop fleet and brings it to the digital realm.\n\nThere are a lot of different mission types to keep the game from feeling stale. There is an enjoyable single player campaign as well as 1v1 and 2v2 multiplayer. The community is simply one of the best I have ever encountered in an online game.\n\nTindalos is continually updating the game to add new features and remove any bugs. Their level of engagement with the community and dedication to improving their game is really nice to see in this age of "Early Access then abandon." I'm really looking forward to the future of this game.\n\nIn short, if you like Warhammer 40000 or sci-fi naval combat then buy this game.

The game has a lot of fun and satisfaction in it, but it has lots of bugs that need to be worked out before I can recommend it.\n\nThe bad:\nThe factions are not balanced appropriately. Currently, Chaos has a tough time even if their fleet build is optimised. To a lesser extent, the same is true for Imperial. I've found Orks to be really strong, but every faction burns when fighting Eldar.\nThe Eldar are built so that they are either an absolute pushover (new players) or maximized - you won't touch them and your ships will be evaporated. It's not fun to play alongside them or against them because of how two dimensional the results are.\n\nThe bugs: Matches failing to load, hard crashes, menu lockups, server login issues, visual bugs, etc. I believe these will be patched but they are here, now.\n\nThe good:\nIt looks super pretty. The ships feel massive and powerful. The factions play differently and have a reasonable amount of options, though more balance is needed. The voice acting is strong and cheesy. Gaining a victory feels like an accomplishment and there are unique satisfactions to be had in these matchups.\n\nThe specific:\nThe game is real time, with a 'slow' function that you can use to micro manage your units. Expect to lose, and to win. Matches are between 5 and 10 minutes long. Players with more experience will have more options and more effective ships than you. No custom matches for multiplayer. 2v2 is current maximum, party size is limit 2 so you cannot set up a match with 4 friends. Mouse and keyboard only, I wouldn't recommend setting up a controller for it. Better with friends.","May 17","true","43.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You can feel your ships weight as they float through the void, the power that is thrown out of their weapons, and the terror that awaits them in the warp.

The game does have its downsides unfortunately, it is filled with a lot of bugs.

I can not say this enough. So let me tell you the only issues with the game.\n\nYou can in fact jump in and start playing and do pretty well without a tutorial. Which is good because there really is no tutorial.\n\nTheres the obligatory tutorial built into the first few min of the game. "Click with this button to go here, click on this and it will do this, click on that and it will do that"\n\nBut the parts of the game that you will really need to do well are not explained. Every gamer at this point knows you either right or left click to move and click and drag to multi select units. HOW the game works is way more important to explain.\n\nThings like what exactly is a boarding action. And how additional boarding actions work. What weapon type something is if its ambigous. Like are torpedoes Macro Weapons or not?\n\nBut the biggest problem is the language involved in the tool tips. Basically instead of saying you have a X% chance of something working under certain situations, it instead says "you have X% chance" of something happening and then you have to know enough about the mechanics of the game to know if that means chance of it happening the way you want it, or doing a quick mathematical formula in your head and knowning that you have to work backwards with the numbers to figure out if its the chance of it failing.\n\nThis is mostly having to do with boarding actions and most specifically dealing with being boarded by or boarding Orcs\n\nI also find that lightning striking which is only supposed to be successful when an enemy's shields are down will work when they are not and sometimes not when they are.\n\n\nSo I give it a 9/10 because it pretty much forces you to go find a wiki to explain how you really should be loading out a ship to fit your individual play style, or use your renown points and then possibly have to pay to respec later when you figure out how things work together.\n\nIn a RPG based game where success or failure dictates the path of a game, it basically sets up a scenario where you either play the game over after completely screwwing your first game up because you loaded out and played wrong. Or you make multuiple saves so that you can try things over and over again and only save the games where you did well.\n\n\nTLDNR....\n\nGood game. Go read wikis because the tool tips are over simplified. And understand that the English language can be used in multiple ways and not always the way you interpret things.\n","May 18","true","15.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

This one isn't, so if you were burned by a past Warhammer title and are reluctant to buy this game for that reason: think again, buy this gem.\nI won't go too much in detail, because this game is filled to the brim with them and it would take me ages to list all cool things it can offer.\n\nPros:\n-The Campaign is incredible, very fun, very well voice acted and scripted, easy to understand for a newcomer to the Warhammer universe, but also deep enough to be loved by long-time fans of this world.\n- The graphics are very good and, most of all, this game could run on a potato. I play on Epic setting with no problem, they did an amazing job at optimizing it.\n-The execution of insubordinate captains is amazing. I love what the crew man says to his captain before shooting him and I love the gunshot sound. The first time it happened I really felt launched into the ugly, unforgiving world that is Warhammer 40k.\n- The ship customization is astonishing. Lots of ways you can personalize every ship, from changing its passive abilities, to active. You can also give it a "special" effect coming from one of the more relevant factions of your race, improving it's abilities and getting new ones (not to mention a new, cool, look)\n- All races have their own incredible charisma and play style, it's impossible not to find one you like.\nThe Imperial Navy is the tanky, slow, hard hitting race, easy to learn but hard to master.\nThe Orks are ramming maniacs, their weapons aren't as good or accurate as other races, but you'll get your ships oneshotted by their rams if they get too close to you\nThe Eldars are the hit-and-runners, having almost no armor and no shields, they rely on fast movements to dodge incoming projectiles and carefull positioning behind enemy ships to avoid retaliation as they unleash their very strong prow weapons on them\nChaos is the "sniper". Incredibly strong from afar, but fragile in all out combat, requires a lot of kiting and manouvering to avoid getting stuck in combat with enemy ships.\n\nCons:\n- Some multiplayer games are a bit laggy, I'm not sure if it's because the other player's connection sucks or because the servers are not as good as they should be. I think the first option, tho, cause my ping is always less than 60.\n- There is some balancing to do in the various interactions between races, but the game still is way more balanced than SC2 or Total War games at launch.\n-I wish there was a way to look at the action without losing the control over the gameplay. Would be cool if they added an "action camera", a little square that appears in a corner of the screen when something cool happens, to show it in detail.\n- I love the art-work, but it gets a bit repetitive. Would be cool to have more portraits for our captains and the ability to choose between them. So that we get affectionate with them and, maybe, don't shoot them as they are warping out of combat.\n\n\nEither you love Multiplayer RTS, or you just want to SP through a good and challenging campaign, this game is for you.\nYou'll love every second you'll spend playing it.\n\nTL;DR: This game is awesome.

Speaks well of the design team.\n- Tone of the game is about right:\nCampy grimdark 40k universe? Check. Not taking itself that seriously? Check. Purging xeno scum?

Could have done more with special maps/ship etc. Advancing becomes a bit of a chore and you know for each battle you win you're going to have to do the same thing over again two or three times per turn.\n\nOverall?\nWorth picking up.

then, battlefleet gothic: Armada, here we go 'sigh'.\n\nto start off i feel like this game does justice to the universe of warhammer 40k, especially the tabletop game it was based on.\n\nbut...well...it's just something of a mess at the moment, even though the game itself plays well, has great textures and has a ok campaign, it's very reminisant of that RTS vibe 40k has for games on pc, yet it also fails on alot of points, and it's very sad for a veteran 40k player like me to see that it's kinda going down the pan like alot of other 40k games.\n\nThe grinding:\n\nleveling in battlefleet gothic is mind numbingly slow, i'd get it a good 11 hours to get everything for a SINGLE faction in skirmish/multiplayer and the harder you put it on, the longer your going to have to grind, your going to spend WAY to long on each faction, and for just the 4 factions there are at the moment it feeling very pointless, it's almost like they made it that way so you can buy your way to get the best ships. there is also the very silly ship damage system, to put it simply, if you lose a ship in a battle your not getting that ship back for probably 1-3 missions, unless you give the game your well earned ingame money to make it repair quicker or just repair it completely which can be quite hefty if you have lost alot of ships.\n\nthe micromanageing:\n\n'sigh' this is a major problems, i have never played a game with so much micromanageing, the put it in a big picture, you HAVE to be the npc to be able to perfectly manage your fleet, when your fleet has almost a dozen ships all with special abilites, turning menouvers, weapon ranges, ship angle or side checking, 'click this button to fire' weapons, and watching the battle aswell, you start to realise that the game is completely over the top for a person to do, and if you mess up you will probably end up ramming your own ships or hitting them with your own torpedos and cannons and never mind the fact that your fleet goes limp when they say destroy an enemy ship that you told them to destroy and then just do nothing (EVEN THOUGH THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLE GETTING SHOT AT).\n\nThe ability system:\n\nsee, in the tabletop game you only got to use 1 ability per turn, but in this you can just spam abilites to your hearts contempt, then just wait a bit and start spaming again, this wouldn't be a problem if the abilites wern't so overpowered, throw a load of stasis bombs and watch the entire enemy fleet just freeze while you shoot the hell out of them then watch all your shots pound into them as they can avoid them and end up totaling there capital ships or escorts, this is even worse when combind with plasma bombs or lance turrets, then there the fact that EVERY faction has the same abliltes which make no sence considering that some of those abilites don't need to be in certain factions.\n\nand finaly!\n\nThe ungodly unbalancing:\n\nhere's the thing, the beta was meant to sort out the overpowered from the underpowered, for instance, the nova cannon, also known as 'the critical existance failure cannon' which was nerfed into the not very used territory, then there was the fun perk of WMP or micro warp jump, in the beta you could jump a ship literaly into another ships path and smash then into each other like as if it was navel warfare in the greek times, but yet that was nerfed to, now you can only jump at a certain distance near another ship, so no more super warp ramming, but you see, thats just ablities and weapons, the worst part is that the stuff that needed balancing never got balanced.\n\nsee, in the multiplayer, lets say you play the imperial navy and your opponent is playing eldar corsairs and the mission is data recovery, which is basicaly nick the important stuff off each other then run away, normally this would be a balanced fun and alos quite tense game, but in reality you will get outrun, out menauvered and in some cases, out gunned, you can micromanage all you want but there is almost no way your going to win, you spend all your time running after their ship and when you finally catch up to it your opponent will just boost his way out and warp to saftey because he is outside of your striking range, or in the case of ork, just ram the crap out of your ships, and if that doesn't kill you then his torpedos or boarding assaults will cripple you to hell, then in the case of chaos, just sit out of your weapons range and send a baggillion bombers the blow up your ships, which is the same as what eldar do. but lets not forget about the imperium, just meh, there good but to be honest you'll be out-everythinged at some point.\n\nlook, im not saying the game is bad, it's just....well....not enjoyable, the problems seriously damage the fun aspect, not to mention that the trailers are VERY missleading.\nthere are no massive space battles, just small scale mini battles.\nthere is no team or friend joining, it's all random.\nand it's very hard to get used to, especially the keybinds.\n\nwhat i'll say is, the game is ok, it's not anything special, it's not really that enjoyable and it can seriously annoy you at points the multiplayer and skirmish.\nbut for a game of it's type it does quite well, the campaigns fun, the ships look FANTASTIC and look even better with a special skin which gives you a few extra skills or upgrades and i think this could be the best feeling FPS i've played in a long time.\n\nso...final verdict....what i'd say is, save your money untill they fix the major problems, at the moment it's not good, but keep checking up on it because it will eventually get sorted one way or another...but like i said, save your money for now, or get homeworld 2 remastered for roughly the same price.\n\ni'll

I would encourage people to look at Steam reviews of their two previous games Etherium and Stellar Impact.\n\nBattfleet Gothic is well presented with excellent details in the cut-scenes, and the graphics are very good. The gameplay is different to typical strategy games and involves selecting ships for a fleet to undertake a variety of different mission types, which scale in diffucluty very sharply, depending on what faction you play as or against.\n\nI really wanted to like this game after spending considerable time on the Beta. The game was originally supposed to be released on the 21st March but when the beta went live it was riddled with 'Fatal Error' bugs and crashes to desktop. The beta, which consisted of multiplayer 1 vs 1 and the first three missions of the campaign was extended to the new release date of 21st April. As things went on many of the bugs seemed to be ironed out.\n\nHowever, once the game ws finally released it became apparent that it was still riddled with bugs. I would still encounter random 'Fatal Error' crashes while playing the campaign. In addition, when trying to play multiplayer 2 vs 2 with a friend practically every other game would result in a crash to the game's main menu, or back to desktop.\n\nThe problem is that all too often I don't get to play it due to all the bugs and crashes. Just getting a multiplayer 2v2 set up with my friend takes several tries as the invite system just doesn't work. Then once in the game the chances of finishing the match are far too slim. All in all a good concept but let down by poor coding.\n\nAfter trying to play multiplayer with my friend we both decided to request Steam Support for a refund, which I hope they will honour as this is the only game I've ever requested a refund on. I would strongly suggest you save yourself the bother and avoid this game. Based on the history of Tindalos Interactive I cannot see anything changing as they never fixed the bugs on their previous two games either if you look at their reviews.\n\nPositives:\nGraphics look great\nFun gameplay\n\nNegatives:\nToo many bugs\nCant play private matches against a friend","April 23","false","214.4"," 32 of 65 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","32","65","0","0"

The difficulty level is ridiculously high! After becoming more on more frustrated with the campaign on "normal" difficulty setting, I restarted it in "easy" mode. Only it doesn't seem to change anything. I don't have a problem with (most of) the random encounters but the story missions are a bloody nightmare. Their outcome often seems to depend on random elements, which I can hardly influence. Is the main force of the enemy fleet close to my transporters when the battle starts (loss) or on the other side of the map (win)? Will my lightning strike succeed when the enemy flag ship is trying to warp out of the system (win) or will it fail (loss)? Will the bombardment positions appear close to my ships in a planetary defense mission (win) or so far away, that I am unable to reach them in time (loss). You can fight a perfect battle but at some point the game just seems to say: Screw you, I'm going to set you a goal, that you cannot possibly achieve.\n\nOf course, you cannot just restart a battle when it is lost. No, you have to limp out, listen to your superior's whining, reload the last save game, and then click through all the dialogues, cut scenes and preparations again. Sigh.\n\nYes, you can live with a loss or two and still continue playing the campaign but the loss in experience and renown will make future battles even harder. I will keep trying but at the moment I'm extremely frustrated with this game.","April 24","false","37.8"," 26 of 53 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","26","53","0","3"

This is a good game, nevermind the nice and true rendition of the Warhammer 40k / Gothic universe. Secondly, in my mind a game should be rated on its own merits, not how it is compared to others. The game is fine, and somewhat cheap. I wouldn't recommend it at the current state as there seems to be some minor issues, which I personally feel leads to a lot of frustration.\n\nMissions\nThere's several different missions you can play. Each mission is divided into the defender and the attacker possition. There's; Breakthrough, Planetary Assault, Cruiser Clash, Data Revocery, Asssasination, Station-Assault and Convoy.\nMy biggest issue is that these missions clearly have a faivored race, meaning that some races are a lot better in specific missions. Some players argue on the forums that it isn't unbalanced, but rather a question of skills- If you're one of those elitist gamers, you'd problably agree and you should ignore this comment (and the rest for that matter).\n\nCampaign\nI've been waiting like a small child anticipating christmas, once I got to the end in the beta version. The graphics are great and all that, but what it comes down to is basically the issue with the missions. In the campaign you play an imperial commander and slowly advance in their order. On the mission table you then have to chose which planets you'd like to travel to and then complete a given assignment. Each round you have a given number of deployments that dictate how many missions you can take. Each misssion (win or loss) uses a deployment, and you "end turn" in order to get more. All assignments come in the form of the previously mentioned mission-types. This clearly leads to a lot of frustation, when you realize that some missions are close to impossible (atleast for a mortal-gamer). This means you can either take the "easy" missions or use your deployments to try and complete a specific task. Since the chances for losing a ship is increased by a substantial amount in the tricky ones, you also have to take into account that you might have to ignore remaining deployments since your valuable ships are all destroyed, lost in the wap or repaired.\n\nMultiplayer\nThe game finds, and starts multiplayer games quickly, that's a pro. But my personal experience constantly matches me with higher level ships, that's a big con! I realize this might have something to do with the amount of current players, but nevertheless it can be frustrating, since the chances that you lose your ships (one way or another) you'd be struggeling in the match right after. Also as some already have mentioned there is a slowmotion effect, I think was initially designed for the campaign, but when an opponent uses this, everything slows down and you have that to combatent aswel.\n\nIt's not that this is a bad game all the way through, I just think there are too many bulletpoint that can frustrate a gamer, which leads the experience of this game into a more raging than comforting one. The graphics are great, although it would be nice with the possibility to skip the introscene to every battle. After the 15th game, people know how their ships look like. For some reason the game doesn't autosave after each game, which is also somewhat strange. Why would anyone take a defeat if they had a chance to retry the map?\n\nHopefully some of these issues will be fixed in the time to come. If I happen to notice it, I will also edit this thread.\nWith all this being said, I will continue to play this game - atleast till next month where a lot of great-looking games will be released. I do have a feeling, that I'm not the only one. So hopefully when that times comes, this game is able to compete otherwise I'm quite sure the community will deminish.","April 23","false","81.3"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","9","19","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Titler/recommended/363680/","Titler","Titler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Titler/","157 products in account","Not quite ready for release, but the positive reviews won't tell you this. A purchase now is buying an incomplete, and in many ways horribly broken game.\n\nThe main issue is that the campaign uses the unit balance for Multiplayer, and that is horrendously out of whack currently. And as the Imperium of Man tends to suffer the worst of this, and you only get an Imperium campaign, this ensures that immediately after the tutorial ends the average player will have to save-scum constantly to beat incredibly unfair fights because the units used against them are faster, have longer range and more assault capabilities.\n\nAs you only get a limited amount of fights you can take per week, and already by Week 5 even with a perfect save-scummed game you have to allow a system to be lost, this means that the campaign can literally become literally unwinnable very, very quickly indeed.\n\nThe campaign itself has some lovely cutscenes, but because it really is just the multiplayer re-skinned with the odd stationary objective added in, it doesn't currently have any real gameplay feel that would make it compelling to grind your way through it's poor balancing.\n\nMultiplayer has proven more fun for me, because I don't play as the Imperium, but rather as Orkz. And now it's been patched in, only in 2v2 as having team mates averages out the imbalance issues. But even here, the poor state of release is blatantly obvious. There's no ability to type only to your team mate, for instance...\n\nBut the big one, and one which will absolutely destroy the online community, is that it's possible at any time for a team mate to concede the match on behalf of the entire team, with no vote mechanism or way to keep playing. I've actually been winning a match, but because my team mate died and didn't want to sit and watch until I finished it, he threw the game and gave us both the loss and took away my rewards for the destruction I had and would have finished wreaking. It's a perfect trolling mechanism; you can join teams just to frustrate others if you wish.\n\nAnd sometimes the game hangs even trying to start a match. And the races the players are using at the team set up stage aren't the ones they actually have (so you can choose the wrong fleet set up to tackle them). And the text box is duplicated in the middle of the fleet set up screen for some reason.\n\nThat's not to say when the game works, is fair, and played in good spirits it isn't great fun... I've loved the roleplaying and rammin' head bangin' battles I've had online with people. But the game just isnt READY yet. When it's balanced, patched, and given a few more months love, I'll come back to this review and change it.\n\nBut that gets into the last issue I need to bring up; because they've chosen to declare that it's launch now, that means that in a few months when the game may be much more polished, you won't get the DLC for free any more. Also even if you purchase the game now, unless you do so from specific vendors, you won't get the DLC for free at all. The currently confirmed stores are the official Focus store, Steam, Gamesplanet and Amazon.de  I find this constant degrading of the respect for the public, and the ever increasing manipulation of them to squeeze ever more profit out of them highly distasteful.  I do not regret buying in early, because I've had hours of Orky fun online in my own way, but there's no denying that as an all-round product here and now, it's just not complete enough or polished enough to justify either a full price release and especially not to deny people the chance at content because of an arbitrary financial decision to claim it's now launched.\n\nFor now, just be very aware of what the game actually IS if you wish to risk purchasing it; it's still effectively an incomplete beta product at this point. The campaign isn't working very well, online support is flakey at best, and whilst there's fun to be had, you have to focus on a very narrow viewpoint to find it.","April 23","false","106.5"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Bought it at Beta, been playing it since.. Launch fixed and broke a lot of things..\n\nThe Good:\n--The critical system is a little less random at high health now. (believe me, this is good.)\n--Ships for each race move and feel very unique.\n--Chaos got buffed.\n--Good art.\n--Ships are wonderful to look at, shoot with, and blow up.\n--RAMMING.\n--Ships have inertia, so turns are almost always MUCH wider than you might expect.\n--Story Follows the 12-13th Black Crusades from GW's Eye of Terror World Wide Campaign\n(good story)\n\nThe Bad:\n---EVE-Online AI Move options ('go here then stop and shoot' or 'circle and shoot with broadsides only.')\nthis doesnt help anyone that has forward firing guns, which is good because...\n---Eldar. They got nurfed hard. This isnt totally a bad thing as they were nearly unkillable during beta, but now they are fragile and take significantly more damage from macrobattery ships even with full defence buff, and since they are insanely fragile, they have become insane glass  cannons.\n---Truely horrible player-side AI. Some of the AI's pathing choices are down right awful, especially when playing less tanky races like chaos and eldar where stuff needs to be doing the right thing, or its dead.\nhalf the time you will be babying your line ships only to find an escort found a minefield and still decided to fly though it, or, instead of turning AWAY from a closing enemy ship, it will turn towards it while on auto, or worse, toward a near by ally, creating evil micromanagement hell. Thank god for bullet-time, but even that wont save you all the time.\n---Strike Craft. these are.. not great. worse, only a few ships carry them and they are kinda dedicated to it.\n-Fighters are redundent.\n-Boarding Pods are good but iffy.\n-Bombers are lackluster against anything other than escorts.\nWith No counter to keep track of reamining craft so its kind of a crap shoot how many runs they will get before they are out (yes very much like the tabletop, just bombers are way less rewarding).\n---Would really have liked to see ships that are assigned a numbered group sticking in formation - moving the same way, changing facing the same way, staying together, while not smashing into each other, and being able to fire similar weapons at the same time..\n---They got rid of hotkeying groups?\n\nTL;DR\n\nIts not a bad game, but its not a great game. Its based heavily on awesome movement mechanics but there are very few options that allow you to make use of them effectively, and as you scale into larger and larger fleet battles simply making your fleet do what you want gets compoundingly more brutal.","April 22","false","24.2"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

The game is good for the most part: good tutorial, easy to understand, epic voice acting and atmosphere. The thing that ruined it for me though is the timed mission objectives.\n\nLet me explain: the game is basically slow-paced with meticulous movement control of the ships. I mean just turning ships around takes like forever. The thing about timed objectives (like planetary bombardment, data recovery, or assasination) is that they need you to move too fast. For assasination or similar missions, at least you kind of know when the timer for the warp will start (when you damage the target ship heavily or steal the data or whatever), so you can kind of plan for it. But even if you do, there is no guarantee your abilities to stop the warp would work, and if it fails you kind of need to have a second ship in range with it's ability cooldown ready, and even then there is no guarantee. As for objectives like bombardment, you kind of need to know where the objective will appear before it does, else you probably won't be there in time.\n\nAlso unskippable in-game cutscenes are a problem, especially when you fail a mission..which is most of the time for me. For a game of such a slow pace and limited tools, the mission objectives feel like they're from another game..they're really not compatible.\n\nTLDR: cool game but missions objectives often contradict game philosiphy and design.","April 24","false","21.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

Forget the trailers because nothing like that actually happens in game and versing the same 4 factions becomes completely boring. Weird planets, glowing scenery and ♥♥♥♥ becomes annoying to your eyes especially when they are placed underneath a grid map (which looks like a rip off of the battle ships board game), becoming distracting.

Warping out of a battle. A couple of game modes are basically just a race to warping out and once your opponent begins you don't have very goods odds of stopping it, even on easy. To even have a chance you must reserve your boarding actions because the cool downs are so long you won't even have an opportunity to try to stop the enemy ship from warping out. That puts you at a real disadvantage, and makes several game modes an absolute drag to attempt.\n\nCampaign starts of well enough but doesn't do a great job of explaining everything involved.\n\nThis game isn't terrible, not at all, but the balancing of cool downs and mission objectives just make it a grind.","May 1","false","30.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

This is a quick match RTS game, similar to DoW2 in many ways, replace Space Marines on the ground for Imperial Ships in the space, and you got it. Which is a good thing, like I said, it gets the itch taken care of, since it will be another 15 years before we might see DoW3.\n\nYes its not perfect... but if you are looking for a singleplayer run where most missions are 3 to 6 mins long, then this does it well.

No prob generators and engines down.  One problem the target is not alone. he has at least 3 buddys happy to steal the data and jump out all while you sit there waiting for your cooldowns to be ready to stop them from jumping...30 secs after they jump out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cylarne04/recommended/363680/","cylarne04","Lord Cylarne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cylarne04/","44 products in account","Do I recommend this game? I think I neither do or don't. But if I was forced to pick one over the other, I'd slightly lean more towards yes, because it is the ONLY BFG game out there. Now, Battlefleet Gothic has plenty of great experiences don't get me wrong, however there are some experiences that are not so good. Let me tell you all about it.\n\nThe game is based on small fleet management where you can upgrade your vessels one by one at the cost of renown. To get renown, you win or lose battles by playing a match. However if you lose, there will be a cost at the same time rewarded (rewarded by failing? I like!). Eye and ear candy is everywhere to be seen. However, your brain will hurt at times as this game requires too much thinking and upgrading your ships from the shipyard is actually not how it should be. Dive into semi decent gameplay where half of the controls are missing, but it's ok as you just watched epic cutscenes. Popcorn required.\n\nVisuals/art/animations/graphics: - 12/10\nImmersion: 10/10\nVoice Acting: + 1 (bonus)\n\nGINORMOUS EFFORT! Mind blowing wows with extra points. Just throw a trailer into that intro ALONE. HERE! TAKE MY MONEY! By the love of gawd epic. And the cutscenes throughout the campaign maintains same level of quality. Skippable. Voice acting is god.\n\nCampaign: 10/10\nTutorial: 3.5/10\n\nNow here is why the campaign is almost perfect. You can die and still be rewarded. The campaign is tough, tougher than side missions, and if you fail them, you'll pay the price and don't need to start over at the same time. You don't need to replay anything. You can continue with your failures or load up the last game where you succeeded. On top of this, the devs included both failure and success cutscenes for dynamic plot. And you can choose where to attack or what planets to save. If you fail, you get one more chance to succeed! I'm not done with the campaign, but I see me finishing it in the future.\n\nSo the campaign is great except for this one little catch: An unskippable tutorial! The tutorial in this game is scary. "You must complete this mission to move on. Or else, you will never... ever experience the campaign, MWA HA HA" It holds your hands forcing you to do this and this and although it has voice acting which is good to lower the learning curve, the tutorial is boring. "Well, all tutorials are not supposed be fun." you may say. Again may I say it is not skippable. If you played the beta, you'll feel my PAIN. You'll need to play the campaign over again. And believe me, if you die in this mission (which is really EASY), you will need to start over and repeat steps 1-death. It is frustrating.\n\nAI: 8/10\nBalance: 10/10\n\nFeels very balanced. The costs of things you purchase versus the how they compete is well done. AI is well done. However, haha, you gotta work on how they move through asteroids. On "Destroy Convoy" missions, the AI sends their convoy through asteroids, blow up, and I don't have to do anything. Easy victory.\n\nGameplay: 5/10\nMechanics: 3/10\nReplayability: 6/10\nShip Customization: 7/10\nLearning Curve: 9/10\n\nHere is the part where the game feels like it is falling apart. I played so far 17 matches (campaign + skirmish). Gameplay is only average. Through the aesthetics, sounds, and what not, gameplay in this category is hidden by the sheer masterpiece of aesthetics and sound. It is only slightly better than Star Wars: Battlefront, where this game has a similarity with it. The game feels like it is trying to hide the gameplay because the coder can't come up with better ideas to make it more fun (no offense). And here is what I mean by this: Do you ever feel like something is missing from PLAYING the game? How much fun do you actually have battling other ships every single match? It's immersive, but slow. And no I do not mean "Cogitators" slow, I mean there is boredom in gameplay. There is no large fleets, there is no massive battles. It feels like you are forced to micro or you WILL lose.\n\nMechanics, there are a lot of things missing. Control groups are missing. Queued moves? Missing. Shift key irrelevant. Hotkeys are most likely missing. No way to select all ships, no way to attack move, and reliance on tactical gogitators 24/7. To get massive fleets will take ages, tons of dedication. Where are your controllable fighter units? Why do you have to micro everything?\n\nReplayability, besides the campaign, leveling up to get the best stuff, there is ok value of achievement. You do not become god, though, and like I said, fielding massive fleets in this game is impossible or at least stupid as you have to micro EVERYTHING. Throughout time when you get better stuff, your enemy will too. And the progression, the difficulty only gets harder and harder as you go up in rank as your enemies do as well. Though there are options to choose how many ships you want to field, and the bonus of renown. But overall the game needs work as I kind of feel tired of playing this game over and over again.\n\nShip customization is good, but could be better. I would like it better, if I can choose how many upgrades I want to upgrade at the cost of renown, instead of waiting level after level to get this and then that. Feels wonky. And, and, where is my true ship customization? I want lasers fired out from the sides or give my ships more guns! Like lascannons, meltas, plasma batteries, whatever weapon I want. Not there. You cannot customize your ship visually. Instead, you have to choose between a bunch of ships and you can't scrap any for renown or get more slots whenever you want.\n\nLearning curve is good. However, I sure would like to know a better way to navigate around the map or select units outside of my camera.\n\nOVERALL: 7.8/10\n\nIt's good. Could be better, but still a good game. So I recommend it. However, do not kill people over this game. If you have a lot of money, and you want to have a nice Battlefleet Gothic experience, then this game is for you. But do not expect to be playing it 24/7. Watching it on youtube let's plays is also recommended to get you the feel of the game before buying it. Overall this game was well made, but I hope there are mods out there and/or patches to fix what is missing.

I played Tabletop Battlefleet and I loved that too, so I was excited for this game.\n\nUnfortunately here's the big issues:\n-The bugs in this game make it almost unplayable. Skills bug, renders your ships useless, screen bug so you move your screen around to see your ships..etc\n- Pairing up in PvP ends in someone always quitting, even if you have a chance to pull it out 1v2, nope they just want to play the next game and force you to forfeit, even if they aren't on the map anymore.\n- Eldar players get the battleship, then pick nothing else and theres nothing you can do. it turns into a MOBA for them and a strategy game for you. Goodluck trying to fight your way out of that.\n- Battleships dont have their own Mission point requirement, in other terms If I wanted I could just run a BS the whole time. Your cruisers and light cruisers get crushed, and I kinda just take damage. GG, this can be balanced out by mandating you need a cruiser or above before you can field a battleship, otherwise its just broken, Especially vs two eldar in PvP....uuugggghh.\n- Orks need taunt on all their ships to be effective, this should come passively....they're Orks.\n\nAfter the basic glitches actually get refined out, this game will be worth it. Otherwise, I'd hold off.\n\n*Edited*\nadding to the list of things they still need to fix:\n- A Team chat\n- 5 out of 13 matches end in Fatal game errors due to a screen glitch, but might be different per person.","April 29","false","34.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Unless they're all blocked until the beta is over.\n\nThis game is fanatastic, while I haven't played the multiplayer, and stuck to the solo skirmish, I can honestly say that the mechanics are solid, I haven't experienced a single bug.\n\nThe ship customisation is solid, with numerous upgrades to the ships performance; although a limited number to each ship, forcing specialisation, but hey, no ship should be the ultimate upgraded beast form which you can deliver the Emperors Light in a competitive multiplayer game that also has a fully fleshed out campaign much like dawn of war 2's and dark crusade.\n\nThe ships, and the races (Imperium and Chaos as of the beta) are true to the lore and TT game for the most part, and they certainly have different play styles.\n\nTo win a battle you need strategy and tactics, as well as a good understanding of each ship in your fleet, and playing well to it's role. The battles are surprisingly fast, and hectic, a lot can be going on, and you need to keep track of it all. Which comes to point, the "tactical cogitators" the ability to slow down time, of course, during multiplayer, if one person slows down time, everyone goes slow mo, until the initiator turns it off, leaving room for potential trolls.\n\nOne thing I MUST point out is the AI, it's fantastic, the guys behind this AI needs an applaus. It thinks, it plans, it reacts. Example; Whilst playing a round of Data Extaction (I think that's the name) a sort of, hold the "ball" and GTFO game mode. I managed to get the data on my ship, as I'm running away, and about to GTFO via warp, just as my ship jumps to warpspace, they steal the data, and in the midst of the cluster**** I thought I'd won, then the ship warped out immediately after taking it, and BAM! game over, I lost.\n\nSo the AI, saw a situation, planned an action, queued commands, and thus won the match. In a way I simply could not have forseen or countered. You could say this was dumb luck, but I've seen it do this exact tactic, twice since, and my god does it make me rage every time.\n\nAlso, the Orks are immense fun, just throw everything you have at the enemy face first and bash them with you big red button.

First is bugs (which I haven't run into a single one) and the second is difficulty(which isn't a bad thing, but there is no problem as you can set most abilities to auto-fire which helps you to keep up).\n\nAnyway, onto the review. (I have never played the tabletop version but) this game is brilliant. Naval combat in space with incredibly cinematic gameplay, which hasn't detracted from the strategic element at all. Not sure how long the campaign is, but is shaping up to be a good length and there are mini randomised campaigns for all the factions so you can play around their ships too.\n\nIt is relatively straight forward to get into, but there where a few things that I learnt the hard way (do not take the eldar head on, or they will savagely ♥♥♥♥ you, hard turn and continue to ♥♥♥♥ you).\nThere are a several ship varieties and variants within those to choose from which threw me a little to begin with, but with after playing a bit more I am catching on.\n\n(For all you 40k fans, there is plenty of 'By/For the Emperor' and all that good stuff too.)\n\nEasily a 8/10","April 25","true","21.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Had a blast....until some issues started popping up.\n\n1 - After winning 6 or 7 matches, our party was dropped, and we couldn't team back up. Restarted client, rebooted steam, tried everything we could. No dice\n\n2 - If one players drops out of the game (i.e ragequits) then NO ONE gets anything for the match. Happened when I got DC'd from a match. Had a chaos player rage quit twice, 1 ship left, had destroyed 5-6 ships, got zero renown and xp for a 10 minute fight.\n\n3 - No team chat? Maybe I'm just being stupid and missing it, but it's very hard to coordinate with pugs when you can't talk to them directly.\n\nSo far, the core game seems solid. But these issues make it really un-enjoyable. It's extremely frustrating to be chasing a chaos or eldar player around the map for 5 minutes, and when they realize they can't win, it's alt+f4 and I get nothing in the match.

They went out of their way to capture the feel of the grim dark WH40K universe, the artwork and models are loyal to the source material and really beautiful, the different factions do actually play differently and aren't just reskins, the tall ship style combat is very enjoyable and satisfying, the harder difficulties are legitimately challenging, and the campaign is superb.  I don't really do multiplayer, but I've played a lot of solo skirmish and have been through the campaign twice (have all the campaign achievements).

As the hordes and fleets decend against the sector, you can't be in every place at once on the grand strategy map. Every loss is a penalty and basically you are choosing how bad it is going to get for you and where. It makes you feel deep into the lore as vital worlds fall because you were off defending another (also vital) planet.  And that's just the grand strategy!

The story is constantly reminding you about the grand scale of the war with dozens of ships being lost in battles, but the actual battles you're in have 5-6 ships at the most in them. Even in the final battle, the entire fleet of both sides is laughably puny. There also comes a point in the game where you realize that most of the skills can be set on autocast and all you have to do is focus down enemies, which takes a lot of the tactics out of it.\n\n\nI loved this game, and I already can't wait for BFG2 or any expansions they make.","May 28","true","73.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","1","3","2","0"

I tried to like it so much that I played past the 2 hour steam refund just to give it extra chances to prove its worth.\n\nI'm not saying that it is impossible to win, like many others... I'm just not having any _fun_ playing it. The mechanics are in general confusing, but that might just be on my end *insulting my own cognitive abilities so that you don't have to*, I have yet to see any resemblance of finer tactics other than "ramming is good".\n\nYes, I only have 4 hours under my belt in this game and my conclusions might be unjust because of that. But if a game becomes _work_ it loses its value of entertainment.\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nI have given the game znother chance and another 6 hours. It is playable. I had to swallow my pride and play on easy difficulty... something I have not done in ages. But at that level I find just the right amout of challange and I've finnaly found a playstyle that I like.\n\nIt is a good game. Not amazing or a 10/10... But it works.

I thought; "all good, i've extinguised the fires with emergency repairs, i have enough time to destroy/inhibit them with my ordenane, macro-cannons and supporting abilities" before they can seriously damage my battleship.\n\nLittle did Skuzzles here know, the cooldown on their pulsars was a measly 26.4 seconds.  In stark contrast to the 39.6 second cooldown (fully upgraded servitors) of imperial torpedos, which are harder to hit, and do less damage.\n\n10/10 would be utterly destroyed by pulsars again.  Pls nerf [interactives] ;~;","June 6","true","110.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Certain compartments of the ships can be crippled (weapons, command deck, engines) which will limit it's effectiveness throughout the battle. The unique abilities and upgrades you can provide the ships and their crew are always fun to explore and experiment with: such as stasis bombs which trap everything in a bubble for about 15 seconds (torpedoes, ships, even fighters and cannon shells) and teleportation drives to instantly manouver around enemies.\nPositioning is a major part of the strategies, similar to 18th century naval warfare and being caught in a bad location can be tricky to overcome.\nThe game's 4 factions: Imperials, Chaos, Orks and Eldar are all unique with their own playstyle and capture the tabletop game beautifully. As somebody who sadly didn't have the chance to play that before GW ended production (god knows why) I can't thank these guys engough for this. Most of the devs are long-time 40K fans and truly went out of their way to do the IP justice\nI would highly recommend this to any warhammer fan (if they've not played this already) and to anybody who is interested in space combat strategy games.\n10 / 10","June 6","true","41.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
