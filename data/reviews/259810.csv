Each puzzle is not too difficult to solve, but dose get quite challenging as you move on to the next one. I recon I got my money's worth, But would prefere an Xbox controller to move and jump my sheepy's. You have 3 sheep to control with one at a time, to help solve the puzzle and move along to next stage.( The big sheep need's shearing though ;D ).  LOVE THIS GAME IT'S FUN and FRUSTRATING all in one package.

Each level is small and simple so even if you get stuck it shouldn't be for long. The gameplay is slick, with each level having multiple targets (time and collectibles), and there are plenty of fair achievements to earn. And if you are a fan of Shaun the Sheep you will get a kick from the visual style too. Downsides? A bit on the short side, but for the budget price it's still decent value.","February 23, 2014","true","16.0"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fakesecret/recommended/259810/","fakesecret","FakeSecret","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fakesecret/","682 products in account","I highly recommend this indie game, especailly to those who love solving puzzles. Three sheep, a long exciting journey, 3 different episodes, one hundred of stuff to collect, 15 serect levels, 180 stars to beat and more interesting achievements to explore. This game is both for children and adults, not hard to play but quite creative. I also appreciate its art style and music. For achivement hunters, I should say the prefection takes you 5 hours, but definitely worthy.\n\n这是一部上上品的独立解密游戏，在这里我强烈推荐。里面讲述了3只羊的冒险故事，故事分为背景迥异的三章，很多元素等待你去收集（故事情节相关而且不变态），每关3颗星（比较简单），还有15个隐藏关卡。一些有意思的成就是让你用些别样的方式来通关。这些特点在一起使得这款游戏非常具有创造性，但是并没有使游戏过于困难。游戏的画面风格和音乐也不错哦。对于成就党来说，这个游戏只需花你5个小时，但是绝对超值。","April 21, 2014","true","5.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/259810/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Surprisingly fun little game. It is a puzzle game, which I usually don't like, but after having played a crappy one (logigun) that did everything the wrong way, this game got it right. The art and music were nice. There was not really a story but that's not a big deal. The humor was good. It was nice how each sheep has its own abilities, you'll start to get to know them for that and develp a favorite. It is also cool how each one makes its own sound. Unlike that crap logigun game, the puzzles are well done. Instead of a giant room with 12 switches, 15 moveable boxes, 10 lazers, and only 1 single solution the creators made so you have to figure out the exact order they want you to do it so you can beat the level, which takes 30 minutes of looking and isn't intuitive, this game is the opposite. The puzzles are clever, require reasoning and logic, and can actually be solved multiple ways (some of them). Once again, as opposed to the logigun game, you are not in just a single boring looking nondescript room, each level has different setting and objectives and you operate different machinery, so it actually feels like the puzzles has a purpose instead of just "open final door". There are 3 episodes which are each differently themed. The variety kept everything interesting, and it wasn't just stupidly over hard for the sake of being so (logigun......sorry I just played the game right before this so I am drawing all my comparisons). The game was kind of short though and I guess you can play a similar version online for free on a flash website. 7/10","February 14, 2015","true","2.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The three sheeps Shaun, Timmy and Shirly, each with own abilities (strong and fat - small - thin and elegant), go through 3 different environments (Underground, London, Space) in varying types of puzzles. The positive thing is that there is no given solution, more are often possible. The puzzles are not too difficult until the last levels, the backgrounds are wonderfully illustrated in the style of the movies, and if you are stuck are helping system avoids too much a frustration.\nThere are lots of achievements and collectables and together with the puzzles there is a brilliant gaming flow created.\nSome info concerning the free flash version: the Steam one has 2/3 more levels + 15 Bonuslevels, HD sound and graphics, so no way to complain to have 9 hours fun for 10 bucks (the replay value is really poor, especially if one has achieved all the goals). Besides this there are no trading cards.\nFazit: Amusing little game with a lot of sheepy puzzles and noises!","June 30, 2015","true","9.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You would have to be really young to get some enjoyment out of these levels.\nThere's also less items to collect and less bonus levels\nChapter 3 - Lost in space\nMore of a return to what makes the first chapter good\nwith more hidden items, more references and bonus levels, which all together gives you something closer to a challenge than the previous chapter.\nthis chapter is mostly about teleport swaps.\nMy initial question was rhetorical, ofc you should support this game, its clever, its funny and it provides a decent challenge.\nThe original price is a bit to high, but if its discounted or bundled i recommend picking it up, more so if you are looking for something worthwhile for kids","December 17, 2015","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For people who either dislike sheep, shaun the sheep or games that are "simple" should try to make an achievement run - and then tell me again, this game is far too easy.\n\nTiming is sometimes very important, so it can be a real challenge at times.
