"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/60800/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1196 products in account","I've been trying really hard to like this game from the moment that I started playing. With each passing encounter, with each newly introduced event, with each new NPC speaking and each logic flaw in either narrative or combat; my task grew to become harder and harder. Finally, I give up. This is the day that I'll leave an RPG unfinished.\n\nAs the curtain opens, we watch a cinematic about a legendary artifact; the Sickle of Chronos being stolen. Then, we choose between two 12 year old siblings - one male and one female - to take as our character, and begin playing a pesteringly long, somewhat illogical and predictable prequel story. By the end of the prequel, our "hero" is given the "choice" of becoming the champion of one of the 9 Olympian Gods to compete in a contest. If she/he prevails, her/his one wish will be granted by the gods. To accomplish this deed, our hero is sent to the Island of Machantar to the main temple of his/her deity. After that point, our hero will venture out on an unending journey of hack & slash to acquire that accursed sickle.\n\nNumen: Contest of Heroes is a single player 3D RPG in a run on the mill MMO model - which is based on fetch quests or killing a certain amount of monsters to get a certain drop - with the skill bar, mobs to kill and levels to gain. You slay monsters, gain level and loot, travel to new areas with tougher monsters and so on and on... which would be quite alright if it wouldn't be for a couple of downers. To begin with, the storyline is botched, with you always ending up aimlessly wandering around to try and discover "what to do next". Quest indicators fail to present pointers or direct towards locations. Any and all areas of the game are open, so it wouldn't differ whether you are level 20 or 80, you can always find a mob to get yourself killed by accidentally.\n\nThere is a monstrous imbalance between classes; warrior being overpowering, mage being somewhat decent and archer being completely pointless. Skill and item usage are completely laggy; you end up pushing a hot key 2-3 times before the game decides to cast that spell and by then - guess what? - You are usually dead. There is no actual lore to gods or no differentiating factor between gods, so your choice of whomever you decided to follow there is somewhat irrelevant. The game fails to deliver any kind of authentic lore: there are Greek names and figures thrown around, bravo. As if that would be enough for a setting. Aside the main scenario - and a vague one at that - side quests are not many, and they end up popping around in completely imbalanced levels. Dialogue is forced, unimaginative and usually contains a couple of typos anyhow. Arena battles or tournaments rely on luck and how laggy your casting would be instead of actual skill and reflexes. Oh, and as far as atmosphere goes: graphics and textures are okay - with no facial or physical customization option for your character, and the soundtrack decides to take long pauses of silence as you play for no apparent reason.\n\nPhew, sorry. I hate being thoroughly this negative, but Numen: Contest of Heroes would be a somewhat acceptable MMORPG. As a single player RPG, it fails to deliver either interest in story, any character or scenario involvement, decent game or combat mechanics or basically any good time. I remember having better time with Metin 2. That was multiplayer at least. When I bought this game, it was on sale for 99 cents so it's not a big loss, but if you are interested in an Action RPG in a Greek Setting, Titan Quest is most definitely a better choice. Good day.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","December 9, 2015","false","8.9"," 41 of 47 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","41","47","0","7"

The item and level grinding is boring, it lacks in story and especially in side quests and the level 'design' is pretty much non-existant. Most of the game looks more random than Diablo while it isn't. While the game isn't a complete waste of time and has some moments, the lack of speech for the few NPCs, the mindnumbing and pointless arena fights and a lot of other small details make the game very dull and sometimes tedious to play. There's just so many better Diablo clones around and this one is hardly worth anybody's time. The final battle is a joke compared to the other boss fights. So many design flaws in one game that it's almost a candidate for a rotten tomato award... Unless you're extremely bored and have nothing better to play, stay away from this game.","December 9, 2013","false","8.8"," 63 of 84 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","63","84","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalirion/recommended/60800/","kalirion","kalirion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalirion/","2884 products in account","Numen: Contest of Heroes  basically plays like a single player MMO, complete with hotkey bar, ability cooldowns, and combat that doesn't feel like it's quite connecting.   It isn't a great game, but it's at least a decent one, and well worth the huge sale prices I've seen it (currently $0.99 as I write this review.)  I myself picked it up for $7.50 soon after release, and don't really regret it, though $5 or less is the sweet spot here IMO.\n\nThe introductory / tutorial section is pretty boring, but persevere and the game becomes more enjoyable later.  You start out as a kid, and through a few quests learn the basics of the three primary classes - Warrior, Archer and Mage.  At the end of the tutorial you get to pick which of the three classes you want to become, and appear as a leveled up adult with only the abilities of the chosen class.  At the same time you also pick which God to worship, granting you additional abilities and bonuses, which increase as you make your God more proud of you through your actions.\n\nThen it's standard fantasy RPG fare.  You go on quests, trigger events which advance the plotline, unlock new areas and make more quests available, kill monsters to level up and get better loot, and eventually kill the final boss and beat the game.  You encounter other heroes along the way and choose whether to help, hinder or ignore them.  And there's an Arena tournament event where you can fight these heroes as well.\n\nThe balance seems a bit off in some areas.  A couple times you can be thrown into a new area severely underlevelled for the enemies, and have to grind before you can take on more than one of them at a time.  Then 3/4 of the way through you find that 90% of your attacks are critical hits and enemies don't stand a chance as long as you don't get careless.\n\nOverall I'd recommend the game when it's on sale, though not at the base $9.99 price.","February 28, 2014","true","31.7"," 53 of 70 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","53","70","0","4"

I bought it on sale for 79 cents on a whim and I'm sure glad I did.\n\nIt looks like Titans Quest, but It plays very much like an MMO. Tab targeting, auto-attack, skills hotbar, camps of mobs you have to carefully pull, etc. If you aren't in to MMO-style combat, you may not like this. The combat reminds me of Vanguard and several others. Fights are quicker though, mobs your level usually die in 10-15 seconds.\n\nThe leveling is relatively fast so far. I've been playing about 6 hours and am level 31. I did grind out a couple of levels once to make an area easier, but it only took about 10 minutes.\n\nA big plus for me is that there are 16 item slots, including four ring slots. I prefer many slots and slower upgrades rather than constant upgrades to 6 or 8 slots.\n\nOne of the things I didn't like about it are the slow walking speed when you first start the game as a child. But once you leave the tutorial island and become an adult, the walking speed is very good.\n\nAnother thing I don't care for is the day/night system. You have to find a campfire to rest, with the option of resting to restore stamina only, or until morning or evening. It seemed like I had to rest until night time to make one quest mob appear but there was no indication of this that I saw so I roamed around looking for him before trying to wait until night time. So far, this was the only time day or night mattered, other than picking some flowers on the tutorial island, and you are told to do that at night.\n\nThe last thing is the save system. You can only save at one of the campfires. There are plenty of them around so this is not a big issue for me, but a "save anywhere" would be nice.\n\nI only went to the arena for a few minutes and it was kind of weird and not all that fun, so hopefully it'll be mostly optional.\n\nThe graphics are on par with most MMO graphics and the sound is adequate but there is not a lot of music.\n\nHaving finished all other RPG's that interest me, and being between MMO's at the moment, I'm having a lot of fun with this. I would have easily paid the full $7.99 for it had I realized what it actually was.\n\nEdit:\n\n1) I finished the game in 13 hours at level 80.\n\n2) The arena is optional. I never went there again and only lost a little favor with the gods for missing a tournament.\n\n3) The night/day thing was not a big deal. There are 3-4 times someone or something will only appear at night.\n\n4) A couple of the quests are a bit vague. I consulted a walkthrough a few times.\n\n5) It did crash on me twice, both times after saving and entering a new zone.\n\nIt was still probably the most fun I've ever had for 79 cents, and is well worth even full price, imo, if you can overlook a few minor issues.","January 1, 2015","true","18.8"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

I'm sure you can get this game for a dollar during a sale, and I'd say it's worth it at that point. Besides that, it's a low-budget, not quite horrendous but still not-good RPG with an ancient Greek aesthetic. For some reason, it plays exactly like an MMO in spite of its being single-player only, and the titular contest comes down to you dueling one or two NPCs over the course of the game. But if the struggle is real, there are far worse games to spend a dollar on.","December 27, 2014","false","22.3"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","20","27","0","0"

I thankfully got it on sale for very cheap, but I'm still unquestionably disappointed. After one playthrough, anyone would be able to notice that this game has many, many faults. Pretty unforgivable faults, especially since it's so expensive (relative to the quality, that is): Bland textures and animations, dull, boring gameplay, and a silly, confusing storyline. The developers made the mistake of substituting true, engaging gameplay moments--quests, fights, anything--for easy-to-implement, overdone bloat. I'm talkin' fetch quests, more or less forced grinding, and unintuitive mechanics. I think there was a very small few fun moments, but... they aren't even remotely as abundant as the bland moments. On top of all this, this game's ending is... awful. Just awful. It's honestly, sincerely pathetic. Like, if you're a game developer or wish to become one, I'd recommend you play this game just to see the ending find footage of the ending and see a perfect example of how NOT to end a game. An abysmal ending on top of an already mostly mediocre game? Sounds like rubbish to me.\n\nIt's sad, too, because I really wanted to like it. An under-the-radar RPG with a Greek mythological setting? Yes, please! Unfortunately, this did not deliver. At all.

I bought it back around the time it released for full price, and I never regretted it.  And even now years later I look back fondly on this game.\nI think I may play it again as one of the other classes...\nYou can choose three basic classes - warrior, ranger, mage.  Later on you get to choose your god based on which class you choose (3 per class iirc).  These choices add certain other abilities.  But they do not seem to make a ton of difference from what I saw.  But it was still a neat idea.\n\nThe game is fairly basic, and the combat lacks weight (feels like you are hitting air).\nBut If you enjoy MMOs or mythology, you will probably enjoy this.  It does not take a lot of time to finish it (30 hrs, and I am one of thos egamers that explores every nook and cranny and goes back to previous areas to re-explore after important plot events).\n\nIt is a good in between game while you are waiting for something else to release.\n\nThe story was nothing spectacular, but definitely enough to keep me wanting to see more.

When you're bogged down in worthless quests grinding for animal skins so you can afford a purple bowtie instead of settling for a green one, at least you should have a few people to shoot the **** with. With Numen however you're all by your miserable lonesome.\n\nThere are zero compelling aspects to Numen. The story is pap, the combat is awful, there's no sense of exploration or even a shred of creative design. It's like a series of templates messily slapped together. How much did I pay for this game? Probably less than a dollar. Was it worth it?

For anyone that loves extreme grind without anyone to talk with/adventure with, this is probably a gem. But that just isn't me, so I can't in good conscience recommend it.\nPlay a f2p instead.

The game features a leveling system similar to the orginal Dugeon Siege where using a particular attack type, whether melee, magic or ranged will make your character gradually progress in that specialization.  The system is well implemented here and the result is a game that comes across as a nice hyrbid of the setting from Titan Quest and the gameplay mechanics of Dungeon Siege.  Both widescreen and Steam Overlay are supported, but unfortunately the Xbox 360 controller is not.
