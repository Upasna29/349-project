However the puzzles in this game aren't the hardest ever, but there's definitely a few in here that keep you interested and determined to get through the game.\n\nI do recommend this game if you're a fan of brain-teasers, just don't expect the storyline to make a lot of sense as so far i'm finding it difficult to piece together and follow. Will come back to this if it makes any sense at any point.\n\nUltimately for Â£3.99 you can't really ask for more..","December 19, 2015","true","0.4"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","16","17","3","0"
