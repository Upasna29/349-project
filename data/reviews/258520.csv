Rating: 8.5/10.\n\n+ Visually stunning. One of the most realistic environments I've seen so far.\n+ Great soundtrack that ties in quite well with the environment. Music gets gloomy when walking in dark parts of the wood, become more optimistic and light when entering a clearing, etc. The transitions are quite well done as well (i.e. it doesn't just jump from gloomy to cheerful).\n+ Interesting storyline and puzzles. The puzzle-difficulty is suitable for the average gamer. Game mechanics such as your psychic powers, were a nice touch as well.\n\n+/- Playthrough is about 6 hours (plus or minus one or two hours depending on whether you take the time to walk around and just enjoy the scenery). Relatively short, but it didn't feel too short.\n\nMy main problem with the [old version of the] game was the lack of a player-controlled saving option [EDIT: apparently, this issue is fixed in the Redux Version]. This made me feel rushed; trying to run through the story to reach the next save-point, rather than enticing you to explore and just enjoy the game.

You won't be running around guns blazing in this game, you have to look for hints or you'll be missing something for sure. You can complete everything or nothing in any order. You won't see any kind of log book, map or quest marker. I really liked it, but unfortunately the game is a bit too short to enjoy the investigative experience. Another great thing about the gameplay is that you will never experience any interruption because the game needs to load areas, you start from the beginning and reach the end in one single walk. This is probably the reason why this game is so short, a longer and a bigger game environment might have required a loading screen or two.\n\n***STORY 8/10: That's all this game is about, story. As you are told at the beginning of the game "This game is a narrative experience that does not hold your hand". Step by step you'll discover the truth about the mysterious events that happened in Red Creek Valley until you reach the end where the ultimate truth will be revealed. I can't tell anything without spoiling something, so I'll just say it's really enjoyable.\n\n***GRAPHICS 10/10: I have never, NEVER, seen such beautiful environment. I grew up near the Alps and I can see that exact scenery in this game; rocks, trees, bushes, and even the undergrowth look absolutely real. The textures are high quality photos of actual, real life environment. I suggest you read this to learn more about this spectacular creation. http://www.theastronauts.com/2014/03/visual-revolution-vanishing-ethan-carter/\n\n***SOUND 9/10: Beautiful music completes the game, it goes hand in hand with the environment.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/258520/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is an adventure game which was released on PC in mid 2014, and then later released on the PS4 in the summer of 2015.\n\nThis is an open world style environment where you have very little guidance on where to go or what to do. You are left to your own devices and to progress in the game. There are a number of puzzles which you must find yourself and pretty much solve with no aid at all. Some of the puzzles are pretty hard to even locate. All of the puzzles are solved by using paranormal abilities such as sensing where objects are in the world or assembling a time line of events of the past.  This was my favourite gameplay mechanic in The Vanishing of Ethan Cater, you essentially have to work out the order of events that led up to the murder of a character. This is done by seeing small memories throughout the world and then just ordering them by assigning them a number by walking up to the memory. This really makes you think about the events which have taken place, and some of them can be quite shocking!\n\nThe graphics in The Vanishing of Ethan Cater are absolutely gorgeous, easily one of the best looking games out there at the moment. The game runs in the Unreal engine 3, and the developers have really pushed it to it’s limits here. There is a wide array of graphical options in the menu, allowing you to customize it how you want. All of the graphical elements are perfectly designed. Sunsets, water reflections, foliage, all of it looks almost has a photographic realism to it.\n\nPlot wise, this game has a very interesting tale to tell; I have to admit, it took me at least 15 minutes or so for me to really understand what was happening but after that I was fully immersed and engaged in the story. You will see plenty of twists and turns right until the final credits.\n\nThe Vanishing of Ethan Cater is fully voice acted to an extremely high standard; all of the sound effects are really well made too, such as the sounds of the forest, lakeside noises and other ambient sounds that go unnoticed, unless you actually listen out for them.\n\nAs this game has some moments in it where you have no idea where to go or how to progress, I had to resort to the use of a walkthrough, many people who read my reviews will know that it is something I have to do on a regular basis for this genre of game. Saying that, even with the use of a walkthrough, there are still moments where you have to put a lot of thought into the puzzles. There is also only one  “enemy” in The Vanishing of Ethan Cater throughout the whole story, and I was a little disappointed that it wasn’t made to be a more challenging encounter than it was,  since you could easily navigate your way around it with ease.\n\nThe open world in which The Vanishing of Ethan Cater is set in, is giant, and you can find something interesting to look at everywhere you turn; there are tons of different letters, journals, books and signs to interact with to get even more depth from the story. You won’t really encounter any other characters in real time though, all of the other NPCs you find will be when you are using your paranormal abilities, so there isn’t any real character interaction going on.\n\nThis game took me just under three and a half hours to complete; I feel that to be a perfect length for any adventure game like this, as it allows for a plot to be formed, fleshed out and resolved in a timely manner.  Bear in mind, this was with a walkthrough for the majority of it; if you are going in blind, I would estimate you are looking at a five or six hour game.\n\nI started out playing The Vanishing of Ethan Cater on a 4K resolution, and whilst it was playable with the majority of the settings on full, I still had the odd frame rate drop when I was looking in a direction which had a lot to render, such as over the dam. When dropping the resolution down to 1080p, the frame drops stopped and I was able to continue playing at a smooth 60 FPS.  The game does have full controller compatibility, however I would recommend you use a keyboard and mouse for this game, just because it’s first person and a mouse makes controlling so much easier.\n\nIn conclusion, The Vanishing of Ethan Cater is a very nicely presented adventure game; whilst it doesn’t have any really fast paced action moments, it does have some intriguing puzzles and well throughout story behind it. You will also get to see one of the best looking games to date, and that is something which you should not miss out on.  I won’t go as far to say The Vanishing of Ethan Cater is a must play for a PC game, but I will highly recommend it, just because the game has very little, if any negative points, and everything else is done to an exceptionally high standard.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

I kept a guide handy because after glancing at it later in the game for the first time, I realized I had missed SO much in the beginning. So much so that I restarted a new game.\n\nThe story is beautiful, tragic, and extremely gripping.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/urnbont/recommended/258520/","urnbont","dangerhighdoltage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/urnbont/","1542 products in account","When I was about 9 years old I dug through my brother's locker while he was away at college.  It was an old brown wooden locker with large hotdog shaped handles and the lock had finally given way after years of pulling on it when no one was looking.  It popped open with a quiet squeak, and inside was a giant tangle of tennis rackets, socks, a few ribbons, a couple of  award plaques, old t-shirts, some stinky cologne shaped like a turn of the century automobile, and an old rusty tin.  The rusty tin caught my eye.  I secreted it away in my room and shut the locker.  The lid gave way with a bit of rust and inside were items that I still find fascinating to this day.  Old comic books.  Really old.  Older than he was, dating from the 30's, 40's, and 50's.  It must have been handed down to him from my grandpa or grand uncle, I never found out.  They were aged and nearly falling apart.  Inside them were stories of horror, alien attacks, secret people under the sea awaiting to attack, detective stories, ghost stories, and a distinctly remember a giant sea monster attacking a guy in an old diving suit that looked like something out of Bioshock.\nIt was with that type of fascination for discovery that I felt completely taken in by The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.\n\nYou are Paul Prospero, a detective looking for young Ethan Carter.  From the moment you step out of the tunnel, the graphics pull you in and narration starts.  It's not frivolous.  The dialogue has a will of it own and the mystery keeps you in the dark about what is really going on.  You start out finding clues and small side stories.  Each story takes you on a mini journey.  There are puzzles involved and clues to be sorted out in chronological order.  Generally, these fairly are straightforward and the hardest part really is figuring out how to get to the next clue sorting mini game.  Followed by those are cut scenes of your clues in order blending into the game quite well about a very devious evil that pressures Ethan's family.\n\nAmong all this are some of the best graphics I've seen in a game.  And I found myself taking more and more screenshots.  Stared at some trees for almost 5 minutes.  Left\nthe river running in game and just sat back to enjoy the environment with my eyes closed for the sound experience.  It's serene. The backdrop to all these dark missions, is the most relaxing background I've come upon.\n\nAnd the missions are a reasonable difficulty level.  Nothing is right in front of you, yet not hidden from sight.  I'd say it's just right.  Ok, well that crow did take me ages to find, but besides that I thought *pacing* was set very tightly to a good groove.\n\nGameplay is straightforward with clicking on certain items that glow with inviting text, but you *do* need to complete certain events in order to move forward.  If you get stuck, you might have overlooked something that has to be done first.   You won't need to combine many items or keep an inventory, it's elegantly simple in it's design.\n\nThe ending does come a little quick.  Yet, I had no feelings of "aww, that's it??!!".  If anything I felt like it came to a very satisfying end.  And I played the ending a few times just to see it again.  You'll get about 3-5 hrs out of it depending if you go quickly or search every nook and cranny like I did.  And sometimes I'd just let it run for the hell of it as background scenery.\n\nWhen I was done I found I was missing a few achievements.  Those are not easy to locate without a guide.  However, I do not advise looking at a guide until you have finished the game.  You will get so much more out of it that way.  This is a wonderful story, or rather set of stories.  Hidden away in a secret locker inside a tin.  Waiting for the lock to give way. 9/10.\n","August 23, 2015","true","12.4"," 121 of 135 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","121","135","6","10"

The detective scenes are well done and never become overly confusing, but they make up less than half of the gameplay. A majority of the gameplay involves walking around, (and probably getting lost), searching for the next scene. This isn’t a bad thing, though, as the ambiance and graphics are absolutely stellar; and the gameworld is a joy to explore. That said, if you aren’t really a fan of slow-paced games without action, colloquially dubbed: “walking-simulators,” then you may find this boring. But if you can appreciate its beauty and take solace in the fact it isn’t a pure walking-simulator and has a number of puzzle-solving scenes, you will probably enjoy  The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.\n\nWithout a doubt, the best feature of this game is the gorgeous gameworld and atmosphere. But it is more than just beautiful graphics that create this exceptional experience. The soundscape and overall ambiance are also leading contributors. Shortly after first beginning to play this game I found myself crossing a long railway bridge over a lake and I was immediately sucked in by the aesthetics. But I quickly realized that I was captivated by more than the visual view, and that the creaking and groaning effects of the bridge were reinforcing the immersive experience at an exceptional level. This aesthetic and atmospheric experience is established early and maintains its integrity throughout the game.\n\nThe actual narrative is interesting and mysterious. The onus is on the player to piece together the narrative and make sense of it. Depending on how much you bother to read and listen, the story becomes more clear or convoluted. I enjoyed the experience; however I do feel like some of the elements of the storyline could have been more fleshed out and explained more clearly.\n\nThe gameplay is comprised of mostly exploration, but also has a strong aspect of puzzle-solving elements. As you wander the gameworld you will come across several mysteries, in the form of both murder scenes and supernatural enigmas, which need to be solved through detective work. The mechanics of the puzzle-solving involve discovering the necessary clues in the gameworld and performing the necessary deductions.\n\nThere isn’t any action whatsoever throughout the whole game, save for one small area where you may get a jump-scare and sent back to a checkpoint. But even that area is extremely easy to navigate and never really amounts to much action. This is a good thing, as forcing combat or action into the game would have probably only ruined the atmosphere.\n\nOne gripe with the game that I have, and also many others have, is that there is no manual saving. I have said it a number of times in my reviews before and I will continue to say it: there is no reason for a PC game in the current generation and beyond to not allow manual saving. I don’t care what kind of game it is, I personally believe people should be able to choose if they want to use manual saves or not. And besides, in The Vanishing of Ethan Carter there is no combat and there are no decision trees, so “save-scumming” (as it is so eloquently called) isn’t even a factor here. Compounding the issue, the checkpoint system isn’t very well-crafted and the distance between checkpoints can be ridiculously far. You need to solve a puzzle or discover the next area in order to prompt the game to save, so if you are stuck and want to stop playing, you will either have to check a guide to finish your current objective or accept the fact you will have to start over when you return. And of course, there is also a possibility of a power outage or system crash. Fortunately, this issue was somewhat alleviated in the Redux version of the game by significantly increasing the frequency of checkpoints. Yet I still find the lack of manual saving to be a serious fault.\n\nAs for the Redux version, if your computer can handle it, you should probably play that version. You get both versions together with the purchase of the game. Besides having higher quality graphics from UE4, there are also some subtle changes and improvements (like the aforementioned increase in checkpoints). I personally opted to play the original version, because I’m weird like that, but I will probably come back and play the Redux version in a few years when the story has faded from my memory.\n\nThe Vanishing of Ethan Carter is definitely a very enjoyable experience, if not a peaceful one. You won’t find any action, but you can find mystery and intrigue. And the atmosphere and aesthetic beauty of the game are superb. It felt, to me, like some beautiful lovechild of Dear Esther and MURDERED: SOUL SUSPECT. If you like relaxing and investigative games, or are curious about them, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is absolutely a good one to consider.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","February 15","true","3.4"," 109 of 120 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","109","120","5","2"

The more I read, the more I wanted to try it out so finally I just said screw it and picked it up.\n\nGotta say, $20 well spent!\n\nSure, the game is only 4-5 hours long, depending on how much exploring and running around you do, but the whole package is so interesting that it feels much deeper than it really is.\n\nGRAPHICS: Everyone talks about how pretty this game is.  Well, it's no lie.  I found myself taking constant screenshots like I was on some sort of nature hike.  You know, those shots that everyone takes when they go on outdoor trips.  Trees, rocks, water, old buildings. All of it looks great in this game and I was a real shutterbug.  I just left the settings alone, but with my system it was at max by default.  Smooth animations too!\n\nSOUND: The voice overs, the music, the ambient sound effects.  All very authentic.  Similar to the above comments on graphics, the sound can realy draw you in.  Just put on some headphones, go stand by the water and just listen.  Wind, water flow, bugs, birds.  Nature.  It is very peacful.\n\nGAMEPLAY: This is another part of this game I really enjoyed.  The whole discovery mechanic for finding objects and solving puzzles is refreshing.  I could do without time stamping events, but thankfully those are few and far between.  If anything, I wish there were MORE puzzles.  This game makes me want a full blown "Sherlock Holmes" style mystery adventure with similar mechanics in place.  Would be awesome!\n\nSTORY: This will be my only knock on the game.  Don't get me wrong, the story is really good, but it became a little obvious too soon (for me at least) what was going on.  So a few times in the game I found myself rushing a bit.  So when I say it's a negative, I mean like when an actor in a movie does a bad accent.  It doesn't make the movie bad, it just is someting that bugs you if you pay too much attention.\n\nVALUE: I just wanted to touch on this one more time.  Some might say $20 for such a short game is too much.  And maybe you are right, but the overall package is really what is worth every penny.\n\nSo in the end, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who just wants a refreshingly new adventure in a beautiful world.  Just dive in, and enjoy!\n\nHope they make another like this soon :)","October 20, 2014","true","4.3"," 95 of 104 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","95","104","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/recommended/258520/","spiritreviews","Spirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/","732 products in account","Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!\n\nAs I stumble through the overgrowth outside of Red Creek Valley I suspect I'm not a welcome visitor. Within five minutes of getting off the train tracks I've stumbled upon a series of gruesome traps, and not the sort you'd leave for any wild game. Flails and springs and pits. No, these traps are for curious outsiders. And intuition tells me it's claimed more than a few of the less observant ones... intuition and the shattered bones that litter the forest floor. This little hamlet has a dark secret, one tied directly to the disappearance of one Ethan Carter. And I intend to uncover the truth.\n\nAfter a few (seemingly) close calls I stop in a clearing to appreciate the sheer beauty of this pristine place. The trees sway lazily; some have made the transition into their fall colors, and some remain stubbornly verdant. The grass has grown high and unruly, claiming patches of neglected road, working in tandem with a blanket of primeval ferns. Freight cars sit unused, decaying on the tracks. It's at that moment I realize I've encountered no people, no wildlife. And the world around me suddenly grows still, anxiously waiting for me to move, to stop dawdling, to leave. But I can't. I may not be able to see it, but I know something is watching me, this clumsy outsider. Something malevolent, old, and hungry.\n\n“The Vanishing of Ethan Carter” can best be described as a mystery horror exploration narrative. While it isn't overtly frightening, it has an overwhelming atmosphere. The community of Red Creek Valley is a lot like iconic Silent Hill - except with an older, more sinister vibe. The decrepit setting slowly being swallowed by nature, the eerie crime scenes, the soft music, and excellent, grumbly narration all marry together to form a very unsettling, hypnotic surrounding. This is a town where Lovecraft's ancient, twisted gods rule. You are most certainly unwelcome. And you will feel that from beginning to end.\n\nBut like any good paranormal detective you'll press onward in spite of traps, murder scenes, and inexplicable, disembodied narration. You're Paul Prospero (Shakespeare's “The Tempest” anyone?), and this is your last case (you're roughly two weeks from retirement!). And this kid Ethan, with his special gift... he's relying on you. To find him. To save him. And to find out what's happened to this place and its colorful denizens.\n\nAs you explore you'll find clues and piece together what happened at certain locations. You'll spot abnormalities, anomalies, and the like. Sometimes something will be missing and there's a mechanic in which the item, for instance a crank, will show up as scattered text. If you look in the right direction the text will come together and you'll be able to see where item is located using your occult powers. Finally, if there's a victim in the vicinity and you've gathered enough clues, you'll have the opportunity to piece together what happened by “communicating” with the dead and reliving their final moments. And when you gather evidence and set the chronology of actions in order, man does it feel rewarding. And there's enough variety to keep these paranormal encounters fresh. And while the game is linear you'll have the freedom to explore and solve puzzles in whatever order you like.\n\nThis is a slow, methodical, meticulous sort of game. The sort of game you should play by yourself with your favorite comfort drink and no distractions. Really immerse yourself. It's one of the best looking games I've ever played – near photo realistic. The story is riveting, bizarre, and unflinchingly violent. This is an exploration game done right, with gameplay that challenges you to be observant and thoughtful. It's short, sure, but every hour is worthwhile and it doesn't overstay its welcome. “Ethan Carter” is a love letter; to Lovecraft and all things weird, and to classic detective stories. This is easily one of the best indie titles released in 2014.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? You mustn't keep the old ones waiting too long. Sure, they have time. Time means nothing to them.

It can be beautiful and yet, at the same time, bitter. It really helps to set the tone.\n\n+ Story - it's not the game's strongest point and it ends in a bit of a cliché way, but it still manages to be very enjoyable and interesting.\n\n\nCONS:\n\nx Playtime - sadly this game is very short, you can finish it after around 4-6 hours. It might help extend it's duration if you just walk around in the woods, the scenery is beautiful and perfect to expand your screenshot library.\n\nx Low Replay Value - pratically nonexistent. No achievements, no side stories. After you finish it, it basically becomes the best walking simulator in your game library (which might be fine for some).\n\n\nPlaying "The Vanishing of Ethan Carter" was like going to a really good restaurant - you pay for the quality, not the quantity - because even though it's quite short, everything about it is close to being perfect. 9/10","October 24, 2014","true","5.8"," 81 of 87 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","81","87","0","2"

I am going to attempt to explain that vague underlining feeling that occurs from playing a game like this. I have not wanted to revisit this game as it left such an imprint on me at an emotional level. I have lately been forced to revisit it, however, as the world of Ethan Carter has somehow mingled with my dreams to form nightmares despite not having played the game since it first came out.\n\nEthan's world leaves a bitter emptiness and darkness that I soon found I wanted to escape. As I walked through this beautiful forested land I soon began to notice the deadly silence. Is there anyone here? When is the last time that I have felt so alone in a place? I began to seek out the comfort of human voices. I craved for Paul Prospero to say something, anything. I didn't want to play the game anymore. I wanted to forget about it.... but I had to find Ethan... I had to know what happened here. I had to know what happened to this world drowning in quiet desperation, to this place that feels lost, alone, and afraid. It felt like it was hanging on for dear life like a fading memory... It felt like I was not supposed to be there.....\n\nI think that the atmosphere itself is brilliantly crafted and I would recommend playing it simply to have the experience. Just be prepared...

The warm autumn colors, the softly billowing clouds, how and which trees and leaves are swaying, softly moving mists and light flares, and all the little details... all combined to make a pleasant environment just to walk around and enjoy the scenery.\n\nLuckily for us, it's not just a pretty walking simulator.\n\nSo as you're thrust into Ethan Carter's world, you hear a short narrative by your (detective) character for the first minute or two... then, nothing. You're left standing all alone in the middle of a beautiful forest and It's all up to you to find where the stories are and to tinker with the game and figure out the puzzle mechanics. I didn't know this at first, so I kept walking (passing some of the obscure puzzle pieces) looking for an area that would trigger the next narratives... if it hadn't been for the super nice environment to enjoy, I think I might have already thrown a tantrum for this ;) But in the end, it makes for a really nice and visually rewarding walk around the island.\n\nThe story parts and puzzles are littered all over the fairly small island for you to discover and most of them can be completed in any order you choose, except for the few final ones. This can be a good thing, as it gives you the feeling of freedom to roam and explore... but in my case it was a little bit confusing as I missed a key encounter (that hints on the backstory) until it was the very last one I did before the finale; and at that point I was a little disappointed at the story I wove myself in my head about Ethan.\n\nThe ending though, tied everything together nicely... and it was a really satifying ending that explained just about all the loose ends for me. I came to appreciate all the little tidbits and details that were peppered throughout the island and all the characters and happenings to reach this conclusion.\n\nSo, if you ask me... The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is not just a beautiful game, it's also a fine story.","September 29, 2014","true","6.9"," 75 of 92 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","75","92","0","1"

This is a story-driven mystery game where you control a private detective named Paul Prospero, exploring and discovering several clues by communicating with the dead and seeing visions that help him locate a missing boy and discover the mistery behind a dark force lurking in Red Creek Valley.\n\nGameplay\n\nIn terms of gameplay, its a game with very simple mechanics, yet they work perfectly in it with many enjoyable puzzles that will engage you into the game. There is not much more to discuss in this aspect since this is a story-driven game, but I can say that everything gameplay wise works in favor of the game, and its experience, which overall focus on exploring beautiful scenarios for clues that help you solve the mystery around Red Creek Valley, while having a great sense of freedom that differenciates this piece of art from other linear story-driven games.\nLongevity is pretty small since I completed the game in about 3 hours, but somewhat expected since this is a story-driven game. Yet you will certainly spend some more hours into the game just by wandering through the astonishing environments present in the game, as by taking several screenshots since this is one of the most beautiful environments in game history in my opinion. The only two downsides of this game are really the length and the few autosave locations present in the game (no manual save feature either).\n\nStory\n\nThis is an extremely important category in this game since, like I said before, it is a story-driven game. And boy, how good it was! This is an extremely powerful and interesting story making the game extremely captivating. The writing is very smart, it is amazing to see a game with such smart writing and dialogs. This game also uses complex themes in its story in a very interesting and sometimes unpredictable way. The pacing of the story is top-notch too as the mystery unravels slowly till you reach the end. I also enjoyed the ending very much, it was an amazing conclusion and I am sure most of you will love it to.\n\nGraphics\n\nMoving on, lets discuss the graphics. They are amazing! A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! This is one extremely gorgeous game. The environments are simply breathtaking. If you like taking screenshots, you will do it all the time in this game. Absolutely insane the level of detail and spectacularity present in the scenario. It is so good that it makes you wanna visit a place like the Red Creek Valley in the real life. With amazing views like it has, the exploration part of the game feels extremely good, instead of feeling like a chore like in some other games.\n\nSound\n\nSound-wise I do not have any complaints either. The soundtrack is a perfect fit, as the sound effects. Voice acting was very good too, did not seemed like it was an Indie game at all.\n\nPerformance\n\nPerformance was great in my medium specs rig (you can see it in my profile). I played it in my 1440x900 resolution with almost every graphical settings maxed out (you have plenty of them to tweak in the game laucher) at 60 fps, with very few drops to never less than 50 fps.\n\nSummary\nPros:\nSimple, yet effective gameplay and puzzle-solving\nBreathtaking graphics and environments\nSpectacular story with amazingly well-written dialogs\nExtremely captivating game due to its story and scenarios\nAmazing sense of freedom\nGreat production values for an Indie Game\nCons:\nPoor autosave system\nSmall length\nMy personal score: 8.5/10\n\nIf you like story-driven games this is a must-buy. If you are looking for a game with amazing graphics this is also a must-have game. An amazing tale that revolves around the supernatural with a powerful story and a beautiful world to wander around. The small longevity may make you doubt about the value of this game, but even from its base price this game is one to have in your steam library. Have fun wandering through Red Creek Valley.","July 16, 2015","true","4.4"," 57 of 68 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","57","68","2","12"

The scenery is so beautiful that it will make you want to take screenshots of every single tree that you encounter. And when you think you just caught in one screenshot the nicest view there is in the game, you realize that if you move a bit sideways there's a completely different angle that makes the scene even more beautiful than the previous one. I spent hours just walking around and looking at everything, discovering sceneries of amazing beauty and marveling myself at the astonishing graphic detail.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=469046211\n\nBut the game is much more than a walking simulator. The story unfolds as you explore the surroundings: it's the tragic story of a boy called Ethan that has gone missing. Playing the role of the detective Paul, you embark on this mysterious adventure of finding the boy. On the road you discover different clues and solve different murder cases associated to his disappearance, by using of your supernatural ability to sense things. The story has a way of keeping you interested until the end, with unexpected events along the way. The ending is not predictable, although not out of the ordinary either; but it's the kind of ending you least expect to have.\n\nI would also advise checking a guide after you complete the game because there are a couple of vey enjoyable Easter eggs that are a nice addition to the main story and it would be a pity to miss them.\n\nThe story is designed as a thriller, there are a few scenes that might cause a bit of discomfort to some people: blood on the ground, mutilated corpses, spooky dark areas and a couple of jump scares. But it's not at all a violent game and the horror-y scenes are very bearable even for an easily startled person as I am.\n\nThe music adds a lot to the whole ambience of the game. It is dark in the sinister areas and cheerful in the lighted areas. The sound of the wind, of the river flowing, of the creaking floor when you step on it - all these immerse you even deeper in the whole atmosphere of the game.\n\nThe price of this game has been a bit too spicy for me (18,99€) if you consider it's shortness (4-5 hours for a complete playthrough) and I avoided buying it for a long time, but now after I played it, I understand that the price might justify the effort the developers put into creating this superb game. I definitely recommend buying it while on sale, at 75% off.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","June 28, 2015","true","6.4"," 43 of 50 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","43","50","4","4"

It isn't at all what I feared it would be after Chmielarz's call to "kill gameplay."  It's not a glorified cutscene.  It's not just a trek from point A to point B.  It's a good old first person adventure game, crafted with narrative impact and freedom of discovery in mind, with incredible presentation, an incredible atmosphere, and some of the most fluid, accessible puzzle design I've ever seen in a game of its type.  It teeters a little when it comes to its story and knowing exactly how much it needs to show to get its point across, it's got some technical irritations, and it might not be worth $20 to everyone.

Who are you, you might ask - let's say that doesn't matter. You are there to investigate what happened with Ethan and his family that got possessed by evil.\n\nWhat distinguish this game from other walking simulators, is definitely the graphics, sounds and music. It's made so delicately that you'll enjoy every second walking in the Red Creek Valley. And if you are more impatient or just want to quickly return somewhere, don't worry, developers allowed you to sprint (this is not Dear Esther). The nature around you feels like modded Skyrim that even on newest desktop builds run on low FPS, but Unreal Engine 4 makes a difference and this game, since the Redux edition that you get for free, runs great!\n\nThe gameplay itself is casual, most of the time you'll be exploring the valley, with interludes of dark memories of Carter family, and interludes where Ethan's short stories become real. Those stories are really nice and there's the one that stands out from the others - I won't spoil much, I'll just say that the Lovecraftian horror fans will get excited.\n\nWhat's worse is the length of the game, the game offers about 3 hours of entertainment with getting all achievements, and not much replayability. That fact is compensated with the beautiful environment and precious soundtrack. In the end it's all about your priorities, if you prefer the environment and story, or the length.\n\nI understand if you don't want to pay 19 euros for a short walking simulator but trust me - if you will see it on sale, buy it. It's a great experience.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","February 1","true","3.6"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","28","31","0","0"

That being said, the human models are not the most impressive things to look at, and the voice acting isn't the greatest, but none of it detracts from the experience of this beautiful game.    Gameplay  9  There is no hand holding in this mystery game, and once you start, it is all up to you to piece the puzzle together. With some wonderfully unique gameplay elements, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter succeeds in delivering both an enjoyable experience, and an immersive one.    Story  8  A compelling story that keeps you playing and thinking until you're done. Even once you have completed the game, you'll think back, pondering several possibilites. However, for how engrossed I was in solving the mystery of Ethan Carter, it was jarring how short the game was. Easily beaten in one sitting of a few hours. They could have taken this one a long way. But perhaps that's the beauty of Ethan Carter's story. It isn't dragged out, it just is what it is.    Multiplayer  N/A  None here, the best you'll do is solving the mystery with a friend sitting at your side.    Replayability  N/A  Only worth going back to if you missed something, or for the beauty of the envrionment. Other than that, there isn't much of anything to replay this game for. I'm giving this one a N/A simply because I do not feel replayability should be a factor in mystery games such as this. Once you know the story, you know it. These types of games are not designed to be replayed, so keep that in mind.    Overall  8.1/10  First, I was stunned by the envrionment and sounds. Next, I was thrilled by the gameplay elements. Finally, I was enthralled by the story.  Though I don't know I would recommend Ethan Carter for full price (simply because of the shortness of the game), absolutely pick it up on sale if you enjoy a good mystery.\nIf you liked this review, feel free to check out my curator page:\nThe Tipster\n\nYou are also welcome to join our group and play/discuss games together, here:  The Tipster","December 30, 2014","true","4.8"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","31","37","3","0"

The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is about a detective, Paul Prospero with supernatural powers who received a letter from Ethan Carter who claims to be in danger. He came to Red Creek Valley to find out what happened to Ethan.\n\nIn the game you control the detective in first person mode. The very first thing I noticed is that the game is absolutely gorgeous even on medium settings. On high, it look on par with Skyrim in my opinion. The game run quite well on my GTX 760, though there are some occasional stuttering, which still appear even when I drop down to medium. Though it is not truly noticeable.\n\nThe game does not hold your hand at all whatsoever. You are free to explore the Valley, which is a lot bigger than I originally thought. There are puzzles and items here and there that give you some backstory. The first big puzzle you encounter involved a train. (You'll know what I'm talking about if you play it) This is when your paranormal powers come into play. You can investigate the scenes and put clues together. Once all the clues come together. Paul special ability come into play, where you can put the entire sequence back in chronological order and experience what truly happened at the site. It's quite a fun and challenging experience. The next puzzle I encountered was with a house that warped, and you have to put the rooms in their correct place to solve it. (Which I am stuck on at the moment). As I said I'm only in Chapter 1, I think. So I'm sure there are many other gameplay mechanic I have not seen yet.\n\nThe voice acting so far is very well done. Paul sounds like your grizzly veteran detective who have seen it all. He sounds unnaturally calm with all the weird stuff going on around him. Which really add to the mysteriousness of his personality and his past. The soundtrack is also very well done. Though there are very, very few jump scares. The soundtrack provide a sense of uneasiness that really keep me on my toes. I constantly look behind my back, thinking there was something behind me. But other times, the soundtrack get incredibly mellow, and when you look at the beautiful world that The Astronauts studio have created. I was amazed at how well the music and the scenery mixed with one another.\n\nIf you are have play Murdered Soul Suspect before and somewhat enjoyed it at least. I think you would really enjoy The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. As I said, the game doesn't hold your hand at all. You are left to be your own detective and figure out the gameplay mechanic for yourself. It's quite enjoyable.\n\nThe best thing about the game so far it's the environment. Incredibly mysterious and calm at the same time. I'm terrified while playing this because I literally have no idea what to expect next yet I'm intrigued because I really want to find out what's going on.\n\nRight now on Steam reviews. There are 72 positive reviews and only 1 negative. You can see why I'm really enjoying this. I highly recommend this based on what I've experienced so far.","September 26, 2014","true","1.4"," 56 of 80 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","56","80","0","4"

Without even delving into the games synopsis the title evokes just the right amount of mystery and just like a chilling good book or thrilling film, Ethan Carter's opening segments really draw you into its superbly detailed and beautifully realized world. Red Creek Valley is town that is in the process of loosing the battle with nature itself. Located somewhere along America's Rust Belt, decay and degradation are everywhere as nature wages a war to claim back what rightfully belongs to her. There is also a distinct gothic-horror vibe the actual town evokes the first time you lay your eyes upon it. In fact the very first run-down shamble of a house you see from across the bridge that leads to the towns centre is pitched so perfectly high atop a grassy hill that it evokes the Bates Motel from Psycho.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=321277199\nNot since delving into Skyrim for the very first time has a game evoked such a sense of wonder and place. Red Creek Valley, in all its digital glory, feels so alive even when juxtaposed against the silence and solitude of its ghost-like town, a town the world has long forgotten about. To walk through its forests, climbs its hills, listen to the chirp of its birds is to be transported immediately into a world that is uncannily lifelike that at times one can barely believe it's simply made up from a series of horizontal and vertical pixels. Grass and flowers sway convincingly, trees shake then calm down then shake again as they dance with the wind. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is an astonishingly beautiful game to look at. As I explored Red Creek Valleys surrounding areas I could not stop thinking what an awesome experience this would be with an Occulus Rift attached to my head (in fact I can very well see these very forests and hills becoming my walking digital playground when I finally get my hands on the device so soothing and relaxing are they to witness, explore and experience).\n\nThe towns silence is also almost deafening, even though audibly the player is constantly surrounded by the ghostly sounds of the leaves in the trees swaying on the wind or that very wind whipping up around funneled corners to the popping sound of the gravel underneath the feet of Paul Prospero, the detective summoned to this town to find a missing young boy. Paul Prospero is no ordinary detective though. Blessed with supernatural abilities, Prospero is able to take information (that comes in the form of objects, letters, newspaper clippings and even dead bodies) and look into their past for further information or evidence and this is what makes up the bulk of gameplay in Ethan Carter as you try to make sense of what the past is telling you. Not everything is as simple as it looks though.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=321247855\nThe past's clues are often just as muddled as the run down town's remaining foundations. It's left up to the player to make sense of what they are seeing and what they are being told in order to advance the storyline. At its heart, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is point and click adventure. You will be required to solve puzzles and uncover clues and then uncover more clues in order to progress. Ethan Carters puzzles are not particularly challenging and most veteran puzzle enthusiasts should see the solution to all of them immediately which was a bit of a disappointment. The game is also incredibly short and can be blazed through in just over 3 hrs but to do so would be doing the digital world that The Astronauts have so painstakingly and lovingly crafted a disservice.\n\nWhere Ethan Carter does take some missteps is with its storytelling. To be honest - it's not particularly compelling or believable and it wraps up with an incredibly disappointing twist that made me feel like I should not have bothered with solving the mystery of the missing young boy in the first place but instead just continued roaming Red Creek Valleys forests and hills. While the script tries to go for poetic it often feels forced and the line delivery by all actors is often stilted and not particularly believable which kept pulling me out of the mystery and had me imagining a giant piece of cheese instead! I really was expecting the game to have more of an emotional punch and this seemed to be missing throughout the entire game from a narrative standpoint.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=321277302\nThe Vanishing of Ethan Carter is still an experience and one well worth grabbing, if just for its sublime digital world alone. The Astronauts must be commended for crafting a beautiful and often creepy adventure even when the sum of its parts don't always add up. From such a strong beginning that resonates with emotional clout and complete awe unfortunately slowly withers and fades away like the unreliable memories of its protagonists the further along you progress. For a game that delcares itself as a narrative piece with no hand-holding right at the start of the game, it's a pitty they didn't put as much effort and care into the narrative part in the same way they lovingly crafted Red Creek Valley.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","October 3, 2014","true","7.6"," 62 of 91 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","62","91","0","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cheesecake_Recipe/recommended/258520/","Cheesecake_Recipe","A Victim of Stars","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cheesecake_Recipe/","882 products in account","Paul Prospero, a detective with a unique skillset, is called towards a piece of fan mail as though the sirens themselves would emerge the moment he sliced the licked adhesive apart. A boy named Ethan Carter writes to him, detailing some dark happenings in the hidden countryside town he resides in. Paul realizes that Ethan wouldn't have chosen him if these dark things wouldn't require his particular abilities. His last case shall be this one, Paul decides, and sets out to the breezy hillsides of Red Creek Valley. Within minutes of arriving, he comes across a series of potentially deadly traps in the woods just on the outskirts of town. This case will be anything but ordinary for most people, but Paul Prospero is used to it.\n\nThe Vanishing of Ethan Carter takes some elements out of Murdered: Soul Suspect’s playbook and gives the player the ability to piece together crime scenes through supernatural ability. Whenever an important element is visible, you can interact with it to see Paul’s thoughts on how it may all fit in with the current scene. Sometimes he’ll even be able to locate a missing object by peeking through a ‘magic mirror’-like thought process. By arranging the scene to be exactly as it was at the moment of death, Paul can see the entire final minutes of the dead through a series of flashbacks. All of this is taught to the player by letting them discover each of the functions on their own. With no tutorial some players may find themselves a bit lost at first, but once you've gotten the first case down you've pretty much gotten the hang of all the skills you’ll need to progress.\n\nThrough scraps of Ethan’s writing laying around, we learn that he’s a pretty creative kid. If you’d ever asked him, he’d probably tell you his inspirations were Poe, Chandler, Lovecraft, and Verne. With this talent comes the evidence of a disturbed mind and a town with a secret underground some people are all too eager to get to. Some of his writing fits in with the events in town that you learn about through the paranormal mystery puzzles and newspaper clippings sitting around. There was an ever-present sensation in the pit of my stomach that something was up and it probably didn't want me here.\n\nThere was a lot of time to ponder the events of each case and how they related to the big picture, thanks to the sheer size of Red Creek Valley’s map. While not a fully open world, you can get to most places through a handful of paths and practicing a little mental triangulation as you work your way around. Nooks and crannies leading to quiet spots in the shade of the forest or some tossed away rotted wood planks that once upheld something or other are all over the place. I had the option to run everywhere, but I found myself utterly entranced by the almost photorealistic, if slightly dreamy, visual work done by The Astronauts. Every few steps was another gorgeous vista overlooking a lake. Every rock looked sharp enough to scrape my skin on. It’s hard to believe that this was all done in Unreal Engine 3. If you've ever looked at a single screenshot of the game, the visual fidelity remains that consistent for every backdrop.\n\nSeveral times I sat down under a tree for a few moments, watching as the knee-high grass whipped around in the wind. I closed my eyes and took in the soundstage. So perfectly crafted, small sonic details most games don’t have the time, money, or the will to reproduce so crisply. Had I not been watching the vivid countryside dancing before me just seconds before, I would have sworn I was listening to a Chris Watson sound collage. Positional audio is one thing that developers rarely get right, but it is one of the most essential elements in establishing a truly enveloping sense of place. When a crow cawed above my head, the sound moved realistically as I turned to face the source. Bug screeches, bending branches, rattling metal constructs, all represented with care. Headphones are an absolute must.\n\nIt isn't all purely idyllic, only a handful of shortcomings stain the pages of Ethan’s story. The first issue comes from the voice acting, which is about as stale as moldy bread. Paul himself performs the gravely-voiced detective role just fine and Ethan sounds much like a kid his age would, but any of the other supporting characters sound very off. The character models are another problem, their design and models not matching up to the picturesque backgrounds. They are stiffly animated, weirdly textured, and lack a lot of depth which would help them blend in more with the backgrounds. I won’t say it’s something like the toons sitting in a bar with Bob Hoskins in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but it is very noticeable. Some may find the game length too short, but I personally did not find this to be a big deal.\n\nAt a short 3 to 5 hours, Ethan’s adventure is over relatively shortly. But the game is always presenting you with something beautiful to look at, something suspicious to chew on, or some puzzle to solve. It even changes up the mechanics here and there to help keep things feeling fresh, avoiding too much repetition in the more game-y mechanics. This is a game which can be enjoyed by those who want a little meat on the bones they find leaning against a tree in the forest, reminding me a lot more of Ether One (a game you must check out if you enjoy Ethan Carter, by the way) than Dear Esther. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is meant to be taken slowly, absorbed like a good book dripping with detail. The ending may not exactly be the most surprising and some may find themselves a little disappointed. But the journey towards it is full of heart and imagination. Much in the way that Ethan Carter himself is.\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

Memorable, atmospheric, and hauntingly immersive at every turn of the game. Many will call this a straight-forward "walking simulator" and for the most part it is just that. Throughout the game you play as a detective named Paul Prospero who investigates into the disappearance of a young boy named Ethan Carter. Without spoiling a single thing, you pick up pieces of what may have happened to him by solving murders throughout the valley of Red Creek. In order to solve these murders you must figure out in which order the individual murders took place by identifying clues and placing them in the correct order. It may sound simplistic but you must use logic and careful inspection of the area in order to successfully figure out what happened for each murder. Other than the murders to investigate, the game boasts one of the most photo-realistic graphics I have ever seen. Just strolling through the area is breath-taking and convinces you that you are in a real place. The draw of the game in general is the story and its ending, which not only sums up the game neatly but also makes your head spin. This game sets a very high standard for any so called "walking simulator" because it is able to completely immerse you throughout its length. In conclusion, I highly recommend you buy this game, if not only just to screenshot a part of the game’s landscape.","May 14","true","5.1"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","4"

The way the player travels gives time to enjoy the scenery, obviously lovingly crafted by a team who knew their intention and how to reach it.\n\nBut, Ethan Carter has a major flaw.\n\nWithout spoiling, I will say there are three distinct points that ruined the game for me. Two of them completely deimmerse you from the game, shaking you awake from a dream by simply slamming confusion into your face, where you wake up and immediatly realize, "This doesn't fit" forcing you to shake your head, only to try to get yourself back into the story. As well, the ending of the game (Again, without spoiling) completely erradicates the immersion and interest in the story by simply telling you "Nothing you experienced mattered" making any analysis of lines of dialogue, narrative, and story telling null and void.\n\nThe game itself was a nice, narrative experience, but it leaves a bitter taste in ones mouth simply with a drop of the plate, taking what could have been a finely crafted piece of art into a shabble as the explanation to the events clears all of the paint from the canvas.\n\nThe game left me unsatisfied, and not that I was wanting more, it was that I felt that the thought and time I invested into the story was simply thrown away when the developers took the easy route out plot wise.\n\nI sadly cannot recommend this game, watch a Let's Play if you're curious, but the dissatisfaction with how the story holds together in the end isn't enough to warrant even 20 dollars.","October 7, 2014","false","2.9"," 30 of 42 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","30","42","0","3"

This is first and foremost about the senses.  The visuals are top notch using Photogrammety (http://www.theastronauts.com/2014/03/visual-revolution-vanishing-ethan-carter/) as the catalyst for near realistic perfection.  In a sense there is no reused tiled textures, just real world goodness to trick your eyes into believing this is a random and breathing world.\n\nIf Ethan Carter suffers from anything negative it's the ending.  Lovecraft buffs will find a bit of disappointment when the climax is reached.  Although the game is very much an art project, the story did not have to follow suit.  But Some may find the ending satisfying.\n\nThere is no mistaking the obvious: Ethan Carter is a labor of love that deserves every bit of attention it should recieve.  Do not let this experience pass you by.  If your PC can handle the process crunching this game dishes out (and amazingly can do quite a bit without being too extremely taxing on your videocard) then take the walk through this quiet yet haunting tale.

If you prefer action-horror titles with strong thrill factors and quick plot pacing, this game may feel a little empty and...well...like a hiking simulator (albeit an absolutely stunningly detailed one.)\n\nThere is no HUD in this game, no map, no compass and notably, no visual indication of the passage of in-game time (the sun is fixed about 15 degrees above the horizon, creating gorgeous sunset shadows that really highlight the team's mastery of Unreal Engine's lighting effects.)\n\nGameplay consists of wandering through lush forrests and crumbling turn-of-the-20th-century industrial architecture looking for small mystery scenes, usually indicated by bobbing white text over any object that can be interacted with.  The scenes weave a narrative that can be loosely linear, although finding a piece of the story's thread non-linearly in no way spoils the effect.  If you've played Dear Esther, you'll find a more cohesive plotline but a very similar feeling narrative structure.\n\nIf you're looking to quickly advance the story, this game leaves very much wanting - the mini mystery puzzles are few and far between, expect to spend approximately 10% of this game actually involved in gameplay and the rest of the time exploring and seeking out the next scene.\n\nExploration in this game is a reward in and of itself, but not in the sense that you'll find a unique item or clever easter egg.  Rather, the highlights of exploration will be to find particularly stunning view points where the sun quite literally bursts forth through the clouds and illuminates a vast and breathtaking vista in the valleys below, or marvelling at the craftsmanship and detail that went into the making of this world (I particualarly enjoyed the crests placed on the family tombstones in the graveyard - attention was paid to even minute details.)\n\nLearning one thing early in gameplay will save you quite a bit of time and frustration - the mini crime scenes are generally confined to an area no larger than a few hundred square yards, so if you find yourself going on quite a hike looking for a missing piece of the puzzle you should go back and re-examine the scene.\n\nTL;DR - Buy this game if you want a gorgeous (the visuals alone immersed me immediately) and thoughtful mystery horror adventure (think LA Noir crossed with Dear Esther in a more Lovecraftian world) with a strong emphasis on narrative and environment.  If you prefer more action oriented games like Silent Hill or Slenderman this may be slower and emptier than you seek.  If you ever question whether a game can also be art, buy this immediately.","September 25, 2014","true","5.1"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","22","30","0","0"

'First-person story driven mystery game' is not completely inaccurate, but it is slightly misleading. This is much less a game and more an 'arthouse experience with walking simulator'.\n\nThe plot is certainly intruiging; you arrive in Red Creek Valley, as a paranormal detective named Paul Prospero. Having received letters from a young boy called Ethan Carter, his vanishing prompts your arrival and intent to discover what happened here. Slowly, piece-by-piece you start to dissect the confusion and put together the truth...\n\nOk, so the plot doesn't sound THAT exciting when I look back at it, and I'd have to say that's my first big problem with Ethan Carter - this game does not grip you. I felt a real sense of disconnection from the game, and never really felt immersed in it from the word go. There is a real absence of tension, excitement and thrills from a game that implies it's full of the stuff.\n\nVisually, on the other hand, it's stunning. It's easily the best-looking indie game ever made, with graphics akin to Alan Wake on a commercial level. It has that 'coastal small American town' feel to it and it certainly looks the part - the lush vegetation and general scenery are epic.\n\nBack to the more negative aspect though is the length - this game took me 5 hours - and a lot of that was via walking around rather aimlessly thanks to a couple of bugs which cost me at least two hours of gameplay. For £15 you really expect more than just 3-5 hours gameplay, no matter how some people try to justify the 'experience' and it being 'high-brow arthouse that's to be savoured'. My wallet is to be savoured too, and 5 hours doesn't cut it.\n\nThen we have the abominable save system. There ARE some locations which have hard saves written in - aka you can go to them and they save your location, but otherwise you only get a save for achieving something in the game. AKA you can stroll around for ages, not actually go to a hard save location and not achieve anything, and guess what? None of what you did saved! And then there's the fact the saves only 'save scene'. So, for example, if you partially complete one bit, want a break...well...you can't. Because until you finish that scene your progress in that scene does not save, and if you move on without saving and DO save at a hard save location? Everything you did in that earlier scene is erased and you have to start again. In short, the save system is a mess.\n\nThere's also that inescapable feeling that you're just walking around looking at things - nice looking things, yes, but the game's non-linear nature means you can do what you like in what order you want, and it makes it feel disjointed.\n\nThere ARE great sequences here, and I won't spoil any of them. One of them actually intimidated me and made me say 'what the h*ll...' which I liked. I like something unexpected and different, and a few scenes achieved this.\n\nBut overall I paid £15 for a first-person adventure and feel like I got a very nice looking 5 hour walking simulator more akin to Dear Esther than anything else.\n\nI recommend this if you like that kind of game, but please, know it's what you're getting and not a more energetic, high-octane thriller like I was hoping for. Due to the misleading synopsis I have to regrettably not recommend it, but if they change the synopsis to a more accurate and honest content appraisal, I will reverse that.\n\nPity it doesn't reverse my £15.","October 4, 2014","false","6.1"," 43 of 68 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","43","68","0","0"

It’s a noble failure. Best graphics I have ever seen. They perfected a new technique that translates photographs of environments into game art. They call it revolutionary and I can’t argue.\n\nThe problem is not with the story. It’s well written and solidly delivered, with reasonable voice acting.\n\nThe flaw is the game itself. At the start they state that the game doesn’t hold your hand, which is just a disclaimer for bad game design. They wanted to have an open-world, but they failed to explain what to do. You will almost certainly have to backtrack to the start of the game once you realise the right approach. Small spoiler: at the start of the game there are several man traps if you go off the path. Do not do the natural, intuitive thing and stay on the path. Find every man trap, even though the game doesn’t give you any explanation why you would want to. It’s typical of the opaque game design and it’s not the worst example. I had to resort to a walkthrough to finish, in other words the game failed me.\n\nIt seems a game with a linear story requires a linear structure to frame it. I’d rather play Dear Esther, even though it’s not quite as pretty and the story is far less sophisticated.\n\nHaving said that, if you can get the game cheaply, it is still worth buying simply to experience the environment.

"Dear Esther" of Unreal 3 engine. Even though it's not next-gen (game utilizes DX9c), it already looks far superior and photorealistic thanks to photogrammetry technique, that've been used to make game assets and levels;\nMisterious, nostalgic and captative atmosphere, that reminds of Twin Peaks, Alan Wake and that favorite suspense fiction of yours;\nVery well made and visualized puzzle and solving mechanics, that look refreshing and keep you interested;\nWeird fiction horror story. Even though nothing truly original, but interesting, logical and very well told;\nRather cheap for the ammount of work put onto this project;\nCons:\nShort experience. All investigations, puzzles and plots will take you around 4-5 hours. Took me more then 7 hours, because I've enjoyed vistas and explored the levels more, then I should;\nNot really open-world. In fact it's like one of those vastly huge levels of first Crysis. It's understandable, and even surprising for Unreal 3 engine though - there are no loadings between locations, few FPS drops can occur here and there as assets are loading into your RAM/VRAM;\nI wish puzzle mechanics could be exploited more, it's too few of them for such a great idea. Scarcity of puzzles due to owerall shortness of the game and story (but not the map, lol, it's huge);\nNo replayability, no loading to specific scene, no freeroam to enjoy the vistas after game completion;\nFew minor bugs here and there at the game's launch.

You play as Paul Prospero, a sort of psychic detective hired by what is presumably a dead Ethan Carter to investigate his disappearance and a number of murders in a small mountain/lake/mining town.\n\nThe dynamic for revealing the pattern of each murder and finding certain clues was really cool. Basically, each piece of evidence allows you to peek a little bit more into the past until you finally unlock sequences of memories that, after putting them in the proper order, reveal what happened for each murder/disappearance. However, that is still just a small part of what this game is about. As you find pieces of stories Ethan wrote, you often unlock other sequences that end in reveals that further send you along your path of investigation.\n\nAttention to detail is important with this game. There are subtle cues that let you know sort of where to look or what you might have missed. These largely take the part of weird flashes in the distance. You can also easily find yourself wandering around wondering what to do next, but overall, once I grew familiar with the game and started to take note of the cues, my experience was far more straightforward. Of course, by that time, I had spent plenty of time enjoying the amazing graphics this game boasts. The game is truly beautiful, and attention was spent giving everything the little details that really breathed life into this game. From little nests to birdstains and moss on rocks, weather worn surfaces, and so on, this game really nailed it on a visual level. In this regard, it boasts similarities to Dear Esther, for example, but in a far superior fashion.\n\nThe music was also excellent, and ofttimes completely creepy. You start wondering when some crazy creature is going to jump out at you or some beast is going to start gnawing on your body, lol. Really, really atmospheric music that adds to the mystery and sometimes tension of the game.\n\nAs far as the story itself, it was also really well thought out. At the end, you kind of have to chuckle a little bit even as you feel completely saddened by the revealed source of everything that was happening in the game. The whole time, it keeps you guessing a bit, and then once the final reveal happens, you start having personal revelations akin to having watched the Sixth Sense for the first time (in that all the seemingly disparate events all tie together at the end and seem obvious in retrospect).\n\nI found this to be a thoroughly enjoyable experience and one I can easily recommend to anybody who loves games (and especially exploration/mystery type experiences).\n\nI give this ten "solved murders and creepy piano runs that sort of make you jump" out of ten.","April 29, 2015","true","4.9"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/littlequillybunny/recommended/258520/","littlequillybunny","♫Quilly Shiba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/littlequillybunny/","4312 products in account","There are more and more games that are tagged “walking simulator” nowadays. Sometimes they are pretty, sometimes they aren’t. Sometimes they have great game mechanics apart from just being virtual tourism, sometimes they don’t. Story-wise, they could be good or bad. I have to say, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter has all of these.\n\nUpon starting the game it felt like I was really walking in a forest on abandoned train tracks. Many games I have played are “pretty”, but usually you’ll notice something out of place, some texture that doesn’t fit into place, something unpolished. Ethan doesn’t have this problem, the scenery is all very realistic and quite gorgeous - it’s quite clear the devs took great care on the quality. If you’re getting this game because you heard it’s very aesthetically pleasing, that’s one criteria down.\n\nPerformance wise, I had some micro-stutters (which seems to be a somewhat common issue and is addressed in the main FAQ on the forums). But I’m running it maxed out, and it doesn’t happen often, capping it at 60 fps for me seemed to fix the issue, but I’m not completely sure if that was the only thing. Otherwise, the game has proved to run very smoothly.\n\nThe story is really immersive - it’s not quite linear and you’re allowed to to play most parts in whatever order you choose. To get to the endgame, the game makes sure you have to have come across all necessary pieces of information to do so, but before that, it’s pretty open world. It also tells you what you’ve missed, before the end, so you can go back and gather the missing information without wasting time, something I really appreciated in the design.\n\nNow the gameplay -you are actually here to solve mysteries, and you have to carefully explore and observe to do so. I’m very impressed with the way the game lets the player do so - it seems very natural, a good contrast to some very forced mystery games (where you “randomly combine everything in the inventory to try to advance the story”).\n\nI do have some gripes with the game - there are some very helpful things with the controls I could have benefitted from knowing, but at the same time, a tutorial doesn’t seem to fit too well in the atmosphere the game is trying to create. So I suggest new players browse or ask for some beginner tips (not too much in case of spoilers), it did cause me frustration because I didn’t know of some mechanics at all till I had to read a guide. Overall, this frustration lasted for a while in the middle of the game but after getting past that, the game delivered so well all was forgiven!\n\nTo be honest one of my favorite “walking simulators” has been Gone Home, or something similar - great visuals and storytelling, some puzzle solving elements. Ethan added on my expectations with greater scope and deeper gameplay elements, which makes it quite a full fleshed adventure/ mystery game in my books rather than just a “walking simulator”, now. So unless you’re expecting a guns blazing, action packed game, Ethan should meet your expectations in many good ways.","December 25, 2014","true","5.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","1"

From time to time, you will come across opportunities to explore optional vignettes reminiscent of classic sci-fi and horror storytelling.  These each offer a different and unique type of gameplay (within the basic context of walking around and interacting with things) and are more charming and evocative experiences than the mandatory crime scene reconstructions that make up the main plotline.\n\nNone of that is terribly important, though.  You don't buy this game for the opportunity to determine the order of events in four or five murders; you buy it to explore its setting.  As you do, you're sure to notice that The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is unbelievably beautiful.  Sheer graphical prowess is not typically important when evaluating the worth of a game, but in this case every wind-blown leaf and scattered light shaft contributes to the sense of place.  If we see a game that looks better than this within the next five years it'll be a miracle—or perhaps a follow-up from developer The Astronauts.\n\nThe layout of the environment is exceptionally artful and, to players of a certain disposition, lends itself to another level of appreciation for the game.  When I first began playing, I must have spent twenty minutes simply admiring the paths that crisscross through the small opening area.  While the points of interest for gameplay purposes within Red Creek Valley are less than a dozen in number, they are placed in such a circular fashion that each has two different routes leading to it.  This enhances the believability of the locale while, again, being impressive and pleasurable in its own right for those inclined to enjoy the relationships between places.\n\nMusic and ambient sound are as lovely and work as hard as the visuals in bringing this place to life.  As I played, now and then I realized that I was feeling a reverence for my surroundings that I find to be rare but nonetheless is one of my primary motivations for playing games.  The Vanishing of Ethan Carter gave me a sense of Being There that reminded me of other favorite experiences like Fract OSC and Ico.  Some might find the game part of the game to be thin or overly brief; I would argue that it's fine for what it is, which is an excuse just to be in this magical world.","September 27, 2014","true","7.4"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","21","32","0","0"

Recommended as "art", but it's an interactive story, not a game\n\nI've got to admire the makers for giving us a distinct and beautiful open world game with a melancholic and eerie atmosphere throughout. It's like wandering around a weird abandoned wilderness that lies somewhere between a Stephen King novel and Myst. The graphics and music can't be faulted.\n\nHowever, as much as it has shown great potential in the likes of Flower and Shadow of Colossus, this to me is a sign that this indie trend of "games = art" is getting a little tired, at the expense of producing a game that actually has gameplay. So you get a fanbase easy to please by a world with a nice setting atmosphere and graphics regardless of what the story and gameplay are like.\n\nI had my eyes on this since it was released, and really wanted to like it, as I heard "Lovecraftian point and click adventure" and thought "well there still aren't enough of those". saw the trailer and screenshots and was convinced.\n\nUnfortunately though this barely functions as a point and click game. Sure the reviews clearly say already this is "short and sweet", some estimating the game length at 4 or 5 hours. Mine has been logged at around 6 I think, but I spent so much time backtracking I could have done it in half the time. More on this issue I had later. Reviews online have also referred to its "restrained story". No kidding, there barely is one, and I found the ending disappointingly anticlimactic in terms of gameplay and cryptic and somewhat cliched in terms of the story resolution, also the "Lovecraftian" setting was hugely overstated. It works more as a Stephen King psychological horror than anything else. .\n\nRegarding the point and click functions, I found every puzzle laughably easy once you work out the logic behind the game, which takes a while, because perhaps not unusual for a point and click, it does basically throw you into an open-world wilderness at the start and leave you to figure out how the basics of the game work as you go along. So as stated I spent half the game backtracking and doing bits and bobs of puzzles in a weird order until I figured out how the process of puzzle solving works in this game. Once you do get it it's exactly the same thing every time, doesn't get any harder, if anything with the last few it gets easier. A learning curve doesn't exist in this game.\n\nThis game is a pleasant experience and journey, and the basic story surrounding the family is rather moving, but don't expect much of a game or a challenge out of it, and I frankly wouldn't bother unless it's knocked down to under £10 in a steam sale. The whole atmospheric Lovecraftian point and click has been done far better before in my opinion in the Darkness Within games, which had more puzzles, more gameplay and a darker atmosphere to them, despite presumably having a considerably smaller budget and less slick graphics.\n\nP.S. As stated by reviews online and on steam, the autosave system does indeed leave a lot to be desired","February 13, 2015","false","6.3"," 28 of 46 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","28","46","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/idiobrando/recommended/258520/","idiobrando","I DIO!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/idiobrando/","517 products in account","For me personally Ethan Carter is a pretty disappointing, though still good, game.\n\nI've really come to love narrative driven games that focus on gameplay like exploration and roleplaying, Gone Home and Kentucky Route Zero being two of my favorite examples. Ethan Carter was supposed to be like them so I was really looking forward to it, but it ended up falling real short compared to them. Most of my disappointment stems from the fact that the devs, The Astronauts, have been in the industry for a while (They're ex-People Can Fly, including the founder) so I expected more than what we got narrative-wise.\n\nFirst of all the game really is gorgeous, the soundtrack is quality stuff, and the atmosphere really is great but this becomes a problem as you get deeper into the game, it’s clear The Astronauts put way too much focus on said environments instead of making an engaging game and narrative. Red Creek Valley is beautiful, but it’s empty. The whole game world is just too big for its own good so you'll tend to find yourself running through deserted forests with nothing to do. The gameplay also starts off promising with the investigation of murder scenes but this eventually becomes extremely watered down and the gameplay just kind of devolves into the exploration version of pixel hunting. And that's another problem of this game too, it’s just too obtuse at times. The Astronauts laud themselves for not holding your hand but it goes too far in the other direction and it can be tricky to find what you need to do to progress. Also not being able to manually save is just dumb and it just seems grognardy. Finally the obtuseness is more of a problem than it could have been because you have to find every puzzle in the game to beat it and if you missed some, which there is a good chance that you might, then it can just kind of kill the pacing right at the very end.\n\nThe narrative is also really barebones, which for what is supposed to be a narrative-driven game is a detriment. The characters are mostly all flat *ssholes so you really don’t care about them, which kind of alienates you from the plot. Plus the ending is just unfulfilling and just feels like a twist for the sake of one. In the end it didn’t leave an impression on me at all unlike some of the supernatural story-driven games I love like Silent Hill 2, Rule of Rose, and Deadly Premonition.\n\nThe Astronauts should have taken more cues from Gone Home. Gone Home may not have looked nearly as pretty and its world was much, much smaller but it was just so dense, filled with tons of stuff to find that built on the narrative that Ethan Carter really lacks. It also was tightly paced with no padding unlike Ethan Carter's wandering and backtracking.\n\nThis review sounds pretty negative, but it’s more out of knowing that this game could have been a lot better and out of disappointment over how hollow it feels due to the focus on style instead of substance. It’s still overall a good game  worth your time.  I’m just happy that so many people seem to enjoy this game. Video games don’t need combat to be games and video games can really tell engaging stories if the effort and skill are put into them. I want games like Ethan Carter, Walking Dead, Gone Home, and KRZ to succeed so  more can be made so despite my misgivings I’m glad Ethan Carter exists and is doing well and I hope The Astronauts can improve for a second game.","September 29, 2014","true","4.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I did a mistake by calling such a game an FPS (see my Stanley Parable review) so in order to avoid the ranting of other gamers let's clarify that while it does resemble that particular genre it does not have any weapons at your disposal.\n\nYou do not fight, you do not have boss battles, you do not even have levels to complete. You just walk in a vast, wonderfully crafted world and you are completely free to go anywhere you want to. You play a detective who arrives to the fictional area called Red Creek Valley to find a missing boy, Ethan Carter.\n\nYou can inspect objects throughout the game and you also find several dead bodies. The idea of every "section" of the game it to find out how the people in question were killed and by whom. Once all items / objects are found / inspected, you can utilise your sense ability which enables you to reassemble the murder from the various "memory" fragments given. Once the chronological order is selected properly you can move onto the next piece of mystery.\n\nI can't say enough how good the graphics are in this game. The atmosphere (thanks to the accompanying sound effects and music) is just excellent and it makes you stop and look at your surrounding area several times. And the game lets you do that - there's no time limit and no way to die and reload. You are free to complete the mystery at your own leisure.\n\nOh, yes, and while the game has excellent graphics it does run very well - I have to admit, though, I encountered some occasional stuttering which various forums seem to confirm. Hopefully, one patch will fix this as it is an underlying issue irrespective of the hardware you have for the game.\n\nTo summarise: Ethan Carter is an interesting, new take on adventure gaming. In my opinion, it is a rather unique and wonderfully done software that - and this is important to highlight - may not be to everybody's liking. However, if you liked Dear Esther, Gone Home or Stanley Parable you may just as well enjoy this one.","April 4, 2015","true","3.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","0"

I was spending most of the time playing just by strolling around through the best looking forest in my whole gaming life. Soo much love was put in every detail, every straw, placing of stones and trees. The textures are manifold, on the rocks, you rarely see the same in a certain radius again. The trees and grass is moving perfectly in the wind. It's a lively world even if there are no other NPC or even animals. Might be a negativ point, but would my grey GTX 680 be able to render such a graphic wonder in stereoscopic 3D? I'd doubt this.\n\nThe 3D vision support is execellent after applying the community patch. I have to say, this is going to be my new perfect example to show off the qualities of 3D vision to friends that are still reluctant regarding the most mind-breaking technology in PC gaming since Mario64's 3d world - if you don't know 3D vision, check on google. It will change your life. I rarely had such an immersive experience with a game in my life. It's similar to the first time I was playing Skyrim in 3D vision and walking through the fields and woods. Imagine a new Elderscrolls with such love to details, this kind of hand set environnement. But with a bigger areal, a huge living world. It would be mind-blowing. But it will come soon. I am certain.\n\nCan I recommend this game? Yes, I do. Besides of said qualities of the graphics it has a decent story to follow, even if it's honestly secondary with regard to the mere wandering through the beautiful and pitoresk landscape. The game might be a bit short, around 5 hours if you rush. Many more if you like to walk instead of run and do not bother yourself visiting a place twice. If it is too expensive for you at the moment, put it on your wishlist. You won't regret buying it someday when the price is right for you. If you have a 3D vision kit at home, this is the obligartory game for you.\n\nFor the love they put in the game I rate it with 9/10.

(c)\n\nThis game is perfect. It scared me out, it was filled with atmosphere of Hovard Lovecraft's stories, it is amazing.\n\n"The vanishing of Ethan Carter" is similar to the "Dear Esther". The protagonist, Paul Prospero, is the famous detective with paranormal abilities.  As we playing him, we walk around Red Creek Valley, hark Paul's monologues and, of course, find something, that distinguishes this game from "Dear Esther". Detective Prospero is able to seep through the dimension, he literally could go back in time. Thus, at the beginning of the game, as we get out of the railroad tracks, we encounter the traps, set in the forest. Once the player finds all traps, he can see a picture of the past and find a note, Ethan's story, which is called "Sap". Of course, the game doesn't make you to look for all traps, but player is free to do what he wants. Do you want to stay in the beginning and look for something interesting? You can do it! Do you want to go ahead, go out to the bridge, for example, and, do you see this house on the hill? You can go there, no problem!\n\nThe most important thing, and, that's what make the game pretty darn exciting, is opportunity to investigate the murders. And not just to find the instruments of crime, but also to recreate the picture of what happened and see how things were in fact and how it affected on the boy, Ethan, whom we're trying to save.\n\nThroughout the game the player can collect all the Ethan's stories (which, in my opinion, are very interesting). They won't affect the plot, but I personally recommend to walk around all of the available territory, and try to find them all, because these stories just add nice atmosphere to the game.\n\nWhat I would like to mention, for the whole game we found only one monster, which, of course, will try to kill us. It appears only once in game and he's not very difficult, though, to say honestly, I was very scared the first time I saw him.\n\nIn such games two issues are the most common: the atmosphere and the ending. In "The vanishing of Ethan Carter" developers have avoided these problems. They managed to create a wonderful, shrill atmosphere, and that's why you'd like to come back to this game. And, of course, ending of game... It was damn cool. I don't want spoilers in my review (:\n\nIn general, "The vanishing of Ethan Carter" turned out to cheer.

However, keep in mind that it is very short. By very short, I mean VERY short. I finished everything in under four hours. Everything. With that being said, it really is a great game. I wish there were more puzzles, and I wish some of the puzzles were better developed, but I still thoroughly enjoyed the ones that were there. The scenerey is the best I've ever seen. Seriously, it is gorgeous. The story is interesting, and as another revewer explained it, this whole game is basically poetry. While it is short, it is very deep. The controls are simple, and the gameplay is pretty straightforward.  Even though I enjoyed it while I was playing it, but I don't see myself coming back any time soon. Keep in mind its very short length. If the length is an issue, maybe wait for a discount to pick this one up. However, it is definitley worth playing.\n\n7.8/10\n+Scenery +Puzzles +Scenery +Interesting story  +Did I mention scenery?\n-Short -Few puzzles -Some underdeveloped puzzles","November 29, 2014","true","4.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Bluntly, yes - But it's a 4 hours you'd be happy you gave up when you finish the game.\n\nIt's hard to explain this game without giving much away, but I'll try. You play as Paul Pospero, a detective who traveled to Red Creek Valley to find Ethan Carter. On the journey, you'll see that a lot more has gone on than the fact that Ethan has gone. The twist is that you can see in to the past when core objects related to the mystery are found and put in their correct places.\n\nWhen you get dropped in to the game, it's all down to you, the whole "This game does not hold your hand" screen at the beginning really means it.

I'd say, if you are in to atmospheric stuff, puzzle games, or just really like good looking environments, this game is absolutely for you.\n\nI'll say it right away; this game is quite short. Like most indie games that seem to surpass that level of quality that we "expect" when something is made on such a small scale (Journey, Dear Esther). As an Indie developer you can only make a game truly good if it's short (we're talking about linear traditional type of games, where it takes a long time to set up environments and set pieces). Either you make it linear and short, or you can make it open (which is a hit or miss design choice) and very long.\n\nNot only is it short, but it also has very little replayability. There aren't many things to "discover" that aren't already integral to your progression in the game. So once you've finished, you've done everything there is to do, as far as I know.\n\nSo it's safe to say that TVOEC is one of those games that might not be worth the full price, if you don't appreciate short, but good games. I'm sure it will go on sale soon, anyways.\n\n(I'll try not to spoil anything or even mention the narrative)\n\nYou kind of go in to this game not knowing much about it. It's called "The Vanishing of Ethan Carter", but who is Ethan Carter, and why are we here? How do we find Ethan? Do we find him at all? Is he real? Is anything real? What do I do? That's probably my favorite aspect of this game: It doesn't hold your hand, it gives you MINIMAL information and you get to put the peices together at your own pace. That's very much missing in most games these days.\n\nThe game starts out putting you right in the beautiful forest of Red Creek Valley. You''ll be impressed by the visual fidelity. Screenshots don't have anything on the actual beauty of seeing this game in motion. It has a very moody, melancholic aesthetic. You could say that it's "photo realistic" but no, I cannot agree with that. It has realistic assets, but the actual treatment of movement, sound, and color are not realistic, they're romantic and depressing (in true Swede nature).\n\nOnce you get to the first few puzzles, which are surreal, HP lovecraftian mini-adventures, you'll notice that some of them are thematically unrelated, that's because their only connection are narrative. There's sci-fi, fantasy, modern fiction, ect. all to be found in this game's stories. Which is actually incredibly creepy. It's hard to pinpoint why. I guess the surprise of seeing something so disconnected from what you expect the game to throw at you can be really off-putting (hopefully in a good way though).\n\nThe consistent mechanics that go in to the strictly narrative parts of this game are fairly straight forward, you inspect things, find a dead body, and find out what happened by placing everything in the place where they were before the murder, and "contact the dead".

Some former employees of People Can Fly were responsible for this game, and apparently they got the employee who knew all about making beautiful enviroments. So there's a bunch of rotting old machinery among woodland forests, but it's organized so thoughtfully and animated so well that it all just seems perfectly natural and you're immersed in fears of tetanus and hidden mountain lions. Mountain lions are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nThe second - and this is a huge point of contention for people as to whether the game should be bought - is pretty much a supernatural murder mystery played out between sparse puzzles in stretches of beautiful woodland forest over three hours for twenty bucks. There are some nice puzzles on display - supernatural elements play into the game heavily here, all punctuated at the end by a story written by the title character. I assure you it's not an obnoxious Stephen King style 'oooh, the little kid's imagination is special, call the ♥♥♥♥ing Overlook Hotel and ask for Mr. Torrance' plot point. There's variation, but not much of it. At one point, you have the opportunity to play a Splendaman-style (featuring the titular Splendaman character, who is Ryan Gosling of 'Drive' fame sneaking up on housewives to sell them sucralose-based sweetener) 'find the six corpses to unlock the exit' type puzzle, so I hope that all the Youtube Let's Players have bought this to scream in terrified horror at the broken oil lamps or bunnies in broad daylight. The annoying thing is, you have to stop and solve all of the murder mysteries before you can get to the end of the game, which I didn't feel the sting of because I'm the kind of smarty-man detective who worked out the murders as I went along. AND I did the house puzzle without any pen or paper, because I have a wonderful taste for ghost towns and old house layouts. So nyeh.\n\nIt's a decent game, but if you don't think it's worth the price, wait for a Steam sale. And do not, under any circumstances, use the comment section to complain about price or I will throw a battery at you.","March 28, 2015","true","3.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

To do so, you end up in a forest, trying to search for clues to retrieve the little boy.\n\nFirst of all, the first thing that you will see when playing Ethan Carter is that the game is beautiful. A lot of work was done on the vegetation of the forest (as well as the buildings, the water, everything !) just to make it look as realist as possible. And it worked ! I found myself starring at some landscapes for minutes just because it looked so real.\n\nSince you're a detective, you'll have to find clues and interact with some of them to be able to reconstruct the crime scenes. After you found every clue, you now have the ability to revisit the crime. To do that, there are 4 or 5 visuals and you'll have to define the chronology of the events. This aspect of the game is pretty easy and it's well done. The story is really interesting and you'll want to know what happened in this strange forest and why Ethan went missing.\n\n"This game won't take you by the end".  In Ethan Carter, you're free to go wherever you go when you want. It's possible to miss some puzzles the first time and you'll have to come back later to do it (not sure if you have to do EVERY puzzle in the game to see the endgame). The puzzles are fairly easy. The only difficult part in my opinion would be finding a specific object when you have no clue about it's location. You know it's near but it could be everywhere on the ground.\n\nI would definitely recommend Ethan Carter to everyone who wants to play a good adventure game which isn't too hard to get into.

It was only when I saw that one of my favourite Youtubers, Sips_ , uploaded a play-through of it that I decided to check it out. I quickly saw that it was a story driven game that I would not want to ruin my watching a video, so I didn’t.\n\nThe Vanishing of Ethan Carter was developed and published by an unknown developed called The Astronauts, but this team is made up of some well known people (including Adrian Chmielarz, who was the director of People Can Fly) It is really lovely to see a small team of developers get together like this and make a game extremely refreshing and delightful to play.\n\nThe story of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is really one that you need to play for yourself, do not try and watch a few ‘Let’s Play’ videos of it because this game is a wonderful experience that will be ruined if you just watch someone else play it. The game starts of with the introduction of the character you are playing in this tale, and that is a supernatural detective called Paul Prospero. Paul received a fan letter from a young lad, Ethan Carter (who has…well…vanished) This letter described supernatural on-goings that no young boy should experience. Already knowing of Ethan’s disappearance, Paul has made it his mission to find out what is going on in the small town of Red Creek Valley, and to find the young Ethan Carter before it is too late.  Want to know more of the story? Well I am not going to spoil anything, play it yourself!\n\nThe Vanishing of Ethan Carter  is a first person detective game, with the events that Ethan Carter has suffered through have already completed. It is your job (well, Paul’s job) to find those clues scattered around and to put them into chronological order to how you believed it had happened – you will then see the story behind those clues. Each part to the story is split into different scenes, the clues are located in roughly the same area so that you won’t be trawling through the map trying to find clues that you may have missed – as long as you make sure you don’t just run through everything without paying attention, but you won’t have to run from one end of the map to the other because you missed one clue. Be sure to read all notes and stories that Ethan has left behind for somebody to read, they are all gems.\n\nThe story takes you through a few different locations in Red Creek Valley, and all these locations are as beautiful as the next.  The Vanishing of Ethan Carter may be the best looking game I have ever played, no over-reaction.  I spent the first couple of hours just wandering around taking screenshots to upload to my Steam profile, that is how beautiful it is – I even posted these screenshots onto websites and people would be astonished and ask what game it was!  I am amazed at the sheer effort The Astronauts went through to make these photo-realistic scenes, there is a wonderful article written by Andrzej Poznanski on The Astronauts website about how they achieved this, http://www.theastronauts.com/2014/03/visual-revolution-vanishing-ethan-carter/ it is a great read.\n\nWhat is a great looking game with no atmosphere? The sounds in The Vanishing of Ethan Carter were as top notch as everything else. Just walking through the woodlands and hearing the wind gently whistling past with the steps my character made as he walked through some thick grass was nothing short of immersing, I really did feel like I was in the game – in the story. Gently playing in the background was the soundtrack to the game which was composed by Mikołaj Stroiński, who has also worked on the upcoming Witcher 3 Wild Hunt. The soundtrack was very peaceful, relaxing and something I would definitely buy and have on my iPod (in fact, I may check to see if they sell the OST now) Whenever I hear the music that was in the game, It instantly takes me back to the game and the great experience that I had – and in my opinion, that is what makes a good soundtrack.\n\nThe game ran very well on my GTX 980 and i7 4770k and I was getting constant 60 frames per second with only minimal drops from time to time. I was playing on the highest settings on 1080p, but there were plenty of alterations you could make to the quality of the game. If your PC is a bit older, drop a few of the settings and it will still look great.\n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend buying The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. If you are not much into story driven games where you are not running around shooting people – then this game may not be for you, but anyone who loves a good story with a sit back and relax nature to it (except one of the missions!) then definitely pick this up. The game spans around 5 hours, so if you are not sure if the game is for you, you may wish to wait until a sale or until it drops a bit in price – but at the current value, I would recommend it.\n\n\nFor more reviews, head over to http://www.ordinarygamer.co.uk/2015/01/27/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-review/","January 27, 2015","true","5.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

And, when I saw the beautiful scenery and the paranormal element in the trailer, I knew I want this game. Soon, it was released and not much later there was a discount, so I bought it. It had a promise of a mesmerizing game and it was! The gamer's perfect story, right?\n\nAs to the details, there isn't much to tell. It is a beautiful game and that's the reason to buy it. The puzzle element isn't that difficult (once you've figured the mechanics). It's more about observance skills than intelligence. The story is influenced by macabre writings of such authors like H.P. Lovecraft, which I'm fan of. But ultimately it's very sad and leaves a touchmark of melancholy with you for some time.\n\nApart from minor bugs and inconvenience with the launch screen, there are no faults in this game. And the developers are really polite and supportive.\n\nIf you're looking for mesmerizing, atmospheric kind of game with some elements of mystery, then this game is for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrJenssen/recommended/258520/","MrJenssen","MrJenssen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrJenssen/","520 products in account","\nThe Vanishing of Ethan Carter was, prior to release, one of my most anticipated indie games of the year. And can you blame me? The game looked fantastic. The story, atmosphere and gameplay all gave off this mysterious, minimalist vibe. When it finally launched, I didn’t waste a second not playing the game to completion. And then again. And again. Though this wasn’t only because I enjoyed the experience so much.\n\nThe first thing you should know - in case the pre-release gameplay footage had you thinking otherwise - is that Ethan Carter is a very linear game. Though you do have some freedom in which order you wish to solve the various puzzles and events you come across, it’s still a rather short and directed experience. But that shouldn’t hold you back, because the moments of true awe stand in line to reveal themselves to you one at a time. Nothing ever goes on for too long, you’ll never get bored of anything. It’s rather the opposite - you’ll wish there was more of it, At least a couple more puzzles or something. No, game! Please! Don’t just end! Not now! We were having such a good time! Four hours is simply not enough! Nooooo!\n\nThough the game is pretty much perfect in every conceivable technical way - from graphics to sound to the mechanics - it isn’t quite perfect overall. It really does feel the game is a little too short, and even an additional half hour or hour extra would’ve helped tremendously. There’s “short and sweet”, and then there’s “too short and too sweet.” Secondly, for a game that claims it doesn’t hold your hand, it wobbles a bit too much between “this is how you do it” and “screw you, find your own way!” Though the game’s soundtrack is absolutely mesmerizing, the voice acting is only alright and never much more. Additionally, the story is decent but never much more than that. But if you go in expecting a directed artistic experience rather than some sort of open-world game, then I really can’t imagine you not loving it...especially the climax following that one chase in the forest. But hush, I’ve said too much already. Just go play it. You’ll wish it lasted longer, but only because it’s THAT good.\n\nArbitrary meaningless score:\n4.5/5","March 31, 2015","true","6.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Raztaman/recommended/258520/","Raztaman","Raztaman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Raztaman/","279 products in account","The game has many interesting moments and is very unique in how it plays amongst today's games, almost playing like a novel. However, the end seems very rushed, giving the feeling of a total cop-out, with almost the entire plot being open to interpretation and no definitive closure actually being given. Towards the end (which I didn't realise it would be at the time) I was very hopeful for more plot to unveil, but then suddenly finished the game and was left with more questions (in a negative way, not positive) than a sense of completion.\n\nPhilosophically and visually, this game is very enjoyable but the let down of the seemingly rushed plot towards the end means that this game isn't worth the price tag in my opinion. I believe more depth on each character's actions and their turn of events would be required to make this game truly great, and it could've easily been one of the most unique and thought-provoking games of today if more tangible events had been included.\n\nPros:\n- Stunning graphics that will have you stopping quite often simply to take in the scenery.\n- Excellent take on story telling; very unique and novel-like.\n- Audio is generally very captivating.\n- Very immersive, could be a perfect game for oculus rift.\n\nCons:\n- Plot can be very 'patchy' with a lack of definitive information.\n- Late-game seems very very rushed with a lack of build up and leading between events.\n- End game feels like a cop-out in comparison to the rest of the game; it just suddenly finishes.\n- Voice acting can be sub par as well as character models.\n- Graphical glitches and slight performance issues can affect immersion negatively.\n- No allowance of quicksaving could be detrimental to individuals' freedom of progression.\n- Short play time (4/5 hours) is only made a problem by the strange, uneven pacing.\n\nGenerally I would recommend this game, however be warned that although it seems very well made at first, the lack of developer experience (in this rare genre of game) pokes through once you've completed the game and look back on your experience. If there is a sequel or expansion planned then this would be more understandable but this shouldn't have to be the case either way.\n\nA score of 70/100 would almost be generous, but will be given simply because the generally enjoyable aspects of the game can outweigh the many annoyances scattered throughout the story.","November 4, 2014","true","6.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

I have not played many mystery-games before, so I was quite new to the genre when booting up the game. The mechanics are quite fascinating, but even though innovative it does become stale. I am not sure I feel it lives quite up to it's price. I grabbed it at a sale, and am personally happy with the experience. I haven't completely finished the game yet, but it takes a lot for me to finish games.\n\nWhilst the game looks amazing, and the mechanics are very cool at first; that's not what grabbed me with this game. It was the atmosphere. The seemingly vast landscape created a sense of solitude; the kind of "no-one-can-hear-you-scream" kind of thing. The game executes this flawlessly. At first I thought this was going to be a pure horror game; as you walk through the abandoned, dark buildings the game produces quite a creepy vibe.\n\nIf you're new to the genre; buy it. If you've played a lot of mystery games before this might seem a bit dull. All in all I do recommend it, but buy it at a sale.","January 19, 2015","true","3.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

When you the player were exploring Outer Space in the forest area & releasing the Kraken in the mines it was a way of telling the player on Ethan's influences on writing which were H.P. Lovecraft, Jules Verne, Edgar Allan Poe, H.G. Wells & many other authors whenever he went to the attic to find new ideas for stories to share to his family.\n\nWhen I found a bank letter in the mines I understood some part of Ethan's neglect from his family since the Dad owed money or something so when the family went poor they took their aggression to their introverted son Ethan who was talented with literature. Another thing about the murders is that the sick fantasies Ethan had while he was unconscious was his way to stay awake & his dad commiting suicide through one of his murder fantasies helped him stay conscious a little while longer through the smoke.\n\nOverall I can understand the amount of awards the game got, it's a good game that makes you think & if I missed anything feel free to leave feedback.","September 23, 2015","true","12.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

The experience is enhanced by the terrific job done by the voice actor playing Paul Prospero - you, the protagonist - as well as a music score that knows when to leave the background and sting you when the time is right.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's a first-person puzzle game-slash-visual-narrative in which the puzzles blend seamlessly into the story. You are a detective looking to solve a mystery. Piecing things together is your life's work, so here's an example of a perfect marriage between narrative device and game mechanics. User interface is simple and unobtrusive, interaction cues popping into view only and only when they're absolutely necessary, most of the time leaving the screen entirely available for the tasty pieces of eye candy the game throws at you.\n\nAll in all, an intense albeit short experience which I emphatically recommend. Indeed, upon reaching the end of the game (which should take between 3 and 5 hours, depending on how often you stop to smell the flowers), unless you've got a heart filled with sand, you're bound to feel the game's emotional toll.

I have to say, this one is the perfect connection of all three games. Alan Wake tires you with pew pew pew which pushes the awesome story in the background, Dear Esther is done after 90 minutes and Murdered: Soul Suspect had kind of a fake/unreal way to interact with proofs. While Dear Esther is one of my most favourite games, this is finally something similar to it.\n\nEven the (few) negative reviews can't deny that the graphics of this game are incredibly good, you have 4 hours in the quality of a cinematic cutscene.\nPeople complain about puzzles being too simple, walking for 2 minutes without meeting anyone (this is not The Elder Scrolls), but in my opinion it's about the story anyways, which is really great.\n\nThis is one of the few games that is more a novel to play, no shooting, no questmarkers, no HUD about health, ammo and compass. Just a story and awesome graphics.\n\nYou can discuss about the price, but I highly recommend buying the game when it is on sale.\nIf you liked Alan Wake for the story (and not for the shooting) and think Dear Esther was too short (such story much cry very tears wow), then you should get The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.","October 12, 2014","true","6.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I remember some early marketing describing greatness of the game, telling that the game location's are based on existing ones. And that the story and the gameplay is nothing more and nothing less but eerie fairy tale everyone should experience. I had my hopes quite high, I bloody adore adventure games. But eh, it's not that simple with this one. And I'm not one of these who drool over 60FPS and 4K somethin' stuff.\n\nI pay more attention to the story, it's the most important part of adventure game. It needs to keep you going, to keep you engaged, so you want to solve yet another puzzle and push things forward. Well, Vanishing of Ethan Carter does fail here - the story starts interesting and the fact that you aren't meant to meet anyone on your way to solve the riddle leaves you up with your thoughts. You keep wondering what exactly happened there, in Red Creek Valley, and eventually you are disappointed. Because the ending is cliché as hell.\nIt's worth playing once, but this is not a tale you will remember. A rather short, 4 hours movie.\n\nOn the other hand - grahpics are really good. I can't help but think that this is a bit of waste, considering how amazing would it be to implement them into some full size RPG game. I mean - this is the world you want to discover and explore - but there is not much to do. It's a bit linear game with great atmosphere. But that's all.\n\nMy final rating? - 6/10\n\n+ Falling leaves.\n+ Easy and short. May be perfect for people who prefer 'tell-a-tale' games.\n\n- The story.

I am, however, entirely OK with it. It's an impactful, atmospheric experience to hike through this painterly landscape with events going on around you that regularly blur the line between the supernatural and the mundane. The violence in this game is, in fact, more affecting since you as the player never swing a sword or fire a gun.\n\nPuzzles await you at numerous locations in the valley. They use simple mechanics, mostly to good effect. This game isn't trying to be a full on puzzle game, there aren't enough puzzles for that, but what's there generally does a good job of keeping you thinking and feeling involved. A few of them did frustrate me though. Keeping things vague, there was an instance where the missing piece that I needed was a smallish object on the ground that I didn't realize I could pick up until it was highlighted as I stumbled over it. Another case left me unsure where to go when a small drop in water level opened up a new path that wasn't sufficiently obvious.\n\nClocking in at five hours for a thorough, 100% completion playthrough, this game's biggest weakness is that the journey ends too soon. I switched from the Redux version to the original for a second time through and this time finished everything in 110 minutes. I noticed little difference between the two versions. No change in the story or puzzles and the visuals were about the same. The save system in Redux is superior and the default camera movement controls were also preferable in Redux. Unfortunately, with the mysteries of the story unraveled, my second go-round lost much of the magic. There isn't much replay value here unless you just want to look at the scenery, which may very well be worthwhile in VR, but I can't comment on that from personal experience.","May 13","true","1.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","2"

You play a paranormal detective who is able to pick up clues from murder scenes to piece together what has happened. As you find a scene and investigate, you must figure out the sequence of events that led up to the murder, which will unlock a final extra scene giving further context to the killing.\n\nThe scenery is beautiful, rivalling (and topping) the natural beauty found in games like Dear Esther. It could be described as a 'walking simulator' (apparantly a derogatory term for slower games where you wander the environment without killing anything), you don't use weapons or directly fight anything here, this game is rooted in exploration, investigation and a building sense of uneasiness. The story isn't exactly subtle with its fantasy, horror and sci-fi genre tropes, some of which really clash against the beautifully natural feeling of the world, forcing your suspension of disbelief early on. However, if you accept that the game goes to wacky crazy places, you can have some fun here.\n\nThe story is both subtle and heavy handed at times, I recommend taking it slowly and reading every item and looking at environmental clues to get the full story.","September 26, 2014","true","3.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

(which only adds to make you want to finish it even more)\n+CREEPY FACTOR! - Now normally this is something that I'd chalk up to the 'spooky' atmosphere or jump scares, but the thing was...there WEREN'T any of the cliche' scares of old. I was constantly looking behind my shoulder to turn and see...NOTHING I was just flatout scared! (immediately regretting playing this game in the dark w/my headphones on)\n+Puzzle Mechanics - there's nothing more satisfying that finding every clue and placing each step of the 'death' in chronological order. This isn't just a walk in the park, you have to THINK and WORK at it, but you feel a great sense of satisfaction knowing you're moving the story along and getting one step closer to finding Ethan.\n\nCONS:\n-- Um...let me think...\n-- Just give me a sec...\n-- DONT PRESSURE ME!!

As you find more clues, you progress through the story getting that much closer to your goal (finding out what happened to Ethan Carter.\n\nThe controls? They're pretty much what you want and need for this game. You move and then have 2 buttons for sprinting and interacting.\n\nThe story? Very average, what starts off like a good detective bit only evolves to a messy and sloppy story. That's the sad part as the story is supposed to be the no.1 thing for this kind of game.\n\nI cannot recommend this game to anyone because the story is sub-par, the game doesn't offer anything that we haven't already seen. My review is late so there's alot of walking simulators like this on the market that do one thing or another better than this game. Overall, unoriginal and uninspired, just a lack of interesting things and only really good for one playthrough realistically.\n\nTruly amazing graphics though...","March 6","false","2.6"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","6"

The puzzles aren't as easy as some people pretend they are, however not unsolvable. It is very atmospheric, very eerie and dark at some times, and at other times you wish you could jump in and enjoy what looks to be a crisp, warm autumn day.\nI recommend this game to you if you want a mystery that you can sink your teeth into for a few hours and enjoy wandering through gorgeous scenery with a reaslistic environment.

Despite the short completion time the game has a fairly slow pace, giving you time to really soak in the environment as you walk from puzzle to puzzle. There's no real explanation given as to how to solve the puzzles but seeing as they are largely straight forward I never found myself frustrated (with the exception of the infamous mine puzzle). Although not hard, the lack of any hints really made finding a solution that much more rewarding.\n\nThe story is fairly interesting and carries a sense of mystery all the way until the end. The story might not stick in your head in the way something like "Gone Home" might, but it holds your attention throughout. It's primarily going to be the environment that keeps you wanting to explore. That said, the ending I found particularly good, I want to stress though that the ending seems to generate polarizing opinions.\n\nLooking to the cons, there really weren't that many, The mine stands out though, it's fairly visually uninteresting, and also contains the most irritating puzzle in the game. Sometimes it could be argued that certain spaces were lit poorly and as a result you really missed out on seeing all there was to see. I did also encounter one bug in my play through, it lead to the game becoming unresponsive and I lost maybe 15 minutes of progress. It didn't repeat though and just seemed like on of those unlucky things that can randomly occur in most games.\n\nI think you'd probably enjoy this game if you liked "Ether One" or to a lesser extent "Dear Esther". Overall I was quite pleased with what I got for my £15. I have little doubt I'll be loading it up again soon, but not to play through the story again, just to wander through the map. It's solid game that managed to really do a lot with such a short run time. It doesn't run for any longer than it needs to nor does it cram every second with gameplay or exposition. The time between the puzzles really gives you a chance to reflect on the mystery and enjoy the beautiful game world.\n\n8.5/10\n","October 18, 2014","true","3.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It really wasn't what I was expecting and it's hard to decribe what I mean by that. It's often bewildering, sometimes strange, but it's always intriguing. Yes ok so it's played from a first person perspectvie and you have walk about looking at stuff to find those all important clues and like any mystery game there are notes and letters just dropped on the ground for the player to discover. Familiar game mechanics? Of course they are, but in this game they do tell a fascinating supernatural story and are definetly not filler or collectibles.\n\nYou play the game as Paul Prospero 'a supernatural detective' and I imagine him as a cigar smoking, fedora wearing type not unlike Columbo, but I don't want to put images in your head. Anyway you've been summoned via a handwritten letter to Red Creek Valley by Ethan Carter, a young boy who appears to be in some kind of trouble and it is clear that he is going to need your help and to do that you'll need to don that fedora and do some investigating.\n\nAs you examine the clues you find in the game world and interactive with objects Propsero’s inner thoughts are displayed on screen. Subtle clues to help you gather evidence and fit the pieces together. Find the correct order and the events are played back in supernatural film-reel style with a blue filter that act as cut scenes progressing the story.\n\nA point to note is that the game makes it very clear even before you start out on your journey that "This game is a narrative experience that does not hold your hand." That means there are no quest markers, no maps, no golden Fable-esq trail to follow. Just your own noggin to guide you. There are just a few clues to discover in the game world and you must explore, explore and explore. The world is a very beautiful place though and you'll frequently find yourself stopping just to admire the view. It would be unfair to just praise the visuals as the the musical score is equally beautiful, but also subtle and haunting, fitting perfectly with exploration and discovery.\n\nIf you are into narrative experiences with lots of exploring required and a thought-provoking backstory to encourage you forward then you will definitely enjoy The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.","April 5, 2015","true","9.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The story is intriguing, the gameplay is unique, and the graphics are hands down some of the best in the history of gaming so far. The product is not without it's cons; however, it is still a polished and compelling game overall.\n\nSTORY (spoiler free)\n\nYou're a paranormal detective who journeys to a place called Red Creek Valley to find a boy named Ethan Carter, who sent you fan mail that intruiges you to invesitgate some of his claims. When you arrive, you find out that a strange evil has claimed the town, and an adventure of mystery, horror, and hope ensues.\n\nOverall, the narrative is solid, if not a little too vague at times. But with that said, it keeps you immersed throughout the entire experience, and is one of the defining factors of the game.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe game is played from a first-person perspective. As usual, you're basically just an invisible floating head, which means you can't see your hands, feet, or any other part of your body. Levers and switches seem to move on their own. Items are picked up by invisible your invisible hands. While this is a minor gripe, I think it would have made the game much more realistic.\n\nPrimarily, you explore a decently sized open world map, solving puzzles and searching for clues on what to do next. The pacing is brilliant, that is, until you have to backtrack over large distances just because you missed a small element. By the time I reached the endgame, I had to go back and complete other "missions" because I'd so easily missed them as I passed by. This is another minor gripe, as the game itself tells you that it won't hold your hand throughout the experience. Keep your eyes sharp. But hold onto your seats as well, as there are some jump scares. The puzzles are relatively easy, but most require a ton of thinking.\n\nTraversal is almost entirely by foot. There's a zoom function for taking DOF lessened screenshots. and a sprint button (which you'll be holding down almost the entire time). There's also a neat easter egg which either requires you to have the knowledge of the steps before hand, or blind luck to solve it.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nBy far, the game's most defining quality. My jaw hit the floor when I first booted up the game, and there are plenty of "wow" moments throughout the adventure. Almost every environment looks spectacular, and the level of detail is incredible. Textures are photorealistic, and looks amazing coupled with cinematic effects. Character models are also extremely detailed. The entire world is designed to give you that surreal-dream-like feel, and it pulls you into this virtual world. It's insane.\n\nAlso take note, the game is running on the Unreal 3 engine, pushed to the limits. Performance is great, but as always, comes down to what rig you have. An update which upgrades the engine to the breathtaking Unreal 4 is in development at the time of this review.\n\nOVERALL\n\nWhile I recommend this to everyone, don't buy it expecting Call of Duty or Skyrim. This is a puzzle solving, story heavy, visually stunning experience. It clocks in pretty short though, I completed the game in around four hours, and that was with a lot of restarting and general goofing around. But don't let that sway you into not buying it. It's well worth the asking price, and unbeatable during sales.\n\nRATING; 9.5/10","July 23, 2015","true","6.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

It really wasn't what I was expecting and it's hard to decribe what I mean by that. It's often bewildering, sometimes strange, but it's always intriguing. Yes ok so it's played from a first person perspectvie and you have walk about looking at stuff to find those all important clues and like any mystery game there are notes and letters just dropped on the ground for the player to discover. Familiar game mechanics? Of course they are, but in this game they do tell a fascinating supernatural story and are definetly not filler or collectibles.\n\nYou play the game as Paul Prospero 'a supernatural detective' and I imagine him as a cigar smoking, fedora wearing type not unlike Columbo, but I don't want to put images in your head. Anyway you've been summoned via a handwritten letter to Red Creek Valley by Ethan Carter, a young boy who appears to be in some kind of trouble and it is clear that he is going to need your help and to do that you'll need to don that fedora and do some investigating.\n\nAs you examine the clues you find in the game world and interactive with objects Propsero’s inner thoughts are displayed on screen. Subtle clues to help you gather evidence and fit the pieces together. Find the correct order and the events are played back in supernatural film-reel style with a blue filter that act as cut scenes progressing the story.\n\nA point to note is that the game makes it very clear even before you start out on your journey that "This game is a narrative experience that does not hold your hand." That means there are no quest markers, no maps, no golden Fable-esq trail to follow. Just your own noggin to guide you. There are just a few clues to discover in the game world and you must explore, explore and explore. The world is a very beautiful place though and you'll frequently find yourself stopping just to admire the view. It would be unfair to just praise the visuals as the the musical score is equally beautiful, but also subtle and haunting, fitting perfectly with exploration and discovery.\n\nIf you are into narrative experiences with lots of exploring required and a thought-provoking backstory to encourage you forward then you will definitely enjoy The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.","April 5, 2015","true","9.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I'll get the obvious out of the way first: It's one of the most vibrant, visually beautiful games I've seen in a long time. The new "Redux" upgrade version especially brings the environment to life and the accompanying soundtrack compliments with its haunting score. But the story is where the game really shines. The narrative puts you in the shoes of a detective on the search for a missing boy, the titual "Ethan Carter". As you progress, you come upon clues that you must piece together to solve various crimes that all tie together with the disappearance. Without spoiling the story, everything comes together into an ending that you really don't see coming, and so makes the impact all the more powerful.\n\nHowever, the game isn't without some (minor) flaws. The puzzle mechanic involved in piecing together the clues is obscure. You are literally warned that there will be no hand-holding on the learning curve and that's pretty accurate. The first puzzle will likely require some Google-Fu to get the hang of how the mechanics work. But once you've got the idea, the rest are pretty self-explanatory.\n\nThe game is also not always as linear as it may appear. Some of the sequences you need to complete in order to finish the game you risk missing because they require you wander the forest around you, with no real guide as to what is expected. But helpfully, you'll be supplied a fast-travel system near the end to help you re-trace anything you may have missed, so it's not a huge problem.\n\nThose minor nitpicks aside, it's a great game with a memorable story. Definitely recommended.","September 17, 2015","true","0.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slowhoney/recommended/258520/","slowhoney","carnivalnights","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slowhoney/","844 products in account","Despite the game's visual beauty, and though I would not place this game in the horror genre, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a macabre story depicting several horrific and depressing deaths in a very immersive and atmospheric world set in the desolate Red Creek Valley.  It combines point-and-click adventure with detective and mystery genres, spotted with a few puzzles and many flashbacks from the dead. The dark forces behind this story follow you throughout the game but do not progress beyond “creepy” or “grim.”\n\nProtagonist and narrator Paul Prospero is a seasoned detective with supernatural abilities that allow him to visualize the chronology and detail of crimes after piecing together evidence. Since you play as this single living character in the game, your skills are the only way to uncover the mysterious story of Ethan, a young boy who writes to you with a very disturbing problem. As you wonder through the game, you slowly uncover bits and pieces of Ethan’s story and disappearance, solving murders one-by-one, all in a non-linear fashion that allows you to go at your own pace and venture backwards if you miss something.\n\nThough you cannot die in the game, the opening screen does warn, “This game is a narrative experience that does not hold your hand.” The game’s focus is exploration, relying on your observation skills to proceed and uncover the pieces of the story. There are no tips, no maps, no character interactions and no instructions – it’s just you and the forest. Most of the time, there are a couple of cues to let you know you have cleared an area, usually the flashback of a character’s final moments. You have limited abilities: walk, run, crouch, interact. And there is no combat. This game is entirely story-driven and certainly atmospheric in terms of visuals, mood and environment.\n\nThis game is a visual and auditory masterpiece. With the use of photogrammetry technology, the open world created here is painstakingly realistic and overwhelmingly stunning. Aside from pieces of the game that explore houses and a mine, it is entirely outdoors – during daylight – and full of rich forestry sprinkled with bodies of water. You can climb rock peaks in certain areas to get a better view, and even the far and distant scenery is texture-rich and detailed. Sun peaks through the trees, piercing the shadows, and it will sometimes fill your screen as you turn a corner into a clearing. A beautiful instrumental soundtrack accompanies you throughout the game (the theme is particularly luring), changing from scene to scene, but is in no way obtrusive to the other auditory genius of the game: wind blowing, leaves falling, bird chirping, branches creaking, rustling undergrowth, breezes swaying trees and grass, and your constant footsteps, changing slightly depending on what is beneath you (grass, branches, rock, water) and whether you are walking or running. All perfectly timed and all authentic. The grim storyline is pierced with these wonderfully peaceful nature highlights.\n\nThe game can be completed in roughly four hours, but it was a very much enjoyed four hours for me. There are two not-so-obvious achievements, but other than those, you will be able to obtain 12/14 just by completing the game. Though a lot of indie games tend to have at least a few bugs or glitches, I did not personally come across a single one during my gameplay, which was very impressive. Also, Steam lists this game as having Partial Controller Support but I was able to use my Xbox controller throughout the game without ever having to resort to a mouse, even in the menus, just in case anyone was curious.\n\nThough two very different games, if you were a fan of Murdered: Soul Suspect, you will likely enjoy this. The games share many similar elements, including the investigative elements and the supernatural elements like flashbacks in order to reveal story. Both plots are very unique and have not been done before.\n\nAs short as it was, this has been one of my favourite games of 2014. Even if you have no interest in the story, it deserves a playthrough simply for the visuals. Stunning game with a very interesting story.","December 27, 2014","true","6.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There's a lot of getting lost, and the story requires an eye for detail if you want to be able to progress the story whilst getting a full insight.

There are two types of "interactive" encounters in the game: solving murders that have occurred through that spirit's memories and a handful of puzzles of varying complexity.  Unfortunately, there are far more of the former than the latter, with there only being three real puzzles in the entire game (and one of those barely counts as a puzzle).  The crime solving parts were interesting but too simplistic to really challenge me in any way.\n\nIf you are coming to this looking for a purely narrative experience, it isn't bad (albeit a little overpriced).

That certain place made me wanna quit the game, and when I actually had to return to it after finished all the other puzzles I had to be brave!\n\nAnyway, the game has two different mechanics, one is to solve these murder cases, you get to find the murder object, how the murder happened, and so on. You also get to point out the chronology of the murder, one example: Did he lose his legs before or after he was hit in the head?\n\nThat mechanic alone is quite unique in gaming, at least if you compare it to similar games I've played.\nThe other mechanic is more puzzle solving, some harder than others, one was particulary easy, too easy.\nBut the cool thing with these puzzles is that they reward us with more details of the story and also visually stunning places, also here some more than others. That particular easy puzzle rewarded us with one of the coolest settings in the game. The story of the game is very mysterious and you are throughout the game thinking "Where is this taking me?

I spent a LOT of time backtracking to finish stuff I missed the first time.\n\nOverall impressions:  If you like detective stories and outdoor atmosphere, you'll probably like this.  If you liked Alan Wake but hated the combat, I'm guessing you'll like this (I haven't played the Alan Wake games).  If you liked Dear Esther but wished it had even some mild puzzle elements, you'll probably like this.\n\nThe bad:\nThe open nature of the maps actually made me spend a lot of time backtracking because I missed a couple of simple triggers early in the game.  This made the story unfold in a weird manner, which is not really bad, but it made me spend an extra hour or two holding in shift and W to run around the mountainsides, which was a little tedious.\nThe good:\nProbably the best visuals I've ever seen from Unreal Engine 3 (if this is just 3, maybe tailored?), potentially alongside Mirror's Edge.  In fact, thanks to the awesome textures and great color adjustments as you walk from area to area (color grading?), I feel like this is a pretty awesome game visually, from ANY engine.\nGoing hand in hand with the nice textures, this game has awesome visual design.  The landscape, the shore lines, the skies, the vistas ("Oh lol, that's just a static background, no way I can walk down there........wait a minute, I -am- down there now."), the muted colors, the balance of how everything fits together.  It's outstanding.\nI'm bad with directions so I ran in circles a lot, but the developers did a great job creating a huge, seamless, no loading environment.  It's not 10000 square miles or something, but it's a big area and things fit together pretty nicely.  I think they successfully realized a vision of creating a valley for you explore with some degree of freedom.\nThe story is strange but very creative in parts.\nPerformance is pretty great for me.  4.2 GHz i5 3570K, 8GB RAM, GTX 770 2GB.  Everything on max besides 4xAA, I got 60 fps and smooth operation (camera smoothing turned off) a lot of the time.  I didn't notice regular stuttering, but I guess because of map streaming, since I don't have a SSD, there was occasional hitching when running long distances.  There was one underground area where I got 35 fps or so because of some effects, and one house with special effects that might have brought me to 40 fps briefly (same with the hold-mouse-down effect).  Outside of those few special effect areas, things stayed smooth and looked great the majority of the time.\nThe developers made some player-friendly choices since you have to walk/run so much.  There's no run toggle, unfortunately, but running does NOT give any nauseating headbob, and you do NOT get out of breath and make annoying loud breathing sounds.  Hooray!\nThe soundtrack is appropriately creepy in parts, and the main mysterious theme is great.\nThe atmosphere is great.  I hate scary games and this game feels fairly near the limit of scary I can or want to deal with.  However, the atmosphere for the most part just involves tension or creepy things, with few jump scares and no combat.\nThe puzzles and interactive story segments are relatively simple, but work well with the story.  One note is that you should rebind the text toggle key to something other than spacebar so you don't have text showing up on top of a story segment.  Tab works fine.\n\nIf you're only mildly interested, $10 might be a reasonable price for you but even then I'd say it's still worth closer to $10 than $5 side because of all the positives.  It looks great, it's polished, and it runs stable.  I have seen a couple of mentions of event bugs, so I don't know if I was just lucky, especially with a certain underground sequence, but I hope everyone managed to finish.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game.  If you like point and click adventures, detective stories, or really pretty games you can screenshot, and you don't mind a 3-hour story, go ahead, I'd say it's worth $20.","September 26, 2014","true","5.7"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

It’s the best looking game, and the way it tells the story is inventive.\n\nOnly the audio has glaring faults. Like they didn’t fence off the sound zones properly. Sometimes sound and music will stop at the edges of the map. Near buildings it’ll sound as if you’re inside, even though you’re not. And similarly when you’re inside it can sound as if you’re outside when you step near certain walls. The script and acting can sometimes also sound just a bit off. Like it needed another pass in editing, and another take in the recording booth. Also in the end credits they only have music for half the credit roll, so you end up staring at scrolling names in dead silence. There’s just a layer of polish missing on the sound front.\n\nApart from that it does what it sets out to do very well. Some of the puzzles require you to use your brain, and feel fun to solve. Others are the 3d equivalent to pixel hunting, but take place within clearly defined borders so you don’t go crazy searching for the clues. And boy does it look good. Might be worth it for that alone. Most importantly though the story has a good payoff. It’s a mystery with supernatural elements, and those often tend to fall flat in the end when the veil is lifted. This doesn’t.","October 4, 2014","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I had been looking forward to playing it for some time, and while I enjoyed it, I didn't find it as good as I'd expected.  I'll give it a "recommend", but it's borderline for me.\n\nPositives:\n+ Excellent graphics/visuals and sound effects - I took multiple screenshots of the environment just because it was so impressive\n+ Easy Controls\n+ Story is fairly interesting and doesn't drag on\n+ Most of the puzzles are simple and don't distract from the story\n\nNegatives:\n- Game optimization - the game lags in several places, and there are strange "blinking light" artifacts that seem to occur on Radeon cards.\n- A little more instruction at the beginning would be nice - while free roaming is a positive, I missed one part of the first puzzle and didn't realize it until I was already in the third "area".  Having to run all the way back to the start was somewhat annoying.\n- One of the puzzles towards the middle of the game was rather frustrating, not in the "hard to figure out" way, but in that for some reason after completing it correctly, it didn't register, and I had to start all over from the beginning.\n\nOther:\n1. The game is fairly short.  I finished it in about 4 hours.\n\n2.  This is the first game I've ever played that gave me a "vertigo/nausea" feeling while playing. There's a thread about it in the forums, so it wasn't isolated to only me.  There are some suggestions in the forum thread for settings changes to reduce this, but I didn't find them until after I'd finished the game, so I don't know how well they'd work.  I 'm not going to penalize the game for this, but just wanted to mention it, and the developer might consider defaulting to the recommended settings for that if it's a widespread issue.\n\nComments:\nA hesitant recommendation.  The graphics and atmosphere alone are worth experiencing.  I found the story about average, maybe slightly above. The puzzles ranged from enjoyable to frustrating, and the game is relatively short, with some optimization issues.  I'd suggest waiting on a sale if you're interested in playing it.\n\nOverall Rating: 6/10","December 22, 2014","true","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

My computer only has 4GB of ram, so the game paged memory to disc pretty aggressively, but it settled down once I got to the next area.

Penny.\n\nBefore I continue, I see the review section for TVoEC primarily loaded with the question of "is it or isn't it worth $20?"  I consider it an ugly trend in gaming to place too much emphasis on value vs time.  If you must place a monetary value on a game, let it rest on your experience and not how long it to you to get there.  If you enjoy a 90 minute film, it's not crazy to spend $20 to buy and own in on DVD or Blu Ray.  The same should be said for gaming.  If you find that in your own opinion, a game is a work of art and you truly enjoyed it, then you should have no qualms about how much you paid for it.\n\nThat said, In my opinion The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a work of art.  This is a game about stories, how they're told and the entire package is quite brilliant.  I'll save writing a wordier review because this game doesn't need someone else to explain why you need to play it.  Just know that you should.  If you're like me, it's going to stick with you for awhile.\n\nPros:\n+Presentation.  This is hands down, one of the best looking games I've ever seen.\n+Story.  It wasn't until it was over that I realized just how good it was.\n+Characters.  I actually cared.  That's all that mattered.\n+Gameplay/Sound Design/Atmosphere.  All present and a solid foundation for the above.\n\nCons\n-The save system.  It's not broken and it's not terrible.  It should however be explained the the audience before playing.  The game saves upon completion of a puzzle.  There's no icon.  There's no warning.  When you continue your game you will standing where ever you were on the map when you completed your last  puzzle.  This can be initially frustrating.  If you're in the middle of a puzzle (some are long form) and you need to stop...this means your work will be undone and you will have to take another scenic hike to get back to where you were.  If you have a decent memory, it's fairly simple to retrace your steps quickly when you come back, but it is a hassle.","March 15, 2015","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a fantastic game that takes the gorgeous "walking simulator" foundation of Dear Esther and layers on some genuine detective gameplay, an unsettling, deeply engaging story, quietly perfect music, and some of the most gorgeous visuals I've ever witnessed in a game.\n\nEthan Carter is frequently near-photorealistic, and only "near" because there's a gauzy sense of nostalgia and sadness coloring everything you see that sets it just above and to the side of reality. Everything is both tangibly real yet ethereal and dreamlike, which is the perfect atmosphere for a story like this.\n\nYou play a paranormal detective, sent to an island to uncover the titular mystery of what happened to Ethan and his family. Think more Twin Peaks than CSI and you're on the right path. This story is both wrenching and wonderful in very different ways. I'll avoid spoilers and simply say that your head will be swimming in myth, terror, and awe in a truly cosmic manner by the time you reach the conclusion. It's far more than a murder mystery, is what I'm saying.\n\nThis game is for anyone who enjoys exploration, storytelling, atmosphere, and puzzle solving. There are no action scenes or QTEs, but it will definitely tax your curiosity and problem solving skills at just the right mixture.

I had been looking forward to playing it for some time, and while I enjoyed it, I didn't find it as good as I'd expected.  I'll give it a "recommend", but it's borderline for me.\n\nPositives:\n+ Excellent graphics/visuals and sound effects - I took multiple screenshots of the environment just because it was so impressive\n+ Easy Controls\n+ Story is fairly interesting and doesn't drag on\n+ Most of the puzzles are simple and don't distract from the story\n\nNegatives:\n- Game optimization - the game lags in several places, and there are strange "blinking light" artifacts that seem to occur on Radeon cards.\n- A little more instruction at the beginning would be nice - while free roaming is a positive, I missed one part of the first puzzle and didn't realize it until I was already in the third "area".  Having to run all the way back to the start was somewhat annoying.\n- One of the puzzles towards the middle of the game was rather frustrating, not in the "hard to figure out" way, but in that for some reason after completing it correctly, it didn't register, and I had to start all over from the beginning.\n\nOther:\n1. The game is fairly short.  I finished it in about 4 hours.\n\n2.  This is the first game I've ever played that gave me a "vertigo/nausea" feeling while playing. There's a thread about it in the forums, so it wasn't isolated to only me.  There are some suggestions in the forum thread for settings changes to reduce this, but I didn't find them until after I'd finished the game, so I don't know how well they'd work.  I 'm not going to penalize the game for this, but just wanted to mention it, and the developer might consider defaulting to the recommended settings for that if it's a widespread issue.\n\nComments:\nA hesitant recommendation.  The graphics and atmosphere alone are worth experiencing.  I found the story about average, maybe slightly above. The puzzles ranged from enjoyable to frustrating, and the game is relatively short, with some optimization issues.  I'd suggest waiting on a sale if you're interested in playing it.\n\nOverall Rating: 6/10","December 22, 2014","true","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has a wonderful sense of atmosphere: beautiful environments, lovely music, and a mystery to drive you forward.  The story was smaller in scope than I originally thought, but I liked it.\n\nThe puzzles were not hard, but they were interesting enough to give me a sense that I was solving the mystery, and I genuinely enjoyed how their investigation system would bring up multiple observations and new questions, rather than just stating observable facts.\n\nMy only complaints were some bad framerate when transitioning between areas and some unnecessary backtrack at the end.  My computer only has 4GB of ram, so the game paged memory to disc pretty aggressively, but it settled down once I got to the next area.  The backtracking was not required by the game design, but rather me not knowing where to go after one particular cause-and-effect puzzle.","January 2, 2015","true","5.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game additionally is sort of experimental, where some in-game graphic elements are achieved through very high quaility (in terms of detail) photography, which overall makes this game the best looking one I have played so far. In several spots in the game I ended up wandering around the scene and looking for a perfect composition for a screenshot (landscape photography instincts kicked in).\n\nThe game is not hard, the puzzles are average in difficulty, but there aren't many of them: approximately 30% of the game. The rest of the gameplay is exploration, which is very rewarding because of fantastic visuals. The story is mysterious and dark, but for me was a bit confusing. Gameplay is otherwise based on detective style. The soundtrack is beautiful ambient stuff, and brought back the feeling of wandering around the mountains in Skyrim.\n\nOverall a very impressive game: strange, weird, dark, amazingly beautiful, with a fantastic atmosphere.

LA Noire and Murdered: Soul Suspect both failed to give the player this feeling, but The Vanishing of Ethan Carter IMO manages to nail it. The "crime scene chronology" mechanic is fantastic, elegant yet requires the use of your brain to make inferences from the clues. Having to return the scene of the crime back to how it was when the deceased was killed is also a nice touch and makes sense for a "psychic detective."\n\nThe graphics are frankly gorgeous, although unfortunately the performance isn't as stable as it should be.\n\nThe plot is good (although the ending can feel like a bit of an M. Night Shyamalan cop-out-twist-bordering-on-a-deus-ex-machina), the music is very appropriate and fitting, and I enjoyed my time with the game.\n\nThe big drawback is the game's length; it can easily be finished in less than four hours.\n\nI'd advise buying the game if you love horror games, adventure/mystery/puzzle games, or just deeply atmospheric games in general. However, you may want to wait for a sale.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics for the investigation scenes, however, are excellent, and I hope The Astronauts is planning to make more games like this... if this game is intended as a "proof of concept" for their idea of how to make a detective game, then I'd say they've proven their concept with flying colors.\n\nPROS:\n+ Best investigation mechanics I've yet encountered in a detective game\n+ Atmospheric\n+ Incredible graphics\n\nCONS:\n- Brief\n- Uneven graphical performance\n\nOverall: Fans of horror and/or adventure games should certainly consider purchasing this game.","October 11, 2014","true","6.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Penny.\n\nBefore I continue, I see the review section for TVoEC primarily loaded with the question of "is it or isn't it worth $20?"  I consider it an ugly trend in gaming to place too much emphasis on value vs time.  If you must place a monetary value on a game, let it rest on your experience and not how long it to you to get there.  If you enjoy a 90 minute film, it's not crazy to spend $20 to buy and own in on DVD or Blu Ray.  The same should be said for gaming.  If you find that in your own opinion, a game is a work of art and you truly enjoyed it, then you should have no qualms about how much you paid for it.\n\nThat said, In my opinion The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a work of art.  This is a game about stories, how they're told and the entire package is quite brilliant.  I'll save writing a wordier review because this game doesn't need someone else to explain why you need to play it.  Just know that you should.  If you're like me, it's going to stick with you for awhile.\n\nPros:\n+Presentation.  This is hands down, one of the best looking games I've ever seen.\n+Story.  It wasn't until it was over that I realized just how good it was.\n+Characters.  I actually cared.  That's all that mattered.\n+Gameplay/Sound Design/Atmosphere.  All present and a solid foundation for the above.\n\nCons\n-The save system.  It's not broken and it's not terrible.  It should however be explained the the audience before playing.  The game saves upon completion of a puzzle.  There's no icon.  There's no warning.  When you continue your game you will standing where ever you were on the map when you completed your last  puzzle.  This can be initially frustrating.  If you're in the middle of a puzzle (some are long form) and you need to stop...this means your work will be undone and you will have to take another scenic hike to get back to where you were.  If you have a decent memory, it's fairly simple to retrace your steps quickly when you come back, but it is a hassle.","March 15, 2015","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a fantastic game that takes the gorgeous "walking simulator" foundation of Dear Esther and layers on some genuine detective gameplay, an unsettling, deeply engaging story, quietly perfect music, and some of the most gorgeous visuals I've ever witnessed in a game.\n\nEthan Carter is frequently near-photorealistic, and only "near" because there's a gauzy sense of nostalgia and sadness coloring everything you see that sets it just above and to the side of reality. Everything is both tangibly real yet ethereal and dreamlike, which is the perfect atmosphere for a story like this.\n\nYou play a paranormal detective, sent to an island to uncover the titular mystery of what happened to Ethan and his family. Think more Twin Peaks than CSI and you're on the right path. This story is both wrenching and wonderful in very different ways. I'll avoid spoilers and simply say that your head will be swimming in myth, terror, and awe in a truly cosmic manner by the time you reach the conclusion. It's far more than a murder mystery, is what I'm saying.\n\nThis game is for anyone who enjoys exploration, storytelling, atmosphere, and puzzle solving. There are no action scenes or QTEs, but it will definitely tax your curiosity and problem solving skills at just the right mixture.

For $20, I highly recommend it.\n\nThoughts:\n\nFor those wondering why I only have .4 hours logged, I have played and beaten it through, other means (make of that what you will) and after beating it, I went and bought it - this game was a no brainer assuming you have the money.\n\nIt seems The Astronauts know that regardless of how good a game is, if the game is only a little over 10 hours, you don't charge $50 or $60, I highly respect this since it shows they know and respect their audience.  I will be watching their next title with anticipation.","May 15, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Qualbert/recommended/258520/","Qualbert","Qualbert","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Qualbert/","671 products in account","I recently started and finished The Vanishing of Ethan Carter in a single sitting, and was thoroughly impressed the entire 4.2 hours it took me to fully complete the game.\n\nAlthough very short (and possibly too short for the full price of the game), TVoEC offers a simplistic yet incredibly engaging game. Taking inspiration from early 20th century weird fiction (namely H.P. Lovecraft, as expected), the story revolves around a private eye on a mission in an isolated village to help one "Ethan Carter". While playing through the opening segment, it seemed quite similar to Dark Corners of the Earth (also available on Steam, but broken as all hell) - being dumped in a disturbing setting with next to no guidance, only to figure everything out for yourself. This minimalist style of gameplay definitely works in the game's favour, as it seems to allow for a more immersive experience. There is no HUD, health bars, maps or quest icons. You have the WASD keys, the mouse, and your own two feet.\n\nGameplay revolves around solving various puzzles, and entering the minds of those deceased to see memories shortly before their deaths. It feels slightly cliche, but isn't too over-the-top like you might expect. The game's story is unravelled through these various puzzle sequences, as you explore the village in which the game is set, learning of the characters and their relationships with one another. It's definitely not an in-depth story, but it is very engaging.\n\nWhere TVoEC really shines is in its atmosphere. From the very first minute of the game, the atmosphere of this game almost smacks you in the face with how incredibly immersive it is. The stunning environments, beautifully-composed soundtrack and occasional narration from the main character provide an incredible feeling of isolation as you make your way through an empty and run-down village. It's almost unlike any game I've ever played, and has to be played to fully understand.\n\nI picked the game up off the Humble Store for $6.66 (coincidence?) and felt very satisfied with my purchase. For the RRP of $19.99 it may seem like a bit much for a game that can be finished in a few hours, but for anything ~$10 or less it's definitely a must-have for fans of mystery, horror, and weird fiction.","May 10, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So treacherous and rewarding and beautiful. So poetic and dark and impressive.\n\nThis game captivated me.\n\nWithing moments of starting the game I was greeted by a world that felt more alive than any other game I had ever seen. The nature around me seemed to breathe, and the tracks of an abandoned railroad sat, waiting for me to venture to whatever lay at the end.\n\nBasically, I was smacked in the face with a load a' good stuff.\n\nRight off the bat, you are greeted with amazing visuals that blow most games out of the water, wonderful sound design, some mysterious commentary from the narrator (and character you play as) Paul Prospero, and a very bloody dead body on some railroad tracks.\n\nThe game introduces some unique gameplay aspects and a disclaimer telling you that it will not hold your hand throughout the mysteries you come across. TVEC stays true to this promise, and as you roam around the dilapidated setting to different locations, you will find that you are only left with your wits- and a nifty power to visualize the memories of dead people once their murder scenes are set up properly.\n\n\nPros:\n-Astounding graphics, especially for an independant developer\n-Gripping, dark story with a Lovecraftian style and a wonderful twist\n-Brilliant gameplay. Many well implemented mystery-scene styled features\n-Extremely immersive\n\nCons:\n-The models and lip syncing on the characters are a bit stiff, but that doesn't distract too much from the gameplay\n-Very short game, only about 5-6 hours of gameplay (unless you're slow like me)\n-Some may experience graphical errors (mainly bright red, small, flashing dots in trees) depending on their hardware (the dots were very infrequent for me and did not distract too much, inconvenient nontheless)\n\nThe Spooky Pizza's Rating: 9/10\n\ntl;dr- The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a game that will astound you, from its brilliant aesthetics to its mysterious storyline to its engaging gameplay.

This time, he has arravied in Red Creek Valley after receiving a letter from Ethan Carter, inspiring him to journey there. Once he arrives tho, he knows that this is a dark place, filled with secrets and mysteries.\n\nStory wise, this game has many tie-ins and symbolisms. Making you really think about the story as you progress and also way after you have beat the game. The way the story is told, makes you intrigued and interested in what will unfold as you progress. The caracthers are diverse and well done, in terms of voice acting and the way they act in general. They feel real and adds several layers to the story. I mentioned that there are also some symoblism in the story. They add these to represent the caracthers throughout the story, that are really neat and well done in that sense that it describes them, symbolically. Which makes you think just how well designed the caracthers and this story is.\n\nThis game had me at a very eerie tone for a good portion of the game time, which is great when they can pull something like that off. The lonliness, the darkness and the sadness, it was all just overflowing in the way the music and the noises were done. Making this a headphone-worthy experience, to say the least.\n\nBut, does this game have good graphics? For a good amount of the gametime, I found myself on several occasions just screenshotting the sheer beauty of the landscapes. Every detail is well designed  and often breath-taking. There are also NO bugs of whatsoever that I encountered. They maximise the looks of this game to the fullest and it runs pretty damn smoothly. Maybe a lagspike here or there. But who cares, it is not exactly an abselute need for this game to have a perfect framerate. This game is not fast pace, you do not need to have a perfect framerate all the time, though it would add to a better experience with the game I guess.. Oh well.\n\nWhen it comes to the music, there are mainly two aspects of it. Sadness and darkness, this helps add the tone to the overall experience. Which is something I cannot describe by words, take my word for it when I say: Mikolai Stroinski is a wonderful composer. Take  a listen to Ethan's theme and you will see just how amazing the music in this game can get.\n\nGameplay-wise there are mainly the "search for clues" type of gameplay alongside the "complete the puzzle yourself". This brings me to the next point. You do not get a lot of help in this game, however the gameworld is not extremly big, so this is not that much of an issue. The game also features some horror elements and also 1 horror like sequence (depending on what you refer to as "horror"). I wont lie tho, that sequence scared the ♥♥♥♥ outta me.. But the gameplay is nicely done alongside the story and it is at times very creative.\n\nAnd the twist? Well I will not spoil it, but I will say this: You are not prepared...\n\nIn the end, this was an abselute blast of an experience! I loved every single moment of it, from the well done story to the fantasticly well composed music to the eerie tone throughout the game. The flaws in this game: none. Well there is one tho.. It ends.\n\n10 outta of ♥♥♥♥ing 10\n\n"One of the best experiences I've ever had in a game"","September 13, 2015","true","5.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The atmosphere is thick and the journey is stunning, but the ending lulls the plot to sleep with an anti-climactic whisper. Or at least, that's how I felt initially. The final scene is something nefarious as it serves to both surprise and confuse the player, raising more questions (amidst a sea of questions) rather than answering some. But the beauty of the ending comes not from what it explains to you, but from what you interpret from it.\n\nAt first, The Vanishing left me with a disappointed feeling--a feeling of, "That's it?" And if I had simply walked away and given it no more thought, I would have left without giving the game its proper credit; I would have left without knowing that this was one of the most dark, relatable tales I'd ever experienced. So if you do end up picking up this game, which I highly recommend, do yourself a favor and discuss theories with others after you've seen the game's end. It didn't resonate with me until I looked at other players' analyses, but afterwards, this became a game that struck close to my heart.\n\n\nRather aptly, The Vanishing opens with a disclaimer: "This game is a narrative experience that does not hold your hand". That statement applies to both the gameplay as well as the plot. The developers even made a blog post concerning the ending of the story, which gives some insight into their thought process. I'll link it below, but the short of it is: the devs don't intend to give you any of the answers. Rather, they want you to piece together your own interpretation--one that will stick with you for years after you've concluded their story. As they put it, "There is an ending to The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. But it’s your ending, not ours."\n\n\nhttp://www.theastronauts.com/2014/10/vanishing-ethan-carters-ending-extreme-spoilers/","March 13, 2015","true","5.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When a word comes up multiple times like a floaty question, slowly look around until all the words overlap to form a single word. It will then flash you into a "scene" that shows what you're looking for and it will be in that direction. If you do not do this, the item won't appear. I walked past a crank like 7 times without it highlighting because I didn't know about this mechanic. Don't even ask me about the rock. Afterwards, it's actually pretty cool and makes you feel a little more psychic (plus you can actually play the game the way it's meant without giving up or resorting to walkthroughs).\n\n2. You have an inventory. It doesn't come up. You can't call it up. Things are just pocketed and then pop out when you need them to do something. Therefore you can forget what you're carrying. But don't worry, #3. will help with that.\n\n3. When you leave a mystery area, the thing resets if you didn't complete it. That means things go out of your hidden inventory and back on the ground if you picked something up. Portals come back to their original state, etc. So if you want to start the little area over, leave and come back.\n\n4. Holding Shift while you move makes you run. Holding Ctrl while you move makes you crouch.\n\nI'm sure there's more. I've only been playing a couple of hours and was totally confused and broke down to see a bit of a walkthrough and realized these mechanics. Back I go to trying it without, because I like the challenge and actually role playing as a detective rather than walking through. Sounds like this game is short with the walk through so the time to figure it out will give me value in the game and satisfaction of "solving the dissapearance"\n\nIf anything else weird pops up that is a mechanic instead of a story piece, I'll post it here.","May 9, 2015","true","9.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is a captivating, if brief experience that immerses you in a gorgeous world as you attempt to uncover its dark secrets.\n\nFirst off, the game’s strengths:\n\nThe WorldThis game holds some of the best environment visuals I have ever seen. On my journey from plot point to plot point, I would often explore around for no other reason than to take in the views and enjoy the love and care the developers put into every detail. However, the game was very demanding on my computer's resources. On my quad-core i5 with 16GB RAM and Nvidia GTX 680, the game was all but unplayable on high settings due to framerate stutters. With some tweaking, I was able to reasonable smoothness but the framerate still chugged from time to time.\n\nThe PuzzlesWhile most point-and-click game puzzles are simply a matter of finding an item X and combining it with location Y to proceed, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter introduces a refreshing take on these mechanics. Most puzzles consist stumbling across a potential crime scene, restoring the scene to its original state, and then deducing the chain of events that led to that outcome. The game offers only a bare minimum amount of hints and does not give the player any instruction on the mechanics of a puzzle or the expected outcome. While this may be a negative for some players, I found I enjoyed solving the puzzles more, as I had to rely only on my reasoning and observations.\n\nThe AtmosphereI would not label this game as being a horror title per-se - there is only one jump scare to be found in the game (which is legitimately terrifying!) - but throughout my playthrough, I was surrounded by a constant feeling of dread and suspense. Walking through the game's seemingly abandoned rural setting evoked a great feeling of loneliness and mystery which, when combined with the game's superb score and dark supernatural themes, left me constantly expecting something terrifying to jump out at me or attack me.\n\n\nAnd now, some things you might not like:\n\nThe WalkingThe game provides you with no guidance on what you are supposed to do or where you are supposed to go and places you in a fairly large open world where it can be easy to miss certain puzzles entirely. Indeed, I missed two or three of the first puzzles entirely and had to backtrack to complete them later. This can be frustrating and time consuming, especially considering the game's minimalistic HUD does not include a map. Fortunately, the game features a sprint option and does include a map/fast-travel system in one section of the game that allows you to jump to any puzzles you might have missed. The game's beautiful environment also helps make this trekking more bearable/enjoyable.\n\nThe EndingI found the majority of the game to be very intriguing. The fact that the player knows nothing about the events they are uncovering or even who they are or why they are there really drives the story and draws the player in. However, I found the game's ending to be rather predictable (I saw it coming about halfway through the game) and felt that the twist it tries to pull somewhat falls flat.\n\nCharacter ModelsThe few characters you see in The Vanishing of Ethan carter appear to be slightly stylized or are, at least, less-detailed/realistic than the rest of the game. This causes their visual appearance to jar with the heavily detailed environment. However, this is a pretty minor nitpick and is easily overlooked.\n\n\nIf you are looking for an atmospheric, narrative experience you can complete in an afternoon or are a fan of mystery, puzzle, or point-and-click adventure games, this title is definitely worth your attention. I enjoyed my playthrough a lot and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. If you are looking for a longer title with more of a focus on dialog or action or are a gamer with a less-powerful rig, this may not be the game for you.","December 9, 2014","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I haven't played the redux yet, but it comes packed in with the original game for new and past purchasers, which is a very nice move on the developer's part.\n\nWith some of the most impressively detailed environments around, the sheer attention to detail alone is astounding. I'd almost recommend this one just for the enjoyment of wandering around looking at stuff, and I'm not the sort who usually cares about graphics. Realistic backgrounds meet strange fantasy elements to make for a very distinct look and feel to things. It really is like playing a dream sometimes.\n\nBut prettiness aside, there is also a mystery to be solved here. It's quite a dark one, involving murder, cults, and other things I won't spoil. It all wraps up in a way I found a little unsatisfying, but it's still a compelling narrative to follow. Which is good, because narrative is all he game really has going for it in terms of game stuff. Exploring, some fairly simple puzzle solving, and piecing together the storyline is all there is to keep you busy in the fairly short playtime, but this one's much more compelling than the usual narrative-only games, with some wonderful twists and surprises in store for you as you explore. Not for anyone who wants action, but great at what it sets out to do.","September 18, 2015","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This time, he has arravied in Red Creek Valley after receiving a letter from Ethan Carter, inspiring him to journey there. Once he arrives tho, he knows that this is a dark place, filled with secrets and mysteries.\n\nStory wise, this game has many tie-ins and symbolisms. Making you really think about the story as you progress and also way after you have beat the game. The way the story is told, makes you intrigued and interested in what will unfold as you progress. The caracthers are diverse and well done, in terms of voice acting and the way they act in general. They feel real and adds several layers to the story. I mentioned that there are also some symoblism in the story. They add these to represent the caracthers throughout the story, that are really neat and well done in that sense that it describes them, symbolically. Which makes you think just how well designed the caracthers and this story is.\n\nThis game had me at a very eerie tone for a good portion of the game time, which is great when they can pull something like that off. The lonliness, the darkness and the sadness, it was all just overflowing in the way the music and the noises were done. Making this a headphone-worthy experience, to say the least.\n\nBut, does this game have good graphics? For a good amount of the gametime, I found myself on several occasions just screenshotting the sheer beauty of the landscapes. Every detail is well designed  and often breath-taking. There are also NO bugs of whatsoever that I encountered. They maximise the looks of this game to the fullest and it runs pretty damn smoothly. Maybe a lagspike here or there. But who cares, it is not exactly an abselute need for this game to have a perfect framerate. This game is not fast pace, you do not need to have a perfect framerate all the time, though it would add to a better experience with the game I guess.. Oh well.\n\nWhen it comes to the music, there are mainly two aspects of it. Sadness and darkness, this helps add the tone to the overall experience. Which is something I cannot describe by words, take my word for it when I say: Mikolai Stroinski is a wonderful composer. Take  a listen to Ethan's theme and you will see just how amazing the music in this game can get.\n\nGameplay-wise there are mainly the "search for clues" type of gameplay alongside the "complete the puzzle yourself". This brings me to the next point. You do not get a lot of help in this game, however the gameworld is not extremly big, so this is not that much of an issue. The game also features some horror elements and also 1 horror like sequence (depending on what you refer to as "horror"). I wont lie tho, that sequence scared the ♥♥♥♥ outta me.. But the gameplay is nicely done alongside the story and it is at times very creative.\n\nAnd the twist? Well I will not spoil it, but I will say this: You are not prepared...\n\nIn the end, this was an abselute blast of an experience! I loved every single moment of it, from the well done story to the fantasticly well composed music to the eerie tone throughout the game. The flaws in this game: none. Well there is one tho.. It ends.\n\n10 outta of ♥♥♥♥ing 10\n\n"One of the best experiences I've ever had in a game"","September 13, 2015","true","5.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You really have to play the game slowly to get the most out of it. (loud headphones and a dark room are helpful, too)\n\nBut on to the actual game part. You play as a private detective, who has the ability to communicate with the dead to some degree. He comes to Red Creek Valley after the young boy Ethan Carter sends him a letter asking for help. The purpose of the game is to find out what happened in Red Creek Valley - a place with dark secrets, as you find out quickly. This is done by exploring the area (note here that the game isn't really openworld, but leaves enough room to wander around and explore), finding out the background to murders and solving (mostly easy) riddles. During all that the game does not give you any objectives, there isn't even a real HUD - "This game is a narrative experience that does not hold your hand" is a statement that pops up in the beginning of the game, and it is 100% accurate.

When a word comes up multiple times like a floaty question, slowly look around until all the words overlap to form a single word. It will then flash you into a "scene" that shows what you're looking for and it will be in that direction. If you do not do this, the item won't appear. I walked past a crank like 7 times without it highlighting because I didn't know about this mechanic. Don't even ask me about the rock. Afterwards, it's actually pretty cool and makes you feel a little more psychic (plus you can actually play the game the way it's meant without giving up or resorting to walkthroughs).\n\n2. You have an inventory. It doesn't come up. You can't call it up. Things are just pocketed and then pop out when you need them to do something. Therefore you can forget what you're carrying. But don't worry, #3. will help with that.\n\n3. When you leave a mystery area, the thing resets if you didn't complete it. That means things go out of your hidden inventory and back on the ground if you picked something up. Portals come back to their original state, etc. So if you want to start the little area over, leave and come back.\n\n4. Holding Shift while you move makes you run. Holding Ctrl while you move makes you crouch.\n\nI'm sure there's more. I've only been playing a couple of hours and was totally confused and broke down to see a bit of a walkthrough and realized these mechanics. Back I go to trying it without, because I like the challenge and actually role playing as a detective rather than walking through. Sounds like this game is short with the walk through so the time to figure it out will give me value in the game and satisfaction of "solving the dissapearance"\n\nIf anything else weird pops up that is a mechanic instead of a story piece, I'll post it here.","May 9, 2015","true","9.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I really don't know what else to say.  It is an adventure style game, a bit more in the vein of myst than the classic point and click.  The execution though, was flawless and I mean that quite literally.  Every single aspect of what has made games like myst such classics has been executed to utter perfection.\n\nThe graphics and sound are beyond immersive and pushing the boundries of what photo realism can achieve on current generation hardware.  The story is suble yet compelling.  The integration of puzzles is perfectly executed as a touch of surrealism that feels completely natural in this world of crumbling structures and abandoned buildings.\n\nNothing is explained to you, but everything felt completely natural.  I even managed to solve one of the puzzles before I actually got to the 'hint♥♥♥♥♥♥ence' area for it, simply by thinking and proceeding naturally based on the light/shadows/architecture and that was tremenduously satisfying.\n\nThe 'user interface' such as it is, is just simple text tracing the thoughts of your character.   Puzzles that would otherwise be potentially punitively frustrating, have built in systems to help you along in a totally natural feeling way... Can't find something? when the text gets a little blurry, look around until you can focus and you can find your way forwards, etc.\n\nIn the end though the main 'character' of the game is the world itself.  I could honestly just lose myself wandering through the paths and at times I felt like I already had.  I could swear I've seen bits and pieces of this world in my own life over the years and thats really utterly outstanding.\n\nNormally this is where I would reccomend it to fans of the genre or to people who like x or y.  Honestly though for something of this caliber, its appeal can transcend its genre completely.  Whoever you are, whatever you like, dim the lights, put this game on, and allow yourself to fall into its world and come out amazed.","December 21, 2014","true","11.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

This eerie view of our mundane world is also visible through the documents and newspaper clippings found throughout the valley, portraying an outside view of life in this rural neck of the woods.

I'm a big reader (and sometimes writer) of weird fiction and I was very excited when they said that it was going to be based around the works of people like Blackwood, Lovecraft and so on. Unfortunately the game itself didn't have a lot of dialogue, had a disjointed story due to the open world design (if you didn't do the puzzles in a very specific order and there were no indicators for that) and that story didn't have a lot of meat to it. And by that I mean it was barely there at all. The game felt empty in the worst possible way a game can feel empty and was very, very, short. The ambiant music didn't fit the theme of the game, but was nice.\n\nOn the upside? The developers clearly spent a lot of time making things look absolutely fantastic. If you've got a nice machine this game will make you feel like you're actually walking through the places you explore.

It visually impresses and ensnares with a rather unique take on telling a story in a game. If you don't mind a lot of walking, and maybe even backtracking depending on how you play, the game can be quite enjoyable.\n\nVisualsVisually the game is breath-taking and some screenshots don't really do it all the justice it deserves. From the very get go of the game you will be hit with beautifully encompasing vistas, forests and derelict towns.\nThe overal attention to design and look of enviroments in the game are really well thought out. You'll be able to feel every bit of tension or emotion emanating from everything from warm exteriors to dark ritualistic crypts.\n\nAudioAgain the game almost overwhelmingly impresses with the audio throughout. The musical score is fitting and flows beautifully between enviroments. Voice acting is also some of the best I've heard; it all sounds natural, clean and no dialog is wasted.\n\nStoryWithout going into any spoilers: go into this game expecting something different, but highly interesting. Your character is in this place looking for Ethan Carter and he's a detective, so it's natural for the story to follow a "piece it together" format.\nThe overal story is very morbid, this is made evident from the first few minutes (if not seconds) into the game. Throughout it is basically your job as the player to run around, or calmly meander, and piece together the overall happenings in this strange little valley  you've entered, by the use of your psychic powers.\nThis however can run against the games favour though, as it's rather core to the overal gameplay.\n\nGameplayFirst off, just know that many of  gameplay mechanics are actually intricately tied to its story, as that's the games main selling point, its' story.\nAt the start the game could feel a bit overwhelming, as there is truly no hand-holding, it's up to you to figure stuff out. The game does do a great job at giving you lots of opportunities around the start to get use to or introduce you to those mechanics, hightening the chance for you to actually get the idea around them.\nThere is a lot of walking, but I feel like the addition of actuall content in between segments gives it enough weight to not be considered just another walking simulator. Even dullish walking between segments can very often be broken apart by our detective giving some very well recorded exposition.\n\nThe, "no hand-holding," can be very frustrating though, as there can quite often be no clear indication on where you're suppose to be going, or more importantly, what you're actually suppose to be doing.\nIt could be inconsequencial, as there are only so many places you can actually walk around in.\nThe biggest issue is that if your unfortunate enough to miss certain "fragments" of the story on your way to the end, which is very possible, you will find yourself having to backtrack across the entire game world. This is actually a mechanic in game, as you will not be able to unlock the ending of the game (even if your standing awkwardly, literally right in front of it...staring at it) if you had missed any of the ethereal security-camera footage caches.\n\nThere are some horror elements to the game, but they definitely do not play an overwhelming role throughout. I would rate it more as a suspense/thriller. There are some puzzles, some running, but mostly just walking and thinking.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe game story is very gripping, interesting and something fairly fresh in the time it was released. It will capture your imagination and make you wonder about what truly happened in the place you're roaming around. There are elements from everything from the twisted forms of childrens imaginations to Lovecraftian horror and the repercussions that our actions may carry.\nThe gameplay is solid, with no bugs that I have experienced myself. The core gameplay will probably not appeal to everyone, it's a slow build up and in the simplest definition a puzzle game wrapped up in an amazing story, so don't buy this expecting a fast paced run through.\nOtherwise, this game will really be a decent addition to you're steam library.","May 30","true","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","EDIT (09/16/15): I felt the need to preface about the Redux version released. My current computer won't let me run the Unreal 4 Engine game on even the lowest possible settings. The original runs on Unreal 3. All achievements are the same, and the game has no gameplay alterations, so my review applies to both games.\n\nIf you care about what the differences are, visually, I recommend this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmSR2ySBl08\n\n\nTypically I am not interested in playing these "Walking Simulator" games. However, after trying this game on a friend's computer for about thirty minutes, I decided to buy the game myself. I will avoid narrative spoilers--aside from a comment on these types of games' take on stories--yet I will give a starter's guide for getting around some annoyances of the beginning part of the game (and a certain achievement).\n\nWalk. Explore. Think. The name of the game.\nThat's the gist of the gameplay. I think out of all the games trying to attempt this format (i.e. any Chinese Room game), this game is almost perfect with its execution. Mostly because the game has some few challenging puzzles and gameplay changes to keep things interesting.\n\nThe narrative is not given to you; it's rewarded for exploring and solving puzzles. More importantly, there is a cohesive feel to the story that you can follow, even out of order. Even though you will most likely play out certain events in a linear manner, there is enough player-choice involved to make the experience feel like a geninune mystery.\n\nBesides walking, you, a supernatural investigator, have the ability to piece together clues by setting up the situation as before and watching them unfold. There's even a part of the game where you have to play out events in a specific order inorder to get the straight story. (Similar to Murdered: Soul Suspect, except without the unnecessary stealth). This puzzle--as well as the final puzzle of the game--are the weakest aspects, in terms of gameplay, but the paranormal ability really does immerse you as the protagonist and it makes sense of certain strange things that unfold in the game.\n\nYou also have some basic puzzles that require you to wander the nearest area for clues. Sometimes everything will be located in the same room; other times,  the one thing you need is located somewhere else because, reasons. The game has one or two old adventure-game like issues of puzzle-pieces being hidden for the sake of artificial time-lengthening. But, thankfully, most of these puzzles are done right and they're logical without being too obvious.\n\nThe usual structure for this game is: Find new area, search for clues or solve the puzzle, then solve the paranormal investigation.\n\nAnd as you walk around the countryside of Red River, you'll have time to contemplate all the things you'll find along the way, hear little bits of conversation from the protagonist, and experience random stuff you didn't think would happen. The general room of thumb for knowing when it's safe to move on: If you have found the Ethan page or got the achievement, you can go somewhere else.\n\nThese Stories Need More Active Voice\nI'm going to make this brief. I get why this game is set-up the way it is and how the mystery is unfolded to the protagonist. But, please, can we have more stories that have us engaged or doing something with the actual plot? We can still discover things and explore without being detached from all the interesting bits of the stories.\n\nThis game gets a pass because it does something creative and comes up with some believable explanations for how you experience the story. I'm by no means calling this game's story original. I think it is a well-executed, neatly made game and story. As with most mystery-stuff, you quickly get diminishing returns (in this case the first hour and a half were the peak). The cliches too, even with the set-up of the game being by the books, never bothered me.\n\nAlthough, that ending--I both extremely hate the sucker-punch, but it makes sense. Perhaps too much sense for my tastes. But that's all I'll say about the story.\n\nStarter GuideYou'll get no tips, hints or indicators. Only notes.\nThe first two achievements/puzzles are the only tutorial of the mechanics. If you go past the blocked-off sign past the rail-car, go back and solve the two puzzles. They'll help you understand how to find clues, interact with objects and use the paranormal abilities. (You can always come back to the starting point at any time in the game.)\nIF YOU WANT TO SAVE YOUR GAME, then you need to find the nearest Ethan note. You can save at any note and that's where you'll start next-time. However, all your previous puzzles/items are undone/gone.\nYou don't need to beat the game in one sitting--but one achievement requires you to do all three parts in one sitting or it'll reset.\nBest experience is to play through this game for one evening sitting. It'll probably take you 3 to 5 hours. The difficulty is first understanding how you need to solve the game's puzzles.\nI think this game is a decent title that's worth your money. Perhaps on a 50% discount if you're not satisfied with the amount of content or if you're not sure if this game is worth your time. I think if people are willing to buy games like Stanley Parable, then I think TVEC is more than welcome in the marketplace.","September 8, 2015","true","5.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This is a heavy departure from the other games they have made.\n\nThe Vanishing of Ethan Carter puts you in the shoes of the paranormal detective Paul Prospero. Paul get's a letter from a boy named Ethan Carter who say's something strange is going on at Red Creek Valley and he urges Paul to come here. As soon as we show up we find out something is not right about this place and it's up to us to figure out what happened to Ethan Carter.\n\nGameplay is really simple. It's a walking simulator, but you actually have to figure out puzzles to figure out what happened to Ethan and his family. This goes from collecting clues to putting together a crime scene to play back a flashback and to find out how that crime was committed.\n\nThe soundtrack to this game is phenomenal and the sound effects are amazing too. This game just begs you to play with headphones on. It's a great soundtrack and it's worth purchasing on it's own.\n\nGraphics are absolutely phenomenal. When I first played the game I took some time away from the game just to look around the scenery, it's that good. If you want some nice looking screen savers than this game is surely for you.\n\nSome of the puzzles are insanely difficult as the game doesn't hold your hand from start to finish. It's all up to you to figure out the mystery of the Vanishing of Ethan Carter. You don't take any notes so it's up to you to remember everything you saw and read.\n\nThe game took me around 4 to finish and I found it just the right amount of time to complete this game.  Apart from that there's not much replay value. This game is a one time experience. Some of the crime scenes and the ending pack quite a punch and you won't get the same effect the second time through.\n\nI didn't encounter many problems. The only problem I had with the game is a micro stutter when I played through the mine section, but apart from that I encountered zero problems.\n\nNow this is one thing I wanted to address and that's the Ancient Gods puzzle in the mines. This is a spoiler for anyone who will want to play the game so I'll try to keep as less spoilery as possible. You have to find and inspect 4 dead bodies in the mines to get clues so you can open a door. There's a cursed miner that chases you through the entire section and he can kill you in one hit making you restart the entire thing all over again. It took me an entire hour just in that section which annoyed me the living hell out of me. But I guess that's just a rant and not a problem with the game.\n\nThe Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a phenomenal experience. I can't recommend the game enough. This game is a must own for any adventure game fan, detective fan and a mystery fan. This game is one of my favorite games of all time and is worth the full asking price. I give The Vanishing of Ethan Carter a 10/10","August 25, 2015","true","4.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Atmosphere, horror, a few jump scares. Very beautiful world (Unreal Engine 4) with nothing to do in it. Shockingly low on content and gameplay elements. Very short too. Background story is a crude horror/mystery tale about a family possessed by a ghost and killing each other, largely told through a narrator and letters strewn across the game world (lame excuse for lacking real content and interactivity).\n\nYour job is to reconstruct who killed who, and this is how it goes:\n\nYou run around and come across typical adventure items (a lamp, an axe, a dead body, etc.), but you cannot interact or do anything with them. All you have to do is find all items in a certain area, which automatically prompts a flashback scene with 5 story elements and you have to guess the sequence of events, like this: (1) he picked up the axe, (2) he talked to his brother, (3) he went over to the chapel, (4) he killed his uncle, (5) he talked to his mother. That's it. Then you head to the next area, find all its items, flashback pops up..... You do this guess-the-sequence thing for the fate of each family member.

The game is actually pretty short, only around 6 hours, but the story is excellent for being so short even if it’s just for the little secret stories that are hidden around the game.\n\nI hate scary games with a passion, I can’t play them by myself, just the “horror” tag will drive me away from games the majority of the time. There are a few jump scares in the game, mostly in the very beginning and the middle of the game. The game runs smoothly and has absolutely no glitches at all.\n\nWhen I was playing and I got to the middle of the game with the jump scare I streamed with someone that already got through the game and they walked me through it so I didn’t have to worry about getting trapped by the jump scare. So if you are worried about getting scared then read a few forums or maybe watch a YouTube video.\n\nPROS\n•Excellent story\n•Amazing graphics\n•Smooth gameplay\n\nCONS\n•The game is too short\n\nRATING\n8/10","February 8, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The music also plays big part in its beauty - it is a fitting theme for the unfolding setting and events.\n\nWriting is kept on first glance simple and short, but actually has enough depth and hidden nuances once you delve deeper into it and keep attention to the details. Also a second playthrough puts a lot of it into different pesrpective. Hell, even on the first playthrough you'll soon enough start looking at the things you read or hear in a different light.\n\nAnother thing I loved is - the game really doesn't hold your hand, or at least does it minimally. It leaves the setting, story and game-bits unfold in whatever order and pace you choose. But especially if you're the kind to leave no stone unturned - you'll get handsomely rewarded for that.\n\nThis game is a truly delightful and amazing experience, I really hope we'll soon see more like it (and similar experiments like Gone Home) breaking the mold.","February 9, 2015","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Incredibly original concept. Why cant all games look this good (and run flawlessly)? For being Mystery genre, with puzzle aspects, and full atmospheric immersion, its a total slam dunk in every category you can place it in. The devs of this game need to teach Techland how to create their map for Dying Light. (I know, I know, a city is mych different to render than a forest...dont leave stupid comments)\n\nOne thing that amazes me is that so many games are trying to stand out by being "open world". Yet, take a game like Ethan Carter, and you realize that you dont need an open world environment to be good. Thoughtful writing creatives a narrative. Situations are revealed through the narrative, supported by the visual environment, and you have the basis of immersion. Open world or not, if you cant do at least one of those things well in a fpd style game, then it sucks. Ethan Carter not only does the basics right, but it does everything right.\n\nI fully expected a game this beautiful to not run smoothly. OR I expected to have to turn the settings down. It runs smoother than any game I have yet played. And I can run it at default settings (which are high by default) or even tweak it all the way up on the few options that are set moderately, and it still runs just as smooth.\n\nSo far, I cant think of any area where this game falls short. It seems to excel in every category. And everywhere else it redefines quality and hopefully raises the bar for all other devs moving forward.\n\nIts easily a 10/10 - Buy it\n\nPS: Have I ever given a game a 10/10 before? And this isnt even my favorite type of game either","February 10, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, even if you like games that are action-packed and filled with nothing but cause and effect, taking some time to fall in love with this game will offer you a very rare and special singleplayer experience. Although many other games offer rich story and even more content, this game seems to succeed much more, for me, in capturing you in its Lovecraftian universe. Overall, I certainly reccomend you pick this up if you need a short break from traditional and more popular action based games. Its $20 price tag is well worth the wonderful experience, but you can often catch it on sale if you're low on Steam money. So if you're ready to spend about 4 or so hours to get caught up in the world of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, I reccomend it. Out of 10 I'd give it a solid 8.5, and hope you have just as much fun as I had with this game.","February 10, 2015","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are many enviromental lookout points, all of which I stopped at, the soak in the beautiful nature that this game shows.

The actual game is pretty easy, similar to Dear Ester, but better. This is more of an interactive story then a game. The graphics and scenery make it so everywhere you look there is an amazing view.

Ther's not much to hate about this game.\n\nMy only gripe is the games length. It only took me about 2 and a half hours to complete.  Now, It does a lot in this short time, tells the story it wants to and leaves it at that, and does a great job with it.\n\nHowever, I'm not certain it warrents the $20 price tag. Normally a game of this length you'll find for aroung $5-$10.\n\nDoes the outstanding quality of this game justify the higher price? Perhaps, I suppose that's up to the individual player. For me, I would have been much more satisfied with maybe a $15 price.\n\nPicing issues aside, This game is still worth getting, and you will find much to love about it.","October 18, 2014","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I saw the trailers I thought "Hmmm, what a lovely looking game" and that held true.  Graphically, this game is top notch.  However, it is a little discordant: although supposedly set in some small town (presumably) in the US, the architecture and landscape are quintessentially mid-east European (think eastern Austria, Czech. Republic etc. and you get the idea).\n\nThe gameplay itself is quite linear in a meandering sort of a way so you are free to do as you wish within limits; if you don't complete some tasks then others will not become available.  The puzzles are reasonably challenging without being blockers - a little bit of logic will get you a long way in this game.  The storyline is really what is making me waver.  OK, I know it's a supernatural, horror type thing but it isn't an "omg, what the heck just jumped outta the walls at me" frighty game - it's more HP Lovecraft: dark, foreboding and, at times, rather depressing.  I've never been a fan of HP Lovecraft.  I don't want to say much more than that otherwise it will spoil things.\n\nIn short, if you're a fan of old school adventure games, beautifully executed and with a reasonable level of challenge then you will most likely love this game.  Just don't expect to feel refreshed, invigorated and uplifted when you finish it :).","October 3, 2014","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you grew up and enjoyed those types of games as i did then prepare yourself for the future.\nFirstly, lets get the obvious out of the way, the world is absolutely gorgeous. Indoor, outdoor, lighting all looks amazing. When you see all the grass and trees moving in the wind it is very impressive. I could go on and on about the graphics, but thats just one feature.\nI really like how there is a small intro at the start and then it's where do you go, what do you want to do as you walk out of a tunnel. You play as Paul Prospero a pyschic detective who has shown up in the town of Red Rock to find a young fan who has dissappeared. The game is about exploration, and discovery. As you explore about you will come upon bodies who you will then try to piece together how they died. If you are a fan of Sherlock, its basically the same concept of finding the obvious and not so obvious clues and then placing events in chronological order and watching the crime unfold. Its a lot of fun, effective and the most important part, tells a cohesive story.\nWithout going into story spoliers, after you have completed the game i would suggest going to the deveopers discussion :http://www.theastronauts.com/2014/10/vanishing-ethan-carters-ending-extreme-spoilers/ Super interesting read and will help fill in some holes.\nMy only dissapointment in the game is the length. I would have liked a few more puzzles but sometimes that is not the answer. The value for me is in the experience and i can easily say it was worth the price of admission.\n\nPositives\nPushes point and click games forward\nGraphical powerhouse\nSolid story and satisfying ending\nThe musical score is amazing\nSlenderman type level in the mines\nComing out of detective vision back into the color of the world\nNo hand holding\n\nNegatives\nLength\nNot fully open world\nSound is minimal and charcter models look bad when you comapre to the amazing enviroments\nExploring off the path is not rewarding.

It is however beautiful, atmospheric, and quite interesting while it lasts. Some will call it a 'walking simulator' (as if that is inherently a term of derision), some will call it indie, but me, I'll just call it interesting.\n\nThe Breathtaking of...\nEthan Carter is an amazing looking game for such a small studio. Let's just make that clear up front. Basically every moment is a perfect screenshot or video waiting to happen - it's a gorgeously detailed world thanks to their photo-scanning technology. It's a little...austere though, with no wildlife to speak of, and encounters with humans are few and far between. As much as a few birds or butterflies would've enlivened the world though, you only really notice because everything else looks so damn good!\n\nThe Playing of...\nEthan Carter is more contemplation than action. For the most part you'll be walking around, taking in the aforementioned beauty, and occasionally solving some light puzzles. In fact there's really only one 'action sequence' in the whole game to my mind; a slightly ill-conceived horror/chase section that aims for tense but trends more toward annoying. Beyond that misstep though, this is a game to be played and enjoyed at your own pace over the course of 3-5 hours. It took me five, but that's because I was looking (craving!) more interactions, collectibles, puzzles or hidden moments than the game actually delivered.\n\nThe Summarising of...\nEthan Carter is a solid first effort, displaying impressive visuals and a deft hand at atmosphere from developers The Astronauts. It's biggest fault is really that there isn't more of it - it's a big, beautiful world filled with not very much. And while that's a shame, the discovering of Ethan Carter is well worth your time and money.","September 27, 2014","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gone Home, Dear Esther, Minervas Den) succeeds in creating a discovery-based story. Robert Frost's "The Road Not Taken" may best describe how the puzzles in this game are presented.\n\nThe world is beautiful and if you can run it at full resolution with ultra high details: do so. There were moments where I found myself just wandering and gazing at the landscape. It may still only be polygons and shaders, but the amount of detail found in just the juxtaposition of bare faced bedrock along against a subtle man-made pathways made me appreciate the craft of good CG modelling and level design. Things just felt right.\n\nThe Sound design is fantastic. I recommend playing with the music on, as it creates a great moody cinematic experience. Some may prefer only the ambience of the forest, but with a little tweaking, I found pushing the music back a couple notches and bringing the ambience up helped immensely with the immersion. Also, I recommend headphones with this experience.\n\nThere's so many moments in this game where I doubted the intentions of the storyteller, however, once I realized what I was witnessing, it only empowered my experience.\n\nNo doubt this is a game that for those who enjoyed Gone Home or Dear Esther should play.

If you're in to exploration games with a heavy linear detective stories this game is great. That being said thats what this game comes down to is eploring and being a supernatural detective. The story is good however i was very unsatisfied with the ending, for some reason the ending just didn't do it for me. I really wanted to like the ending since everything leading up to it grabbed my attention (ecluding parts where i had no idea where to go next and the game gives you very little to no direction). The game giving no direction however is something i found very interesting since a friend of mine was also playing through it our experiences were very different espicially since there are some things you could miss or skip over. I'm not sure if those have an effect on the ending or if everything needs to be completed to finish the game (I had already completed everything upon finishing the game) but it reminds me of the stanley parable where two people playing through the game can have tremendously different experiences.

TVEC is a first person story driven narrative with some puzzles tied into the game, you encounter strange things as you travel throughout the world and each of these 'strange things' contributes to an overall understanding to how an individual which resided within the town died. Without going into plot spoilers, I'll say that this game does have twists in a way and the story surprised me. While there aren't that many puzzles and it wont take you more than one seating to beat this game, I do still recommend this game for its 'walk through this town and learn its story' deal and it actually has puzzles and enjoyable gameplay. It's not that long but it's definitely better than Gone Home in my opinion, which I don't consider a game at all.\nYou'll slowly piece together the mystery of this town, and it will be one worth solving. Just don't expect to be replaying this after you've beaten it, as is the nature of a story driven first person game.\n\nExpected Gameplay w/o walkthrough: 6 Hours\nPros:\n- Puzzles are fun, rewarding and give you an understanding of what has happened to the town and its inhabitants.\n- The ambient noises coupled with the OST make for a really immersive experience.\n- The graphics don't look like terrible and I would say they are actually of AAA quality.\n- It actually has gameplay (which is usually the problem with these kinds of games, you kinda just walk through the world and do absolutely nothing as you hear a 2 hour speech).\n- The Atmosphere is INSANE!!!!\n- Lots of referential stuff to the 20th century, there's even a Lovecraft segment and a space-traveler segment among other things.\n(Sort of) Cons:\n- Game is quite short, but this isn't a large con, it's worth the money (if it was 80 dollars then it would be a problem).\n- The protagonist doesn't talk /that/ much, but this is accounted for by the dialogue exchanges between characters in the 'spirit' sequences where you piece together the mysteries of each section.\n\nGeneral information:\n- One difficulty setting\n- Saving is done through check-points, not manual so you must accomplish certain things before a save but that's alright because losing progress isn't losing progress at all, if you half solve a puzzle it's not tedious to go through the steps you've already done.\n- You may need a decent PC to run this at max settings, there's not a bit of this world that you can see, but can't reach. For the most part there's no like flat backgrounds, because most of the things you can see in the world are actually rendered. On an R9 270X 4GB card, 8GB RAM and a 4 core (3.8GHz) processor I ran this between 60-80 FPS. That being said, it's quite well optimised and I'm sure tweaking the settings to your liking will help with achieving the frame rate you want to. This kind of game can be played in 30 FPS and it will still be immersive.\nOverall Rating: 8.5/10","September 29, 2014","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

So ill first start out with my original thought of game pre purchase.  I like all sorts of games so long as they bring something to the table that intrigues me.  In this case i had watched the trailer and the gameplay videos on steam, and decided that this game had first off amazing visuals (not just graphically but landscape design was pretty great)  and a style of game play that just struck me as a refreshing change of pace to my growing stack of story driven/puzzle games.  I had discussed the gameplay to my friend, (as we went upon an expedition into the forest to chop trees for quickly arriving winter) then nothing. I guess along the journey I had expressed interest in the purchase of the game, but only whence my financial portfolio was performing better. Fast forward a time we are cutting more wood we arrive back at the casa and i have a steam message.  Turns out whilst i was preoccupied my friend had found time to purchase the game without me knowing, and left me a message  We should play the game upon its download and then something about drinking yada yada  twas a great message.\n\nGame installs we click play and the pre game window launches.  I enjoy when a game does this.  Not only does it remind me about changing the graphics settings, but makes the whole process much easier especially if the game is like Fable Anniversary and has the worst computer interface i have ever had the misfortune of dealing with.  After a few moments of turning everything to  maximum overdrive  it was finally time to play.  The Games Main Menu was very simple nice scenery of a meadow i believe now that i think about it i cant really remember, but i do remember a tree in the bottom left corner. There were four or so options we clicked new game or whatever it is to begin our adventure into saving some small child in a basement from his moth.... oh wait thats the  Binding of Isaac  .... to save a boy whom has vanished.\n\nThe game opens into an amazing graphically vivid environment.  Slight nuissance of blurring around the non focused center area of screen, but its an attempt to be more realistic i guess.  Controls are very simple which is good because there is no tutorial.  Straight into  Murder Train  mystery solving.  The solving of events is pretty simple; find dead guy, restore crime scene, and use dead guy's memories (I personally think that Paul Prospero is Dumbledore in disguise hence the use of pensieve) to discover a series of events that you must piece together to gain access to the dead spirits last major memory as its soul is torn from the world of the living.   BOOM  Solved my first scene psychic powers FTW.  Thus far into the game about 15 minutes or so, and the daunting question begins to arrive  "How long is this game?"  This question never popped into my mind before, but story driven games are notorious for being rather short. I personally am ok with a game thats a few hours of great story because hey its a genre with usually a better story than an fps, but without the  pchew pchew.   Although at this  point you are also wondering is there going to be a good storyline as well. All you know is  there is an entity named the  Sleeper  controlling people. Ethan is resistant to its call, and he is in trouble.\n\nThat is it for giveaways to the story and progress that takes place now its the moment everyones been waiting for.  My friend and i finished the game it roughly 2 hours and 30 minutes.  Thats full completion all miscellaneous events and all story driven ones.  The story had its share of depth, but id say most of the depth came from the miscellaneous events and tidbits of  Ethan's  stories.  Twice were we caught off guard by sudden bouts of quiet to super loud doubtfully intentional jump scares.... Ok maybe one was intentional, and it got us because here we are joking about  should we run..... no he disappeared OHHH SH** . Anywho it was fun.  The ending was in my personal oppinion lack luster with everything you gather through out the story you start to see whats up.  Atleast we did.  As for exact events we didn't have that figured and it made for an interesting addition but we both felt strange about it.\n\nStill no regrets from either of us about the $20 dollar price tag, and those whom complain that they just spent $5 bucks per hour of enjoyment we spent $10 and i will say $10 bucks per hour for a great time and pleasure of playing this game is worth it to keep this group of developers making games.  My suggestion is buy it call a friend have him pick up a six pack of a nice lager, and play the game. If you know someone who has this game call em up plan a day to drink and play it and just enjoy the time.  Maybe they themselves are regretting the purchase buy the beer and say hey now you've gotten some money back, (at this point they wont care because they have now officially enjoyed the game for a second playthrough) and you will have solved  The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.","October 2, 2014","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/polarizer/recommended/258520/","polarizer","Polarizer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/polarizer/","153 products in account","The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, a narrative adventure game from The Astronauts, is a miracle of game storytelling. It redefines immersion and sets the bar for realistic simulation of the natural world astonishingly high—one could even say, excessively high.\n\nIt tells a story about a young boy who appears to have vanished. The gameplay consists of an exploration of his world, uncovering and solving a number of mysteries about what appears to be happening.\n\nThe game warns you that it will not be holding your hand, and, through the protagonist, that things are not at all what they seem. The task of the reviewer is impossibly difficult because no explanation of how true this turns out to be can be made without spoiling the experience.\n\nAll I will say is this: welcome to the mind of a young boy.\n\nWith most games, the game-play is what matters the most. With this kind of game, however, spoiling the story will spoil the game. It is similar to other story driven games like “Papo and Yo,” “Brothers, a Tale of Two Sons,” “Gone Home,” and possibly also the Amnesia games (particularly the second of those). Although the visual style has drawn comparisons to “Dear Esther,” the games are only superficially similar. In "The Vanishing of Ethan Carter" one is very much a participant in events.\n\nThe game world is breathtakingly lavish and beautiful. For a small game, a massive effort at realism has been undertaken, and it succeeds wildly. If you've seen the game (not just screenshots) than you know that my praise is not excessive. Frankly, the story would have stood up well with a far less demanding art style. Yet they brought it off brilliantly.\n\nLike many adventure-story games, there are puzzles to solve (several of these are quite entertaining and clever; have a pen and paper handy), items to locate and put in their proper places, narrative chronologies to determine, locations to discover. The process of uncovering clues and discovering meaning is not difficult, yet the tasks are varied and interesting. The game is not a long one (I stretched it to more than six hours).\n\nHowever, this game integrates game-play and storytelling better than any game I’ve seen. Everything has a reason—even the fact that despite the realism of the world you’re exploring, the sun never moves in the sky. Everything is seamless and utterly engaging.\n\nNone of this would mean anything if it weren’t for the fact that, as the game progressed and the boy’s family situation became more and more clear, I found myself caring about him as if he were my own son. As Prospero the detective, I became dedicated to finding him, to helping him out of whatever desperate situation he found himself in. And the truth, revealed at last, is moving and satisfying as narrative in a way that few games have achieved. I've read novels that were less satisfying than the story in this game. Think about that a minute.\n\nI’ve got to salute the developer team for performing a miracle: they have created a story that is told in a completely believable world that could not be told in another medium.\n\nThe game is not without its flaws, the principal one being the auto-save system. The game encourages you to explore, and when you uncover the solution to one of the many mysteries, the solved state of that mystery is saved. Each successive “scene” is saved along with the others as you discover them. However, when you quit the game and return later, any scene that you’ve begun but not finished will revert to its “undiscovered” status. This is annoying until you realize what is happening; if you don’t get it quickly—I didn’t—you can potentially lose hours of wandering about. The game is a luscious world that begs you to wander about. Just realize that once you discover a clue, that means (generally) that there are other clues nearby, and that you need to find them all and complete that story segment before you can safely leave the game. It is true that the clues are generally in the same locations, so this is not difficult, but it helps to be forewarned.\n\nThere are also minor inconsistencies (in the version that I finished, it is possible to have two trains at once in the mine…), buttons that don’t seem to work properly the first time you press them, and other minor graphic glitches.\n\nBut none of these, even the auto-save system, which the developer assures us would be impractical to change at this point, detract in the least bit from the game. Once you get into the rhythm of it, and have completed your first scene, things proceed very smoothly.\n\nGamers who liked the games I mentioned earlier, or other story-driven but non-passive games will enjoy “The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.” The art design is best-in-class. The original musical score is haunting and beautiful, and is still playing in my head.\n\nBravo, Astronauts. Thanks for the wonderful story. I’m looking forward to your next project.","September 28, 2014","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It uses far-reaching landscapes and beautiful visual effects to bring you a great narrative experience. However, be warned, this game may not be for those of little patience.\n__________\n\nSynopsis:\n\nYou play as Paul Prospero, who seems to be a detective with paranormal abilities such as ESP. Receiving a letter from Ethan Carter, he learns Ethan has strong psychic connections, and that he has gone missing. Your job is to explore the village of Red Creek Valley and find Ethan. You quickly learn that something is amiss; the town is abandoned, no sign of Ethan's family, and mysterious occurrences.\n\nStory: A short, but interesting tale shrouded in mystery. Perhaps too short, depending on how quickly you progress through the game. It doesn't suffer very much from ups and downs in the story, and it ends pretty well too.\n\nGraphics: One of the most visually appealing games I've played in a long time. A wider, open world gives you plenty of room to stretch your legs and explore, taking in the sights and sounds as you go along.\n\nFunctionality: Controls are pretty linear and simple. Essentially a Sherlock Holmes-puzzle solving game. Pick stuff up, find where it goes, and solve problems.\n\nGameplay: Overall, it's not good. Again, it's basically a point-and-click mystery game akin to Sherlock Holmes. There is no combat mechanics, and every item falls into the one-use category. The real problem I encountered was spending obnoxiously long amounts of time searching the vast landscape for potential clues, which a majority of them felt arbitrary. This is where those of little patience may find the game frustrating.\n______________________________\n\nAt the end of the day, you're buying this game for the story and the experience; but the experience tends to fall short when you're slowly crawling over a couple acres of land looking for that one last piece of the puzzle. I feel this may have been a better release under a different venue, like Heavy Rain, which offers great atmosphere, narritive, and incorporates at least DECENT gameplay elements.\n\nI did enjoy it, but my advice would be to wait until this game goes on sale to purchase.","October 11, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I saw the trailers I thought "Hmmm, what a lovely looking game" and that held true.  Graphically, this game is top notch.  However, it is a little discordant: although supposedly set in some small town (presumably) in the US, the architecture and landscape are quintessentially mid-east European (think eastern Austria, Czech. Republic etc. and you get the idea).\n\nThe gameplay itself is quite linear in a meandering sort of a way so you are free to do as you wish within limits; if you don't complete some tasks then others will not become available.  The puzzles are reasonably challenging without being blockers - a little bit of logic will get you a long way in this game.  The storyline is really what is making me waver.  OK, I know it's a supernatural, horror type thing but it isn't an "omg, what the heck just jumped outta the walls at me" frighty game - it's more HP Lovecraft: dark, foreboding and, at times, rather depressing.  I've never been a fan of HP Lovecraft.  I don't want to say much more than that otherwise it will spoil things.\n\nIn short, if you're a fan of old school adventure games, beautifully executed and with a reasonable level of challenge then you will most likely love this game.

If you grew up and enjoyed those types of games as i did then prepare yourself for the future.\nFirstly, lets get the obvious out of the way, the world is absolutely gorgeous. Indoor, outdoor, lighting all looks amazing. When you see all the grass and trees moving in the wind it is very impressive. I could go on and on about the graphics, but thats just one feature.\nI really like how there is a small intro at the start and then it's where do you go, what do you want to do as you walk out of a tunnel. You play as Paul Prospero a pyschic detective who has shown up in the town of Red Rock to find a young fan who has dissappeared. The game is about exploration, and discovery. As you explore about you will come upon bodies who you will then try to piece together how they died. If you are a fan of Sherlock, its basically the same concept of finding the obvious and not so obvious clues and then placing events in chronological order and watching the crime unfold. Its a lot of fun, effective and the most important part, tells a cohesive story.\nWithout going into story spoliers, after you have completed the game i would suggest going to the deveopers discussion :http://www.theastronauts.com/2014/10/vanishing-ethan-carters-ending-extreme-spoilers/ Super interesting read and will help fill in some holes.\nMy only dissapointment in the game is the length.

It is however beautiful, atmospheric, and quite interesting while it lasts. Some will call it a 'walking simulator' (as if that is inherently a term of derision), some will call it indie, but me, I'll just call it interesting.\n\nThe Breathtaking of...\nEthan Carter is an amazing looking game for such a small studio. Let's just make that clear up front. Basically every moment is a perfect screenshot or video waiting to happen - it's a gorgeously detailed world thanks to their photo-scanning technology. It's a little...austere though, with no wildlife to speak of, and encounters with humans are few and far between. As much as a few birds or butterflies would've enlivened the world though, you only really notice because everything else looks so damn good!\n\nThe Playing of...\nEthan Carter is more contemplation than action. For the most part you'll be walking around, taking in the aforementioned beauty, and occasionally solving some light puzzles. In fact there's really only one 'action sequence' in the whole game to my mind; a slightly ill-conceived horror/chase section that aims for tense but trends more toward annoying. Beyond that misstep though, this is a game to be played and enjoyed at your own pace over the course of 3-5 hours. It took me five, but that's because I was looking (craving!) more interactions, collectibles, puzzles or hidden moments than the game actually delivered.\n\nThe Summarising of...\nEthan Carter is a solid first effort, displaying impressive visuals and a deft hand at atmosphere from developers The Astronauts. It's biggest fault is really that there isn't more of it - it's a big, beautiful world filled with not very much.

Gone Home, Dear Esther, Minervas Den) succeeds in creating a discovery-based story. Robert Frost's "The Road Not Taken" may best describe how the puzzles in this game are presented.\n\nThe world is beautiful and if you can run it at full resolution with ultra high details: do so. There were moments where I found myself just wandering and gazing at the landscape. It may still only be polygons and shaders, but the amount of detail found in just the juxtaposition of bare faced bedrock along against a subtle man-made pathways made me appreciate the craft of good CG modelling and level design. Things just felt right.\n\nThe Sound design is fantastic. I recommend playing with the music on, as it creates a great moody cinematic experience. Some may prefer only the ambience of the forest, but with a little tweaking, I found pushing the music back a couple notches and bringing the ambience up helped immensely with the immersion. Also, I recommend headphones with this experience.\n\nThere's so many moments in this game where I doubted the intentions of the storyteller, however, once I realized what I was witnessing, it only empowered my experience.\n\nNo doubt this is a game that for those who enjoyed Gone Home or Dear Esther should play.

I played through it over two days ago and I still can't stop thinking about it. It takes around four hours to play through which may be a turn-off for some, but the story is so compelling and the graphics are so beautiful that it's hard to put down. The writing is smart and at times intentionally ambiguous, which allows the player to ponder some of the deeper implications of the events presented. The creators seem to be heavily influenced by classic science-fiction and horror literature, and throughout the game pay homage to masters of the macabre like Edgar Allan Poe and H.P. Lovecraft. All of this is presented to the player in a world that is frighteningly beautiful and isolating. The end result is a game that continues to haunt you well after you've completed it.","May 9, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/audeez/recommended/258520/","audeez","Audeez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/audeez/","297 products in account","Beginning with a pointedly vague premise of your being some kind of detective on the trail of the titular missing child, the game barely holds your hand as you discover your paranormal investigative abilities and begin to piece together a series of strange events in a remote countryside. That lack of hand holding is more a part of the gameplay than one might initially realize as it ultimately provokes a sort of trial and error process that is in itself an investigation. Despite a few fairly simple puzzles, the game is mostly about discovery. While primarily linear, there are various clues and revelations lying just off the beaten path, many of which ultimately need to be discovered to complete the game, but that (whether found later or during the course of your primary investigation) don’t stymie the pace of the game.\n\nThe game’s visuals are excellent, featuring not only the river valley vistas seen in the early part of the game, but beautifully dilapidated interiors and dank caves as well. The audio as well is great, with a near perfect score, quality voice acting, and immersive environmental sound. The GUI overlays are brilliant and are realized in such a manner as not feel like an interface, but instead like an extension of the protagonist’s investigative abilities. The ultimate result is a greater sense of immersion and that is a large part of Ethan Carter’s triumph.\n\nThroughout the nearly four hours I spent with The Vanishing of Ethan Carter I was almost completely enraptured by it, spurred on both by a sense of wonderment at the world before my eyes and also by a drive to discover the truth of the mystery at hand. It’s difficult to talk about the story at all without spoiling anything except to say that even when predictable, Ethan Carter delivers with a compelling emotional gravitas. I honestly can’t recommend this game enough to fans of first person adventure games, especially Amenisia, Gone Home, or Dear Esther. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is worth picking up at any price.","January 8, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/polarizer/recommended/258520/","polarizer","Polarizer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/polarizer/","153 products in account","The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, a narrative adventure game from The Astronauts, is a miracle of game storytelling. It redefines immersion and sets the bar for realistic simulation of the natural world astonishingly high—one could even say, excessively high.\n\nIt tells a story about a young boy who appears to have vanished. The gameplay consists of an exploration of his world, uncovering and solving a number of mysteries about what appears to be happening.\n\nThe game warns you that it will not be holding your hand, and, through the protagonist, that things are not at all what they seem. The task of the reviewer is impossibly difficult because no explanation of how true this turns out to be can be made without spoiling the experience.\n\nAll I will say is this: welcome to the mind of a young boy.\n\nWith most games, the game-play is what matters the most. With this kind of game, however, spoiling the story will spoil the game. It is similar to other story driven games like “Papo and Yo,” “Brothers, a Tale of Two Sons,” “Gone Home,” and possibly also the Amnesia games (particularly the second of those). Although the visual style has drawn comparisons to “Dear Esther,” the games are only superficially similar. In "The Vanishing of Ethan Carter" one is very much a participant in events.\n\nThe game world is breathtakingly lavish and beautiful. For a small game, a massive effort at realism has been undertaken, and it succeeds wildly. If you've seen the game (not just screenshots) than you know that my praise is not excessive. Frankly, the story would have stood up well with a far less demanding art style. Yet they brought it off brilliantly.\n\nLike many adventure-story games, there are puzzles to solve (several of these are quite entertaining and clever; have a pen and paper handy), items to locate and put in their proper places, narrative chronologies to determine, locations to discover. The process of uncovering clues and discovering meaning is not difficult, yet the tasks are varied and interesting. The game is not a long one (I stretched it to more than six hours).\n\nHowever, this game integrates game-play and storytelling better than any game I’ve seen. Everything has a reason—even the fact that despite the realism of the world you’re exploring, the sun never moves in the sky. Everything is seamless and utterly engaging.\n\nNone of this would mean anything if it weren’t for the fact that, as the game progressed and the boy’s family situation became more and more clear, I found myself caring about him as if he were my own son. As Prospero the detective, I became dedicated to finding him, to helping him out of whatever desperate situation he found himself in. And the truth, revealed at last, is moving and satisfying as narrative in a way that few games have achieved. I've read novels that were less satisfying than the story in this game. Think about that a minute.\n\nI’ve got to salute the developer team for performing a miracle: they have created a story that is told in a completely believable world that could not be told in another medium.\n\nThe game is not without its flaws, the principal one being the auto-save system. The game encourages you to explore, and when you uncover the solution to one of the many mysteries, the solved state of that mystery is saved. Each successive “scene” is saved along with the others as you discover them. However, when you quit the game and return later, any scene that you’ve begun but not finished will revert to its “undiscovered” status. This is annoying until you realize what is happening; if you don’t get it quickly—I didn’t—you can potentially lose hours of wandering about. The game is a luscious world that begs you to wander about. Just realize that once you discover a clue, that means (generally) that there are other clues nearby, and that you need to find them all and complete that story segment before you can safely leave the game. It is true that the clues are generally in the same locations, so this is not difficult, but it helps to be forewarned.\n\nThere are also minor inconsistencies (in the version that I finished, it is possible to have two trains at once in the mine…), buttons that don’t seem to work properly the first time you press them, and other minor graphic glitches.\n\nBut none of these, even the auto-save system, which the developer assures us would be impractical to change at this point, detract in the least bit from the game. Once you get into the rhythm of it, and have completed your first scene, things proceed very smoothly.\n\nGamers who liked the games I mentioned earlier, or other story-driven but non-passive games will enjoy “The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.” The art design is best-in-class. The original musical score is haunting and beautiful, and is still playing in my head.\n\nBravo, Astronauts. Thanks for the wonderful story. I’m looking forward to your next project.","September 28, 2014","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I saw the trailers I thought "Hmmm, what a lovely looking game" and that held true.  Graphically, this game is top notch.  However, it is a little discordant: although supposedly set in some small town (presumably) in the US, the architecture and landscape are quintessentially mid-east European (think eastern Austria, Czech. Republic etc. and you get the idea).\n\nThe gameplay itself is quite linear in a meandering sort of a way so you are free to do as you wish within limits; if you don't complete some tasks then others will not become available.  The puzzles are reasonably challenging without being blockers - a little bit of logic will get you a long way in this game.  The storyline is really what is making me waver.  OK, I know it's a supernatural, horror type thing but it isn't an "omg, what the heck just jumped outta the walls at me" frighty game - it's more HP Lovecraft: dark, foreboding and, at times, rather depressing.  I've never been a fan of HP Lovecraft.  I don't want to say much more than that otherwise it will spoil things.\n\nIn short, if you're a fan of old school adventure games, beautifully executed and with a reasonable level of challenge then you will most likely love this game.

It doesn't hold your hand.  Nothing is "obvious" in regards to path or connections to the story.  You have to earn it by exploring and acting the detective that you are.  That means combing the woods, paths, buildings, or whatever you can see.  Most of the clues are fairly close together to one another, but there are some that are not.  You will not know until you explore every place that you are physically able to.  I love this sort of game because it is rare in today's gaming culture.  The masses play games now and the masses want simplicity.  This game is not simple.  It will frusterate you at times because you will not know what your next move is.  Youtube tutorials will be a constant temptation, but I urge you to only use them when you absolutly have to.  Discovering and figuring out things on your own is what motivates you to go on.  The story is well thought out, but there isn't a lot of dialogue that will help you along the way.  If this game was to have come out on consoles it'd be worth the normal $60 price tag, so you know its a steal for $20.  It's a memorable game that will hopefully influence a genre that will be improved upon even more than this game presents.  Give it a try if you want a challenging story that encourages exploring.  If you think that sounds boring, this game is not for you.","February 23, 2015","true","30.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you like puzzles that don't hold your hand and just give you the world, this is for you! The world is beautiful, and the puzzles are hard. If you miss anything for a puzzle or scene as the game calls it, it won't stop you. Just later on you will have to redo or complete it. I know that from experience, but luckily it was only one and it was very short. You have to be very opened eyed or explorative to find some of the clues or items. A few had me stuck for a while. The only gripe I had with this game is the save system. If you haven't completed a scene or have gotten a clue it will not save. I had found a work around for this but it was later in the game, when you get on the elevator and move and get off it saves. For example you just get in press "up" then "stop" then "down" it will save.

Its atmosphere is one of semi-constant uneasiness which will keep you on your toes as you explore its ominous locales.\n\nThe main mechanism to advance the story is basically to stumble upon a mystery as you make your way across the setting and solve a few basic puzzles in order to figure out what happened. Said mysteries can be solved in any order.\n\nSome cons of the game are the checkpoint save system and some stuttering issues. Besides these, the game is smooth as a 25 year old Rum Zacapa.\n\nAll in all, it's atmospheric and aesthetically pleasing but with some shortcomings, especially its short duration.

If you want to see it like a movieesque experience it's well worth it's price.\n\nIt's super beautiful, it's eerie and it's best played without knowing too much about it beforehand.\n\nIf you like storytelling, slower pace, beautiful environments and a more poetic style like Poe or Lovecraft then this game is probably right for you.","February 1, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The last time I remember seeing graphics that I almost couldn't believe existed was in the summer of 1997 when they began advertising the pre-rendered FMV cutscenes from Final Fantasy VII. There is - quite frankly - nothing to even compare it to graphically at the moment beyond simple stylistic examples, of which the closest competitor might be Dear Esther.\n\nThe soundtrack is very good for setting the vaguely-unsettling mood that drives the plot of the game at a nice, unhurried pace. While none of the tracks are overly thematic - you won't be whistling the bridge song tomorrow afternoon - they're finely crafted and handsomely performed.\n\nThe gameplay itself is essentially a walking simulator mixed with an extremely easy point-and-click adventure game; in other words, nothing to write home about but effective nonetheless. Mechanically, the entire purpose of the game is to uphold a beautiful story, a function that is served amazingly well, in part because the mythos itself is so grippingly bizarre in a Cthulhu-like way.\n\nMy final verdict is that the game is essentially flawless for what it is and what it set out to be; a great many AAA development studios could learn a thing or two from looking at The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.","April 2, 2015","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sure, I still preferred to have some Marines with me, but I wasn't even sure anymore if the realm I was in was real, or unreal (oh, btw, game uses Unreal Graphics Engine). I was able to solve the first puzzle regarding a dead guy (CSI style), then, I thought I was too smart for this game, until I reached the next puzzle. Youtube could save my intelligence there a bit, so I was able to solve the problem, thanks to youtube, but I was smart enough to know where to find answers when you need them, so that doesn't make me that stupid.\nI am now heck who knows how long into the game, saved a few additional puzzles and all I can say is, to be honest, I have no idea. So let me list the Cons and Pros.\nBy the way, if you are a COD or BF fanboy, I think this game is nothing for you, you are able to throw a hand grenade into a lake at one point for no reason, that is all about the action you will get up to my point.\n\nPros:\n- You jump up from your chair a few times, scary moments....especially if you are a weakling like me that was too afraid to play Dead Space 2 and other such horror games when being over 30 years of age.\n- Graphics if your rig can support max graphics is nearly RL.\n- You think of Marines being brought in any second, but it doesn't happen. Game suceeds in adding creepyness.\n- You are able to ride a small train over severed legs.\n- You feel like being some serious CSI dude after a while.\n- You have no idea what the heck is going on, but things start adding themselves together, however, apparently there is still something very, very, very bad awaiting me, it also has a name from a horror movie, I am still hoping Marines to be able to come to help later on in the game.\n- You reading this and giving me a LIKE.\n- Price: it is good atm for what the game is, truly.\n- Good few hours of your lifetime spent.\n\nCons\n- Save system does not exist, just an auto-save that saves after major events like solving a murder case. So play this game ONLY if you know you can spare about 1 hour, otherwise you gota do the whole thing over.\n- No Marines so far.\n- No weapons unless a hand grenade that you find, if you find it. There was an option for me to throw it into the lake, so I threw it... I hope I was not dumb enough to have wasted the grenade, because the more I play this game, the more I feel like I will be needing that grenade in the end... oh well. They could have at least throw in a pistol with some ammo, would have felt saver at least...\n- Space key is useless. You cannot jump in the game. For a gamer that uses since 20 years the space key to jump, that is serious business. I still kept pressing it tho all the time and nothing happened.\n\nSo, let's see how this continous, the reason I am writing this is because I just solved another murder case, so finally the auto-save worked (if it did, you do not even see if it did save or not), anyway, gota take a dump now and then walk my dog, yeah just get the game and play it.","April 2, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It feels real. I mean really real, although it sounds kind of ridiculous. Well, at least when you do not look really closely. Wind is slowly swinging grass, tress, bushes and etc. Combining this with abandoned railroad and houses and, of course, mountain range environment the game creates feelings of lonelyness and melancholy. But after a few tens of minutes player will realise that something really weird is happening around there. Or maybe was happening...\n\nAfter this, the game will make you think. Not too hard, not too much. but still think... How to solve, where's the catch. Because the more you solve, the more story you'll uncover. And thus the game gets as interesting, as it is beautiful. And even if you won't be able to solve everything and leave some mysteries behind, you will still get to the very end of the game to see, to know what really happened there...\n\nAnd now i'll put aside my emotions and feelings and try to point out some pros and cons of this game.\n\nPros:\n-interesting story with a few or even none flaws in it;\n-breathtaking and detailed environment;\n-kind of empty but still alive world;\n-really good soundtrack;\n-simple game mechanics;\n-even more interesting when played with someone.\n\nObjective cons:\n-seems to be overpriced for its length;\n-later on the puzzles give you the feeling that they are a bit unfinished (at least some of them);\n-is really violent (I wouldn't recommend this for underaged or really sensitive people).\n\nSubjective cons:\n-puzzles were too easy for me with most of them taking like 5-7 minutes to solve them;\n-in my opinion, it would be great if the puzzles had a little different solution mechanics and would make you to think more;\n-i'm not sure if this was my machine but I had some minor lags and one bug that needed a game restart to be solved.\n\nFor the record, I played this with my girlfriend who isn't a fan of computer games. But she enjoyed this game a lot, loved the story, loved the time we spent for it.\n\nSo... This game is really worth to buy and play, even if it's short and overpriced. Want to buy a book with a good plot and sophisticated point of view towards the world? Do it... But consider this game as well, because it's almost as good as any of Stephen Kings' horror stories.\n\nShort update: in my review the time spent for this game is not shown correctly - with long strolls and taking time to enjoy the views this game took me about 6 hours to complete it with doing all the achievements.","April 13, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Absolutely incredible at building an environment to play in.\nLittle bit of a learning curve though. This game is a bit...different to play, than any other game I've played before. A lot of weird things go on, that can sometimes creep you out.

The look and feel you get from this world sucks you in, you want to look at everything, you want to look whats over there.\n\nThe thing I enjoyed the most about this game, is that it does not help you and tell you where to go.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shiaakuma/recommended/258520/","shiaakuma","shiaakuma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shiaakuma/","701 products in account","This game is incredibly atmospheric and completely gorgeous, but that's not what makes it fun to play.  It has an interesting story, immersed with equally interesting side-stories, can be played in any order, and is surprising enough at the end that I didn't really "see it coming" in terms of resolution.  Here's a very short rundown on what it offers and what it doesn't, to help you make a decision on trying it or not.  Note that I'm not making these "pros and cons" as opinion could vary wildly on whether these are good or bad points.  Here's what it offers instead.\n\nWhat it has:\n-a compelling mystery storyline that can be completed in any order (however all parts do need to be completed to see the end)\n-a "walking simulator" format that is based almost entirely on exploration with isolated puzzles.  Puzzles vary in complexity (there are walkthroughs available online for the more obscure solutions, but probably aren't necessary for most people experienced with puzzles).\n-Stunning graphics.  Bear in mind, however, that if you're running an older computer (like me), you might have to turn down some of the visual settings.  Personally, I spent a few minutes wowing at the scenery and then had to roll back the settings; however, even with lower settings it's a beautiful game.\n-A quietly chilling atmophere that is generally not "scary" but maintains a slow, creeping eerieness.  With the exception of one puzzle area that incorporates some jump scares, they keep the horror aspect to the quiet, psychological variety.\n\nWhat it doesn't have:\n-Save points.  The game autosaves at the end of each puzzle area (regardless of the order you complete in), which makes for smooth gameplay but also means that you can't stop mid-puzzle and come back later.  Generally though, the areas are not grossly spread out so restarting from the completion of the previous puzzle doesn't set you back much unless you had mostly finished an area before quitting.\n-Combat.  You walk and solve puzzles, but you don't fight anything.  There is a section where you have to avoid a nasty thing, but it'll just set you back to the beginning of the area.\n-Tutorial, guidance, or rules.  They tell you flat out at the beginning that they won't hold your hand, and they mean it.  Thankfully, the interface is very simple so at least in that respect, handholding is not necessary.\n\nSo that's the nutshell summary of what the game offers.  If you like the walking-simulator style, mysteries, and puzzles, you may like this one.  If you like big action, combat, and explosions, you may not.  Your mileage may vary!","January 4, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The music also plays big part in its beauty - it is a fitting theme for the unfolding setting and events.\n\nWriting is kept on first glance simple and short, but actually has enough depth and hidden nuances once you delve deeper into it and keep attention to the details. Also a second playthrough puts a lot of it into different pesrpective. Hell, even on the first playthrough you'll soon enough start looking at the things you read or hear in a different light.\n\nAnother thing I loved is - the game really doesn't hold your hand, or at least does it minimally. It leaves the setting, story and game-bits unfold in whatever order and pace you choose. But especially if you're the kind to leave no stone unturned - you'll get handsomely rewarded for that.\n\nThis game is a truly delightful and amazing experience, I really hope we'll soon see more like it (and similar experiments like Gone Home) breaking the mold.","February 9, 2015","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Incredibly original concept. Why cant all games look this good (and run flawlessly)? For being Mystery genre, with puzzle aspects, and full atmospheric immersion, its a total slam dunk in every category you can place it in. The devs of this game need to teach Techland how to create their map for Dying Light. (I know, I know, a city is mych different to render than a forest...dont leave stupid comments)\n\nOne thing that amazes me is that so many games are trying to stand out by being "open world". Yet, take a game like Ethan Carter, and you realize that you dont need an open world environment to be good. Thoughtful writing creatives a narrative. Situations are revealed through the narrative, supported by the visual environment, and you have the basis of immersion. Open world or not, if you cant do at least one of those things well in a fpd style game, then it sucks. Ethan Carter not only does the basics right, but it does everything right.\n\nI fully expected a game this beautiful to not run smoothly. OR I expected to have to turn the settings down. It runs smoother than any game I have yet played. And I can run it at default settings (which are high by default) or even tweak it all the way up on the few options that are set moderately, and it still runs just as smooth.\n\nSo far, I cant think of any area where this game falls short. It seems to excel in every category. And everywhere else it redefines quality and hopefully raises the bar for all other devs moving forward.\n\nIts easily a 10/10 - Buy it\n\nPS: Have I ever given a game a 10/10 before? And this isnt even my favorite type of game either","February 10, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, even if you like games that are action-packed and filled with nothing but cause and effect, taking some time to fall in love with this game will offer you a very rare and special singleplayer experience. Although many other games offer rich story and even more content, this game seems to succeed much more, for me, in capturing you in its Lovecraftian universe. Overall, I certainly reccomend you pick this up if you need a short break from traditional and more popular action based games. Its $20 price tag is well worth the wonderful experience, but you can often catch it on sale if you're low on Steam money. So if you're ready to spend about 4 or so hours to get caught up in the world of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, I reccomend it. Out of 10 I'd give it a solid 8.5, and hope you have just as much fun as I had with this game.","February 10, 2015","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Maybe it's because this game identifies with me so well, through a romantic ambience, made through beautiful graphics, and music that fits perfect to the view of the enviroment.\nSo I'll try to describe it, as to give the next potential buyer an inpression from a neutral source, something in recent times has been difficult (I'm of course thinking of "gamejournalist sites" such as Kotaku, Rockpapershotgun among many, all taken in being corrupt)\n\nMy oppinion was almost immideatly turned possitive, simply because the graphics were good. The grass swayed in the wind, and the wind could only be described as a gentle summerbreeze brushing your face, all made real by the amazing sound effects.\nThat combined with the gorgious music that tickled my ears, all whilst it made the game that much better through ambience, and mood.\nI will be the first to admit that I got gotten by the few jumpscares that exist in this game, but they made sense, I'd like to tell how, but that would spoil parts of the game, but know that there are a mindbending reason to the few scares.\n\nThe view in the game itself shows the beauty of the game as a whole. There are many enviromental lookout points, all of which I stopped at, the soak in the beautiful nature that this game shows. The sound of birds, the water flowing, be it through the damn in the game, or onto the beach, it is all an amazing experience.\n\nI don't normally say this, but as short as this game is, it being around 5-7 hours, it is, in my opinion (and I am a big fan of long game, so this should be taken even more as a compliment) worth it, even through its short story.\n\nI would rate this game 9/10\n\nI truly hope the developers see this, if they do, here are my tips:\n\nIt would make a lot of sense to make a serie about the deeprooted issues you show in the game. You showed very well how amazing your idea of a game, that dosen't push a message on you, can be performed.\nIf you choose to make a follow up, or make another game, do try to make the game longer.\n\nIf I were to compare, or give a perspective to another game, it would be "Dear Esther"\nI played the game before it got the Steam Greenlight deal, but it too is a very narrative game, and it too has amazing scenic enviroments.\n\nIf any of this felt like something you would enjoy, give this narrative heavy, beautifully made game a chance.\n\nThis has been a review by The Real Joker, signing out","October 7, 2014","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Lovecraft, so I make a point of checking out every game or movie that claims to be inspired by his work.  Usually the end result is pretty weak sauce, but sometimes I find epic experiences like Eternal Darkness or Dark Corners of the Earth ... or shorter, but still powerful stories like Ethan Carter.\n\nThe game's story is more in line with Lovecraft's early work, with the focus on internalized existential angst with a smattering of references to the wider mythos and the power of dreams.  It's a slower, more personal, self-contained story, rather than one about ancient aliens rising up from terrible slumber to end humanity, which is fine.\n\nGameplay is all about investigating a series of murders in the gorgeously rendered Red Creek Valley while searching for Ethan Carter.  There is no combat and no way to die (although there is a gamebreaking bug that I at first mistook for character death towards the end, if you solve one of the puzzles before the final murder, that requires you to close the game and continue from the previous save).\n\nThe unique method of sensing the psychic residue of strong emotions and reconstructing the timelines of the murders is clever and provides the only real "action" to what is primarily a short story you get to walk through and witness.  There are no outcomes to change, no secret endings, no agency for you as a player at all, really, other than the order in which you solve the murders.\n\nGraphically, the game is beautiful, alternating between peaceful and creepy, as needed.  The environments look and sound real and are the key to the experience.  Lesser visuals would have hurt the immersion.  The character models are less impressive by comparison, but the voice acting makes up for that and provides some believable personalities.  I would recommend you disable Motion Blur in the Graphics options, as I found it nauseating and a distraction from the great artwork done for the game.\n\nTotal game time, exploring every possible location is 4-5 hrs, and for an $8 game, I can't really complain.  I pay more than that to see a 2 hr movie at the theatre.  Replayability is practically nil, however.  Once you have solved a murder or puzzle the hard way (without a guide - using one will only hurt your experience in the long run), you can easily burn through it again without much effort, further cutting down the game time to less than 2 hrs, easily, accounting for walking time and watching the cutscenes.  You'd be better off introducing someone else to the game, rather than play through it multiple times.  Then you could discuss the ending!\n\nFor an additional $4, you can get a digital map, poster, making of document, and the origianl soundtrack, which I purchased to support the developers and found worth it for the great atmospheric music alone.\n\nIf you want to experience a beautiful visual tale of mystery and the occult in the vein of H.P. Lovecraft, there's hardly a better way to spend a lazy afternoon.","April 3, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Which sucks at first when you are confused and don't know what the f**k is going on but you can figure the game out pretty quick and I think the lack of hand holding is nice. It allows you...or makes you...enjoy the setting by wandering around and exploring.\n\nThe story is amazing!\n\nThe ending....OMG. I still can't get over it.\n\nThe bad thing about this game is the saving. It saves after you accomplish something and shows up in small writing at the top of the screen. It was annoying at first when I wanted to stop playing but couldn't because I didn't know when it last saved. Also my PC kept crashing ( because it does that, not because of the game) so I had to replay some things, but honestly it doesn't take that long to redo something. And once you trigger an elevator...going up or down it triggers an auto save.\n\nSome people say this game has not replay value and I would argue that it does and does't. It's all depnds on the person, I personally feel it has a good replay value, espeacially if you wanted to do a speed run or something.\n\nI would recomend buying this game...but not at full price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/castorquinn/recommended/258520/","castorquinn","castorquinn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/castorquinn/","380 products in account","In Brief\nSomewhere between walk-'em-up and adventure game, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter blends the best elements of both.\n\nMost valuable resource:  The atmosphere.\nOf interest to: people who like their walk-'em-ups with just a tad more gameplay.\n\nThe Vanishing of Ethan Carter received a lot of buzz in the indie-sphere, and rightly so.  It also has its detractors, and I can understand why.  There is just enough game here for it to be unequivocally a game, unlike other narrative-driven walking simulators like Dear Esther and Gone Home and thus, like Eidolon - another gamified stroller - Ethan Carter left itself open to criticism focusing only on the game elements.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, the game elements here are brilliant.  You are a supernatural investigator who stumbles across murder victims, hunts for clues using your psychic sense, assembles them, then gets to see little still poses of the victim and their murderer assembled around the scene.  By tagging them in the correct chronological order, you get to view a cutscene that explains what happened.  This denouement is masterfully done.  The process of stumbling across and then piecing together all the elements of the crime is entertaining, and doesn't break your immersion in the tense atmosphere the game is building by forcing you to involve yourself in mindless tasks or fiddly interfaces.\n\nBut while these murders drive the narrative, the crime scene investigation definitely plays second fiddle to you just walking around this town.  I think the balance is just right, but for those who like more game in their game, the short running time combined with the few instances of this interesting mechanic equals not much game.  And I think that's a real shame, because the beauty of this game is in the way it artfully places you in a plausible scenario dealing with increasingly implausible elements that all have such gravity because the scene, the mood, the atmosphere are all so engrossing and so foreboding.\n\nThe one criticism I do have is that that one wonderful mechanic is not explained.  It is barely referenced that you have this extra sense, and how your window on the past expands by assembling clues is never mentioned at all.  It doesn't help that the very first scene you encounter, the one where your powers are introduced, is completely atypical, lacking a body or any clues to assemble, and using a different visual to literally every other instance of the sense that occurs the entire duration of the game.  As far as communicating mechanics organically through gameplay goes, that's a cardinal sin.  I feel like the developers have heard this complaint before, and have inserted a warning up-front that the game does not hand-hold as a defence against this criticism, but if you find your players are googling "ethan carter touch not working" so frequently that google autocompletes the search three words in you've not communicated well enough.  And that's a real shame, because having to backtrack to redo the puzzles you didn't realise were puzzles kinda breaks the flow of the narrative and takes you out of the game.\n\nI do want to especially call out the jump scare section.  Ethan Carter is that rarest of beasts: a horror(-ish) game with an effective and appropriate jump scare.  Half way through the game, when the tension has been built and you're starting to get a sense that these are more than just mundane murders, this terrifying section comes out of nowhere, with no warning, and is genuinely terrifying.  Not just shocking or unexpected, but dreadful.  The fact that this section was managed so well is all you need to know to be sure that the whole game is subtle and intelligent and very expertly crafted as an experience.\n\nAnd it's beautiful, as all walk-'em-ups must be.  Unlike Mind: Path to Thalamus's saturated surreality, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is delicate, and wistful, and melancholic, but every inch as artistically gorgeous.  Take frequent scenic screenshots and you will be set for desktop wallpapers for a good long time.\n\nAs a piece of Innsmouth writing, it is utterly on-pitch in its length and narrative progression.  If you're a fan of the understated horror of actual Lovecraft, rather than the Cthulu monsterism that has taken over the horror genre, this is a perfect experience for you.  It's not a long game, but it is exactly the right length.\n\nThat said, I do hope there will be a sequel.  The set-up in terms of mechanics and theme here makes that perfectly possible, and it would be a real shame if we didn't get to play with this system again.","April 4, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's like playing through an old scary story along the lines of Algernon Blackwood or H.P. Lovecraft, with some investigation gameplay that is among the best crime scene gameplay I've ever seen and which matches the mood and atmosphere of the setting. Due to their method of using interpolated photographs of real objects to make a lot of the 3D models, the game looks much better than other current gen games that have the same technical level of graphics but which use the standard method of 3d modeling. The game looks much more photorealistic than any other I've played, and it helps the mysterious atmosphere a lot. The story, atmosphere, and gameplay all go together extremely well and make for a great experience.","March 18, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But in my opinion the story is really good, in contrast with Gone Home that is somewhat basic. It can be hard to make the player engaged in the exploration of a rich story and not get lost in it's complexity in the middle of the game, but this game just makes it perfect.\n\nActually, the word perfect, describes the game well. Everything in it is perfect. The story, the setting of the abandoned village in the middle of mountains, the soundtrack, the voice casting, the technological visual marvel, the game mechanics to solve the mysteries, the mood.\n\nThe only downside that I can see in the game, is the lack of save functionality. The game has auto-save in certain key-points, normally after completing a sub-story. For one side, I didn't get frustrated by it, since the mood and involvement the game creates, you just want to keep playing it. But it can be troublesome if for some reason you need the stop playing and you are in the middle of something.\n\nHope to see more games like this. Maybe it revitalize the genre of point-click adventure games, following this game steps.\n\nOne of the best games ever played. 10/10","July 10, 2015","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The beauty of this game is striking and is something that will be mentioned in countless other reviews. Even though it may only take about 4-5 hours to finish, you may end up taking much longer than that because every few seconds you'd want to stop and stare at the scenery. Just make sure you don't spam your activity feed with screenshots of the whole game. No doubt you would be tempted to.\n\nProps must also be given to the sound in this game. Ambient sounds combined with brilliantly written music create the perfect atmosphere. They complement the environment making you feel wonder, awe or even terror.\n\nApart from looking gorgeous, Ethan Carter tells a story that is very well written. As you progress through the game you will encounter puzzles of varying difficulty and upon solving them you uncover pieces of the story. Even though some aspects of Ethan's tale will no doubt be confusing (I was scratching my head at many scenes) it remains engaging throughout, leaving you itching to know what happens next.\n\nThere are a few small issues I had with the game, nothing major. This is just me nitpicking. It is a very short game and the puzzles are not aplenty. Most of them I was able to solve easily. Only one or two required some serious thought. Nonetheless, they were all fun to do.\n\nAt full price, Ethan Carter is $20. I paid half of that in the Winter Sale and it found it to be a great buy for what I paid. It's up to you if you want to pay full price for this very short indie title (Ignore the 30hrs I have clocked on Steam, I had gone out and forgot to exit the game) but if you do, I doubt you would regret it.","January 5, 2015","true","30.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a game based on story and exploration. No action, minimal puzzles. As long as that doesn't completely put you off the whole idea, then definitely give this a try. It's eerie, subtle horror at its finest- no jump scares, no looming theat (except for one very brief, easy to beat segment). And yet the game left me deeply chilled, and more than a little bit sad.\n\nBut if you play, have a guide on hand. Not because the puzzles are hard (they're not), but because some things are easy to miss- and you have to solve every puzzle in order to complete the game. If you don't want to spend an hour backtracking to that one spot you missed, check the guide every so often to make sure you haven't skipped anything. No need to read ahead or spoil things for yourself- just read up to the point you reached and see if there's anything you should have done.","May 3, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The textures and design are nothing short of delicious.  The story is really engaging and kept me and my SO hooked start to finish.  We are Myst junkies so we love puzzles and mystery.  We spent a solid hour just scowering the forrest for pieces of something that wasn't there.\n\nI guess the only sad thing about this game is it really is quite easy complete.  The puzzles usually solve themselves, or have the answer somewhere near by.  In the Myst series we were used to searching everywhere for clues to the answer for the next puzzle.  Not necessary in this game.\n\nINCLUDING the hour spent in the forrest we beat this game in one afternoon (4 hours).  Which was pretty disapointing.\nWe only spent $8 on sale so it really didn't offend us, the visuals and the way they played out the story was absolutely worth it.\n\nTLDR; GREAT GAME - EASY - DEDICATE AND AFTERNOON AND GO START 2 FINISH","April 4, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The landscape and buildings seem to be of a time and place one can't easily pin down, though the setting is somewhere in the modern day USA. I was reminded of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. by lonely hills, forests, and tunnels that may or may not be haunted. The supernatural exploration detective game Betrayer comes to mind as well as the paranormal investigator protagonist combs the terrain for clues.\nThe story is hit or miss. I had a hard time buying into the story, but I was familiar with the type of tale being told. The incorporation of certain horror literature elements were rather well done but it was the interpersonal family dynamics that weren't as convincing as they could have been. The "twist" ending (depending on your point of view) wasn't very profound and the idea of ghosts "letting go" alternately fascinates and bores me. It was done reasonably well in Betrayer, dealing with cursed souls, and handled rather clumsily in Murdered: Soul Suspect, which over-relied on the concept.\nIf all that is appealing to you, buy the game at full price - it will be worth it.\nIf on the other hand, you're marginally interested in a game of a different pace than your usual frenetic adventure games, buy it on sale. Either way, I'm confident it will be money well spent.","July 28, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The amount of effort that went into crafting every meter of the world here is unmatched even by the best triple-A teams working on budgets orders of magnitude bigger. This is a masterpiece in environment art, an example to study. I definitely recommend reading the development blogs of the project for the look into the process - lots of developers should learn from this game.\n\nThis carefully crafted environment is not there to be a passive eye candy either - it's an irreplaceable tool for telling the story. It sets the mood, manipulates your expectations and carefully directs your progression through the story.\n\nI'm not really sure what can be done to improve the game, actually. It's a complete, well-executed, focused product. There is no need for more action, the peaceful walks at your own pace are the definitive way to go through the experience - there is no place for explosions, crowds or thrilling chases here. There is no need for bigger environment - you don't need rock climbing, wing suits, boats and additional ten kilometers of lush forest to tell this story. There is no need for weapons, for inventory, for HUD.\n\nThe sound work deserves high praise too - the environment is brought to life through masterful use of ambient, and the music is brilliant. So yeah, can definitely recommend this. Even if you prefer more active genres, this is a game is worth supporting - it represents the work attitude, fascination with art and understanding of narratives that I would love to see more in the game development industry.","September 27, 2014","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is really a stunning looking game. I'm really surprised I can't actually smell the environment through my screen because it looks so beautiful. 10/10 - This really sets a bar, and simply needs to be experienced to be believed.\n\nSound design is also exceptional. All the music and other auditory cues are timed very well and create a good atmosphere. I do feel that a lot of games get this right, though. Having played other games where atmosphere is important, I think developers realize that you just can't build a good immersive game without the proper auditory cues. This game makes great use of its music, sound effects, and just absolute, dead silence whenever necessary. It creates a very eerie atmosphere indeed.\n\nThe story is very intriguing itself. It's got a nice, Bioshock level twist at the end. I do have to say that I expected this game to be a bit more focused on the "horror" aspect, and I found the story undermines it a little bit. It's hard to explain this without actually spoiling the story, but needless to say, I felt fairly confident that I'm unlikely to be in any actual threat, or at least the threats are going to be rather infrequent. It's not a bad story, though, in fact quite the contrary, it's a good story told very well. It just happens to miss the theme that I was expecting from the game. It's still very chilling as it progresses. It's just that you as a character are not participating in it, just observing it.\n\nNow on with the negatives.\n\nSteam will show that my play time for this game is about 3 hours or so. That's how long it really took to get through this game. Why is it so short? It makes it feel more like a minigame than a full fledged title. This short play time really makes me wish that the developers actually cut down some of the time they spent on the graphics and sunk more of it into creating an actual game. Pretty graphics are all well, but I want a good game.\n\nAnd that's another thing. This game can well be called an Eerie Walking Simulator. It's very minimalistic in almost all content that actually matters. It's a great experience, but it's so hard to actually call this a game. I think I would have felt no shame in just watching someone play it on youtube. It would spare me some of the backtracking if I just happened to miss one of the puzzles in the world, having to go back to it just to unlock the final narrative. I do like the fact that no one is holding your hand, however, and the fact that the world is, for the most part, open even if there is little of it.\n\nOverall, the experience is great, and the quality of execution is superb, but because of that, quantity suffers greatly. At 3-5 hours, you can easily finish it in one sitting even if you take your time to explore the environment.\n\nI'll recommend the game, but only if its on sale. I give it 7/10, just because of its length and the small amount of stuff to do in it. Despite the shortness, it's got a great story, great graphics, and great sound. If you can't get it on sale, watch it somewhere on youtube because it's worth at least that much.","September 19, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are so many details to find and theories to craft that each player will get an experience of his own. The game mechanics are all solid enough to hold the game together and keep you interested through the whole journey. Sound and world design can compete with AAA titles, yet alone put many of them to shame. But the pacing and openness of the world also dictate your speed. The overall experience may last between 3-5h, and your mileage can vary greatly depending on your capability to find the important areas soon enough without getting frustrated.\n\nBut having finally reached the end you will feel a bit like an astronaut.

Though this is the first release by the newly formed developer they are built up of very experienced developers and The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter certainly passes off that vibe. The game plays out with you, Paul Prospero, walking throughout the small village of Red Creek Valley. The core of the game consists of you going through the town solving each murder mystery that the town has to offer, which is quite a few for such a small place. Since the core of the game is it’s story, I’m going to write this review without going into details on the story, so rest assured this review will remain spoiler free.\n\nSo like I said the game plays out as a first person mystery solver. The game begins with the text “This game is a narrative experience that does not hold your hand” and that is about the most definitive statement I can say about this game. The game is totally open world and will not give you any guides or hints about where to go or what to do. This is nice in the sense that you are totally free to explore the world and solve mysteries as you stumble upon them. As you explore you’ll notice items that seem to be missing from scenes. As you explore the world you’ll often find the missing items scattered around so that you can investigate and pick up the items. When you finish putting a scene back together you are able to open a portal into another dimension to explore and discover the secrets of what happened in the world. Exploring the story was interesting and though it felt like a good bit of the story didn’t quite fit in at the time of discovery, after further exploring and really examining the environments the pieces all came together. The story is really the reason to play the game. Their really isn’t much action, and you will spend almost all of your time exploring, examining and then walking to your next location.\n\nLuckily walking around the game world means you get to view more of the environments. The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter has possibly the best graphics I’ve ever seen in a video game. I mean the world is truly astonishing and is incredibly realistic. There were a number of times I actually had to stop playing, to admire the fact that what I was staring at was not a real life picture. And with the exception of one location, a mine, all were very unique yet realistic in their design. Not to say that the mine wasn’t well designed, but compared to the rest of the world the rocky maze like mine just seemed rather boring. The titles sound effects were not nearly as well done as the games graphics but quite honestly I found myself so indulged in the visuals of the game that I very rarely focused on the sound effects.\n\nFinally the ending of the game is one that I really enjoyed. The ending doesn’t explicitly say what happens one way or another. This works especially well because The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter leaves the story open to certain speculations. The end is left for you to sit, think about the events of the game and determine how it ends. Additionally the amount of small details you’ve paid attention to can actually have great effects on how you interpret things which can ultimately lead to an alternate view on the ending than you would have had otherwise. Unfortunately The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter is very short at roughly four to five hours to complete and because of the way the story plays out replay value is limited.\n\n8/10\n\nPROS\n• The best visuals seen in recent years\n• Small details that can effect the way you see the ending\n• Very well done open ended ending\n\nCONS\n• Story is only about 4-5 hours length\n• The design of the mine level","October 16, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Pieces don't fall in place until the end, and the outcome might leave the player emotionally unrewarded. Nonetheless it compresses the game's themes into a satisfying whole.\n\nThe story's hopefulness is its love letter to literature. It's the celebration of imagination and the naivistic nod to those who have tried to escape desolation in a dysfunctional family.

The player moves through an enormous world while investigating unknown events that occured there, gradually revealing a story in chunks at a time.\n\nEven as soon as the first scene loads, it becomes apparent that the game does not plan on helping you figure much out.  The story progresses only when you manage to figure out certain nondescript sequences of events that are required to move the game forward. There are no loading screens, and you are left to wander in a quiet forest and valley of intimidating size and detail until you figure it out.  This is not a miserable thing, however, because the graphics are fantastic, the sound effects are incredibly lifelike, and the score is perfectly fitting.  When the realization hits you that you've figured out exactly what the devil that one critical action does that you've been hung up on for so long (and when it actually helps), you can progress with relative ease.  Once you learn to speak the language of its concepts, the game becomes much more enjoyable.  Dare I say it reminds me of  Myst  because of that? Again, not a miserable thing despite the possible implications.\n\nThe graphics and game engine really are astounding.  The forest areas are so realistic in composition to real life, it's like the developers took a photo somewhere in the most picturesque forest known to man and animated every minute detail of it.  Not only that, the architectural design of the buildings and props is astute as well.  If one can find flaw in this game, it is most likely not going to be in the visuals.\n\nThe story itself is very interesting and clever once you get used to its delivery.\n\nThe Vanishing of Ethan Carter  is well worth the experience.  It is consistently interesting and engaging throughout even when you are not sure what needs to happen.  This game deserves the praise it gets.","July 18, 2015","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is fairly simple but some of the puzzles will give you a nice bit to chew on. Should give you about 3-6 hours to play through if you don't use a walkthrough, so be warned that it's a short, self-contained experience.\n\nBut what an experience that is. This game's atmosphere is excellent, ranging from mystifying to creepy as you explore the derelict ruins and secluded countryside. The game's environmental graphics, ambient sound effects, and haunting soundtrack round off an excellent presentation that will likely remain unrivalled for quite some time. The character models and animations are a bit standard-fare and, while not bad, stand out as average when compared to the rest. The voice acting is fairly good, especially from the main character, whose voice provides occasional narration to the story.\n\nIf you've ever wondered what would happen if you blended some Twin Peaks and a little bit of Silent Hill and had an occult investigator serve as the protagonist, and then poured it into a nice cup of game: this game is for you.","July 2, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It offers no real replay value - while the story is presented in a non-linear manner where the only puzzle you need to complete before the others is all the puzzles before the last one, there is no variation. Only one solution for any given puzzle, and all puzzles must be completed to finish, leading to a sense of guide dangit if you bypass one of the early ones, which could be easy to do if you weren't coming the land. If you can tolerate a short and linear game for a vivid experience, I'd recommend it.\n\nThat is the only major complaint I have with the game - the plot is very good with an excellent ending, the narrator is pleasing to listen to ( although not as good as a Bastion ), the environments are fairly detailed with a sprinkling of places you can't enter as part of the plot railroad. The soundtrack is great, and the sound work is just as good. The graphics, while not the best in the world, are very well done and sell the setting.\n\nThe main puzzles are fairly simple, but interesting - you will be attempting to solve murders of people and must track down each clue before you enter a timeline where the events must be placed in the correct order ( which can lead to some guesswork as not all are clear until you get it wrong the first time ). The side missions are more varied - you chase an astronaut and go into space, you must navigate a house where all the doorways have portals in them, making them line up correctly to reach the wizard's protected room, and a few others.\n\nIf the developers were to release a TellTale-type chapters game following the mentioned but unelaborated previous cases of the player, Paul Prospero, I'd be all over that in a heartbeat, but the experience itself is worth a few bucks - certainly as much as you'd pay for a visual novel or light book - but not quite 10 dollars - once it reaches the 5 dollar mark it becomes worth it.","June 16, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not sure whether to recommend this game or not, but I can recognise the developers created something extraordinary here, and that at least deserved being mentioned.\n\nThis game is basically a walking simulator, but unlike for example The Stanley Parable, there are no alternate routes or endings. Replayability is non-existent here. Depending on how leisurely you play and how fast you resort to walkthroughs, you'll get about two to five hours out of this 'game'. In that sense you're probably thinking this game is overpriced, and I agree.\n\nI won't go into too much detail about the story, as that really is the meat of the game. I don't want to take away from that. But essentially, you are Paul Prospero, a detective with a keen eye for the supernatural, and you have come to Red Creek Valley per request of Ethan Carter's fanmail. As you solve murders and puzzles, the overarching plot reveals itself to you through cutscenes and voice-overs.\n\nThe way this works is you are dropped into a gorgeous, sprawling open-world with the clues scattered about. This is very reminiscent of point-and-click games, but the difference is you can actually (un)intentionally skip puzzles or scenes and walk further into the world. But to get the ending, you'll have to eventually solve every puzzle.\n\nTo summarize\n\nTop-notch visuals and music score make for a very eerie atmosphere. Easily the best part about the game.\nAbsolutely zero replayability. Best when played through in a single sitting in my opinion. Try keeping a spoiler-free walkthrough handy if you don't like the idea of wandering aimlessly until you bump into a clue.\nThe plot is alright to excellent, depending on your personal taste, but I don't think anyone can call it poor.\n\nIf you like games such as The Stanley Parable, Dear Esther, or are otherwise interested in video games as an art, definitely pick this up if you catch it on sale. I can best summarize this game as being dropped into a gorgeous but gloomy lovecraftian film which you can explore and walk around in.\n\nThat all being said, it's definitely not for everyone.

Once you solve your first major puzzle you will discover the pattern they take, but too often, the missing piece I needed to solve something was obscure, or worse, something I considered but just didn't do in the right order.\n\nNever the less, I enjoyed "The Vanishing of Ethan Carter."

The landscape and buildings seem to be of a time and place one can't easily pin down, though the setting is somewhere in the modern day USA. I was reminded of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. by lonely hills, forests, and tunnels that may or may not be haunted. The supernatural exploration detective game Betrayer comes to mind as well as the paranormal investigator protagonist combs the terrain for clues.\nThe story is hit or miss. I had a hard time buying into the story, but I was familiar with the type of tale being told. The incorporation of certain horror literature elements were rather well done but it was the interpersonal family dynamics that weren't as convincing as they could have been. The "twist" ending (depending on your point of view) wasn't very profound and the idea of ghosts "letting go" alternately fascinates and bores me. It was done reasonably well in Betrayer, dealing with cursed souls, and handled rather clumsily in Murdered: Soul Suspect, which over-relied on the concept.\nIf all that is appealing to you, buy the game at full price - it will be worth it.\nIf on the other hand, you're marginally interested in a game of a different pace than your usual frenetic adventure games, buy it on sale.

Though this is the first release by the newly formed developer they are built up of very experienced developers and The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter certainly passes off that vibe. The game plays out with you, Paul Prospero, walking throughout the small village of Red Creek Valley. The core of the game consists of you going through the town solving each murder mystery that the town has to offer, which is quite a few for such a small place. Since the core of the game is it’s story, I’m going to write this review without going into details on the story, so rest assured this review will remain spoiler free.\n\nSo like I said the game plays out as a first person mystery solver. The game begins with the text “This game is a narrative experience that does not hold your hand” and that is about the most definitive statement I can say about this game. The game is totally open world and will not give you any guides or hints about where to go or what to do. This is nice in the sense that you are totally free to explore the world and solve mysteries as you stumble upon them. As you explore you’ll notice items that seem to be missing from scenes. As you explore the world you’ll often find the missing items scattered around so that you can investigate and pick up the items. When you finish putting a scene back together you are able to open a portal into another dimension to explore and discover the secrets of what happened in the world. Exploring the story was interesting and though it felt like a good bit of the story didn’t quite fit in at the time of discovery, after further exploring and really examining the environments the pieces all came together. The story is really the reason to play the game. Their really isn’t much action, and you will spend almost all of your time exploring, examining and then walking to your next location.\n\nLuckily walking around the game world means you get to view more of the environments. The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter has possibly the best graphics I’ve ever seen in a video game. I mean the world is truly astonishing and is incredibly realistic. There were a number of times I actually had to stop playing, to admire the fact that what I was staring at was not a real life picture. And with the exception of one location, a mine, all were very unique yet realistic in their design. Not to say that the mine wasn’t well designed, but compared to the rest of the world the rocky maze like mine just seemed rather boring. The titles sound effects were not nearly as well done as the games graphics but quite honestly I found myself so indulged in the visuals of the game that I very rarely focused on the sound effects.\n\nFinally the ending of the game is one that I really enjoyed. The ending doesn’t explicitly say what happens one way or another. This works especially well because The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter leaves the story open to certain speculations. The end is left for you to sit, think about the events of the game and determine how it ends. Additionally the amount of small details you’ve paid attention to can actually have great effects on how you interpret things which can ultimately lead to an alternate view on the ending than you would have had otherwise. Unfortunately The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter is very short at roughly four to five hours to complete and because of the way the story plays out replay value is limited.\n\n8/10\n\nPROS\n• The best visuals seen in recent years\n• Small details that can effect the way you see the ending\n• Very well done open ended ending\n\nCONS\n• Story is only about 4-5 hours length\n• The design of the mine level","October 16, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It feels real. I mean really real, although it sounds kind of ridiculous. Well, at least when you do not look really closely. Wind is slowly swinging grass, tress, bushes and etc. Combining this with abandoned railroad and houses and, of course, mountain range environment the game creates feelings of lonelyness and melancholy. But after a few tens of minutes player will realise that something really weird is happening around there. Or maybe was happening...\n\nAfter this, the game will make you think. Not too hard, not too much. but still think... How to solve, where's the catch. Because the more you solve, the more story you'll uncover. And thus the game gets as interesting, as it is beautiful. And even if you won't be able to solve everything and leave some mysteries behind, you will still get to the very end of the game to see, to know what really happened there...\n\nAnd now i'll put aside my emotions and feelings and try to point out some pros and cons of this game.\n\nPros:\n-interesting story with a few or even none flaws in it;\n-breathtaking and detailed environment;\n-kind of empty but still alive world;\n-really good soundtrack;\n-simple game mechanics;\n-even more interesting when played with someone.\n\nObjective cons:\n-seems to be overpriced for its length;\n-later on the puzzles give you the feeling that they are a bit unfinished (at least some of them);\n-is really violent (I wouldn't recommend this for underaged or really sensitive people).\n\nSubjective cons:\n-puzzles were too easy for me with most of them taking like 5-7 minutes to solve them;\n-in my opinion, it would be great if the puzzles had a little different solution mechanics and would make you to think more;\n-i'm not sure if this was my machine but I had some minor lags and one bug that needed a game restart to be solved.\n\nFor the record, I played this with my girlfriend who isn't a fan of computer games. But she enjoyed this game a lot, loved the story, loved the time we spent for it.\n\nSo... This game is really worth to buy and play, even if it's short and overpriced. Want to buy a book with a good plot and sophisticated point of view towards the world? Do it... But consider this game as well, because it's almost as good as any of Stephen Kings' horror stories.\n\nShort update: in my review the time spent for this game is not shown correctly - with long strolls and taking time to enjoy the views this game took me about 6 hours to complete it with doing all the achievements.","April 13, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is the kind of game you think about after shutting your PC down and going to bed.\n\nDespite it being quite short (took me about 4 hours and I wandered around the map a bit) I spread my playthrough across 3 days. After the first session it felt like I played the game for a solid 3+ hours, when in fact I played only one. This game does walking around and exploring right, I can tell you that much. You WANT to see what the areas have to offer - the music and visuals are incredible but simple at the same time. The area itself is also very "dark" in some parts - enough to make it a horror game if only the devs wanted to go that way. Good thing they didn't, though. The ending was beautiful for me, open for interpretation and it just was a pleasure to see it like 5 more times after I finished - hearing the characters voices and the great end song.\n\nSlight spoiler here - I found / solved all of the 'quests' before reaching the end and it truly saddens me when I saw youtubers just rolling through the game, not wandering around, not exploring, etc. Shows you the current state of gaming, really. I will do a second playthrough to understand the story better - it's like a good movie, you see things differently the second time around.\n\nShout out to the Astronauts crew!

The story has a nice amount of Lovecraftian mythos sprinkled here and there, thumbs up for the ending. Takes about four hours to complete. However, if you don't take your time to look around you might miss something.\n\nAlthough the game world is very pretty, I felt I was more like gliding around instead of walking. Not being able to see your hands or feet or jump around in a first person game does not feel very immersive to me, especially in a walking simulator. But this is a minor detail. I enjoyed the game quite a bit.\n\n","June 15, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miker525/recommended/258520/","miker525","Miker525","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miker525/","400 products in account","The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter is a newly released mystery themed first person narration developed by indie developer The Astronauts. Though this is the first release by the newly formed developer they are built up of very experienced developers and The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter certainly passes off that vibe. The game plays out with you, Paul Prospero, walking throughout the small village of Red Creek Valley. The core of the game consists of you going through the town solving each murder mystery that the town has to offer, which is quite a few for such a small place. Since the core of the game is it’s story, I’m going to write this review without going into details on the story, so rest assured this review will remain spoiler free.\n\nSo like I said the game plays out as a first person mystery solver. The game begins with the text “This game is a narrative experience that does not hold your hand” and that is about the most definitive statement I can say about this game. The game is totally open world and will not give you any guides or hints about where to go or what to do. This is nice in the sense that you are totally free to explore the world and solve mysteries as you stumble upon them. As you explore you’ll notice items that seem to be missing from scenes. As you explore the world you’ll often find the missing items scattered around so that you can investigate and pick up the items. When you finish putting a scene back together you are able to open a portal into another dimension to explore and discover the secrets of what happened in the world. Exploring the story was interesting and though it felt like a good bit of the story didn’t quite fit in at the time of discovery, after further exploring and really examining the environments the pieces all came together. The story is really the reason to play the game. Their really isn’t much action, and you will spend almost all of your time exploring, examining and then walking to your next location.\n\nLuckily walking around the game world means you get to view more of the environments. The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter has possibly the best graphics I’ve ever seen in a video game. I mean the world is truly astonishing and is incredibly realistic. There were a number of times I actually had to stop playing, to admire the fact that what I was staring at was not a real life picture. And with the exception of one location, a mine, all were very unique yet realistic in their design. Not to say that the mine wasn’t well designed, but compared to the rest of the world the rocky maze like mine just seemed rather boring. The titles sound effects were not nearly as well done as the games graphics but quite honestly I found myself so indulged in the visuals of the game that I very rarely focused on the sound effects.\n\nFinally the ending of the game is one that I really enjoyed. The ending doesn’t explicitly say what happens one way or another. This works especially well because The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter leaves the story open to certain speculations. The end is left for you to sit, think about the events of the game and determine how it ends. Additionally the amount of small details you’ve paid attention to can actually have great effects on how you interpret things which can ultimately lead to an alternate view on the ending than you would have had otherwise. Unfortunately The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter is very short at roughly four to five hours to complete and because of the way the story plays out replay value is limited.\n\n8/10\n\nPROS\n• The best visuals seen in recent years\n• Small details that can effect the way you see the ending\n• Very well done open ended ending\n\nCONS\n• Story is only about 4-5 hours length\n• The design of the mine level","October 16, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is little to nothing in the way of action, and overall it plays more like a mystery or puzzle game than survival horror (though it has those elements as well). If you're looking for a shooter, or a fast-paced pulse pounding survival horror game, this isn't it.\n\nIt is, however, a masterfully executed, immersive, narrative experience reminiscent of Twin Peaks and the works of H.P. Lovecraft. The ways the player is given to interact with the environment and the story are both novel and intuitive, and the game has an unintrusive, minimal interface that fits well with the tone and theme of the game.\n\nI've been seeing this game compared to Dear Esther, which is a game I hate. Apart from generally seeming to have been constructed with more care, this game differs from Dear Esther in one very important, fundamental way: It gives the player things to do, and makes them feel like they are involved in the story. I felt a need to address this because the frequent comparisons between the two had caused me to avoid The Vanishing of Ethan Carter for quite some time. When I finally played it I was pleasantly surprised to find that this comparison does not hold up under scrutiny.","August 3, 2015","true","15.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well, after fourty odd minutes I had to quit the game, assuming the autosave feature would have triggered at some point, and on restarting... I'm right back at the beginning, with all progress lost.  Looking into this issue further on the forums, it is a common and very problematic issue for many people.  I don't want to have to sit and play a game for hours at a time every time; it isn't practical.\n\nThe devs are aware of this, however as of yet have done nothing to rectify it.  No manual save, or continuous autosave feature is ludicrous in 2015.  I have requested a refund from Steam as, for me, this game is just about unplayable as I am unable to commit to however many hours are needed each and every time I want to play.  I need the option of a brief twenty minutes on the occasion I don't have two hours spare.\n\nSuch a shame as what I did play was remarkable.

More effort could have been made to them and/or some features could have been removed to make it harder.\n\nThe story and game itself isn’t really that dark or scary either, except for this one puzzle who had this one zombie guardian you saw far behind you in one second, and when you turn around he suddenly spawns in front of you and kills you. I almost ♥♥♥♥ my pants multiple times.\n\nSo summed up, I got mixed feelings about this game. For the fact that I like how pretty this game is and not how easy it is.

I was hoping for a game with mystery, atmopshere, adventure, excitement, horror, paranormal, etc. This game was less than I expected. You basically spend the game walking around solving puzzles and searching giant environments for a few objects, just like other adventure games. There is really no player interaction and really any action at all. There is 1 tense/scary part and that is about it. The game feels quite empty.\n\nI did love the atmosphere. The visuals and feel of the area are some of the best I have ever seen, and this game was made for screenshots. The areas are varied and the graphics are decent. The crime solving can be fun sometimes with observations made by your character. Sometimes solving the order of events and finding objects can feel intuitive and you enjoy it. Other times the scenes used for the order involve a person standing there by themselves, or 1 scene has a new person none of the others do, and since it's just a still you cannot possibly gain an idea of what happened enough to put things in order. The game does this with clues. Sometimes you have to wonder off in a tiny area to find something. Like adventure games, if you don't find all the puzzles, and every object/clue and trigger every event, you can't beat the game. This means you'll prolly use a walkthrough, because of how big and open environements are, and there is no help from the game at all. The game says it doesn't "hold your hand" but in reality they are just being obtuse and  poor with some object placement and scene solving just to make it harder for no reason.\n\nThe game is short. The story is interesting to begin with and you are invested in what happens, and without spoiling anything, the ending is kind of a dud. So the best part of the game is the environment and visuals, with some interest from the story. The gameplay is the same ol boring item find/puzzle solve of an adventure game, with walkthrough needing for some parts, but does have a few new novel mechanics to use.","August 10, 2015","true","36.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are so many details to find and theories to craft that each player will get an experience of his own. The game mechanics are all solid enough to hold the game together and keep you interested through the whole journey. Sound and world design can compete with AAA titles, yet alone put many of them to shame. But the pacing and openness of the world also dictate your speed. The overall experience may last between 3-5h, and your mileage can vary greatly depending on your capability to find the important areas soon enough without getting frustrated.\n\nBut having finally reached the end you will feel a bit like an astronaut. You explored something completely new, and your experience, paths chosen and memories taken were your own. For me that is a clear characteristic of a great game.\n\nRead the full review here and look at tons of good screenshots[metadragon.de]","February 16, 2015","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Pieces don't fall in place until the end, and the outcome might leave the player emotionally unrewarded. Nonetheless it compresses the game's themes into a satisfying whole.\n\nThe story's hopefulness is its love letter to literature. It's the celebration of imagination and the naivistic nod to those who have tried to escape desolation in a dysfunctional family. It's the absence of absolute evil; Sleeper's function is not to frighten, it is to reflect our innermost needs.","November 29, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Thats it basically. Doesnt sound like much, I know.\nIts not even long. Somebody can finish it in 5 Hours.\nGlad that I bought it when it was on sale for 66% off because I wouldnt play the full price for such a short game, even if its good.\n\nTo sum some things up:\n\nPositive:\n- Amazing and beautiful graphics. Unreal Engine 3 on its limit, actually can mess with CryEngine if you ask me at least in this game. (Developers are working on a Unreal Engine 4 Version Update! Means it will probably look even better once!)\n- Great atmosphere (Sometimes a little bit spooky)\n- Interesting gameplay of solving puzzles\n- Much background of the story\n- Unique experience\n- Amazing and atmospheric Soundtrack\n\nNegatives:\n- Short\n- Gameplay is maybe a little bit flat for some folks. Dont expect any action or much to do in the game.\n- No instructions or tutorial how to solve cases. First time I played it I didnt even know that you can solve something...\nIf you cant make any progress ingame, you should try the Walkthrough guide which will explain how the game works and also shows you how to finish it.\n\nI can recommend the game if you look for a nice, atmospheric game experience and not for a action shooter or something. Since there is not much content and after 5 Hours you saw pretty much everything I would say grab it when its on sale. I can recommend the Collectors Edition upgrade, especially when you want the Soundtrack in extended and high quality FLAC format. The Soundtrack is amazing.

The landscape and buildings seem to be of a time and place one can't easily pin down, though the setting is somewhere in the modern day USA. I was reminded of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. by lonely hills, forests, and tunnels that may or may not be haunted. The supernatural exploration detective game Betrayer comes to mind as well as the paranormal investigator protagonist combs the terrain for clues.\nThe story is hit or miss. I had a hard time buying into the story, but I was familiar with the type of tale being told. The incorporation of certain horror literature elements were rather well done but it was the interpersonal family dynamics that weren't as convincing as they could have been. The "twist" ending (depending on your point of view) wasn't very profound and the idea of ghosts "letting go" alternately fascinates and bores me. It was done reasonably well in Betrayer, dealing with cursed souls, and handled rather clumsily in Murdered: Soul Suspect, which over-relied on the concept.\nIf all that is appealing to you, buy the game at full price - it will be worth it.\nIf on the other hand, you're marginally interested in a game of a different pace than your usual frenetic adventure games, buy it on sale. Either way, I'm confident it will be money well spent.","July 28, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ethan's letter brings Paul to the fictional Red Creek Valley, where Ethan's family resides. Already aware that Ethan is missing, Paul begins to explore Red Creek Valley and investigate its dark secrets...\n\nThe previous introduction to the story was copied and pasted from the game's wikipedia page since it compresses the story nicely. In my opinion the story was absolutely intriguing from start to finish. It kept me interested and wanting more. During the game you can see how it was inspired by H.P. Lovecraft. That fact gave me some nice cold shivers. The game left me with wanting more after the 4 hour long adventure. Even though 4 hours is a short time for a game, I think it was worth every second of it (you can pretty much beat the game in 2 hours if you know what you are doing).\n\nThe introduction should also give you an idea about what you are doing in this game. You investigate the happenings of Red Creek Valley to hopefully find the missing boy, Ethan Carter. The gameplay itself is pretty straightforward. You have to find missing objects and return them to where they originally were to reveal visions from the past. These visions will tell you what happened at certain places. That is the gameplay in a nutshell and it is actually very relaxing. At least most of the time.\n\nThis is where the game really surprised me. The graphics and the soundtrack. The game has some unbelievably gorgeous sceneries and buildings that look very unique and realistic. You can't just walk past them without staring for a moment or two. The soundtrack contains some well made music that will have you relaxed and sometimes on the edge of your seat.\n\nNutshell\nGameplay: 7/10\nGraphics: 10/10\nSounds and music: 8/10\nPerformance: 8/10\nStory: 8/10\nLength: 6/10\n\nConclusion\nThe Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a short yet an extraordinary game that will impress you with its graphics and enthrall you with an interesting story. I was eager to keep on going and I could've completed the game on one go, but I had other things to do. So if you are looking for a good story, graphics and soundtrack then this is the game for you. I just hope that the developers (The Astronauts) are planning on making more games like this. I bought this game from the summer sale of 2015. I feel like I robbed the damn studio.\n\n9/10\n"An adventure unlike any other"\n\nPlease let me know if I missed anything. You are also free to give me your own opinions! :)\n\nThank you","May 24","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a forsaken and gloomy place where tragic and mysterious events have unfolded which you have to put together piece by piece. Like in a good detective story, we have a narrator, the protagonist Paul Prospero himself, as he reflects on his previous cases and the little that he got to know from the letter from a boy called Ethan Carter. The storytelling is superb in this game, the scrip is very well written and the voice acting is true to life. Every sentence said carries a meaning and enhances the whole experience.\n\nNow, the thing that got me jumping off my stool with this game were the graphics. The beauty of the scenery is breathtaking. It's this lush overgrown countryside in early autumn where the trees have red and yellow leaves on them already but the weather still holds. All the time there's a light breeze which makes the trees and grass sway in a lazy manner and they found just the right sound to go with it. I could literally start sensing the odours of the countryside, that's how powerful the experience was.\n\nThe gameplay is simple but original. You interact with some items and pick up others but the way they're connected with the psychic abilities of Paul Prospero makes it a whole new experience. The puzzles are tough at times and need focus, I even made notes on sticky paper here and there to keep track, but at least they fall in the same box and have a sense of consistency to them.\n\nIf the beauty of scenery is something that matters to you then I highly recommend this game. If it doesn't, then it's still loaded with good puzzles and a kickass storytelling. Highly recommended.\n","August 2, 2015","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was not pleased with the unfriendly checkpoint autosave system, the general lack of clear instructions, and the linearity of the game (to trigger the autosave points) despite the game claiming it doesn't hold your hand. While I was very impressed with the beautiful graphics rendered on the Unreal Engine 3 and the game's use of music and ambient sounds to set the spine-chilling mood, I quickly gave up on it.\n\nThe Astronauts then tweaked the game based on gamers' feedback and updated it to run on Unreal Engine 4. I decided to give the game another chance, and I'm glad I did. The improvements that the designers made resulted in a more playable game, mainly because of a better autosave system. The claim of not holding the player's hand remains an issue for me because to me, in order to get the most out of the game narrative-wise, the player should solve all puzzles, perhaps even sequentially, so he/she can see how all events and character motivations fit together. Without some form of hand holding, looking for the next puzzle at times feels like looking for a needle in the haystack. If it weren't for a published walkthrough, I would have missed two sets of puzzles altogether.\n\nNitpicking aside, the revamped autosave system means no need to backtrack to save your game as in the original version, and that itself makes the redux version more playable and less infuriating to play. Furthermore, the graphics in the new version are GORGEOUS. Never have I spent so much time taking in-game screenshots. Thank goodness 'Ethan Carter' is full of quiet moments that allow you to soak in its gorgeous vistas.\n\n'The Vanishing of Ethan Carter' turns out to be more supernatural than I anticipated. It feels tonally inconsistent at first, but as the player unravels more of the mystery, this inconsistency starts to make sense even thought one particular scary part sticks out like a sore thumb gameplay-wise. Overall, 'The Vanishing of Ethan Carter Redux' feels and plays like a really good M. Night Shyamalan movie, and it has won me over with the improvements the developers have made. I highly recommend those who gave up on the original like I did to give the game another try.","August 29, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

You play Paul Prospero, a paranormal detective answering fan mail from one Ethan Carter, a 12 year from Red Creek Village, WI. When you arrive, you realize something is awry as you find a railcar with blood sprayed on the front and a pair of legs not far behind it. The rest of the corpse is nearby. Now you get to investigate and look into the dark world of the Carter family and you start to realize just how insane they are. Without spoiling anything, let me just say that the further you progress, the more you'll realize about what's really going on.\n\nOn the technical side of things, the graphics are stunning. I mean, perhaps some of the best graphics in a video game I've seen to date. The atmosphere is, as stated, eerie. The plant and tree life are highly detailed. The water looks amazing. Basically, everything looks amazing. Even the sun, you don't get terrible sun shafts, instead the sun shines naturally, it's great. Gameplay is rather simple, you explore for clues and put together pieces while uncovering memories.\n\nI really liked this game. It's short, but once you uncover everything, it's kind of shocking, but at the same time not that surprising.\n\n9.2/10","August 20, 2015","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chronicles5/recommended/258520/","chronicles5","chronicles5","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chronicles5/","335 products in account","I can't recommend this game highly enough. Let me start with the only negative thing I can say about this game - it's too short. Actually, for the story, the length of the game is just right - I only wish I could have spent 2-3x as much time in this world, an experience for which I would have gladly paid top dollar. My play time was about 6 hours, which included my scouring every corner of the island to ensure I didn't miss anything. Next I'll move on to the obvious - the game is visually stunning. Few titles can compare. My understanding is that the devs used a new technique to create hyperrealistic textures and objects, and their work has paid off unbelievably - resulting in a huge open world that you feel you could reach out and touch. I hope to play this using Oculus Rift someday. The controls are simple and intuitive and your character is only limited in his exploration of the world by a sense of realism - for the most part, he will not venture any further than you reasonably could in real life.The audio is incredible, weaving natural ambience in with a moving and haunting soundtrack that flows perfectly as you move from one location to the next. And the locations are a sight to behold. Any moment of this game would make a gorgeous postcard, and the overall layout of the island is very well thought-out. There may be some backtracking, depending on how observant you've been, but it's hard to complain, considering how beautiful the walk will be.\n\nAs you move deeper into the village, the story captures your attention and pulls you through to the end. The story is primarily a murder mystery, but blends many aspects of occult and science fiction in to good effect - and if you pay attention, all will make sense at the end. For the most part, the gameplay is very simplistic, but there are a couple of puzzling moments that will make you think, and a decent scare or two. If you watched a gameplay vid and were concerned that all the puzzles would work that way, I can tell you that's not the case. One puzzle stood out as my clear favorite, the one involving doors, and I won't say any more than that to ensure I don't spoil it for you. The investigations are also very interesting, if a bit simplistic. But simplistic is a welcome change for this gamer, who sometimes tires of hunting for dozens of odd items in adventure/mystery games and trying to make sense of them. There is none of that here - this game challenges you to think in different ways. Once you've unraveled all of the mysteries, the story comes to a surprising conclusion, which personally I found to be a satisfying explanation and resolution for the strange events that have taken place on this island.\n\nOverall, I feel that this game resonates with me personally as an example of what I am looking for in gaming these days. This is a visceral experience that requires some thought, and rewards you handsomely for your efforts.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chronicles5/recommended/258520/","chronicles5","chronicles5","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chronicles5/","335 products in account","I can't recommend this game highly enough. Let me start with the only negative thing I can say about this game - it's too short. Actually, for the story, the length of the game is just right - I only wish I could have spent 2-3x as much time in this world, an experience for which I would have gladly paid top dollar. My play time was about 6 hours, which included my scouring every corner of the island to ensure I didn't miss anything. Next I'll move on to the obvious - the game is visually stunning. Few titles can compare. My understanding is that the devs used a new technique to create hyperrealistic textures and objects, and their work has paid off unbelievably - resulting in a huge open world that you feel you could reach out and touch. I hope to play this using Oculus Rift someday. The controls are simple and intuitive and your character is only limited in his exploration of the world by a sense of realism - for the most part, he will not venture any further than you reasonably could in real life.The audio is incredible, weaving natural ambience in with a moving and haunting soundtrack that flows perfectly as you move from one location to the next. And the locations are a sight to behold. Any moment of this game would make a gorgeous postcard, and the overall layout of the island is very well thought-out. There may be some backtracking, depending on how observant you've been, but it's hard to complain, considering how beautiful the walk will be.\n\nAs you move deeper into the village, the story captures your attention and pulls you through to the end. The story is primarily a murder mystery, but blends many aspects of occult and science fiction in to good effect - and if you pay attention, all will make sense at the end. For the most part, the gameplay is very simplistic, but there are a couple of puzzling moments that will make you think, and a decent scare or two. If you watched a gameplay vid and were concerned that all the puzzles would work that way, I can tell you that's not the case. One puzzle stood out as my clear favorite, the one involving doors, and I won't say any more than that to ensure I don't spoil it for you. The investigations are also very interesting, if a bit simplistic. But simplistic is a welcome change for this gamer, who sometimes tires of hunting for dozens of odd items in adventure/mystery games and trying to make sense of them. There is none of that here - this game challenges you to think in different ways. Once you've unraveled all of the mysteries, the story comes to a surprising conclusion, which personally I found to be a satisfying explanation and resolution for the strange events that have taken place on this island.\n\nOverall, I feel that this game resonates with me personally as an example of what I am looking for in gaming these days. This is a visceral experience that requires some thought, and rewards you handsomely for your efforts. It also represents a great effort to imagine new types of gameplay, which I feel was very successful. I look forward to playing this game again some day, and I hope to see many more titles from these developers in the future. 9/10","September 28, 2014","true","9.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

If that sounds appealing, you'll likely love this game.  However, it should be noted that the game DOES have exactly one area with a real, traditional, troll-approved monster roaming around.  It's an unpleasant desgin choice, given how well the rest of the game is tailored to the exact sort of player who would hate that.  On the other hand, if this is a concern of yours, please note that you can easily look up the details of this in advance.  (Not immediately.  The game itself will quite directly warn you when it's time to do so.  Spoilers can be kept to an absolute minimum.)  If you do research the area before heading in, the challenge of avoiding the monster is fairly minimal.  I did exactly that and never "died."

But this game needed more of these moments to further build the protagonist and to keep the audience intrigued in mystery.

In games of this genre I'm most interested in getting a interesting story, enough game mechanics to not make me snore and a stellar locations to give those art-loving eyes some enjoyment. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter only provides the latter.\n\nGraphics and music are jaw-dropping. Attention to detail, pretty foliage, carefully crafted assets, textures and lighting... This game really pushes Unreal Engine 3 up to V-Max. If you are coming into this game for visual feast alone, I could recommend this game for you. Still, I personally cannot give such an easy pass to story and gameplay.\n\nI was expecting a great, thrilling, paranormal murder and investigation story and basically I got one, but I'm not really satisfied. Plot starts of really interesting, but it plays out most of it's cards too quickly, to the point where it all starts to feel really cliche. The straw that broke the camels back however, is the ending which both explains and justifies many of my complains but in the extremely clumsy and unsatisfying way. Voice-overs are rare, pacing is solid, but not great and environmental storytelling is bare-bones. Overall, story department is the place where this game seriously drops the ball.\n\nGameplay is only a bit better. Thank heavens that this "walking simulator" gives you some proper  puzzles. This is very refreshing - they tried to give you some agency in the game and for the most part they succeed. You don't really feel were that you are on the interactionless excursion. Unfortunately, the novelty and variety of problems and puzzles seriously drops down in later parts of the game. Mechanics are samey, there aren't any "gameplay twists" or new mechanics. That results in gameplay that tried, but didn't hold my attention through whole journey...\n\n4 hour journey... This game isn't really worth a asking price. I got it for equivalent of 6 bucks and I'm not really feeling that I will return to this game anymore for story or gameplay. Sure, there is a Redux version with new Unreal Engine 4 and I will check it out for visuals alone, but If you are not into watching and exploring a beautiful virtual landscapes, there isn't anything other noteworthy about this game.

It is beautiful, has a great setting and atmosphere, and have puzzles and detective bits that may stump you for a bit, but they're ultimately fairly doable.\n\nYou walk around the location searching for clues to solve the deaths of Ethan's family members. Backtracking is not a requirement, but if you somehow miss out on solving a murder or a puzzle, you can just backtrack. It seems vast, but on the overall the location is not that big. It may get a bit off-putting if you end up having to backtrack many times.\n\nI would say it should take the average gamer 4-5 hours to complete the game. If you manage to "go with the flow" and solve everything fairly straightforwardly, you could finish the game in around 3 hours.\n\nThe game mechanics are fine. First, you need to find all items at the murder scene, then tag them in the order in which they happened. Some trial and error may be required for certain scenes.\n\nI think it's a fairly decent game. There could have been more things to do, since the map does seem a bit large for what there is in the game. Another thing is that the mouse feels very floaty. It seems like there is a lot of weight attached to it.\n\nMy biggest complaint though is that the game stutters like nobody's business. You can confirm this by just looking into the forums. Whatever settings I choose, I get stutters every 5-10 seconds or so. For a game that primes itself on the atmosphere and setting, this is a real deal breaker.\n\nAnother thing is that this game is extremely graphically intensive. Even on the lowest possible settings, I get mid 40fps when I am in the middle of trees. And basically every other part of the game has trees. Basides, many graphics settings like Ambient Occlusion and FXAA do not seem to work.\n\nI would recommend this game for those who don't mind something slower paced, or just want to take in the breathtaking visuals.

The less I know the more I'll be surprised by the actual content of the game. Unfortunately the only surprise I felt was that I was suckered into paying 20 bucks for a 4 hour game.\n\nWhile the first 1/3 of the game shows a lot of potential with the introduction of a unique crime scene gameplay mechanic, interesting mystery and one fantastic puzzle, the game never evolves beyond this point and becomes incredibly closed-in despite what the environments try to convince you.\n\nSECOND WARNING! SPOILERS BELOW!\n\nI'll summarize briefly, but the story is your character, Paul Prospero, has received a disturbing fan letter from a boy named Ethan Carter. Concerned that Ethan is in grave danger, Paul arrives at Red Creek Valley to investigate. Along the way you begin to unravel the events surrounding the murders of Ethan's family members, as well as exploring the depths of Ethan's imagination through his story pages.\n\nWhat's disappointing is the ending doesn't really have the emotionally gripping payoff I think the developers were hoping for. To put it simply, Ethan Carter in his (possibly) final moments while trapped in a room during a house fire, has imagined the entire scenario, including your main character Paul Prospero.\n\nInstead of being pulled into that ending emotionally, I was left thrown out of it asking "ok, then why did these imaginary murders occur the way they did?" Beyond the idea that Ethan Carter hated his abusive and resentful family, the way each family member are killed doesn't really say anything in particular about how Ethan related to each of them.\nThe potential was there, cause the scenarios surrounding Ethan's story pages have great imagery that really keep you in suspsense and feel connected to the ending, but the murder scenarios lack this and feel like they occurred the way they did "just cause." This wouldn't have been such a big issue with me except these scenarios were a big part of the story and ultimately wasted otherwise well-handled characters (Particularly due to the voice actors and what the player learns about them through reading material).\n\nAlso, apparently the idea for good symbolism for a particular murder scene was to just throw Crow's all over the place. So not only did they use an overrused concept, but it was done in the most generic and casual way possible.\n\nMy final gripe is the price tag. Charging players 20 dollars for a four hour game? Nothing short of ridiculous. Maybe there could of been more content and depth to the story if the majority of the game's time and resources weren't devoted to its environment, which to no surprise looks great.\n\nSo to put it simply, I think the big issue for me came down to the handling of the story. Unfortunately, Since this game is essentially a sight-seeing tour with a few gameplay mechanics dispersed here and there along the narrative, the story was very much a make-or-break factor in this game, and it just doesn't live up to its potential.\n\n\n\n\n","September 28, 2014","false","4.2"," 19 of 37 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","19","37","0","0"

Throughout the whole game you are left to your own devices to investigate several murders and solve several puzzles which you are also left to find on your own in actually quite a vast world for a game of this size, with this aim.\n\nThe horror of this game does not lie in its gore, or its jump scares (of which there are a few - but not enough to put off you that do not enjoy a jump scare) it lies in the game's atmosphere, and is for the most part a psychological horror story. The atmosphere of this game is tagible and thoroughly enjoyable - like reading a bloody good book, you will feel more than compelled to journey on through the mysterious past of Red Creek Valley.\n\nThis is a game that I have played through twice and I am still in awe of the beautiul Autumnal landscape that the producers have created. It will leave you guessing right up until the end, which you will not want to arrive at. This is why I play games. Money well spent.

I'm a huge psychological anime fan and occult mystery lover, so I fit right into the story telling and the fact that I was a "famous occult detective" that was asked to investigate "The Vanishing of Ethan Carter" made it catch me from the opening sequence. Also honestly if you're good at deducing a mystery (like a detective *hint hint*) then the things fall into place and start to give you that mystery solving satisfaction as if you're slowly solving the murder mystery of the century!\n\nBeyond the whole I <3 mystery part,\n\nThe game scores an 8 out of 10 with me\n\nPro's\n\n- Graphics are beautiful, I'm on med graphics and still felt compelled to take screenshots\n- The mystery kept me wondering what is the cause? How will it end?!\n- Gameplay is a welcomed change from the recent norm. No blaring markers saying "ITEM HERE! DROP OFF HERE!"\n- Environment felt stressful and edgy yet mysterious and relaxing all at the same time\n- Soundtrack is mysterious as well\n\nCon's\n\n- It is pretty short if you rush it, I can counter argue it with the brain wrapping and speculation you can give it... But it still is a pretty short game.\n- Is confusing sometimes, if you are quick to get frustrated or don't have allot of time, maybe consider passing on this one or going in with a guide.\n- Still coming out with regular updates and fixes, I feel as though it's a one play game and I may be wrong if they make more stories based around the universe and release it. But once I'm done I don't think I am going to come back unless to re-live the mystery gameplay when I get nostalgic.\n- Characters feel distant unless you can get into the story and piece together who they are and what they are doing. Like I said before, maybe not a game for someone who doesn't really piece information together creatively and decisively.\n\n\nWith all that said I really loved this game myself and will be looking forward to more work like this, pick it up and give it a try if you wanna play something a little more on the out there side!","December 25, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The landscape is just mindblowing and forced me to stop and just look at it on more than one occasion. The fact that you don't have a UI makes this even better since a lot of times you have your screen look like a picture.\nGameplay: I really enjoyed solving every single puzzle/mystery that was thrown at me by this game. Usually games like this one force you down a very linear path. In this game you can, at least to some extent, solve the puzzles in no particular order and even just walk around the amazing Red Creek Valley.\nSound: Some games that have horror elements in them sometimes overdo it with the "scary" sounds. In TVOEC it had just the right music and sounds to keep me at the edge of my seat and not be annoyed about it.\nStory/Narration: The story had me hooked until the very end of the game. If you like mystery novels than you will enjoy this game a lot. One thing that stood out for me in particular was the narration that helped the story a lot.\nAtmosphere: All of the above mentioned points add to this games astoundingly amazing atmosphere. While playing TVOEC I got this feeling that you sometimes get when you read a good book and you just emerge yourself into the world and story of that book. What I did not like\nSaving system: Luckily enough I played through the whole game in one go but in TVOEC you cannot save manually. Instead it saves automatically from time to time. Unfortunately those times can be quite far appart and if you have to leave your PC you may lose quite a bit of your progress.\nPrice: As much as I love this game and for me it was worth every cent (I bought it on sale), I personally think it's a little to expensive considering it is not the longest of games.\nConclusion\nThe Vanishing of Ethan Carter is definitely one of the best games I've played. Since the issues with the automatic saving didn't really affect me I have nothing negative to say about the game. Having played through it now I probably also would pay the full price of the game.

Absolutely jaw-dropping gorgeous. The story might follow the same beats as a number of other pieces of "weird" fiction, but to call it cliche(as I've heard many do) is kind of nuts. The template is there, sure, but in that template are fairly well-acted and interesting characters. If you're the completionist sort, the kind that wanders around and finds everything, then this game is exactly for you. If you tend to rush from story point to story point, I'd advise caution, as there are wonderful tucked away set pieces that, sadly, you'll have to backtrack for if you don't find them the first time.\n\nBut seriously: Gorgeous. One to show off your graphics card/have your friends oooh and aaah at.

It's also one of the best games that I've played in a long time.\n\nIt's not often that a game like this releases. A game in which you know nothing about, and how others don't want you to know what it's about. You just need to play it on your own and have your own experience with it. Like I said, these kinds of games rarely ever come out. Last year’s example of this kind of game would be 'Gone Home', or in 2012, 'Dear Esther'. I'd strongly recommend playing this game for yourself before reading this.\n\nOne of the things that got me the most excited about this game was its opening scene. When you start, you'll get a black screen with this simple line of text: "This game is a narrative experience that does not hold your hand." This line really is true, because the game just drops you in the middle of a gorgeous world to explore. You'll play as the protagonist Paul Prospero, a detective. Throughout the game he'll talk to himself about the surroundings and hints of what to do next. But honestly, I wish this was different.\n\nThe game has a story, yes. One where a series of crimes have centered around the Carter family, and you are sent to investigate. Where the game doesn't hold your hand, you are left to just wander until you find floating lines of text which are the "clues" to the investigation. Honestly, I didn't know what these were, and I continued to aimlessly collect them until I found the final act. I understand that this is the story of the game, but it just felt... odd. All I wanted to do was explore the environment. I'd still play this game if that's all it had to offer. The world in this game is pretty big (not as in like Skyrim big, though) and it's beyond beautiful. The lighting and textures are some, if not the most beautiful graphics I've ever seen in a video game before. It felt almost too lifelike. Most of my time with the game I wandered taking screenshots of the world (check out my screenshots library, I took way too much) and then taking part in the story.\n\nThe story, after you find these clues, shows how some supernatural being basically brainwashed the Carter family into killing each other. After you witness the ghostly reenactments of these deaths, you get one step closer to finding where Ethan Carter is. That is, until you reach the ending. I won't say what happens in the ending, that's for you to see. But where it wrapped up in the end, I started to appreciate more of what the story was trying to tell. It was almost touching in a way. The story wasn't nearly as good and drawn out as say, Gone home, but it was interesting to say the least.\n\nAs I mentioned, I sort of almost wished the story wasn't included in this game, but in the end I'm happy with the outcome. But just the aspect of wandering and exploring is enough for me to want to play it again and again. I wish that someday we could all get a game as beautiful as this on the scale of an Elder Scrolls game. For the price of $20, I feel it was well worth spent. It almost feels like a bargain for how good it was. Don't be surprised if you see this on my top 10 games of 2014 list, because it definitely deserves a spot in there.\n\nOverall, I'd give this a solid 8/10.\n","October 15, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The surronding forests accompanied with the little to no sound but trees leaves rustling in the wind and the odd piece of music every now and again help make you feel that while the place appears like any other forest area there is something beneath all that, that feels wrong and wierd, this caused me to constantly look around my enviroment as I played thinking something was watching my every move but as Paul says at the beginning of the game "No place is truely quiet and Nowhere is really Oridinary".\nBecause of this the overall feel and look of the game is very lovecraftian with the odd town and it's strange residents believing in some unseen possibly evil entity and occult minded individuals getting roped into the events.\nThe gameplay simply consists of you exploring the surronding areas of Red Creek Valley and investigating the series of murders that have place.\nThe first instance of this happens minutes into the game with you noticing blood on a nearby traincar, this then leads you to using your supernatural abilities to locate a crank to start the train, but before finding the crank you notice a blood trail that leads to a body and from there you look around the nearby area for clues as to how this person ended up in this state.\nGraphics wise The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is stunning to say the least, it lead to more suprise to find that it ran on Unreal Engine 3 and as I say this I will probably get bombarded with "X game looks better" or "I've seen better Unreal Engine games" but this game is probably the best use I've seen of the engine to date.\nThe audio side is also very well done with the soundtrack consisting of piano and violins that put you into a deep and methodical trance which is fitting considering you're a detective.\nAs I finishing The Vanishing of Ethan Carter I can say that I was pleasantly suprised and will probably make this one of my top games of the year.\nThis game left me with more questions than answers which some might not take to kindly too but I feel that it is rather fitting for a mystery that there are somethings left to unanswered and only for our imagination fill in.","September 28, 2014","true","6.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The surronding forests accompanied with the little to no sound but trees leaves rustling in the wind and the odd piece of music every now and again help make you feel that while the place appears like any other forest area there is something beneath all that, that feels wrong and wierd, this caused me to constantly look around my enviroment as I played thinking something was watching my every move but as Paul says at the beginning of the game "No place is truely quiet and Nowhere is really Oridinary".\nBecause of this the overall feel and look of the game is very lovecraftian with the odd town and it's strange residents believing in some unseen possibly evil entity and occult minded individuals getting roped into the events.\nThe gameplay simply consists of you exploring the surronding areas of Red Creek Valley and investigating the series of murders that have place.\nThe first instance of this happens minutes into the game with you noticing blood on a nearby traincar, this then leads you to using your supernatural abilities to locate a crank to start the train, but before finding the crank you notice a blood trail that leads to a body and from there you look around the nearby area for clues as to how this person ended up in this state.\nGraphics wise The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is stunning to say the least, it lead to more suprise to find that it ran on Unreal Engine 3 and as I say this I will probably get bombarded with "X game looks better" or "I've seen better Unreal Engine games" but this game is probably the best use I've seen of the engine to date.\nThe audio side is also very well done with the soundtrack consisting of piano and violins that put you into a deep and methodical trance which is fitting considering you're a detective.\nAs I finishing The Vanishing of Ethan Carter I can say that I was pleasantly suprised and will probably make this one of my top games of the year.\nThis game left me with more questions than answers which some might not take to kindly too but I feel that it is rather fitting for a mystery that there are somethings left to unanswered and only for our imagination fill in.","September 28, 2014","true","6.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I don't think I would've paid more.\n\nThat said, this game should be called Nature Photography Simulator 2014 because there is no game that has had me reaching for the F12 screenshot button so much before. I've taken over 40 screenshots within my 6 hours of gameplay. It's just so beautiful to walk around and look at all of it! It could also be called a Graphical Benchmarking Software: The Video Game.\n\nRegarding the gameplay, the murder solving mechanics and storytelling techniques here are top notch. Really entertaining. I had my entire family sitting around the TV trying to piece together the clues to each crime scene.\n\nIt's NOT a terribly long game, but as this game says at the very beginning, it will not hold your hand. You're free to roam the entirety of Red Creek Valley without any guidance. So unless you look up a guide, you could very well get many hours out of this.\n\nDon't expect too much of a challenge however, this game is not super difficult. But it is an enjoyable narrative experience for anyone that likes a good story that keeps you guessing, and amazing scenery.\n\nEDIT: After playing the game a little longer, I can confirm that NO, you cannot travel to any place you can see. So there are some boundaries to this beautiful world.","December 26, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The environment is obviously gorgeous and the graphics are astounding for a 20$ open world title, the soundtrack fits the tone perfectly and the atmosphere is both eery and peaceful. The few gameplay elements and puzzles involved are implemented well and don't break the flow of the game at all, it's all very immersive and the detective bits are fun to go through and are solved using sense and logic making it all seem very grounded.\n\nThe storyline is where I found the game to shine though, it's very HP Lovecraft-esque and those familiar with his work will immediately notice similarities. Clues and information are often discovered out of order and you'll find yourself confused most of the time, struggling to put more and more outlandish facts together into a cohesive story.

With a huge twist, the way the game was written demonstrates how much power and creativity your a person's ideas and thoughts can have. I wont even get started on how well the game looks, well designed environments beautifully crafted in everywhere, it almost felt to me that this place actually existed somewhere in the world and hi, it might. I have played many games and for many years and i had never had experienced i had with this one, this is a must try you won't be disappointed. This game will grab you and not let go.","April 2, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
