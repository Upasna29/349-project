"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteblade999/recommended/367500/","Whiteblade999","Amn Nom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteblade999/","322 products in account","Imagine you are playing a melee character fighting a giant griffon. There aren't many options because you have no ranged weapons and no way to stay on it for an extended period of time. Then you remember a Griffon has feathers. Feathers are flammable. So you do what any sensible Arisen would do, you light yourself on fire when the Griffon lands. Then you dive onto the Griffon as it takes to the sky. It covers a decent distance before you climb over to a wing and set it aflame. This causes the Griffon to crash into the ground. Now the playing field is even. You promptly deal with the grounded Griffon.\n\nAnother scenario where a Cyclops is staring down at you. You aren't strong enough to take on this Cyclops, it will tear you to shreds. Not wanting to look like a scrub you dive onto it. You poke the Cyclops eye so it can't see. The Cyclops starts flailing around. You see a nearby cliff. You proceed to force said Cyclops to run right off the cliff and let gravity do the rest of the work.\n\nA final scenario where I'm a Sorcerer. The game has been easy. I make anything I come across my ♥♥♥♥♥ by calling down a meteor shower or giant tornado. Then I come across a golem as it starts to get dark. I try magic on it and realize it is mostly immune. Well, ♥♥♥♥. The best I can do is draw the battle out to try and get a lucky meteor hit on the cores that are the only damageable place on the golem. When I have exhausted all the spots that meteors can hit I start to panic. Then I realize I can melee. I unequipped my staff for the first time in the entire game and proceeded to climb on the back of the golem punching the last two or three cores. It took me ♥♥♥♥ing ages but he eventually went down as the sun rose.\n\nDragon's Dogma is a game of small moments that add up to make one of the best action games ever.","January 15","true","19.2"," 1,115 of 1,166 people (96%) found this review helpful 369 people found this review funny","96","115","1","369","43"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198124066405/recommended/367500/","76561198124066405","Commander Shrekard","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198124066405/","69 products in account","Let me just start by saying that Dragon's Dogma is one of my favorite games of all time. I clocked in countless hours on the ps3 version. It is a wonderful RPG, but it has its flaws, so I'll try to do it justice.\n\n\nIn Dragon's Dogma, you are the Arisen, who must kill a dragon. You are joined by the Pawns, strange creatures that look like humans, but lack their will. more detailed aspects of the game are explained below.\n\nIs the port good?\nThe port is indeed good. There are no game breaking bugs so far through what I have played. My computer isn't too powerful, but it runs at a good framerate, and the graphics look fine. Speaking of graphics...\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics for this game are decent for a ps3 and xbox 360 game. They aren't the most beautiful, but they also aren't the ugliest. Even at the highest settings the game isn't going to get much better. They get the job done though.\n\nStory\nThe story of Dragon's Dogma is definitly the weakest point in the game. I personally find it interesting enough, but for you gamers who absolutely NEED a spectacular story, I say don't pick this up. To put the story bluntly, you fight a dragon. That's the main point, though the story gets more interesting at the end,  SPOILER  because after you kill the dragon, you kill god, become god, and then kill yourself to stop the cycle.\nAll the "main" quests you do lead up to the final encounter, but only in the sense that you do them and then the story progresses.\nThe voice acting in the game is also not the best. I don't think it's terrible as some people say, but it could be better. Again, only adequate.\n\nCombat\nCombat is the main draw of this game. The combat system is sort of like a hack and slash game, but there's more to it than that. You can grab onto enemies, both big and small. Regarding small enemies, when you stun or knock them down, you can take that opportunity to grab them yourself, or hope your pawn grabs them, leaving them vulerable to extra damage from the rest of the party. When grappling big enemies, you climb them Shadow of the Colossus style. Climb to their weakpoint for massive damage, but be careful not to be shaken or knocked off.\nYou also have access to various skills to be used in fights.\n\nThere are nine available classes, called Vocations, in the game,  There are six standard classes to be equipped on either the pawn or Arisen. There are also three hybrid classes unique to the Arisen. Each class has various skills to unlock, but can only equip so many at a time and must be changed at specific places. Some skills when unlocked for one class can be used for other classes as well. Each class also can only equip certain pieces of armor.\n\n\nFighter: This is your standard melee class. Equipped with a sword in the main hand and a shield in the off hand, this class is best at guarding against attacks, then unleashing its own. The Fighter has access to any three sword skills, and any three shield skills, totalling six.\n\nWarrior: This melee class is the hard hitter. Equipped with only a two handed greatsword or hammer, this class can unleash devastating blows, but can not block against them. Unfortuneately, this class only has access to three weapon skills, making it the least varied class.\n\nStrider: This is your standard rogue class. Equipped with two daggers and a shortbow, this class excells at short range. It should be noted that the shortbow deals more damage the closer the target is, and that the Strider is better suited using its daggers for combat. The Strider has access to unlimited regular arrows, and limited special arrows. This class can equip three dagger skills, and three shortbow skills, totalling six.\n\nRanger: This is a Strider who trades some dagger skills for a longbow and ranged prowess. The longbow is more powerful than the shortbow, has greater ranged, and also does more damage to further targets, but fire slower. Ranger skills are centered around sniping far away enemies.  The Ranger has access to unlimited regular arrows, and limited special arrows. This class can equip three dagger skills, and three longbow skills, totalling six.\n\nMage: This is your standard, well, mage class. The mage is equipped with a staff and has access to various offensive and defensive spells, leading to a balanced spell caster. Besides spells, the mage can also fire magic bolts as a standard attack, or slowly swing the their staff. The mage can equip six spells at a time.\n\nSorcerer: This is a mage who specializes purely in offensive spells. They are equipped with an archstaff, which replaces the swing with a close range energy blast. The sorcerer can equip six spells at a time.\n\nMystic Knight: A hybrid class, a mix of a Mage and Fighter. This class can be thought of as a Fighter with some magic abilities. The Mystic Knight can equip either their exclusive mace, a sword, or a mage's staff with a few spells in their main hand. In the off hand is the Magick Shield. This blocks as well as a Fighter's shield, but with the added bonus of harming attackers when blocking with perfect timing. It can also cast spells to enhance the users shield or weapon. This class can equip three shield spells, three weapon skills/spells, and three staff spells when equipped with one, totalling six skills/spells at any moment\n\nAssassin: A hybrid class, a mix of a Fighter and Strider. This is the most versatile class, able to equip daggers or a sword, combined with a shield or a bow. As long a player holds them, they can swich at any time. The Assassin has similar skills to a Fighter and Strider, as well as its own unique skills. This class can equip three skills for each weapon, totalling  six at any given time\n\nMagick Archer: A hybrid class, a mix of a Strider and Mage. Self explanatory. This class uses a magick bow to shoot unlimited magick arrows as well as cast spells in the form of special arrows. The class can also equip daggers, with some unique skills, or a staff with a few spells. This class can equip three skills on each weapon, totalling six at any given time.\nThese can be changed at will at two certain places, leading to extraordinary variety.\nI can't possibly explain everything about the combat, It's something you must experience.\n\nOther things to note\nThough competent, the Pawn AI is not always the best at exploiting openings. You can also tell them to shut up in the options menu if they get on your nerves.\nSome assembly is required in the fast travel system. You must place Portcrystals around the world (up to 10 I believe) then use a ferrystone to teleport there. There is an eternal ferrystone with infinite uses at any inn storage. Don't lose it.\nNew game plus is both good and bad. Good if you want to go through the game absolutely destroying almost everything, bad if you were hoping it would get harder. There is the Ur Dragon though.\nBitterblack Isle, what makes this game the Dark Arisen version, is much, much different than the base game, and also harder. enjoy at your own risk\nThis wraps up my review. These are all the points I could think of to comment about the game. Overall, I give it an 8/10. It is a game with its flaws, but I think it makes up for them with its positives. I highly recommend this game to everyone.","January 17","true","24.4"," 548 of 579 people (95%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","95","548","579","15","11"

Not only was the void filled, but my inner child was awakened.\n\n......AND.........\n\nTHE COMBAT MECHANICS ARE AMAZEBALLS.\n\nThis game is like the open world of Skyrim with combat mechanics superior to what you find in Dark Souls, and that's not even scratching the surface.\n\nThe truth is: Dragon's Dogma is its own thing, and it is absolutely WONDERFUL. It is, hands down, my favorite RPG of all time. It hits that magic Goldilocks spot for me: juuuust right.\n\nDRAGON'S DOGMA HAS:\n• Challenging, diverse AI. You'll forget it's AI at points.\n• Challenging open world boss fights that rival Dark Souls.\n• Incredibly fluid, not-clunky movement mechanics.\n• AMAZING dungeons that awaken the kid inside.\n• A super-massive and gorgeous open world that feels alive.\n• Winding trails, waterfall caves, hidden crags and endless exploration.\n• Parkour mechanics that feel solid, not gimmicky.\n• Crazy amounts of charm.\n• Rich lore that is part of the world, not spoonfed to you via exposition.\n• Truly unique NPC's with nuanced voice acting.\n• A great modding community.\n\nAND... you can build and design your own companion (called "pawns"). You want a tiny little petite female to flit around in her panties with blonde hair in pony tails as she lathers you in healing spells and sends fire balls into bad guys AND calls you master? Done. You want a super massive amazonian woman with a battle hammer and a deep, throaty voice? Done. You want a longbow-wielding chode-shaped man named "Booboo" with a swarthy, little brown mustache? No problem. I don't know why you would want that, but no problem. And you can share your pawn with the entire player base, and you can (in turn) use other players' pawns for yourself.\n\nIn short: If you like Skyrim, Witcher and/or Dark Souls, you will LOVE THIS GAME.\n\nCons:\nThe opening scene and tutorial do NOTHING to show you how great this game is.\nTakes a couple hours of game time before the world really opens up.\n\nMODS:\nHere are the three main mods I use which I highly recommend:\n• Great Mod Compilation 1.6\n• Gransys Texture Improvement Project\n• Sweet FX Preset\n\nNOTES: I have played Dragon's Dogma in 12 hour blocks for a week straight. My mouse-wrist is in a splint now. My fingers look like bloated sausages and my wrist looks like a dead trout and the pain is unreal. Doctor told me to stay away from the computer for a week. I laughed and cried and then aimed a haunting howl directly into the doctor's face and navel.

I was incredibly hyped towards it and still it somehow exceeded my expectations, easily becoming my favourite game in that generation of videogames.\n\nEvery fight will feel like an epic battle, I've never had the pleasure of experiencing a combat system that's as smooth as this whilst still having incredible animations and somehow remains fun at the same time. You'll spend hundreds of hours running around Gran Soren, finding awesome equipment and completing quests - until you feel brave enough to face Bitterblack Isle.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it has its flaws, but it's one of the few games where I can admit that without them ruining the experience for me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/367500/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen  is a Western-inspired Japanese action RPG that on the surface appears to be little more than a rather middle of the road game at best. The setting is instantly familiar and tired, with well-trodden dirt paths, castles, and the usual selection of character classes, monsters, and grubby peasants. That, however, is only part of the story. Below that well-worn surface is a game offering enough new ideas, mechanics, and surprising turns to keep even the most jaded RPG fan keen to see what lies beyond the next rise. The destination may not always be what you would hope, but the journey is often fascinating, and seldom quite what you expect.\n\nDragon’s Dogma doesn’t come with one of those fancy ‘remastered’ tags that we’ve been seeing so much of lately but is instead a straight port. Having come out for the PS3 and XBox 360 back in 2012. While it is, in essence, the same game as you knew back then, Capcom have decided to take full advantage of today’s graphical advancements to upgrade the visuals… if you can run it. You’re able to run the game in 60 FPS, which is incredibly impressive, but you are also able to completely unlock the framerate. It is also 4K supported, so if you have the kind of equipment to do these kinds of things (I do not), the game is going to look stunning.\n\nThe story places the player in the boots of a created hero. The creation tools have enough power to create something that resembles a human, maybe even close to what you look like. It’s very similar in style to tool creations in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim or Dragon Age: Inquisition, but don’t expect going into this game with a character creator from some of the latest massively multiplayer online role-playing games that have those amazing detail character creators.\n\nFor any single player RPG, the story is the skeleton that everything rests on, and sadly what’s here is the weakest skeleton I’ve encountered in an RPG in a very long time. In the opening cutscene, your village is attacked by a dragon, which promptly kills you and devours your heart. You awaken to discover not only are you not dead, but are now the Arisen, and fate has destined you to do great things. World changing things! Things no other can do… you know the rest. Hardly inspiring stuff despite the obvious desire to make it so, and sadly that holds true for the entire game. Thankfully, once you veer off the beaten path, Dragon’s Dogma will reveal not only many hidden secrets, but a fascinating and wonderfully crafted world that you will want to explore.\n\nThe real colour and detail of the world is found by talking to the various characters populating the landscape, many of whom will provide interesting titbits or useful quest information. This is important, because Dragon’s Dogma is not about to hold your hand and lead you to your destination. So exploration and conversation are vital to completing quests, and unlike many modern RPGs, starting a quest does not mean you’re up to the task of completing it. Rather than being frustrating though, harder quests always feel grounded in the world’s reality, and emphasise your place within it.\n\nYour player character is able to choose between nine different vocations. Some are standard variations of traditional fighter, rogue, and mage classes, and others offer more advanced options, mixing and matching abilities from the more traditional class types. With “discipline” earned through levelling up, you purchase new abilities and attacks, and access to new vocations. You can change between unlocked vocations from an inn at any time, and most passive abilities will carry over between classes. Your vocation level is counted independently of your character level, further encouraging you to experiment with new builds and abilities.\n\nEach of these classes allows a unique playstyle in the action-based combat, which is the game’s greatest strength. Different enemies obviously have different weaknesses, requiring you to change up your tactics based on who or what you’re facing. Using various abilities and managing health and stamina consumption gives the game strategic depth approaching that of a more traditional turn-based RPG, while the action itself is fast and exciting, owing to good movement options and animations that make every attack feel immediate and impactful.\n\nAnd that’s just when you’re fighting normal enemies. The true highlight of Dragon’s Dogma are its encounters with big, mythical monsters: trolls, ogres, hydras, chimeras, griffins, and yes, dragons. With obvious cues from Shadow of the Colossus, you can jump on and climb these creatures to get at their various weak points, while carefully avoiding their attempts to swat you away. Grabbing onto a griffin’s feathers will give you an easy hold to strike its head, but the monster could easily take to the skies and shake you loose, causing you to plummet to your death.\n\nThese encounters are exciting every time they happen, and slowly scaling the back of a cyclops to plunge a dagger in its eye was just as satisfying 20 hours in as it was the first time. My only complaint is wishing there was more - more encounters, more variety, and more scale. The creatures are huge, but the only truly massive creature is the game’s final boss, which provides a multi-stage, truly epic encounter that I would have loved to see more of.\n\nAlso, you do not walk this world alone. Your party of four will consist of three Pawns: one custom made Pawn of your own design and two recruits. Pawns reside in a realm known as the Rift, and devoid of emotions or a will of their own, they are bound to the Arisen and will follow his or her command without hesitation. Even so, finding that perfect combination of warriors, rogues, and spell weavers to aid you in your quest is vital. The only real irritation with the Pawns is their lack of distinct personalities, and their all too soon repeated inane commentary as you wander the world. Thankfully this can be turned off, but the lack of interesting party members is something that follows you just as obviously as the Pawns themselves.\n\nWhile the two recruit Pawns are essentially disposable, your own Pawn remains at your side for the entirety of the adventure, and will level with you and adapt its behaviour based on how you play. This is important, because just as you can recruit Pawns, other players can recruit yours as well, and all custom Pawns can be recruited from within the Rift to join another player’s game.\n\nRecruited Pawns earn experience, knowledge of the world, and loot while in another player’s party, all of which they will bring to realm of that Pawn’s creator. This asynchronous online functionality gives you additional reason to make the strongest and most appealing Pawn you can: you want your Pawn to be hired because not only will it become stronger, but sometimes it will provide your party with something unexpected and uniquely valuable.\n\nThe overall presentation of the game is fantastic, and looks awesome on PC. I found the game ran perfectly at 1080p with consistent 60 fps. The game has plenty of options to play with, which include HDR, textures, anti-aliasing and other features that improve the experience. It still looks like an old game compared to some of the recent releases, but it still holds up fine. The world is full of interesting characters to talk to, and many quests to take on. I also really enjoyed the whimsical soundtrack, that added a feeling of magic and fantasy.\n\nDragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen mixes the well-worn and overplayed clichés of the genre with just enough new stuff to keep things mostly fresh. Its story may be completely disposable, but the world itself is fascinating. It also has the honour of being one of the best-executed ports I have ever played.","March 11","true","102.9"," 268 of 297 people (90%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","90","268","297","13","9"

But hey, I don't want to spoil everything.\n\ndemons souls fights: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EcmVrQUPQU\n\ndark souls fights: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPUOCLbf7Qw\na typical fight where in order to win you need to keep your wits about you and learn the proper strategy according to your class in order to succeed.\n\nnow let's look at how a Warrior handles a chimera in dragons dogma.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I_hdPFdWEs\n\nsome more dragons dogma battles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2v-FYCN72M\n\nagain, you can judge for yourself but I feel there's just a bit more oomph in the combat; but hey, maybe it's just the sound.\n\nI have windows 10 and 3 people reported issues, what about me?\ncheck your specs and run it against what's listed in the steam store, I'm also running windows 10 but I get beautiful frames on this game and my rig cost about 900$. I'm also an AMD person, which many people believe performs more poorly.\n\nhow's the pawn system? as of monday janurary 18th 2016, it's been fixed. Speaking of pawns, they can be really helpful but read up on inclinations if you want other people to hire the pawn you made and give you that delicious rift crystal money, because you'll need it for the amazing experience that is Bitterblack Isle.\n\nhow's the gameplay?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TPlW5TF6ao\n\nread up on the wiki how many skills each class has; mystic knight(my favorite class if you were wondering) has thirty-four, and at any time you can equip a maximum of 6. that sounds low, but it makes things interesting; you can also equip core skills for each of the NINE different vocations, and augments that you unlock in each vocation can be carried over into other classes, encouraging you to try out each class. the restriction of skills makes the party composition a big deal and you'll learn to take pride as your pawn gets rented out often with happy people sending back gifts and praise that your pawn helped keep everyone else alive.\n\nI heard the dialogue is awful! the final boss monologue is really cool, but yeah the conversations are alright; feels appropriate for medival times, though. Essentially, I found it on a level of quality marginally better than dead rising.\n\n\nvery rewarding game; tempted to go into all the little unlockables and my favorite parts about it, but talking about this game makes me want to play it some more, so make your call if you think it's worth 30$.\n\nEnough with the comparison; what's great about this game TO YOU? What drew me into the game? Honestly, the atmosphere has a serious draw to it. I've dumped a lot of hours into a lot of games that want me to feel like I'm a hero and they do succeed, but the atmosphere to those games personally had me focusing on certain goals and it would be a matter where I'd only enjoy the experience once I succeeded, and everything up to that goal was an obstacle.\n\nDragons Dogma on the otherhand, reminded me of two things; journeys are fun, and do NOT take enemies for granted. Here's the example; I was escorting something through a canyon pass, fending off wolves and harpies who wanted my cargo. Fending them off was an annoying obstacle in my quest to get this escort over and done with. We even tangled with goblins, who are actually pretty amusing. They rushed us from up ahead and we killed a dozen of them. We moved onwards, seeing a huge field ahead.\n\nI was leading the way, and looked at the foliage around us. I was looking at a large bush when it started screaming at me.\n\nA goblin literally jumped out of the bush and shanked me in the neck, right as I was certain we fought all of them.\n\nwhat's dragon's dogma?\n\nDragons Dogma is that little goblin that jumps out of bushes just when you thoght you killed all of them. What I loved was that it told so much; these little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s were SMART, and not to be taken lightly; later in the game (no spoilers) you learn that they can do more than ambush to cause you problems. I really enjoyed that experience in new game+ though, because I had a pawn with a longbow that one-shot that goblin mid-jump, and seeing enemies get hit with arrows in mid-air is the coolest thing ever, so I highly recommend getting one ranger or strider pawn; alternatively, you yourself could be a magic archer.\n\nthat was just one experience with one enemy; let's not get started on what it's like to fight ogres in a dark cave.\n\nhttp://i.cubeupload.com/Bd16Oa.jpg\n\nthey are fond of staring.","January 18","true","74.2"," 278 of 321 people (87%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","87","278","321","31","17"

For my kind do not heed the toothless‘Grigori\n__________________________________________\n\n(Don’t mind my time here on steam, I played the game for several hundred hours back on PS3 in 2013, slaying Grigori, Daimon and the Ur-Dragon countless times)\n\nIt was a shame that there was no PC port for several years as this game was one of the few that I really missed after leaving console gaming. This explains why I was more than just happy when noticing that there will be finally a port in 2016 - and now it's here, waiting for new adventurers, explorers and dragonslayers.\n\nWhat’s new compared to 'Dark Arisen' (2013)?\nImproved textures and graphics\nUnlimited Framerate\nReduced graphic glitches (pop-up and tearing)\nPawn chatter can be deactivated (Harpies! - Harpies! - Harpies! *mute*)\nNo more japanese voices and Berserk armors sets due to licensing issues\nNew achievements for Bitterblack IsleWhat’s new compared to the original 'Dragon’s Dogma‘ (2012)?\nSame points as above\nThe content of the 'Dark Arisen' expansion which features a huge end-level dungeon with lots of loot, new enemies and bosses and a quite dark atmosphere\nSlight monster changes in the main game (new types introduced in DA were added to specific areas)\nAn improved fast travel system (usage is cheaper and there are more possible waypoints hidden along the main quests)\nAll former DLCs are included (several armors and stuff that actually looks quite good) as well as the Eternal Ferrystone (can be found in the storage after arriving in Gran Soren)So now there’s the important question: Can I recommended the game?\n\nIn general I’d say 'absolutely' as I love the game. However there are some negative points that are hard to ignore. If you like...\nBadass battles in a DMC-styled fighting system with lots and lots of action…\nBoss fights that are actually interesting and feel different compared to normal enemies aside from their DMG and HP (concepts like climbing them to reach weak points makes the fights way more interesting)…\nA diversified class and weapon system with unique skills, augmentations and abilities that allow your character to fit your personal playstyle…\nA superb character creator (height, weight, eye color, scars… there are many options for creating badass characters that don’t look like ugly goblins that were hit with a spiky mace (like in many other titles))...\nExploring a huge world full of monsters to slay and treasures to loot with nights that are dark and full of terror (at least early on)...…I can definitely recommend the game to you. From my point of view these are the key elements where 'Dragon’s Dogma‘ really shines and makes tons of fun. Casting massive maelstroms or meteors, shooting enchanted arrows or smashing foes with a two meter long sword is absolutely entertaining and may keep you going and ignoring some downsides. Just one more ingredient to improve my armor, only this little area to explore…\n\nHowever if your focus on RPGs tends more towards…\nA brilliant story full of twists and remarkable events where you can’t wait what’s happening next…\nInteresting characters with lots of personality and a great development…\nProfound dialogues full of meaningful decisions…… well… I guess you‘d better skip this game and look for sth. else as the game doesn’t really shine bright in these categories. More an expiring torch in a storm than a dragonflame.\n\nThe story has some good moments (especially towards the end) but most of the time you will either ignore it and kill stuff far away from the main quest or you’ve probably forgotten all about what’s happening, slicing up stuff on the main path and just don’t care anymore about the 'why'. In addition the lip synch is mostly awful, most of the characters are as flat as a piece of paper and have nearly no development at all and there are at most one or two meaningful decisions that… don’t have a lot of impact in the end.\n__________________________________________\n\nModding and Improvements\nThere's one more topic that I want to mention: Modding.\nIt’s a shame that there is no official mod support - sure, Gransys is huge and has several nice areas but many places feel deserted and the game would benefit a lot from custom quests, new dungeons or additional challenges. Luckily the modding community on e.g. the Nexus is quite active and already released several (small) interesting mods. Bringing back the japanese voices or improving the graphics with better textures? No problem! Small changes to armors, weapons and stats can also be found, however huge mods, like e.g. new enemies, quest lines or areas can't be done that way.\n\nCapcom didn’t add any new content to the game however they reduced the awful pop-ups ('Oh look it’s an empty field – five seconds later: I’m right in a group of goblins that poped-up instantly and smashed me to mash), the tearing and the lags and added options for unlimited FPS and to mute pawn chatter (finally, our little fellows were quite annoying sometim-... 'Harpies!' 'Soaked to the bone!' 'Look master! Wolves!' ... 'Harpies!').\n__________________________________________\n\nConclusion\nOverall it's the same great game I already enjoyed back on PS3 with slight improvements. Sadly these changes only comprise technical aspects and no new content. However I still have a lot of fun and I'd buy a 2nd part (no MMO!) of 'Dragon's Dogma' instantly because the first one entertained me for a long time and I’d rate it gladly at least 8.5 out of 10 points, despite all the shadows and downsides.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/367500/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","For a massive game like Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen, I would have liked to have written a 2500+ word review. In a way, I should be grateful that Steam limits me to about half of that, because it gives me the opportunity to focus on the most important qualities. Back in 2012, Dragon's Dogma was my pick for Game of the Year. I also really enjoyed the Dark Arisen expansion released nearly a year later. In order to explain why this game is so great, I refer to one of my game-design philosophies.\n\nMaking the game yours.\n\nAll too often, videogames (even open-world RPGs) make the unforgivable mistake of feeling too limited. It's not enough to have customizable characters, the game also has to allow the player plenty of freedom. Now I'm not saying that the player should be allowed to fly around the map or kill all of the bosses in one-shot, just because they want to. This level of freedom still operates within the rules of the game, but it gives the player ample opportunities to develop a method for playing through it. When used properly, this approach can lead to compelling and long-lasting entertainment.\n\nDragon's Dogma is the perfect example of this philosophy. Before your fateful encounter with a dragon, you were just another nobody villager. Now you're the Arisen, the great hero that will...well...you probably already have an idea where the story will go next. How you make this adventure yours is through battle. As one would expect from Devil May Cry veteran Hideaki Itsuno, this game excels in terms of combat options. There are nine vocations, all with their own unique skills and attributes. It doesn't matter if you want to cast spells, fire arrows, or swing a heavy sword around, all of the options are rewarding and satisfying in their own way.\n\nI can't emphasize this aspect enough. The combat is astonishing in its ability to engage the player. The mechanics are tight, the level of feedback is perfect, and the options keep everything fresh. Usually I'm not a fan of archers in Action-RPGs. Most of the time they're forced to keep away from the action so that their arrows aren't interrupted. With this game, archers can seamlessly shift from mid to close-range thanks to their daggers. Hitting weak-points with a flurry of arrows is exceptionally-handled. While Mages take more of a support role, Sorcerers can use incredibly powerful spells. Meteors, tornadoes, and other elements of pure destruction can take a long time to cast, but the results are always worth it.\n\nThrough the usage of pawns, you can create a fighting party that suits your play-style. Mages tend to be essential due to their healing spell, but you can compensate by carrying more potions, or consider their absence an added challenge. Going further, players can decide to toss their pawns into the ocean, and spend the entirety of the game all alone. While a surprising number of quests have multiple solutions, the identity you craft for this game, will most likely be the kind that can only be forged in battle.\n\nI've always thought of the pawn system as really fascinating. It reminds me of From Software's Souls franchise. While there isn't any direct multiplayer in the form of co-op and or pvp, your main pawn can assist other players in their endeavors. Aside from direct combat, these pawns can also provide information on quests, and gather anything of interest. In short, your experience with the pawn will make them more effective if and when they're summoned. It's like the ghosts and orange messages in Dark Souls. Even when you aren't being invaded or summoning help, you're still interacting with others in a very indirect fashion.\n\nThe Dark Arisen expansion adds a remarkable dungeon known as Bitterblack Isle. Typically, this area is best approached by players that have already completed the main game. It's not the only approach though. Some creative players have done BBI-only runs. Since the expansion can be accessed less than an hour into the game, there's nothing stopping anyone from attempting its depths. These challenge runs give the game added dimension. Just don't be surprised to find that almost everything kills you in one hit. Still, if you can manage to avoid foes and collect gear, you'll have a chance of succeeding.\n\nUltimately, you'll find that the challenges you make for yourself are what will keep this game fresh. Although the game punishes you with slower movement and reduced stamina gain, it's possible to load up on a ton of healing items. To add to this, unlike action games that penalize you, or prevent you from using items in certain situations (like being grabbed), Dragon's Dogma allows you to pause at any time to administer aid. Certain skills and combinations are a little too devastating for the monsters. This can result in stun-lock situations, or quick-kills. It reminds me of Capcom's AD&D beatemups. The boss battles can be ordeals, or they can end in seconds through a particular strategy. This is part of the reason why I mentioned some player-imposed challenges in the review.\n\nAs ambitious as the combat is, the rest of the game is less so. The bulk of the main-game is going to consist of side-quests. Some are interesting in that they have actual consequences, but there are a few times where there's a convincing lack of follow-through. To give an example. Somebody with a suspicious background will say that he has jobs lined up for you, but nothing ever comes of it. Gransys, the land that you'll be exploring, isn't nearly as geographically dense or diverse as your everyday Elder Scrolls. There are some unique sights and a handful of optional areas to explore, but wandering around outside can get tiresome and dull. On the bright side, at least this edition adds more portcrystals and an infinite use ferry stone. Between these two items, you can set up various locations to teleport between.\n\nIn typical JRPG fashion, the townspeople don't have much of import to say. Actually, this might be a plus for some gamers. One of the things that I have grown to loathe is talking to EVERYBODY when I arrive at a new town. With this game, unless a person has an icon floating over their head, they're not worth conversating with. One of the stranger aspects of the game is the fact that you can get most of the NPCs to fall in love with you. Unfortunately the system is pretty wonky. In my last play-through, I got stuck in a relationship with Fournival. I'm pretty sure I didn't give this fat disgusting pig any gifts, and I even punched him in the face a few times.\n\nAll in all, Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen is a fantastic action-RPG. The non-combat aspects are somewhat problematic, but it's possible you'll forget about them as the hours pass. Honestly, just look how much time I put into this game, and that's not including the 120+ hours I spent with the inferior Xbox 360 version.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","January 25","true","77.3"," 181 of 198 people (91%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","91","181","198","14","5"

You live in a small fishing village called Cassardis in a province called Gransys. Gransys is in a world filled with mythical creatures ranging from small goblins to huge chimeras but that makes the events of the game’s first day no less shocking to those who inhabit this fictional world. A dragon is summoned by dark and mysterious forces and his first target is Cassardis. Watching most of the people you know die horribly at the hands of the dragon spurs you into action, armed with nothing but a sword you give the dragon all you’ve got. The dragon bats you away as if you are nothing more than a fly but instead of killing you, the dragon steals your heart, binding your life to that of the dragon and you become the Arisen. The Arisen is believed to be the only person in the world capable of defeating the dragon and so you become an incredibly important person in Gransys.\n\nAs with all games, the first thing you’ll notice about DD: DA is how it looks. Being a game that originally released around four years ago, the graphics aren’t exactly cutting edge and some of the textures aren’t what you’d call easy on the eye but there is a real improvement over the original game and it does look pretty good. One of the main problems with the original release of the game was its poor performance but thankfully that’s all been fixed now. Even with a PC in the middle of minimum and recommended (with a pretty weak GPU) I’m able to run the game pretty much maxed out with a stable 30FPS. The UI and menus are all pretty good though you can tell they were made for console rather than PC, I played with a controller so I didn’t have any issues but playing with M&KB may be a bit of a pain at times.\n\nMoving on to gameplay, DD: DA is what you’d expect from a third person ARPG. The game offers you a choice of six basic vocations (classes) and three hybrid vocations (a combination of two basic ones). The basic vocations are all what you’d expect, you’ve got two fighter classes, two ranged/dagger classes and two magic-based classes. Each vocation comes with specific equipment (though most equipment can be used by similar vocations, not just one), skills (active and passive) and of course a unique playstyle. Active skills consist of weapon-specific special attacks such as a skill which lets you fire six arrows at once for the ranged classes and spells for the magic-based classes. The passive skills are again unique to each vocation and offer you certain bonuses such as more health at night time or take less damage when your weapons are sheathed.\n\nDD: DA’s unique selling point is its pawn system. You have one main pawn and two other pawns when you’re playing the game. Your main pawn is effectively a second character but one that is not controller by the player, meaning you decide what they look like, wear, use as weapons etc. but you don’t actually control them. Your main pawn can be any one of the six basic vocations and it’s often wise to switch between them once you’ve reached the max vocation level so you can get useful skills from other vocations. The other two pawns are other people’s main pawns and you have no control over them. There’s a place in the game called The Rift, accessed using Rift Stones, and you can go there to search for and enlist two pawns. As you go through the game, your main pawn will receive knowledge on enemies, missions and locations after you’ve encountered said things and they will then relay helpful information about these things to any other players who decide to enlist your pawns. Once you’re done using a pawn you ‘send it back’ with a gift for its creator as well as a basic review of its appearance and effectiveness. It’s important to have a good mix of pawns of different vocations so you’ll need to play around with your set up to get it just right.\n\nBeing an ARPG, there’s a hell of a lot of fighting in DD: DA. Unfortunately, fighting regular mobs is pretty tedious as they don’t pose much challenge at all and they feel like they’ve just been placed into what is already a bland game world. Thankfully DD: DA’s boss fights more than make up for the disappointing mobs. Most of the bosses are absolutely huge, have loads of health and deal incredible amounts of damage. What makes boss fights so much fun is that you can climb on large enemies, allowing you to attack them up close and personal as well as allowing you to more easily exploit their weaknesses. Boss fights also award you with huge EXP rewards as well as a fair bit of loot, usually in the form of rare crafting materials.\n\nI’ll briefly return to the issue of the bland game world, one of two major issues with the game. Gransys simply doesn’t feel like a real place. The two cities in the game have small populations and feel pretty empty when you’re wandering around them but outside the cities the problem is even worse. You can sometimes go a couple of minutes without seeing anyone and since the game involves a lot of long and tedious travelling (thanks to the lack of a proper fast travel system, my other major issue with the game) the world feels all the more empty. While you can set up a fast travel system later on in the game using a limited number of rare items, early on in the game you have to walk across what is a rather large map with the occasional sprints in between waiting for your stamina bar to slowly recharge.\n\nOnce you’re done with the base game you can move on to post-game, Dark Arisen and then unlimited New Game plus runs as well as a hard mode and speedrun mode. Post-game offers more challenging enemies and loot while Dark Arisen is the game’s only DLC and again offers more challenging enemies, particularly more challenging boss fights. After completing all that and going through the final mission of post-game you’re given the option to start the game again but with the same character, skills and equipment which can then be done every time you beat the game, offering endless replayability though you’ll probably be done with the game after your second run.\n\nVerdict\nWorth Purchasing.\n\nDespite taking place in a bland world, DD: DA’s fantastic pawn system and boss fights make this an ARPG that’s well worth playing. DD: DA may not be as tough as some games but it does provide enough of a challenge to make completing it and even just beating some of the harder bosses incredibly satisfying. If you like a good third person ARPG, do yourself a favour and pick this one up.\n\nLone Ranger Reviews.\n\nEl K.","January 31","true","38.0"," 178 of 205 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","178","205","7","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xVArchonVx/recommended/367500/","xVArchonVx","Archon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xVArchonVx/","127 products in account","Hmm. Where to start? I guess I'll be blunt and say this one of my favorite Capcom games/favorite RPGs of all time. The game feels like a combination of Monster Hunter and Devil May Cry, albeit amplifying and capitalizing on the former's missed potential. The gameplay is smooth and has a touch of DMC-inspired action to it, though not as over-the-top. The Pawn system is an interesting concept and appeals to the side of me that likes watching the AI do the dirty work for me. There are times though when the AI does come up short, but even still it is very competent.\n\nThe Monster Hunter aspect of combat is more-or-less fully realized in letting you actually climb on monsters in real-time while they try to shake you off, rather than a pseudo-minigame like in 4U. It's very satisfying to work together with your Pawns and watch them unleash both spell and steel in combination with your own attacks to barrage an enemy into defeat. The game also has pretty nice pacing when it comes to making each encounter more strenous and epic, leading all the way up to one of the best boss/dragon fights I've ever seen in a game. Enemies like the Gryphon actually feel like they're doing everything in their ability to take you down. Rather than have the AI purposely handicap itself by frequently staying on the ground, enemies that can fly will do so to make sure you have a hard time conquering them (which is where the Pawn/AI system works to compliment your tactics). Wrangling a large creature also feels more like a risk/reward tactic rather than a push "A" to win scenario. An enemy will do their best to shake you off, robbing you of stamina, and possibly your life if they fling you off the edge of a large drop.\n\nThe implementation and execution of the Pawn system is, for the most part, well done. Players can "share" Pawns with other players around the world. While with them, or with you they will level and can learn about new tactics for enemies or how to fulfill quests. When they are returned to their original owner, they will keep this knowledge to better serve you.\n\n\nThe negatives to the game come in the form of the camera sometimes being erratic when mounting a creature, or being under the feet of a large enemy. I would have liked some alpha transparency use for when the camera collides with models in a fight. Though considering how easily the fighting system lets you pull out of a bad situation, such an issue will rarely be the cause of death. Pawns can also seem a bit too timid at times, and will refuse to capitalize on chances to heavily punish an enemy. Traveling may also grind on players until they start knowing when and where to place down port crystals. It seems this issue was partially mitigated with the addition of an "Eternal Ferrystone" with infinite uses, though you will at some points have to plan out long journeys on foot. If you're expecting a heavy emphasis on RPG choice elements like in a Bioware game, you'll be left wanting here. There are some sections of the game that are dependant on how you approach a situation, but most are black and white choices.\n\nAs a port, the game is well-optimized and further remedies any camera problems by allowing one to change the FOV. There are 4k textures as well for more powerful setups, though don't expect the game to look amazing even with them on.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for an Open-World, RPG with a intuitive combat system/AI creation and some epic fights I'd highly recommend Dragon's Dogma.\n\n8.8 out of 10.","January 16","true","58.4"," 157 of 185 people (85%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","85","157","185","7","6"

It's really great, since It's ported to PC the game won't drop to 10 fps whenever something "big" happens on the screen. I really like the idea of the "Pawn System" to Dragons Dogma, allowing you to create your own "main" pawn, and use other online players pawns. The soundtracks (In my opinion) are also incredible.\n\nI also really like the character creation, from changing your eye color, to your height, to the shape of your chest, arms and legs, to your stance and much more!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/angrytigerp/recommended/367500/","angrytigerp","Angrytiger [USN IRL]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/angrytigerp/","738 products in account","Yet another "Played it back in the day" review, but it's really important to emphasize that. I have ample experience with this game. I'm not just posting a blind review just for a free thumbs-up.\n\nSo going into Dragon's Dogma, you've gotta keep one thing in mind: It was a console exclusive made before The Witcher 3, and shortly after Dark Souls and Skyrim. To compare it to the formermost is an unfair benchmark, because TW3 obviously came out years later and had time to take advantage of feedback for TW2 and, yes, Dragon's Dogma. To compare it to Dark Souls is to try to apples-and-oranges the gameplay comparison, as Dark Souls features a large diversity of individual weapons with nuances compared to Dragon's Dogma relatively same-y weapons coupled with unique RPG skills. And the Elder Scrolls, as a series, has a completely different exploratory feel to this game, but unlike Skyrim, Dragon's Dogma doesn't feel like it needs to lead you around by the hand to everything.\n\nNow, what do you get when you play DD? The pros:\n\n- Overall, it is an action-filled, open-world romp with 9 classes that feel completely different (hell, even ignoring the 3 'advanced' classes, you have 6 totally unique playstyles).\n\n-A novel approach to partybuilding emphasizes gameplay first. No longer do you need to think "oh, man, should I take the guy who was complaining about his ex-wife, or the girl who was hitting on me?" Companions (Pawns in-game) are literally mindless automatons, and the game unabashedly accepts the fact. And because the game is more focused on the sheer spectacle of climbing all over monsters and hacking and slashing them as they try to buck you off (minus terrible QTEs or gauges that you have to manage), coupled with the encouragement (read: necessity) to change pawns on a regular basis as hirees don't level up, means that your party is as fluid as your playstyle can be.\n\n-While we're at it -- look, I don't know many games that make it possible to go fluidly from relentlessly bashing monsters in the face with a sword, with no regard for your safety, one moment, re-classing, then performing screen-shaking active blocks with your elementally-charged shield, do you? Okay, sure, Skyrim, but Skyrim doesn't have the fact that in order to best level up, you NEED to vary between classes, both to manage stat growths (which differ based on what class you were when you leveled up) and to unlock passive skills which can be applied at any time to any class.\n\n-The world may not be the biggest one ever concocted, but it feels alive. Feelin' froggy? Wander off the road and you'll find wild beasts (often of mythical origins) waiting to tear your party apart. Or, travel the roads at night and run into bandits. The fast-travel system is also intentionally gimped in the early parts of the game, and for once I actually felt like this was a good thing -- unlike The Witcher 3, where you can just gallop down a road for literally minutes seeing nothing along the way, in DD you see a cave off in the distance and decide to go explore it. Or you actually take a wrong turn, clear out an area, then realize you're going the wrong way. I know it sounds frustrating, but it's actually FUN. You actually feel like you're in a REAL WORLD.\n\n-The story may be a bit bland, but it's got its share of political drama, tragedy, and revenge. Essentially, as I detailed above, you shouldn't really come into this game expecting to be blown away, but there are enough little tweaks to a rote formula to make it enjoyable.\n\n-The magic is great enough to earn its own damned bulletpoint. Playing a Sorcerer in this game feels downright amazing. Spells rip the screen apart, from the lowly fireball to a massive sky-splitting meteor shower. And with the Pawn system, you really have to actually treat mages (whether it's you or pawned [heh] off to an NPC) like glass cannons, making them feel like true magical artillery.\n\nCons? Well:\n\n-It's a game from 2012 (2011? Something like that), and it shows. Graphics, even uncompressed, are muddy, and you can either go with the dull coloration and odd tints of vanilla or use an injector like SweetFX and realize that the only way to fix certain things is to crush the blacks into a pulp. Unfortunate, that.\n\n-Audio design really is nothing to write home about. The music is generic fantasy fare, but if you know anything about DD, you know that its dialogue is almost a running joke. Pawns will NOT SHUT UP. They say the SAME THING over and over. Did you know that wolves hunt in packs? Oh, you remember your pawn telling you that the last time you fought them about 200 feet up the road? Well, they'll remind you. Fortunately, this banter can be turned off with an in-game option, but... If you haven't played before, I recommend leaving it on for just a little bit, to understand what the old crowd of DD players dealt with.\n\n-While I haven't experienced any issues whatsoever myself, running this game at 1080p on an external monitor from my laptop (with borderless fullscreen forced using a third-party software), bear in mind that a lot of people have apparently had issues with the game, tech-wise. Look up to see if people had issues with hardware close to yours before committing.\n\n-In the endgame, after you've unlocked every vocation's skill, I'll be the first to admit that a lot of the magic of progression is gone. But... that's just it, in this it is NO DIFFERENT from any other RPG. I'm not sure why so many of the negative reviews imply that this is an issue of some sort. Nonetheless, with the many different playstyles available, you can easily just hotswap as you go, playing however you feel like at a certain moment.\n\n-One savegame only. I remember reading the justification for this somewhere, but anyways, the game is basically oriented around having one character, and focusing in on the inevitable New Game+. Some people don't mind, others do. I leave this up to you. External backup programs are already floating around, allowing you to swap files, so check them out if this is a major breaking point.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nIt's not a modern AAA title. It's a 5-year-old AA title. Does this mean it's bad? Hell no. Dragon's Dogma was a cult hit for a reason. While I won't be so cocky as to imply it is so, I wouldn't be surprised if CDPR took a lot of notes from it as they created The Witcher 3. In a world of simplified ARPGs, Dragon's Dogma just took the idea of gameplay-first and ran with it. No, it probably won't make you cry or tug at your heartstrings, it won't even be particularly interesting, but if you look at it as a game, you will realize that it is fantastic at what it does.\n\nPlus you can climb onto monsters and punch them until they die.\n\n9/10 would punch a griffin to death again.\n\nEDIT: This review was modified to get rid of my praise for The Witcher 3, because I thought that there was nearly-universal acclaim. To clarify, I had called it a 'modern masterpiece' because that sounded like the kind flower crap you put in reviews. Now, my profile said I've played it 50 minutes, this is untrue (a lot of time playing was spent offline), but I haven't beaten the game. I am not some massive TW3 fanboy. I just thought it was an okay, not-worth-60-bucks-but-still-okay, open-world RPG.\n\nThat said, if you didn't at least enjoy TW3, don't get Dragon's Dogma, because it feels very much so like DD is a less-detailed early version of TW3, with VERY similar world mechanics. The difference is that DD adds a layer of complexity through its class/vocation system that makes it more of an RPG, gameplay-wise, than TW3 was (obviously, the sidequests are much simpler in DD, and the main narrative is laughably bad compared to TW3 up until the last few hours of the main storyline).","January 15","true","10.3"," 127 of 151 people (84%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","84","127","151","20","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/367500/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen is an action role playing game, developed by Capcom. The original game was released on PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2013, before the game was finally ported to PC in January 2016.\n\nThe game starts with your character being super overpowered, with really rare equipment and dealing tons of damage, giving you a sneak peak into the type of end game content you have to come. But yes, you do get nerfed back down to the regular level 1 RPG character, in your rags and sticks for swords. You are able to choose between a number of different classes, or vocations as they are called in DD. On top of being in control of your character, you will also gain a party of up to three more “pawns”, these too take on specific roles in the group, such as tanks, damage and healers. I found this to be a really nice addition to the game as I wasn’t expecting such mechanics from an RPG game like this. The party controls and management system is basic at best, but the AI is fairly in tune with what they should be doing, and the two basic controls, attack and follow, are both really responsive as well.\n\nThe combat system in DD against the smaller style of enemies is very generic hack and slash, there is no real special combos or special abilities to come across, The warrior class is probably the most basic class to play, but is probably the one I would recommend for your first play through.  Where DD’s combat system really comes into its own, is when you get to scale larger enemies, such as giants, and cyclops.  This allows you to climb onto enemies backs and swing at them to deal more damage. This is a feature that I haven’t really seen incorporated into combat systems in recent memory, the last time I remember coming across it is in Shadow of the Colossus.\n\nYou can definitely tell this game was ported from the consoles as the graphics are average at best. The game is pretty poorly optimized as even though the graphics didn’t look brilliant, I wasn’t able to get the full 4k effect. The character models look pretty good once you get some more interesting looking armour and weapons to equip. Animation across the game is of a high standard though, with the regular combat hack and slash animations looking very cool when you can couple a few attacks together. You can get some really nice visual effects through the draw distance of the PC version of the game being superior, with some really nice looking environments when you are out in the open world.  This is a game which is completely voice acted, all to a really high standard as well.\n\nDD is a pretty hard game, even on the lower difficulty throughs, you will have challenges. You can really run into high level enemies without realizing it’s too late and your attacks do no damage at all. You have to make use of the game’s block system and your excessively large jump range too in order to dodge attacks and swipes. The use of the pawn system really aids the inexperienced players though, as they scale with your level too.\n\nWhilst DD has a really large open world for you to explore, it is really tedious to travel to and from places. The lack of any staple fast travel system without having to use consumables is a real pain. There was nothing more demoralizing than getting a quest, then seeing it was at the completely opposite side of the map, only to get there, and they tell you to go straight back. This problem at times almost made me not want to continue. There is a fast travel system, but it is not easily accessible and you require items which are not very common to find in the game too.\n\nCompleting the game took me twenty hours. I will admit, I didn’t complete as many side quests as I would normally, and this was purely down to the giant map, and no fast travel system. The side quest system is also pretty in-depth too; because if you go too far in the main story line, you are unable to complete some side quests, which means if you want to go for the complentionists approach to this game, you best get that Wiki bookmarked to make sure you don’t miss out on anything! I would say there is an element of replay ability, not only does the game have a New game+ mode, but also has a speed run mode which is nice to see. You could also get another play through out of playing as a different class to change up the variety a bit.\n\nTechnically, the game is sound. I didn’t have any crashes or bugs. The graphic side of the game is poorly optimized as my rig should be able to cope with his game on ultra-settings but sadly it got some chugging and frame drops on the higher graphical options. You can tell the game is a console port as the menus are clearly made for consoles, and do not incorporate the use of keyboard and mouse very easily. That being said, I did play the game completely with a keyboard and mouse but the game could quite easily be played using a controller.\n\nIn summary, Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen is a really good action RPG game. The only negatives I found are the poorer graphics, and the annoying fast travel system. If these aren’t problems which will grind on you, then DD is a stellar game. The combat system is really interesting, along with an intriguing story line. If you manage to complete all of the side quests on offer, you could easily get 30 or so hours out of this game, plus any further runs you do in the other game modes. The game is really nicely priced at £23,99. I am going with a highly recommendation of this game\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

But here it is, like some Virgin Mary Miracle, The Idea Too Good to Happen, The Über-Selling Product looking like the best ever thing on paper but alas no one could ever have the willpower, sheer gall and vast sea of money to ever make it happen for real.\n\nAnd yet, today you find solace in that all your dreams came true when the crazy guys at Capcom decided to do this:\n\nImagine the meticulous level design of Dark Souls, but applied to a mini-Skyrim setting. Then merge those two already massive-selling features with 9 classes to pick from, sporting Devil May Cry combat skills, which includes grabbing enemies, tossing them into pits and off of cliffs, chopping them to bits, setting them on fire, etc.\n\nAnd after those three layers, which should already have sold the game on their own, the Japanese Game Designer Demons decided to sugarcoat the already most delicious cake your filthy gamer tongue have ever had the pleasure of tasting with a FOURTH layer, the Pawns.\n\nYou create a Main Pawn to have at your side, and then, through the best and silliest multiplayer option, you can recruit up to two Support Pawns that are OTHER PLAYERS' Main Pawn. And other players in return can recruit YOUR Main Pawn in their party, and RATE them on how well they performed. Enjoy sorting through your Steam Friends List to try out the Pawns your friends have made, scroll through your favorite list of up to a 100 Pawns, and... The list goes on, and I have to go back and play more on my recent 24+ hours playing session, only broken apart by necessary toilet breaks and food.\n\nI got this game gifted and I owe that person a debt that can never be repaid. A second without playing this game is a second your life could have been a much better life.\n\nNot only is this game worth the full price many times over. It's worth buying a first-class plane ticket to visit Capcom, ask where the guys responsible for this game are at the current moment, go to that location, greet them with the most back-breaking bow you've ever produced, shine their boots/lick their feet, serve them an exclusive dinner, make their bed and pillow, and before you sing them a lullaby song, you ask them what else you can do as their real-life Pawn.\n\nAnd because you are not worthy and nothing you can do can weigh out what they have given you - the chance to play this game - you will just decide to commit seppuku. But you will die peacefully, knowing you have played the only game in the world that matters - Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen.","January 23","true","378.1"," 85 of 94 people (90%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","90","85","94","51","5"

This is not a sequel, it is a post of the console game, but a port done right!\n\nI could go on and on about how good this game is. It is not for everyone though. Want Skyrim or Witcher? Pass. There is a interesting story there but it is told in the typical Japanese European medieval themed way, and can be hard to follow. The game play is great.\n\nIt feels like Capcom opened a Monster Manual and started making a list of classic iconic fantasy creatures to add. Then they brought them to life with awesome animations. Each fight has depth and the monsters have a real weight to them.\n\nSome also say it is sort of like Demon Souls but it really is not.\nThe first hours of the game can be brutal and are also the most fun you'll have. Brave off the beaten path in the dead of night when you are only level 7 and you will die. You'll wonder what that glowing in the distance is, and find out as a Chimera roars in anger and pounces on you out of the dark shredding your body. You'll hear a noise over the rise and crest it to find an ancient lich rising a cabal of the undead.\n\nAlso for $30 you are getting a TON of gameplay. This game is packed with things to do.\n\nMy suggestion for first timers, during your first gameplay, avoid guides and wikis. Experience it with a fresh set of eyes free from spoilers and tips. This is an experience in of itself. Oh also crank the volume up. Some of the soundwork in this game is the best I've come across. From the waves crashing on the to beach to the water dripping and moans of the undead in a bank pitch black crypt.\n\nPositive's\n+ Runs at 60 fps on my 5 year old PC with everything maxed.\n+ Easy to immerse yourself in the environments.\n+ Monster fights are tough and rewarding. Watching your companions learn and get better at fighting them is a treat.\n+ Lots of gear to grind if you want to but not required.\n+ Play with other people's companions.\n+ Writing/speech helps nail the European Mythology feel.\n+ The Dragon is Epic.\n+ Action based gameplay that rewards careful planning and execution over button smashing. Tactical play is very much required.\n\nNegatives\n- The pawn chatter adds a lot to the game. HOWEVER it is over done and they will mention the same lines constantly.\n- You will want more monsters, there are a ton here and they are done great, but you will still want more.\n- Lots of pawn's to choose from, easy for yours to get lost in the shuffle.\n- Lots or running during your first playthrough. The game sends you all over the place back and forth. This is not a negative for everyone but it is worth mentioning. There is a fast travel system but you slowly gain more waypoints as the game progresses.\n\nIf you are a fan of RPGs and or action games, I would highly recommend this game! I've put in 200+ hours in the console version and I will probably be somewhere around that amount on the PC version.","January 30","true","97.9"," 72 of 80 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","72","80","4","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarSide/recommended/367500/","StarSide","Psychedelic Adventurer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarSide/","422 products in account","Tl'dr version:\nA stunning example of why graphics don't always make the game!\nWith incredible combat, and a great companion system, this game shines as one of the best RPG's to be ported to PC in years.\nFighting gigantic monsters never gets old, but some may be turned off by it's unrelenting, slightly unfair difficulty.\n\n\nElaborated version:\nSo, you've probably thought to yourself, "I wish there was game made which blends shadow of the colossus's climbing mechanics, fantastic RPG progression, and a robust combat system".\n\nWould you be surprised if I told you that game existed already? And it's possibly almost 4 years old at this point?\n\nDragons Dogma realized on the last gen consoles to much internet acclaim. People loved it for it's beefy combat, as well as the fantastic set piece moments which you crafted yourself. Rarely does a cutscene intrude in the middle of combat. It's characters and world was slightly...odd, but maintained a level of uniqueness rarely found in RPG's which went out of the trip A market. The soundtrack people seemed to love as well, I however never really saw the appeal.\nThe console version however, had a alarming tendency to almost never come out of the 20's of FPS. Safe to say, it ran f***ing terrible.\nThat's when Capcom finally saw the light and deemed it worth porting over to PC for us to have a bash at. And let me tell you it really made the difference.\n\nThe first thing I'd like to note about this port is that it's not a slap dash thing done by some cowboy Capcom farmed it out to, which is pleasant sight to see considering their other ports of console games have been middling at best\n(Dead Rising 3 anyone?).\nInstead, we are treated to a whole host of graphics options which are usually not included in ports. This includes seamless drop in,drop out of console/M&KB, mouse support in menus, and a fairly flushed out graphics options menu.\nIt's also very scalable. This thing will run on a potato, and for it's age it had bloody better.\nThe only gripe I would have is that's options of AA are rather limited.\n\nIf you would like to know more about the optimization of this game I'd recommend you watch this video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-fZyDad4io\nIn regards to the story:\nIt's confusing at best, bare bones and ridiculous at worst. It's a JRPG, what do you expect?\nIt has it's share of fun characters, and funny moments however, and I'm willing to let it pass for that. I wasn't expecting a Epic narrative like Skyrim's or the Witcher; It did the job.\n\nThe greatest thing about Dragons Dogma is undoubtedly its combat system. This is hardly surprising, considering that were talking about a game made by CAPCOM  its action titles are well known and specifically, Dragons Dogma director Hideaki Itsuno was also director for DMC2 (Forget about that one), 3 and 4. This guy knows this stuff when it comes to making games where you feel like a badass. Well, that is until a chimera smashes you into the dirt like you're nothing.\n\nThe influence is clear from the beginning. Theres a normal and heavy attack, of course, and there is also a bunch of skills you can learn (from the innkeeper, strangely enough) depending on your weapon. Each vocation (the moniker used here for class) can only choose from a handful of weapons, such as sword/mace and shield for Fighter, Staff for Mage and so on.\nAt the beginning of the game you can only pick between Fighter, Strider (a mix of Rogue and Ranger) and Mage. Later, its possible to switch to an advanced vocation (such as Warrior, Ranger and Mage) or a hybrid vocation (Assassin, Magic Archer and Mystic Knight).\n\nMy main character fought in frantic melee combat with towering monsters which, if they catch you, will probably either crush you in their hands, hurl you a mile up in the air, or simply eat you. Theres even a jump attack and a few skills which launch enemies into the air; overall, it felt very satisfying to vanquish enemies as it required accurate attacks rather than simple button mashing.\n\n\nFinal thoughts:\nIn many ways, Dragons Dogma is a throwback to the old-school of gaming. There are very few directions compared to what were used to nowadays, which may be occasionally frustrating. For example, a few hours into my playthrough I found myself suffering at the hands of most enemies all of a sudden. I had found a lot of gold while roaming the land but not much loot, which left me in a ragtag of armor and weapons; as a last resource, I tried checking the NPC vendors (which in recent RPGs are usually outfitted with mediocre weapons and armor) to find something useful and sure enough, they had amazing stuff to sell me.\nThe graphics are well suited to a game released almost half a decade ago, but the compromise is it runs amazing.\nYou owe it to yourself to give this game a try.","January 19","true","38.6"," 63 of 71 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","63","71","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/367500/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Dragon's Dogma is a 3rd person RPG in where we take on the role of an Arisen, a being that has had his heart torn out by a dragon and are thus destined to face it again to try to reclaim it. Dragons are far from your only foes as the land is filled with other giant beasts that would love nothing more than to feast on you. You start off the game as a male Warrior Arisen that is on his way to face the dragon and this area serves as the tutorial. It shows off the mechanics of the game the game such as Lanterns to stave off the dark in caverns and will soon throw you right into the lion's den to learn through necessity. It is a cool way to start the game and shows off exactly what you can expect from it. After this sequence you are now able to build your character be they male or female and customize them to your liking. The really neat thing is that weight and height matter as skinnier folks will be pushed around by strong gusts of winds while fatter ones can easily traverse through it. Changes you make to your Arisen are noticeable and makes every character feel unique.\n\nAfter the initial sequence with the character you built you will now be able to choose from one of three classes which are the typical Stryder (rouge), Mage or Warrior classes though more will be unlocked later on. Pretty soon you will also be able to make a Pawn which is the only party member you can fully customize. The other two members of your party will be other players Pawns that do not level up with you and are often times made to appear very weird. Them not leveling up means that you will constantly be swapping them out for newer, higher level pawns. They can either be found wandering around the land or you can enter a Rift Stone to hold an audition and choose whichever pawn catches your eye. Having unique player created pawns roam the land is a really smart way to keep the areas from being nothing but enemies and barren lands. Your main pawn may also be hired by other players and in the process learn how to properly fight certain creatures, learn about unexplored lands and come back with items. When your pawn returns from being hired it will come back with some Rift Crystals which is a currency that is pretty much useless until you reach the DLC area. It has a very MMO like feel to it in that your party members are very greedy and will not stop talking.\n\nPawns will shout the same things over and over again which drove me insane, though luckily you can turn off pawn chatter in the options menu making them much more bearable. You may miss out on the pawn pointing out a few useful things but by the time they finally do say something of use it is likely you would have already snapped and threw your party members down a cliff. There is a button dedicated to picking up and throwing objects and it is a ton of fun. From flinging a vase at a random person to picking up your dying pawn and running to safety as a giant monster gives chase it just adds a lot to the amount of things you can experiment with. Not all places will be tolerant of you throwing random people down a flight of stairs and you will get immediately arrested by a guard with no option to run or fight. You will be teleported to the cells with nothing but prison rags and must pay 5000 gold to be released or you can escape by having a few skeleton keys and finding the secret exit. No matter the crime it will be 5000 gold so feel free to throw The Duke off a balcony without fear of a massive fine. Luckily money is very easy to come by in this game and 5k of gold is chump change allowing you to harass the citizens of that city and jump from rooftop to rooftop trying to avoid the guards that magically teleport you to prison once they catch you.\n\nPeople that are normal, unlike myself, will want to be going on quests and leveling up your character. There are plenty of side quests to take on but sadly most of them are plain tedious or boring. Your quest log will quickly fill up with pointless quests like killing a certain number of creature or collect certain amount of materials. Worse still are the ton of escort missions that have you walk across the map and protect someone which are massively time consuming. Monsters respawn so even if you just came through there it will be filled right back up with enemies to fight. Main quests don't fare much better and are also more than content to artificially lengthen themselves with pointless tasks. The story is barebones and uninteresting as well so that won't be a driving point. There is very little loot to keep you interested, leveling up seems to do nothing but give you a bit more health and it doesn't take too long to max out your class, leaving pretty much no incentive to push forward other than to see what new giant monster awaits.\n\nThis all only applies to the base game since the DLC area called Bitterblack Isle fixes all these issues such as no boring pointless quests, plenty of cool loot and it even has a semi interesting, self-contained story to boot. Going deeper and deeper down the dungeon is such a forbidding feeling since this game features a unique inventory system in where everything you pick up weighs something and the more you carry the slower you get. It is a really neat system that makes you think about what you take and if you are willing to sacrifice loot in order to be quicker on your feet against whatever deadly foe awaits. You could either stock up on life potions or only take the bare minimum as to more easily avoid taking damage in the first place. The base game has plenty of inns where you can store your stuff but in this the dungeon in the DLC is massive with only a few places to stock up and far deadlier than anything previously encountered. Capcom pulled a Ghosts and Goblins here and you must complete the dungeon twice in order to see the real ending. In the base game you have a decently sized open world with a full day and night system. At night zombies and other more powerful creatures roam the land and you must use your lantern in order to see anything. It is very immersive and spells really shine in this setting as they cast off light and cuts through the darkness in a spectacular matter. Makes it hard to see what is going on but that only serves to add to the chaotic feel of fighting in the darkness with nothing but a dimly lit lantern keeping the dark at bay.\n\nTo fast travel you must first find a “port crystal” then set it in a place you are likely to need to go back to and use a “ferrystone” to travel to the places you set them in. It is a genius way to get you to explore the land they designed as well as making it all the more satisfying when you build a decent fast travel system. Weather does not change sadly making the strong wind gimmick exclusive to a tiny area on the map. Running around uses up stamina so it is best to not let it get to low or you will be out of breath and nearly defenseless if you were to get ambushed. Skills use up stamina and so does the awesome mechanic of clinging on to a giant monster. While other games will simply have you hack at the ankles of a giant until it dies, Dragon's Dogma has you attempting to climb up a rampaging monster and finding a spot that causes more damage while hoping against hope your stamina doesn't run dry or getting smacked off of it and right down towards a fatal fall if you are unlucky. This game is not friendly and you will face creatures far superior to you in a desperate fight for survival and that is where this game truly shines like no other. The story, characters and quests may be boring but that thrill when you spot a foe that could easily kill you just by sneezing in your general direction yet you stubbornly remain and unsheathe your sword is one not to be missed.","February 5","true","57.0"," 62 of 70 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","62","70","5","1"

I feel now, that I am in the best possible position to write a review for this game as I have explored virtually all of it's content that it has to offer.\n\nI played this game on Xbox360 when it was first released back in 2012. I thought it was a pretty awesome game but I never got that far into it because I found it very differcult and it had a very minimal and frustrating fast-travel system. But this game had a very intriguing open-world and combat system. So when I heard that it was being released on PC earlier this year I got really excited and pre-ordered it and jumped straight into it on release-day.\nI was everything I had remembered plus more. The lack of fast-travel had been fixed and a great new system of travel had been implemented. The playing can aquire an item called "Portcrystals" that they can then place anywhere in the over-world and teleport to them as many times as they want. They can also be picked up and put down somewhere else. I really enjoyed this freedom to customise where I could instantly teleport to, put it didn't hinder my incentive to explore.\n\nI think this game probably has some of the best-looking combat in a video-game I've ever come across. The magic looks beautiful, the monsters you fight are huge and epic. It's a party-based game so you make up 1/4 of your team. The AI is extremely intelligent, and I found it quite refreshing to not have to do ALL the work in a combat situation.\n\nYour allies (referred to as "Pawns" in-game) are always activiely learning about quests as you do them and monsters as you fight them. This creates very dynamic gameplay. And I would always find myself being impressed with my parties capabilities during a fight or quest, whether it be casting a healing-spell or using their sheild to spring-board my assassin up onto the shoulders of an enemy cyclopes or gathering herbs or mining ore and so-on...\n\nThis game offers the usually aspects of a good RPG: gathering / crafting, exploration, NPC relationships, dialogue choices, class ranks and a character level range from 1-200.\n\nThe story is absolutely fantastic and I was blown-away at how everything all added up at the end of my first playthrough. This game is based around the player completing subsequent playthroughs to get through some of the end-game content. And what's really impressive is that it actually manages to tie it all in with it's lore and story.\nOn my first playthrough, I thought some of the events that happened as part of the story were a bit weird and ambiguous, but as soon as I finished my first playthrough it all made sense and everything had it's purpose.\n\nThe Steam version of Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen includes the expansion which is basically a differcult mega-dungeon aimed at players who are progressing through the late-game. It has a very Dark Souls feel to it.\n\nOverall, I would give this game a  9 / 10\nThe graphics are still beautiful and the combat is some of the most impressive and dynamic and epic I've come across in a video-game. I have some great memories of playing this game and I would recommend it to any RPG fan or Skyrim fan looking for something a bit more hardcore but found Dark Souls too differcult :P","February 8","true","168.7"," 58 of 65 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","58","65","3","0"

Dragons and other large beasts have their own unique body language, it takes more than just spamming magic/swinging your sword all the time while gulping down potions while not moving at all from your spot.\nMonsters in DDDA are agile, cunning and getting hit by them will make you fly. The Monsters react ver clearly to your hits and so do you. You can cling to a griffon while it's about to take off and send it crashing down by making it flinch while flying. You can destroy specific body parts of monsters to weaken their range of movement and attackm or to get rare loot. Burn a Griffon's wings and he won't fly.

Are you worried about buying a game that stems from the last Playstation generation? Don’t worry any further... get the game and love it\n\nDragon's Dogma is the perfect mix between classical Capcom Action-Adventures like Devil May Cry or Onimusha, mixed with the atmosphere of the Dark Souls series, the boss fight mechanic of Shadow of Colossus, classical JRPG status / level up system, huge dragons and collecting mechanic like in Skyrim, the freedom and vast world of MMOs…\n\nAnd the good news, it is not generic and a simple mix or copy of all those games, but has its unique style and atmosphere.\n\nI have never played the PS3 version. So I got excited, when I heard that DDA would come as a complete package (+ DLCs) to PC. I was bit worried about the old school graphics, but then I read and heard a lot from people saying it is their favourite game of the whole PS3 generation. Strong statement!\n\nPRO\nCombat system -- it plain and simple feels right. Every single fight is exciting, even against some pack of wolves. It might sound first a bit easy to slash and hack like in Devil May Cry, but later you find out that there is a lot more to the combat mechanics. The boss fights are a highlight of the game. It is seldom that you fight a big boss under 20 minutes -- trying to get on his back, to his head, stabbing him in the eyes, helping your pawns (AI team mates). You will enjoy them a lot.\n\nAtmosphere & Sound -- epic music during fights. The atmosphere can be best compared to Dark Souls... it is the same kind of anxiety, surrealism. Big castles, a lot of ruins, black forests, windy valleys, etc …\n\nCharacter development  – plenty of possibilities, different armour parts, armour enhancement, fair level-up system with reasonable status change,  different fighting abilities which can be added as primary or secondary attack.\n\nKeyboard and mouse control works  – change the controls as you wish with secondary mouse buttons supported.\n\nSeems to be easy moddable  – first mods already out.\n\nAlmost perfect 3D VISION SUPPORT  – It is the RE engine, so the 3D vision support is good to excellent. You just need to change in the config.ini (CAPCOM folder under hidden folders DataApps) Stereo=ON (it is OFF by default). First fix already available to disable shadows.\n\nPAWNS  – Game is known for them and it is a great idea. You can share secondary characters / companion (fully modifiable). Nice idea and good AI in general.\nWhat I do not like so far or what is not so great\nEternal loading screen  – only real negative point. Saving and Loading takes an eternity, even on my fresh defragmented SSD.  PLEASE PATCH THIS CAPCOM.\n\nGraphic options  – yes, they are better than on any console and yes it is actually a good port in this respect. But only having the possibility between low and high in most of the graphic options is not enough (shadows for example). On PC I expect to turn off some effects completely.\n\nGraphic  – in general are old school. There could have been done a bit more and in combination with the loading screen I am bit puzzled.\n\nStory and dialogues  – I mostly do not bother to read the dialogues. They are boring and the story is far from interesting. The Witcher does this, as we all know, perfect but thanks to the great combat system in DDA you are not willing to lose any more time to the story anyways.\n\nFeeling being lost  – on the one hand I like to wander around, explore the vast world by myself, finding for example a little boss or a hidden cave, and all of this without being force to follow the main string of the story. Just like in Skyrim. On the other hand it is sometimes a bit difficult to know where the next benchmark in the storyline is. The map can only be activated via the main menu (ESC and then E) and the mini-map isn’t very useful. This could have been done better. But it is not such big deal and supports in the end the exploration aspect of the game.\nIS IT A GOOD PORT?\nYes, I think so. The developers took care of some PC specific issues in the different options. The game still needs some patches for the performance (my specific case with 3D vision and an older CPU), but would work for the classical 2D, non-VR gamer without problems. Considering the age of the game, a good performance port was absolutely expected. Controls are also perfectly fine. Some menu controls are weird though (backspace for save).\n\nI highly recommend this game. I played it straight for a couple of hours. It was great fun to get into the mechanics, the combat system and by being constantly surprised with amazing boss fights. No reason to wait for a sale and considering the age of the game. It is now or never.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SolNeko/recommended/367500/","SolNeko","SolNeko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SolNeko/","127 products in account","The only game that plays truly how you picture a medieval fantasy game.This is one of my favourite games of all time, it has a few flaws however this game is the beginning of the "perfect game" for me.\nDragons Dogma Dark Arisen is a great PC port of a standalone expansion/re-release that comes with all previous DLC the console versions had making it the best way to play and experience this game.\n\nThis game is a standard action adventure game with an open world that has RPG elements, You create a character and a pawn (rentable shareable party members) with a large amount of customization options including height and weight which influence your stats and abilities and can select from a range of classes that have different playstyles and alter your stat progression, Play as a Warrior? gain lots of attack power but very few magic power, play as a Sorcerer and get the opposite, these stats determine the amount of damage you deal or receive among other things and can allow you to build your character by experiencing classes you would otherwise never use, for example the Magick Archer is an insane Archer/Thief like class with both daggers and a bow however it may use staves and magic allowing you to perform amazing attacks like summoning homing arrows, magical bow shots or even setting yourself on fire, You may not enjoy playing as a mage class but going through and putting the effort in to be extremely effective in a hybrid class that has your favourite playstyle is rewarding.\n\nClasses play exactly as you expect them to unlike most games, you don't whiff enemies and deal damage to them, you actually hit them and they react, Fighters have shields and swords and can block enemy attacks as well as bash their shield to taunt enemies into attacking them as well as many other things such as using their shield as a platform and launching a party member into the air to reach a flying enemy, Warriors with their Two handed weapons actually feel like they have a huge weapon in their hands, they're slow and powerful and each time you swing you cut through the enemy multiple times doing multiple hits per a single a swing and you can really feel the weight of the weapon, these guys knock anyone down and charge up to the fullest the most powerful blows that really do completely knock an enormous dragon off its legs.\nArcher classes have Daggers for quick melee strikes and a bow they can fully aim unlike most games and focus their attacks on any point of an enemies body, aim for a cyclops eye to blind them or aim for an enemies head for the most damage or other weak points to gain an advantage.\nMagic classes can cast quick spells and charged up spells depending on the situation and do enormous amount of damage or play supportive by enchanting your parties weapons with an element the enemy is weak against or debilitate them with status effects, heal your party or even use some really crazy spells like summon a whip made of lightning and use it as if you were a melee orientated class with its own moveset.\nEach class features different skills or shared skills as well as passive augments you can learn that can be carried over to different classes which lets you make the out of the class system by learning all the augments and using the most effective augments you have found with a class that can take advantage of them for example, working through the Warrior class to gain an augment that increases your defense will be beneficial when playing as a mage who will have to remain stationary for some spells.\n\nA great feature and what really makes this game stand out for me and what makes it amazing as well as the classes and playstyles is the amount of things you can interact with in this game and how you can interact with them, You can pick up and carry on your shoulder 99% of every humanoid and even non humanoids, this can be helpful to throw them out of danger, throw them at enemies to damage them, throw them off a cliff to kill them, carry them to safety, drag them with you if they're being a pain in the ♥♥♥ or even to solve pressure plated switches and navigate better through heavy winds.\nThis grab feature can also be used in many other ways, you can jump and grab onto a harpy and hold onto them and direct them as they fly to gain new vantage points and you can yank a few types of them down depending on how much your character weighs or how many items you are carrying.\nYou can grab onto enormous enemies like Cyclopes, Ogres, Golems, Giant Wolves, Demons, Beholders, Dragons and even Death himself and are able to control where you move on their body and attack specific points of their body without silly QTE's, you have full control as you jump onto a flying dragons tail, climb up and stab it in the heart and brace for impact as you hold onto it as it falls to the ground.\nYou can pick up crates and barrels and pots that you find around and throw them at enemies, many of which may contain items you can collect or may be explosive, you may pick up a pot full of oil and throw it at a cyclops and then use a fire spell or throw a bomb at him to ignite him in flames for extra damage.\nThe grab system is so satisfying and makes it really feel like a grand adventure as you fight large and small monsters in ways you would only see normally through a silly cutscene.\nThe game features a standard inventory system with items that have different weights, the more items you have the more they weigh you down and slow your movement but can also have other properties like making you heavier and more harder to knock down, if you find yourself holding too many items you can give them to your party members to use or to keep hold for you until you reach town to place it all into storage.\n\nMany of the items you find in the game all have uses as you can combine items to create new ones, you can create grenades with things you find around for in the open or in caves and make potions or special arrows or spell tomes and many more as well as being able to use these items to upgrade your gear and weaponry.\nSpeaking of gear and weaponry there is an extremely large selection of gear and weaponry to choose from, some armor and weapons are only available for use by certain classes, these items all have unique designs and makes choosing armor and weapons like a fashion show as you try to make the best looking or most badass character you can while making sure you have the best stats, however at some point stats may not mean anything to you if you are skilled enough or built your character in a way where they don't need any armor or can make sacrifices for fashion, armor and weapons may also come enchanted with properties that allow you to ignore or resist status effects or to deal elements of damage or status effects too.\n\nThe game world is decently sized and full of enemy encounters, wandering party members you can hire, chests, caves, places to forage and mine and was made in mind to be played without fast travel for the most part, the re-release made fast travel more accessible however originally it was expensive in order to allow you to make the most out of the world and explore and find new quests, gear and materials, fast travel is much more accessible with the addition of the Eternal Ferrystone and additional Portcrystals which are items you will find throughout the game that you can literally place almost anywhere in the game and teleport to them, place it on top of a tower and you can teleport exactly to that place.\nThe story is hit and miss, its standard for a straight medieval fantasy game and all you ever really need from it but it also has some twists and turns you may not expect that can be really interesting and some storylines you can check if you explore side-quests.\n\nThis game has hours upon hours of content and I'm at the word limit, this game is great. we need a sequel that will elaborate further and help make possibly the best Adventure game ever.","February

I also plan to play the game through again to get to all the stuff I missed and the ultimate ending.\n\nDragon's Dogma is a triumph of what all RPGs should aspire to be. Solid, challenging gameplay, classes that not only all play differently, but all feel powerful and fun to use in their own right, great enemy and boss design and unique game mechanics. I am yet to see a game that does many of the things DDDA does, let alone does so well.\n\nThe pawn system, where each player designs their own constant companion that other players can then take into their game to help them out,  is a great way to make up for the player's weaknesses in a fun and original way while encouraging creativity, co-operation and competition. Each player can try to create the best pawn for their playstyle, or just a fun, creative character to represent them. The more the pawn plays with you or someone else, the more knowledgeable and smart they become.\n\nThe game really shines, however, in its battle mechanics. The player has so many techniques at their disposal with the skills and augments system, the different classes, and teamwork with your party. You can jump on and climb large enemies to attack their weakpoints directly, or magic users can create platforms there. You can disable different parts of an enemy or inflict debilitating status effects. I'm constantly impressed by how fluid and fast the combat is, and am always discovering new things you can do in combat. In some ways it feels like an MMO, where you work out a strategy for dealing with certain beasts or difficult rooms, and then your entire party works together to accomplish it. The ambush system, where powerful enemies can sometimes appear at random to throw a wrench in your plans, makes every encounter fresh.\n\nI preordered this at launch for essentially half price, because of money I earned selling marketplace items, but even if I had gotten it at full price, it's made up its worth in dollars per hour thrice already.\n\nA great soundtrack is the icing on the cake in what's a fun, exciting game that will ruin your expectations for every other RPG.","March 8","true","91.5"," 55 of 66 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","55","66","3","0"

Wolves hunt in packs!"), and a generic fantasy setting. Wow, sounds terrible doesn't it? This is the third time I've purchased this game. The first time was the original release back on Xbox, then again on the PS3 with the added content, and finally again on pc, my preferred platform.\n\nThe gameplay more than makes up for the other faults of the game. Those are just some of the issues. There is also not one but two clunky menus, some irritating escort quests, and lots of kill x and bring y to z quests. But it is the process of doing these quests, of getting to a mountain only to have a chimera land on your head and force you and your pawns into a frantic battle of survival that makes the game fun.\n\nThen night time comes around and the dead rise from their graves, bandits come out, gryphons smash you from the sky, and everything happens all a once while you summon a tornado and your lantern goes out...what will happen next??\n\nSomething different always happens along the way, and the game is super fun.

I'll list them all below of why I enjoy Dragon's Dogma so much! About time I put the mouse down for a while to write and praise this game. Keep in mind, I didn't play this game when it was first released and simply just picked it up when it's finally released on PC. (And also broken English.)\n\nWonderful setting with romantic chivalry and choices that matters!This game has classic and romantic chivalry style story. I'm talking about old school peasant rising to hero while having a little nobility romance on the side and surviving the court full of snobbish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s sorta feel, something like Berserk: The Golden Age Arc. It also leans more towards dark fantasy with all the really dark night and dangerous monster lurking in the shadow that gets pretty brutal with their way or smashing the crap out of you. The story not that detailed and rich with lore, leaving so much question behind but still very enjoyable. The choices you make in each quest (that's not finding X or killing X enemies) REALLY MATTERS! If you pick the wrong choice or take the main story to take the whole setting to a complete stage you might not be able to complete some of the quest! So explore as much as possible before you take on a main story quest! Each state also offers many new things! It has an 'Ok' voice acting, I'm not completely moved by it, sometimes confusing old English, horrible lip-sync... might as well read the subtitles instead of looking at the NPC faces... also the harpies are total ********. D:<\n\nAll the soothing sounds and music ♥The music is beautiful and really suiting the situations... great environment sounds, pretty realistic when you try to track down monsters' location.\n\nOne of the best combat systems ever created!It has really really REALLY fun combat system. Everything goes so fast and full of actions. You can battle and react to gigantic bosses realtime! Climb on it, hang on to it while smackign the crap out of it. It is just super fricken EPIC. The spells are visually strong like how a massive attackign spell should be, but also very beautiful, so if you plan on playing a sorcerer, you won't be disappointed! Get ready for some of the awesome glamorous spell effects waiting for you. All the classes give you almost completely different flavors. Oh! Almost forgot to mention, JUMPING PUZZLES!!! If you play classes with acrobatic skills like Strider or Assassins, you'll get to go Assassin's Creed all over the cities and ruins as well!\n\nNot this gen graphics but still very beautifulThe setting is really beautiful for a game made in 2012. From what I see, it only had a bit of graphic enhancement, no big terrain error that I notice, looking really nice overall. Bunch of repeatable dungeons with different atmospheres which you can venture into for gears and bosses farming.\n\nDetailed character customization!The character creation is also pretty nice, it's more of a picking different parts, put together and a bit of slider here and there. You can make nice character out of it, from loli-size to SHE-HAWK to super skinny nerd, and you can still adjust parts of it in-game as well. If you want to complete edits of your character there's also an item you can purchase using your RC, for more details, read the wikia.\n\nDumb Waifu ai is dumb...I mean pawns...The pawn system can be really tricky sometimes but nothing beats creating and travel through the whole game with your fully customized waifu. You can rent other people's pawn to join your party or borrow your friends and you both get the benefit from having your pawn adventuring in other people's game, such as RC points and experience your pawn received from battling some monsters and doing quest in other game to aid you in your own game later on. However, the pawn AI can be extremely unreliable sometimes, mostly of the time I find the tank and other none magic user class very useful but sorcerers and mages can get really bugged out on which spell to cast or overall not casting at all... just runs around jumping and freaking out... while you're fighting a really big guy that only take 2-3 sorcerers' spells to take down but instead take 20 minutes longer smacking it with melee classes instead... and no, you can't romance with your Pawn... use your imagination instead. :'(\n\nOnly 1 save file...One thing that I really dislike about the game is the save. YOU CAN ONLY HAVE 1 SAVE FILE! Unless you go to Userdata and back those saves up in different folder, yes it's do-able.\n\nTL;DR GET THIS GAME!! IT'S REALLY GOOD!!!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is what I'd like to add after 300+hours of playing\nDO NOT READ ANYTHING BELOW IF YOU WANT REAL CHALLENGE OF NOT KNOWING\nWHAT TO EXPECT IN BITTERBLACK ISLE!\n- Purification, Bitterblack Armor lv3 and rare tier armors farming will change the way you see this game... It went from I enjoy epic boss fight to f♥♥♥ you RNG.\n- Godsbane will be your best friend until you're strong enough to make Daimon your b♥♥♥♥.\n- Spellcaster Pawns are extremely stupid, use them at your own risk. 'Tis may be because of the casting time, it confuses them most of the time, instead of actually cast something or even do anything at all, they'll only be jumping around... to the point of falling into the abyss. Melee and range attack pawn are much more reliable. Unless you want an unkillable Pawn to be a meatshield then slap a Legion's Might on your pawn and let em jump around like a good bait.\n- Death knows... he won't show up when you are all geared up to kill him even when you bait him out, but when you're not ready, he will show up a lot to mutilate your pawns just for the lulz.\n- You'll no longer want to open any chest yourself... let your pawns open them for you...\n- I still love this game after all these frustrations.","January 25","true","437.7"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","97","30","31","8","0"

Hoping it would come to PC, which it eventually did. Also this version includes the DLC adding a whole new area to explore.\n\nThe combat plays like a forgiving Dark Souls with the use of other players pawns (AI NPCs) as well as your own helping out. Large Monsters will have different combat styles and weaknesses. The battles against these foes can be quite epic. Although there are standard mobs to fight along the way as well.\n\nYou can customise your character and Pawn class throughout the game, allowing for different play styles as you wish. The Pawn system is great as it allows limited interaction with other players and their worlds but without them getting in the way by stealing your loot or swearing too much.\n\nThe story is good enough to keep you playing and the fight against the dragon does not dissapoint. There are quite a few optional quests to follow, that I would recommend playing through as they all have good stories. Although sometimes it is not always clear where to go with a new quest.\n\nThe fast travel system works quite well with two key locations but stones you can pick up to create more. There are certain key places these are need to make the game less of a chore, so be careful. You also get an etrnity stone to teleport you, so keep this safe.\n\nI completed one playthrough but had barely touched the DLC, so have started another and headed to the new island to explore, hunting some achievements along the way. The difficulty here isscaled to an end game character, so be careful early on.\n\nIf you are a fan of Dark Fantasy and Japanese style games like Dark Souls I would highly recommend.","February 2","true","43.3"," 42 of 53 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","42","53","5","0"

A must have 4 year old classic that ages very well with its current art style and hopefully will be for the days to come.\n\nPros:\n\nPawn System( When each player starts the game, they not only create their own charater. but a side kick that will not only help the player but also travel accross other worlds to aid other players accross the world.)\n\nRift Credits( When a players pawn is rented out by another player, they earn rift credits and gifts from other players, which they can spend mainly on the dark arisen expansion for epic gear, as well on other ods and ends at a certain encampment early game. Because of this, you should equip your pawn with only the best gear, so people rent out your pawn more, therfore gaining the player even more rift credits.)\n\nCombat system( Between the many different switchable classes at anytime, and the ability to climb giant monsters, and nighttime being really dangerous for a newer player, plus the solid combat it self, Dragons Dogma nails the combat department on the head.)\n\nLots of gear and loot( especially with the newely added dark arisen expansion, soooo manny chesstsss)\n\nStory is kind of a toss up, overall, the concept is really cool and I guess very well implemented in a americanized japanize way?\n\nEnviroments are really really cool and imersive, but basic.\n\nMusic is pretty awsome.\n\n\nCons:\n\nLip movment is nothing to sing about( to be fair it is a older game)\n\nStory is a toss up, it has a lot of alternate endings and such. A personal opinion really.\n\nAlot of basic go do this and escort quests. However, there are still some very long quests with rewarding story and gameplay leading up to them.\n\n\n\nOverall a really solid game which saddens me to see around 200 negative reviews for such a awsome product, come on guys lets up those positive reviews!!!!\n","January 26","true","134.5"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","23","26","2","0"

However this was an expection, and probably one of the best I have made with games.\n\nFrom the very start, you can feel this game is close to alot of other titles in features and gameplay, namely Dark Souls. However it also grabbed my attention in other ways, such as the landscape, soundtracks and general feel of the game, that made it feel a bit like Zelda in those aspects, which was quite suprising.\n\nGetting down to the game itself, the graphics, I wouldn't say, is 'stunning' but the scenery is very beautiful and the way certain locations are compositioned gives it alot more quality. Character customization is fairly lengthy if you chose to edit the facial, body, stance and voice features of your said character, though it felt a bit lacking, in that certain customizable things such as the hair and body could have been expanded upon.\n\nThe gameplay as I mention before, feels alot like Dark Souls so not much to be said there. The animation most of the time is fluid and looks p. good. Though the apparently 'battle defining' feature of climbing a creature to get to its vital points feel more like someone went and modded it into the base game, as it produces some strange character placement bugs when climbing certain enemies.\n\nThe soundtrack and audio fidelity of the game is p. good in my opinion, having alot of customization in your characters voice, the soundtracks adding alot of character to many of the areas and the overall effects are nice.\n\nTo sum it all up in basic -/10 format;\n\nGraphics (Objects, meshes, textures): 7.5/10\n\nCombat: 8/10\n\nSound: 9/10\n\nStoryline(obviously haven't finished yet): 7/10\n\nOverall, I think this game deserves a 8/10 because it does feel very nice to play, look at and listen to. If you enjoy hording loot, farming monsters, completing quests, working your way towards a main questline and playing with an interesting AI and Combat system, then this game is probably for you :).","January 15","true","3.7"," 36 of 49 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","36","49","5","0"

They were black blurs to me!) and no letterboxing, there is also the option to mute pawns if you get tired of them, There's probably more stuff I can't remember now. As for content the game comes with the base game and the Dark Arisen expansion which brought balance changes, new items and a new explorable area which I didn't get to explore on console but I hear it's pretty difficult. A bunch of the armor and weapon DLCs are also included, you also get the eternal ferrystone which allows you to teleport to portcrystals but doesn't disappear after using it. However there is some content missing from the original version, the main menu theme song, Into Free, japanese voice over and the armor sets from the manga Berserk\n\nThe game tries to be an open world game but it remains mostly linear, getting too immersed in exploration while straying out of the roads might make you feel otherwise though, most of the scenery consists in mountains and forests, there is only one city (pretty much your base since it's where you change classes, get most missions and where the masterworksweapon shop is) but there is also a small fisherman village and a couple strongholds and ruined castles out there, and of course there can be no medieval fantasy RPG without dungeons or caves\n\nSo, you are a normal person living in a fisherman village and one day a huge dragon comes from the sky and attacks, you fight it but it steals your heart, the physical way and you become the Arisen and can command warriors known as Pawns who obey your every command\n\nInto the gameplay, you have a light attack, strong attack and then by holding your trigger buttons you can use your skills, can equip up to 6, simple right? It is for the small enemies, when you are fighting cyclopes, chimeras or drakes you might want to climb on them ala Shadow of the Colossus and start poking at their weak points if any. A big component of the game are the Pawns, they are indeed your fellow party members, but they learn from you, from how to do quests or what are enemies vulnerable to to imitate your behavior, if a pawn sees you holding an enemy down, they will start doing so when playing a melee class, the most common imitated behavior will be how you climb and where you attack big enemies. You are the hero of this adventure and as such if you die it's game over, but if they do you can revive them infinitely, you have your main Pawn and can hire 2 more from other players, of course, expect them to be pretty talkative, they say important stuff however\n\nLike most RPGs, Dragon's Dogma has a class system, there are 3 classes with 2 tiers each and then 3 hybrid classes (Arisen only) the classes are fighter (sword & board) warrior (greatsword, 3 skills only), mage (healing, support and minor attack magic), sorcerer (offensive and devastating magic like meteors and tornadoes), strider (daggers and shortbow) ranger (daggers and long bow with a focus on longer distance and stronger arrows) assassin (sword/daggers + bow/shield), mystik knight (swords/maces + magic shields/staves, unlike fighter, MK shield skills are more based on parries) and magick archer (daggers + magic bow/staff, homing, bouncing arrows). To unlock classes and skills you need to earn Discipline Points by killing monsters, you can change classes at the Gran Soren inn for free after you unlock them so no need to feel pressured, when you gain a character level your stats growth will depend on your active class, for example you gain more stamina as strider but more magic as mage, however it's mostly about the gear and the level cap is 200 (stat gain halves from 101-200)\n\nIn conclusion, this game is flawed and probably even rushed but it's well worth a try, it has action based combat, bg monster climbing, good archery, manual spell aiming mages and can summon huge meteors, what's not to like? ask the people who bashed it for not being Skyrim, but they probably didn't even play it\n\n","January 17","true","39.3"," 36 of 50 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","36","50","3","2"

And the quests are actual quests that feel fleshed-out and interesting rather than just being "talk to NPC, talk to other NPC, kill all the people in one room, talk to NPC."  Instead, you actually go on a QUEST, you explore a mysterious dungeon with new threats that you haven't come across before, new tactics you can employ, and so on.\n\nThis is just such a good game and a model of what these games ought to be.","January 30","true","138.9"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","0"

After I played over 20 hours expecting it to get great any moment, it never did. It has some great ideas but most of them just fall flat. Rather than give a long winded review, I'll list my likes and dislikes below to summarise.\n\nDislikes:\n\n* Boring side quests - Mostly fetch and escort quests\n* Poorly told main storyline without much character development or in depth RPG storytelling\n* Lack of rewards for exploration - I saw chests in hard to reach places multiple times or hidden away, I opened them excitedly to find.. some basic healing potion? -_-\n* Loot - after 20 hours I think I found one gear upgrade to the stuff I'd already bought at the blacksmith. Even in hidden away places, useful loot was nowhere to be found.\n* The huge expansive world was just trees, rocks, water over and over again. There was no interesting changes of scenery or hidden amazing places to see. Every cave was just a cave with a few monsters in it.\n* Average voice acting\n* Character animations and mouth sync were just.. worse than any other open world RPG I've played.\n\nLikes:\n\n* Combat is responsive, has great variety and feels well polished.\n* Magic classes can do some really cool looking spells. Probably cooler than any other game I've seen before.\n* Fighting large enemies has an interesting mechanic which requires you to climb them. I must say it does feel a bit janky in practice though.\n* You're not tied to a class, you can switch any time at no real penalty and for free after you've already done it once. The game encourages this.\n* The pawn system is really cool. You can recruit followers and they learn what to do based on your actions in/out of combat. For example, they learnt that goblins were weak to flame so they always buffed my weapon with fire. That was pretty impressive.\n* The climbing of ledges and stuff when scaling buildings/mountains is well polished.\n* Fighting animations look great.\n* The game has barely much of a tutorial system at first glance, but if you listen, your pawns actually give you a lot of advice about the world in your travels. This is a very organic way of teaching/helping the player and maintains immersion quite well. I'd like to see this concept in more games.\n\nAll in all, the game has so many great mechanics and concepts which makes the game fun.. at first. But after that, you need a world worth exploring and a story worth following. Dragons Dogma offers neither.","January 25","false","20.6"," 225 of 384 people (59%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","59","225","384","13","33"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/367500/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","212 products in account","Dozens of feet up, my gauntlets digging into the mane of a livid griffin, I knew I'd made a huge mistake. The beast was grounded when I'd hopped atop his back in the hopes of introducing his eyes to my sword, but he'd shot up so high afterwards that I could have seen the main character's hometown if I'd dared to look (and if it popped in in time). One slip, one splat, and it'd be game over. Below, though, a mage's spell set my group's weapons aflame. My ranger companion let loose a mighty arrow, alighting the monster's wings and bringing us slamming back to earth.\n\nI already knew how all this would end: I spent many sleepless nights with Dragon's Dogma's appealing mix of Western RPG stylings and Monster Hunter-inspired combat years ago when it first dropped for the Xbox 360. Graphics have advanced, scores of better and lesser RPGs have come and gone, but there on the stones of the Bluemoon Tower, I still relished the return of the same rush of victory that overcame me in 2012.\n\nNow, at last, we have the PC port, which takes its guise from 2013's Dark Arisen, a retooled version of the initial release with a ridiculously tough endgame zone and numerous tweaks to various annoyances. It's a port, all right, which is to say that it's here and it does little to distinguish itself from its console forebears aside from nifty features like better textures and uncapped framerates. (A single crash over 50 hours aside, it ran beautifully.) Still, that's cause for celebration. Scarred with imperfections but entertaining to the end, Dragon's Dogma is easily one of the most memorable RPGs of the last decade.\n\nIt achieves this distinction almost in spite of its story. It's not bad, and it's capped on one end by a dragon who eats your heart as though he's sucking Nutella off his claw and on the other by a deliciously bizarre conclusion preceding the New Game that still makes for good discussions when less than sober. In between, though, it relies excessively to backtracking and indulges too many humdrum sidequests. It clings to predictable Western RPG conventions: in one corner there's the dastardly secret society, in another, the artifact-stuffed ruin.\n\nIt works, though, because it's all told with enthusiastic gravitas. For all the chimeras and dragons, Gransys is a land that tries to stick to the real, favoring utilitarian armor designs over flamboyance, and the interactions impart a dutiful ‘let's do this’ sense I admire. This extends even to the open-world landscape, which boasts coastal cliffs, mountains, and towering Norman architecture but never quite inspires the kind of visual rapture you get from, say, The Witcher 3. (Worse, it's prone to pop-ins and muddy details at long distances.) Saving the world is a job, dang it, and Dragon's Dogma makes you feel it.\n\nJobs can be fun, of course, and Dragon's Dogma delivers a challenging brand of action that's rousing regardless of whether it's played on the keyboard or with a gamepad. Greatswords crash with hefty weight, arrows fly with satisfying thwapps, and spells impale ogres with icy tendrils. So many RPGs could learn from how fun this is. The appeal isn't just the fighting (which could benefit from a lock-on); it's also the way it lets you scramble up the arms of cyclopes and slice off the tails of lizard men. Sick of one of the main three classes of Fighter, Strider, and Mage? You can easily switch out to another and level its skills or those of six hybrids. Some fare better than others; Warriors, for instance, perform pitifully in Dragon's Dogma's many ranged encounters.\n\nDragon's Dogma still feels enjoyably unique four years on.\nEnter the pawns. Nothing sets Dragon's Dogma apart quite like them. They're mysterious beings with classes and skills that fill the blanks of what you need, thus allowing my Warrior to bring along, say, a bow-toting Ranger, a healing Mage, and a powerful Sorcerer—for a price. You get a main pawn that other players can summon, and you can summon up to two of theirs as well. There's a satisfying Pokémon-like appeal to trying them out (which you'll need to since they don't level with you), and having to let go of a well-geared, well-skilled pawn sometimes stings like the death of a fleshed-out character in another RPG. Alas, they're prone to spouting obvious, ceaseless chatter such as "These stairs serve as a useful route in their own right," but happily Dark Arisen lets you switch that off.\n\nIf that's what it takes, do it. It's rough in parts, and numerous other RPGs tell a better story or inspire greater awe. But Dragon's Dogma still feels enjoyably unique four years on and that's something few of its genre cousins can claim. And the best thing I can say? Even now, I'm already itching to get back in.\n\n1 of 4\nDragon's dogma 1\n\n\n\n\nTHE VERDICT\n81/100\nAbout PC Gamer reviews\nDragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen\nThe PC port doesn't introduce much new and certain elements could be stronger, but Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen still shines as a uniquely enjoyable RPG.","April 3","true","7.6"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","23","29","3","1"

Right about that time I was leaving the military. I was ♥♥♥♥ing hooked on that game. Because of DD, I stayed up all night playing, and slept during the day. This damn game consumed my life, and because of it, I couldn't have a regular sleep schedule for 4 months. I ended up buying a whole new game when Dark Arisen  came out, and damn did they up the difficulty of the game. The DLC itself isn't recommended right away until you leveled up a bit. Especially if you play on hard mode. It's slow at first, but picks up quick. The choice of classes are all great, as well. The story confused me a bit, but only because I would play at night, and on mute. This is one of the only games that have made me ♥♥♥♥ing cry.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yamalight/recommended/367500/","yamalight","yamalight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yamalight/","1769 products in account","Dragon's Dogma is a third-person action RPG made by a japanese company for a western market.\nIt has pretty solid combat, that was obviously borrowed from Demon/Dark Souls series (not as hard though). There are some crazy big monsters and beasts that were definitely inspired by Monster Hunter. And there's that ability to grab and climb onto large monsters from Shadow of Colossus. Plus some RPG elements that are quite common in japanese games, but were re-shaped to resemble western ones.\nSounds a bit strange, but plays pretty damn awesome. At least mechanically.\n\nStory-wise it's quite plain - as most of JRPGs the main story is quite linear. Side quests are mostly plain as well - go kill those guys, bring that thing, nothing exciting here. The writing (or maybe translation?) is not fantastic as well, so after some time playing, you'll forget about most of the quests at all.\nWhich is fine, because the combat is still fantastic.\n\nLoot system works in a very similar way to Souls games - there's a limited number of weapons and armor, but almost every one is a significant upgrade over the old ones. You can also use money and gathered materials to upgrade your gear - that's quite important too.\n\nYou also have pawns (minions/followers) to help you. You'll create one yourself and will be tasked with watching over her - getting better equip, buying and assigning skills, leveling up, and all that other stuff.\nAnd then you'll have a way to hire two more pawns to help you - either of same level as you for free, or higher level for some RCs (which drops from mobs). All hired pawns was made by someone else (your pawn can get hired too!). Hired pawns don't level up, so you need to change them frequently.\nThe cool bit is that if you hire pawns that already completed that quest, they'll actually help you with some tips and guidance.\nAnnoying bit is constant chatter and "wolves hunt in pack!" stuff (which you luckily can turn off in options menu).\n\nDownsides, aside from plain (maybe even boring) storyline/quests include a couple of minor things like dated UI (the game was after all originally released in 2013), a bit wonky camera in places and not-that-HD graphics (which hopefully will get fixed by some crazy modders in future).\n\nIf that sounds like your kind of game - grab it. It's probably the most epic RPG about fighting large monsters I'd played. If you only want story - I wouldn't bother with this one.\n\nA bit more detailed look at mechanics and combat in video below:\nhttps://youtu.be/8tfF3JrVnsM","January 19","true","13.9"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","11"

Running around, exploring the world, encountering epic battles wherever you go. It’s a sandbox done right. Combat feels good, Combat Animations feel good. The pawn system feels good as well. The player creates his own party member (pawn) that will follow him throughout the entire game and can be leveled and skilled just like the player character due to a very extensive class (vocation) system. The players main pawn can then be summoned by other players into their game to receive additional skillpoints and knowledge about the world like quests, monsters and locations. Two more party members (pawns) of other players can be summoned into your game as well. That way you can adjust your party depending on the situation or travels you undertake.\n\nThe Bad\nYou can over level easily! If the player explores too much or fulfills all available side quests before entering certain story quests then it can happen that the story quests are laughable easy. This took away the challenge to accomplish the main story. For example: The player can fight a Griffith (giant bird monster) in the open field and later encounters one as part in a story quest in which this easily in 2 minutes defeatable Griffith is pictured as undefeatable foe due to the scripted quests progression.\n\nA ton of items! There are hundreds of items in the game. Each can be combined to create new or different items. There is so much of them that the player will feels overwhelmed at first. The more you explore the vast amount of item combinations you will figure out that most of the items you can create are useless stuff you might never gonna use on your travels.\n\nThe Ugly\nCharacters the player meets during the main story or the side quests are boring as hell! Throughout the entire game I gave a ♥♥♥♥ about those characters. Badly written quests and characters invite to simply skip the obsolete dialog and just do what the quest marker tells you to do! If Dragon’s Dogma 2 will happen, then I hope they will increase the writing and the likeability of the presented characters.\n\nYou can only have one savegame! Which means you can only play one character. If you want to start a new game or Hard or Speedrun Mode then you will need to delete your existing character to start all over. To avoid this you have to locate the savegame and copy it somewhere else otherwise you will lose the character and the progress you made with it. Bad move Capcom!\n\nWhy Recommended?\nIf not the characters or main quests but the gameplay is what carries the game!  Capcom created great gameplay mechanics like the combat, class & pawn system. Even though some items seem useless, experimenting with items and item combinations can be fun regardless of the outcome. Once you got the hang of what item combinations are important or in which progression you should skill and build up your characters the game will surprise you with a great post-game experience in which you will fight new monsters, explore new dungeons for new items, new boss battles and more quests with hellish good rewards! If that is not enough, then you can try to beat the game on Hard or Speedrun Mode!\n\nIf you are someone that wants to 100% this game, then I highly recommend using the games wiki for. Simply searh for the wiki on google and you'll find it.","February 19","true","212.2"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","17","19","3","5"

The main issues, the framerate, the awful textures, and the strange aspect ratios are resolved. However the pop in that was awful in the console versions is still present, and I think is even more noticable since it clashes with the improvements. NPC's still take a little while to load, another annoying bug of the console versions.\n\nHowever, minor nitpicks aside, this makes what was already a tremendous game even better. Yeah you can't FLY INTO FREE, a change to the original Dark Arisen due to licensing issues, and you can't do Berserk OTP fanfic cosplay, again, to licensing issues, but that doesn't change the fact that this game is a must play. Give it a go, and if you're not sold by the time you get to Gran Soren then it might just not be for you.\n\nEdit: After more playing I've found a couple annoying gripes. For one Capcom didn't include the Eternal Ferrystone*, originally a gift for those that had played the original Dragon's Dogma before the Dark Arisen expansion. They still kept the price dirt cheap for Ferrystones at The Black Cat, but it's just annoying having to even worry about them in the first place. Secondly, it might just be a bug for me, but my visual settings reset whenever I exit the game, again just a minor gripe but it still shouldn't have to be bothered with.\n\n*You have to get your first Ferrystone and then the Eternal Ferrystone will appear in your inventory.","January 15","true","106.7"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","25","35","0","0"

Its dark, its gloomy, there is absolutely nothing good about the situation you're in. Having the constant need for a lantern just about everywhere you go helps drive this point home.\n\nThe gameplay feels like a dream. Like something that I had thought up as a kid, and hoped that one day it would become a thing. I mean, a sandbox rpg with bosses big enough that you can climb on? Shut up and take my money\n\nThe story seems lackluster on the surface, but deep down... holy ♥♥♥♥. I mean, name another game that found a way to make New Game+ canon. Do it, I dare you.\n\nThe difficulty is at that perfect level of not too hard, but not too easy.\n\nThe pawn system was genious. It broke my typical "I always run solo" mentality that I got from other sandbox rpgs, and boy does it feel good. Sure, theyre annoying when they never shut up. But hey, they have a mute button, so you lose no points from me.\n\nThe lack of an official fast travel system, while annoying at first, sometimes tedius, it redeems itself with the port crystal system. Not being able to instantly teleport back and forth gives me more chances to look at the world again. Hell, I still find things I didn't know were there every time I go out. Did you know theres a wakestone shard on the scar on Hillfigure Knoll? Neither did I, until I explored.\n\nThe equipment system is fantastic, and could have only been improved with a blacksmithing system. The Dragonforged system adds to this fact. I don't even want to know how many times I killed Timothy(The Drake south of the Shadow Fort, yeah I named him) to try and dragonforge all of my stuff.\n\nI could go on and on about how great this game is, but I'll leave it at this.\n\nDragons Dogma is my favourite game of all time, and if you have any interest in rpgs, play it.","May 9","true","81.3"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","17","21","4","0"

Several "fake" endings and post game epilogues are simply jaw dropping. Final final final boss and the way you deal with them is an amazing moment of videogame narrative.\n\nMusic is very atmospheric and battle themes get you hype every time.\n\nPhoto mode is a great thing to capture those cool moments when you are about to jump on a griffons back or stab a cyclops in the eye.\n\nNo JP voices and no Berserk gear is a bummer and awards -200 otaku points.

By the time you face drakes, dragons, hydras and such battles can become truly epic and last several minutes as you and your party struggle to keep up. Dungeons also litter the world and will provide you with fights and loot provided you can survive, most stuff respawns in a few days so you can grind exp or loot if you are so inclined.\n\nHaving several classes to choose from and switch at will promotes experimentation but some of them can feel a bit lackluster or too passive to be truly effective in fights that are often hectic and against multiple targets: there's also a certain lack of direction as, unless you read up on guides, it can take a bit to figure out what each class does and how it plays. You'll also have AI party members to help you but their usefulness can vary wildly...sometimes they'll be pretty good while other times they'll be happy to stand in front of an Hydra getting smashed down over and over: it can be frustrating.\n\nLast but not least the story is, well, dull, generic, uninteresting and backed up by cliched characters that act either stupidly or follow every stereotype in the genre: same goes for quests as most are your usual RPG fare or, for jobs, are kill or gather X of something.\n\nAll things considered though Dragon's Dogma can be very fun if you're a fan of action-RPGs , don't mind the story and are ok babysitting your party at times: there's lots to do and see (even though it can get a bit dull or repetitive at times) and it will surely keep you busy for a long time.\n\n","January 26","true","50.3"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","1"

Got pushed by the wind, trolled by the griffins, matured tons of steak, hired a bunch of sultry pawns etc etc. Then I started a new game because I wanted to create my character again. Yes, just regular RPG fan symptoms. This process repeated itself like a few days and I still had't even got to Gran Soren yet.\n\nThen somehow I finished my first playthrough in about 100 hours. Got pushed by the wind too much.\n\nHundred of hours more, and 4 years later...\n\nDragon's Dogma is finally on Sssteeeaaammm yeeeaaarrrghhh!\nSeriously, this game is overall better than even the likes of Dragon Age, Skyrim, Witcher etc. It is my most favorite RPG of all time alongside Dark Souls and Kingdoms of Amalur.\n\n+ Very nice graphics for a game developed in 2011. The texture details are not wonderful but the overall scenery is beautiful. The atmosphere of the game also gives the it a very unique feeling.\n+ Great music and sound.\n+ Nice variety of quite-balanced character classes. They feel very different from each other. Look at the scale of those spells from the Sorcerer! Feel like a boss with the Assassin! Tower defense mode with the Mystic Knight! And how are you not feeling satisfied by that earth-shaking slam by the Warrior's greatsword? Some may not fit your playstyle like others but they are all very nice overall.\n+ Awesome combat system and boss battles. I think the most popular opinion about this game's selling point is the interesting combat system. The regular hack-and-slash combat has a nice arcade feel with it, while the big monster fights do give you the sense of a real hard fight. Climbing on top of a Chimera and hack the goat off, shooting the Griffin off the sky, throwing a fire bolt at the Orge's knees to make it fall down, wrestling a Harpy down so your teammate can finish it off, bashing a wolf's head to stun it when it's charing in your direction, etc etc\n+ Monster varieties and designs are simple but very effective. RPGs nowadays tend to go for over-the-top designs that actually make the monsters look too cheesy. Look at the monsters in this game: dragon, griffin, ogre, chimera, cyclop, gargoyle, golem, hydra, harpy, lich, undead etc etc They look exactly like what you expected but still very impressive.\n+ Zombies at night! The game turns into a bit of a survival horror game at night which is very interesting. Your lantern runs out of oil, then you see those glowing eyes of the zombies in the dark... Muahahahah good luck!\n+ The pawn system is very nice, just don't mess up the inclinations.\n+ The fast travel problem has been dealt with, with the introduction of Eternal Ferrystones.\n\n- Quite boring NPCs overall.\n- Voice acting is lacking both quality and quantity.\n- Quests are a bit dull and sometimes the directions are not clear.\n- If you are not used to one-dimensional classes like the Warrior for example, you will find it very boring and repetitive compared to the likes of Assassin and Mystic Knight.\n- A few bugs here and there but let's give it time, patches and fixes will come.\n\nAll in all a very nice port. Hopefully we can get the Berserk armor back XD\nMoooaaarrr DLC please! Yes! Yes! Yes!\n\n"The wind is pushing me, into the clouds again\nI feel the blood in my veins\nTime is running free, I feel like letting go\nJust like the Dangur-aaangaaah!"\n\n9/10","January 15","true","5.7"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","13","15","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Auburok/recommended/367500/","Auburok","Auburok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Auburok/","581 products in account","I love Dragon's Dogma. It's one of my favorite games from the last console generation. It's something akin to Monster Hunter, but a little less... bizarre. Like Monster Hunter you create a person and play with them, but unlike Monster Hunter there's levels, classes, magic, skills and an assortment of quests to complete in a (mostly) open world. Going to split this into two parts: port report and game review.\n\nPort Report:\n\nOne of the best ports I've ever played, especially for a Japanese developer. 144 hertz support right out of the box, stable, runs well. I tried mouse and keyboard for a bit, but I played the game orginally with a controller and it still feels best for being a melee fighter. The game looks LOADS better than it did on the last generation and thankful isn't capped at 15 or 20 FPS or whatever it was last time. Some of the textures are a little muddy, but otherwise the game looks rather good for a last gen title.\n\nGame:\nDragon's Dogma is one of the coolest one-offs Capcom ever did. The story is rather decent (expecially once you get through multiple playthroughs for the "meta" aspect) for a fantasy game, and the gameplay top notch. You play as a person whom is felled by a dragon and forced into a pact - your fate is bound to this dragon after they take your heart, forcing you to figure out why you're still alive and what exactly you need to do.\n\nGameplay is something like a hack and slash with skills, gameplay varying a bit between melee, ranged and magic, with a few multi-class hybrids of those archtypes, and you fight monsters of all sizes with the aid of pawns, which are AI controlled companions. The game is not multiplayer, but you're able to hire the "pawns" or hirlings of other players or friends to help you battle these monsters, though you can also ignore them. The mounting mechanic that was in Monster Hunter 4 was probably inspired by the grappling mechanics in Dragon's Dogma; entities can interact with each other. A lot. Harpies can pick you up or your team, dropping them from above, you can jump on to ogres and gryphons and hold on for dear life, and you can hold down goblins and other smaller creatures so that your allies can get dirty blows in before releasing them. Warriors can launcher others into the air with their shields to attack things from above while mages blast things out of the air. It's rather spectacular gameplay, to say the least.\n\nThe animations are a little wonky for facial stuff, but it's not terrible and is more of a side effect to the amount of customization allowed in the game and was present in the original. That's the only "con" to the game I can think of aside from left over tidbits from the last console age, but for a port it's actually rather minimal (it's not like this is a remake). There's a ton of content in the base game, and I've never even played the Dark Arisen expansion. If you're into ARPGs, $30 on this game is a steal, and below is an instabuy.","January 16","true","67.7"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","14","18","2","0"

The AI, in my opinion, is top notch.\n\nThe Pawn system is brilliant. Your followers actually feel useful instead of just wandering around and occasionally hitting something. You can influence how your main pawn acts in and out of combat and how their speech is affected.\n\nClass system, really good. While looking a bit bland on the outside the game actually encourages you to try different vocations, aquiring numerous Augments (which are passive abilities) to add to your preffered class.\nAll the combat skills feel fluid and the power of the skill normally matches the animations. Nothing feels out of place.\n\nThe World itself is Huge, There are so so many places to go. There are no mounts, but there is a ferrystone (hearthstone) and there are portcrystals you can shove into the ground to make your own return points.\nNight = Pitch black, nuff said.\n\nA must have for anyone who loves the Elder scrolls, Zelda or Souls Games.\n\nSolid 9/10\n\nTis but a scratch!","May 22","true","62.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","1"

A brilliant level 20+ ulitarian/ medicant mageling who enchants your weapons, cooks your enemies, heals your papercuts and rubs your feet (though the last happens when offline.) Annaya, the mage for all your needs! I certainly won't regret you taking her!\n\n*ahem*\n\nThe game. I love this game for the following reasons:\n\n*Pawns: The pawnsystem I like a lot. Pawns are awesome. Compared to most games where you get conpanions/servants/ pets they are actually incredbly usefull as well. Where a companion in Skyrim mostly serves as eye-candy they really augment your main (and each other) here. Teamwork FTW.\n\n*The graphics help me immerse myself in the game, especially the day and night cycle (and the dawn and evening transition) really enhance the game's appeal for me. No sudden day or night for you sir/ lady.\n\n*Day and night cycle. I often stay out to late and aside from missing dinner I suddenly get tested to the hilt in areas I skipped through laughing during daylight. Where bandits and goblins hunt during the day I ran into undead and weird whispering mages in the night on the same spot.\nAnd how about the dead rising all around you because you just had to cross a graveyard at night? I loved it.\n\n*I like the way you can armor and arm your character, every part is represented layered armors are awesome. I wish more games had this.\n\n*Physics. Seeing a berserk flaming enraged ogre rush off a ledge and then getting a fat xp reward is pretty rewarding. Shame about the loot though. There also is a lot of interaction with the environment.\nClimbing on enemies is a really, really nice touch as well. I always wanted a Chimera mount and it's a pity they don't want me as rider!\n\n*ANNAYA (awesome pawn now for hire)\n\nThere are things I like a bit less as well ofcourse.\n\n*The game's combat mechanics need some getting used to and the starting buttons on the keyboard need a master of yoga to handle properly. Or someone with six+ fingers (per hand that is) perhaps.\n\n*Save a lot. You can die swiftly and since loot is random that may mean losing that awesome cloak you found just before. *sobs*\n\n*Quests have no difficulty indicator. Especially escort quests can be hard; having to pass a cyclops, chimera and dragon in that order to reach a durned fortress was a weeee bit much for my level 18 group. They can be a little vague as well at times.\n\n*Occasionally pawns can be derpy. Having a pawn rush ahead when you stand on a ledge and watching it fall isn't a good thing. Pawns picking each others bodies up when I am trying to get them back up and trying to dodge an ogre at the same time isn't good either. This never happened to Annaya ofcourse, it always happens to other pawns. Honest.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI love this game. It has its flaws but they are tiny compared to the good bits and its even better when you hire ANNAYA as pawn!","April 2","true","224.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","10","11","5","0"

You will have stories like this and many more if you decide to pick up this fantastic, under-appreciated action RPG.)\n\n\nIt’s been a day and a half since we left Gran Soren.\n\nAlthough my pawns were putting forth a brave face, I knew they were tired. I could feel it, too—though my daggers were still as sharp as ever, the arms that wielded them were sore from the constant conflict of the night. When night fell, we had been crossing the ridge into southern Gransys, and quickly found ourselves accosted on every side by bandits. We were prepared—many journeys along the road to Gran Soren from my hometown had taught Senna, my main pawn, the best way to deal with these rogues. She had taken a fancy to grabbing them from behind, leaving them open to a flurry of scarlet kisses from my blades.\n\nBut our destination still lay ahead of us, deep in goblin country. Larger, more powerful goblins infested these roads, yelling broken obscenities at us as we approached. They wore armor that made it difficult to assault them, but the mage pawn I had recruited worked out that they were weak to fire, enchanting our weapons with burning heat that cooked the goblins’ shriveled skin on impact.\n\nWe happened across a large pack of goblins at the foot of a tree. I sneaked forward and took out my bow, aiming upward. I fired a cloudburst of arrows into the sky, which came down like rain on the unsuspecting enemies. They scrambled about wildly, looking for the source, finally spotting me.\n\nIt immediately became apparent that there was something different about these goblins. A few of them rushed me, as I was expecting, but more still hung back, pulling out crude horns, blowing discordant notes into the air. Some sort of war horn? A call to battle? It mattered not the purpose—I instantly knew that these horns must be silenced.\n\nMy pawns sprung into action, engaging the goblins at melee, while I went to work as a sniper, pulling the bowstring as far back as it would go to inflict massive damage at range. One after another, they fell as my arrows find their marks.\n\nI felt the ground tremor under my feet. What was that? My eagle eyes scanned the horizon, looking for the source. It was only then that I noticed that a cyclops that was on the other side of the knoll had heard all the noise from the horns, and was coming to investigate. It stood at fifteen feet tall, and carried a club that was as tall as he was. Seeing us, it let out a cry and jumped a surprising distance, joining the fray.\n\nMy pawns noticed the new combatant immediately. Only one of us—the powerfully built female warrior pawn that reminded me of Senna—had ever fought a cyclops before. “Assault its eye!” she cried, charging into combat with her five-foot greatsword in tow.\n\nThe battle raged. The cyclops was a terrible foe, as it had gargantuan reach with its club and power to match. Being walloped with it was like being hit by a falling tree, but you had to pick yourself up quickly, or risk being stomped on.\n\nFor once in my life, I was frustrated with my daggers. Their blazing fast speed availed me naught against such a foe. However, by a stroke of luck, my mage pawn summoned a lightning bolt, which stunned the beast and brought it to its knees, leaving its eye vulnerable to my flashing steel. As it recovered and pulled itself to its feet, I began to hatch a daring scheme.\n\nI sprinted at it from behind, taking a flying leap and grabbing on tight. I scampered up its back as it flailed like the world’s most wrathful mountain. Once I reached its crown, I began to bury my blades in its eye over and over as the cyclops screamed in pain. Reveling in my cunning, I didn’t notice its wandering hands until they were upon me, pulling me off its head and holding me in its ever-tightening grip.\n\nThe warrior was the only one to realize the danger I was in. “’I shall scale its back and help the Arisen!” she cried. She grabbed on to its back as I had, and began climbing slowly, her giant claymore held in her free hand.\nI struggled to break free, praying my mage would use another lightning bolt to stun the beast so it would drop me. But, the bolt would not come. I strained my neck to see what she was doing, and noticed her incanting a spell. Was… was she healing me?\n\nThe warrior was halfway up the cyclops' back before it grew tired of my struggling. It pulled back its hands, and then clapped them together with all its strength, shattering every bone in my body and killing me instantly. But right before that, as I saw the palm rushing toward me, I had only one thought…\n\nWhat an idiot pawn. All they had to do was use Levin, but instead they tried to heal me?\nI know someone who’s going home with a Sour Scrag of Beast and a one-star rating.","January 16","true","124.0"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","13","17","5","1"

You can get items to change your appearance and start the adventure again once you beat it, but you're stuck with your stats forever. Equipment will really be what defines you in the late game and new game+, but having the ability the make stat changes without starting over would be nice.\n\n-Not much variation on landscapes and monster design. There are lots of monsters, but many are stronger reskins of things you've fought before with a new trick or two. Landscapes could also do with more variation. 60-70% of the time, you'll be wandering through a forest with pine trees. The rest you'll spend in caves, swamps, and ruins.\n\n\nThe great\n-Best character creator I've played with in a long time. Customize everything from your height to your voice! Want to be short, tall, skinny, or fat? Go right ahead! Want to make a dwarven giant-slayer or an kid-sized wizard? You can! Want to have Shrek adventure alongside Harry Potter? You can! It's so easy to use to. Simple menus and plenty of templates allow for easy use.\n\n-Play dress up. Armor and clothing are layred on top of each other and allow for some very unique outfits. Also, capes, lots of capes to flow majestically in the breeze.\n\n-Class-based warfare. Unlike most modern openworld RPG's, you class matters. Play a warrior and channel your inner Guts as you cut down entire packs of monsters with sweeping blows from gigantic weapons; or take up the mantle of the fleet-footed strider and scale gigantic foes to strike their weakpoints. Or just be a mage and hang back to heal your team and enchant their weapons.\n\n-It's dangerous to go alone! In the early game you'll die if you don't bring a few pawns to support you. Monsters often attack in huge packs and giant foes will bite your head off. You'll also need specific elements to attack specific foes. Magic is the only way to hurt ghosts and some foes need physical might to bring down.\n\n-Action packed battles! Climb up giant foes to punch them in the face! Put smaller monsters in a head-lock so another member of your team can punch them in the face! Unless you're charging up a spell or a skill, you're likely moving to attack or get out of the way of an attack. Even some ofthe biggest monsters will be constantly on the move, requiring you to keep up to be effective.\n\n-Lots of little machanics to keep you on your toes! Weight management is key, the heavier your load, the slower you move. Unlike other games where you only have two speeds, overburdened and not overburdened. Dark nights and darker caves will make carrying a lantern key to sucess. Make sure to carry empty flasks for any interesting liquids you want to take home, bring picks to mine, and be sure you've got airtight containers to preserve foods as they ferment to their restorative peeks. There are a bunch of little things to keep track of that other openworld RPG's would omit for the sake of mass appeal.\n\n-Big, open world. This game world is huge. You can explore just about anywhere you like, but chances are you'll get one-shot by monsters if your not careful, or if you stay out during the night. Night is dangerous too. The undead rise and ghosts and worse will prowl the lands.\n\n-Amazing boss fights. Tackle monsters of all size and shape in thrilling encounters. Flying beasts need to be knocked out the air and armored giants require powerful attacks to stagger. Also, the best Hyrda fights around.\n\n\n","May 25","true","45.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Even if the setting is utterly generic fantasy, the story is meaningless until the end and the map isn't actually as huge and varied in say, the Elder Scrolls games. The combat isn't like Dark Souls and yet it still works really well, there's a lot of physics-based fighting with knocking enemies down cliffs and grappling and climbing on top of huge monsters. I was thoroughly entertained all the way. Don't get this for the story, get this for tossing goblins.\n\nThe biggest unique twist is that you get to design your sidekick character who will be completely AI-controlled and who will learn from your actions. Even though this is a single player game, your sidekick will be uploaded for other players to hire and you can hire two more sidekicks in the same way, completing your 4-character squad. Your sidekick will earn gear and levels only while traveling with you, but it will learn quest knowledge, combat strategies and world navigation while traveling with other players. Mostly it will be repeating the same lines you've heard hundreds of times but eh, sometimes it mentions something useful and I like to travel with talkative minions. Don't expect any Bioware style character storylines though.\n\nAnother great idea is that there aren't any QTEs or "press X to be awesome" scripted moments in boss fights, they're very freeform and if you want to stab a huge monster in the eye with your sword, you need to manually grapple the beast and hang on and climb over to the head and hope you don't get shaken off. It makes the boss fights feel really awesome and clever, especially as there's plenty of tricky monsters where you need to figure out what the weak point is.\n\nThis PC version has all the DLC included, so once you get close to finishing the main story or start to get bored with the main world map, you can head out to the Bitterblack Isle expansion area. Instead of open outside areas, it's more like a sequence of dungeons, a bit Dark Souls inspired, with lots of randomized variants (and increased difficulty). It's a great expansion, while using the same lovely combat system as the main game the areas and enemies are quite different, so it feels almost like a different game. Plenty of optional stuff to repeat and grind to gain overpowered endgame items, if that's your thing.\n\nI had zero problems and zero crashes with this PC version port and it even runs smoothly on my older hardware so tech-wise too I think it's a damn fine job. I guess I should stop calling them "Crapcom" from now on.","April 11","true","106.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","2"

Dragon's Dogma is a game with a tremendous story, terrific gameplay, and one of the best experiences I've had playing a game. It was one of my top games for the PS3 and I'm so happy to see it come to the PC with enhanced graphics and framerate that make the game even more stunning compared to the PS3 version. I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys a third-person style RPG with real-time engaging combat. The Pawn system is a unique companion system that allows you to share your companion with other players to help aid them on their quest and help your companion learn to handle different scenarios. The class system in the game allows you to enjoy the game however you want whether it be archery, greatswords, magic, and more. Combat is intense and thrilling making it bound to bring up memorable moments. The story is incredible and so well put together it brought a tear to my eye!

Youll be fighting Goblins, wolves, ogres, cyclops' and some human enemies as well. Youll have the most fun with the bosses and in this case its a mix of Shadow of Colossus and Monster Hunter. You can climb bosses and stab them in the eye as they try to shake you away and weapons and armor are leveled up instead of using XP points. Your pawns can be both helpful and quite stupid at the same time. They mostly start to shout the same things at you and theyll get in the way alot, but when they are helpful, they throw helpful spells to strengthen your blows or hold enemies down while you deal the killing blow. There are so many class variations to choose from each with their own abilities, weapons and fighting styles that are very different. For example a Strider class can do a frontflip in the air and slam down hard effectively hurting the enemy, while a Fighter can rush in and push multiple enemies back with a single bash. Because of how different the fighting styles are, everyone is going to have a different experience playing.\n(+) Great Boss Battles\n(+) Great Level Up system\n(+) Loads of customization\n(+) Combat is addicting and satisfying bacause of how fast it is\n(-) Lack of Fast Travel\n(-) You sometimes have to fight the same enemies multiple times\n(-) Pawns can be dumb sometimes\nGraphics: The graphics arent amazing but they sure do beat the Xbox 360 versios. Theres no more horrible frame drops and alot of the textures and lighting effects have been revamped. Theres no cost to this as it runs very smooth 1080p 60fps and is a great Pc Port.\n\nIn the end you got a great action RPG that is cinematically exciting and not too much of a challenge. Its always addicting to find better gear to fight with and to find pawns that are usefull and that can turn the tide of a battle. The boss battles are amazing because of the almost unlimited freedom that you have in them and while this game isnt perfect its still one of Capcom's greatest achievements.\n\nBut seriously that love scene at the end was so awckward and out of place lol damn it Capcom!","January 25","true","37.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

At the core it is japanese through and through, it's first and foremost a game about mechanics - meaning it excels at combat and mastery of movement and well as grinding for equipment and building your arsenal is mandatory, but even when you are not having an understanding of the systems at work or what is going on, it stays accessible and kicking ♥♥♥ feels good.\n\nOnce understood that the fun of Dragon's Dogma comes from powerleveling and killing huge creatures and not a movie-like experience, you can truly start losing yourself in the game. If you are in it for varied characters, "epic" questlines, story or a vast and interesting world - you might as well think about skipping the game, all these elements are only here to support the mechanics. You don't fight for the next cutscene or bit of storyline, instead cutscenes and story prepare you for your next fight.\n\nWith that out of the way, I have to praise combat in Dragon's Dogma. Basically, this is what Witcher 3 SHOULD have been in my opinion. It's arcade-ish enough to bring that smile to your face when your massive Zweihänder connects or you annihilate mobs of enemies in a hail of arrows or using MASSIVE AOE-spells, but there is also plenty of builds and developing your characters with various classes to choose from that can branch off into different prestige-classes. It's all quite Dungeons & Dragons-esque (considering CAPCOM did some splendid D&D arcade games in the past, I can't help but wonder if some of the enemies in Dragon's Dogma are a nod to said games) and fun, because CAPCOM nails the whole "power fantasy" thing BUT at the same time doesn't totally make you feel like a god, keeping you in check with limited stamina and having a habit of killing you off easily if you are not careful. DD:DA certainly doesn't play itself and offers plenty of rewarding encounters to clash with even if you outleveled the mainstory-stuff.\n\nOne of the more interesting features of the game, the so-called pawn-system, didn't quite work out for me after playing Monster Hunter and Dark Souls online - playing with fellow Arisen's pawns (which are basically AI-controlled warriors that  join your party, emulating something that vaguely resembles Phantasy Star Online) isn't quite as fun as playing with real people instead.\n\nAnd to be honest, the original game of Dragon's Dogma isn't even all that interesting - world and quests are kinda dull, exceptions are Gregori and Mercedes - who I liked a lot, but the rest isn't much to write home about. Adding the fact that getting from A to B (especially in the beginning) is slow and boring, it's quite good that the game can be finished in less than an hour later on.\n\nHOWEVER, once you go to Bitterblack Isle and start the Dark Arisen-part of DD:DA, the game becomes brilliant. They crammed so much stuff in there - my favourite bit has to be that mightier foes are drawn to bloodshed and battle. You might be felling some foul beasts and when the floor starts running red with the blood of abominations, mighty dragons and even Death itself may show up. Surviving and understanding the Bitterblack-Dungeon was the most fun I had with Dragon's Dogma. It's high risk and high reward, really demanding an understanding of the core-mechanics of the game as well as having and extensive knowledge about it's items and character-skills. Hunting Death, farming cursed Bitterblack-Loot and upgrading my dragonforged equipment was amazing. At that point the game suddenly turns into a Dark Souls / Monster Hunter-hybrid and I ♥♥♥♥ing loved it!\n\nWhile the main game can be tedious and at times feel unrewarding, Dark Arisen makes up for that. If you enjoyed Dark Souls or Toukiden: Kiwami on PC or want something that is positively different from the big, western openworld-titles like Witcher 3, offering complex mechanics and much more substance in the gameplay-department you should check out Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. It's rough around the edges, but tries a lot of things and plays pretty much unlike anything we got on PC.\n\nPS: Armor-design is fantastic, in that late 80ies AD&D paintings kind of way. It's not quite Dark Souls-level, but pretty darn close.","January 30","true","62.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SonBroku/recommended/367500/","SonBroku","ShinroL~  (◡‿◡✿)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SonBroku/","127 products in account","TL;DR: The game plays basically like a fusion of Dragon Age, Shadow of the Colossus, and Dark Souls.  If that sounds fun to you, then you'll probably like this game.\n\nAs a somewhat tired and jaded gamer, it's become a rare treat when I play a game that really feels special.  Something crafted with a very specific idea in mind, something unique.  A labor of love, if you will. Dragon's Dogma is one of those games.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone.\n\nDragon's Dogma:Dark Arisen (DDDA) is often likened to Dark Souls (DaS).  When people say this, they aren't referring to its difficulty, because it's certainly not as tough as the palm-sweatingly punishing experiences we associate with those games.  What I think they mean is, very much like Dark Souls, Dragon's Dogma is a western-styled RPG made in Japan.  This creates a few unique aspects to the game.  quirky voice acting, and innovative gameplay among them.\n\nSee, when a western developer (or any really) makes an open-world RPG these days, there's basically a checklist laid out for them.  Its been done so many times that many devs play a sort of mad-libs with features and build the gameplay around a predefined concept or story.  It often feels like the gameplay is taking a backseat in priority to the narrative or world building. This is especially true in modern western-RPGs (WRPGS).  Many of them are going to have some sort of base stat system reminiscent of Dungeons and Dragons (str,agi,etc). They're going to most likely have some form of action based combat, unless we're talking about the wave of kickstarted Isometric CRPGs that have been making a resurgence.  Even then, they're mostly still based on DnD style systems with dice rolls, a morality/alignment system, and some sort of tree, or wheel based dialogue system.  My point is, many WRPGs share a set of common game design features, a standardization, of sorts.\n\nDragon's Dogma, like Dark Souls, pays almost no mind to those time-tested and trialed standards.  In the same way, it also doesn't adhere to the even more "strict" JRPG design guidelines.  There's no mandatory grinding, no random encounters, and no 30 minute cutscenes. It rides the same weird line Dark Souls does, between a JRPG, and a WRPG. Not quite fitting the mold of either. The gameplay feels fresh and novel, even if you feel like you've seen this type of game before.\n\nAt the heart of this novelty, are a few neat gameplay systems DDDA has implemented, many of which really make it stand out amongst the ridiculous amount of generic Tolkien-esque fantasy action-RPGs.  The chief among them being the Pawn system.  In short, the way the Pawn system works is as such:  You have 4 party members including yourself.  One of them, you create, and control the skills, leveling, and equipment of. The other 2 party members are made up of pawns you choose from a pool of other player's "main" pawns. Though they may seem it at first, pawns aren't just generic AI party members.  They are vocal, they learn, and will help, and guide you in more ways then just combat.  Your pawn is "lended" out to other players (while your character sleeps), and comes back bearing knowledge on whatever enemies, locations, or quests it encountered journeying with them.  Also, your world is populated by these pawns.  They walk around town, travel between towns on roads, and really just show up everywhere.  The game also features a full day/night cycle, with npcs having daily routines, and more monsters at night.  The world as a result, ends up feeling much more dynamic and, "alive."\n\nThe unique gameplay doesn't stop there though,  The stat system is not your typical DnD style system, instead actually sharing a lot in common with Dark Souls.  Like DaS, your equipment weight affects your character in a myriad of ways, unlike DaS, so does your inventory weight. Not only that, your character's height and proportions all affect the way it plays.  A short character will have the pros/cons that you would expect of that stature, as will a large bulky one.  This segues well into one of the more fun features of the game.\n\nIn most action RPGs, if you're fighting a big ol' dragon, you're probably whacking at its shins a bunch, or using some pre-scripted system to attack weakpoints.  In DDDA, you can grab onto, and climb basically any large enemy, and pick up and throw smaller ones, depending again, on your character's physical stature.  Smaller characters have an easier time with climbing, and are harder to shake off.  Larger characters reach farther with their attacks, can carry more weight, as well as grapple enemies, setting up a party assist.\n\nDragon's Dogma also has a unique class system known as "Vocations."  Rather then being stuck as 1 class the whole game, you're given the freedom to choose from 9 different vocations, and switch between them as you like.  You can even keep certain types of abilities cross-vocation, incentivising you to level multiple ones. The classes also affect how your stats grow, instead of picking stats as you level up.  A Warrior for example, will grow melee related stats, and a Mage will grow magic related ones, however a Mystic Knight will grow both.  Each class focuses on a specific weapon type and playstyle. With enough diversity and synergy to encourage you to switch it up.\n\nLike Dark Souls, Dragon's Dogma features a somewhat clumsily delivered story. However, it's not nearly as cryptic as in DaS.  The dialogue takes the form of a silent protagonist, with mostly linear conversations, with few choices at key moments, much like many JRPGs.  Overall I'd say the story and world-building are where DDDA shows its Japanese roots. There might be quests you miss because you didn't explore well enough, for example.  It won't hold your hand and warn you that you're about to screw something up, forcing you to actually immerse yourself.\n\nReally, if I had to sum up Dragon's Dogma in 1 word, I'd say "Freedom."  Freedom to play how you want, hell, you can literally romance almost every single NPC in the entire game.  Yes even the minor 1 line-of-dialogue, ones. Albiet, romance basically consists of throwing gifts at someone till they grow a pink aura around their head.\n\nOverall, I'd say that Dragon's Dogma is a great game for almost any fan of action-RPGs, as long as you can deal with a bit of clunky dialogue.  If you liked what Dark Souls was all about, but couldn't get into it due to its difficulty, this game is also great for you. Difficulty settings and NG+ allow for challenge, as well.\n\nArbitrary Numeric Scores Based on Arbitrary Catagories:\n\nGraphics - 7/10\n\nNothing amazing, the game is 4 years old at the time of this review, and for a 2012 game, I would call the visuals "adequate."  The lighting is very pretty with dynamic lights and shadows, and the characters and equipment look good.  Lower-res textures, and somewhat dated looking terrain building are to be expected, however.\n\nGameplay - 9.5/10\n\nNot much needs to be said here being that my review mostly focused on this part, being DDDA's strongest aspect.  Fun, engaging, and reasonably challenging gameplay, that allows you plenty of freedom to keep it fresh.\n\nStory - 7/10\n\nWhile I personally love the story and find it quite deep and emotional, I recognize it's somewhat clumsily delivered, with many threads to pull and questions left unanswered, at least, not without doing some digging.\n\nSound - 6.5/10\n\nThe game's music is, for the most part, your standard fantasy affair. Ambient noise is convincing, and sound effects are satisfying. The voice acting, in english at least, is pretty questionable at times, sadly.\n\nOverall - 8.5/10\n\nDragon's Dogma is all about freedom, replayability, and most importantly, fun. When it comes down to it, climbing a Cyclops' back and stabbing it in the eye never gets old.","February 1","true","226.2"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","0"

Some areas are gated by the main quest, but there's a lot to explore, and exploration is usually rewarded.\n\nGoodish Graphics: Decent character customization. The character models and textures could really have been a bit more detailed. The customization UI is okay; not as many options as I'd have liked, and it's far easier to create a hideous character than a beautiful one. The gear is much better quality. The world is well designed and interesting; again, textures could have been higher quality but this was a console game.\n\nProgression: Lots of gear. You're always on the lookout for upgrades, and these are reasonably well distributed across levels. I hear that at some point you sort of outlevel the gear grind itself, and can dress more how you like. Levels and vocation ranks are quick, and skills are distributed well.\n\nClasses: Major class archetypes are covered, with the exception of "healer" (more on that later). You can change your vocation (class) at any time, and this is encouraged. Gear is often restricted to certain vocations, but usually in a way that makes sense.\n\nEnemies: Monsters are well-done, and climbing on them is pretty cool once you get the hang of it. Enemies are varied and interesting. Nothing ground-breaking.\n\nPawns (Companions): Pawns are great, mostly. I got attached to my main companion pretty quickly. You can use other people's pawns and they can use yours. I actually worry about how my pawn was treated on their adventure.\nNot So Good Stuff    Lowish Replayability: The level cap is 200. I was 50 when I finished the main story, after a lot of exploring and screwing around. After the main story, there's 'post-game' mode to farm for gear, and then 'new-game+' to do it all over again. I was appalled to find that NG+ does not significantly scale in difficulty. So I'm level 50, decked out in nice gear, and back to doing noob quests and mowing through level 2 goblins and wolves. It's cool for about 10 minutes to be that powerful, then the boredom sets in. There's a much harder area (Bitterblack Isle) for veteran challenges, but prepare to spend the remainder of your time in that one zone. That's 150 more levels in a single dungeon ginding for gear and no new content to use it on.\n\nPC Port Quality: It's a passable PC port, but there are a lot of annoyances using a mouse and keyboard. For instance, the mouse scroll wheel doesn't work on any scrollable text; you to click and drag the tiny scrollbar. There's a thousand other UI conveniences M/KB users take for granted that didn't cross over, and it gets frustrating over time. Character movement, scripted fight camera gimmicks, etc. can be quite clunky.\n\nPawns: I wish I had more control over pawns in general. They can add a lot to a party, but can also be pretty stupid. You can always get rid of ones you don't like, and you can inspect them before hiring, but there's bound to be issues with a completely AI-driven character. They point out quest objectives, and shortcuts, which is useful. But otherwise they gibber constantly, screaming the same lines over and over and over. The attempt to make them more realistic with their commentary ultimately just highlights how artificial they are.\n\nPlaying the Class You Want to Play: There's debate over how much you need to min/max in order to end up with an effective character. If you lean toward perfection, be aware that the vocation you want to play may be the one you spend the least time playing. I wanted to be a Mystic Knight. Reading theory crafting, it turns out I'd want to spend dozens of levels as a fighter, then dozens more as a strider, then a hundred or so as a mage or sorcerer, and finally, at 150 or so, I'd play a MK. This seems absurd to me, so I specced MK as soon as I could and have been playing it almost exclusively. I'm told that when I get to Bitterblack I'll be in for a rude awakening, but it is what it is. I want to play a MK, not every class except that until the very end.\n\nSupport Roles: I love pure support roles, both playing them and having them in my party. This isn't really effective in DDDA. The Mage is the only class that can heal, and there is exactly one heal spell (and it's not that great). With a couple other spells, you could create a support pawn (many people do) but eventually they'll just be a liability. Damage is king, and a Sorcerer does this far better than a mage. So if you love healing and support, you'll be disappointed that this isn't really a viable long-term profession for you or your pawn.\n\nSave System: One save slot, plus a 'checkpoint' slot. You have only so much control over your saves. Example: you save manually, then enter an area and fall through the ground, getting stuck falling forever. Reload your save and you'll find that the game overwrote it with an auto-save upon entering that area. So now your only option is the checkpoint save, which was the last time you rested or entered a rift. This could be hours or days ago. This system also means you can only have one character. Altoholics be warned.\nOverall I've had a good time, and it was absolutely worth the money. I'm not sure how long I'll be able to maintain interest now that I've begun NG+. I don't feel compelled to do the same tutorial and noob quests over again. Everything is too easy. Bitterblack will likely be a challenge, but I'm hesitant to commit to it, because I know it will be one last long grind for gear that won't have a point once I get it.\n\nI'd recommend the game, definitely. You may get more mileage from it than I have, and even if not, it's been worth the time and price.","April 9","true","138.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The combat is great, the story is decent, though not noteworthy, and the AI actually isn't half bad. Granted, it's not great, but in a cinch, a well-trained and equipped pawn can dig you out of trouble. The soundtrack is wonderful (I recommended buying it, if you have the extra cash) and the voice acting is pretty cool.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/feuerzeuge/recommended/367500/","feuerzeuge","fleur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/feuerzeuge/","211 products in account","Dragon's Dogma is definitive proof that a game can amount to much, much more than the sum of its parts. Graphically, it's stunningly mediocre, but it manages to be amazingly good-looking at times, especially in dark dungeons and night scenes where your lantern is the only source of illumination. The art direction too is pretty solid in a Japanese ARPG sort of way, managing to make up for the technical limitations. The environments, polygonal and bare though they may be, can be surprisingly pretty at times, too, making up for the lack of precise details by invoking a grand sense of scale and possibility.\n\nAltogether, the presentation does what it's supposed to: it doesn't hinder anything - big monsters are suitably imposing, the animations are suitably smooth and non-distracting, and it evokes the scale and character of the fantasy world you're exploring. This game doesn't really have a story so much as a bunch of Berserk references strung together against the backdrop of an American straight-to-VHS medieval fantasy film world. (That also being the sequence of words I'd use to describe the general art direction.)\n\nPeople talk in a cheesy old-timey way, your pawns constantly dispense helpful advice, and everyone just sorts of mills around all day in a duchy with seemingly only two small cities. You'd think all of these things would be immersion-breaking, but the fact that the game plays itself completely straight works massively in its favour. I really can't help but admire Dragon's Dogma's boundless sincerity - helped further that it doesn't force you to sit through endless exposition or attempt to infuse its story with artificial drama or cheap attempts at emotional manipulation. It knows what it is and it doesn't make excuses for it or try to be cute about it. I have endless respect for that.\n\nInstead, the story is parceled out in easily digestible bits, just enough to give you a taste so you can make up your own mind about whether you want to chase the rest of it down yourself. And, more than that, by the end of it all, everything sort of clicks together and what appears at first to be unadulterated schlock instead turns out to be an alloyed core of interesting writing under a heavy coat of schlock-flavoured paint. Marvelous! Plus, the villain of this game is fantastic.\n\nWhat of the gameplay, then? The important part, or so they say. Well, there's 9 classes and all of them seem to play fairly differently. I've only spent a lot of time in about three of them, but fighting monsters, casting spells and moving around the field feels intuitively simple and can get quite satisfying. In all of the parts of the main game that I've played, there really weren't any heart-pounding skin-of-your-teeth struggles to the death that you might get out of something like Dark Souls, but it's not afraid to throw a little whupass your way when the situation calls for it, and consequently when you get stronger, you can really feel it in the gameplay. It's also just fun to do things in general, whether clinging to monsters as they thrash and jump and spasm and you get the odd stab in, or calling down fiery meteors on little packs of goblins with your wizard powers. And, speaking of character progression, there's really not that much of it in the way of traditional RPG advancement - you don't allocate stat points or anything of the sort - you just level up, buying skills as they become available, while progression outside of that is mostly based on gear.\n\nThat said, what this game does wonderfully is evoking a sense of child-like wonderment. The dumpy-looking NPCs have just enough agency to them that there's a bit of human-like inscrutability to them, like there might be something guiding their decisions that we're not privy too. More than that, this is a game where for once I was actually curious to see what lies behind every corner and unturned stone of the game world. If you go on a long trek with limited resources, you can get boned, forced to limp away through the night to the tune of wolf's howls. Unexpected things happen, and the whole thing feels like a grand adventure. As you keep pressing forward, it always seems like something worthwhile awaits, whether new stories, new monsters to fight, new clothes for dress-up, new weapons to kill monsters with, or something else that isn't a copy-pasted cave full of draugr.\n\nI got Dragon's Dogma expecting a fun little romp to distract me from my perpetual existential despair, but instead I got something that could very well be one of my favourite video games of all time. And I learned a lot about wolves.","January 25","true","87.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

" Gonna be a heartless person that murders everything that moves but eventually may go and get it  back"\nDragon's Dogma is on PC at long last!!! While port was fine on my side, I'm yet to get used to the whole UI in console games(too many clicks and menus for my liking). Still its something that I trully enjoyed.. to a degree.\n\nStory\n\nWell I didnt find much of a story in the game. It's more like some goals to reach while you are there. Dragon steals your heart and tells you to find him if you want to know the truth and thats about it(unless you decide to trully finish the game and start NG+ then there is a bit more story). Writing isnt interesting and most of characters I met felt bland/generic/cliche and hardly leave any mark on you after you have done talking with them. The game tries to give you choice for the ending but in reality there is only 1 canon ending, if you pick the other path you will be faced with Retry screen. But still, who plays Dragon's Dogma for the story,right?\n\nClasses/Vocation\n\nVocation= Classes in DDDA just to clarify. So what classes you got in DDDA? Well the starting one are Fighter(tank).Strider and Mage(support). Advanced - Warrior(twohander DPS),Ranger and Sorcerer(DPS), Hybrids - Assassin, Mystic Knight and Magic Archer. Each one of those got different playstyle and role. Though I only bothered to play Strider/Ranger because I like using bows in fantasy games in general.\nYou can change classes from the innkeeper(but first you need to buy them) with ease. Each class got 9 ranks that unlock skills and augments and you can use augments between the classes which makes it worthwhile to spend sometime maxing your classes before you tackle the harder content in the game(Dark Arisen DLC).\nWorth noting that when you level up you get stats depending on your current class(lvl1-100 gives higher stats per lvl, than 101-200). On the other hand mobs dont seem to scale with your level(even in NG+ I think the mobs got the stats from previous game which I find kinda cool) so its expected to have really hard time at the start and later on to find the whole world a piece of cake.\n\nMap and running\n\nMap may look big at first glance mainly duo to the stamina usage because you can either run(slow/fast depending on your inventory weight) or sprint and with the latter you need to use stamina(which you use also on skills) so you may want at the start to take it slowly until you learn where what spawns(which pisses me off a lot, spawns spot stay the same, only the mob maybe different depending if its post-Game or pre-game(game aka killed The Dragon or not).\nWorth noting that some spawns respawn really quickly( in my first fight with a drake the goblins respawned during the in-game night ... damned party poopers) . Oh yeah, there is day/night cycle which offer different challenges and resources to find if you dare.\nNow in PC release once you reach the capital(Gran Soren) you are given Eternal Ferrystone that allows you to teleport from portcrystal to portcrystal though at the start you will have only 2 available: the one near the fishing village and the capital. Later on you can buy/find portcrystals through out the world and place them wherever you want which is helpful if you dont want to keep running left and right or dont want to bother with escorts(since NPC rarely talk during escort and also seems to obtain the desire to be punched by a cyclops). Still there are some interesting places to be found(most of them are quest locations so its worth doing all side quests).\n\nCombat\n\nCombat is the standard action-adventure style that runs the show really well. You have slashes, archering and spells. While melee and range(bow) aint nothing special, the spells are just mindblowing even after you see them for a 1000th time. Often people complain that some weapons dont seem to have any weight(aka either do a lot of dmg while animation is weak or the other way around) so DDDA decides to give a facemelting power to the spells with a cost ofc, a cost that may cost you dearly .... long spell casting. So while you cast that sweet sweet meteor shower on your enemies you may get interrupted by a random mob which will make you run away and start casting again but once you cast the spell, you may just go have a break and then gather the loot. In my first fight with chimera I spent good time trying to kill it when my pawn decided to just destroy the chimera with 2 direct hits from meteors(good times) .\n\nUSP(Unique Selling Points)\nFor me this game offers 2 USPs - the well made boss fights and Pawn system so lets talk about them.\n\nBoss Fights\n\nWhile boss fights later in the game can feel like a chore, the first impression is great. Every boss got weakspots and being strong/weak to certain elements so while playing you may want to experiment a little to learn those weaknesses and exploit them in combat.\nAlso lets not forget the really unique part of the boss fights : climbing on the bosses. This can be priceless at times, especially against bigger monsters where you are climbing your way to their weak spot and then start stabbing them while they are trying to get rid of you like the little bug you are to them.\n\nPawns\n\nNow thats something that can make the game hilarious or bothersome depending on the AI. So what are pawns? Pawns is companion that is given to you because you are an Arisen. You can customize your pawn the same way you customized your character. You can give them class and equipment, teach them skills and so on. And by teaching skilsl I dont mean only set their skills but also their behaviour. You see, pawns will often mimic your skills once you perform them long enough in front of them. Sadly I never managed to teach my pawn much apart from 2 things : being 100%  Link(aka break everything breakable) and jumping away from boss attacks(which is hilarious once and the other pawns learn it) . So its worth it to pick the class of your vocation and try to teach your pawn how to reach in different situations.\nYou can also hire up to 2 more pawns created by other players. Its important what level pawns you hire - hire higher level and will cost you Rift Crystals(currency that you receive from drops,quests and as reward from people hiring your pawn) or cost you nothing if you are friends with the owner. On the other hand if you hire lower level then you will gain more experience which is good if you want to level up fast.\nPawns can learn from each other and share experience between them + if you are a new player, pawns can give you good insights about different encounters and quests instead of googling it.\n\nOverall\nIts a game that I truly enjoyed even though it didnt offer the RPG depth I prefer(aka in questing and decision making) but that doesnt stop the game to be something worth playing if you want well made boss encounters.","January 23","true","120.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/superemp/recommended/367500/","superemp","EmP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/superemp/","360 products in account","Dogma is a large game spread over a sizable map that is quite insistent you explore fully. Though the Dark Arisen update makes exploration easier by providing collectible portals you can strategically place around the map to use as quick travel points, it really prefers that you go everywhere on foot. Such journeys are often long and fraught with danger, relying on Dogma’s night/day cycle to mix up the threats. Pedestrian worries like bandits and roving goblin gangs threaten travelers during the day, while the undead are more likely to be found seizing the night. Initial exploration into unknown territory is often an adventure in itself, with long forgotten camps or razed strongholds to sometimes stumble across and explore. Or you can just wait for a quest to come along and force you in that direction. There’s always some excuse to head west, but moments when you find something new are exhilarating. Discoveries bleed into one another, daring you to risk pushing a little further into the unknown.\n\nFifty-hour me had outgrown all of that, though. Fifty-hour me had explored the entirety of the map, had stormed hobgoblin strongholds and used the mounted ballista situated atop cliff faces to peg explosive bolts at the small army waiting to ambush him. He had chased off a magically resurrected cockatrice, and only got half his traveling party petrified in the process. He had tracked a gargoyle down to its hidden lair high in the mountains because the bloody thing had stolen someone's post!. He sat on the edge of game completion. There were just a couple of missions left to go. It was time to venture to Bitterblack Isle.\n\nFull Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12921/pc/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen/review.html","April 24","true","88.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

Honestly there isn't much choice for this genre outside the Souls games. However this game was directed by Hideaki Itsuno who also directed the Devil May Cry series so this game's combat and mechanics are hands down second to none. The combat is better than any souls game and the variety in play styles will keep you entertained for dozens of hours. The combat is also very challenging and Hard Mode is only recommended for veteran players, you WILL be one shot by large monsters even with decent gear. You've been warned.\n\nThe only thing that keeps this game from me is the game's story presentation. This game is all about the action and lacks polish in that department. It's not bad at all, but comparatively it could be much better. But that doesn't mean this game lacks in content, with Bitter Black Isle and the main game content you can easily spend over 100 hours before seeing everything. This game was made on a budget and considering what they did with how much money they had it is insanely impressive. If Dragon's Dogma had even close to the budget that Skyrim had then this game would be heralded as the best game of all time by nearly anyone. Such a shame.","May 31","true","25.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

One of my favorites alongside Skyrim etc. What makes this game different is the use of pawns (companions) much like paper and pencil D&D. In fact this game very much reminds me of Dungeons & Dragons more than other game out there. It has a very strong influence from that game and the developers also mentioned Fighting Fantasy gamebooks having inspired the artwork. It has a very medeival combined with dark fantasy feel to it.\n\nThe game features many addictive qualities like building your character and pawn, replayabilty, sharing pawns amongst fiends, exploration, romance options with NPC's, dungeon delving, dragons, classic D&D monsters and a very immersive world due to the fact that fast travel being slighlty restricted when compared to other games. Combat is one of the best features in this game and is hands down the best (and funnest) in the genre. Once learned, it can almost compared to action games such as Devil May Cry with combos, thrusts, dodges and take downs. Climbing huge beasts also almost never gets old.\n\nIt's got flaws which prevent this from becoming a mainstream hit (expecially amongst review sites) but those flaws and the great features I mention above combine to make one of the most cult classic games of a generation.\n\nThis port is a fantastic job, the graphics are smooth (I'm running an older GTX 580) and many improvements have been made.\n\nD&D fans, this is a must own. Casual RPG players.... take your time, stick to it, get better at the game and you will be rewarded with a  hidden gem of an RPG.","January 17","true","134.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

A lot to be sure, i never had a PS3 or Xbox 360, so when it first came out, i couldn't play it so the PC port alone earns praises from me, specially due to how well it was ported, higher fps, higher resolution, KB+M controls that aren't downright terrible(in fact, they have their own advantages in the hotkey function) and very well optimized running in many kinds of PCs.\n\nAs for the game itself, it starts slowwwww, the game tells you where to go regarding your main quests, but thats it, no hand holding on anything else, and i LOVE it, in an open world game YOU should be the one discovering, YOU should be the one learning about what to do, the NPCs shouldn't all magically tell you the what-do of the place and the best part, when you discover what to do, theres no guarantee you can actually do it, because this game's enemies don't scale with you, they have a fixed strength, which will make you notice your own growth even more as you go from puny fisherman to Dragonslayer demigod.\n\nMy main praises for this game go towards the combat, as many people would say as well, hack n' slash will most likely only get you killed and you need to properly learn what to do against each  of the stronger monsters, each of the vocations feels and plays great, but sadly due to how stat growth is done, you can't really have all vocations in one character unless you go the balanced route and that is my only problem with this jewel, 1 savegame and no way to reroll your stats(not a legit way at least), which leaves  a bad taste, i leveled as warrior/assassin, which means i can play the physical classes just fine, but sometimes i get the itch to play magick knight/archer/sorcerer and i am quickly reminded of how low my magic attack is.\n\nNo game is complete without a soundtrack and in this one's case, its magnificent, the combat soundtrack just adds to the epic feeling you get when fighting big monsters, gets you going when the theme changes after you meet certain requirements and basically says "STRIKE NOW!" to you with the change, the DLC also has quite an amazing soundtrack by itself, albeit not as big as the base game, for obvious reasons.\n\nEnding this i'd like to specially thank capcom for doing a pre-order bonus the right way, they could have locked DLC behind pre-order, but they didn't, instead they gave us all the DLC with the game(including the ones you'd normally need the original dragon's dogma for) AND as pre-order bonuses they gave us the incredible soundtrack and a 313 page digital version of their artbook which is also amazing.\n\nScore\nGraphics - 8/10\nGameplay - 9/10\nSoundtrack - 8/10\nFun - 10/10\n\nI'd personally recommend this game to Bethesda, maybe they would learn how to make actually epic dragon fights this way.\n\n","January 20","true","77.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

For more detailed review, look below.\n\n\n\nDragon's Dogma is one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nFrom the music to the pawns this game is fantastic and is still fantastic from the time that i spent playing it on the 360. I will be going into more details about the game as this review goes on but for now allow me to tell you a tiny summery of the games story. I will try to avoid spoilers.\n\nThe Beginning of a Legend. -A Short Summery-\nYou are Arisen. Born in a small fishing village on the coast, you think your life will be simple and care free until one day it all changes. A dragon attacks the village and takes your heart and says to you, if you want it back you must face him. Now it is your destiny to fight the dragon and take back what was yours. Through grit, determination and the help of those known as the Pawns, you will take the fight to the denizens of the land. From goblins to drakes, your mettle will be tested and your skills put to the test.\n\nThe Music of Dragon's Dogma. -A Review-\nThe music in this game is wonderful. Plain and simple. From a calming melody as you walk the land in search for adventure to epic orchestral pieces for boss fights that will have you on the edge of your seat, the music has a answer for every occasion and all the thanks goes to Tadayoshi Makino, Rei Kondoh and Inon Zur!\n\nHere is some other work these great artist have done!\nMr. Makino: http://vgmdb.net/artist/7165\nMr. Kondoh: http://vgmdb.net/artist/13\nMr. Zur: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0958735/\n\nFrom Swords to Staves. -A gameplay review-\nThe gameplay in Dragon's Dogma is great but it does have its quirks as well. In the beginning of the game you start off as either a Fighter, a Mage or a Strider. Each one has its own unique style and as you use that class more you will unlock abilities for each "Vocation" and later on you can even upgrade to a different Vocation.\nThe Fighter use a sword and shield and are great for soaking up damage due to the use of the shield and their abilities are based around both around offense and defense. Great for the player that wants to have a good balance of power and defense.\nThe Strider is the Vocation that uses a short-bow and two daggers. Their abilities are based around a nice balance of close range support and long range damage dealing. This class is great for ranged combat but can also dish out high damage at close range. This vocation is great for players that wish to dish out high DPS and hit a enemy where it hurts.\nThe Mage is a magick based vocation focusing on support via healing, buffs and enchanting your party's weapons with a multitude of elements buy using a magic staff. Not only can they support you those ways but they can also bring the pain via magick attacks in multiple forms including a LIGHTING WHIP! This vocation is great for ranged combat but for up close combat you could do better. A great vocation for players that wish to be more support focused but want to be able to do damage as well.\nThe game also includes a upgrade system for your gear which at times can become a grind fest. See, the way the system works is you will need money AND materials from monsters, mines, plants, people. While it is good to be able to upgrade that sword you like, spending time and money on walking back and forth from place to place does get a bit tedious. But you could always see these times as a way to level up, explore for better places to find materials and bond with your Pawns.\nThe AI can also be questionable at times but is far from incompetent. Just from times to time you will see your party members acting odd.\n\nYour Best Friend and Ally. -A Pawn Review-\nWhat is a Pawn you ask? Well, in the lore they are those that walk beyond the Rift. They know not age nor death and are servants to the Arisen.\nBut, in a gameplay sense, they are your second. They will carry things if you want them to and will even fight alongside you. They do this the same way you do by having Vocations. They also start out as Fighters, Striders and Mages and level up their vocations the same way you do. But they are far more than just mere walking, talking, killing saddle bags. Your Pawn as well as others like him/her will learn. They will learn from enemies as they fight alongside you as you fight them. They will be able to tell you weaknesses and strengths and even how you can get to a certain place or how to finish a quest. They even say themselves, "My kind is better able to serve the more we learn."\nThey even have their own personalities. You want a wise cracking Pawn? Go ahead! What about one that is afraid to fight but will to protect others? Sure! The one bad thing I can say about pawns is that their AI can be questionable but it is far from incompetent. They also seem to repeat themselves quite a bit but in my honest opinion, gives them a bit of charm as you can think of it as their catchphrase.\n\nA Story for Eternity. -A Story Review-\nThis section will be a bit shorter than the others due to the summery at the top of this review plus I wish to avoid spoilers.\nThe story in Dragon's Dogma is okay but where it really picks up is at the end. While the story isn't fantastic, I do find it charming and really fun! The ending in my honest opinion is fantastic and opens up an entire new realm of possibilities. In my honest opinion, people should play the story. While it does feel like it is a bit lacking it makes up for it in the end.\n\nA End to All Things. -A Final Thought-\nDo I think you should pick up Dragon's Dogma? Yes, absolutely. It is an amazing game even with its faults and should be played. I have made some of my best friends from this game and have so many wonderful memories and hopefully, you will make some as well!\n\nMy Thanks. -A Thank You-\nHello! Thank you for reading my review of Dragon's Dogma! I hope you enjoyed reading it and provided you with some information before buying the game. If you have any questions, comments or thoughts, please let me know and I will try to respond to you!

The game also supports 4K resolution\nThe music is very Japanese rock, and very much adds a heroic atmosphere to a battle\nGood variety of quest and mission types, especially Ambush quests where larger than average creatures such as a Chimeras appear\nA great variety of armours, weapons, and clothes to make you feel like an Arisen\nThe combat system, particuarly the Magick system is something I haven't seen much in RPGs. I love the sheer amount of spells and how each spell behaves (the animations are over-the-top incredible).\n9 vocations to choose from: [basic] Fighter, Strider and Mage; [advanced] Warrior, Ranger and Sorcerer; [hybrid] Mystic Knight, Assassin, Magick Archer\nYou can have up to 2 pawns, excluding your main one. Usually you are shown pawns your own level, though you can search for higher level ones. Bear in mind, higher level pawns will cost rift crystals.The work around is if you are friends with the pawn's Arisen, you can hire the pawn for free!\nLittle details such as: needing a lantern to see if you travel during the night; creating heavily muscular characters can jump higher and carry more weight, something which hasn't been done much in RPGs; smaller build characters can fit into tighter spaces and move faster.\nA simple and easy to understand UI\nCons:  Graphics and particular cut scenes can look outdated, though there are several mods available on Nexus Mods to improve this. ENB is a popular one at the moment: http://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/searchresults/?\nVoice acting isn't the best, and can take away from the moment\nThere isn't much in the way of a fast travelling system. You can find a handful of portcrystals in the game, and can place them anywhere, apart from caves or the likes. Having said this and taking into account the size of the map, this can be a negative if you don't like walking great distances. The positive is once you enter New Game+, you can buy portcrystals in Gran Soren for 200,000G\nThe story can be a little lackluster/not impact your emotions much\nConclusion: I had an absolute blast with Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen on the PS3, and with its near flawless transition onto the PC, this is a recommended game if you like a decent RPG with great music! For £23.99, it's a steal for the amount of hours you can sink into it.\n\n\nRelated games:  Dark Souls series\nElder Scrolls series\nDragon Age series","January 17","true","100.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The game also only officially supports 16:9 aspect ratios. (1920x1080, 2560x1440, etc.) You can check google for a list of 16:9 aspect ratios. Please read the FAQ on the discussion before buying.\n\nDragons Dogma does not officially support any mods, but Capcom has stated they will not suppress any sort of modding of the game. So, perhaps we may see some fan-made mods, regardless of how small.\n\nIf you enjoy games like Dragon Age or The Witcher, you'll enjoy Dragon's Dogma. The story is fantastic and features a unique combat system that will provide you with hours of entertainment.","January 15","true","4.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/robertpatrick/recommended/367500/","robertpatrick","eisiger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/robertpatrick/","273 products in account","It's a satisfying game filled with subtle (and sometimes annoying) game mechanics, on top of a lengthy single-player campaign filled with lots of hidden quests and not-so-hidden fetch board quests, which by the end of it will turn absurdly imbalanced in you and your party's favor. I would put a bunch of similar playing games right here, but almost every game anyone has ever compared it to is almost always wrong. It has mechanics similar to those games, but the amount that each aspect has spread out over the game makes it impossible to compare fairly. It's Shadow of the Monster Hunter: Skyrim, basically. You can argue that the combat has no "weight" to it, but the amount of stupid ♥♥♥♥ you can get away with doing because of it is extremely satisfying. This, along with a majority of the soundtrack (the only track I cannot stand is the generic overworld combat music--replace immediately), makes for some of the best moments I've ever experienced in a long time.\n\nIf you're not into intense grinding for the absolute best character/partner gear well after the main game is finished, this game might not be for you. You can explore and experiment the game over again without losing your charcter progress in New Game Plus and beyond, but will eventually discover all of the hidden side quests and special events. Beyond that, the interactivity mainly lies in creating your dream "Pawn" for other players to hire, who will pay you in rotten food and Riftbux to further enhance your pawn pimping.\n\nIf you're still reading reviews, wait for a sale because you're obviously still interested in it but can't justify the $30 for a three year old port. If you've played this game before but got burnt on the original release's pacing and frame-rate issues, you'll probably buy this game a third time, because they've fixed that issue and then some (I love the useless pawn chatter, but hey, disabling it's a feature now). For everyone else, just give CAPCOM your money; daddy needs a sequel.","January 31","true","73.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

I never played the Dark Arisen version though so I decided to buy the game again for the WinPC. I haven't regretted it 20 hours in. I'll write the review for those that have never played the game.\n\nThe good...\n\nPresentation is good with a classic RPG feel even with a title track with classic RPG vocals. I'm playing the game on a Surface Pro 3 (SP3) and it runs well even at 720p with a mix between medium and low settings. To get a better framerate even in the 40 - 50FPS range on SP3, go with 800x600 (oh noes! lol) but turn settings up or down as desired. The game still looks good at that resolution and it allows for a better framerate with good quality even at full screen.\n\nThe combat starts off slow obviously because you're weak in the beginning. But once you start learning skills and your pawns gain experience fighting more powerful enemies, the combat is some of the best I've ever experienced.  Truly epic. It's like a faster paced, easier to get into Monster Hunter inspired system. The ability to climb enemies is well presented here and adds a extra layer of strategy to the gameplay. Using craft plays a big roll too. For instance, throwing a flask of oil onto an enemies and then using blast arrows to light nim on fire. There are options in how to tackle a battle.\n\nThe world seems limited at first with specific distinctive paths. But there is a lot to explore with quite a few instances of traveling too far away from town finding yourself lost in the dark of night with all manner of enemies creeping in the shadows. The game does a great job with day and night cycles. Bring a lantern because night time is pitch black in the dead of night. The flora and fauna, the wild life, the hills and valleys...Dragon's Dogma does a lot to convey a living breathing environment. It's not uncommon to go exploring in the countryside only to have a Chimera run up on you. Or to be ambushed by a pack of Direwolves or even fall prey to a Wraith. But the exploration is satisfying because you'll find all kinds of things tucked away among rock formations, under bridges, among trees, far out in the countryside. This is a world that deserves a sequel just for the exploration aspects alone.\n\nEnemies are the classic RPG variety. Cyclops, Chimera, Griffins, Drakes, Dragons, Goblins, Saurons, thieves, bandits, zombies, mysterious robed figures that want you dead...etc. The AI isn't perfect for them but overall, the enemies are a geniune threat. Death comes swift for the careless. The animations are generally good and breaking off monster appendages is always satisfying.\n\nCharacter creation is detailed allowing for a lot of depth in customizing your character and your pawn.\n\nThe main quest seems typical at first. Meany Dragon attacks, hero is weak but sets out to slay the meany Dragon. But it's not that simple with a great plot twist at the end that inspires at least another playthrough. The Red Dragon isn't even THE dragon in the game. The Ur Dragon is the one to see. Good luck with defeating him though lol.\n\nWeapon and armor customizations and upgrades are generally well done. There is some grinding but it's nowhere near as bad as Monster Hunter.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThe environments can be vast with a lot of detail but there are some texture glitches I've seen and spotty draw in for various objects in the environment. Some enemies and trees will suddenly appear, Hills will shift slightly as the 3D engine gets sorted when you enter the environment.\n\nEnemy AI can sometimes go from being incredibly stupid to incredibly intelligent in a heartbeat. One moment the Chimera, as an example, will walk into a wall and walk in place for a few seconds and then suddenly do a series of attacks that will decimate your party if you're not careful. Bandits and thieves will walk around without attacking even though you're hitting them, then suddenly, they will attack in force with archers hidden in the distance and melee fighter dealing precision hits.\n\nLoad times can be a bit slow at times\n\nSome of the animations for the NPC can be comically weird.\n\nThere's no way to actually make camp when out in the wilds in the dead of night.\n\nThe game could have used one more town or another major city. Gran Soren is as good as it gets even though to be fair there are forts about as well as some castles and then there's the tower.\n\nOverall Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen is a great action RPG game that goes a long way to give the feeling that you're in a living world that's tethering on the brink. Seeing so many NPCs and other warriors (as Pawns) out and about helps flesh out the environment too. I highly recommend the game for action RPG fans that like exploration, epic battles and watching your characters turn into monster destroying gods.","January 21","true","65.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Had it on ps3 as well and can confirm it´s much better on pc framerate and visuals at least. The game it self is the same and what a game! Playing as sorcerer is my favorite, you can get so powerful, yet the game punish you anyway. I kind of destroid it this time, strait to bitter black island and farmed the best stuff before I reached lv 50... Now the rest of the original game will probebly be breeze. You could almost say the Bitter black island is the best part anyway, epic bosses, epic loot and crazy fun over end over again. I referd to dark souls in the begining of this...review i guess i can call it. Dark solus is and will always be my number one game, this game even though it´s nothing like dark souls in the way it´s mechanics woks gives me that feeling, you know when when you finaly cleard that boss or got passed that area, it´s challanging and it manged to throw in a bit of skirim world exploring, without the boring fights you get in skyrim. This is the best way i can describe Dragons dogma, it´s not the biggest game (area) it´s not Dark souls or Skirim, it´s Dragons dogma and a hell of a addictive, fun and challanging game you can spend countless hours with.","April 8","true","54.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game is a hidden gem of fantasy games, if you were even thinking about checking this game out, stop looking at the reviews and get it asap, it's THAT good!\n\n"But Barrel, what do you even do in it," Well for starters you are a person in the game living a normal life in a small seaside village not giving a damn. Suddenly a dragon appears and starts to murder all of your friends and family. You being the idiot you are grab a nearby guards sword and rush in to stop the beast, unfortunately you're a weakling and he crushes you and steals your heart. Then you wake up and find your heart missing and you suddenly are alive and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that you have no heart, and that starts your journey.\n\n"But how does it play?" AMAZINGLY, honestly! people draw a lot of comparisons to dark souls for whatever reason (I think it's the expansion area I never touched yet) but with all honesty to me it feels a lot like the first fable game's kind of combat with MASSIVE improvements. You play as one of 9 classes 6 of which are normal and advanced, and three of which are combination classes. Obviously you explore the land essentially playing what is a single-player 4 player co-op game by yourself (this is also where the comparison to dark souls comes from,) How that works is you have a thing called a pawn, a companion you create and mold yourself who follows you and learns from everything you and it do through the whole journey. Along with that pawn you are allowed to summon in two pawns from other players worlds to assist with the ♥♥♥ kicking you will surely deliver, they too will learn (and steal your ♥♥♥♥) which they will then bring back to their owner once their job is done (they die, or get expelled by you.) It's a really interesting system because you can spend rift points to get a higher level pawn who may have knowledge on weakness of a certain enemy or info on a quest you're stuck on, really unique.\n\n"Barrel you never talked about actual gameplay there" Well I had to explain the pawn system somehow. But anyways combat is nice and sweet, each class plays VERY differently (for nine classes that adds a lot of replayability.) But in general combat is like a beat em up, you got general light attack, heavy attack, but with each weapon or hand you have you can assign three skills (out of about 16 usually per weapon) which include stingers, launchers, aoe's and enchantments to name a few. The one thing that will strike you is combat is MEATY and FUN, it's not mash a until they die it's get in his face! slash him a few times! Maybe pick him up! then any of these options is allowable A) throw him to the ground for a stun B) hold him down so your pawns can beat his face in easily C) throw him off a cliff or ledge to his death, or my personal favorite D) toss him in the general direction of your strongest warrior and watch as they home run his stupid ♥♥♥ to oblivion!\n\nThe main thing people talk about however, is the boss fights! they are the most spectacular part of this game and the main reason I ask you to give it a shot. The bosses are your typical fantasy monsters, but they are MASSIVE in comparison to you, most often holding a weakpoint in a very specific area or an obvious high up area, You might be wondering "why play anything that doesn't have a bow then?" the answer is climbing. Every class (except warrior) has the ability to hop on, grab a boss, climb all over it, and attack it from wherever you need to. this results in boss battles being very tense as you climb around these titans hoping they don't move their arm just enough to knock you off, it's a massive risk to jump on a chimera as it rampages through a forest, but it is IMMENSELY satisfying to stab it enough times to knock it down so your whole party can immediately gang up on it to do massive damage.\n\nAll this is happening while the amazing soundtrack is playing in the background, seriously glad I preordered because I got it for free but holy is it ever good. from the calm opera that plays when sunrise hits (ala loz) to the hypest war dums and guitar that kick in when you find a group of enemies in the wild. the soundtrack hits at the perfect timing every.Time. the fear inducing sound of the griffons song playing as it crashes into the open field you're walking across, or the theme that plays as you gain the upper hand of a beast by toppling it. the soundtrack is absolutely wonderful and will stick with you for days after you're done playing.\n\n"But Barrel how does it fare as a pc port" Well I mean compared to the original it's wondeful, compared to other pc ports it's just plain average. If you're looking for a game that'll push the limit of your brand new rig you might want to look elsewhere. Textures you can't complain about (not too stellar or amazing), framerate stays at sixty for roughly 99.5% of the game (I only noticed one instance of it ever dropping for a second or two.) overall a very solid port that does exactly what you want it too without pushing your rig to it's literal extreme.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is an amazing sleeper hit back in 2012 when it first released on ps3 and xbox 360, And I am VERY happy I got the chance to play this gem now. It is a brilliantly made game that is well worth every dollar you can give it.","January 23","true","50.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

You control your character and your main pawn.  Your main pawn can get used by other players including your friends on Steam.  In addition to your main pawn you have 2 sub pawns that round you out to a party of 4.  It follows the traditional rpg elements in that you want a tank, healer and damage dealer.\n\nThe game is a port of a game that came out some years back on the PS3/360 and includes its DLC.\n\nStory/Progression: I wasn't really worrying too much about this for most of the game.  The main story is pretty short and very simple.  There are a lot of quests, some of them are good and developed and others are just typical RPG fetch quests.  You and your pawn level up at the same rate whereas your other hired 2 pawns don't level up with you, they level up in their own games (whoever created them).\n\nGameplay: It's a 3rd person game and you can start the game as a ranged fighter (strider) with bow/arrow, a melee tank or a mage.  There are some expanded classes as well.  The combat is a lot of fun and offers different ways to approach fights.  See that troll?  You can climb on him, attack him, climb up to his head and stab his eye.  The gameplay is a lot of fun once you get the hang of it which doesn't take too long.  The different classes offer a range of skills and let you use some cross skills as well.\n\nGraphics/Audio: (Running an i5 with 780 graphics card and on board audio). Game ran really smooth but the graphics haven't aged greatly mostly because they weren't that great to begin with I think.  Overall for what it is, they're fine.\n\nOverall: I had a lot of fun with this.  This game above all else does one thing better than a lot of games out there.  New Game +.  When you start NG+ you have everything from the first game, you're leveled up and you have all your awesome weapons so now you can go wreck stuff.  This is how I like NG+ to function.  If you want a challenge there is a Hard Mode and a Speed Run mode as well built INTO the game!  Would love to see more games do this.","March 5","true","42.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Naturally griffons can fly so it took off with me on its back, all was well until I lose my grip and begin what would certainly have been a fatal fall, only to be caught by my companion just before hitting the ground.

The keyboard and mouse do not feel out of place..... Looking at you Dark Souls.....\n\nI recommend Dragon's Dogma: DA to anyone looking to play something a little different, but a little like DSouls+Shadow of the Colossus, than take out Souls PvP.\n\nPros++\n++Runs great for a port.

You'll need to do some reading and really put in the effort if you want a good Pawn. Think of Pawns as Companions, but they learn and adapt.

I didn't mind the ending, the rest feels like a wast of time.\n--Graphics.. yeah it's a older game, but they are even dated for a 2012 game\n--In order to start a new game, make a new character, you have to delete your old save. Yes you can find ways to work around it, but this should of been changed a long time ago. Long before the PC version came out. This does hurt DDA reply a lot in my opinion.\n--Going back to the story here, it's very short if you push it and yes you can find 100s of hours of gameplay still. Just don't think you'll find even half of that time in the story.\n--You won't find a great deal of different enemies.\n--Voice acting, yikes..\n--It will make you want to try Dragon Dogma Online.

DD ran like absolute ♥♥♥♥ on consoles. It chugged to keep the framerate steady even in a normal situation and if anything cool happened, it quickly became a slideshow. An awful showing for Capcom's MT Framework engine, whose perfect performance mythos became a meme for so many people who understood nothing about it.\n\nThe PC version? Smooth as butter. I can't make this game chug no matter how hard I try. Dragon's Dogma finally plays like it should.\n\nDragon's Dogma is a game of contradictions. It's about the times where you are battling goblins in a field only for a griffin to swoop in unexpectedly and surprise you with a boss fight, but also about the times where you are fighting goblins in a field and nothing cool happens so you walk to the next field and fight some more goblins. It's about a hero slaying a dragon and saving a colorful fantasy kingdom and at the same time it is about none of those things. It's an open world adventure and then a closed copy-paste room arena fighter. Then it thinks it's Demons Souls for a while or something.\n\nYou have not played anything like Dragon's Dogma. What DD does, nobody else comes close to. Your character, and a party of three other AI controlled characters, picked from a half dozen swords and sorcery classes, go out and wail on monsters. No, no, bear with me. This isn't some Diablo-esque clickfest or Souls-style somersaulting knight-fighter. Everything feels visceral and just right. Powerful sword swings, flurries of arrows, wizards causing giant ice spikes to slam up from the ground, the rogue climbing the monster and just stabbing like a madman at the softest spot he can find on the creature... The combat here is up there with some of Capcom's most satisfying stuff. This isn't just an RPG where you are swinging at health bars, it's a bona fide action game. Every single monster in the game gets just as much care. They all have a lot of character, are instantly recognizable, and are satisfying to fight.\n\nThe problem is, almost everything else DD does isn't even as close to as good as the core combat. The world-craft and writing are charming, with shrewd merchants, crafty plotters, busybody nobles, a secret cult, dragons, knights, the church, a mysterious witch in the woods... the theme is spot on and yet... everything comes out kinda rushed. Quests aren't highlighted at all, and you are only going to find half of the story important side quests on a normal run, if that, without a guide. Which is fine enough because almost nothing you do has any real impact by the time the ending rolls around, which I shall not spoil but to say it is almost the video game equivalent of your DM suddenly having a fit of CREATIVITY during your D&D campaign and ruining everything.\n\nThe world does not reward exploration (Which is another contradiction. In the original DD release, fast travel was not only extremely limited but quite expensive. You were expected to want to explore the world on foot. Dark Arisen's rerelease loosened the restrictions a little.). Chests and loot are everywhere, but you better be excited to find yet another flower that can craft with another flower on the opposite end of the map to make an alright healing potion that you just found in a chest anyway. Oh boy, another 30 second magic defense buff hooray.\n\nWorse still, the leveling system is a huge part of the game, so before long you'll be leveling massive cyclops monsters in three hits, removing all the fun you used to have in those fights. High end play is almost completely busted as the class variety just sort of fades out to each class's most damaging engine. Crank it over and over and the game's toughest bosses are a joke.\n\nNowhere is this more obvious than Bitterblack Isle. BBI is the post-game content added into the Dark Arisen rerelease of DD, and since it is technically add-on content, the game keeps trying to tell you it's there despite every one of us playing on PC being way underleveled for anything on offer. Don't take that bait. Come back in NG+ after beating the story.\n\nWhere Dragon's Dogma reveled in the fantasy theme with a bustling medieval town and a grand overworld, BBI is just one dreary dungeon (Laughably, about half of the areas in this dungeon are copy paste and there aren't more than 15 zones total in the dungeon from entrance to exit.) filled with frightfully overleveled monsters, trying to catch on to the Demon Souls craze. Even some Souls-style "just make another completely out of place knight and call it another enemy." stuff arrives. A full on loot-grind slot machine system shows up here and here alone, and since this gear will be better than anything in the main story, it really does feel like a separate, uglier game.\n\nDD's combat is fun and visceral, but there's not a lot of room for skillful play. So when BBI attempts to crank up the difficulty, the monsters spam instakill attacks (By this point you have so many extra life items, Capcom must be treating it as a joke.) and other such cheese and in response you just fire your class's designated overpowered move (or moves if you're a Mystic Knight.) and shred some life bars. At this point, outside of BBI's surprisingly fun bosses, the game has completely degenerated. The swashbuckling fun of the early game is gone, it's a simple, straightforward engine versus engine with occasional trips to the loot slot machine.\n\nBut despite all that, the parts of DD that work truly are incredible. Nobody as even attempted swords and sorcery combat like what Capcom has here. It's absolutely worth digging in, so long as you are willing to cut the game some slack for its silly parts.","February 3","true","123.7"," 53 of 100 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","53","100","5","23"

In this game, you will spend the entire game with a party of 4, although you can only control your main character. Thankfully, the followers are fairly clever and enjoyable.\n\nThe combat is fun, definitely an improvement in comparison to games such as Skyrim and Kingdoms of Amalur. Boss battles feel epic - bosses have unique weaknesses, you can climb up onto the wings of a dragon and hold on as it tries to shake you off.\n\nThe class system is simple enough yet has enough different abilities for it to stay interesting for multiple playthroughs.\n\nTook me about 25 hours to complete the game for the first time on the Normal difficulty, and I immediately went back and made a new character to play it through on Hard. Haven't completed the expansion area yet and I gather that will gain me some more hours. If you enjoy the game enough, I'd say at least 50 hours is guaranteed here.\n\nCons? The game only supports 1 save file at a time, though with some PC magic and mods it is easy enough to have multiple save files. The game isn't really as "open world" as it might say, you spend most of the game following the main quests with some side quests and tasks to do on the side. I don't feel like there was a problem with this, but if you are looking for a true open world game this isn't quite the one.\n\nAdditionally this game has some end game grinding for those who want to obtain the absolute best gear, but this is completely optional and exists for the grind-obsessed folk out there so don't feel like you have to do this!\n\nOverall I rate the game a solid 8/10, it was enjoyable for many hours and a recommended pickup for any RPG fan","March 16","true","56.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

What a gem of a game.\n\nComing from a long line of experience in playing RPG games, Dragon's Dogma has been filling a need I have felt for awhile.\n\nI love turn-based RPG games, but many times I want a game like Skyrim with all of its Action RPG elements. I thought Dragons Age - Inquistition would be the "go to" ARPG for awhile for me.. but something about it was missing.\n\nDragon's Dogma nailed it perfectly and showed me exactly what was missing; a game that is gritty, dangerous, surprising and suspenseful - right down to being ambushed by everything from Wolf packs to bandits.\n\nOutside of it's questing, one thing that is fun about Dragon's Dogma is it's Rogue-Like elements. You can start a new character, do the starting quest, and then just strike out and explore as you please. Sometimes I treat it as a Rogue like game, explore, level, get gear and just have fun.\n\nWhile the "No Rails" approach (outside of the starting questing from around level 1 to 10) is surely the greatest fun to me, you can and will get in over your head more than once, so be warned about this. You most likely will run into something that will give you a severe beating. Save and save often is the motto.\n\nI love the Huge monsters you can come across while exploring. Nothing builds excitement like seeing a Huge, Towering Ogre, that is weilding a Cudgel the size of a large Oak trunk, that has a pack of Goblins about him.\nIt is fun to listen to your pawns banter while you are trying to decide, "Can we take him?"\n\nThe Pawn system is a blast, and I love that ascpect of the game.\nYou get to custom make your own. Outside of that, you can pick up one or two other Pawns that other players have made, to join you on your quest.\nWhen someone picks mine, it is always exciting to see how they liked my Pawn.\nIt is a personal pride to for my pawn to come back with a prize, 4 or 5 star rating, with a compliment.\nLikewise, I enjoy finding a well made pawn and sending back a decent prize (not a rock as I often get, even when complimented).\n\nIf you have been on the fence about Dragon's Dogma, read up on Pawn Inclinations, as that is a huge thing in the game and will be very important to your experience.\n\nAlso I have learned, don't hesitate to try different Vocations out.\n\nThe only thing I wish this game supported, was more than one character save at a time. Unfortunately, if you want to try a different character/pawn combo, you have to start over as it erases your former save.","April 3","true","131.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

(Equipment/Appearance/Skills etc.).\n+ Instead of training your whole group, you can simply replace pawns to improve your group.\n\n- Pawns derp alot. ("I have to carry that downed pawn to the arisen, while the dragon that incapicated said pawn is attacking me")\n- Many players create rather useless pawns.\n- While it is nice to have companions that comment every situation, it very quickly get ♥♥♥♥ING ANNOYING TO HEAR THE SAME LINE AGAIN FOR A HUNDRED TIMES. YES I KNOW THAT WOLFS HUNT IN PACKS AND THAT EVEN IN NUMBERS, A WEAKLING IS A WEAKLING STILL!!!.\n\n\n\nCombat:\n\n+ The combat-system is extremly well done.\n+ You can climb on big enemies to attack weakspots (like discs on golems). Just dont climb on flying enemies.... srsly dont.\n+ 9  different  playable classes.\n+ Each class has its cons and pros aswell as a complete different playstyle.\n+ The "boss"-fights in this game are just great.\n+ A hard-mode that actually makes the game difficult.\n+ A quite entertaining speedrun-mode....\n\n- Some classes are less powerful than others (iam looking at you magick archer)\n- Creating certain character builds requieres you to level a different class.\n- Ever seen a pawn use the "Necromancy"-spell? Theres a reason for it: Certain spells/skills are weaker than others and thus not a viable choice.\n- 6 different elements with amazing different effects.... Why is this a bad thing you ask? Everything but the "Holy"-element is useless. Especially the "Dark"-Element.....\n- At one point the game turns into a boring grindfest.\n\n\nStory:\n\n+ Great story. (my opinion)\n+ Multiple endings (ok. some are just bad ends with reloads)\n+  The (true) ending was wonderful and depressing alike\n+ Theres a romance-system....\n\n- .... that is poorly triggered....\nIt is the last person (with the highest affection stat) you spoke with.... my RO apparently was freaking Caxton\n- Dumb side quests (Why would you want me to go kill sea-birds WHILE THERES A ♥♥♥♥ING DRAGON TERRORISING THE WORLD?!?!?)\n- The story (which is still great) has more clichees than most horror movies nowadays....\n\nOther facts:\n\n+ You can easily switch your class in the tavern.\n+ All dlc´s included\n+ Day and Night-Cycle has an impact on the world (f.e. undead rising in the night)\n+ The "Dark Arisen"-DLC adds a complete new area with real difficult enemies.\n+ The game actually takes note of the gender, the height or the weight of your character(s)....\n\n= I dont care about graphics...... but lets make a small exception for 1 thing in DD:DA :\n+ THE MAGIC SPELLS!!!!! OMFG, IVE NEVER SEEN SUCH GREAT SPELLS!! MAELSTROM IS A FREAKING EYECANDY....\n- and yet there are some problems with said visuals f.e. a holy enchantment on a bow actually blocks your view and lowers the visibility.\n\n- Only 1 savegame.... just 1.\n- Seems to have some (typical) port-problems on the PC.

I was on the lookout for a decent Fantasy Action RPG after being bowled over by Skyrim, and this seems to fulfill my demands to a certain extent. I expected a huge open world with lots of enemies to kill and quests to complete. This game does indeed have a huge open world and also an array of quests to complete, but not in the way you expect.\n\nOn comparison to Skyrim, the world is lifeless. The NPC's are generic and don't have any personality whatsoever that distinguishes them from the others. The ones you get quests from are like interactive notice boards since they don't give you any other information which would give you their backstory (Though some of them tend to express their miseries at times). The quests also feel monotonous after a few hours because they are either escort quests or kill X amount of enemies.\n\nIn terms of graphical fidelity, this game is heavily outdated. Textures feel washed out and the animation doesn't ameliorate the woes either, since the developers really did a terrible job on the character lip sync.\n\nHowever, even after all these problems, I love this game and feel that I've got my money's worth. Reason being, addictive gameplay and an impressive soundtrack to boot. The gameplay shields the game from being a boring, repetitive mess as the combat is unique and will keep you glued during the entirety of the game. I would however like to point out that the difficulty curve tends to be steep at points as the game throws difficult bosses at you (Especially during escort quests when the NPC is usually suicidal and likes to get near the monster to be killed at an instant). However after reaching a certain level, this problem ceases to exist. The pawn system is quite enjoyable despite the Pawn AI being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and over-talkative most of the times (Thank god there is a setting to shut them up). The soundtrack keeps the world feel alive even though there are long walks where you find no actual life.\n\nI would certainly recommend a buy if you're looking for an Action RPG that doesn't end soon. Well worth the asking price.","May 25","true","28.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I first played Dragon's Dogma on xbox360, so while I don't have a lot of hours on the pc version, I have quite a lot of experience with the game in general. I can't really comment on the quality of the pc port because my pc is crap and can't handle it on lowest settings (like i said. crap pc) but from what I've heard from people with functioning gaming pcs, the quality is great.\n\nDragon's Dogma is one of my favorite games, in one of my favorite genres. It has its faults, and it took me a while to really get into it, but I think it's pros definitely outway its cons. So here's an in-depth view at different aspects of the game, with a summary at the end.\n\nStory\nAt first glance the story of DD seems really basic: you're the chosen one on a quest to kill the dragon. Progress through the story and past the 'ending' though, and you find a rich and deep story. Alternate endings open for you to explore (before being taking back to the 'true' path) completely change how you view aspects of the story, further adding to it. DD also manages to incorporate common video game features such as NG+ and ai companions (refered to as 'pawns' in DD) not just into the main plot, but into its best parts. They have their own rich lore and role in the plot, and while I can't really describe what makes the story so different without spoiling large portions of the game, to me it was 100% worth the time I put into it. While there are times when the game seems to be mostly 'filler' quests that don't really add to anything, they're well worth getting through to the parts where the story is amazing. When Dragon's Dogma gets its story right, it gets it really really right. When it's lacking a bit, the other aspects of the game more than make it up for it, especially the combat.\n\nLore\nI'm putting lore seperate from story here because of one very specific reason. While the lore surrounding the main plot of Dragon's Dogma is really really fleshed out (and part of why the story is so great) everything else is really only hinted at. You know your country has neighbors and there's complex political stuff going on, but the game doesn't give you anything beyond that. If it's not relevant to the main plot, you don't hear much about it. Whether that's good or bad really depends on how much you care about lore. On the plus side, no lore hidden in books and codex entries you end up spending 40 hours reading (looking at you bioware).\n\nCombat\nMy favorite aspect of DD would have to be the combat system.\n\nShort version: I love it so much that I don't mind going on fetch quests as long as there's combat.\n\nLong version: It's much more fluid and I feel much more involved than I do in other 3rd person fantasy rpgs. Enemies don't scale with you and there is no auto heal so the beginning of the game is fairly difficult- accessing certain plot important areas can be difficult to nearly impossible without the proper practice and class set up. As you progress the game certain enemies become easier and easier, while new, stronger enemies take their place to keep the game interesting. Each enemy has specific tactics you need to defeat it. Some, like wolves, are easy. Others can only be harmed by specific elemental damage or in specific places on their body- and you need to figure that out (with a bit of help from your pawns). You can climb enemies and target any spot on their body. If you're fighting a cyclops- take out the eye. A large monster is holding a club- attack the hand. More difficult enemies require more detailed and well thought out strategies, keeping you on your toes the whole time.\nEach of the different classes is unique and interesting, and can be switched between at any time (which in turn can be used to strategically for leveling up specfic stats). You start with three classes (called vocations), but soon get access to not only advanced classes (which are not necessarily better, e.g. only basic mages can heal, the advanced sorcerer cannot), as well as hybrid classes available only to you and not your pawns.\nNo scaling enemies, no auto-heal (and other healing limitations), and difficult fights make the game a real challenge, especially at first, but never unfairly so. The more you play the better you get, and not just because you begin to match the enemies level wise. As I learned when I started a new level 1 game on pc after playing to much higher levels on 360, the combat gets easier because you get better at it, and things that used to seem tough and challenging before are completely possible now. And honestly that feeling is a damn good one.\n\nThe Pawn System\nThe pawn system is one of the things that makes Dragon's Dogma so unique. It's tied in with the story and allows some aspect of connectivity to other players; you can recruit two additional pawns to your own for a 4-person party. Because you have hundreds of pawns to choose from, you end up being able to customize your party any way you need. Keep dying? Hire a stronger pawn. Stuck on a quest? Hire a pawn with knowledge of it. Same goes for foes and areas- pawns learn new information and tactics related to each of these, which they share with you ("tis weak to fire" "wolves hunt in packs" get used to those two phrases) and implement themselves. While your main pawn never actually leaves you, when they 'return' from being with another player, they keep any quest, location, or foe knowledge, as well as any items they recieved. Basically, other players help make your pawn more effective, benefiting you. They get to use your pawn, benefiting them.\n\nCharacter Creater\nDD has one of the best character creators I've ever used, hands down. You can customize anything from your arms to your legs to your posture, and much of it entirely gender neutral. You can create the shortest, skinniest, oldest hero with incredibly long arms and a tiny torso, or the tallest, largest, must muscular person you can imagine with tiny tiny legs. Oh and you get to do it twice: once for yourself and once for your main pawn. The amount of choices you have in the CC is kind of insane.\n\nGraphics\nI can't speak much for the pc port here, but I always loved how the xbox360 version looked. There are prettier games, yes, but Dragon's Dogma's graphics match its mood and atmosphere, and imo are not at all bad. The pc version got a graphics boost as well as an increased frame rate so if graphics are an important factor for you, this is the best version for you. Even on the lowest graphics (remember that crap pc I have?) the game still somehow manages to look beautiful to me, especially the lighting, which changes throughout the day.\n\nSounds and Music\nThere are some songs from the soundtrack I really love, my favorite being the music that plays as big enemies/ boss enemies get closer to dying. It never fails to get me ready to win that fight, and the music that plays right as the enemy dies is the most satisfying sound in the world. I search out strong enemies just to hear this song play as I defeat them. 100% worth it. The rest of the music and the sounds are good too.\n\nSummary:\nStory- when its good its really good, when its mediocre there's other stuff to make up for it. Would 100% recommend for the parts where its amazing.\nCombat- my absolute favorite. super in depth, lots of cool stuff.\nPawn System- one of the things that makes this game so unique. Ties normal video game mechanics into the main plot.\nCharacter Creater- super in depth, one of the best of any game.\nGraphics- match the atmosphere and mood of the game, and imo are really pretty in their own way.\nSounds and Music- also amazing.\n\nTLDR: I love this game and everything about it, and I don't mind any of its flaws one bit.","May 30","true","15.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I could go on about plenty of neat touches of reality in the game for an entire review, but I won't, because besides that, Dragon's Dogma has some truly visceral, genuinely fun combat, with plenty of customisation, strategy and freedom with how to tackle opponents.\nThe story is pretty boring despite an interesting overarching theme and a prolonged ending sequence that will knock you flat on your ♥♥♥♥, but Dragon's Dogma has some solid gameplay and dungeon-crawling to sink time into, especially if you're a fan of Dark Souls, Monster Hunter, and/or Elder Scrolls.","January 19","true","76.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Expectedly, coming as it does from an action game developer, its jewels are to be found in the dynamic combat, stat-tweaking party-building and defining boss battles. In this way, the game echoes the adventurous, dragon-hunting spirit of its (second- and third-hand) literary influences: that sense of unpredictable peril that could be lurking in every cave and thicket.","January 21","true","45.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Then hurl him up though the air and flip around and send a volley of arrows up into the sky to fall in a group of other targets.The movement animations are spot on and smooth while doing all of this.\nOh baby the RPG Gods are good indeed. It will take some careful key mapping to accomplish this but when you get it sorted out you will be in heaven.\n\nUpdate #2: Now i am about 30 hours into this game and it has to be said that this game features the best combat of most RPG's I have played.\n\nIt just captures the thrill of battle a bit better than other RPG's. This game was a PS3 game released in 2012 and now ported to the PC it's better than most of what the current PC games have to offer. For all that the newest Fallout 4 has to offer it does not come close to touching this game in the thrill of combat.\n\nDragons Dogma has got better combat than any MMO too. It's just so much fun running into a mob of enemies and thrashing the lot of them.\n\nThe story ... who cares. It's fun to follow the story but the real fun part is the combat and I just can't get enough.","January 15","true","39.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

This review is also not a review about the technicalities of it as a pc port.\n\nAfter sinking 40 hours into it, I simply adore it. I see its faults and I know where it falls short, but I still want to play it. Despite having to run EVERYWHERE (unless you start throwing portcrystals like seagulls on laxitives). It's like Shadow of the Colossus and Monster Hunter. The combat is decent and the thrill that you get when hunting bigger monsters is the best.\n\nYou can have up to 3 "pawns" that accompany you on your endeavors. They are handy. The ai isn't dreadfully awful. Keep in mind this game came out originally in 2012. Even with that, it's aged pretty well. You shouldn't play this game for the overwhelming amazing graphics, cause you won't find it. You will find instead a pretty solid rpg. In a lot of ways, this game has got the dragon killing aspect down to a science. It delivers on the action and intensity in spades when facing massive creatures.\n\nHowever as I mentioned earlier, the world is just a lil on the empty side. It's not like its barren. It's more like if football was played on a field double its usual length. You'll see intense skirmishes and action when it happens but then you'll also see equal amounts of running. Just running. People wonder why the Arisen can kill dragons? It's cause he gets in that cardio every day. How else would he have enough stamina to hold on while griffons and dragons try to shake him off 50 ft in the air. The story is also a lil convoluted, but hey least you get to stab a cyclops in the eye instead of just staying on the ground wacking an overenlarged hit box. It does a decent job in keeping track of where you hit massive monsters. You do damage to a cyclops knees, it falls. You shoot it in the eye, it's blinded. For what this game lacks in story and environment, it makes up with a polished combat system.\n\nFor a game that came out in 2012, it's a lot of fun. In my opinion the game is worth it and I recommend it. I hope that capcom realizes that this game has amazing potential and will come out with a sequel. Can you imagine an even more polished combat system, ai programming, and a DYNAMIC WORLD with a satisfying story?! I would love to see this game do well and usher in an even better sequel.","February 15","true","55.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

From start to finish a gem and with new game+ it has near unlimited replayability.\n\nA fantasticly crafted original world with lots of quests, some branching outcomes, and a party of Player created mind slaves! Did someone say Cannon Fodder? You guys distract that giant, scaleable monster, i'm getting outta here. Not to mention the referances to other games and anime. Even selling some of their gear from a certain hidden merchant.\n\nThe Pawn system is superb. You not only get 1 fully customizable pawn, but also access to every pawn created by other players. Not to mention they will help remind you what your suppose to be doing on quests or give you hints when your just can't remember what NPC you're suppose to be talking too. They also develp personalities based on your game play. GO COLLECT MY TREASURE, SLAVES!!\n\nThe amped up graphics look better than they did on the original release. It wasn't just some lame filter job into a port to PC. CAPCOM actually put in the work for this Port and it is noticable from the menu to the wolrd map.\n\nSo now the bad...\n\nThe game is true to the original release in which it still lacks character development in various NPCs. NPCs feel like they were strewn about, and matter in some way, but that project got left by the way side. Many of them have near to no purpose. The Dragon also chooses whom to display to you latter, but seemingly with no rhyme or reason. Threw multiple play throughs, I was shown characters I had little to no interaction with... still wondering about that...\n\nLastly... the Assassin is broken... YEAH I SAID IT! It's a broke OP class... I refuse to use it cause it takes away from gameplay and I cant wear my shmexy costumes with it.

Some may find the story a bit lackluster and the graphics aren't exactly cutting edge, but Dragon's Dogma more than makes up for it with it's engrossing combat and unique character develpment systems.\n\nThe base game is not too punishing, but if you're looking for a Dark Souls type of challenge the Dark Arisen portion of the game should more than satisfy your craving. There's also many things to keep you busy: crafting, questing, customizing your appearance, even raising npc affinity.

However like its console-version, it has good/bad associated with it, which could've been improved for the PC easily. Having those issues/problems not only conjure up bad memories, but also with that the frustration that we DO NOT expect to see in a PC game. If you've seen any review for this game when it first came out on console, notably AngryJoe's video, you would not be suprised to see the same issues visible on this port. Here is the summary of what he said and what I've seen to be different from console version:\n\nThe GOOD:\n- Improved gfx option\n- 60+ fps\n-  overall optimization\n- option to shut the annoying yappers that repeat same sentences repeatedly.\n- full use of multiple control setups\n- comes with the artbook and music\n- combat feels solid and the music and sound go well with it\n\nThe BAD:\nThis is where the frustration begins on several folds:\n- like the original, no multiple save file options. you screwed up? Start over last checkpoint.\n- you want to check your map? Press ESC, then select map option, press ENTER to use map. WHY? Is it that difficult to add a keyboard shorcut like say, "M" for map, "Q" for quest and so on?\n- why separate the functions that pop up with ESC key from the in-game inventory menu? Remember oblivion's menu system?\n- lip does not synch with the voice, but that's to be expected\n- enemies you've killed still spawn where you killed them before\n\n\nThe MIDDLE:\n- If you've played this game before and managed to ignore those problems, then it would be a fun experience for you. No doubt it is a great game, but that does not give us the excuse to overlook things that could've been fixed by Capcom easily. Perhaps a patch will solve it (finger crossed).\n\n- It's outdated by today's standard. But so are older classics that are still being played by us for the value they left in us. If that is not your cup of tea, then you will not be seeing much that you haven't seen in modern RPGs.\n\nI would recommend it to anyone who wanted to play it but could not or missed it somehow. It is far better on PC after all these years and worth adding to your library for what its worth. Just make sure you weigh in the good vs bad vs annoying aspects of the game before you decide to purchase.\n","January 16","true","10.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","5","7","3","0"

As you adventure, you gain gear, levels and a deeper understanding of the world around you. You can branch out from the initial 3 classes towards more specialized versions, or hybridize yourself and try something different. There is a ton of granularity in the choices you make.\n\nThe story is a bit thin textually, but like the great Dark Souls, a lot can be gleaned from a bit of optional scouring. The meat of the game is exploration and combat, and this game gives you an absolutely MASSIVE sandbox to do it in.\n\nDragons Dogma is easily one of the most satisfying RPG experiences I've had and at 30 dollars is an absolute no brainer. Give it a shot and you will not be disappointed.","April 18","true","33.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hydris/recommended/367500/","hydris","Hydris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hydris/","66 products in account","A decent game that leaves a lot to be desired; not from what is lacking, but the potential for improvements of what's currently presented.\n\nI consider the main appeal of the game being the AI companions that can learn and be trained to an extent. Their inclination stats which influences their behavior is important to attend to since counterproductive behaviors are possible. I felt the inclinations has both placed some interesting constraints on playing, yet some restrictions to what I would've done to prevent some bad habits imparting to the pawn. Compared to average game AI, they're smarter and more capable than average, but still bound to make some stupid mistakes. Unconventionally, the whole deal with character building in RPGs, I ended up paying more attention to customizing the main pawn than the player character.\n\nMostly, each class has a weakness to be covered by companions. I.e physical damage only classes while there are monsters vulnerable only to magic, or being grabbed by an enemy and needing a teammate to the rescue. However the AI companions, really depending how well trained, can be unreliable for some situations; worst case I can remember is Metal Golems and archers not attacking the floating medallions when I needed them to.\n\nAnother appeal is the attention to detail in non-generic ways. Examples, heads actually regrowing on a hydra- delayed by burning the wound. Character weight being a factor in weighing down or being carried off by a flighted monster. Counterfeited quest items can have some fun results later on and in other quests.\n\nMy first playthrough, I felt the challenge was fair. Later on NG+, the challenge expires as the enemies don't scale. Even for Hard Mode recontinuing after completing the game, the only thing noticeable is the greater XP and Gold rewards. Ultimately at a high level, one area in the game remains as an appropriate place where the player isn't overpowered for, and even then some of the bosses are leaning towards the easy side. The story gets questionable at first sometimes, but it turns out to be consistent.\n\nExpectations     Dragon May Cry: The RPG, considering the director and team behind it. There's some similarities, but a lot of the character's effectiveness relies on stats and equipment because of the way damage is calculated. I felt the countering attacks and dodging was quite easy and the timing required was lenient.    Other Opinions    For the RPG aspect, I felt the means of upgrading equipment and character were simplistic. For the action, only 6 skills per weapon (3 if Warrior) loadout were limiting.\nInventory items shared the same icons in an annoying way.\nThe game only has one save slot for a character, I'm mostly fine with it since a lot of character details (like appearance, class, augments) can be changed without starting over.    Experience     Played the game on Normal the first time. Then for NG+ switched the game difficulty to Hard.\nMost played vocations are Assassin and Mystic Knight; played the least of Sorceror and Mage. Had some fun with Magick Archer, but I didn't like magic bows skills as much I did the regular ones because of the lock-on and target tracking.","February 25","true","324.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The combat is phenomenal, and definitely lives up to the hype.  The skill system, classes, and gear have significant depth and are well done.  The pawn concept is also really well done.\n\nThe story is very bare-boned, and there isn't much in the way of character development.  But, the mythology and storyline does have some interesting twists, so its actually solid...just not a deep narrative.\n\nThe monsters are also fantastic D&D inspired types, but I do wish there was some randomizing of spawns in the world.

When the time came for Dark Arisen in 2013 i couldnt quite sink my teeth in it, because of the perfomance.

You can hire online pawns, and even hire your friends pawns but everything else about it doesent work. The rating, the gifts, etc.\nAlso there are some people mentioning that their saves become corrupted, when they hire a specific pawn. And they speculate that the pawn comes from on of the "Hacked saves". That is, from a save that was played on before the release, on the leaked version that is available on different torrent sites. I cant really confirm or deny this, and Capcom has been silent on the matter concerning "Hacked saves". They have, however, reported that the "Pawn sharing" is currently being investegated by their Techies.","January 18","true","51.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Many others followed in its wake, though none were able to fully match its finely-tuned balance and difficulty or otherworldly mystique.\n\nThen came Dragon's Dogma, late spring, 2012, a new project from some of Capcom's brightest talents.\n\nI had no idea what to expect the day this game came in the mail, expectations low coming off the heart-wrenching disappointment of Dark Souls. What I got was this: desolate solitude in a visually stunning, base infusion of Monster Hunter and Shadow of the Colossus, polished to perfection, offset by what was and still is one of the most brilliant and impressive A.I. companion systems I have ever seen.\n\nIt was a needed breath of fresh air, one that ceased to leave my PlayStation 3 for many months to come. The Dark Arisen rerelease only added to the pleasure, addressing minor complaints while significantly adding to the already high replay value with Bitterblack Isle, a punishing, seemingly endless dungeon crawl -- risk versus reward at its finest.\n\nBelated as it might be, this PC conversion is amongst the best ports Capcom has ever done, fabulously optimized and fully integrated into Steamworks right from the get-go; I would have sufficed with simply being able to play the game at a higher framerate (Dragon's Dogma pushed the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 *well* past their limits), but the addition of significantly increased distant LOD, higher resolution textures and improved post-processing are more than welcome additions to an already excellent game.\n\nThat's not to say it's entirely free from error; side quest progression is as annoying as it always was, guaranteed to push new players to reroll over canceled objectives. If that doesn't do it, then configuring one's pawn will, one of several gameplay mechanics that requires planning and foresight for best results. Dragon's Dogma has never held hands -- online reading is a must when it comes to the likes of crafting consumables or pawn inclination and personality.\n\nWhile some have derided the game for the above issues (and still do), I've always found myself torn in a different direction: this is a significantly misunderstood ARPG, forward-thinking and made with a lot of heart, qualities that, for me, outweigh its small missteps, no matter what they might be.","January 16","true","147.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Since I never bought it on console. It has a decent tutorial how to play the game and explained very well how to play the game it has the balance of complexity.\n\nAs for performance I am running a SLI 980 setup w/ i7-4790k. I am easily get over 60 FPS @ 4k. (I am not sure if there is SLI support, but I have not monitored to check, but if it doesn't thats impressive if it's only using a single 980 for 4k. lol)\n\nAs for combat and general gameplay I felt so many difference things. It gives that feel of a mmorpg because of the pawns, etc. I also really like the concept of how you can "hire" other players characters to be part of your team and such. So there is plenty to chose from so it does sorta have a mmo feel to it. The combat also reminded me a mixture of difficulty of Dark Souls, but with abilities and hack & slash it felt like Elder Scrolls Online (slightly). I also love the fact you can climb up large enemies or bosses to attack weak points that reminded me completely of Shadow of Colossus.\n\nMy only thing thats sorta like a mixture of a pro/con is that I like the concept of the crafting system in some ways, but it is a bit dull and could have been better. It isn't easy to make a good crafting system without potentially ripping off other games completely in some way now since Skyrim, ESO, and a few other mmo's already made near-perfect crafting system, but it isn't a huge downer. I was not a huge fan of the crafting in this game.\n\nAs for the size of the world I only have played the game up to the city. So I am not sure how "big" this game is, but I will be sure to edit my review when I get futher into the game.\n\n\nSo far if I was to give this game a rating between 10 and 10. I would give this game a: 10\n\nYou took some ideas from some of the greatest games and brought them into one nice little package and gave us a great game.

For me it was the type of game that affects you profoundly, that sets you in a different mood, a wonderful mood, and makes you crave and think about the game when you're not actually playing it, but just living your ordinary life. In short, it has an atmospheric and exciting world, superb combat, it feels original, innovative and intelligent, and just lovely in every way.\n\n\nEDIT: game works perfectly now! Not sure what fixed it, but right now I'm guessing my old gamepad wasn't compatible. I disconnected it and then deleted the games' config file, then ran in Win 7 mode.\n\n[I just started the game a moment ago and for the first time ever with a new release I'm having technical problems (must have been lucky).

The game supports a pretty wide variety of different playstyles: either you want to be a sorcerer, casting gigantic ice соcks at goblins from behind your allies' backs, or you prefer to get up close and personal with your enemies while doing your best devil may cry impression, or you're more of a "i want to press one button to spam tenfold arrows while occasionally pause to munch on stamina recovering mushrooms" person, or either two of those combined, you're going to be absolutely fine.\n- It doesn't hold your hand. Apart from being рiss easy past the initial phase of getting used to the combat/leveling/dialogue/loot/bosses mechanics it does the job of considering a player an intelligent human being very well. You can and you will ♥♥♥♥♥ up, whether it's some quest you didn't do or some area you've missed or whatever else.\n- Monster Hunter-esque.. ugh.. everything. Starting with the interface looking and sounding extremely similar and little things like the gathering spots, an item combination system, monsters dropping special loot if you damage their specific parts and overall similar comfiness, this game is the closest thing to MH on PC by far.\n\n\nCons:\n- Not enough Grigori.\n- It's not "immersive" if you're into that kind of thing. If you expect a bethesda game from Dragon's Dogma then don't even bother with this one. It's an offline MMO, the world of Gransys is bland and the closest thing to dead you can imagine. Not only it's unispiring visually and sonically, it doesn't really contain much in terms of content and most of it is just a couple of chests with goblins guarding them or a special cave with an even more special pointless mining spot. There are NPCs here and there with some quests you can only access at the special time during the main quest, but that's about it.\n- Terrible damage system which only shows much much later into the game. The late game, the BBI, is ALL about breaking these specific enemy defense threshhold numbers with your weapons which turns the game into a pointless grindfest. There's no point in learning bosses' attack patterns, their behaviour or what they're weak too. The only thing you need is to break a specific number by having a good enough weapon so you can actually deal more than 0 damage to this enemy. How you achieve it is entirely up to you, including some amazing ones like saving near a chest with a potential to spawn a good weapon and then killing yourself over and over until the desired item finally spawns, or another hot one like grabbing a couple of conqueror periapts, some blast arrows and letting the game play itself.\n- My urge to slit my wrists rises exponentially when I play warrior to get that delicious +20% strength augment.\n- They're masterworks all, you can't go wrong\n- Pray\n- They hold the advantage!\n- 'Tis weak to ice and fire both\n- Pray\n- Pray\n- It's much stronger than the common goblin\n- Whatleetbee\n- Pray","February 17","true","187.0"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","10","17","4","0"

The game as of the latest patch is running fairly well for me, and I'm having a blast with it.\n\nThe environments are particular design standouts, with attention given to realistic biomes, plus immersive audio, though not any real weather effects that I've seen so far. Combat is nice, but I find spellcasting aiming difficult. I play with an XBox One controller. Lots of nearly useless stuff to pick up makes this self-confessed Junk Looter very happy. Writing is OK; dialogue is less than OK. Pawn system is interesting. Bethesda could actually learn a thing or two from this title, and Capcom can learn a thing or two from Bethesda in turn.\n\nI wonder what the mid and end game will feel like. I'm afraid grinding may become necessary and too much of a chore. But right now I'm happy to come back to this title for hours on end. Oh, just a note. In order to make travel less annoying, when you start a new game for the first time, it's actually like NG+ apparently, with an eternal ferry stone, and some of the dialogue you hear may be NG+ dialogue (such as Selene's opening dialogue, perhaps?)\n\nCapcom, you've come a long way from your Resident Evil 4 port.

I played this because of the same feel it gave me from Dungeon/Dragons Shadow of Mystara. I rotted my childhood away at video arcades to 4man co-op with my classmates.\nI've listed how to make the game harder and definitely the hardest game I've played. Difficulty is exactly how difficult you want the game to be. The storyline is short and predicatable, if looking for a great storyline then this will disappoint. The sound effect, music, spells, combat has nothing to disappoint. They are great for the price considering you don't need to buy Dragon Dogma and Dark Arisen as with console release in separate prices. The port is great, constant 55-60FPS on Win10, 980Ti, full gamepad support on LogitechF710. No broken server connection on 100Mbps.\n10/10, I love the challenge-runs.

But playing DD Dark Arisen on PC is a blast. All movements are so smooth and in 100% accurate. Fighting mechanics are one of the best I have ever used in any games. And this is a big complement from a guy who played almost every single AAA game in past 5 years.  Man, story is so emotionally deep, raw and twisted.  I just can't believe how accurate this game is compare to my concept of ancient dragons times. I played it twice on Xbox 360 but here I will waste much more life. They took a 30 fps game and coded it to be 60. They enhanced the graphics as much as they could without making an entirely new engine.

I'm that big a fan :)\n\nArguably the better dragon-slaying game during the time of Skyrim's release, finally on PC, and finally in its well-deserved 60FPS+. A hidden shining gem from CAPCOM that wholly deserves a look, and is certainly deserving a position in any action RPGer's library. My personal console GOTY 2012-2013 :)\n+ The game is finally in its deserved 60FPS+(uncappable), instead of the barely 30FPS stutteryness on the consoles, and its a joy of motion all around!\n\n+ Consistent world design gives each location found in the game, major or minor, its own feel and gameplay, combined with a day-night cycle that changes the entire mood and difficulty as well.\n\n+ Solid sound direction that sounds right, when its right, how its right, supported by fitting, masterfully delivered background music.\n\n+ Expansive character creation that is more extensive than its competitor, Skyrim, with ensuing gameplay effects based on character weight. Heavier, larger characters burn and regenerate Stamina slower, can carry more, can grapple more effectively, but at cost of being bigger in hitbox, having trouble climbing onto a larger enemy, and opposite is true for lighter, smaller characters.\n\n+ Unique Pawn system that becomes your shadow throughout your adventures, assisting and learning from you, and are the main presense you have online, with other Arisen online can hire your Pawn for their own adventures, akin to a card trading game. Pawns are smart in combat, and informative outside of combat. Well-trained Pawns can become the crux that turns the tide during difficult times.\n\n+ Devil-in-the-details game mechanics one usually gets from a Japanese developer. Flask of oil thrown at the enemy coats them in oil, a debilitation, and makes them weak to fire. Getting wet makes you weak to lightning. Need to grapple a small enemy to open it for a partymate? Go for it! Need to climb a large enemy to get at its weak point to strike for massive damage? You can do that too!\n\n+ Combat is very well animated akin to the flashy combat of Devil May Cry's own series of games, and as such it constantly looks interesting and fitting for the situation. Magic is finally given its due in this regard, beautifully animated and powerfully impactful, which gives weight to the fact that these are powerful spells at their fingertips.\n\n+ Lengthy play similar to the length and size of Oblivion/Skyrim, on your first playthrough. Then you finish the game, and the rabbit hole goes deeper. Then you finish the game. Then you start the next with New Game Plus and learn even more. Then you try Dark Arisen content...\n\n+ Decisively Japanese take on a Western-based fantasy genre setting, complete with lore that goes above and beyond the game's borders, both in-universe, and out.\n\n+ Dark Arisen expansion content is for the dedicated player who wishes to master the heights of the game, learn more from the lore, and gain the best of loot and skill, easily another 50% to a very lengthy game.\n\n==========\n\n- Its a game from 2012, and even with the 1080p/60FPS+ support on top of reworked textures, upscaled fidelity, and the lot, its still obviously an HD rework re-release of a 2012 game on PC, even with the uncompressed textures. Chief issue here is the pop-in distances for NPC's and entities is still laughably short, and can be very noticeable.\n\n- Missing the real title theme song of Dragon's Dogma (B'z - Into Free [Dangan]), shamefully so.\n\n- The original game's incessant voice prompts for the Pawns became one of the main complaints of the game, and it can be again with the PC port, if you do not switch that off in Options or actively train your Pawn to be more quiet.\n\n- As well voice-acted the game is, lip sync outside of cutscenes is haphazardly silly.\n\n- Difficulty can run the gamut from challenging, to obfuscatingly difficult. Hard Mode for first-timers is not recommended. Requires a modicum of player skill and dedication to progress. Save points are few and far between, and can be punishingly far from one's destination.\n\n- Story is very plain at first glance, without any overruling drive for the player other than reclaiming the heart of the Arisen from the Dragon. Story only opens up after the defeat of the Dragon.\n\n- Dark Arisen expansion content is easily unlocked when the player is arguably not yet ready, and thusly can lead players into a spiky cliff of difficulty. Doesnt help the lore for Dark Arisen assumes you have completed the base game and thusly wont make sense to newcomers.\n","January 15","true","158.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's a great port made by capcom and i highly recommend to get this game.\n\nTo simplify all things, it's basically Shadow of the Colossus,Devil May Cry,Elder Scroll,Mass Effect,Dark Souls and Monster Hunter all had group sex and gave birth to a baby called Dragons Dogma.","January 20","true","72.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I'm that big a fan :)\n\nArguably the better dragon-slaying game during the time of Skyrim's release, finally on PC, and finally in its well-deserved 60FPS+. A hidden shining gem from CAPCOM that wholly deserves a look, and is certainly deserving a position in any action RPGer's library. My personal console GOTY 2012-2013 :)\n+ The game is finally in its deserved 60FPS+(uncappable), instead of the barely 30FPS stutteryness on the consoles, and its a joy of motion all around!\n\n+ Consistent world design gives each location found in the game, major or minor, its own feel and gameplay, combined with a day-night cycle that changes the entire mood and difficulty as well.\n\n+ Solid sound direction that sounds right, when its right, how its right, supported by fitting, masterfully delivered background music.\n\n+ Expansive character creation that is more extensive than its competitor, Skyrim, with ensuing gameplay effects based on character weight. Heavier, larger characters burn and regenerate Stamina slower, can carry more, can grapple more effectively, but at cost of being bigger in hitbox, having trouble climbing onto a larger enemy, and opposite is true for lighter, smaller characters.\n\n+ Unique Pawn system that becomes your shadow throughout your adventures, assisting and learning from you, and are the main presense you have online, with other Arisen online can hire your Pawn for their own adventures, akin to a card trading game. Pawns are smart in combat, and informative outside of combat. Well-trained Pawns can become the crux that turns the tide during difficult times.\n\n+ Devil-in-the-details game mechanics one usually gets from a Japanese developer. Flask of oil thrown at the enemy coats them in oil, a debilitation, and makes them weak to fire. Getting wet makes you weak to lightning. Need to grapple a small enemy to open it for a partymate? Go for it! Need to climb a large enemy to get at its weak point to strike for massive damage? You can do that too!\n\n+ Combat is very well animated akin to the flashy combat of Devil May Cry's own series of games, and as such it constantly looks interesting and fitting for the situation. Magic is finally given its due in this regard, beautifully animated and powerfully impactful, which gives weight to the fact that these are powerful spells at their fingertips.\n\n+ Lengthy play similar to the length and size of Oblivion/Skyrim, on your first playthrough. Then you finish the game, and the rabbit hole goes deeper. Then you finish the game. Then you start the next with New Game Plus and learn even more. Then you try Dark Arisen content...\n\n+ Decisively Japanese take on a Western-based fantasy genre setting, complete with lore that goes above and beyond the game's borders, both in-universe, and out.\n\n+ Dark Arisen expansion content is for the dedicated player who wishes to master the heights of the game, learn more from the lore, and gain the best of loot and skill, easily another 50% to a very lengthy game.\n\n==========\n\n- Its a game from 2012, and even with the 1080p/60FPS+ support on top of reworked textures, upscaled fidelity, and the lot, its still obviously an HD rework re-release of a 2012 game on PC, even with the uncompressed textures. Chief issue here is the pop-in distances for NPC's and entities is still laughably short, and can be very noticeable.\n\n- Missing the real title theme song of Dragon's Dogma (B'z - Into Free [Dangan]), shamefully so.\n\n- The original game's incessant voice prompts for the Pawns became one of the main complaints of the game, and it can be again with the PC port, if you do not switch that off in Options or actively train your Pawn to be more quiet.\n\n- As well voice-acted the game is, lip sync outside of cutscenes is haphazardly silly.\n\n- Difficulty can run the gamut from challenging, to obfuscatingly difficult. Hard Mode for first-timers is not recommended. Requires a modicum of player skill and dedication to progress. Save points are few and far between, and can be punishingly far from one's destination.\n\n- Story is very plain at first glance, without any overruling drive for the player other than reclaiming the heart of the Arisen from the Dragon. Story only opens up after the defeat of the Dragon.\n\n- Dark Arisen expansion content is easily unlocked when the player is arguably not yet ready, and thusly can lead players into a spiky cliff of difficulty. Doesnt help the lore for Dark Arisen assumes you have completed the base game and thusly wont make sense to newcomers.\n","January 15","true","158.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Scratch the gripe about limited fast travel, this game just went from gold to platinum, in my book.\n\nThe age of the game might be showing in its graphical assets and some gameplay design choices might seem like they don't belong in a modern game, but if you can live with that, this game offers a very enjoyable adventure. The battle system is fun and action packed. Especially entertaining is the massive mountable boss battles, which IMO put even God of War to shame. The classes (vocations) are varied and even offer skills that'll help you traverse the world and explore it's hidden corners.\nThe story is neglible at best and you can feel the age, but it still des enough to set it apart from a lot of other popular RPG's, offering engaging gameplay and a lot of character customization.","January 17","true","123.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The Dark Arisen expansion blew my mind with its new zone, Bitterblack Isle. It seemed to burrow a bit from the Souls atmosphere but improved the overall soundtrack and featured its own lore and storyline which overall is fantastic. The early game can feel very slow paced at times, but getting to this content is well worth the effort.\n\nWe also got the fabled infinite ferrystone, some new costumes and plenty of new hairstyles and such for those dressup lovers. There's no doubt about it, the character customization is quite strong with this one. And it's all here on the PC port! No 10k RC, though. Ugh. Once you beat the game you can buy the infinite scroll to recustomize as much as you want! Dressup lovers rejoice!\nDragon's Dogma qualifies as one of those "Flawed but awesome" types of games, not everything is perfect but if you can look past what isn't so great you'll really find yourself immersed in this game with hundreds of hours ready to blow. It's totally worth the money.\n\nSo what's awesome?\nThe combat is fantastic, and steers away from some of those other mindless button masher "ARPGs" out there.\nBosses actually have mechanics. Chimera kicking your bum? Grab on to his goat head and cut it off preventing those annoying spells. Cyclops throwing his club around? Burn it out of his hand or paralyze him with lightning! Gryphon not landing? Throw a goblin corpse down or something similar and bring that jerk down, latching on to him and eviserating his entrails as he tries to take off.\n\nThe classes are really fun and really offers a load of different playstyles to the RPG lovers.\nThe entire world and most of the items in it have their own innate properties which really adds a whole new layer of detail to the game. You can throw oil at enemies to make them take more fire damage, for example. The height and build of your character can affect this stuff too, heavier characters can carry more and have less trouble remaining attached onto enemies and storter characters may find themselves more mobile or able to fit in some small spaces that a taller character cannot.\n\nWhat are the flaws, though?\nOne thing is there's only one character slot per save, that's pretty annoying. There are ways around it, but wouldn't it be nice to have more characters that could access your storage to make leveling that second character easier? That's the 2nd thing that could be seen as annoying to minmaxers. Every time you level 10>100>200 the stats you gain are based on what class you are, and its permanent. So you may feel the need to plan your build ahead in advance, and it could lock you into a playstyle. You can gift via pawns thankfully, but still. I was really hoping capcom would have done something to ease this annoying part of the game. Hopefully mods and hex editing will open more options around it, but ugh.\n\nThe other thing is that the early game can feel very slow paced and cumbersome, the vanilla dragon's dogma didn't have the infinite ferrystone and there was only one Portcrystal per game. That probably costed the game a few positive reviews. The game starts out great, you get your heart literally stolen by a enormous dragon and he challenges you to beef up RPG style and get it back; The intro is quite strong.\nThen you pretty much end up being a kings errand boy for half of the game running around exploring and doing menial tasks, making the early game seem less appealing.\nOnce you get far though, you'll get rewarded with some pretty awesome battles and dungeons. The showdown with the dragon is FAN-FREAKING-TASTIC. Then you're rewarded with a new dungeon with plenty of shiny loots and bosses including the Ur Dragon who you can challenge online to contribute your damage to the server. Remember Infinity Blade's Clashmob? Something like that. There's offline too. It's pretty cool.\n\nConclusion, this is one fantastic game. It's well worth the money if you're in the mood to try a new open world ARPG.\n\nBrotip: The Wyrmking's Ring increases cast speeds by 15% just for being in your inventory, take it to the black cat and turn in the forgery! Don't turn the real one in!","January 17","true","119.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It is a flawed gem but a gem nevertheless.\n\nYou play as the Arisen, a fisherman/woman in the small town of Cassirdis when a dragon comes and raids the village. In your attempt to defend the village the Dragon steals your heart and choses you as the hero to go out and stop its destruction of your country Gransys.\n\nAs the Arisen you are able to command a mercenary race known as Pawns from the Rift Stone. Pawns are created characters that everyone can make and share with each other along the world. While having actual co-op would have been nice the pawn system is an interesting idea and adds charm to your game especially if you find a group of well made pawns with great skills, augments, armor, weapons, inclinations, and most importanty personality.\n\nI named my pawn Chuckles an arrogant lanky "Gentleman Bandit" with a deep voicewho frequently say that fighting ogres, dragons, bandits, and zombies was a waste of time and rob people along the path to Gran Soren, shot a bandit captian off a cliff. manage to push a bloody GORECHIMERA off a cliff to its demise with the help of another pawn named HANZ. robbed orphans of their meager money from a fountain in Gran Soren, and mocked a certain cousin of the Arisen who kept fainting on his doomed adventure to Witchwood\n\nAnd that was just for the 360 version, this time on PC he tried to stab a merchant i was escorting simply because she was picking up money on the road.\n\nAnd this is one of the biggest reasons why i love this game, Chuckles and my other friends pawns would always be entertaining to watch how their A.I would react and the Pawns can be really interesting IF YOU PUT THE EFFORT INTO MAKING THEM INTERESTING.\n\nI strongly recommend new players to take their pawn to the knowledge chairs in either Cassidis or Gran Soren as these chairs allow to\n\n1. Tell your pawn to shut up if you hate their chatter\n2. Change how they act in combat (You don't want your mage acting like a warrior for example)\n3. Change their personality (I've lost count how many Pawns just shout out STRENGTH IN NUMBERS ARISEN, DID IT!, WE HAVE TRIUMPH) in battle it quickly gets old.\n\nOnce you have your party set up you then can head to Gran Soren and begin your adventure as mostly everything is unlocked for you by the time you get to Gran Soren.\n\nYou can then pick better classes for your pawns such as Ranger, Sorcerer, and Warrior while the Arisen gets hybrid classes such as Magick Archer, Assassin, and Mystic Knight\n\nBy this point the story hits a dead end and basically stalls for you by finding missions the duke wants you to do while waiting to find the dragon even though its pretty obivious where it is.\n\nExploration is pretty fun and the world feels big there's alot of monster variety some of which i usually don't see in RPGs and oh boy is it satisfying to find one of the bigger monsters in the game like cyclops, chimeras, golems, and of course dragons.\n\nYou can climb up on to the larger monsters to get to their weakpoints similar to Shadow of the Colossus though they won't make it easy. Dragon's in particular can be a real pain to fight as the camera has trouble when near their weakpoint and tends to flip out making an already challenging fight frustrating at times.\n\nThe game has a surprising amount of depth to its gameplay with a large amount of status effects that can be applied to your character and the enemy with plenty of healing items in the game. Monsters tend to be more difficult at night and not having the proper equipment will spell failure for your party among your treks through the world of Gransys,\n\nNow there are sone major issues with the game that can be deal breakers for some of you. One of the biggest ones is the story is rather bad until the end and the side quests usually are not very good. This is espcially true for the notice board missions which are mostly filler quests like escort missions, fetch quests, collect X amouint of this item and the like you've seen in so many other RPGs.\n\nThe game also has romancable characters in the game and you can probably guess who a few of them are, your childhood friend Quina, The captian Mercedes, The Princess Aelinore and while yes they are romancable inculing unique scenes for them. There is something darker in this game's romance system\n\nWhat the game doesn't tell you is that EVERYONE is romancable. This is due to affinity which naturally builds just taking to someone let alone doing quests for that person. So what can happen is say you want to romance Mercedes okay you are doing her route and its getting near the end of the game. You want to rest up and manage your items before you go off to fight the Dragon. Well now Mercedes isn't your love interest anymore its the innkeeper of Gran Soren and there is no way to change it by that point. So remember  if someone is in love with you KILL THEM OFF lest you have the creepy midget jester as your damsel in distress.\n\nNow you're actually getting two games on this PC port as Dark Arisen comes with its expansion into Bitterblack Isle. Bitterblack Isle is alot of fun to explore especially if you're a Dark Souls fan as its overall style and tougher challenge and monsters remind me of that franchise\n\nI recommend being at least around level 50-60 on your first run through Bitterblack Isle. The second run however is a whole nother story as the main boss gets a huge difficulty spike and overall the monsters are much tougher this time around.\n\nBitterblack expands on some of the Arisen and Pawn backstory and offers two new NPC's and a bunch of cool loot and dark morbid locations to explore. This also has some of the best music in the game and is overall a very nice additon to the game for mulitple playthroughs\n\nOverall i very much love this game. Yes its got some major issues but ultimately they don't outweigh the good unique experience Dragon's Dogma has to offer. I believe their is potential for there to be a heavy contender for best RPG able to compete with the Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age, and Souls series if Capcom is willing to expand upon this series. This game a strong following for those who played it and i know many would love to see a Dragon''s Dogma 2 or a Western release of Dragon's Dogma Online though most would prefer Dragon's Dogma 2 instead with co-op and having their pawns as well\n\nFinal verdict 7 out of 10 overall by my personal enjoyment out of the game is a 9 out of 10\n\nGo and buy it!\n","January 15","true","106.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

After zapping it with a few arrows which don't seem to be doing much good, my minions are bashing it with their swords and spells, but I feel like I can do more, so I leap at it and cling onto its back and start digging my daggars into its neck.  It stumbles towards the edge of a deep drop and falls, with me still on its back to the floor below, cushioning my blow and killing the beast.  I hop off and run into the middle where a stone is waiting to be plucked from the ground, but as I do the room fills with giant tentacles and I have to run for it as there's no hope of staying in here alive for long.  As I head around the corner I come to a room full of tombs, with a treasure room at the end.  I can't get through the door, but there's a hole in the wall so I start pushing the lids off the tombs and from one a skeletal figure emerges.  We fight him for a minute of two and eventually down him at which point he drops a lever which fits into the wall and opens the door.  I plunder the treasure, run back into the tentacle room and blast hell for leather up the spiral passageway for what seems like an age, dodging more tentacles that are spring up in my path, but I can only run for so long without pausing for breath and I make it to the top just as my stamina runs out and I stumble out of the dungeon.  And that's just one short experience in the first couple of hours.\n\nHoly crap this is a good game.  Imagine Skyrim with waaaaaaaaay better combat, better levelling and professions, better loot, deeper, more expansive dungeons, and you've basically imagined Dragon's Dogma.\n\nI can't believe this one passed me by during the previous gen console era, but in some ways, I'm glad it did because I get to enjoy this fantastic HD port for PCs.  Capcom have done an excellent job on this - it flies along at a superb, stutter free framerate on my GTX970.  At the price it's an absolute steal.

Throw a goblin corpse down or something similar and bring that jerk down, latching on to him and eviserating his entrails as he tries to take off.\n\nThe classes are really fun and really offers a load of different playstyles to the RPG lovers.\nThe entire world and most of the items in it have their own innate properties which really adds a whole new layer of detail to the game. You can throw oil at enemies to make them take more fire damage, for example. The height and build of your character can affect this stuff too, heavier characters can carry more and have less trouble remaining attached onto enemies and storter characters may find themselves more mobile or able to fit in some small spaces that a taller character cannot.\n\nWhat are the flaws, though?\nOne thing is there's only one character slot per save, that's pretty annoying. There are ways around it, but wouldn't it be nice to have more characters that could access your storage to make leveling that second character easier? That's the 2nd thing that could be seen as annoying to minmaxers. Every time you level 10>100>200 the stats you gain are based on what class you are, and its permanent. So you may feel the need to plan your build ahead in advance, and it could lock you into a playstyle. You can gift via pawns thankfully, but still. I was really hoping capcom would have done something to ease this annoying part of the game. Hopefully mods and hex editing will open more options around it, but ugh.\n\nThe other thing is that the early game can feel very slow paced and cumbersome, the vanilla dragon's dogma didn't have the infinite ferrystone and there was only one Portcrystal per game. That probably costed the game a few positive reviews. The game starts out great, you get your heart literally stolen by a enormous dragon and he challenges you to beef up RPG style and get it back; The intro is quite strong.\nThen you pretty much end up being a kings errand boy for half of the game running around exploring and doing menial tasks, making the early game seem less appealing.\nOnce you get far though, you'll get rewarded with some pretty awesome battles and dungeons. The showdown with the dragon is FAN-FREAKING-TASTIC. Then you're rewarded with a new dungeon with plenty of shiny loots and bosses including the Ur Dragon who you can challenge online to contribute your damage to the server. Remember Infinity Blade's Clashmob? Something like that. There's offline too. It's pretty cool.\n\nConclusion, this is one fantastic game. It's well worth the money if you're in the mood to try a new open world ARPG.\n\nBrotip: The Wyrmking's Ring increases cast speeds by 15% just for being in your inventory, take it to the black cat and turn in the forgery!

The hitboxes are precise, and the moves are natural. Enemies have weak spots, there's a bonus damage for headshots, etc. etc.\n+YOU CAN CLIMB DRAGONS\n+Missions are scattered all over the world. Some of them are simple "fetch me X" quests, but they make you go to places you wouldn't normally go to during a normal "main quests only" walkthrough. There are lots of side locations that have a lot of detail put into them, but are easily overlooked.\n+Graphics, despite being quite dated, still look amazing, the game has cloth physics for world objects, capes and some armor pieces and hair physics. Smaller enemies ragdoll after death, and cyclops have jiggle effect when hitting their body parts. Broken crates and furniture collide with one another. EVERY DETAIL MATTERS. Oh, and there's also 4k or something, but If you're still sitting here reading this reviev and don't have the game already, you're most likely not rich enough to afford a 4k build.\n+The difficulty is fair, unless you're starting a new game on hard, if that's the case, you're gonna have a bad time.\nThere is a couple of kinda downsides that can be ignored.\n-story is kinda dull, there are no real choices affecting the game, but it's fun to follow, and it makes you fight bigger and BIGGER enemies with each quest.\n-voice acting is ok, lip sync is worse, and animations are the worst. There is only a few preset animations everyone in the world uses.\n-some inconveniences regarding the game technically being a GOTY - all the DLC are there and you get a couple of highly overpowered items at the start of the game, which are also worth quite a coin, if you don't like them.\nI've been playing this game for ages, I'm glad I can do it on PC now and show everyone how good I'm at it. Overall, I rate it 11/10 (I've taken 1 down because of the lack of japanese language pack, it's only fair that way)","January 15","true","117.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

After zapping it with a few arrows which don't seem to be doing much good, my minions are bashing it with their swords and spells, but I feel like I can do more, so I leap at it and cling onto its back and start digging my daggars into its neck.  It stumbles towards the edge of a deep drop and falls, with me still on its back to the floor below, cushioning my blow and killing the beast.  I hop off and run into the middle where a stone is waiting to be plucked from the ground, but as I do the room fills with giant tentacles and I have to run for it as there's no hope of staying in here alive for long.  As I head around the corner I come to a room full of tombs, with a treasure room at the end.  I can't get through the door, but there's a hole in the wall so I start pushing the lids off the tombs and from one a skeletal figure emerges.  We fight him for a minute of two and eventually down him at which point he drops a lever which fits into the wall and opens the door.  I plunder the treasure, run back into the tentacle room and blast hell for leather up the spiral passageway for what seems like an age, dodging more tentacles that are spring up in my path, but I can only run for so long without pausing for breath and I make it to the top just as my stamina runs out and I stumble out of the dungeon.  And that's just one short experience in the first couple of hours.\n\nHoly crap this is a good game.  Imagine Skyrim with waaaaaaaaay better combat, better levelling and professions, better loot, deeper, more expansive dungeons, and you've basically imagined Dragon's Dogma.\n\nI can't believe this one passed me by during the previous gen console era, but in some ways, I'm glad it did because I get to enjoy this fantastic HD port for PCs.  Capcom have done an excellent job on this - it flies along at a superb, stutter free framerate on my GTX970.  At the price it's an absolute steal.

Sure, there are a few issues with the UI, and the story is, while interesting, is not the best,  the combat is absolutely amazing; it borrows elements from all sorts of RPGs, from Skyrim to Dark souls and Monster Hunter. Nothing more satisfying than fighting a cyclops near a cliffside and slowly pushing it off the cliff to its death, would rate 8/8.\n\nThe pawn (companion) system is also amazing and is unique: you create and customise your own main pawn and they are sent out onto the rift for other players to borrow and use. While they are being borrowed, they can gain knowledge on quests, travelling in areas and most importantly, knowledge of how to defeat types of monsters, while also earning currency! You can also hire two other pawns, either offline from those within the game or other players' main pawns.\n\nClass customisation and specialisation is also quite flexible: you can start in one of three basic classes (fighter, ranger and mage) and branch out into specialisations of those classes or hybrid classes which effectively combine elements of two classes together. The system allows for min/max if you wish or simply just experimenting and having fun with the different classes (as the slight cost of unoptimised stat growth).\n\nAll in all, that's all I have to say about it for now and I would definitely recommend buying it based on what I've completed so far.

The combat is the best i have ever seen in RPG or any other game especially with the big creatures.\nThe fighting is (cinematic) in a way that one climbs on to the creatures and attacks them there is no QTE it's all real time player controlled combat, this is the way i expect good next gen games to do Monster combat from now on instead of ankle slashing combat like Elder Scrolls and Witcher still use.\n\nThe character customization is great and it is much better than other games i have played.\n\nTho it's not all good there are some unnesessary problems with the game the biggest one is the awful save system.\nYou only have ONE save file for the entire game, it is stupid and makes no sense. To fix the save system you have to disable steam cloud for the game and manually copy and backup the save file from steam userdata location everytime you want to save the current savefile to your own location for later use.\n\nOther big problem is you cannot edit your character after the game starts, yes there are two buyable artefacts that can do it but they cost a big load of ingame crystals and the other one is only available after the game is finished this is  dumb and over complicated mechanic. Just put the customization options in to the barber shop and dont make things over complicated for no reason.\n\nThird problem is there is no normal fast travel system in the game there is some kind of weird fast travel buyable stone system that you have to drop in the travel points, again why so simple game mechanic needs to be over complicated especially as there is no mounts so traveling by running is very slow and becomes boring very quickly with the quickly respawning enemies.\n\nOverall it's a really good game and i'm glad it found it's way to pc, the pc port is pretty decent no huge problems with it and i think the price at 30 euros is a fair amount as it includes all the dlc for the game.","January 17","true","67.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you've found yourself enjoying long hours of exploration in games like Skrim, Dragin Age, and Fallout then this will suit your fancy. But where the greater bulk of the adventure in those games relies on objective markers and sad babysitting fetch quests to fill-in content to make you feel like its a full experience, DA puts you right there in fray of the situation-whether it be a puzzle or a tricky enemy without much of an explanation. What I mean by this is that the tutorials are either absetn or out right none existant. This both good and bad because the game's mechanics are plenty strong enough to hold up with out an explanation. Still though, a little hand holding would be nice for the noobies I suppose. Spend two hours figuring out that all you needed to do was pull the lever or turn the game off, no one gives a ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThere's far too much to explain in full detail to convince you why you should pick up this game, but I suppose I should start with the replayability.\n\nIts there. Its really, really there. In Dragons Dogma you have a choice between 9 different vocations (Playstyles) that all include the Fighter, Mage, Strider, Sorcerer, Ranger, Warrior, Mystic Knight, Magic Archer, and Assassin. Each of these classes has various skills and augments that are awarded to you after a certain amount of time of usage with each class. Each one has a specific focus in combat and each one has a severe weakness opposed to the other classes.\n\nFor example the Mage vocation specializes in healing and buffing team mates, while sorcerer focuses on offense spells and buffing allies. There's a hundred different ways to build a main character, and even more ways to do it for a pawn.  Each vocation has a max rank of about 10 and after each level up in that vocation your given more skills to master, which will turn you into a better fighter.\n\nThese skills can be mapped to the controller (Or keyboards) quick memory button so you can use an array of different skills in battle. At any time you can customize the placement of each skill, and can even keep certain core abilities even if you've switched an entirely different class. Not only this, but you can customize your pawns appearance and skillset as well, opening up the game to so many friggen posibilities of Pawn and Arisen combination its crazy. Owing to the many categories and variety of vocation, you can switch to all of these classes at any time, no need to start a new game and waste more time playing what you don't wanna. On top of the level 200 cap (It takes dozens of hours to even get to rank 50.), you can also do new game plus for some revived carnage and character building.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that some of these vocations combines the best of each class into one for some even better character making. For example, the first three vocations are strider, fighter, and mage. Their advanced classes basically super charge what they already did well, but the final three vocations specialize in combing the essense of all three forms of combat into one (Magic, Endurance, and Mellee Work). The Magic Archer is just that-a guy/girl with a bow and a staff.\n\nWeird combos. Totally  worth it when you find a class thats just for you.\n\nWhat really gives you the idea that the game intends on you to repeat it is the mistakes it allows you to make for not doing enough in certain quests or not going the extra mile for pleasing certain people. For example I had an oppurtunity to babysit someone's overpriveleged kid and because I didn't adhere to ALL of her blasphemous tasks, I barely got good enough weapons and armor as a direct result of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t bronze Idol she gave me (The highest grade was gold). So you gotta pay attention and really give a ♥♥♥♥ about the NPCs (I'm not just talking about listening either, dude. You really have to follow the little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and not bump into her when she wants to race. Get her water. All that ♥♥♥♥. Totally unrelated to monster hunting. Only way to get the best gear the post main game.)\n\nVery replayable game.\n\nThe combat is monster hunter with more open world stuff added to it to make the game comparable to games like Skyrim. Its realistic and everything has weight and momentum. Don't attack too much without a block or counter plan. Learn the ins and outs of combat as soon as you can and really have fun with the different styles of movement.\n\nTrust me, I am.\n\nI used to run with a Strider on New Game plus to get all my core augments and I'm learning some awesome things about that class such as its double jump ability and faster arrow pull on the short bow. Its also capable of climbing up and around monsters faster than anypone else so thats cool. The speed and precision make this character pefect for close to longer range combat both with a bow and with daggers.\n\nI now run with an Assassin build with Gale Harness (Wind magic that buffs speed 20%), Master Kill, and Thousand Bites. This class has become my all time favorite because unlike the others it combines great ranged abilities with fantastic close range abilities not to mention great mobility with double jump and evade with the dagger ability. On that note, ranged weaponry in this game is fantastic.\n\nCan't stress that enough. They really put thought and time into both magic and bow and arrow ranged attacks.\n\nYou'll feel as satisfied fighting a gang of bandits as you do fighting a cyclops and both enemies have secrets and tricks to easily being beaten. For example just blind the ♥♥♥♥ out of the Cyclops with arrows. Easy win. The enemies arent' always easy though and frankly require practice and style to bring down. This isn't a simple swing and kill scenario-the monsters can down you with one swipe of their claws or talons. There are also giant Chimeras, Griffins, Cyclops demons, and don't forget the 10 headed snake demon.\n\nTread at your own peril. Do not run into the fight with your balls hanging out and always maintain an everwatchful eye in the dark.\n\nAll in all, there's too much I think to explain why you should get this game. But above all I think the combat and replayability of the story are great points. The third and strongest point would be that its great fun creating your own character and pawn to compliment each other on the battlefield.","January 31","true","157.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/keksos/recommended/367500/","keksos","Keksos der Grosse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/keksos/","200 products in account","This game simply is amazing. I played the original game on PS3 and can't even begin to count how many hours I spent traveling through the world, herding enemies with my group of carefully selected pawns and collecting stuff I never need but still want to find cause that's how the Arisen rolls. It's not Skyrim, it's not Dark Souls, it's not another dull JRPG and most of all it's not a derivative of anything you can find out there. The closest I'm able to come up with is what would happen if Golden Sun and Dark Souls had a love child. And that would be pretty unique und hard to imagine, wouldn't it?\n\nAnd why yes, this game is. I call it a fully fledged multi-companion action RPG with some platformable passages, an actual difference between day and night, tunables classes/AI for most of your companions and a massively open world. Gameplay wise, you'll find many similarities to JRPGs but presented in a way where situational awareness and skill choices play the most important roles. Hard to find something comparable! Kind of like Brütal Legend and it's squad command system. And tiny bit of Pokemon.\n\nBut don't expect any Hollywood type storytelling. The game is rather subtle with a necessity to explore the depths of things on your own. There will be no handholding, no obvious solutions and no spotlights telling you where to go. Plus, the main story doesn't make much sense until you're two thirds into it. BUT! That's also kind of the beauty since it gives you enough room to live in this wondrous world of yore. Japanese ideas of european medieval yore, that is - talking about boob plates and armor sexism.\n\nAnyway, as many other people already pointed out before me, this is a very well-done PC port. It's faithful to the original visuals and works just as smooth as you'd expect from something that's been around a while. Plus, they got rid of the rather annoying title screen J-Rock theme which never contrasted well with the game's actual music. Highly recommend! In fact, there's naught to loose by buying it right now while it's hot and steamy.","February 4","true","96.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NykkiJo/recommended/367500/","NykkiJo","Nykki Jo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NykkiJo/","89 products in account","Thank you so much, Capcom, for this flawless PC port without DRM (besides Steam).\n\nThis game makes use of the videogame medium like no other. Games are replayable, social, and explorable. Dragon's Dogma utilizes these idiosyncrasies perfectly in awesome fun game filled with thrilling combat, lore, and humor.\n\nReplayabilityMost games include New Game+ as an extra, but Dragon's Dogma’s story is ideally experienced in an infinite cycle. If you like to make the most effective character, make interesting characters, collect all the fashion items, unlock all the crafting recipes, pursue your one true Beloved, or just analyze a rich story and setting, you will replay the game many times. Initially, bandits will be nearly impossible to fight, but your character will be mowing through them before NG+. However, there will be a few challenges even after a NG+ or two in the main campaign. Bitterblack Isle and the Ur-Dragon, however, will be challenging, even at max level. Nothing besides your personal ability stops you from entering any area or facing anything, though, so feel free to prove me wrong by defeating Daimon before level 15!\n\nLimited Social InteractionThis is a single-player game with online connectivity. (Off-line with pre-made pawns is always an option.) Dragon's Dogma encourages a cooperative community for us to share our skills, experience, and creativity without directly speaking. As the Arisen, you will have complete control over the development of one fully-customizable party member known as a Pawn. It will fight by your side, learn techniques from you via a complex AI system presented through Inclinations and Bestiary Knowledge, and automatically be hireable for RC by other players to benefit from your training. If that other player shows your Pawn a new strategy, it will bring the new information home to share with you! The Pawn system also allows for reviewing with helpful/humorous preset comments and trading via gifts. This way, you can actually earn recognition for the Utilitarian/Challenge pawn with a Triple-Dragonforged Delta Guard you poured days into building. You can also see other players’ amazing (or mostly shoddy) work. We all kind of play together as a community to achieve the same goals, which I find really sweet.\n\nExplorationThere are hundreds of hours of exploration. I’m still learning things after hundreds of hours across platforms! The map is big and extends far beyond the scope of the story. It also has a lot of hidden verticality for the platforming fanatic. The From a Different Sky quests really highlight this feature through a (frustratingly) fun minigame. If you like lore and story, Dragon’s Dogma has an inexhaustible amount of lore to investigate. The setting of Gransys has a rich history, evidenced in the variances of architecture, quest and NPC dialogue, and the costumes of the other Arisens. The characters are all interdependent and political. Many people accuse the game of having minimal story. It’s true that the main story line dialogue is mostly to-the-point about you being an undead hero of prophecy come to rid the land of an ancient dragon (or just run some errands for the Duke who wishes to delay you at all costs). However, dig deeper into their motivations and relationships, and there is definitely an amazing story.\n\n\nAwesome Fun to Play\nCombat in Line with Monster Hunter or Dark Souls\nAlso, the combat is actually fun. In a lot of games, I sludge through combat, waiting for more story. The combat is something of a story, though. Today, my Arisen oiled the wings of a Griffon with arrows, and grasped onto its legs as it lifted from the ground to flee. Holding on for dear life as the Griffon was gaining altitude, my Arisen gained a firm grip and drove fiery daggers into the beast’s flesh until both its wings were set ablaze. She rode the burning griffon to the ground where her pawns finished it off. I was so scared the whole time that I’d lose my grip. That wasn’t even a quest, just a random encounter! I'm not going to lie, though. Those random quick-time events were so much easier on the PS3.\n\nThe Most Quotable Game\nThe dialogue is all so well-written. After hearing the pawns yell “STRIKE THE TAIL!” in battle and watching your favorite cutscenes—“MY TALISMAN.. MY RING..”—thirty times, you will be quoting DD:DA with the rest of us. "Unstinting, you say?"\n\nRomance!\nDragon’s Dogma subverts the Damsel in Distress cliché in a hilarious way. The Arisen can be male or female, and the “damsel” can be nearly any NPC in the game. By any, I mean you can seriously accidently get married to gross old men, already married women, and children. The game keeps track of your “affinity” with all NPCs, which is affected by given gifts and interactions. There are tricks to getting who you want, but something always seems to go wrong and you end up with Fournival or Caxton as your Beloved (mega ew). It's a hilarious feature that lends some anticipation and mystery to the climax cutscene.\n\nRidiculous People\nThe characters are as ridiculous as the dialogue. The cast includes a foreign rich girl who pretends to be a knight, an overly flirtacious girl who opens a shop with access to an exclusive master weaponsmith through unreturned favors, a villager who pretends to be an adventurer only to die along the easiest paths (voiced by Vic Mignogna no less! haha!), a rarity trader who frequents the local counterfeiter, the dreamy Night’s Champion, and so many others.\n\nIn short, buy this game immediately.

I am just playing on Normal Mode, and it doesn't feel extremely hard to the point that I get overly frustrated, nor do I find it too easy. I never played the original game on PS3 or Xbox 360, but I still wanted to get this as it looked like a really good game. From what I have experienced so far, there are only a few things that I think could have been better.\n\n1) When you do the normal run, not sprinting, you move extremely slowly.\n2) When you actually sprint, it drains your Stamina ridiculously fast.\n3) There is no roll or quickstep feature, which I find to limit me in combat because I do not use a shield and can't block, I either have to jump and sprint away from the enemies attacks which puts me out of the action, or just let them hit me.\n\nHowever I do want to say that the devs did a great job in porting this from console. It runs on 60fps, smooth as applebutter without any frame drops. Maybe if they had done a better job with the graphics that would have been even better, but I don't really mind that much, at least it isn't such I problem that I can't play.\n\nWhether or not you played the original, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Action RPG's, or Open World exploration games.\n\nEDIT: The slow walking is because of how many items you are carrying and your overall weight because of said items.\nThe fast stamina drain is because of the size of my character and that determining his endurance.","January 15","true","32.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

First, it's combat, the second, it's pawn system. Both unique to Dragon's Dogma alone.\n\nWhat drew me into the game was when I first scaled a giant monster and start swinging attacks at it's head while holding for dear life. Though you won't be doing this all the time, it certainly is a combat feature that stands out. When fighting smaller mobs, the combat plays out similar to games like Dark Souls or Monster Hunter. You'll be using the learned combat skills and spells that you've acquired to wreck havoc on enemies that stands in your way. These skills will drain your stamina bar, so managing regular attacks and special attacks will be key to your survival. The combat overall is very player skill based, but has all the pre-planning of equipment and skill management that people have come to love about RPGs.\n\nThe ally system, or "Pawn" system of the game is especially interesting. You create your own Pawn, it's appearance, and class, and you'll be able to level it up while setting up it's skills to compliment your desired party make up. The interesting part of this is, that Pawn you designed will be uploaded into the game's server and exported into other people's games. Other players will then hire it and will bring back treasures given to it back into your game, as well as knowledge of quests completed in other people's games. You of course, will also be able to hire other people's pawns into your game. This passive online feature helps create a connection to the greater world of Dragon's Dogma. It's one of the game's most unique features, and in my opinion, one of it's best.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nYFqwfvi5Y\nAs far as equipment, exploration and story is concerned it's pretty average to be honest. The stat and equipment is pretty run of the mill RPG, nothing you haven't seen before. The exploration, though vast in scale, is not nearly as interesting as exploring worlds in other games like Skyrim. The story of the game is pretty forgettable, and certainly was not an aspect that kept me playing.\n\nThe presentation of the game is acceptable. Keeping in mind, the game was originally released in 2012, the PC port being so late, it definitely shows some age. Compared to more contemporary AAA games, the game's low texture resolution, dated lighting, and lower polygon meshes become very apparent. It's not an ugly game, and still looks great, but it's age definitely shows.\n\nThough there is much to love about the game but it's not perfect. The game suffers from a lot of rinse and repeat gameplay loops. So basically there's a lot of repetition and grinding involved. The traversing in the game seem to be inspired from RPGs of old, before quick travel, as quick traveling is something that is earned, and a valuable commodity, rather than a convenience feature that we've grown accustomed to from other open world RPGs. And as mentioned before, the story is very forgettable. Hell, I stopped paying attention to it altogether.\n\nOverall, Dragon's Dogma is a great ARPG with a very enjoyable combat system, and an unique party system. Though it's other parts are a little mundane, this is a rare case where the sum of it's parts, is greater than it's whole.\n\nPros:\n- Excellent combat\n- Climbing giant mobs is exhilarating\n- Passive online "Pawn" system is well conceived\n- Large overworld map\n- Addictive gameplay loop\n\nCons:\n- Slightly dated graphics\n- Large world relatively uninteresting to explore in detail\n- Traversing can be grindy\n\n► Review Created on Update: 18 January (last update date)\n► Hours played: 25\n► Completion Status: Incomplete\n► This copy of Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen was purchased on Steam","January 25","true","49.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Not better graphics, not better story but better gameplay and a true RPG experience.\n\nPros - Heavy RPG elements, open world, progression feels natural as does world.\n\nCons - Looks pretty awful. (Yet doesn't always. Just proves better graphics don't always mean more immersion. IN fact I prefer first peson games for immersion but this game has some great immersive elements.)\n\nI can't quite put my finger on it yet but this game is unique and very special IMHO. Not perfect but I can't quit playing it. I own Fallout 4, Witcher 3, GTA V etc. and this is the game I want to play. It makes me think of Dungeons and Dragons for some reason - I don't know what I am saying, except everyone should give this game a chance. Kinda feels like Dragon Age Origins with better mechanics and actually fun to play, just doesn't look as good.\n\nEDIT: It's the small things, like the world being just big enough for the lack of fast travel and difficulty spikes early on. Wolves attempting to roll in the grass to put out a fire if you set them ablaze. Only being able to tell if night is coming by the light in the sky, position of the sun and the ambient sounds in the game, For one thing, the graphics are NOT bad, just really show their age but the sound design is amazing. I see so many things the witcher 3 and DA:O get credit for, but really it's lifted from this game, or seems that way.

I am just playing on Normal Mode, and it doesn't feel extremely hard to the point that I get overly frustrated, nor do I find it too easy. I never played the original game on PS3 or Xbox 360, but I still wanted to get this as it looked like a really good game. From what I have experienced so far, there are only a few things that I think could have been better.\n\n1) When you do the normal run, not sprinting, you move extremely slowly.\n2) When you actually sprint, it drains your Stamina ridiculously fast.\n3) There is no roll or quickstep feature, which I find to limit me in combat because I do not use a shield and can't block, I either have to jump and sprint away from the enemies attacks which puts me out of the action, or just let them hit me.\n\nHowever I do want to say that the devs did a great job in porting this from console. It runs on 60fps, smooth as applebutter without any frame drops. Maybe if they had done a better job with the graphics that would have been even better, but I don't really mind that much, at least it isn't such I problem that I can't play.\n\nWhether or not you played the original, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Action RPG's, or Open World exploration games.\n\nEDIT: The slow walking is because of how many items you are carrying and your overall weight because of said items.\nThe fast stamina drain is because of the size of my character and that determining his endurance.","January 15","true","32.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NykkiJo/recommended/367500/","NykkiJo","Nykki Jo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NykkiJo/","89 products in account","Thank you so much, Capcom, for this flawless PC port without DRM (besides Steam).\n\nThis game makes use of the videogame medium like no other. Games are replayable, social, and explorable. Dragon's Dogma utilizes these idiosyncrasies perfectly in awesome fun game filled with thrilling combat, lore, and humor.\n\nReplayabilityMost games include New Game+ as an extra, but Dragon's Dogma’s story is ideally experienced in an infinite cycle. If you like to make the most effective character, make interesting characters, collect all the fashion items, unlock all the crafting recipes, pursue your one true Beloved, or just analyze a rich story and setting, you will replay the game many times. Initially, bandits will be nearly impossible to fight, but your character will be mowing through them before NG+. However, there will be a few challenges even after a NG+ or two in the main campaign. Bitterblack Isle and the Ur-Dragon, however, will be challenging, even at max level. Nothing besides your personal ability stops you from entering any area or facing anything, though, so feel free to prove me wrong by defeating Daimon before level 15!\n\nLimited Social InteractionThis is a single-player game with online connectivity. (Off-line with pre-made pawns is always an option.) Dragon's Dogma encourages a cooperative community for us to share our skills, experience, and creativity without directly speaking. As the Arisen, you will have complete control over the development of one fully-customizable party member known as a Pawn. It will fight by your side, learn techniques from you via a complex AI system presented through Inclinations and Bestiary Knowledge, and automatically be hireable for RC by other players to benefit from your training. If that other player shows your Pawn a new strategy, it will bring the new information home to share with you! The Pawn system also allows for reviewing with helpful/humorous preset comments and trading via gifts. This way, you can actually earn recognition for the Utilitarian/Challenge pawn with a Triple-Dragonforged Delta Guard you poured days into building. You can also see other players’ amazing (or mostly shoddy) work. We all kind of play together as a community to achieve the same goals, which I find really sweet.\n\nExplorationThere are hundreds of hours of exploration. I’m still learning things after hundreds of hours across platforms! The map is big and extends far beyond the scope of the story. It also has a lot of hidden verticality for the platforming fanatic. The From a Different Sky quests really highlight this feature through a (frustratingly) fun minigame. If you like lore and story, Dragon’s Dogma has an inexhaustible amount of lore to investigate. The setting of Gransys has a rich history, evidenced in the variances of architecture, quest and NPC dialogue, and the costumes of the other Arisens. The characters are all interdependent and political. Many people accuse the game of having minimal story. It’s true that the main story line dialogue is mostly to-the-point about you being an undead hero of prophecy come to rid the land of an ancient dragon (or just run some errands for the Duke who wishes to delay you at all costs). However, dig deeper into their motivations and relationships, and there is definitely an amazing story.\n\n\nAwesome Fun to Play\nCombat in Line with Monster Hunter or Dark Souls\nAlso, the combat is actually fun. In a lot of games, I sludge through combat, waiting for more story. The combat is something of a story, though. Today, my Arisen oiled the wings of a Griffon with arrows, and grasped onto its legs as it lifted from the ground to flee. Holding on for dear life as the Griffon was gaining altitude, my Arisen gained a firm grip and drove fiery daggers into the beast’s flesh until both its wings were set ablaze. She rode the burning griffon to the ground where her pawns finished it off. I was so scared the whole time that I’d lose my grip. That wasn’t even a quest, just a random encounter! I'm not going to lie, though. Those random quick-time events were so much easier on the PS3.\n\nThe Most Quotable Game\nThe dialogue is all so well-written. After hearing the pawns yell “STRIKE THE TAIL!” in battle and watching your favorite cutscenes—“MY TALISMAN.. MY RING..”—thirty times, you will be quoting DD:DA with the rest of us. "Unstinting, you say?"\n\nRomance!\nDragon’s Dogma subverts the Damsel in Distress cliché in a hilarious way. The Arisen can be male or female, and the “damsel” can be nearly any NPC in the game. By any, I mean you can seriously accidently get married to gross old men, already married women, and children. The game keeps track of your “affinity” with all NPCs, which is affected by given gifts and interactions. There are tricks to getting who you want, but something always seems to go wrong and you end up with Fournival or Caxton as your Beloved (mega ew). It's a hilarious feature that lends some anticipation and mystery to the climax cutscene.\n\nRidiculous People\nThe characters are as ridiculous as the dialogue. The cast includes a foreign rich girl who pretends to be a knight, an overly flirtacious girl who opens a shop with access to an exclusive master weaponsmith through unreturned favors, a villager who pretends to be an adventurer only to die along the easiest paths (voiced by Vic Mignogna no less! haha!), a rarity trader who frequents the local counterfeiter, the dreamy Night’s Champion, and so many others.\n\nIn short, buy this game immediately.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/keksos/recommended/367500/","keksos","Keksos der Grosse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/keksos/","200 products in account","This game simply is amazing. I played the original game on PS3 and can't even begin to count how many hours I spent traveling through the world, herding enemies with my group of carefully selected pawns and collecting stuff I never need but still want to find cause that's how the Arisen rolls. It's not Skyrim, it's not Dark Souls, it's not another dull JRPG and most of all it's not a derivative of anything you can find out there. The closest I'm able to come up with is what would happen if Golden Sun and Dark Souls had a love child. And that would be pretty unique und hard to imagine, wouldn't it?\n\nAnd why yes, this game is. I call it a fully fledged multi-companion action RPG with some platformable passages, an actual difference between day and night, tunables classes/AI for most of your companions and a massively open world. Gameplay wise, you'll find many similarities to JRPGs but presented in a way where situational awareness and skill choices play the most important roles. Hard to find something comparable! Kind of like Brütal Legend and it's squad command system. And tiny bit of Pokemon.\n\nBut don't expect any Hollywood type storytelling. The game is rather subtle with a necessity to explore the depths of things on your own. There will be no handholding, no obvious solutions and no spotlights telling you where to go. Plus, the main story doesn't make much sense until you're two thirds into it. BUT! That's also kind of the beauty since it gives you enough room to live in this wondrous world of yore. Japanese ideas of european medieval yore, that is - talking about boob plates and armor sexism.\n\nAnyway, as many other people already pointed out before me, this is a very well-done PC port. It's faithful to the original visuals and works just as smooth as you'd expect from something that's been around a while. Plus, they got rid of the rather annoying title screen J-Rock theme which never contrasted well with the game's actual music. Highly recommend! In fact, there's naught to loose by buying it right now while it's hot and steamy.","February 4","true","96.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

The only Dragon's Dogma experience I had before this game was Dragon's Dogma Online and boy, this is everything I want in an RPG. Combat is better than a lot of RPG's I've played in the past, but of course that opinion will differ from person to person. I've never played the PS3 version but I can say the game runs really smooth (I would hope so) on my rig, using a GTX 970. I haven't beaten the game yet nor do I think I will for a long time due to how much there is to do should you pace yourself and explore everything in the game, but I can say without a doubt this game is a steal for $30 and would recommend you or whoever reading this to buy it!

As far as I can tell they haven't changed anything, but it's very clear the graphics/visuals have been cleaned up. Little details have also been added to the environment (if you want a good example, look down at the water in the prologue gameplay, when you start the new game straight away. Puddles have never looked so good!). So for anyone who has already played this on console previously, and is thinking about getting it for PC...\n\nDO IT!!\n\nFor those who are new to this game, I assure you won't be disappointed! All the customisation dlc packs that were available when it came out on console are now already in the game. This has to be one of the best ports to PC I know of, there are a lot of developers who learn a thing or two from this shining example.

WOW!\nI just finished my first run ever and I'm a bit stunned, courtesy of the finale. See if I have my main pawn resembling my boyfriend ever again...\nOf this game I really loved:\n1) The settings (sometimes I just took random walks and "enjoyed the sun");\n2) The plot: the bittersweetness of which I found gentle, not overbearing at all;\n3) Enemies: they were cool both in the looks and in the attacks, and I never really felt rushed during the quests;\n4) The fact that some things can be done only at a certain time of the day or night: it adds something realistic to it.\n\nAnd also, I learned to pay  way  more attention to stats, which can only do me good in the future. In this regard especially, the game is very clear and simple, it doesn't leave you guessing.\n\nUnfortunately, the things I didn't like are very few, but consistent:\n1) Too many bugs. I've lost the count of the times I had to reload the game. NPCs not showing up when they were supposed to, getting stuck in a hydra, map not showing and happily freezing the game.\n2) Combat. It was a strange sensation, but the more I advanced in the game, the more I felt like I was hitting sacks of sand or something. I'm not sure why, but not even the bosses gave me that heart-clenching sensation, that tension that I'm so used to when dealing with angry dragons the size of the Empire State Building.\n3) Equipment. I don't know if I'm missing something big, but while I get that some classes can't use some weapons, why can't I put on that armor I like so much  because of my class . It kinda bothers me, but maybe I don't understand something important.\n\nAll in all, anyways, I am very satisfied and happy to have bought it.\n9/10","January 31","true","123.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

I played it to bits on the PS3 so when I saw it coming to PC I hurried and snatched a copy as well. The controlls on a pc controller works smoothly and the gameplay is fluid. It has a really high replay-value as there is alot to do and you might easily miss quests on your first run through (one involving crossdressing if there are any males in your current party). The normal setting is a good introduction to the game but if you try hardmode with the Bitterblack Isle dungeon you will really get a whooping if you ain't on your toes.\n\nYou also get Pawns that were made by other players that can assist you in a quest - if you get a Pawn that is experienced with certain quests they can actually help you with hints and if they have encountered a certain monster before they also give hints. Pawns can be a blessing or a freking annoyance depending on their behaviour though so learn them to stay away from Guardian/Nexus as it keeps them close to you and not our there killing monsters.\n\nTL;DR\nFun adventure/fantasy/action game.

I read that the only notable difference to the combat is that almost everything can one shot you in the early game which is true and while I did enjoy mastering it,it was a little frustrating at times. You do lvl up twice as fast and later it becomes a little less of an issue though so its not all that bad imo. My suggestion is to not start in hard like I did. From my understanding it was designed originally for new game+ and im sure you'll have a much better time playing normal. I'm an exception as I really enjoy challenging games and barely if ever start in normal xP Just wish it did more than just change dmg values.\n\n\nSkillsets-\nWhile not a con an extra skillslot or two per weapon wouldve been nice and added a bit more real time variety as apposed to having to go change them or your class at a certain location does.\n\n\nMenu-\nYou spend way too much time in menus, Even though the PC version enables you to bind "certain items" (another con) to the 1-5 keys I doubt many people play this with M+K. It plays well and all but the max fov I think is 75 so expect to get nasious if close to the screen. Luckily for me I use a Steam Controller and I had those keys binded, otherwise i would've really hated it initially. It does get better once you learn your way around though so.... Yeah.\n\n\nStory-\nThe little story it has is... Well just that, very little and doesn't exactly encourage you to keep playing the game for the sole intent of finishing the story alone. Hell I completed Bitterblack Isle first. which is alot harder and meant for endgame content, before the main quest so that's saying something. It doesnt help that the few Major cities (1) it has feels pretty morbid and depressing at times for its lack of open door environments and npc interaction being set at its bare minimum. Immersion evidently not being the a main focus of this game.\n\n\nEnvironment-\nWhile this game does feature some beautiful and open world environments you cant help but feel a certain emptiness when travelling along the same routes at times seeing as there is very little dynamic to it. The most obvious drawback being the spawns are always in the same locations with the same creatures and that can get pretty drab quickly if you like a bit of venturing as apposed to using fast traveling means alot. Making it very important that you place your ports in good locations and never too close because you only get a few, upside is that they're not permanent so u can move them around if you like. This method really would've worked better on a game like Skyrim with a lot more locations and overall dynamic feel. Anywhere, Anytime fast traveling is well... lets just say a love and hate thing xP\n\nItems-\nAn Insane amount of items!  This one is also a love & hate kind of thing. At times i loved just going in and finding at what ingredients I needed to create certain potions and which ones were well suited in terms of weight and all that, etc. I did memorize almost every recipe but bare in mind that it didn't come easy considering the huge amount of them. But jeez I think I spent about as much time if not more optimizing for weight, mixing and matching items, etc as I did playing the actual game. Like i said though I enjoyed it, its just that it had a bit too much of it maybe? Maybe...\n\nConclusion-\nIf you can get past these cons its a really enjoyable awesome game and a must buy at its price point.","April 1","true","160.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

A fun mix of all three, with the only downsides being a lack of variety in game assets. I feel I've only ventured about half the game world, maybe not even that but I've found you're either traversing forest/grassland, explorering oldschool dungeons or scouting castle grounds. Though this does give off a more realistic feeling to the environment whereas in dark souls, you may take a turn and the whole biome has changed in the blink of an eye.\nThe story sadly feels lacking and I have yet to feel immersed in the games world. A majority of the story quests are unrelated to the main plot, but are still enjoyable. I recommend to strictly follow the story questline till about level 20. I found if I strayed too far with a side quest, I found myself outmatched/outleveled and confused where to advance. Still yet to finish it, but having a ball :D Originally only bought this game to fill in the time for Dark Souls 3's release, but I've found something much greater than just a time filler.","April 5","true","28.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think it is an aquired taste, but should definetly be played by those who are RPG and Fantasy game fans. You will highly appreciate this game. It has a very strong role-playing aspect to it, with 9 classes to choose from, all with unique skills and abilities, and all can be played with the same character, and be switched with ease when you visit the inn in the big city in the game. Therefore, giving lots of re-playability, along with New Game Plus once the main quest is complete. Though what pissies me off is that you can only have one character at a time. I want a warrior, mage, and thief character, but I have to make a new steam account and family share if I want to do that. Back tracking and VERY limited enemy variations are also a setback. Also, the world is no Witcher 3 or Skyrim, so don't expect a HUGE open world. The combat however, is fantastic and super fluid. It works great with both keyboard+mouse and a controller, whatever your preference may be. But, if you can get past the negatives, which are fairy limited, this game will be a fantastic experience. This is a Fantasy RPG at the core, and done very well. Also, super addictive.\n\nP.S. After the main quest, there are a lot more quests, some more dungeons, (and the DLC Bitterblack Isle) to complete and there are more enemy variations.\n\n8.5/10  One of my favourite Fantasy RPGs.","April 9","true","141.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They might tell you to kill skeletons, and will tell you what area, but not where the area is. Often you get kill quests that don't show up on the map because that's their way of saying that if you do some exploring, you'll run into them eventually.]. However, the story is pretty good, the fighting is fun as far as hack and slash goes, and there are many colorful characters.\n\nWhat really stands out about this game, is the pawn system. Party of 4, 2 of your creation [One is you, the other is your main helper] and 2 more that you can hire at specific stones that are essentially player-made characters. If that's not cool enough, the pawns actually learn about quests they are taken on, so very often you might hire a pawn who has knowledge of a quest you're trying to complete, and they will offer help with information. You also can gives presents to players whose pawns you thought went above and beyond the call of duty.

Admittedly, I have a short attention span. I love RPGs… I\nespecially love RPGs with good stories. Sometimes, an RPG can have a\ngreat story, but if the combat is dull and not fun or challenging, I\nwill lose interest. Look at my profile and see the games I’ve played.\nA lot of triple A RPGs in there with 20 hours or less.\n\nDragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen is a fabulous game and is very underrated.\nI consider it to be the best action RPG I have ever played, by far.\nSuch a fantastic balance of level design, story, fun combat and\ngameplay has never existed in my mind. Darksouls was great combat,\nterrible story. Skyrim (and all Elder Scrolls games, really) featured\na great story but boring combat. The closest I can come to describing\nthis game in terms of other games would be a combination of Monster\nHunter and Skyrim. Yes… it is that awesome. Please allow me to\nelaborate.\n\nLevel Design and presentation: Not the prettiest or flashiest when it\ncomes to modern PC games and all the bells and whistles, but the level\nand character design is second to none. Some moments are breathtaking.\nThe immersion is astounding and very overlooked in this title. Like\nonce when I was standing on a castle wall and looking out over the\nocean and noticing that the banners hanging on the castle walls were\nflapping in the breeze, I could actually hear them flapping as well as\nthe ocean waves crashing against the cliffside below. Now that is\nattention to detail.\n\nSpeaking of castles, the fortresses and castles in this game are\namazing. The level layouts and designs are what I would imagine a real\ncastle would be like. Gran Sorensen looks, sounds and feels like a\nreal medieval city. Yes, some textures look muddy and under-detailed\nby today’s standards, but this game absolutely makes you believe you\nare really there even with the last gen graphics. And it isn’t just\nthe cities. With few exceptions, the “over-world”, dungeons and city\nmaps are all amazingly well-made.\n\nOther than the occasional bland texture, the player characters, pawns\nand enemies all look great as well. There is such a great variety in\ngear that other than a few overused DLC armor set or two, you rarely\nsee pawns that look the same. At least, while leveling up to defeat\nthe game. I’m just now getting to post-game so that may change, but\nI’ve been amazed by the variety in pawn looks.  More than once I\nstopped running around long enough to inspect a pawn to see what that\nawesome looking helmet or other piece of armor they were wearing was.\n\nThe animations are all outstanding with even the most minor of enemies\nhaving large and varied sets of behavior and animations. I almost fell\nout of my chair the first time a goblin came running over the hill,\nnearly running right into me. He skidded to a stop and fell on his\nrear end, just as surprised and shocked as I was. I almost felt guilty\nfor rapidly dispatching him before he could call for help (yes… they\ndo that too). I’ve seen many little touches like this that served to\nimmerse me like few games ever have. Visually and musically, this game\nis a work of art. Even the voice acting is surprisingly good for a\nlocalized Japanese game. And the music is fabulous, of course, but if\nyou’ve been reading about it, you probably already know that.\n\nStory: I’m not sure why so many people sell the story is this game\nshort. It is actually a really good story with many interesting and\nvaried subplots. It is very easy to get lost on a sub quest and forget\nthat you aren’t actually getting anything done for the main quest. I\nfound myself caring for the plights of some of the characters and I\nWANTED to help them… and not just for their rewards. I suspect a lot\nof people really didn’t pay much attention and just wanted a good\naction RPG.\n\nCombat and Character Building: Another fantastic part of this game is\nit’s combat systems. So many different options and ALL of them fun and\nrewarding. I liked Skyrim, but without its story, it would be a very\ndull game. This game is the exact opposite. Great combat that just\nflows and feels right. I played this game on a console as well, but\nthe 60 frames per second on the PC REALLY makes a difference.  Adding\nto the fluid and exciting combat system is the DEEP character building\nsystem underneath. With 9 vocations (think classes) and hundreds of\nskills and augments,  non-penalized class mixing-and-matching (though\nyour first 10 levels has a bigger effect on your stats than the next\n90 levels will, which then have a bigger effect than the final 100\nlevels do for a total maximum level of 200), you really can try to\ncraft a character build that perfectly suits your play-style. For\nexample, my final assassin build uses augments from the fighter class,\nthe warrior class and the mage class. Assassins are a bit lacking in\nmagic defense, so I used just enough discipline points to invest in\nthe mage class to get its magic defense augment.  The Fighter and\nWarrior Augments add strength and a little physical defense thrown in\nfor good measure. I really do love the build system here. It feels\nlike you really are making the character your own without the\ndumbed-down system so many RPGs have these days. At the same time,\nsome parts were challenging but rarely felt unfair. I can think of one\ninstance near the beginning of the game when a group of bandits felt\nextremely overpowered and out of place… like the level design team\naccidently put them there, but other than that, it was a great\ngameplay experience from beginning to end.\n\nFinal Verdict: If you like engrossing action RPGS, then you MUST get\nthis game. It is phenomenal. Any sequels will be a must-buy for me.","February 14","true","98.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rinhawkwing/recommended/367500/","rinhawkwing","Rin.Hawkwing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rinhawkwing/","52 products in account","TL;DR version: God of War and Monster Hunter had a baby called Dragon's Dogma.\n\n\n\nIn depth version:\nThis is one of those GOTY style ports of older PS2/3 games to PC being distributed via Steam lately. That means this comes with every single DLC it originally had - no need to purchase anything. A price tag of 30 bucks might seem a hefty price tag for a port, but I can assure you it's worth it. I certainly don't regret grabbing it. Hell, I was waiting on a Steam sale for it initially but having aquired the game by other means, I picked it up the very next day when I realised what a gem it is.\n\nStoryline-wise it's pretty basic across the board, even for the expansion area; Bitterblack Isle. It's a game that sells more off the gameplay, not the storyline - much like Dark Souls. You play an ordinary fisherman whose village gets attacked by a dragon. Upon fighting back, it effortlessly knocks you away but recognizes your bravery and retreats - but not before ripping your heart out and cursing you to become an Arisen. It's now your fate to confront the monster and kill it. As for Bitterblack Isle, the storyline is simply that a mysterious isle appeared off the coast of your hometown. You're off to explore the dark labyrinth and follow the footsteps of those other Arisen that came before you into the same trap. You're free to escape anytime of course...but do you really not want to explore the depths and unravel the mystery of the labyrinth?\n\nSo the gameplay...it's as though God of War and Monster Hunter had a baby called Dragon's Dogma which grew up playing Dark Souls but realised such a hardcore game wouldn't sell well in today's market. As a result it takes pieces of all these games and throws them together. You have your standard hack and slash styling like Monster Hunter and the monsters drop materials which may be combined into other items (potions, etc) or used in enhancing your gear. Don't worry though, Monster Hunter's carving system isn't present in this game. Neither is the massive weapon upgrade pathing that made the series unique - take that how you will, I considered it a con. Against larger monsters like chimeras, 15ft tall cyclops and the like, you can jump onto them and gouge them to death like a God of War. Or monsters like wolves might drag you to the ground and start mass mauling you as a pack, triggering quicktime events like God of War where you shake your joystick till you're free - or dead. There's a multitude of skills one can acquire (though 3 per weapon equipped is the limit - mages get 6 for their staves) ranging from counter and riposte skills to dropping meteors on the field. Some skills are class or weapon restricted for the sake of balance. Aspects of the game (Bitterblack Isle) are also highly challenging initially (emphasis on 'initially') where, like Dark Souls, one mistake can result in a oneshot. Bitterblack Isle however is completely optional and in no way impacts on the main story, allowing...*ahem* less...brave gamers to avoid it entirely.\n\nThe Pawn system in Dragon's Dogma is also something of note. Pawns are AI controlled followers that form a party of up to 4 (you and 3 pawns) or you can solo play. You have a 'main pawn' which you get to customize very early on (literally first 10 mins of play) and 2 'support pawns' which are optional. The pawns learn as the game goes on, gaining knowledge about quests, locations and monsters. Seems useless, right? That's where the online features come in. You can recruit the pawns of other players as support pawns and upload your own pawn to be hired by other players. So your pawn might come back with knowledge of a foe you haven't faced before and shout out tips in a fight accordingly. Or they might have knowledge of your quest targets and guide you to the location or give you hints in the right direction.\n\nSo in summary...\nPros:\n+ Excellent gameplay, decently balanced. Gamers may challenge themselves by utilizing the basic starter weapons while max leveled as well as no armor, as made a habit by many Monster Hunter masoc-...veterans like myself who get a kick out of being oneshot from a single mistake or having two or three hour battles with a single monster. Or they may forgo this entirely while still being kept moderately challenged the entire game through.\n+ No bugs. Seems they squashed the lot when porting to PC.\n+ Good music. Battle vs Daimon's first and second forms in particular stand out in memory.\n+ Sensible hitboxes, unlike Monster Hunter. I'm looking at you, Rathian/Rathalos tail swipes.\n+ Pawn system is unique.\n\nCons:\n- 'Blender game'. A game that took aspects out of several smash hits and threw them into one game. Lacks the major depth of those games. Can be a pro if you're a filt-...casual gamer.\n- Climbing camera can annoy you very quickly, especially when the monster jiggles a lot trying to throw you off. You'll end up climbing in the wrong direction a LOT. Could've been better done (ie climb controls relative to the player character, not the camera).\n- Pawns learn on a "Do as I do" basis, not a "Do as I say" basis. So you'll see magic using pawns climbing on monsters sometimes. Can be remedied via ingame items to manipulate their AI behaviour, but gets tedious sometimes and requires rechecking of their AI or quashing of some aspects entirely.\n- Due to pawn AI system being somewhat unclear, you'll see a lot of uploaded pawns with Scather behaviour (targets strongest foes first). This would be fine, except the Scather behaviour prefers MELEE over ranged. But due to the misleading description, you'll find a huge amount of Strider/Ranger/Mage/Sorcerer pawns with that stupid behavior. Guardian is another one (stays near the Arisen) that is common and bad as it is a passive AI (very rare attacks).\n- Pawn AI system isn't the only thing with unclear descriptions. A number of augments (extra abilities you can equip - up to 6 at a time) have misleading or outright incorrect descriptions.\n\nYou decide:\n-+ Minimalistic storyline. Not as minimalistic as Dark Souls, but clearly designed to sell on gameplay, not story.\n-+ $30 price tag. Pricy for a port I suppose, but I consider it worth it.\n-+ Save system is a love-hate relationship. Old fashioned one save, checkpoint style. Good for anti save-scuming (where people would repeatedly reload to influence the RNG) to an extent (negated by Godsbaning...) but terribly annoying for those that like to mantain multiple characters. Will especially annoy people that like continuous restarting for that challenging struggle at the beginning of a game because you MUST play the bloody prologue repeatedly.\n-+ About half the game is somewhere between Monster Hunter and Dark Souls level difficulty. People looking to be a completionist but lousy at gaming may get horribly upset with Bitterblack Isle as a result. In particular, the necrophagus spawns tend to wreck the unprepared intially.\n-+ Short as heck storyline for the main vanilla storyline. Speed run videos have popped up with people zipping through in 13mins or so. Again, designed to sell on the gameplay, but some people may be upset by this.\n-+ Don't worry, this isn't Dark Souls. No players randomly popping to your world to camp you. Course, that applies both ways...\n\nPS: Feel free to friend me to make use of my pawn. Higher levelled pawns usually cost ingame currency to hire, but friends can get carried by friends' pawns for free. Bear in mind my pawn is usually a pure healer/support and has literally no attack skills beyond the basics. I also restart from time to time for that challenge, so my lvl 200 sorcerer dropping meteors/summoning glaciers to skewer enemies/being a badass in general might suddenly be replaced by a lvl 20 ranger. If you really need the carry, send me a message and I'll restore a previous save and upload my previous maxed pawn instead. Feel free to add class requests, but she's best as magic/ranged based.","February 17","true","256.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

While it lacks in a lot of areas (story, small-ish world map, simple crafting system) it makes up for in others (character customization, pawn learning, sharing, and feedback, and diverse, responsive, fun combat).\n\nIt's definitely not for everyone, and it plays a lot like an offline MMO in terms of sidequests and story. However, the game's excellent combat and pawn systems more than make up for it. You can beat the main game in probably 6-8 hours, maybe less if you're quick, but there's a lot of hidden depth and post-game content, and the ability to start New Game+ with all your gear and stats. Some even say Bitterblack Isle is the best part of the game, and how the entire game should feel like, which I would agree, and Bitterblack is mostly for players who have finished the game and want more, which means it's purely optional content.\n\nDragon's Dogma is a sad example of a game who was overly ambitious in development (the outer world is half as big as what was planned, for example, and several big features and locations didn't make it to the final game) and as a result, had a lot of it's ideas and features scrapped and released in a very rushed manner due to budget issues, go look at the art books online and you'll see some examples.\n\nOh, and the port is nigh-on perfect. Keyboard and mouse works excelently, and I haven't heard of anyone having trouble running the game at 60FPS, whilst constant 20~ framerate and lower was a massive, common problem on the console version.\n\nWho knows, if the game sells well, which it has so far, Capcom may be enticed into funding Dragon's Dogma 2, and this time, actually take their time and release a polished, finished game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kyuusensei/recommended/367500/","kyuusensei","Professor Q","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kyuusensei/","260 products in account","I guess after 80 hours I can say a few things about this game...\n\nIf you didn't know, Dark Arisen is the expansion for Dragon's Dogma that came out a year after its release. I never got around to playing the extra content before my PS3 decided to die, and since I lost my save game I figured I'd just wait - and the waiting paid off with the PC release. Starting over again meant I could enjoy the core game with a graphics upgrade and then finally move on to the mysterious Bitterblack Isle that I missed a couple of years ago thanks to Sony's shoddy video card soldering.\n\nTHE CORE GAME\n\nDragon's Dogma starts out with an enticing premise. You face off with a Dragon on your hometown's beach front, and after barely scratching its skin the Dragon enters a sort of trance and rips your heart from your chest - magically sealing your life to his as you walk the Earth as the immortal Arisen.\n\nThen... The game just kind of pitters around for about 20 hours.\n\nSomeone on the Gamefaqs forums once called this game "Devil May Skyrim of the Colossus." That's really the best way to describe it. The director of the original Devil May Cry games took battle system concepts from that series and applied them to semi-Bethesda style open world. I say "Semi" because it's not packed with the same kind of a hundred half-written mini stories that you'd find in Skyrim. There's only one major city - two civilized settlements in total - and only a handful of dungeons. What's there is very well thought out with top notch level design, but the biggest draw is the combat.\n\nDragon's Dogma isn't perfect, but it's interesting. If Dark Souls is the pinnacle of RPG Combat sitting at a 10, and if Devil May Cry was put on the same list with an 8 or 9, I'd put Dragon's Dogma at a 7 or an 8. While Dark Souls is more about positioning and timing, Dragon's Dogma is about weakpoints and how to address them. One of the selling points is your ability to grapple enemies and when it comes to the giant Cyclops or the titular Dragons that means climbing all over them - Shadow of the Colossus Style. Every single enemy is different and needs to be dealt with differently - and with 3 play-styles with variances between 9 different vocations (classes) you quickly learn the game's rock paper scissors advantages and disadvantages. Add in an ingenious party system consisting of a personalized pawn and any online pawns you can hire from other players and you end up with a system far deeper than any of its individual elements.\n\nAs mentioned it isn't perfect though. There's no camera control when you're climbing on things, and your greatest enemy quickly becomes the walls around you and its affect on your viewpoint. The direction you move is relative to your character's body - tank control style - making navigating the navel of the giants something akin to walking around with a mushroom on your head in Earthbound. Combat difficulty can simmer at too easy for a long time until you find an enemy capable of combo killing you in three shots. But the biggest offender I think is the potion system. The game lets you carry supplies at the expense of your own movement, but it's almost never bad enough that you aren't carrying around a pack full of cure-alls at any given time. Potions are accessed through the pause menu and heal you instantly - acting as a sort of "Reset" for combat gone awry. In the endgame you're even given an abundance wakestones that literally bring you back to life if you die - and you have enough carry weight that I was toting at least 5 of these everywhere I went. I often intentionally would die as a tactical decision.\n\nAt its best, the combat is deep and challenging, but even at its worst its certainly more fun than the cat-fight flailing you find in other open world RPGs.\n\nIronically though, my favorite thing about this game is the story. It has a great start, and it has a deep and thought provoking end. Your relationship with the Dragon Grigori by itself is interesting, but when you delve deeper into the reason for that relationship, the campy Capcom fluff becomes surprisingly philisophical. It's the kind of ending that definitely invites a love it or hate it reaction, but I'm firmly in the camp of "love it."\n\nThere are certain aspects of the lore that I think are throw away though. The development of the nature of the pawns for instance is pretty nonsensical and meaningless. Unfortunately, that's kind of the focus of Dark Arisen...\n\nTHE DARK ARISEN CONTENT\nWhile the main game touches on some of my favorite aspects of Eastern religion and ideas, in Bitterblack isle you're met with generic tripe. The island does give you a lot of excuse to play around with the game's combat, much more so than what was available in the original game. If you've ever wondered if your character was strong enough or your skill was good enough to take on 3 Dragons and 10 Minotaur at once, you'll get your opportunity and then some in this insane "Ultima Weapon" style add-on.\n\nThe payoff is a pretty fun boss and a stupid ending. It can basically be summarized as "An arisen goes emo and becomes TEH DEVIL and tries to destroy the world." I don't consider this a spoiler, because the title "Dark Arisen" alluded to that from the beginning. What's disappointing about it is that there was no twist, just an expounding of existing lore. It's not the worst thing ever, it's just too expected from a game that in my opinion broke into something new and interesting with its core game story arc.\n\nAnd, to make matters worse, the randomness of gear hunting hits MMO levels with no particular reason behind it. I haven't seen this much insanity for equipment upgrades in a single player game since Kingdom Hearts, and that isn't high praise. It saddens me that with such great level design they felt the need to stoop to such a copout for artificial extension.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nPlaying Dark Arisen makes me reinforces to me that Dragon's Dogma in its original state was probably just a happy accident, and I doubt that Capcom can ever duplicate or surpass it with any new iteration to the franchise. I give the core game my whole-hearted recommendation with a score of a 4 out of 5 - barely inching its way into that category with the surprises it offers.  The Dark Arisen content is a fun Dungeon Crawl, but its not much else. If I were to judge it by itself, it'd receive a 3 out of 5 with a "Recommended, but skippable" merit. I for one think the core game is worth the $30 asking price by itself, but I'd guess it's going to hit $10 by the end of February next year, I wouldn't blame you if you waited until then.\n\nIt would be nice if this game's combat was used in combination with a more epic scope, or better presentation in writing, but sadly it seems the gaming industry likes to keep tight gameplay and open worlds separated for some reason.\n\nI was going to make my pawn an awesome level 200 Fighter monster that friends could summon, but I feel pretty satisfied having completed the content that I have. Maybe I'll boot it up again and tackle hard mode somewhere down the line and top my characters off.","February 16","true","84.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TacticalTruth/recommended/367500/","TacticalTruth","TacticalTruth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TacticalTruth/","184 products in account","Dragon’s Dogma: Take up arms, Arisen\n\nDragon’s Dogma is a weird game. Like, in the good way-- it’s definitely good weird. What makes it weird? Well, Dragon’s Dogma has excellent combat, interesting monster design, an open world, and a steep difficulty curve. But it’s also heavily Japanese. If that doesn’t mean anything to you well... It’s like Monster Hunter meets Dark Souls, with a dash of Skyrim. Two great games, and a pretty good one. Which game I am referring to, you decide.\n\nNow, don’t get me wrong I love this game. I played it back on the Xbox 360, and recently bought it again to replay it! Capcom decided to re-release it on the Steam, and when I heard this I actually yelled in excitement. “‘BOUT TIME!”. I don’t usually do that, but in this case I was pretty stoked. Dragon’s Dogma was an exceptional game back on the Xbox, but it was hamstrung by bad performance and A LOT of screen tearing. I never really noticed screen tearing… Until I played Dragon’s Dogma… It was bad, but bearable, and worth it.\n\nNow that Capcom has released the game on PC it has none of those limitations and it truly shines because of it. After playing about twenty or so hours of the game on PC I went back and checked it out on the XBox. The only way I could describe it-- is: Gross. It felt so sluggish. Everything about it was slow, and framey... I’m not usually a stickler about this kind of stuff… But the difference was night and day. It was not the game I remembered.\n\nAnyway, I won’t go on about technical issues much, but suffice it to say: The game runs like a dream compared to the Xbox, and it also looks significantly better too, which is nice.\n\nThis is a great port, of a great game-- and it runs like it should. Well.\n\nNow on to the game proper! Dragon’s Dogma game is definitely Japanese. I mean it was released by Capcom. And you can feel the Japanese-ness in every fiber of the game. Do game’s have fibers? Anyway… Dragon’s Dogma is an Eastern take on a Western open world RPG. Ala Skyrim. And it does a very respectable job! But it’s definitely niche. I won’t lie to you and tell you this game is for everyone. Because it isn’t… But I would advise you to give it a chance.\n\nSo for the game’s sake, I’ll ask you a few questions:\n\nDo you like fighting giant monsters? Do you like challenging boss fights? Do you like Shadow of the Colossus? Do you like having to fight tooth and nail to succeed? Seemingly accurate medieval dialog? Dragons? Magic? Monster Hunter? Fake British accents? Kimyōna Nihon no mono?\n\nIf you said hai to three of those questions-- well, then do I (probably) have the game for you!\n\nLet’s talk about the combat first, because that’s definitely the main draw of this game-- unless you’re really into the weird romance side of things… Anyway… The combat is great, but it’s definitely different. You have a standard light and a heavy attack, as well as up to six different skills for each of the game’s nine classes. Yes nine.\n\nThe combat is rather simple with only a few different combos, but the variety of skills and multitude of ways to use them comes together in a very pleasant and rewarding way. Also the magic system is one of the coolest I’ve seen in a video game. Right up there with Magicka. I’ve been mentioning Magicka a lot… Maybe I should play it again.\n\nNow it might sound intimidating that Dragon’s Dogma sports nine different classes, but it’s actually handled quite well. The game splits it’s classes, called vocations, into three types: Basic, Advanced, and Hybrid. And they sound exactly like what you would expect.\n\nBasic vocations are your standard RPG fare: sword and board Fighter, bow and dagger Strider, and the hurt or heal Mage. Advanced Vocations are specialized versions of their basic cousins: Warrior, Ranger, Sorcerer. And of course the Hybrid vocations are… well-- Hybrids. Featuring the Assassin, Magic Archer, and the Mystic Knight.\n\nAlthough there is some overlap, each vocation has a large amount of unique abilities which is where they really flesh out from each other and feel different. On top of that each vocation also has a variety of class independent ‘Augments’ which provide various boons, and are unlocked as you rank up in each vocation. So play around with the vocations and see which ones you like! I really enjoy the Ranger and Mystic Knight. This game has a huge potential for Min/Maxing as well.\n\n\nIn addition to yourself-- The Arisen, you also get a companion called a pawn. And you can also hire two additional pawns to create a party of four. And trust me party composition is quite important. If you don’t have a healer/buffer… You’re Chimera food...\n\nSpeaking of Chimeras, you face some truly difficult and abhorrent creatures in the world of Gransys. You will encounter, Cyclopes, Hydras, Wights, Wargs, Gryphons, Cockatrices, and of course Dragons! And plenty of others too!\n\nThe encounters with these creatures are almost always memorable. Without fail something unexpected will happen and it will leave an impression on you-- or a deep emotional scar that will may never heal... I still remember the time my entire party was stricken with petrification and we slowly turned to stone with no hope of escape. Watching you and your party slowly harden into twisted statues and then crumble into dust is hard to forget. Trust me the monster encounters are super cool, and almost always heart pounding.\n\nAlso the fight with the Dragon is one of the coolest boss fights I have experienced in gaming. It does everything right. And despite really wanting to tell you about it, I would suggest you go in blind.\n\nIt’s so badass, though. Like if you don’t have any interest in this game atleast check it out on YouTube.\n\nLike this review?

Combat is smooth, varied, and very visceral sounding and feeling.  The mechanics for moving around in the world are very responsive, and the character leveling system is forgiving of mistakes, easy to get into, and impressively versatile.\n\nIn addition, the PC port is gorgeous looking (obviously still somewhat limited by it's overall graphical limits) and runs liquid smooth.\n\nThe primary plot is fairly straightforward, and role-playing aspects are extremely limited.

It took me awhile to go from "all this walking back and forth between towns is really boring and tedious" to "Ok now that I can teleport the game is a lot easier to bare. I guess that's partially my fault cause I was doing the side quests instead of the main quest, but still I wish fast travel was available from the start.\n\nThe game has some really cool ideas with the Pawns. There's such a wide variety of characters to choose from so you can pretty easily find the right team for your playstyle. And that is really important to me.\n\nWhen playing RPG's I tend to play a Ranger class. I like using the bow as my weapon of choice. Typically games aren't built for having the main character play a class that is mainly used as support. So indulging my Ranger needs would prove very difficult.  However, because of the different Classes that DD provides I was able to form the character I wanted, and have the perfect team to play off of. It's very rare for a game to do this and it felt really good to be able to actually play the way I want without compromising my style. It's the first time since playing Dragon Age that I felt that freedom.\n\nNow the game isn't without fault. As I said the beginning of the game can be fairly tedious to play, I actually stopped playing for awhile because I got bored of running back and forth. It just takes so long to go from point A to point B while fighting to help Lvl up.\n\nThe game also had some mechanics issues for me, While the Pawns you get are pretty good, there's not real way to have a strategy. They just do whatever they want and fight whoever they want. This can get rather bothersome in bigger fights when they just charge at the enemy instead of playing defensively to allow the mage to pick off the slow moving creature. This part of the game just felt lacking, especially when fighting bosses where it mattered who did what.\n\nDD has a really cool climbing mechanic for the larger bad guys similar to Shadow of the Colossus. While it add a cool new fighting style, it was very difficult to navigate when on a bad guy. I would often push up thinking my character would climb towards its head, but it often went a different way. It was hard to get my bearings especially when I was upside down. This pretty much caused me to abandon all hopes of utilizing this mechanic.\n\nThe story for the game, I felt, was kinda weak. There's not much of an explanation as to why you were chosen as the Arisen, or what the point of it all really was. The dragon chooses you to attempt to be his undoing, why? Idk I didn't really see a reason as to why the Dragon would even want to put himself in that position, but whatever. It just seemed all rather random in an attempt to make a story.\n\nBut overall the game was fun. It did some things I've not seen accomplished in other RPGs, and I look forward to the hopes of a sequel to get a more rounded experience","February 16","true","35.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The music is horrible. The cutscenes are especially horrible. The UI isn't changed from the console release (read: horrible).\n\nBut the combat is rather fun. There's just one big problem I've found with the early game, or perhaps it's just with the storyline in general. It's that there's so much slogging through boring content to get to the good parts. Fighting big monsters is really fun, but doing quests and killing bandits and goblins and other small critters is completely boring.\n\nOften you'll find yourself running through large expanses of land to get to a quest objective, and there's nothing along the way but bandits barely worth killing. This is pretty much what questing is like. 15 minutes of running to get to 5 minutes of actual fun.\n\nThis is an RPG only in the sense that you're given the mechanics and tools to role-play, but you have to completely make up your own canon. There's practically no story to facilitate role-playing. If you're looking for an RPG, this probably isn't a good choice. On the other hand, if you're just about the action, then perhaps you'll find value in Dragon's Dogma. Just be prepared to slog through the first bit to get to the good parts.\n\nThere are really awkward keybindings, such as backspace to confirm changes (really?). The menus have a lot of unnecessary pauses, such has a 2 second modal dialogue saying "Game is saved". Saving options takes nearly 10 seconds (how?). The game syncs with a server whenever you sleep at an inn, and it takes another 10 seconds. The menus are extremely console-ish with its giant fonts, overuse of icons, and lists containing only three elements at a time. Performance is great however, as it should be for a game of such fidelity.\n\nGenerally I'm having fun with it though. I'd recommend it, but I also recommend that you do much more research into this game than you normally would. There are a lot of reviews looking at it through rose-tinted 2012 glasses, so beware and be more discerning about their opinions.","February 15","true","17.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

Better late than never.\n\nNow that the game has been freed from the confines of old consoles it is great to finally be able to enjoy the gameplay at a stable 60+ fps, instead of the terrible framerate I played with on the PS3.\n\nThe game was never a looker, but the overall world aesthetic is cohesive and pleasing. Monsters look great and everything is very well animated. I am thoroughly enjoying battling huge monsters all over again.\n\nThe port is barebones with no real enhancements to speak of but it's stable and offers seamless switching between mouse/keyboard and controller. Even with no additional enhancements the port does tick the boxes for a good PC port in terms of controls, resolutions and framerates up to 150 fps.\n\nThe meat of the game is the combat and the unique pawn rental system. The story is slow to begin with and perhaps not to everyone's liking, but I think it goes interesting places in the end. The real Dragon's Dogma starts with the post-game anyway. I'm not spoiling it here, but the end of the story is really just the beginning of the best part of the game - and then there's the high level Dark Arisen content with hours and hours of the best gameplay Dragon's Dogma has to offer.\n\nThis is easily one of the very best action RPGs ever created.","January 23","true","36.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Quite a number of points to cover now so it might be a wee bit of a read. I'll start with the character creation.\n\nCharacter Creation is a right bit impressive, your character (The Arisen) and your main Pawn (Your perma companion/slave/meat sheild/whatever) can be created up and customised when you get to do so. You can choose a good number of hairstyles and other cosmetics, however you'll need to notice the Height and Weight options that change during creation as they can impact gameplay, I havn't looked too much into this but I would imagine that lighter, smaller characters can sprint longer and quicker then bigger characters, but would likely not be able to carry as much.\n\nGameplay is like your hack n' slash if you go melee on the enemies (more on enemies later) and mage characteres have quite the magic system. I'm not playing as a mage myself but from what I've seen from my main pawn (Aimee) she has quite the magic power. You can also climb bigger enemies and hack away at their body parts if you want to butcher them for the banter. Want to cut the snake part off a Chimera? Go for it! You can throw your pawns and enemies off cliffs aswell if you want for easy kills, so if you want to create a pawn that looks like that annoying kid named Samuel Edmund that barely anyone likes for the sole purpose of throwing him off a cliff, go for it!\n\nThere is indeed online funcionality, however (I might be wrong, only got to the main city at the time of writing this) there isn't any PvP. You CAN however hire other player's pawns to fight for you. They'll use their abilities and destroy stuff if you need 'em to. If you want, you can find my pawn Aimee and hire her to fight for you if you want. I'll try getting that sorted.\n\nThe game has a good number of enemies. It has your standard RPG blokes like the goblins and zombies, but it has bigger enemies such as ogres and hydra enemies for a bigger challenge. Each type of enemy has weaknesses and such, so be sure to prepare quite well if you want to fight 'em.\n\nThe actual in-game enviroment is pretty big. Mind you, I'm only currently at the big city place but I imagine there is a whole lot more other places to explore, including caves, mines and other locations. Top looting kek.\n\nI would highly recommend this game for the RPG fans and if you fancy throwing people of cliffs. I'll give it a solid 9/10.\nThe price SHOULD be affordable enough for the amount of fun and gameplay that it offers, but if you don't have the money or still not sure about the game, you could wait for a sale or something.\n\n","January 23","true","58.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you have not played it before however, you should know what you're getting into. Dragons Dogma is an open world RPG, where you get to explore many fairly similar yet minutely distinct environments. The combat is very varied between the 9 vocations available, the games version of classes, which are almost freely switchable between, Whether you're melee or ranged, you have both physical and magical options which are both mechanically and visually distinct, with magic oft being the more visually spectacular, but not necesarilly satisfying option. The world itself has a lot of lore built into it, though it is hardly something pressed to the forefront; in general plot points beyond the major ones are kept relatively quiet. That said, the game does give a lot more if one explores at the right times, the right times being before a quest expires, as the game does make a fair few side quests, and even a few main ones, missable.

It's without a doubt a surprisingly fantastic RPG. For the sake of keeping things short, Dark Arisen 2016 is everything you've probably already played, only better. It's a great port, and at this price you have absolutely no excuse not to buy it right now.\n\nFor those who want a more detailed review, read on.\n\nPROS:\n-Say goodbye to silky smooth console 24fps.\nThe game runs at a constant (or variable, if you want) 60fps. If you are like me and often wished the console version ran at a higher frame rate, it's here, and it's wonderful.\n\n-At 1080p this game still looks good, and given the fact that it's a port of a 4 year old game I'm impressed. Some standard features like FOV adjustments and other graphical features can all be tinkered with as well.\n\n-You can play with Mouse and Key, and controller support is there as expected. My XB1 controller works fine.\n\n-Gameplay is just as fun as always. Monster Hunter with a dash of Dark Souls is how I usually describe it.\n\n-Explore, explore, explore. You never know what you're going to find.\n\n-"Boss" battles really do have a (again) Monster Hunter feel to them.\nClimb up the back, slash at the legs to topple it, it's up to you. It's not crushingly difficult, but you'll be in for a challenge.\n\n-The pawn system allows you to recruit other players pawns to join you on your quest. I personally love this feature as it allows me to hire higher level pawns, making my life that much easier.\n\n-A pleasant soundtrack, albeit a little repetitive over time.\n\nMIXED:\n-The story starts off half decent, slows down midway and then gets good near the end.\nNow for some the story won't really impact the level of enjoyment they get out of this game, while others might be slightly disapointed. It's not fantastic, but it's not bad either.\n\n\nNEGS:\n-MASTERWORKS ALL YOU CAN'T GO WRONG (repetitive NPC lines become a little annoying after a while, especially with pawns). Thankfully you can turn off your Pawns chatter completely. Shame the same can't be said for a certain shop owner.\n\n-Voice acting is a mixed bag. While I liked some characters, others were done poorly. Worse is that they've recycled the same VA for the pawns and raised or lowered their voices to give a half-baked impression that they're entirely different. I know it's due to budget/time/game restraints, but still.\n\n-Pawn AI seems to do alright half the time, other times they become a nuisance. For example, in one of the early quests you're forced to make a run for the exit. You make a break for the stairs and instead of following, the AI decides it's going to fight every single enemy AI on the way up. You have to either nanny them all the way (at the risk of your own life) or let them "die", hopefully reviving them at the next area.\n\n-A very minor gripe, but sometimes the game can become a touch grindy and it'll become clear to you that some bosses simply require a higher level character to take on. While it's hardly the end of the world, it might become frustrating when your quests end up stonewalling you and no amount of gitgud will save you.\n\n-No Berserk armour sets available to us dirty western piggus. Guts is finally off the boat and yet I still can't play as him.","January 16","true","27.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

Haven't tried 4k on my TV, but will soon. From what I can tell no online co op. If they add multiplayer I will buy more copies of the game so they're is an instenive for adding multiplayer. Very happy with my purchase.\n\nUpdate, 4k 60 FPS on GTX 970, cpu usage around 50%, GPU sits around 70-80%, but jumps up to 99%. I bit more taxing then Dark Souls 2. VRAM uses well under 3 GB at 4k. Biggest isse is the game seems to suffer from texture popping. The only hardware that could be causing this is my hard drive, 7200 RPM. I could try installing on my SSD to see if that fixes the issue. Otherwise it's just the game. Don't really use SSD for games.\n\nThe game itself just keeps getting better and better. It's basically Skyrim meets Dark Souls. Skyrim still has more detail and Dark Souls still has more precise combat. But the combat has a really enjoyable organic feel to it. The large bosses and the ability to climb on to them is fantastic. From what I can tell the map to this game is smaller then say Skyrim and The Witcher 3, but somehow it feels larger. This has a mix to do with the difficulty of combat, the fast travel system and day and night cycle. Combat is challenging, but not Dark Souls challenging. Leveing up, gearing up will cushion the challenge.\n\nYou can use an item you get from your Gran Soren depository to fast travel to a few major hubs and you must find each individually before fast travel options becomes available. This fast travel system will force you into having to travel through the same area's over and over, but in a quality way.  Basically fast travel is for returning to town, sell, gear up and then had back out. This makes fast travel not feel cheap and over used like in Skyrim, nor tedious like the original Dark Souls before completing Anor Londo.\n\nDay and Night is amazing, about 48 minutes total. Sun rises and sets at a very slow and realistic pace. Night is amazing, without Lantern areas can become pitch black. The Lantern is perfect, Dark Souls take note. You stick Lantern on your hip, has no impact on combat and use oil found around the game to fill it up. The environment is harsher and filled with more monsters at night. At night the game really starts to feel like my favorite manga Berserk. You feel very much like Guts being marked as sacrifice and that all ceatures of darkness are attracted to you.\n\nThe game features a Guts like class and Large swords. Of course many other options, basics are fighter, rogue, mage.  Biggest issue with combat is they're is no lock-on like Dark Souls, but I here Bow and Magic have lock-on, I wouldn't know. I really like the character editor, not overally detailed or simplistic. You can make migget or gaint, skinny or fat, muscular or not.\n\nFew last minutes note's, game features a pawn system, companions that travel with you. This is the online feature in the game. It allows us to all share are pawns with each other. Not much to say about it, works good and you can see for yourself what it's like.  Has plenty of Berserk references, earily on you meet a female commander much like Casca, later on you come to a witch house much like the one in Berserk. The game is fully voiced, but can't ride horses. Lastly I'm 80% sure this will be one of favorite games of all-time. Which makes me a little depressed by thinking to myself that I maybe missing out on great titles from Playstation and Nintendo consoles, but the Japanese seem to be catching on to the future of gaming which is to game one whatever the hell you want.","January 15","true","48.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","2"

Great character customization in terms of character creation, equipment variety, the ability to switch between classes freely, and choosing skills and augments. Combat is solid and the grab mechanic is great, but the game could use more variation in monster types to populate its large map. Quicktravel exists and I like that you have to work for it, and that you can place quicktravel points where you want them. The main story is simple and honestly kind of weak, but I absolutely love the subtle worldbuilding behind it all. The highlight is the battle with Grigori, where the game's story really unfolds, and it's probably my favorite dragon fight in any game.\n\nAlso the npc affinity system is a nice touch, especially since you can romance just about any npc however insignificant they may be (even on accident), but it would've been nice to see your partner do more than chill at your house. Same goes for the other character that goes to your house after completing her quest.\n\n\n10/10, would play a more polished sequel, on PC and/or PS4.","January 15","true","53.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

I put SO MUCH time into this game on PS3, it is one of my absolute favorite games of last gen, it's so freaking good! Even playing on my crappy laptop (not my main PC) it still runs at double the framerate as on console, so I'd say it's optimized pretty well! What can I say....\n-The story is awesome and stays interesting playthrough after playthrough\n-Endgame content is TOTALLY worthwhile and super fun to face harder challenges\n-The graphics, though obviously aged, still hold up really well (especially with maxed settings)\n-The leveling is FUN, you can level up an insane amount and it never feels grindy\n-The combat.... Ooohhh the combat.......... Simply put, it's probably my favorite combat in an RPG (only after Kingdom Hearts) It's deep, there's tons of different moves to learn, you can latch onto giant creatures ala Monster Hunter. It takes the best elements of MH, Dark Souls, and arcade hack n slash and just.... It's so fun..\n-Upgrade system and class system are very easy to switch, you can be anything you want to be anytime\n-Tons of customization for your character and pawn, loads of outfits/armors, once you start delving far into the game you can get black market items too, eventually when you level super high too (maybe this is a con for the diehards?) you don't even need to worry about what armor is "best" and can run around naked if you like (at least that's what I did when fighting UR dragon lol)\n-Bosses, bosses, bosses *drooling*\n-Interesting open world all throughout, lots of explorable treasures and awesome things/people/places to find\n\nTrust me, if you've never played this before, you NEED TO. It is a must own title for any RPG fan, any hack n slash fan, any Dark Souls, Elder Scrolls, Monster Hunter, even Final Fantasy fan. Realize this though: it IS a relatively aged game, so don't expect it to be the most beautiful new fresh perfect flawless 4K textured real life simulation type game.\n\nAnd be prepared to have this engraved into your head: THEY'RE MASTERWORKS ALL, YOU CAN'T GO WRONG","January 15","true","10.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has a day and night cycle system; in which the atmosphere in the game changes to a more survival horror vibe. The game has immense replay value as the are multiple side quests and the DLC to complete.\nWhen the game first released on consoles, I logged approximately 90 hours.\n\nIf you have not purchased or played the game before, this game is undoubtedly worth the full price.

The framerate isn't capped, or tied to the physics in any way - so you can play this game at over 60FPS and not suffer for it, and you'll more than likely be playing this game at over 60FPS thanks to the modest system requirements. An entry/mid range GPU will easily be able to hang with the higher settings.\n\nSo onto some pros and cons:\n\n+ Amazing combat, thnk Dark Souls meets Final Fantasy XII meets God of War meets Shadow of the Colossus, the big boss battles are truly memorable. The first time you tackle a Griffin or a Troll, you won't forget it. This game handles big monsters superbly, you don't just find yourself slashing at their shins a la Skyrim\n+ Big open world to explore with very few loading screens, and the ones that are there are very fast\n+ Robust character creation system and layered armour means you can create a truly unique character, a big plus for me in an RPG\n+ Pawn system is great and allows for some very unique party lineups, and sharing your pawns online and rating other people's is a lot of fun and adds a real sense of community in an otherwise single player game. Their AI is cgreat too, you only need to issue a few imple commands like 'help' and 'come' and they'll handle the rest.\n+ Not as many quests or dungeons as Skyrim or Dragon Age, but this is a game that values quality over quantity\n+ Open ended class sytem with lots of customization, and being able to switch between classes at the Gran Soren inn means you don't have to reroll another character in order to try something new.\n+ The Bitterblack Isle DLC which is included in Dark Arisen is a very fun and challening expansion that adds many more hours of looting, dungeons crawling and monster slaying\n\n- Big though the world is, the environment is very same old same old, steep crags, rivers, rolling hills, dried out shrubland and woods, that's more or less it.\n- Pawn chatter is annoying, luckily the PC port includes an option to disable it\n- The main story is very cliche, Dragon threatening the world, you are the chosen one, we've seen it all before. I never cared much for this game's story, but narrative isn't what drives this game, gameplay is.\n\n\nI give Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen an 8.5/10, arguably one of the best games to hit last gen consoles during the end of their tenure, now finally on the platform it deserved to be on in the first place.","January 19","true","14.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

After playing Dark Souls 2 for the last month and wanting to play Dark Souls 1 without terrible jittering and bad overall port performance, seeing a japanese developer do a PC port right is truly a breath of fresh air.\n\nThe textures are not beautiful. In fact, some of them seem damn atrocious. For example, in the subtitles, you can see the discoloration of pixels around lettering... But the game flows well. The higher framerate really helps make up for lesser textures by making the game feel responsive and smooth as far as game experiences go.\n\nThis game also does something that I've long desired in games. Too often game developers fall back on cinematics to do the big awesome stuff. You'll get into a fight of some sort, and when it is over it cuts to a neat scene of the character jumping up and doing some fantastic gymnastics to kill the enemy... In Dragon's Dogma though, it is a lot more like Shadow of the Colossus. There are mechanics for -you- to climb up on the enemy, to get up to his head and attack him from there. It isn't just you watching a cinematic of that being done, -you- do it. In that way, this game is already leagues ahead of so many action games that rely upon cinematics or QTEs for awesome character actions.\n\nAll around, this is a good game. I recommend it. My only true issue is just how many tutorials there are. I'm 2 hours in, and still getting assaulted with pop ups telling me about how to do different things. However, to be fair it is possible to turn those off... It just seems like by 2 hours in, I should be past the "tutorial" stage in the game.\n\nGet it.

Man I remember seeing reviews of this game a few years but it was console only and I hate consoles (PC=Masterrace) so I never thought I would play it.  Hearing buzz around the net on it so for $30 I thought sounded fair.\n\nNow the only gripe I have is the story seems a little light but meh.. The graphics are fine people.  I think it looks pretty solid.  Voice acting is fine too, I've heard worse.\n\nBut the gameplay, combat, pawns AI, enemy AI are the best I have ever played.  The Boss fights are truly Epic like others have said.  I'm barely into it and I am giddy how good it is.

Like, in the good way-- it’s definitely good weird. What makes it weird? Well, Dragon’s Dogma has excellent combat, interesting monster design, an open world, and a steep difficulty curve. But it’s also heavily Japanese. If that doesn’t mean anything to you well... It’s like Monster Hunter meets Dark Souls, with a dash of Skyrim. Two great games, and a pretty good one. Which game I am referring to, you decide.\n\nNow, don’t get me wrong I love this game. I played it back on the Xbox 360, and recently bought it again to replay it! Capcom decided to re-release it on the Steam, and when I heard this I actually yelled in excitement. “‘BOUT TIME!”. I don’t usually do that, but in this case I was pretty stoked. Dragon’s Dogma was an exceptional game back on the Xbox, but it was hamstrung by bad performance and A LOT of screen tearing. I never really noticed screen tearing… Until I played Dragon’s Dogma… It was bad, but bearable, and worth it.\n\nNow that Capcom has released the game on PC it has none of those limitations and it truly shines because of it. After playing about twenty or so hours of the game on PC I went back and checked it out on the XBox. The only way I could describe it-- is: Gross. It felt so sluggish. Everything about it was slow, and framey... I’m not usually a stickler about this kind of stuff… But the difference was night and day. It was not the game I remembered.\n\nAnyway, I won’t go on about technical issues much, but suffice it to say: The game runs like a dream compared to the Xbox, and it also looks significantly better too, which is nice.\n\nThis is a great port, of a great game-- and it runs like it should. Well.\n\nNow on to the game proper! Dragon’s Dogma game is definitely Japanese. I mean it was released by Capcom. And you can feel the Japanese-ness in every fiber of the game. Do game’s have fibers? Anyway… Dragon’s Dogma is an Eastern take on a Western open world RPG. Ala Skyrim. And it does a very respectable job! But it’s definitely niche. I won’t lie to you and tell you this game is for everyone. Because it isn’t… But I would advise you to give it a chance.\n\nSo for the game’s sake, I’ll ask you a few questions:\n\nDo you like fighting giant monsters? Do you like challenging boss fights? Do you like Shadow of the Colossus? Do you like having to fight tooth and nail to succeed? Seemingly accurate medieval dialog? Dragons? Magic? Monster Hunter? Fake British accents? Kimyōna Nihon no mono?\n\nIf you said hai to three of those questions-- well, then do I (probably) have the game for you!\n\nLet’s talk about the combat first, because that’s definitely the main draw of this game-- unless you’re really into the weird romance side of things… Anyway… The combat is great, but it’s definitely different. You have a standard light and a heavy attack, as well as up to six different skills for each of the game’s nine classes. Yes nine.\n\nThe combat is rather simple with only a few different combos, but the variety of skills and multitude of ways to use them comes together in a very pleasant and rewarding way. Also the magic system is one of the coolest I’ve seen in a video game. Right up there with Magicka. I’ve been mentioning Magicka a lot… Maybe I should play it again.\n\nNow it might sound intimidating that Dragon’s Dogma sports nine different classes, but it’s actually handled quite well. The game splits it’s classes, called vocations, into three types: Basic, Advanced, and Hybrid. And they sound exactly like what you would expect.\n\nBasic vocations are your standard RPG fare: sword and board Fighter, bow and dagger Strider, and the hurt or heal Mage. Advanced Vocations are specialized versions of their basic cousins: Warrior, Ranger, Sorcerer. And of course the Hybrid vocations are… well-- Hybrids. Featuring the Assassin, Magic Archer, and the Mystic Knight.\n\nAlthough there is some overlap, each vocation has a large amount of unique abilities which is where they really flesh out from each other and feel different. On top of that each vocation also has a variety of class independent ‘Augments’ which provide various boons, and are unlocked as you rank up in each vocation. So play around with the vocations and see which ones you like! I really enjoy the Ranger and Mystic Knight. This game has a huge potential for Min/Maxing as well.\n\n\nIn addition to yourself-- The Arisen, you also get a companion called a pawn. And you can also hire two additional pawns to create a party of four. And trust me party composition is quite important. If you don’t have a healer/buffer… You’re Chimera food...\n\nSpeaking of Chimeras, you face some truly difficult and abhorrent creatures in the world of Gransys. You will encounter, Cyclopes, Hydras, Wights, Wargs, Gryphons, Cockatrices, and of course Dragons! And plenty of others too!\n\nThe encounters with these creatures are almost always memorable. Without fail something unexpected will happen and it will leave an impression on you-- or a deep emotional scar that will may never heal... I still remember the time my entire party was stricken with petrification and we slowly turned to stone with no hope of escape. Watching you and your party slowly harden into twisted statues and then crumble into dust is hard to forget. Trust me the monster encounters are super cool, and almost always heart pounding.\n\nAlso the fight with the Dragon is one of the coolest boss fights I have experienced in gaming. It does everything right. And despite really wanting to tell you about it, I would suggest you go in blind.\n\nIt’s so badass, though. Like if you don’t have any interest in this game atleast check it out on YouTube.\n\nLike this review?

While it's not particularly ambitious (it doesn't have a grand arcing story, it's not a *huge* open world, and it isn't tremendously complex visually), the game just does what it does very well.  Combat is smooth, varied, and very visceral sounding and feeling.  The mechanics for moving around in the world are very responsive, and the character leveling system is forgiving of mistakes, easy to get into, and impressively versatile.\n\nIn addition, the PC port is gorgeous looking (obviously still somewhat limited by it's overall graphical limits) and runs liquid smooth.\n\nThe primary plot is fairly straightforward, and role-playing aspects are extremely limited.  The dialogue and voice-acting are not particularly imaginative, but competent.  But overall, the game is just a joy to play.  I love moving around in the world, the world looks...interesting in most of the places, the sound design provides excellent atmosphere, the fight mechanics are fun and active and diverse...\n\nI recommend this game to everyone that enjoys fantasy exploration and combat, and especially the PC port.","February 16","true","24.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

While it lacks in a lot of areas (story, small-ish world map, simple crafting system) it makes up for in others (character customization, pawn learning, sharing, and feedback, and diverse, responsive, fun combat).\n\nIt's definitely not for everyone, and it plays a lot like an offline MMO in terms of sidequests and story. However, the game's excellent combat and pawn systems more than make up for it. You can beat the main game in probably 6-8 hours, maybe less if you're quick, but there's a lot of hidden depth and post-game content, and the ability to start New Game+ with all your gear and stats. Some even say Bitterblack Isle is the best part of the game, and how the entire game should feel like, which I would agree, and Bitterblack is mostly for players who have finished the game and want more, which means it's purely optional content.\n\nDragon's Dogma is a sad example of a game who was overly ambitious in development (the outer world is half as big as what was planned, for example, and several big features and locations didn't make it to the final game) and as a result, had a lot of it's ideas and features scrapped and released in a very rushed manner due to budget issues, go look at the art books online and you'll see some examples.\n\nOh, and the port is nigh-on perfect. Keyboard and mouse works excelently, and I haven't heard of anyone having trouble running the game at 60FPS, whilst constant 20~ framerate and lower was a massive, common problem on the console version.\n\nWho knows, if the game sells well, which it has so far, Capcom may be enticed into funding Dragon's Dogma 2, and this time, actually take their time and release a polished, finished game. Who wouldn't want to see that?","February 20","true","114.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kyuusensei/recommended/367500/","kyuusensei","Professor Q","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kyuusensei/","260 products in account","I guess after 80 hours I can say a few things about this game...\n\nIf you didn't know, Dark Arisen is the expansion for Dragon's Dogma that came out a year after its release. I never got around to playing the extra content before my PS3 decided to die, and since I lost my save game I figured I'd just wait - and the waiting paid off with the PC release. Starting over again meant I could enjoy the core game with a graphics upgrade and then finally move on to the mysterious Bitterblack Isle that I missed a couple of years ago thanks to Sony's shoddy video card soldering.\n\nTHE CORE GAME\n\nDragon's Dogma starts out with an enticing premise. You face off with a Dragon on your hometown's beach front, and after barely scratching its skin the Dragon enters a sort of trance and rips your heart from your chest - magically sealing your life to his as you walk the Earth as the immortal Arisen.\n\nThen... The game just kind of pitters around for about 20 hours.\n\nSomeone on the Gamefaqs forums once called this game "Devil May Skyrim of the Colossus." That's really the best way to describe it. The director of the original Devil May Cry games took battle system concepts from that series and applied them to semi-Bethesda style open world. I say "Semi" because it's not packed with the same kind of a hundred half-written mini stories that you'd find in Skyrim. There's only one major city - two civilized settlements in total - and only a handful of dungeons. What's there is very well thought out with top notch level design, but the biggest draw is the combat.\n\nDragon's Dogma isn't perfect, but it's interesting. If Dark Souls is the pinnacle of RPG Combat sitting at a 10, and if Devil May Cry was put on the same list with an 8 or 9, I'd put Dragon's Dogma at a 7 or an 8. While Dark Souls is more about positioning and timing, Dragon's Dogma is about weakpoints and how to address them. One of the selling points is your ability to grapple enemies and when it comes to the giant Cyclops or the titular Dragons that means climbing all over them - Shadow of the Colossus Style. Every single enemy is different and needs to be dealt with differently - and with 3 play-styles with variances between 9 different vocations (classes) you quickly learn the game's rock paper scissors advantages and disadvantages. Add in an ingenious party system consisting of a personalized pawn and any online pawns you can hire from other players and you end up with a system far deeper than any of its individual elements.\n\nAs mentioned it isn't perfect though. There's no camera control when you're climbing on things, and your greatest enemy quickly becomes the walls around you and its affect on your viewpoint. The direction you move is relative to your character's body - tank control style - making navigating the navel of the giants something akin to walking around with a mushroom on your head in Earthbound. Combat difficulty can simmer at too easy for a long time until you find an enemy capable of combo killing you in three shots. But the biggest offender I think is the potion system. The game lets you carry supplies at the expense of your own movement, but it's almost never bad enough that you aren't carrying around a pack full of cure-alls at any given time. Potions are accessed through the pause menu and heal you instantly - acting as a sort of "Reset" for combat gone awry. In the endgame you're even given an abundance wakestones that literally bring you back to life if you die - and you have enough carry weight that I was toting at least 5 of these everywhere I went. I often intentionally would die as a tactical decision.\n\nAt its best, the combat is deep and challenging, but even at its worst its certainly more fun than the cat-fight flailing you find in other open world RPGs.\n\nIronically though, my favorite thing about this game is the story. It has a great start, and it has a deep and thought provoking end. Your relationship with the Dragon Grigori by itself is interesting, but when you delve deeper into the reason for that relationship, the campy Capcom fluff becomes surprisingly philisophical. It's the kind of ending that definitely invites a love it or hate it reaction, but I'm firmly in the camp of "love it."\n\nThere are certain aspects of the lore that I think are throw away though. The development of the nature of the pawns for instance is pretty nonsensical and meaningless. Unfortunately, that's kind of the focus of Dark Arisen...\n\nTHE DARK ARISEN CONTENT\nWhile the main game touches on some of my favorite aspects of Eastern religion and ideas, in Bitterblack isle you're met with generic tripe. The island does give you a lot of excuse to play around with the game's combat, much more so than what was available in the original game. If you've ever wondered if your character was strong enough or your skill was good enough to take on 3 Dragons and 10 Minotaur at once, you'll get your opportunity and then some in this insane "Ultima Weapon" style add-on.\n\nThe payoff is a pretty fun boss and a stupid ending. It can basically be summarized as "An arisen goes emo and becomes TEH DEVIL and tries to destroy the world." I don't consider this a spoiler, because the title "Dark Arisen" alluded to that from the beginning. What's disappointing about it is that there was no twist, just an expounding of existing lore. It's not the worst thing ever, it's just too expected from a game that in my opinion broke into something new and interesting with its core game story arc.\n\nAnd, to make matters worse, the randomness of gear hunting hits MMO levels with no particular reason behind it. I haven't seen this much insanity for equipment upgrades in a single player game since Kingdom Hearts, and that isn't high praise. It saddens me that with such great level design they felt the need to stoop to such a copout for artificial extension.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nPlaying Dark Arisen makes me reinforces to me that Dragon's Dogma in its original state was probably just a happy accident, and I doubt that Capcom can ever duplicate or surpass it with any new iteration to the franchise. I give the core game my whole-hearted recommendation with a score of a 4 out of 5 - barely inching its way into that category with the surprises it offers.  The Dark Arisen content is a fun Dungeon Crawl, but its not much else. If I were to judge it by itself, it'd receive a 3 out of 5 with a "Recommended, but skippable" merit. I for one think the core game is worth the $30 asking price by itself, but I'd guess it's going to hit $10 by the end of February next year, I wouldn't blame you if you waited until then.\n\nIt would be nice if this game's combat was used in combination with a more epic scope, or better presentation in writing, but sadly it seems the gaming industry likes to keep tight gameplay and open worlds separated for some reason.\n\nI was going to make my pawn an awesome level 200 Fighter monster that friends could summon, but I feel pretty satisfied having completed the content that I have. Maybe I'll boot it up again and tackle hard mode somewhere down the line and top my characters off.","February 16","true","84.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Whatever.  Point is, I bought the base version on the PS3 when it came out.  Then I bought the expansion.  Then I told my friends I'd buy it again if it came out on PC.  Years later, it came out on PC.  Bought ii again like I said I would.  Played the game multiple times through, again.  Very few games keep my attention long enough to play it multiple times, even with NG+ like this game has.\n\nThere's no RPG I would rather have.   Here's hoping we here in the west get either Dragon's Dogma Online, or Dragon's Dogma 2.  Both, preferably.  I'll buy it all.\n\nThis game has many flaws, but DD:DA does so many things right that I'm not even bothered by it.\n\nI feel like I should elaborate, but many other reviews have already done that for me.  The most important things the game has, in my opinion, is the character freedom, the replayability, and the combat.\n\nBy character freedom, I mean that the character customization is pretty good.  It's not Black Desert good, but this game lets you do things for characters that not even BDO will let you do.  Character height and weight has an impact on certain stats, though they're not really game-changing.  There's an item you can buy that lets you change (Entirely, even gender) your character and your main pawn from the main menu.  Later on you can buy one that's permanent.  This is extremely important for me.  Also, you can change your class and equipment at any time in town.  This is also very significant.\n\nReplayability is pretty self explanatory.  The game has some things that you might miss out on in your first playthrough, and NG+ is actually lore-friendly in this game.  I won't spoil it, but after you beat the game, it'll all make sense.  There are multiple endings, but only one lets you continue on with NG+, the 'true' ending, whatever that means.\n\nCombat.  The only thing I'll say about combat is, if it isn't fun, I wouldn't play a game through 7 times.  Being able to change classes in town is also a huge part of this.  You can literally switch your whole playstyle (including your party synergy) with a visit to a town.\n\ntl;dr - This game is worth the money.

Despite that, there was no denying the chunky framerate, the bland, washed out environments, and the general lack of visual pizzazz, due to console limitations.\n\nSince then, I've been pining for a next-gen sequel - or at the very least, a PC port. When this was announced, I just about lost my ♥♥♥♥: I had been waiting for that announcement for years. I couldn't have imagined what a stellar port it would turn out to be, though. Capcom has really stepped up their game here, and I couldn't be happier.\n\nNotable Port Features:\n\n- Customizable Keyboard and Gamepad controls\n- Lots of graphical bells and whistles to tweak, including an FOV slider (!)\n- Uncapped framerate (!), and stellar optimization (I am running this at 144hz/FPS on a 980ti, and it is a thing of beauty)\n\nOn the downside, there's no Japanese voice track, and the Berserk armor has been omitted - both due to licensing issues, which are admittedly out of Capcom's hands. But hey, it's not all bad - the English dialogue isn't terrible (for a change), and there are plenty of other badass gear sets to acquire. Plus, who knows - mods down the line, perhaps, this being on PC and all.\n\nAs for the game itself, if you've never played Dragon's Dogma, this is the time to do it. Sure, it might pale in comparison to something like the Witcher 3, but the game still stands strong thanks to its excellent combat system, which combines the ability to climb up on top of large foes and whack them to death (Shadow of Collossus style) with weighty, highly customizable action combat. The class system is awesome as well, allowing you to switch between classes on the fly once you've unlocked them, and even transfer some skills between classes.\n\nThe world is large (but not too large), incredibly fun to traverse (platforming ahoy!) and it is filled with quests to complete, monsters to slay, secrets to uncover, and treasure to plunder. It also has one of my favorite RPG aspects: content you can access early on, but can't complete until you're a total badass, later in the game. You haven't lived until you've returned at a higher level to hunt down that massive drake (who fried your lv. 3 ♥♥♥), climbed up its tail, and shanked it in the heart till it dropped, to finally collect your sweet, sweet rare loot.\n\nLoot is incredibly satisfying too, with badass gear strewn all around the world, and super rare pieces that can appear in specific chests, or on certain enemies, which you can come back to again and again until you get the lucky roll on that piece you've been wanting. So while the RNG aspect is there, it's also controlled - which is a pretty brilliant idea, in my eyes.\n\nOh, and did I mention the brilliant, innovative pawn system? You can create your own pawn (an AI companion that fights by your side throughout the game), and hire up to two others, created by other players across the world. It's an awesome, unique system (if an acquired taste). Best part is, it ties directly into the story.\n\nAnd as for story, Dragon's Dogma's is surprisingly deep, and philosophical - though it doesn't fully reveal its brilliance until you've finished the game. Hell, there's even a solid endgame waifu component.\n\nAgain, if you've been spoiled by the Witcher 3, you might look at this and turn up your nose. But understand that this is a port of a game that's several years old - and hot damn, is it a good port of a brilliant game at that.","January 15","true","7.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SurrealSage/recommended/367500/","SurrealSage","Surrialis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SurrealSage/","607 products in account","The game is solid. After playing Dark Souls 2 for the last month and wanting to play Dark Souls 1 without terrible jittering and bad overall port performance, seeing a japanese developer do a PC port right is truly a breath of fresh air.\n\nThe textures are not beautiful. In fact, some of them seem damn atrocious. For example, in the subtitles, you can see the discoloration of pixels around lettering... But the game flows well. The higher framerate really helps make up for lesser textures by making the game feel responsive and smooth as far as game experiences go.\n\nThis game also does something that I've long desired in games. Too often game developers fall back on cinematics to do the big awesome stuff. You'll get into a fight of some sort, and when it is over it cuts to a neat scene of the character jumping up and doing some fantastic gymnastics to kill the enemy... In Dragon's Dogma though, it is a lot more like Shadow of the Colossus. There are mechanics for -you- to climb up on the enemy, to get up to his head and attack him from there. It isn't just you watching a cinematic of that being done, -you- do it. In that way, this game is already leagues ahead of so many action games that rely upon cinematics or QTEs for awesome character actions.\n\nAll around, this is a good game. I recommend it. My only true issue is just how many tutorials there are. I'm 2 hours in, and still getting assaulted with pop ups telling me about how to do different things. However, to be fair it is possible to turn those off... It just seems like by 2 hours in, I should be past the "tutorial" stage in the game.\n\nGet it. It is an excellent deal at $30.","January 15","true","12.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Hopefully Capcom will release Deep Down on PC fast after the PS2, or, even better, make a proper Dragon's Dogma sequel. OK, I'm getting ahead of myself...\n\nDragon's Dogma is, in short, the prototype for The Witcher 3. At least in some aspects. That's how you'll feel the first time you slide down a hill, or stand in front of a message board. It doesn't have the polish of TW3, but it sports its own unique charms and mechanics, and the combat is solid and visceral.\n\nVisually the game holds up nicely, despite being a console title from a few years back. And knowing what a dedicated following it has, more and more advanced visual mods will be popping up for it.\n\nThe best part of the move to PC is how smooth the game runs. It's almost a completely different experience than the 20-30 frames it was getting on the consoles and plays damn smooth.\n\nSo, should you get it? An easy YES, if you're interested in any or all of the following:\n- climbing massive monsters and repeatedly stabbing them in the sensitive areas whilst hanging for dear life\n- spending hours in the character creator in order to get your and your pawn's facial features just right\n- did I only now mention the "pawns"?.. no other game offers sharing your fallower with other players like that\n- conducting crazy fashion experiments with your gear\n- some of the best combat in any action RPG\n","January 17","true","42.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/erikknighton/recommended/367500/","erikknighton","UberJiggyfly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erikknighton/","131 products in account","I don't often gush about my favorite games, mostly because I haven't had a whole lot of time to play games in the past decade or so. However, I was so excited for this game to come out that I'm going to act like a sellout fanboy for a second so as to explain its greatness.\n\n(As an aside: myself and the DD:DA community would like to see a sequel, and a PC port 4 years after initial release makes us very hopeful.)\n\nIncluding the PC version, I have purchased this game three times now, plus owning the art book. The original on PS3 in 2012, the PS3 GOTY edition just before my daughter was born, and now the PC edition which is has all the previous content and then some.\n\nThe best way I can describe the gameplay is to say Dark Souls + Monster Hunter. From Software's Dark Souls is my favorite game of the last decade (100% PS3 and PC, approx. 400 hours of gameplay), and though I've never gotten into Monster Hunter, there are some JRPG/MMO mechanics that are straight from that franchise (also, it's Capcom, so that makes sense).\n\nThe best way I can describe the world and "feel" of the game? D&D. This is the best analogue to Western-Fantasy role playing that I've ever encountered (heh, but all joking aside I enjoy ARPGs more than CRPGs, so you can argue all day the merits of my superlative classification). Say you want a full party of you and 3 dudes, balanced with sword-and-board Fighter, spell-slinging Mage, a Ranger who is all sharp edges, and a Warrior (i.e. Barbarian) who just screams, DBZ-style, at an enemy twice her size before her warhammer makes smashed-monster pancakes? DONE!\n\nSay, instead, you want to just go it alone because other party members are too loud and their actions aren't predictable. Roll an Assassin and you'll get BONUSES to attack and stealth for being on your own, even more for sneaking around at night!\n\nWant a mix of archer and sorcerer? Got that covered with Magick Archer (my favorite class)! Want a Paladin or Cleric, go Mystic Knight and get a staff as well as a weapon, and even cast magic with your shield!\n\nThe best part? All of these role-playing functions, like sneaking, fighting, and social interactions too, are organic. There's no explicit choice to join or deter a witch hunt until you question the angry mob. There's no "Press X to Roll for Charisma" to charm, but you can give the shopkeep a token of your gratitude for his help, and next time he might give you a discount (or fall in love with you, which happens).\n\nWant to back-stab that hobgoblin? Don't wear heavy armor, and move slower! Want to summon a tornado to rip that griffon from circling above and menacing your party on an escort mission? Chant a few arcane words and bring that fuzzy, feathered beastie down to your level!\n\nWant to keep a resurrection item for yourself because it's a precious commodity and you're afraid of death? The blacksmith's dead son died because he's an idiot and you have no obligation to be a hero.\n\nWant your Pawns (AI-controlled toons designed in and hired from other players' worlds) to rush to your aid, then repeatedly come close to death or run out of stamina. Would you rather they keep the enemies at bay while you provide support at range? Then give them melee weapons and good close-up skills while you kite.\n\nDiscover an enemy weakness that their master doesn't know? I can blast a wolf with a fire spell, they'll see its effectiveness, and report back to you the next time you find a pack. Did you take a different path on a quest than I did? They'll let me know my options if I have to do it again or even in the next NG cycle.\n\nSo I guess what I'm saying is, if you like ARPGs and want a pretty unique story and world to romp around in... Please do yourself a favor and buy this game.","January 17","true","77.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RudeRobot/recommended/367500/","RudeRobot","Human Time Machine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RudeRobot/","120 products in account","The Dragon's Dogma experience is essentially this: Do you like giant mythical monsters? Do you like the idea of climbing on said monsters and knocking the sense out of them? Do you like capes? Do you like the idea of killing things while looking fabulous in many capes? If yes, to any of these, buy this.\n\nThis game is a combination of Dark Souls inspired (albeit NOT near as punishing) + Monster Hunter, with a flat, lackluster story. Fortunately, the latter is easily overlooked by the sheer amount of quality content/gameplay the game is stuffed to the brim with. In-depth character customization and plenty of variation in gameplay, as there are 9 classes to pick and/or switch between.  Not to mention the unique Pawn system, which gives you more incentive to play and make your Main Pawn the most badass creature killer possible. I put well over 100 hours into the PS3 version back in the day, so this was an instant purchase when I heard it was spontaneously heading to PC (years after release).\n\nSince writing this, Capcom have already patched the game twice, so it is clear they are showing some support to the PC crowd. A lot of love and time went into developing this port, so I hope the success of this game on PC earns it the long, overdue, sequel it deserves.","February 21","true","232.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

On one hand it feels unpolished, featuring a boring overworld with very few actual locations of interest, a stupid stamina system that makes traversing annoying and some unfortunate mechanics that make you question why they even bothered implementing them (the "romance" system being the chief offender). On the other hand, the aspects of this game that work feel so good that the faults seem almost trivial. The game feels like a perfect mix between western fantasy and Japanese game sensibility, a classic tale of knights and dragons with a twist rooted in an interesting meta-narrative. Do you want to be a mighty sorcerer conjuring tornadoes and summoning meteors? You can do that. Do you want to be the sneaky ranged who climbs beasts with their daggers and shoot down flying fiends with their bow? You can do that. Do you want to be Guts from Berserk? You can do that.\n\nUltimately, Dragon's Dogma is a game that requires some patience to not only get into, but also to persevere through, but if you are a fan of a varied action RPG with the feel of DnD roleplaying and a very interesting AI companion system you should probably buy this.","February 4","true","85.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

My PC, with a GTX 750, can run it at max without losing a frame, so you should fare as well or better, depending.\nYou may here the term "Dark Souls-lite" in other reviews, especially those published post-Bloodborne, and yes, the game can be quite brutal, like the SoulsBorne games, but don't worry. There's no real grinding in this game, not until the real endgame, at least, so you can push forward through sheer force of will, which, by the way, is a huge theme in the game. You are Arisen, NOW PIERCE THE DRAGON'S CHEST WITH YOUR DRILL, SIMON- ahem, what I mean to say is THIS GAME IS MANLY AS ♥♥♥♥ AND ONLY FOR THE PEOPLE POSSESSING SUCH STRENGTH OF WILL AS TO KILL GOD HIMSELF, but you should give it a try regardless.\nAdmittedly, the world isn't very populated, especially in comparison to the Witcher III or... Skyrim... but its combat system is miles beyond any other open-world RPG I've played yet. If you're not a fan of the Witcher-patented "roll and spam X" or the Batman-patented "dodge and spam Y," then you might just adore the change in pace Dragon's Dogma offers. You may choose from nine different classes: three basic, three advanced, and three hybrid, each with their own unique moveset. Your three pawns will also fulfill these classes (though they cannot be the hybrid ones), so it's always a good idea to have a healer on the squad.\nWhere the game truly shines is in the boss battles. The sparse nature of the plot isn't for everyone, but I'll be damned if the boss battles aren't. In endgame, dragons aren't bosses, they're regular enemies. The epicness of every fight against a true monster cannot be understated, and it puts everything in the games listed prior to shame. You will feel a true sense of camaraderie with your pawns when, as a Fighter, you're clinging on to a Griffin for dear life as it begins to take off, soaring quickly above the heights from which you can safely fall, when, with a flaming storm of arrows, your Ranger companion will bring it down swiftly to the ground, allowing you to safetly jump off and regain your stamina. The music swells, your adrenaline builds, and you keep on fighting.\nI cannot recommend this game enough. Please consider buying it so that Capcom will see the want for a sequel, or, at the very least, to port the MMO over to the West. If you enjoy the pure fighting spirit of TENGEN TOPPA GURREN LAGA- I mean, Dark Souls, then you should pick it up.\nWHERE'S MY GRIFFITH AND GATTSU ARMOR, CAPCOM?","January 15","true","55.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sweetsyberia/recommended/367500/","sweetsyberia","Sweet Syberia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sweetsyberia/","455 products in account","A very good PC port, in my opinion. This game is very much open world and has excellent character creation.  You can spend hours playing this game and still find new things.  The New Game + option is also great and you keep all previous levels, abilities, items, etc.  The game does, however, get harder.  The Bitterblack Black Isle map is fairly challenging and might make you rage a fair bit.  You can also pick people up (including children) and throw them off cliffs so if that's a thing you enjoy, this is the right game for you.\n\nOne of the weaker points of Dragon's Dogma is, to some extent, the story. Some of the quests can be fairly repetitive (not as bad as saving settlements in Fallout 4).  One thing also missing from this port is the lack of Japanese voices (hearing "Wolves hunt in packs, Arisen" gets more annoying in English than it does in Japanese) but there is a mod out there for that, as well as a variety of other things.\n\nAll in all, if you're a fan of action role playing games that you can spend hours in, I'd really recommend this game. If you do suffer from arachnaphobia, there are some spiders but they're quite small and barely do anything.","February 20","true","726.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

Perfect game for a 9 year old like me :))))\n\nUseful things I learned :OOO\n1. Goblins are weak to fire.\n2. Goblins are weak to ice.\n3. Goblins are weak to both ice and fire.\n4. Fire sets a harpy's wings ablaze.\n5. Hydras have multiple heads.\n6. Ogre's get excited over women.\n7. Falling from too great a height can kill you.\n8. Many have lost their lives from falling too great a height.\n9. The animals of the field are a good source of meat.\n10. Pawns ♥♥♥♥ing suck.\n\nThings I liked :)))))))\n+The soundtrack is great. Masterworks all, you can't go wrong.\n+Great animations for the monsters and the attacks. Some of the spells are completely devestating and badass.\n+Great combat. A mix of Dark Souls and Shadow of the Colossus. You get to climb the monsters.\n+Good variety of "vocations" (classes). Helps the game's replay value and adds more interesting variation to combat and strategy,\n+New Game+ means you can start a new game with your old character, keeping the levels and equipment from your last playthrough.\n+Map is pretty big. Lot's to explore and the loot can be great.\n+Character customization is great. Characters are fully customizable.\n+Dragons aren't a joke unlike the ones in Skyrim. Battles can last up to an hour depending on the difficulty and how strong you are. Killing a dragon can be very rewarding.\n+Modding community seems fairly active\n\nThings I didn't like :(((((\n-No online. Would love to play with friends rather than some faggy pawns.\n-Pawns are ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. You can mute them but they're still useless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. At least the mages can heal you and the warriors can distract the monster for you but they die constantly and do the dumbest things. It is painful to see my idiot pawn hacking at the feet of a dragon or standing behind a drake's tail. Fun to throw them off cliffs though.\n-Voice acting is mediocre. It does add a humorous charm however, especially with your pawns repeating the same thing over and over and stating the obvious. Grigori has a badass voice though.\n-Travelling can be tedious. You need to run around the map to get to places and it's pretty big, after a while the same enemies will spawn in the same place. You need port crystals to choose where you want to fast travel but you need to travel to that location first and then place the crystal there. Port crystals are also fairly rare. The Eternal Ferrystone is what you use fast travel. It's useful but you'll still need to travel around by foot. I suggest getting a mod so you don't consume stamina while running otherwise you'll be running out of breath alot.\n-The main story is fairly weak. It starts to get better once you first meet Grigori but that's quite close to the end game.\n-Characters aren't very interesting. Pawns are boring. Other than a few characters like Ser Mercedes, Grigori or that Jester, everyone is either completely lifeless and dull or they're just annoying.\n-Ogres don't look like Shrek. This is completely unforgivable and it gives these onion lovers a bad image, they are portrayed as giant dumb gorillas. Very disrespectful and very inaccurate. I hope someone out there completely re-models the Ogres to look like Shrek.\n\nOverall despite the flaws, I enjoyed the game and I now know that falling off cliffs can kill you.\nI think it deserves 7.5 horny Ogres out of 10.\nRemember, Wolves hunt in packs!","February 21","true","159.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","3","5","3","0"

This game is definitely not for everybody though, so you should be curious but cautious.\n\nIf you want extrapolation:\n\nYes DD:DA has very fun, flashy combat but what I love about this game is how subversive it is. Capcom incorporates gameplay elements here that I want to see more of in mainstream, high budget gaming. No scaling enemies, weak spots on climbable monsters that allow for varying tactics, money is never trivialized, fast travel is economized, the game world is exceptionally tactile, quest prep is imperative, quests can get locked out, post-game content, NG+, deceptively deep number crunching systems that can be ignored or exploited, etc.\n\nIt can definitely feel strange at times though. There’s a lot of running around during the early game, you aren’t really given a fair chance on the missables, there’s potentially some really awkward moments regarding the romantic subplot, the story disappears for 20 hours and then comes whirling at you towards the end, your companions might not shut up, loot can feel underwhelming until late game, you’ll eventually realize there aren’t many cities/towns in Gransys, etc. But those aspects become very endearing once you’ve put time into the game.\n\nDark Souls comparisons are oft made here but they’re not very apt. They do share some things in common like a thick atmosphere, a focus on combat, minimal hand holding, similar style of fantasy, a creative online component, over the top bosses, amazing DLC, and probably more but it never  feels  like Souls. It likens more to the floaty spectacle fighters that Capcom is famous for rather than the weightiness of FromSoftware’s games.\n\nShould you buy it? I would recommend yes, on sale or not. The only problem I ever had with this game was the awful optimization when it was on console but now that you’re reading a steam review for it you can be sure that problem is gone. I wanted to avoid the recipe reviews that people tend to do for this game but just in case you’re still not convinced:  take your favourite open world rpg, mix in some hack ‘n slash lite, a heavy portion of Shadow of the Colossus, some Dark Souls flavouring and you’ll likely end up with something very close to Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen .","January 21","true","72.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I seriously love this game so much. I hope the online version gets an English patch soon. I had never played Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen and only found out about it a few weeks before it came to PC. Now I play it 24/7 like I'm going to die if I don't. One thing about it though.. the only problem that I have run into was at the final battle(no spoilers) when I didn't pack enough supplies. I ended up rage quitting hard mode to try normal. Then I realized that Normal isn't much easier, so I just lost out on the bonuses of Hard Mode for no reason and all because you can't set it back to hard mode but instead have to start hard mode all over from the beginning of the whole game.  So that's what I have to do... If I had multiple save files, I could have just gone to one of them and saved my hard mode. To be honest, I don't even know if I would change that, though. That feeling of loss I experienced was awe inspiring. When first I was learning how to play, the difficulty was the best part, and that just amplified it. It has driven me to madness. I am soaked in willpower to finish what I started and I imagine my failure has folded me through dimensions to start over again. Great game 10/10 would rage quit and start over again.","January 20","true","164.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It has many enticing features of the combat and pawn system. You can have a multitude of combat possibilties based on your chose of class and how your pawns behave in combat which is very rewarding for me. Early on when you're consistently changing pawns because only your main pawn levels with you the other 2 pawns you have to hire things are always changing up because even if you hire the same class the new pawn will behave differently in the world from small mannerisms to combat roles. Some end up sucking and you have to return as fast as possible and some you wish you could keep.\n\nThe story isn't The Wicther 3, but it still very good in itself. The world is set-up very well in my opinion to optimize exploration and feeling freedom but not having too much land to traverse for quests.\n\nThe graphics are dated given it is from 2012 but modders are already working on that.\n\nModding anything beyond the visuals is not recommended because anything that messes with the pawns(unless you play offline)can corrupt them and mess with someone elses game if they rent your pawn.\n\nThe game did very well on consoles back in 2012 and I remember spending a whole summer on it. This PC port is running very well and perfroms better than the console versions did.\n\nIt has some small quirks about it some people may not enjoy and don't, but it is well worth anyone's time to try out in my opinion!","January 16","true","11.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

Dragon's Dogma is what happens. One of the best games from last gen gets a makeover and technical improvements, while adding all the dlc and expansion content all into one excellent game. The result is a game chock full of content and excellent "hack and slash" gameplay.\n\nDragon's Dogma's basic gameplay and questing is more or less like your standard open world rpg. You visit towns, check notice boards, take on quests, kill giant monsters, etc. What sets it apart, however, it's the pawn system. The Arisen (Player character) has the power to invoke pawns, which are much like your traditional party members. You can fully customize your own pawn and they "grow" as you play the game. You can also take on the pawns from other players online. It's a mechanic that seems to incorporate some ideas from Pokemon/Tamagotchi into developing a character. It's a very unique feature that should be used in more games.\n\nThe game is not without its faults. Despite getting texture and framerate improvements, the game's age is notable. Not only in the visual aspects but the mechanics as well. The menu system is somewhat archaic, players used to the latest games might find it a bit hard to get used to. That said, the gameplay is still amazing. Like I mentioned before, this game more or less combines the best elements of a TES game with the best elements of a MH game, the result is a very satisfying combat. Few games give you thrills like climbing onto a dragon to hack its head.\n\nAll in all, Dragon's Dogma is a gem. It's not for everybody, but for the audience that it's aimed, it's definitely a must buy.","January 16","true","7.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

It has many enticing features of the combat and pawn system. You can have a multitude of combat possibilties based on your chose of class and how your pawns behave in combat which is very rewarding for me. Early on when you're consistently changing pawns because only your main pawn levels with you the other 2 pawns you have to hire things are always changing up because even if you hire the same class the new pawn will behave differently in the world from small mannerisms to combat roles. Some end up sucking and you have to return as fast as possible and some you wish you could keep.\n\nThe story isn't The Wicther 3, but it still very good in itself. The world is set-up very well in my opinion to optimize exploration and feeling freedom but not having too much land to traverse for quests.\n\nThe graphics are dated given it is from 2012 but modders are already working on that.\n\nModding anything beyond the visuals is not recommended because anything that messes with the pawns(unless you play offline)can corrupt them and mess with someone elses game if they rent your pawn.\n\nThe game did very well on consoles back in 2012 and I remember spending a whole summer on it. This PC port is running very well and perfroms better than the console versions did.\n\nIt has some small quirks about it some people may not enjoy and don't, but it is well worth anyone's time to try out in my opinion!","January 16","true","11.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

I came to it straight off the back of loving Dark Souls because I'd heard the phrase "You like Dark Souls? You'll like Dragon's Dogma". I didn't like Dragon's Dogma. I didn't like it at all. There were tips popping up every 2 seconds, annoying chatter from the characters, terrible voice acting, the combat didn't feel right and I felt completely lost once I got to Gran Soren and gave up.\n\nI was an idiot.\n\nStarting completely fresh with the PC re-release, I really wanted to like this game. Everyone still waxes lyrical about it and I just wanted to "get it". Initial impressions were better - I was able to appreciate the combat in a different light as I didn't have the muscle memory of DS in mind, and while the graphics are functional it has a good art direction and a blistering framerate on my mid-range PC.\n\nIt didn't take long to really fall in love with the game. You know when you're not playing a game and it's all you can think about? Yeah, that's what I missed from Dark Souls, and that's what I've got with this. When people recommended the game because I loved Dark Souls, it wasn't because the game is similar (although it does have some base similarities) it's because the game evokes the same feeling of bewilderment and wonder that DS does when you first venture out into its world. The game does little to help you understand the grander concepts and when you accept that, and just take the game at face value and start to enjoy it, explore it and decipher it - it's an absolute joy to play.\n\nGame to game, I come across something amazing. Wandering through the woods in the night and stumbling across a lizard-man attack party that's ALSO joined by a Gryphon mid-fight? Watching my Mage (Boobarella, for info) spaffing off massive Ice Shards all over the shop while two hired pawns heal and tank in equal measures? Amazing. AMAZING. I'm just simply amazed by how exciting the game is, minute by minute. I truly does evoke that feeling I got with Dark Souls - it's not in the mechanics, it's not in the world building, it's in the nature of learning, experience and betterment that the game starts to take over your every waking thought.","January 19","true","61.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

We should be able to command pawns properly and individualy for each battle, not just set inclination so they act exactly the same in each battle and situation. Also, they should never be able to change their inclinations, unless players chooses to.\n- Pawns are dumb, they could at least avoid freaking red AOE circle that counts down towards them being insta killed.\n- Very few interesting NPCs.\n- most of the top gear (dlc gear) looks terrible\n- auto rating of rented pawns if they die\n- "romance" is poorly made, if you want to put it in game, make it right\n- if you skip certain side quests, you won't unlock some other side quests and there is no warning for that.\n- game saving system is bad, it doesn't fit this game. It's similar as in Dark souls, but it works in DS, because DS doesn't have much of a choices to be made, at least nothing really important. DD however has bunch of quests, which, if you mess up, can lock away quests, area, merchants, npcs etc.\n- ♥♥♥♥ tons of clipping issues.\n\nOverall, game is lots of fun, especially core game on first playthrough. DLC is fun first time around, after that it depends what you like. If you like grinding for top gear, it's good, but if you like exploring, there is not much to do there.\nIf there is DD2 in the future I'd like to see pawn system get major overhaul and coop implemented with a lot harder "hard mode". Bigger world map and few more types of enemies with more lively NPCs wouldn't hurt as well.\nWorth the price.","February 2","true","95.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

It seemed like a really amazing game, and I was rather upset it was never ported to PC.\n\nFast forward to like 3 days ago, when i see this game for sale, and having forgotten it existed, I was rather confused. I knew I had heard the name before, but was it a good game?\n\nWAIT, I KNOW THAT GAME.\n\nI instantly sprung to the purchase button and preloaded it, awaiting the release day. And now that I've finally gotten my hands on the game for myself, I am SO, SOO glad it was ported over.

For a japan game it has wonderfull and at places even dark atmosphere especialy once you get to bitterblack island when you will get your ♥♥♥ handed to you on silver plate. I played this game after nearly beating Dark Souls and sinking nearly 300 hours into it with multiple characters and i gotta say this game is similar in many ways...the combat especialy in later stages doesnt hold your hands (fak the dragons -_-) and when you venture out at night bring your brown pants with you...and god that Post End game event...it gives the game whole new and dark feel. There is just not a lot that i didnt love about this game back then and even after all that time when it was polished a bit my love for this game is as passionate as it used to be.

I have the feeling that the devs wanted to make a MMO - Game, and while they programmed and coded it they had any problems and said "♥♥♥♥ it, we are going to switch to singleplayer". Thats the only way i could explain why the game feels so MMO-ish.\n\nIts not only the non-existing story, not only the world which just looks like a free MMO-RPG, and not only the group systems which feels like you woulda play a MMO. No, also the given monsters in the game are feeling like MMO-enemys (atleast the small groups on the roads and in the forests).\n\nNow you woulda think: Why am i giving a positive review? Well, because beside that "flaw" (which isnt realy, maybe you even like the feeling) the game is great. Especially the fights are so worth to buy this game. Its hilarious to firstly fight one of the "big ones". Climbing up a dragon to slash him so he gets angry/scared and start to fly while you still hang on his back. WOW, thats how boss enemys should be.\n\nI never was able to play Shadow of the Colossus because im a PCMASTERRACE-gamer, but this game comes realy close in terms of boss-fights i believe.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WaterZer0/recommended/367500/","WaterZer0","Water水","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WaterZer0/","73 products in account","I want to begin by saying that I really enjoy the "Dragon's Dogma" part of Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen.\n\nThe story is.. okay, whatever; you're the chosen one. It's super cliché, but it works.\n\nThe combat system overall is very solid. It's similar to monster hunter, and feels like a real action RPG. Melee feels just how you want, ranged rewards the marksman, and magic.. Magic is amazing. Each spell is unique (even the upgraded versions of spells are not just stronger; they have an added effect most of the time), has a hilarious name, and is useful in its own way (unless the spell is just plain useless, and there are a couple of those). The basic "fireball" spell you get at the beginning of the game? Still useful throughout your mage/sorcerer playthrough. Super strong endgame fire spell? Not your "bread and butter" at all. You will cast the "super strong endgame" magic rarely because, while powerful, it takes eternity to charge up, and you don't always have time for that.\n\nA lot of the boss/mini-boss enemies are unique, have a great feel, and require a different approach. You need to target weak spots, employ magical weaknesses, or both for maximum effectiveness. Cyclops and Chimeras are totally different and need to be handled differently (though climb and bash works reasonably well against both if you're melee). Golems are a really well designed enemy that require a super specific strategy and cannot be harmed by magic.. at all.\n\nDespite the huge, mostly empty world that you will run around a lot (though there are often little encampments strewn about) and the typical chosen one story, the game is solid and delivers an enjoyable RPG experience from start to finish.\n\n\n\n..and then there's the "Dark Arisen" part of Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen.\n\nWhile the areas in Dragon's Dogma might not be particularly amazing, none are reused ever. Dark Arisen is the same 4 (?) places over and over. The same dark, drab dungeon with a bunch of blood and bodies everywhere; I feel like I'm playing ♥♥♥♥ing Diablo or something (not a good thing). You can only do dark, hellish dungeon a couple times before I am absolutely sick of it, and Dark Arisen is nothing but. There's also a WONDERFUL mechanic where if you kill "too many" enemies in the same part of the dungeon, a boss will spawn.\n\nThe enemies in Dragon's Dogma are defeatable or avoidable; you cannot avoid several enemies in Dark Arisen. The areas are usually fairly small and force you into combat with either ridiculously powerful (I'm talking same fight-length as the final boss in Dragon's Dogma - which takes like 10 minutes or more), extremely annoying, or both.\n\nLet me take a little bit to explain "extremely annoying." There's a vertical room with broken stairs you climb by bridges going across the middle of the tower. You know what's the best kind of enemy to randomly spawn here? A dragon. Yep, a dragon. Something that flies and crashes to the ground if you hit hard enough. That means you will constantly be running up and down the room even if you're a mage (can't shoot straight up) only to then be forced all the way back down when it falls.. just in time for it to take off into the air again. That wasn't enough for ya? How about an enemy that is literally immune to damage unless you attack its weak spot which is almost never vulnerable while it debuffs you with blindness (your entire screen is a black fog, and you cannot see anything except yourself) and slowness (effects walking, attacking, casting, and jumping). This enemy is unavoidable and in another vertical room where you are required to be on the ground level to take advantage of its "big opening" attack just for it to then spew poison fog through the lower chamber meaning you must go back up the stairs. This fight easily took longer than the final boss of Dragon's Dogma and was mostly me running up and down the stairs just to get like 5 seconds of attacking its weak spot for a bit of damage.\n\nIf the above paragraph was not enough for you, how about enemies that kill you in one hit from full health while you're wearing highly protective armor that slows you down considerably? Giant dudes that have attacks that take up the entire tiny room they REFUSE TO LEAVE where they stay? Literally instant kill moves that you must avoid.. while you're stuck in a casting animation you cannot cancel (yes, you can cancel casting but not animations once you finish the cast).\n\nIf I haven't thoroughly convinced you that Dark Arisen is at the very least frustrating, the equipment you acquire during the DLC is randomly generated. You can buy strong gear in Dragon's Dogma from the vendor or will be given some periodically (or you'll find some in chests). The gear in Dark Arisen is not useable until you pay an NPC special DLC currency to "purify" for you. Once you've done that it will assign you a piece of equipment based on your vocation (class) and your main pawn's vocation. You wouldn't even KNOW that if you didn't look it up on the wiki first. If you don't like what it gives you, you can kill yourself and retry for a different item.. but only if you also switch vocations. If you want a melee weapon, you will get the same melee weapon over and over and over if you try to cheese it by resetting. Best part of all this? The "cursed" weapons and armor are uncommon and require you to either go extremely far in the dungeon (there are a couple of shortcuts at least) or kill the randomly spawned extremely powerful/annoying bosses.\n\nThroughout Dark Arisen I felt like I was playing a worse (yes, worse!) version of Vindictus which is a free-to-play grindy Korean MMORPG. Vindictus literally repeats places and enemies for dungeons (sometimes with a color change or done in reverse). Most weapons or armor require you to grind a ton and aren't even big upgrades unless you upgrade them a ton which require even more grinding, real money, or both. Why did I think Dark Arisen was worse than Vindictus? Well, for starters I wasn't expecting a lot considering Vindictus is free-to-play and literally made for you to grind (not that I like it), and the combat in Vindictus is overall better than Dragon's Dogma. Don't get me wrong, Dragon's Dogma combat is good, and has solid variety; but Vindictus has tight, skill rewarding combat (unless you spend real money and buy the healing potions you can use at any time).\n\nSorry for the rant about Vindictus, but I felt like the comparison was way too close to pass up.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed Dragon's Dogma, and I'm not sure I'll be playing anymore Dark Arisen.. ever? I've honestly never done the "quit to title screen" option after dying in a video game before today. I always keep going until I'm too tired or finish my goal for the day.\n\nStrongly recommend Dragon's Dogma to any RPG lover out there; I'd say it's a solid 8/10. I can't say I enjoyed anything about Dark Arisen.. none of the enemies were exciting (most were redone versions of Dragon's Dogma enemies with different weaknesses or a couple new moves), the story so far was extremely lame, the environment was bottom of the barrel as I already mentioned, and the loot felt like a free to play phone game simulator.\n\nEdit upon some more playing Dark Arisen in an attempt to prove myself wrong: At least 2 of the boss/mini-boss enemies have attacks with basically zero animation/warning that just straight kill you (Garms turning to the side or Cursed Dragons biting you). I fought the same dragon boss like 5 times and was killed from full health most of those times by a seemingly normal attack.. no warning, no charge up, just CHOMP and you're dead. Someone's probably going to say "oh, you were low level" or something. I was WRECKING this thing in like 2 minutes each attempt just to die right before I killed it; there is no way I was not an appropriate level for this encounter unless I'm supposed to kill it in one cast.","February 5","true","101.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

Please give it a read if you would like to know about all 3 releases!\n\nThis game surprised me so much, that it's probably my favorite game ever. It's literally everything I want in a game: Action, exploration, good combat, excellent soundtrack, amazing boss fights, and all around fun. I was sold on the game the moment I latched onto a hydra's head.\n\nAllow me to start off with a port report: This is an extremely optimzed game that puts all other Japanese ported games to shame (Aside from MGSV I love you Kojima). The textures may look dated, but realize that this game out in 2012. But don't take that in a negative light, it's by no means a bad looking game. The best way I can describe the look of this game is like a remastered PS2 game with excellent lighting. It may not look nextgen, but it looks clean and very good all around. If it helps, I'm a using a 750ti and can run the game at high settings at 60fps at 1050p. And if you have the horsepower, you can run it at 4K or 144hz with ease! Optimization at its finest!\n\nA minor heads up for anyone using not using a 16:9 monitor: You will no doubt have black bars on something like a 16:10 monitor. There's no fix as far as I am aware sadly, but it's not as bad as the console versions. Everything looks sharp still, just with half inch borders on top and bottom.\n\nNow, onto the story! It's pretty simple: A dragon steals your heart, and you must get it back. That's really it. You do go to the main city called Gran Soren for some quests but it feels like filler honestly. There are sidequests, but they're mostly for the money and experience. But it does get interesting at the end. Those who have experienced it know what I mean. Just trust me, the less you know the better. I'll leave the story for you to experience yourself.\n\nNow onto the meat of the game: Gameplay. This is without a doubt the main selling point of tghe game. Seriously, all action RPGs must look at this for reference, it's that good. Best way I describe it is an excellent 3rd person action game's combat, Shadow of the Colossus boss fights, and the exploration of Elder Scrolls. With a pinch of the Souls challenge early on.\n\nThere are many types of enemies as well, each requiring a different strategy. Goblins throw rocks! Wolves hunt in packs!  Bandits gang up on you! A Drake (Dragon) will chokeslam you if you encounter one under level 20!  So what can you do to combat these? Let us discuss vocations/classes! Before that however, here's an important tip if you find enemies overpowering you:\n\n"Tis' not defeat to flee from battle, Master. Tis' Survival."\n\nTake that quote seriously, you can get your revenge later.\n\nThere are 3 basic ones to start off with:\n\nFighter - A good tank class to defend others and yourself. Your sword can deal good damage and your shield can block pretty much anything. Not the fastest, not the slowest either. You can climb onto monsters, albeit slowly. Use this if you like to be the main offense of the party.\n\nStrider - A glass cannon, but very fast and specializes in the climbing mechanic. If you go into this game expecting Shadow of the Colossus like I did, this is the class for you. You're extremely agile, so make use of that ability as you have next to no defense.\n\nMage - The supporter of the group. Do not underestimate this class, as this is a game where being a magic user doesn't suck. You are by no means a defense-based class, as you can quickly cast a wall of fire, an ice explosion attack, or a bolt of lightning to enemies. Feel free to play offensively while occassionally healing/curing your party!\n\n3 more vocations exist, which are altered versions of the basic 3 vocations, If you notice you prefer using the bow of a Strider over daggers and need something for longer distances, go Ranger. And if you wanna be the most badass offense based wizard, go Sorceror and summon some of the deadliest magic (Trade off: No healing based magic)! Oh and there's Warrior, which is pretty much a glass cannon with no defensive animations, but boasts exretemly high armor. Be an Ultimate Warrior if you wish to one shot everything and are confident in your killing abilites! Finally, there's 3 advanced vocations: Magick Archer (Strider with basic mage spells), Assassin (Mix between Strider and Fighter, can use a dagger with a shield just because), and Mystic Knight (A fighter with magic abilities and exclusive weapons: Maces and huge magick shields. IMO The most difficult to master, but very powerful once you get it! GREAT CANNON FTW).\n\nNow to mention the pawn system! This is another selling point of the game! A little later after the prologue, you can make your own pawn/sidekick! They are essentially lifeless vessels who exist to simply support those who get their heart plucked by the Great Big Red Dragon, Clifforduin. If you need to make the ending better, I'd recommend you model your pawn after something without a soul and has no emotion: AKA Your best friend! Or you could be like pretty much every other player and make a waifu pawn. Sicko.\n\nSeriously though, if you could model your pawn after your best friend that'd be great.\n\nYou customize your pawn exactly as you customize yourself, vocations included, aside from the advanced ones. You can make them either a support/death Mage, a tankish Warrior/Fighter or speedy Strider or snipy Ranger. Experiment with what you think works best for them. You can also hire 2 other pawns made by other players! So if you hire based on proper skills and equipment instead of looks, your party will essentially be unstoppable :D I personally recommend having 1 Mage with good healing spells and is able to enchant your weapons against magic weak foes, 1 Sorceror that can summon a giant tornado, and 1 Ranger to snipe all those pesky foes.\n\nAnd allow to mention this game's OTHER main selling point: Bitterblack Isle! Thought the main game was too easy, even on hard mode? This is the place for you! One hit kill enemies! Death (Seriously, Death the entity is in this!)! Debilitations everywhere! Homosexuel ogres! And worse... Rooms full of enemies! All of that to get the best loot and challenge in the game! It's generally recommded you finish the base game first or are at least a high level as even at level 70, you may still find yourself getting your ♥♥♥ whipped by an elder ogre. Good luck on your second visit to the Fallen City, as well..\n\nOverall, this game is easily without a doubt worth the 30 bucks. If you aren't strapped for cash and need a new RPG to buy, look no further! The story while no means terrible, isn't the main selling point. But I'm willing to overlook it as the gameplay is amazing. And remember, this is one of those PC ports that must be the poster boy for console to PC ports. Take notes every other publisher!\n\nAlso the more people buy it the more likely we'll get a Dragon's Dogma 2.\n\nSo...

I didn't like it too much. I bought it on PC to see if I could enjoy it more (after all, I *hated* Dragon Age Origins the first time I played it) and guess what? I'm not enjoying it too much on PC either.\n\nDragon's Dogma starts with a dragon eating your beating heart, which I consider a plus. You're alive after the attack though, and some dude appears in front of you and another dude tells you it's a Pawn, and from there you're left to your devices mostly. Pawns are not-human-but-almost drones that you can recruit for your adventures, up to four. While you'll have direct control of one of your Pawns' leveling and attributes, the other two you'll have to rehire a bunch of times. Nothing else merits much more explanation, you just go out there and kill goblins.\n\nTHE PROS:\n\n- You can change between classes at any time and purchase new enchantments as you progress on a class, besides getting passive bonus that carry over should you decide to choose another. Same applies to your Pawn.\n- Combat is pretty fun, and despite being a party based RPG, the classic "triad" conventions can be broken pretty easily without much detriment.\n- It's pretty. In-game cutscenes especially.\n- Big enemies can be climbed in combat, which is fun. Some moves are geared towards working in tandem to reach higher, which is also fun.\n- Pawns comment on things, there's a *lot* of voicework.\n- Pawns will harvest for you.\n- Nights are unnerving. Lanterns are cool. Detailed and gameplay-relevant character customization.\n\nTHE CONS:\n\n- No enemy locking, meaning no strafing, meaning no manual dodging, meaning your character will run around the battlefield like a headless chicken.\n- Confusing controller centric controls that are hard to get used to on keyboard and can lead to a lot of mistakes.\n- Combat usually favors being aggressive as all hell and running around over defensive playstyles, shields aren't very effective against 2+ enemies at once.\n- Can't mark enemies, can't give orders outside "go" "here" and "help".\n- AI does weird things, especially running around without attacking.\n- No conveyance at all when it comes to quests. Players are expected to run around and talk to a gajillion people to either get quests or advance on said quests. That translates to a lot of time running around for eventually little to no payoff.\n- No control over hired Pawns eventually translates on running around some more trying to find a satisfying party setup.\n- No conveyance cont'd: player is given quests without even a general direction of the mission area, prompting them to either run headlong into an area that will certainly kill them, rely on Pawns for quest information, or better yet, having to look up information on the Internet. So either blind trial and error or preexisting knowledge.\n- Largely unsatisfying "crafting" and item improvement system.\n- Encumbrance system, while cool, leads to a ton of useless inventory micro-management.\n- Gold and experience gains makes you very powerful and ultra-rich too fast for the game's own good.\n- Inventory and equipment can be accessed at any time, including transferring items in the middle of battle, making item management and preparation pointless.\n\nWhile DD doesn't do anything egregiously bad and has actually some cool ideas underneath, it is definitely an experience that fails to enthrall. It is fun, sure, but given my choices I'd recommend more Dragon Age Origins to someone wanting a more traditional RPG experience, and Amalur to those seeking a fun hack&slash romp.

I'm already Level 200 and still not bored at all <3\nI have to say; It's my very favourite game!\nDragon's Dogma was a reason for me playing another  RPG's but I had to face it... There are just a few good RPG's in my opinion. But there wasn't one I enjoyed so much like Dragons Dogma!\n\nI love the story, the character-customization, the animations. the fight-system, the graphics...\nAlso you're not forced to do the story all time! You're free in Gran Soren.\nAnd well... If you played the story like 20 times you need this freedom!\n\nTo be honest, I never understood why Dragons Dogma is so underrated.\n\nI also think it's better than Skyrim,\nbecause Skyrim's animations are floppy, story is meh, character customization hurts in the eyes and battles are super boring! Also I'm not a graphic-♥♥♥♥♥ but let's face it: Skyrim is NOT a pretty game...\nOf course there're a lot cool mods! But Dragon's Dogma is able to be much cooler without mods.\n\n(I also can imagine the mods that'd be possible for the Dragon's Dogma PC Version! That'd be sooo awesome!)\n\nYou literally can feel all the love they put into a game!\nYou can find a lot of enemies of the Greek mythology, which I think is pretty cool! c:\nThe synchronization is pretty good even if you have to hear some quotes pretty often...\nI think... that could be pretty annoying for some kind of people, but hey; You can deactivate 'em!\n\nThe only negative thing I could find was:\nIf you're used to huge maps like GTA V, Skyrim, Witcher and Fallout 4... then you might be dissapointed!\nFor people like me it's more comfortable! I love open world but I always want to know where I am!\nI want my environment... comfortable and familiar and not huge and lost!\n\nBut that's just my opinion! <3\n","January 15","true","134.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I just cannot get away from the 'Pawn' system... it seems lazy, it's sometimes annoying and just feels like a loose end even though I'm sure it will have some impact on the story later on at some point. The way the game saves and re-loads after a defeat is kind of annoying and all of these little niggles seem to add up to overshadow all of the positives I found with the game. The fights are cool, you can grab enemies or attack ones that your helpers grab, buff characters with elements to do extra damage etc, but it just seems to fall flat for me.\n\nRecommended for general RPG fans who aren't as bothered by such details and design choices, but not so much if you've played Dragon Age Inquisition before, as I feel that game was, in general, stronger overall and seems quite similar.","January 18","true","3.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The upshot is, the letterboxing found on the console version is gone, and the framerate has been uncapped, allowing for much smoother gameplay. High density particle effects no longer slow the game down to a crawl, and a surprising amount of graphical customization, often not found at all in PC ports, allows you to tweak the game to your own performance.\n\nGameplay wise, Dragon's Dogma hasn't changed a bit. It's still the epic monster slaying adventure it always was. Camera problems still persist throughout, unfortunately - especially when climbing larger monsters. All downloadable content for the console versions is present in the Steam release, providing further challenges and extended replayability with the Dark Arisen dungeon.\n\nIf you want an action oriented RPG that doesn't hold your hand too much, this may be the game for you.","February 17","true","117.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Eventually fighting a "boss" monster that i am not going to spoil.\n\nAfter that you get this epic cinematic of a dragon falling through the sky. reaching your town...\nThen you get to create your character who is a local fisherman in that town.\nYou then lose your heart to the dragon and get sent off on a magical quest to level up to reach the dragon.\nWho is later your target in the future part of the game.\n\nNot spoiling anything else about that part.\n\nAlso you get to get a "pawn" who is your servant that fights for you. An AI that learns within battle to beat your enemies. The only problem is that this "pawn" will never shut up. You can also recruit 2 other pawns (these are helpful and annoying).\n\nAt first i was playing the game without knowing that i had "skills" to do more damage. So i was fighting everything using the basic and heavy attacks... (About 2 hours in i notice RB and LB have the ability to use skills)\nAfter i figured out that... It made every battle trivial...\nAlso Remember to save often as if you die... you can't respawn unless you have a "wakestone".\n\nAfter fighting another 2 bosses...\n\nYou get the most annoying escort quest... It's annoying.\n\nOnce you do a series of main quests. You will unlock the best battle in the game...\nTHE DRAGON... He was easy to kill but falling was my downfall on several occasions...\n\nOnce you defeat him. The world changes... to become alot harder...\nNo spoiling anything else.\n\nThis game was enjoyable. The world felt more alive than skyrim. Even on a lower budget.","January 20","true","49.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Which is very troublesome as it makes you do a lot of back tracking. Besides, a lot of npc in this game have dull speech line and same generic voice over. There are many weapon variety in DD but most of them only can be used by specific classses which is anoying. The huge space gap in the open world with nothing exciting to fill it also makes me want to quit sometimes. The world in DD is just too boring at times, most enemies are also reused mostly. The locations of each dungeons and enemy camp are all look alike. The most frustrating fact is the weight of most item as you will quickly find that you are overencumbered if you don't store your item frequently. The pawns or any other moving npc are f** stupid as well cause they will keep walking away from you whenever you want to speak to them and the pawns will always act way too ahead of you like taking all the drops and items and also runs ahead to fight enemy before you can explore the place.\n\nOf course there are good things in this game as well like tons of character customization (as expected of most japanese rpg). Great character model and monster design. Beatiful environment even if graphics are mediocre, lots of different fighting styles and ways of aproaching things. Good combat and great ai response in combat from both your team and the enemy. The menu and HUD in this game is comfortable for players IMO, great character introduction (most of them). And the best part in this game is the story is decent and very generic but it is the old school slay the dragon type which i like a lot so good job on that. The armors and sets of clothes in this game is well design but the downside is that  the stats are very weird like my very 1st armor from my item storage ( vagabond armor and lion's spine) remains better than most of the armor i found or bought. (as of 30+ hour of play time)\n\nAll in all this game has a bit difference than most open world rpg you find these days, some of the changes are not great but some works fantaticaly. So i give this a 7/10.\n\n","February 13","true","118.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

I hate it. It's horrible. I haven't had a good night's sleep in DAYS since I bought it. On days off work, I get up, I try to resist, but it calls to me and I can't break free! I've been engulfed by the perdition that is Dragon's Dogma and good lord am I ever obsessed with it.\n\nHonestly, I haven't been this IN to a game since 2001. And that's saying one hell of a lot. In my time waiting for a game that tickles my fancy, I've played things like Skyrim, Dark Souls, Dragon Age: Inquisition and the Witcher series-- all of them good, but none of them getting me worked up this much. Why am I so wild-eyed over Dragon's Dogma? What on EARTH could it be that makes it stand out from the rest?\n\nThe graphics aren't the absolute best. But they're not bad either. It's a good medium that focuses namely on monster animations and humbling views of the horizon. The only thing that I would say is inherently 'bad' in the graphics department is the mouth-flapping, and that can easily be ignored. I'm a child of the 90's, and I prefer blocky low-poly meshes over pre-rendered backgrounds (*winks at the PSX-era Final Fantasy classics*) over HD ultra-realistic mumbo-jumbo any day-- so it's easy for me to accept the clunky bits. It still portrays the imagery well, and in an unpretentious manner unlike SOME AAA games. But take it or leave it, while graphics do help, the GAMEPLAY tends to help more.\n\nThe gameplay being one of the main staples, of course. It really does lend itself to a more hands-on, tactile feel, and I really CAN'T get enough of it. Grappling onto enemies and stabbing 'em like in Shadow of the Colossus is just the tip of the ice berg. You have your Pawns to help you out in battle, and they really do MATTER. Not only on a tactical standpoint, but I end up caring about them, despite how annoying their banter can get-- even if I'd only JUST hired two of them. If the banter gets too much, of course, you can just turn it off. (I heard the original version of DD didn't have that option. This must mean Capcom has been listening to the complaints and wishes of players, which is AWESOME.)\n\nBut regardless of what you think about the Pawns, their AI is far more intuitive than the followers of Skyrim, or anything else I mentioned for that matter. They really effect the playing field on an extensive level, to the point where you're actually-- gods FORBID-- performing acts of TEAMWORK with them! With them at my side, and the expansively hands-on battle system, I'm actually willing to put this on a pedestal with my JRPG favorites. I lean more towards turn-based JRPGs than ARPGs, but in this I really feel like I'm putting some tactical THOUGHT into my attacks and actions in battle, rather than just swinging blindly and eventually winning because I had enough potions on me to keep my health at. (tsk tsk Skyrim, you've made a lot of mistakes, haven't you?)\n\nLeveling is a cinch, to boot. You don't exactly feel the need to 'grind', but if you must, you can just wander about the vast plains and check out every nook and cranny until you feel ready to progress in your quest lineup. And when you're exploring, you really feel like you're exploring. NO one place looks alike, and while landmarks are sparse, they're surrounded by vast fields of VARIETY. The job(/vocation) system is easy to digest, upgrading weapons is involving and fun, and there are so many item combinations I've only touched on about 30% of it!\n\nThe story isn't all that great so far as I've gathered, it's true-- but it is still INTERESTING, and the characters are memorable, and it does have a strange, eerie feel to it a lot of the time. ...I like it. I have no qualms at all with the story direction. Even the Arisen (whom I have designed to look like a cute dark elf boy with fiery dreds) is expansively expressive, regardless of their role as silent protagonist. Actually, the Arisen reminds me of Link. Hm.\n\nBarring the flagrant use of 'aught' and 'naught', I see nothing wrong with the dialogue. The voice acting may not be top-notch, but it still passes for its expressive voice acting and proper line delivery. Could use some background chatter sound effects in towns and cities, however. It feels really empty when you enter Gran Soren and NOBODY IS TALKING BUT YOUR PAWNS.\n\nAnyways, lastly the MUSIC-- while it's scarce during exploration, what bits you do get to hear are MARVELOUS. You just have to keep an ear out. It doesn't go in the 'cinematic' direction that recent AAA titles have recently, which makes me glad. I'm getting sick of that kind of pretentious drivel, and it's nice to hear a soundtrack that actually carries a note without sauntering off into a fadey mess of bullcrap.\n\nThere are a few things lacking, of course. Like rain and snow, for one. Very odd not having precipitation of any sort. Another would be the ability to at LEAST set up camp in the wild. There's been many a night where I simply wished I could just find a nice spot with my Pawns and camp out. Town chatter is another thing. Perhaps the distant sound of children yelling and playing, the occasional shopkeep hollering about fresh baked bread, women and men gossiping in hushed tones on the streets-- I know it's difficult to implement, but it really needs to exist. Lastly, I need a freaking mount of some sort. It really is a long trek from one place to the next, and sometimes we just DON'T WANT TO TRAVEL ON FOOT.\n\nEither way, I don't think we'll ever get such a thing in this game as-is. But perhaps if Dragon's Dogma gets enough attention, Capcom will start working on a sequel, and these matters will be addressed. Oh, I can ONLY hope! Please help make this little dream of mine come true, and BUY DRAGON'S DOGMA. Give it a whirl. You might really like it. Don't even wait for a sale, do it NOW.","January 27","true","65.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I later bought the Dark Arisen version and now am essentially on my third copy of the same game after purchasing the PC version of DD: Dark Arisen.\n\nI would also like to apologize if there are any spelling or grammar errors in my review because words are hard. ME SPEAK BETTER ENGLISH OF ALL AMERICAN!\n\n\nGRAPHICS: They really leave a lot to be desired. It has it's moments where the lighting looks pretty good but then you wind up somewhere else and it looks muddy and bland. On top of this the truth is that the game never really looked good graphically, even on PC the textures (though improved) are still pretty bad overall. They are still more than servicable though so this isn't a huge critisism and shouldn't bother most people.\n\nIt performs VERY well on PC and I have a constant 60 FPS on a pretty (by todays standards) "meh" computer. No slow downs or performance drops when tons of stuff is happening on screen. Lots of graphical options are appreciated which is honestly very surprising to me since many ports get away with the bare minimum. You have everything that most AAA games provide which even with the dated graphics is VERY nice to see.\n\nSTORY: The story is very awkward feeling at the start. I can never tell if this was intentional to make the player feel like they truly are somewhere unknown, with otherworldly things being treated as commonplace but still with a lack of understanding WHY they exist. The game tosses you into the deep end which isn't always necessarily a bad thing. You start the game and have your heart ripped from your chest and before you know it you're trying to find out why any of this happened in the first place. Why are you still alive? Why did the dragon do this in the first place? It feels like something that could either be a lucky mistake or a carefully planned sequence of events right from the start and sometimes you lose your curiosity for the story because you're too busy getting sucked into the world around you.\n\nGAMEPLAY: The example that many other action RPGs should take notes from. Enemies from small to large to behemoth are engaging and fulfilling to fight against. Whether they be goblins or bandits or cyclops or dragons there is always a feeling of intensity that a lot of other action RPGs lack. One of the other features that adds to the awesome combat is the ability to scale large enemies (freely, no quick time events) and grapple your way over to a weak point so that you can bring down one of the giants. Another great aspect of the game is that you can change your class at will once you reach the capital city and there are some skills that are cross class, allowing for a nice mixture of freedom and the urge to invest just to see what other classes are like since you don't lose anything by doing so.\n\nThe last bit I should mention is probably just as important as the combat and how fluid it is. The pawn system of course! This is a system that allows you to create a second character however you like and choose a class for them (which can also be changed later). They learn over time based on your behaviours and will even pick up knowlege when rented by other players from the rift! This gives the game a lore friendly form of community even though the game is basically completely single player.\n\nThe game is good if you like action RPGs. There's more I could write but I'm lazy.\nThe end.","January 19","true","23.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I stopped playing it because *minor and kinda pointless spoiler* I couldn't save Fournival (just a side quest dude) and I wanted that gold idol.\nAny who, back to my point, it released on PC which is an unexpected dream come true because there's no problems with loading times and the resolution is so much more clear and crisp. I've spent a lot more hours on this version so far and plan to spend even more.\n\nTo those who haven't played or heard of Dragon's Dogma before, if I had to explain its gameplay I would probably say it's an arcadey version of Dark Souls and Dragon Age with a more open world and has the monster climbing mechanics from Shadow of the Colossus, however it's difficult to compare or relate because this game is just so unique. It's how a good JRPG should be. The looting system is great and weapon and gear progression works well (although it's fairly easy to go to an area above your level and find overpowered loot).\n\nThe only thing I can recommend is watching gameplay as explaining it probably won't do any good.\n\nThis is one of my favourite games of last generation, I personally rate it a 9/10. Highly recommend for RPG fans!","January 31","true","134.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

You can mix and match some of the core abilities and augments you learn so you can build a character specific to your liking.\n\nCharacter Aesthetics: There is enough unique equipment in the game to give you multiple chances to try out and find something that fits your aesthetics or build. I would argue that the only issue i had in this game was there wasnt enough ♥♥♥♥♥y armor for my girl lol.\n\nBeautiful  Environment and Ambiance: the music and sound effects of some of the larger fights really bring you into the game as you become engaged with the visuals.\n\nUnique equipment: A nice visual touch coming from the Dark Souls series is how each equipment looks unique and allows you to mix and match to find that outfit you're going for. One minor differnce between this and dark souls is that if there is an armor set in this game, its just 1 equipment item as the whole set. Whereas every individual equipment you pick up is unique in its own set giving a much more unique feel to the game instead of looting the whole 'white mage' set in a single go.\n\nEquipment progression: In case you do find armor and weapons you would want to keep for a while, the game allows for simple weapon progression by the process of purchasing upgrades with money and materials. If you enjoy killing everything, you should have no problem finding the necessary parts.\n\nEverything drops something you may want: Some games you kill something and it'll drop like 10 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ items you will never want to pick up and only pick up that upgraded weapon that barely surpasses your own. In this game, you often look at every item because whether its a material (junk) that you need to posses for upgrades, or herbs / potion you will find yourself needing that in the future. I find that almost all the time im picking up whatever I can unless i have an abundance of it.\n\nCustomizing your party: At any time you want to completely change you, and your pawn's classes and the ones whoa re recruited in your party you can do that by changing their vocations. This makes it a little bit more fun as you can just switch the style you play at any point in the game.\n\nPlaying with friends: While you cannot actually have a true online experience with other players in the game. You can still share your pawn with them, and they can in turn, tell you about how disasterously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your pawn was in their game. Thumbs up.\n\nWhile there are a TON of things i would continue to boast about the game, I also want to insert some of the critiques and short comings of the game.\n\nCONS:\n\nCharacter Weight and Inventory Management: This part of the game is a bit painful. Characters all have their own weights they manage through equiped and inventory items belonging to that character. However if you want to continue a low level of weight, you often have to visit your inventory to move all Materials or other items onto another character and theres no quick way to do that. The AI of your party will also pick up items and thats a blessing, but they wont scour the room and pick up everything like you would.\n\nStory Dialog: while the short quests make sense and your interaction with NPCs seem all fine. A lot of the cut scenes with your character make you think your character is either autistic or mute. Normally this would be totally fine as this whole game has a Dark Souls feel to it, and nobody says ♥♥♥♥ in that game lol.\n\nAll in all, I played this in 2012 and again and I didnt think I would enjoy it again as much as i did before. Even more with the DA expansion.","January 29","true","42.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I think Dragon's Dogma may be the absolute definition of a flawed gem.

It has the open-world exploration that is reminiscent of games like Skyrim. It has awesome loot that is reminiscent of Diablo II/III. It has great tight combat controls that is reminiscent of DMC. But what sets DD:DA apart from those other games is the pawn system. The "asynchronous-multiplayer" aspect is one of the coolest features.\nPros:\n+Tight gameplay. I wish Elder Scrolls and Dragon Ages had combat like this.\n+Awesome visually impressive spells\n+Pawn system\n+Loot system\n+Avatar customization options (seriously more games need to look at how DD:DA 	does layered armor/clothing).\n+Day/Night cycle that actually is meaningful.

This game is made to be played multiple times with NG++++\n\nCons:\n-Story is not quite as compelling as say a Dragon Age game, but it is serviceable and at times can be compelling.\n-I wish they had more than just one "multiplayer bosses" (Ur Dragon).

This game starts off S-L-O-W and traveling to new places is fun the first couple of times because you're seeing all these places and enemies for the first time and you're learning new ways to fight them...but without strategically placing portcrystals around the map, traversal will become a hassle.\n\nThat's it for the negative!\n\nThe epic music keeps you in the zone, the rewarding feeling of discovery will keep you wanting to venture further and slay more and more enemies. From the small goblins to the massive Griffons, every fight feels just great. The amount of armor/weapons is awesome and were different enough to make every piece feel completely different.\n\nHere's one of many unique experiences I had while playing through new game:\n"I was on a narow pathway high on a mountain, accompanied by my three pawns. A massive, armored cyclops stands our way. The battle begins. My main pawn grabs hold and starts to climb the beast in order to reach its eye, its weak point. She starts hitting away at its helmet but this only enrages it. It slings its oversized club wildly, throwing the other two pawns off the mountain and to their deaths. I bring it down by hacking at its legs until the beast falls. My main pawn and I were victorius but we take a moment to remember our fallen comrades."\n\nMoments like these are what make Dragon's Dogma a MASTERPIECE. I would highly recommend you give this game a try. You won't regret it.","February 15","true","20.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While this could have been a case of 'too little, too late' - as is often the case with years-late PC ports - it is my pleasure to say that this is an extremely competent release, with a wealth of graphic options and extremely well thought-out controls.  And more importantly, DD:DA is a really fun and original RPG that brings a lot to the dance.\n\nRight away I noticed that DD has a very fluid, weighty combat system with a number of vocations (specializations/classes) and abilities for both primary and secondary weapons - it adds up to some of the most enjoyable battles I've seen in an RPG, in fact.  And you'll have plenty of chances to enjoy it, as basic enemies are plentiful and often a very real threat - as I learned when a pack of regular wolves tore my mage/healer pawn to bits and then mauled me as I tried to help him.\n\nDD:DA also has some of the most insane boss fights that I've seen - for example, scarcely 3 hours into the game my character is taking a nap, only to be awoken by the commotion of a dinosaur-sized Hydra attacking the town she was in.  I watched helplessly as it swallowed one of my pawns, killed several guards and in general wrecked the place.  It wasn't until I blew off one of the Hydra's cow-sized heads with a barrel of explosive powder that the beast relented.  I actually said "Wow..." out-loud as I watched this unfold.\n\nThat brings me to one of the key selling points of DD:DA, pawns - the legion of companions you'll have at your disposal.  To my surprise they are incredibly well-done, using abilities and strategies to a degree that would rival human players, and I actually enjoy the constant stream of banter and comments that they make.  Yes, it absolutely gets monotonous at times ("This road is shared by guards and fishermen!") but ironically, it makes them feel less like pawns and more like actual characters.  I also love that you get to create a permanent pawn with the same degree of detail and finetuning as your own character... that was a very cool touch, IMO.  I've said for years that I'd like a game which allows you to create your own companions, so it was surprising that DD:DA granted that wish.\n\nSo what's wrong with the game, you ask?  Almost 13 hours in, and my only real complaint is that the player character doesn't speak.  Games like Dragon Age, Mass Effect and more recently Fallout 4 have cemented my preference for a speaking player character, so I was a tad disappointed with DD in that regard.\n\nOh, and one of my pawns got stuck on a tree for a few seconds - but she quickly found her way to me.  And in the game's defense, I was taking an extremely unorthodox path to reach my destination.\n\nI could write much, much more about the game, but the short of it is this: DD:DA is absolutely worth your money if you're a fan of RPGs.  It is both an excellent game and a great example of how to do a PC port, and it is a refreshingly original take on the genre in an age of sequels and playing it safe.\n\nHere's hoping for DD2!","January 16","true","103.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The PC Port is great with only minor problems such as pop-in and runs at smooth 60fps on high - max settings on a GTX 750Ti and Intel I5 4690K @ 3.5GHz. Keyboard controls were surprisingly viable to use considering its a 3rd person action RPG originally made for console. There is only one small quirk in that you cannot use the scroll wheel in menus.\n\nDragons Dogam has a very unique combat system which allows you to use abilites depending on your class as well as basic strong and weak attacks similar to that of dark souls. As well as that it use a system called 'pawns' which allows you to create a character who will follow you the whole game and fight for you and has a ton of customisation such as the equipment they wear, how they speak to you, how they will react to certain battle situations etc. You can then take other peoples pawns and use them in your game allowing for a party of up to 2 pawns, your pawn and you. My only problem with the game is that when you start out, it is slow going with a lot of walking and a painfully slow escort mission.\n\nI Reccomend this game to anyone who likes action RPGs or a similar genre.","January 20","true","110.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Pawns are non-human warriors that are uncoordinated without an Arisen to command them... you, of course, are the Arisen.\n\nYou'll create your main pawn, a character who accompanies you through your entire journey, but you can use two random pawns to pad out your party. Unlike your main, these two should be chosen for their class and how it complements you and your Main... and as they don't level alongside you, you'll need to swap them out continuously to ensure your party can survive the battles ahead. I've seen Hitler, Yennefer and a bevy of other fictional characters brought to life.\n\nAnd here's the best part... those pawns you swap out belong to somebody else... and when you relinquish their service (or someone relinquishes your Main who flouts about while you're offline) they'll take back quest knowledge and monster killing experience with them. I came across a new enemy tonight and my newest pawn shouted that they were weak to fire and sure enough he was right.\n\nOutside of that, you've got a spell system that looks utterly gorgeous as various flares and lights strobe across the landscape... and melee characters can grab onto the flanks and shoulders of larger bosses, ala Shadow of the Collosus, and work to bring them down. You can even focus on separate body parts in order to weaken a boss quicker... and you'll need to because fights can be up to 15 minutes of whittling away and trying to keep your party on their feet.\n\nThese above systems are the best bit about the game, other than the world being a single continuous space (but with small load times at major gates/doors). Otherwise it's fairly generic high fantasy and it's as pretty as you could expect from a small-title game from 2013. It's also very much a Capcom game, from the quitting the game by going back to the splash screen to hit start to get to the menu to quit... to the faintly japanese manga music in the background.\n\n\n♥♥♥♥ing brilliant, in short.","January 19","true","10.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's no Baldur's Gate or Pillars of Eternity, but the atmosphere is the same. Gather your party and set forth on quests in a fantastical and exciting world. Make sure you've got the right supplies, play to your class, and take down enemies (sometimes by climbing on them Shadow of the Colossus style!), then buy new gear for the next adventure.\n\nThe game runs really smoothly as well.

First released on the Commodore 64 in the year 2 (the same year of the release of popular franchise Garshasp), this game is now available on PC, including all DLC (Acronym for 'Down-Loadable Capcoms').\n\nStoryIn Dragging Dog Man, you play as the Chosen Undead, and you must ring the bells of Awakening to succeed Lord Gwyn as the God-King of Lordran.\n\nYeah, that's all there is to it.\n\nGameplayThere are a couple of ways you can deal with encounters in this game. One such way is to tactically plan out your strategy beforehand, and then carry out such plans in the midst of grueling combat with unyielding accuracy and skill. Or, the more common choice, is to fork over your wallet full of shekels and tell them 'you don't want no trouble'.\n\nPawn SystemA heavily advertized and touted mechanic of this game is the so-called 'Pawn System'. Put simply, it's a dumbed down game of chess, with only pawns... kind of like how Gwent in Witcher 3 is a dumbed down game of Magic: The Gathering.\n\nThe VerdictThis game is trash.

If you're looking for an RPG that doesn't hold your hand every quest; a game that gives you the opportunity to wonder and discover for your own then this game is one you should put more research into buying.\n\nThe negatives that I found were pop in issues, and rare glitches that would cause me to stop moving.

Pawns are non-human warriors that are uncoordinated without an Arisen to command them... you, of course, are the Arisen.\n\nYou'll create your main pawn, a character who accompanies you through your entire journey, but you can use two random pawns to pad out your party. Unlike your main, these two should be chosen for their class and how it complements you and your Main... and as they don't level alongside you, you'll need to swap them out continuously to ensure your party can survive the battles ahead. I've seen Hitler, Yennefer and a bevy of other fictional characters brought to life.\n\nAnd here's the best part... those pawns you swap out belong to somebody else... and when you relinquish their service (or someone relinquishes your Main who flouts about while you're offline) they'll take back quest knowledge and monster killing experience with them. I came across a new enemy tonight and my newest pawn shouted that they were weak to fire and sure enough he was right.\n\nOutside of that, you've got a spell system that looks utterly gorgeous as various flares and lights strobe across the landscape... and melee characters can grab onto the flanks and shoulders of larger bosses, ala Shadow of the Collosus, and work to bring them down. You can even focus on separate body parts in order to weaken a boss quicker... and you'll need to because fights can be up to 15 minutes of whittling away and trying to keep your party on their feet.\n\nThese above systems are the best bit about the game, other than the world being a single continuous space (but with small load times at major gates/doors). Otherwise it's fairly generic high fantasy and it's as pretty as you could expect from a small-title game from 2013. It's also very much a Capcom game, from the quitting the game by going back to the splash screen to hit start to get to the menu to quit... to the faintly japanese manga music in the background.\n\n\n♥♥♥♥ing brilliant, in short.","January 19","true","10.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While this could have been a case of 'too little, too late' - as is often the case with years-late PC ports - it is my pleasure to say that this is an extremely competent release, with a wealth of graphic options and extremely well thought-out controls.  And more importantly, DD:DA is a really fun and original RPG that brings a lot to the dance.\n\nRight away I noticed that DD has a very fluid, weighty combat system with a number of vocations (specializations/classes) and abilities for both primary and secondary weapons - it adds up to some of the most enjoyable battles I've seen in an RPG, in fact.  And you'll have plenty of chances to enjoy it, as basic enemies are plentiful and often a very real threat - as I learned when a pack of regular wolves tore my mage/healer pawn to bits and then mauled me as I tried to help him.\n\nDD:DA also has some of the most insane boss fights that I've seen - for example, scarcely 3 hours into the game my character is taking a nap, only to be awoken by the commotion of a dinosaur-sized Hydra attacking the town she was in.  I watched helplessly as it swallowed one of my pawns, killed several guards and in general wrecked the place.  It wasn't until I blew off one of the Hydra's cow-sized heads with a barrel of explosive powder that the beast relented.  I actually said "Wow..." out-loud as I watched this unfold.\n\nThat brings me to one of the key selling points of DD:DA, pawns - the legion of companions you'll have at your disposal.  To my surprise they are incredibly well-done, using abilities and strategies to a degree that would rival human players, and I actually enjoy the constant stream of banter and comments that they make.  Yes, it absolutely gets monotonous at times ("This road is shared by guards and fishermen!") but ironically, it makes them feel less like pawns and more like actual characters.  I also love that you get to create a permanent pawn with the same degree of detail and finetuning as your own character... that was a very cool touch, IMO.  I've said for years that I'd like a game which allows you to create your own companions, so it was surprising that DD:DA granted that wish.\n\nSo what's wrong with the game, you ask?  Almost 13 hours in, and my only real complaint is that the player character doesn't speak.  Games like Dragon Age, Mass Effect and more recently Fallout 4 have cemented my preference for a speaking player character, so I was a tad disappointed with DD in that regard.\n\nOh, and one of my pawns got stuck on a tree for a few seconds - but she quickly found her way to me.  And in the game's defense, I was taking an extremely unorthodox path to reach my destination.\n\nI could write much, much more about the game, but the short of it is this: DD:DA is absolutely worth your money if you're a fan of RPGs.  It is both an excellent game and a great example of how to do a PC port, and it is a refreshingly original take on the genre in an age of sequels and playing it safe.\n\nHere's hoping for DD2!","January 16","true","103.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is fantastic. Lot's of fun. It's one of the few games I've played that felt like you were going on an actually adventure and facing adversity, running away from danger only to run into an even deadlier enemie.\n\n\nThe combat is fantastic, lots of cool skills to use with their own uses. The magic in particular is amazing, with a lot of very visually impressive and cool spells to cast. My favorite is Balero where you cause a ♥♥♥♥ing meteor to fall from the sky.\n\nThe port is really good too. 60 fps, runs real smooth. Some other small additions too like hotkeying items and what not.\n\nIf I had to ding the game on something, it would be that a lot of the game just feels...awkward? Just a little off. The story, the presentation just sometimes is a little meh. The romance system in particular is terrible, though it can be entertaining for a few minutes.\n\nAll in all, this game is fantastic. I highly recommend it.

The combat starts out as basically Souls Lite, but once you face giant enemies, it comes into its own. This game excels at making fighting giant beasts feel incredible. It borrows climbing mechanics from Shadow of the Colossus, but watered down to make it far more accessible and easy to use instead of taxing and more realistic.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elnumerojuan/recommended/367500/","elnumerojuan","Juan Becerra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elnumerojuan/","82 products in account","PROS\nFantastic Combat: Every hit feels so punchy and the slowdowns are just right. Grabbing and climbing huge enemies to hit their weak points is fun. rewarding, and exciting.\nDiverse Vocations: You start off with three basic archetypes, that being Fighter, Strider, and Mage, and expand to three advanced and three hybrid vocations. They all have their strengths and you should try them all out.\nPawn System: Think of this as Pokemon. I want to go fight a Griffin, but he keeps flying away when I try to hit him. I may hire another player’s mage pawn to give my team fire buffs while I have another one shoot it down with a longbow. In turn, others may rent my custom, outfitted pawn. It’s pretty satisfying to see my pawn gain knowledge of unknown quests, earn Rift Crystals (an important currency), and bring back whatever goodies they were sent with.\nNo Handholding: The game can often feel grueling in certain parts, even on Normal or Easy mode. Know that a simple tweak to one’s party or smarter usage of skills and positioning can fix this almost every time.\nSense of Adventure: I my opinion, this game has two major forms of gameplay, that being Preparation and Adventure. Preparation consists of stocking up on curatives, buying new equipment, upgrading existing equipment, and hiring skilled pawns. The adventure aspect comes from exploring new vistas and fighting unscripted enemies. You often need to improvise on the spot, which makes for some pretty cool scenarios.\nGreat PC Port: This port offers 60FPS and 4K resolution support which is something we rarely see from old console ports. The graphic settings are intuitive and keyboard binding is quick and easy. I’m also able to switch between keyboard and gamepad simply by using one or the other during gameplay. Even the button prompts immediately change! Furthermore, I’ve clocked in over 100 hours and I’ve only had two crashes (resulting in about 7 total minutes of lost progress).\n\nCONS\nWashed Out Detail: Although the game has a decent art direction and textures are a bit sharper than the console counterparts, the world’s soft and blurry greens and browns make it look very dated. It looks great when you look at the world as a whole, but a closer look reveals pretty ugly texture work.\nBoring Story and Characters: The game starts off with your player character’s heart  getting eaten by a huge dragon. You end up surviving and are revealed to be the “Arisen”. From there, the story is filled in with bland characters and bizarre plot holes until the story decides to ramp up again near the end. The expansion, “Bitterblack Isle”, tells a more interesting narrative, but that’s not for a while.\nFiller Quests: Unless you’re an insane completionist and want every unique weapon in the game, the billboard quests are best avoided. They usually consist of “kill X enemies that you’ve never encountered yet” or “Get X item that you’ve probably missed already”. Although the side quests are fairly serviceable, the frequent “task” quests usually make me dread talking to NPC’s with quest markers on their heads.\nUnexplained Mechanics: I’m a fan of challenging games, but straight up not telling me important mechanics is a bit too obtuse. To name a few, there is a difference between clothing and armor, leveling up certain vocations add certain stat bonuses that cannot be reversed, and certain quests will become impossible when you progress certain main quests (better hope you don’t miss any if you’re a completionist!).\n\nIN SUMMARY\n\nDragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen is a game for the patient RPG fan. The game has some pretty daunting issues, but it gets too much right to turn up. Give it a shot if you’re interested slashing up and burning a couple of goblins and cyclopes.\n\nSIDENOTE\n\nThis port is most likely to see if the US has any interest in a Dragon’s Dogma type game. The current success will most likely mean that they will either localize Dragon’s Dogma Online (the Japanese MMO) or create a sequel.\n","February 15","true","157.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For example, they've found a way to address the lack of a fast travel system while also encouraging exploration of the world around you by adding many more Portcrystal locations to the game. This way, you can create more fast travel points as you progress through the game. They've also greatly improved the visual fidelity.\n\nNow, on to the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n+open world with plenty to explore\n+minor skirmishes are fun and engaging (even if it's with the same mobs)\n+excellent party system\n+incredibly flexible vocation (class) system to cover every play style\n+challenging boss fights\n+speedrun and hard modes for those interested\n+real time combat\n+extensive character creator\n\nCons:\n-despite being presented well, the story isn't very strong\n-no mounts, so Ferrystones will usually be the fastest but most limited form of transportation, as you can only warp to any location you've placed a Portcrystal\n-pawns don't shut up, although this is more of a minor, personal gripe\n\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend this game for open-world RPG fans.","January 31","true","102.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The story holds a traditional, dragon-slaying medieval outlook mixed with magic and mixes it into something legendary. Sure, the storyline's short summary-wise, but with the amount of side-quests they added that can change it's outcome at every turn, it makes all the more enjoyable. The Dark Arisen expansion was a great touch and just made the game more interesting. Lock all of that with the new-game-plus and the online interactions, and you rarely get bored.

Dragon's Dogma always seemed like it felt at home on PC, and the narrow aspect ratio with poor framerate on consoles made it clear that this was a game with ambitions that exceeded what the PS360 were capable of fully realizing. This is an above average port, featuring a 150fps cap, a variety of resolutions, and the suite of settings that PC gamers expect. It's also very well optimized; my i3 3.1 Ghz with 4GB RAM and an R9 280 maintains 60 fps at a downsampled 1440p with all the bells and whistles enabled. I can't overstate how much of a gamechanger it is to enjoy the game without the black borders at a smooth 60 fps, with graphical enhancements that push the experience far beyond what the consoles were capable of.\n\nAlong with Red Dead Redemption, Dark Arisen was my dream PC port that I always hoped to see on the platform, and Capcom did not disappoint in delivering a version of Dark Arisen worthy of both the PC platform and the original vision of the game. The game also seems free of glitches and weird bugs at launch, with no crashes or other issues, and the ability to switch seamlessly between controller and the very playable KB&M controls at the press of a button. I've put over 100 hours into the PS3 version, and I can't wait to jump right back in. I can only hope that this version sees mods to expand the original vision, success to convince Capcom to work on a sequel, and the recognition that this diamond in the rough has always demanded.\n\nFor those who have never played Dragon's Dogma:\n\nDragon's Dogma is the quintessential flawed gem. To be honest, it falls short in some areas, but what it does right is nailed with such mastery that the game can be very hard to put down. It is an open-world RPG like Skyrim, but wandering in any direction you please is asking to be killed. Its relative difficulty and refusal to handhold is attractive to SoulsBorne fans, but Dragon's Dogma is much more transparent about how its systems work and the combat is more similar to a steroid-injected Monster Hunter.\n\nOh man, the combat. No matter what class you choose (or hybridize, or switch between), combat is visceral, tactical, and personally rivals only the Souls series in unique and excellently executed combat in an action RPG setting. It evokes Monster Hunter as much as it can evoke memories of playing Shadow of the Colossus as you climb up to the heads of absolutely giant enemies for the killing blow. Only it's possible to also summon an actual ♥♥♥♥ing tornado to take down said monster if you like.\n\nI speak highly of the combat because it does carry much of the game. If you play RPGs to take part in an epic and fleshed out plot, and don't like completing sidequests just because you were asked to, it's very likely that the admittedly excellent combat won't be enough to keep such a player engaged. The plot starts strong, goes to the wayside for quite some time, and pays off after dozens of hours of exploration and dangerous dungeon crawling. Like the Souls series, this is an Eastern developer (the usual Devil May Cry team to be specific) working with very Western RPG conventions with a Japanese flair.\n\nTo avoid a wall of text, if you like games that are eager to challenge you without being cheap, wished that a game like Skyrim was more structured and had way better combat, or if you're a Souls fan willing to try a more conventional and open-world approach (while having some amazing dungeon layouts), you should definitely give this game a shot. Dark Arisen is a very well-laid foundation that can be very addictive, but it's dying for a sequel that expands on the design philosophies here and has more plot (or maybe not, this may be a deliberate design decision). I overall recommend, but advise caution for those who seek RPGs like Skyrim for its total freedom or Dragon Age for its fleshed out plot and player input in the story. Even then, maybe it's worth trying something new? I could never get into any Monster Hunter game, but the application of its combat mechanics in this RPG setting combined with its Shadow of the Colossus-ness makes me wonder if maybe I should give that series another shot. I guess I made a wall of text anyway, I'm off to put another 100 hours under my belt with the definitive and best version of a true RPG diamond in the rough.","January 15","true","5.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/terzaerian/recommended/367500/","terzaerian","ж terzaerian ✌️","http://steamcommunity.com/id/terzaerian/","92 products in account","I first encountered Dragon's Dogma in a Bro Team livestream of the console version, oddly enough. But what I saw of its character creation there was enough to deeply intrigue me, and the more I read about the game, the more intrigued I became. One hundred hours in I can say quite confidently that the hype was justified, and this is a truly great game.\n\nFirst, the character creation. In some aspects it's not as flexible as, say, Skyrim, or Saints Row - in particular, faces are a much more daunting proposition to get right with this game compared to the former two. Fans celebrate its use of preset templates but I personally found that irritating and restricting. That said, Dragon's Dogma allows for a greater customization of body type than any game I have ever seen. Fat, thin, tall, short, muscular, lithe builds, all are in there. What's more, the body types have gameplay impact as well - taller, muscular frames are able to carry more items but are slower, and take longer to regenerate stamina, while small bodies recover more quickly and can fit through small holes, but can carry less weight.\n\nSecond, the combat. Comparisons to Dark Souls are rampant, but I only found it superficially similar. Overall, it is generally far less punishing than the Souls games. Timing of attacks is important, but mistakes are generally not as quickly fatal as they are in Dark Souls, and failure tends to be far less irritating, as the game allows you to simply reload where you left off and leaves out the soul-sucking regrind through respawned foes. The learning curve is overall much less steep.\n\nThird, the boss fights. They are all very well done. There is not an incredible amount of variety - when you boil each boss fight down to its essence, there are, basically, about a half-dozen bosses total, and for the non-quest related open-world bosses you encounter, fighting them becomes routine fairly quickly. The plot-related boss fights, however, are generally quite well done, especially the final fight with the titular Dragon.\n\nFourth, is the companion or "pawn" system. In my other life as a Skyrim modder, I made Follower Commentary Overhaul to try and spice up companions in Skyrim and give them a little more life by commenting on their surroundings, using recycled extant dialogue. Dragon's Dogma's pawn system is basically the platonic ideal dream mod I would have envisioned for Skyrim had I unlimited time, resources, and talent. Your main pawn can be customized just like your main character, for starters, and beyond that just about anything is possible. You can designate them as healers, damage dealers, tanks, snipers, virtually any role you want. They'll comment on their surroundings, on quests, on how to deal with enemies, or comment on nothing at all if you so choose. The best part, though, is that the game has a built-in system to share your pawns with all other players and enlist the help of their pawns in turn.\n\ntl;dr This game is absolutely outstanding on every metric I can measure an RPG on and worth every last cent.","January 29","true","242.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Now that I got the funny bits out of the way, lets get down to the meaty (And spoiler free) review:\n\nThere are a lot of fanboys/girls that give this game more credit than it deserves. There are also the few that absolutely hate this game's guts. I am here to stifle that and show no bias towards the game whatsoever.\n\nTo start things off, lets go with the good:\n\nThis game, as many have stated, has a lot in common with Dark Souls, Monster Hunter, Devil May Cry, and Shadow of the Collossus... but this is in gameplay only.\n\nThe combat you will dig yourself into for playing this game is equal parts skill, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ttery, tactics, and fun. It's combat system is extensive, one I have yet to be bored of. Nine classes (Vocations) are yours to choose from, and the game goes out of it's way to make sure you can't ♥♥♥♥ things up for yourself. No matter what you choose, when you change, how you play, you're going to have fun beating the everloving ♥♥♥♥ out of giant monsters. I have not even touched all nine classes yet and I'm looking forward to after maxing my character's level. For those that like grind and minmax... it has JUST the right amount of that in this game. Grinding isn't tedious thanks to how the end of the game works! Doubly so for it's expansion, Bitterback Isles. In between combat and managing your pawns, you'll barely notice the grind you're doing because you'll be focusing on how ♥♥♥♥ing awesome you are. TLDR; The combat has weight.\n\nThe equipment system is something I only wished Skyrim had. Mixing and matching parts (Or trying to match parts in my case) is fun and exciting, and you look forward to the next set of unlocks to buy as you work your way to the top. Equipment is only a fourth of your effectiveness in this game, however... though it pays to be well equipped. Equipment is handled in a fashion more realistically than some RPG's would normally do. The weight system shows you when too much is just too much, and unlike gaining the ability to carry more,  you realistically have a static limit on your weight. Gone are the days of carrying 600 lb's worth of equips because your character is well leveled. Instead, your weight limit is based on your character creation: The build, height, and weight all affect your most basic of stats in the game, and instead of the weight limit changing throughout the game, augments and class determine how much is very light, light, or heavy within that limit. Your armor weight doesn't disappear from simply wearing it, your healing items and special enhancement items have weight, so weight management is a must. Having party members to carry a lot of excess items is the best way to handle things. Armor is handled in such a way as to have multiple parts. Clothing to wear under armor, armor itself is all taken into account. For example, my main pawn has a very reasonable chain mail set under her normal armor to help with any weak points she may have! My main character, a strider, is wearing lightweight clothing underneath her leather armor to reduce weight and maintain mobility. This ties in to inventory and weight management. Sometimes there is too much you can carry, and not having proper mobility in a fight can be devastating, even for a tank or fighter.\n\nThe map is incredibly huge to say the least. It's up there with Skyrim... maybe even bigger than that if only slightly. There is plenty to explore, plenty to gather.\n\nThese are the great points of the game. Now onto the bad parts:\n\nThe exploration and backtracking can be tedious to some who don't like to smell the roses on the way to kick some ♥♥♥ and take some names. The quests are lackluster and aren't engaging to say the very least. There is no real fast travel mechanic until you can get your hands on some portcrystals. So there is no way to let your laziness shine in this game.\n\nAt first glance, there appears to be nearly no story. To those with low patience and a short attention span, this game will not catch their eye. This is no insult, of course... but in a gaming world dominated by people who fancy cutsenes, graphics, and incredible voice acting, this game is not attractive. One has to dig very deep into the lore to find the diamond burried under lumps of coal. While the story is deep and the philosophy of the game incredible, it's poorly executed by today's 'standards'.\n\nDialogue for pawns is incredibly repetitive... but the combat AI, once they have learned what to do in combat, is very well done. But the dialogue, man, if you can't stand it you need to turn it off in options, because it can drive you nuts.\n\nIt's graphics are not passable by todays high standards. But that's only because it was made a while back.\n\nTLDR; The game could use more polish on the story execution and a comprehensive (Unrealistic) fast travel for the lazy western audience.\n\nAll in all, this is a game for those with patience. It is not perfect, but not trash either.\nI would recommend this game to a lot of my friends, though it's up to you(the reader) whether or not to buy this title.\n\nPersonal rating (Bias): 9/10\n\nNon-personal, objective rating (Unbiased): 7/10","January 30","true","265.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","3","6","3","0"

I stopped playing it because *minor and kinda pointless spoiler* I couldn't save Fournival (just a side quest dude) and I wanted that gold idol.\nAny who, back to my point, it released on PC which is an unexpected dream come true because there's no problems with loading times and the resolution is so much more clear and crisp. I've spent a lot more hours on this version so far and plan to spend even more.\n\nTo those who haven't played or heard of Dragon's Dogma before, if I had to explain its gameplay I would probably say it's an arcadey version of Dark Souls and Dragon Age with a more open world and has the monster climbing mechanics from Shadow of the Colossus, however it's difficult to compare or relate because this game is just so unique. It's how a good JRPG should be. The looting system is great and weapon and gear progression works well (although it's fairly easy to go to an area above your level and find overpowered loot).\n\nThe only thing I can recommend is watching gameplay as explaining it probably won't do any good.\n\nThis is one of my favourite games of last generation, I personally rate it a 9/10.

You can mix and match some of the core abilities and augments you learn so you can build a character specific to your liking.\n\nCharacter Aesthetics: There is enough unique equipment in the game to give you multiple chances to try out and find something that fits your aesthetics or build. I would argue that the only issue i had in this game was there wasnt enough ♥♥♥♥♥y armor for my girl lol.\n\nBeautiful  Environment and Ambiance: the music and sound effects of some of the larger fights really bring you into the game as you become engaged with the visuals.\n\nUnique equipment: A nice visual touch coming from the Dark Souls series is how each equipment looks unique and allows you to mix and match to find that outfit you're going for. One minor differnce between this and dark souls is that if there is an armor set in this game, its just 1 equipment item as the whole set. Whereas every individual equipment you pick up is unique in its own set giving a much more unique feel to the game instead of looting the whole 'white mage' set in a single go.\n\nEquipment progression: In case you do find armor and weapons you would want to keep for a while, the game allows for simple weapon progression by the process of purchasing upgrades with money and materials. If you enjoy killing everything, you should have no problem finding the necessary parts.\n\nEverything drops something you may want: Some games you kill something and it'll drop like 10 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ items you will never want to pick up and only pick up that upgraded weapon that barely surpasses your own. In this game, you often look at every item because whether its a material (junk) that you need to posses for upgrades, or herbs / potion you will find yourself needing that in the future. I find that almost all the time im picking up whatever I can unless i have an abundance of it.\n\nCustomizing your party: At any time you want to completely change you, and your pawn's classes and the ones whoa re recruited in your party you can do that by changing their vocations. This makes it a little bit more fun as you can just switch the style you play at any point in the game.\n\nPlaying with friends: While you cannot actually have a true online experience with other players in the game. You can still share your pawn with them, and they can in turn, tell you about how disasterously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your pawn was in their game. Thumbs up.\n\nWhile there are a TON of things i would continue to boast about the game, I also want to insert some of the critiques and short comings of the game.\n\nCONS:\n\nCharacter Weight and Inventory Management: This part of the game is a bit painful. Characters all have their own weights they manage through equiped and inventory items belonging to that character. However if you want to continue a low level of weight, you often have to visit your inventory to move all Materials or other items onto another character and theres no quick way to do that. The AI of your party will also pick up items and thats a blessing, but they wont scour the room and pick up everything like you would.\n\nStory Dialog: while the short quests make sense and your interaction with NPCs seem all fine. A lot of the cut scenes with your character make you think your character is either autistic or mute. Normally this would be totally fine as this whole game has a Dark Souls feel to it, and nobody says ♥♥♥♥ in that game lol.\n\nAll in all, I played this in 2012 and again and I didnt think I would enjoy it again as much as i did before. Even more with the DA expansion.","January 29","true","42.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

While this could have been a case of 'too little, too late' - as is often the case with years-late PC ports - it is my pleasure to say that this is an extremely competent release, with a wealth of graphic options and extremely well thought-out controls.  And more importantly, DD:DA is a really fun and original RPG that brings a lot to the dance.\n\nRight away I noticed that DD has a very fluid, weighty combat system with a number of vocations (specializations/classes) and abilities for both primary and secondary weapons - it adds up to some of the most enjoyable battles I've seen in an RPG, in fact.  And you'll have plenty of chances to enjoy it, as basic enemies are plentiful and often a very real threat - as I learned when a pack of regular wolves tore my mage/healer pawn to bits and then mauled me as I tried to help him.\n\nDD:DA also has some of the most insane boss fights that I've seen - for example, scarcely 3 hours into the game my character is taking a nap, only to be awoken by the commotion of a dinosaur-sized Hydra attacking the town she was in.  I watched helplessly as it swallowed one of my pawns, killed several guards and in general wrecked the place.  It wasn't until I blew off one of the Hydra's cow-sized heads with a barrel of explosive powder that the beast relented.  I actually said "Wow..." out-loud as I watched this unfold.\n\nThat brings me to one of the key selling points of DD:DA, pawns - the legion of companions you'll have at your disposal.  To my surprise they are incredibly well-done, using abilities and strategies to a degree that would rival human players, and I actually enjoy the constant stream of banter and comments that they make.  Yes, it absolutely gets monotonous at times ("This road is shared by guards and fishermen!") but ironically, it makes them feel less like pawns and more like actual characters.  I also love that you get to create a permanent pawn with the same degree of detail and finetuning as your own character... that was a very cool touch, IMO.  I've said for years that I'd like a game which allows you to create your own companions, so it was surprising that DD:DA granted that wish.\n\nSo what's wrong with the game, you ask?  Almost 13 hours in, and my only real complaint is that the player character doesn't speak.  Games like Dragon Age, Mass Effect and more recently Fallout 4 have cemented my preference for a speaking player character, so I was a tad disappointed with DD in that regard.\n\nOh, and one of my pawns got stuck on a tree for a few seconds - but she quickly found her way to me.  And in the game's defense, I was taking an extremely unorthodox path to reach my destination.\n\nI could write much, much more about the game, but the short of it is this: DD:DA is absolutely worth your money if you're a fan of RPGs.  It is both an excellent game and a great example of how to do a PC port, and it is a refreshingly original take on the genre in an age of sequels and playing it safe.\n\nHere's hoping for DD2!","January 16","true","103.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
