What does this mean for you, however? This game provides stunningly realistic vehicle deformations, much like Rigs of Rods, which BeamNG.drive is based off. BeamNG.drive tries to be the most accurate vehicle damaging simulator, and it is succeeding. While it is still only in Alpha, I strongly recommend picking this up if you're like me and find pleasure in smashing pickup trucks into small Japanese compact cars.\n\nIf you wish to own this title, you can order a Steam Alpha key at their website, http://www.beamng.com/","August 11, 2014","true","46.3"," 612 of 670 people (91%) found this review helpful 85 people found this review funny","91","612","670","85","78"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecomputerexpert/recommended/284160/","thecomputerexpert","gigawert","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecomputerexpert/","5 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is a long, in-depth review, so bear with me. :P\n\nThis is an awesome simulator! You can do anything you want with cars. The base game comes with 11 worlds (aka terrains) to explore, and they range from 1 square kilometer to 2 square kilometers. The developers do, however make them seem much bigger despite their real size. There is also an infinite grid map which is completely flat and empty and the ground is nothing more than a grid.\n\nHere are the vehicles included with BeamNG. When I say a car resembles another real-life one, you may or may not agree, OK?\nAlso in the base game are 14 fictional vehicles based off of real-life vehicles, which are FULLY customizable. You can customize everything from the color of the car to the design of the tailpipe. Currently there are 2 classic cars based off of American cars of the 1960's and 70's (Gavril Barstow and Bruckell Moonhawk), a super fast Italian car that is similar to a 1980's and 90's Ferrari (Civetta Bolide),  a boring to drive car (Ibishu Pessima) from the late 90's and early 2000s that is the equivalent of a Japanese mid-sized car such as the Toyota Corolla. There is also a somewhat modern pickup truck (Gavril D-15) that is Ford Ranger sized, a full-sized van for cargo (Gavril H-series) that is like the Ford E-series, a Chevy Tahoe-style SUV that shares much of the same parts as the D-15, a car that would be used for drifting (Ibishu 200BX) if it was real and has body curves like a Nissan 240SX, and finally an American full-sized car (Gavril Grand Marshal) that seems to resemble a Ford Crown Victoria and is commonly used as a police car. There are still some cars I didn't mention that are pretty interesting, so those are only some of the cars.\n\nAnyway, enough about the content. Let's get into the gameplay and physics.\n\nAlthough for now there is no Career mode, this simulator is still very fun to play. There are scenarios, and they are usually coordinated time trials on a specific course on a specific terrain. Sometimes it is just for fun, like jumping a van off a ramp and landing unscathed.\n\nAnd the physics, oh they will not get any better than this. BeamNG is the most realistic and detailed vehicle simulator to date. It simulates the behavior of vehicles from the glass breaking to the hubcaps falling off. BeamNG uses a unique system for ultra-realistic vehicle behavior that yields a unique gaming experience each time. It uses beams (BEAMng) and nodes to simulate each and every part independently. The nodes connect all of the thousands of beams together, and the beams can deform, bend, and break. There are no predefined damage models. The node and beam system calculates the damage on any one section of the car. For example, if you slide past a wall in a Need For Speed game, with the front facing it slightly more than the back, the windows will probably shatter and then there will be paint scratches on random places of the car. Let's slide past that same wall in BeamNG. The mirror fell off and there is a dent in the front bumper EXACTLY where the car contacted the wall. Also a hubcap most likely fell off if the car had plastic rims.\n\nIf all that isn't enough, there is a big community on the BeamNG forums cranking out mods frequently. There are about 50 extra vehicles for download at the time of this writing and well over 75 terrains.\n\nAnd, finally, let's talk customization. Let's take the D-15 for example. For this single vehicle, you can customize the paint job, the tow hitch, the type of engine (I6 or V8), supercharger, lights, color, bumper type and color, suspension, body, and even the light bar to name a few. So the bottom line is, this game offers more customization options than any other driving game currently on the market.\n\nI hope this review was helpful to any new BeamNG players. Enjoy this wonderful game!","December 5, 2015","true","198.9"," 200 of 209 people (96%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","96","200","209","14","2"

BeamNG.drive not only lets you drive realistic cars, it also lets you crash them into each other! While the racing may not appeal to those who don’t use a wheel, the game’s awesome physics can be easily enjoyed using a gamepad or even a keyboard. It’s worth mentioning I’m in the camp of mainly crashing things into each other so I won’t focus so much on anything more heavily related to racing.\n\nWhile I’ve only recently received the game I have been following its progress for around a year and it has received regular updates during that time. Obviously it’s still not a finished product but what’s already in the game is good and if the devs continue working on the game it’s only going to get better.\n\nFull Disclosure: A review copy was provided by the developer.\n\nPresentation\nAs you’d expect from a realistic simulator, it’s a good looking game. Of course it’s not to the point of being photo-realistic but everything looks good enough in the game to make it feel about as real as a simulator can be. The UI and menus are absolutely spot on for the game, the speedometer is usually the only visible UI element and it’s only visible when you’re using the third person camera, it’s out of the way otherwise which certainly helps your driving if you’re just smashing things into each other. The menus are simple and easy to use and even when you’re using the menu you can still see most of the screen (which is good because you’ll occasionally want to be editing your option while playing the game, for example if you want to increase gravity while you’re mid-air to utterly obliterate your car).\n\nGameplay\nBeamNG.drive’s two (current) game modes are Scenarios and Free Roam with a Career mode coming soon. The Scenario game mode features pre-made scenarios from the developers themselves as well as any user made scenarios that you download from the BeamNG website. Generally these scenarios are either races or car tests but some of them are a little more exciting (not to say the others aren’t fun) such as scenarios where you drive a police car and you have to stop a speeding vehicle. The Free Roam mode is pretty much self-explanatory, you can choose one of the game’s eleven maps with any of the game’s thirteen vehicles. You can also use other in-game objects here too like a giant hamster wheel or a canon. Free Roam is where you’ll be making your own scenarios if you’re so inclined but as far as I can tell you need the Scenario editing mod from the website to do this. But if you don’t want to make your own scenarios it can be a lot of fun to just drive your car around one of the Island maps or smash it into things in the gridmap full of ramps and other fun things.\n\nRealism\nRealism is of course the most important part of a simulation game and, as far as I can tell, BeamNG.drive is pretty realistic. Now it is worth mentioning that I don’t drive and I’ve never seen a real car crash but I reckon I’ve got enough experience as a passenger and as someone who has a decent knowledge of physics to comment on this aspect of the game.\n\nOf course it’s hard to tell when playing with a gamepad rather than a wheel but vehicle handling seems pretty solid. As far as I know there’s no traction control for the vehicles in the game so things do get a little bit skiddy from time to time but the cars all feel pretty weighty (apart from the three wheel Pigeon of course). The soft body physics are out of this world good, I don’t think I’ve come across a game with better. Obviously slamming things into each other looks good but it’s when you misjudge a corner and go head on into a tree that you really see just how powerful the engine is.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=569607633\n\nMiscellaneous When in Free Roam you have control over environmental variables such as time of day and gravity and in both Free Roam and Scenarios you’re able to slow down time up to 100x.\nAll thirteen vehicles have several different pre-made configurations but you can customize the cars with parts and paint jobs as well as then save whatever you make to be used in future.\nThe game ran really well for me despite the fact that I have a pretty weak GPU.\nThere’s not a huge amount of ‘defined’ content right now so if you’re not the kind of person who can make their own fun in a sandbox game then you may wish to hit the follow button instead of buying the game for the time being. Just to be clear, there’s probably a good few hours of scenarios\nThe engine sounds didn’t sound too realistic to me but that may just be from a lack of car knowledge rather than the sounds being unrealistic. It turns out that these sound effects are simply placeholders for the time being. The crashing sound effects are reasonably good but if you’re hitting things for a prolonged period of time it seems the sound effects are only audible from time to time rather than every time there’s a collision.\nWhile the vehicles in the game aren’t ‘real’ makes and models they are all based on real vehicles.\nVerdict\nWorth Purchasing.  (If you like Sandbox physics games)\n\nBeamNG.drive may be lacking in 'defined' content but it more than makes up for it with its incredibly realistic soft body physics and good graphics. If you want a realistic driving sim or you just want to crash things into each other then chances are you’ll enjoy this game!\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","December 9, 2015","true","8.5"," 162 of 190 people (85%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","85","162","190","10","14"

At the moment, you should know BeamNG is not a game.  It's at best a sandbox title with most of the necessary content missing.  Its far better to say at the moment that its a game engine looking for a game.  But what a game engine ...\n\nThe content, as it stands, offers you the chance to drive round a handful of locations.  Thanks to Johnny3600 who points out that this game uses Torque3D as an engine, not the CryEngine as I first thought (though the backgrounds are very Far Cry - think tropical, vegetation, poorish roads), but critically are quite large and varied.  So you can expect well-made tarmacked roads to ring islands, with grotty little dirt tracks in the centre often leading to ledges, mountains etc.  The vehicles are mostly regular cars (I believe generic models), including pickups and a Rig.  Don't expect forumula 1 cars, this is a far more everyday selection of vehicles.\n\nSo far it all sounds uninspiring.  What makes it so good?  Well, the physics engine effectively makes it a crash simulator.  Every piece of each car is detailed to give it form, bendableness, weight and mass, etc.  When assembled they work as a real car would, but when you come into contact with something they all crush, get displaced and generally smash up most convincingly.  On its own its not enough to make a car game, but when its combined with a very satisfying feeling of driving you have a potential monster hit.\n\nIn a word, what we have here is the beauty of mathematics, cutting edge in all its glory, put to use to smash things up.  It's fantastic, rewarding, enormous fun to drive, and best of all utterly convincing.  I've crashed enough in this game to know that you don't want to fishtail and clip the rear of your car if you're going to crash in real life because the loss of control is horrendous (as in how a certain English ex-Princess met her fate).  You stand a far better chance of survival just going head on with an object despite the g-forces (with a seatbelt, of course.)\n\nTrust me, the first time you crash a car in this game, the sense of emotional trauma in the silence that follows is palpable.\n\nSo there it is.  A few cars, some nice locations, and nothing to do.  All dressed up and nowhere to go.  I'm not even sure that anyone knows exactly how it will all end up when it finally becomes a game.  There are experiments with car chases, and there's always the prospect of multiplayer, but frankly it doesn't lend itself to the usual genres of car games.  You just have to buy it on faith at the moment, but its still immensely enjoyable.\n\nCrazikyle points out that there are lots of MODs available right now and for many people this is a deal breaker.  I'm no expert on MODs, so by all means anyone who has some to recommend should add them to the bottom of the review in the comments section.  I want to make this review as helpful as possible, and if you folks can help do that by contributing suggestions then please go right ahead and do so.\n\nOne more thought to leave you with: I've played some excellent racing games including iRacer, Project Cars, Assetto Corsa, etc.  None of them feel like you are driving an organic, real-world machine quite the way that BeamNG does.  The cars in BeamNG are made of assembled pieces, and the pieces shake and rattle and bounce under the torque and forces just like a real car.  Other developers  'pretend' their cars are real by suggesting movement and bounce, but only BeamNG has the sense that you have a real, honest-to-God vehicle glued to your throttle pedal.\n\nIf that isn't enough to pique your interest, may I suggest a nice game of Scrabble?","October 12, 2015","true","28.9"," 97 of 105 people (92%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","92","97","105","17","3"

The damage physics, the way the suspension moves, the way the body rolls with bumps is just amazing. This game has the best soft-body physics I've seen in any game. When I really fell in love with the game, as you can see in the above video, is when I hooked my Logitech G27 up to it. Wow! The off-road handling is fantastic with a wheel. In my mind, this game is the spiritual successor to the original 1nsane. Of course it doesn't have any of the game modes (it is in alpha) but I've never had this much fun driving off road in a game before. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes driving off-road, and has an FFB wheel laying around. You dont need a G27 to enjoy the game, even a $50 Driving Force Pro would work great with it.\n\nIn addition to all the above, the game has a strong, and quickly growing mod community. The first video I have listed below uses a Crown Vic police car mod that I downloaded from the official game forums.\nhttps://youtu.be/wAx8tAqG4y4\nThe next video shows all the officially supported vehicles in the game, and the mods available for them.\nhttps://youtu.be/_xzPXYZn_y8\nSo if you don't have the game yet, you owe it to yourself to check it out!","June 20, 2015","true","7.5"," 117 of 133 people (88%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","88","117","133","23","14"

DO IT.\n\nThis is the game I've dreamed about as a destructive child, a simple child, melting my match box cars with gasoline. I grew up playing with Crash Test Dummies. I've played every system since Atari. I have waited decades for a game like this. Bunout series, Destruction Derby series, Vigilante 8 series, Route 66, and "Next Car Game,"- Nothing compares to this. Yes, I know those games are different genres, but nontheless... You know what? Maybe I am overzealous. Or maybe, just maybe, this is what I've been waiting on for my whole gaming life. All I can say is, if this game wasn't touched again by developers, if this was the final product: I'd pay $100 for it. I may trade my Xbox One for it (Rare Replay included).  I was uneasy purchasing the early access but BeamNG.drive called out to me, I could not wait, and the positive reviews after the update were the final straw. I am 31 years old. Thirty one people. I may be too old to get one off when VR porn comes into full futrition, but at least I can say, I have experienced my gaming destiny: BeamNG.drive.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/haydztheweeb/recommended/284160/","haydztheweeb","Haydz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/haydztheweeb/","39 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPerfect game for any car fan, regardless of age.\n\nThere's not a whole lot of fancy graphics, no lens flares, relatively simple smoke/dust effects, most foliage (except trees) are made of flat textures (which are pretty well done, you can't really tell unless you stop and zoom right in on the grass, looks fine if you're driving even at low speeds), and the shaders aren't modified to give a 'cinematic look'. So this game isn't an astonishingly pretty game. But you know what, that's okay.\n\nEach vehicle is intricately modelled, down to the point where you can see each individual part of the engine. You can see the butterfly valves on your supercharged V8 muscle car, you can see the engine block move around in its mounts slightly as you rev the engine. The level of detail is insane. Hit a harsh bump that bottoms out your custom, lowered car? Be prepared to potentially have your entire exhaust system ripped out of your car. Hit a sharp kerb at high speed? Might wanna watch your tires, they can pop, giving your car an unnatural feel. The physical damage in this game is brutally realistic, as each car is not 'hard-coded' with performance stats, health points, etc. Each INDIVIDUAL PART of a car makes up it's whole performance, much like a real car. Pop your front-right tire, and your car will start veering slightly to the right. Fit sport tires, you might be able to handle a corner slightly faster. Lower your suspension, you'll reduce body rolls and keep all 4 tires on the road better, resulting in better grip.\nIt goes on and on. The soft-body physics overall are brilliant, the cars crumple, wobble, and react exactly how you'd expect a car to react.\n\nMaps:\n\nThe maps that come with the game are very nice, and quite varied.\nGridmap: A testing map, with an assortment of jumps, surface types (from sand and dirt to mud and water), slalom cones, objects to crash into and a few high-speed race courses.\n\nPort: A small map set on a port, a perfect map for Gymkhana or drifting fans, with all kinds of shipping containers, warehouses, and a few ramps along with it.\n\nIndustrial Site: A medium sized map set on a seaside industrial area, it features a RallyCross track with multiple configurations, an offroad racing track laced with thick mud that will bog down your average rally car, but take a big 4x4 and you'll plow straight on through, and a more traditional tarmac race course. The industrial area also features many warehouses like the Port map, and a nice little circuit that races around it, featuring a jump over a small inlet.\n\nEast Coast USA: Set in the East Coast of the USA (As the nae suggests), it has a medium-sized town, along with fairly well maintained roads, that go from the coast to snaking through the forest. Lots of dirt trails through fields and woodlands for rallying around too.\n\nJungle Rock Island: On a Tropical Island, this map has poorly-maintained roads that call for terrifying high-speed driving along the coastline of this island. It also has many offroad dirt trails that run through the forest, and can quite easily end up getting you lost! There's also a few little rally trails, and industrial areas, quarries, and a port. Probably my favourite map.\n\nCliff: Spawns you in at the top of a cliff, the only way around is down the cliff. Fun little map for just throwing stuff of cliffs and watching it arrive at the bottom as a mangled mess. Not much to the map other than that, but still fun nonetheless.\n\nHirochi Raceway: A race-focused map, this raceway is GP-styled, with very wide, smooth corners, along with fast straights and chicanes thrown in. This map also has a few forest routes, that can take you on a narrow road through some forests, so any mistakes can be fatal.So, quite a few maps, with lots of variety.\n\nScenarios\n\nThe game has a wide variety of scenarios, too many to list here, that cover multiple fun aspects of the game.\n\nThese can range from tutorials, to shakedowns of various cars, police chases, races, delivery challenges, even a 'hyper-miling' challenge where you have to cross Jungle Rock Island with very little gas left in your car. There's even a demolition derby scenario for people to 'party play'.\n\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a 8/10, I'd like to see networked multiplayer (something the BeamNG devs might implement if their engine can support it) and a campaign mode (which the devs have planned pretty much since day 1 of the project)\n\nLots more potential, the modding community is great, who make new maps, scenarios, vehicles, etc, etc.\n\nDefinitely worth the buy, especially for car fans, IMO.","January 29","true","109.7"," 64 of 67 people (96%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","96","64","67","10","0"

(In my opinion.)\nEverything looks really amazing and that was the first thing i noticed about the game that made me want to try it.\nNot only the roads, but even the tree's a looking amazing. What appeals to me most is the car detail!\nFor example the car interior, engine, and everything else looks really amazing,.\naAnd let’s not forget about the damage that can be done to your car!\nIf you crash into a tree, your car’s hood folds like a piece of paper.\nI think they did a really great job with this aspect of the game!\nThe onOnly thing I think is annoying sometimes: with a small crash even when there isn’t any huge physical damage, your car can get stuck and not be moved / driven.\n\n\nControls:\n=======\nI played the game with my keayboard as well as my Xbox 360 Wireless controller.\nI can recommend the controller because you have more feeling with it.\nFor example, make sure to remember that  when you take a turn, sometimes your car brakes out and with a controller it is much easier to control and recover the car.\nI'm happy with the dev's choice for controller support because many games I play in early access does not support this.\nThe cars feltels really weird in the beginning when I played the game, only after some time did I get used to it.\nEvery car feels slightly different, which and still makes it fun to play and try every car that I can choosice from.\nThey did a really good job with the different roads, likeand I mean is whean you go offroad racing.\n\n\nMultiplayer:\n=========\nStill this is a early access game, but there are some crazy co-op local co-op things to do.\nLike destructiiton derby, that is a lot of fune to play with up to 4 players local.\nI hope the Dev's can add online multiplayer modesmode to this, so we can all drive all together!.\n\n\nOverall:\n======\nThis a really fun and well madegood and fun Car simulator where  you can have hours of fun!.\nTheGame game wais only released infrom 2015 and there are allready so many community mods we can try out!.\nIt's a nice project with very much potential to it.... so Dev's keep up the good work.\n\nI give this Simulator a 9/10 score.\nA job well done !!\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/284160\n\n\n== For more reviews go to www.gamegrin.com ==\n== Please don't forget to like my reviews ==","January 6","true","11.9"," 61 of 69 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","61","69","4","8"

In most vehicle games, damage is a scripted event that takes place when certain parameters are met. In BeamNG, every movement has an effect, causing the body and chassis to flex and twist even under normal driving. Currently I would not exactly call it a game that you can "play", but more of a "playground" for physics enthusiasts, vehicle enthusiasts, or modders who wish to create their own content.\n\nI would not recommend this game to absolutely everyone, but I definitely recommend it to anyone who is into simulation and/or modding.","July 18, 2015","true","10.0"," 58 of 66 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","58","66","2","0"

A rough estimate is around 400 hours.\n\nThe game is good if you are in to soft body physics type of games. (like rigs of rods)\n\nPROs:\nThere is constant updates that add new vehicles, maps, a few bug fixes and stuff like that.\nIt is a fun game to play if you have a few hours to spare or you just want to play something different for a change.\nThe community is great for this game, with lots of people making maps[www.beamng.com] and mods[www.beamng.com] for the game. (never download stuff from modsgaming.ru viruses and stuff linger in mods)\nThe crashing of cars is great and the handling is good.\nGame does not crash very often (once in every 6 months or so) unlike some other soft body physics games.\n\nCONs:\nYou need a good PC to run this. (good cpu, gpu e.t.c)\nSometimes vehicle crashes can be glitchy and will make the vehicle crash (as in freeze type of crash)\nThe price: Its £18.99 which is a bit much for a game in early acess IMO. Its better then Wreckfest but still a bit much for my liking. I got the game for £10 or so when it had to be bought from the website which is a reasonable price for a game in early acess.\nmodsgaming.ru thats all I need to say.\n\nConclusion:\nThe game is a good game to kill a few hours with and has hours upon hours worth of content when you download mods.\nRecommended\n8/10","August 14, 2015","true","82.6"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","40","43","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/boxfresh99/recommended/284160/","boxfresh99","Active Directory","http://steamcommunity.com/id/boxfresh99/","43 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is absolutely fabulous.\n\nI've played it ever since it came out, about 2 years ago in August. The very first version was completely different to what it is now but it has evolved a heck of a lot since then and it's fantastic to see. The game works fantastically and provides us with a very accurate simulation of vehicular physics, as well as free objects too such as walls, tires, wheels etc.\n\nThis game doesn't have an objective, yet. However, if you were to play it, you'd immediately find yourself crashing cars in numerous different ways. Into other cars, through other cars, using the AI, throwing them from a cliff... The list goes on.\n\nThe actual game itself is fantastic. It looks good and it feels good. The UI is friendly, simple and professional. It looks great and it works great. It's not something which will leave you feeling confused.\n\nThere are lots of levels, open world levels, testing arenas, blank spaces and hilltops plus there is an entire modding community dedicated to making new, exciting terrains for us to use. The terrains look great, they're very well detailed and are huge! You won't be cramped here.\n\nVehicles are a complete masterpiece. The original vehicles have a ton of detail and look incredible. Every single individual component in every vehicle is distinguished. You can see every strut, spring and shock absorber. When you aim the camera at the bottom of the vehicle, you will see the suspension arms and axles moving accordingly. You can see the leaf springs compressing and bumping against the bump stops. You can see all of this happening, in a game. The vehicles themselves are charismatic and each have their own unique handling characteristics from a small hatchback to a full on, mid-engined supercar. Or, you can drive a dual axle tractor unit. The list honestly is endless, as well as mods too. You won't find yourself short of vehicles to try. Each vehicle is individually customisable down to every last part. Do you want your car to only have a right door and no glass? No problem. Do you want your box truck to have engine tuning and 4WD? No problem. Do you want your pickup truck lowered to the ground and drifting? No problem! You can do it all.\n\nFinally, the game LOOKS incredible. Apparently, emphasis hasn't been put on to the graphics however if this is Beamng not trying, then they must be able!\n\nDon't be put off by the game's early access title. You may run in to some small bugs however their constant updates will make sure your gaming experience is fine. The game can crash, it can give you some painful times but they're not something that happens that often. Not in my experience and not in many other's either.\n\nI highly recommend this game, it's worth every penny.\n\n","May 31, 2015","true","251.2"," 54 of 66 people (82%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","82","54","66","6","0"

It is boring if your not creative, but fun if you are. Make sure to download mods for the game off the official BeamNG.drive fourm, to make the game even better! I do reccomend a very powerful gaming computer to run this game, or you will only be able to use 1-2 cars at once. The realisim in this game is overwhelimg. It is very fun to test out scenes from movies, and see if they are possible. Also in this game you can program AI so you can have police chases and stuff. The conrolls are weird, I reccomend using a mouse if you have a laptop (like myself).\n\nAnyways I highly reccomend this game to people who love cars, or just wants to destroy them.\n\nOh yea and PS I just learned how to do this the other day, go into options and find something called "dynamic reflection" if you enable it, it makes the game look 10 times better.\n\nOK So Summary: Great fun car/physics simulator. The car damage is very realilistic.

I'm very picky with car games, especially ones centered around carnage. Beam.NG, is in my opinion one of (if not the best) soft-body car physics sandbox games out there. The damage portrayed is pretty darn close to the real thing. While it's not perfect it's as close as 2014 technology can really let us experience. Since it's still in Alpha, scratches and rubs don't appear on the side of the cars, but I certainly hope they will when the game is finished. However, while the damage modeling is wonderful, as far as a driving experience, BeamNG.drive doesn't deliver. If you want tight, accurate and realistic car control, look elsewhere. As of (Aug. 14 '14) BeamNG.drive isn't great to drive. The controls are sort of laggy, rear-wheel drive vehicles are near impossible to drive and the standard transmision is rather awkward. That being said, this game is still in developement, and I certainly recomend picking it up. As is, demolition derbies are sort of possible, but just messing around is tons of fun. I certainly enjoy it, and I want this game to become fully polished, so buy it and help it become the perfect driving simulator sandbox thing.","August 14, 2014","true","89.7"," 73 of 101 people (72%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","72","73","101","12","0"

Mods like vehicles, aircraft, maps, props etc. created by the community at the game's forums.\n+Pretty good visuals (some cons though) Supports up to 4K resolution (to my knowledege)\n+Full controller support\n+Local multiplayer (like old school Gran Turismo same screen multiplayer)\n+In-Game terrain editor.\n\nCons:\n-Sounds (the team is working on this as a current primary objective. I will change this when new sounds are in the game)\n-Gameplay aspects lacking. Scenarios are available but are quickly played.\n-The lighting visuals seem really weird to me. Headlights are useless at night. I recently saw a quote that said that "the headlights are as bright as the sun with a cutoff" proving that there is a lighting issue.\n-? The force feedback feels weird; it could be that I don't have it set right but bumps feel rather numb.\n+/-Requires a rather good computer to handle (unless you turn off collsion between vehicles)\n\nNarrative\nPros\n\nThis is a very good simulator in it's current state. There are not many game aspects to it yet but you have some scenarios given to you such as races or delivery missions. Despite limited concrete gameplay, this is very attractive because, in freeplay, you have total freedom to explore any map you have (official or third-party) in any vehicle you want (official or third-party).\n\nAs of this writing (12/30/15), updates are becoming quite rapid fire with loads of new content in each.  From the launch of the game in August, 2013 to just about a year ago, you could tell that the team was struggling; updates took, in the shortest times, 3 to 4 months with mainly "improvements to physics" and little to no content additions. However, for the past six months or so, as the team has expanded with several new, talented members, every update has included a new official vehicle, bugs that the community have reported have been hit head-on, and the team's blog and other official information from the team has been clearly given and is more interactive than ever before. I have a feeling that Beta stage is almost here (currently the game is in Alpha)\n\nMoving on, the game comes with a built-in terrain editor. I have experience modding the game via the built-in terrain editor, it is capable and very easy to learn even just by trial and error.\n\nThe community is vibrant and boasts hundreds of mods, be them vehicles such as cars, trucks, aircraft, etc., maps, utilites, and other etc modifications. I highly recommend this game be used with a good steering wheel and pedal setup (my personal bias is towards the Logitech series of wheels).\n\nCons\n\nPutting the fact that better sounds are being made for the game all around, in their current state, the sounds are mostly lacking excitement. I concede that they have gotten miles better in recent months to include recently new unique sounds for one of the vehicles and most recently suspension sounds.\n\nAs I said above, "gameplay" aspects are lacking. There are scenarios but that is it. The team has goals of adding a career mode but it hasn't been said when yet.\n\nThis is probably personal but I feel that the force feedback system could be better.\n\nThat's all I got :)\n\nPersonal notes:\n\nKeep your performance in mind. The game IS VERY CPU heavy, not so much GPU heavy. Keep that in mind. I may go so far as to say that anything older than 5 years old will not play over 30 FPS; anything under 3.0GHz will not play over 30FPS (with collisions on). My 6 year old 2.3GHz gets me 10-15 FPS with collisions on, ~25-35FPS with them off.\n\nOverall:\n9.5/10 from me; the updates are very intriguing these days! The game truly gets better with every update.","December 30, 2015","true","313.5"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","29","30","3","0"

There is not a huge variety of cars but a very large variety of variations for the cars. You do need a good computer to get a good frame rate but in slow motion it works just fine. The physics are very well desinged and it feels like it's not an early access game. Crashing the cars is very satifying but you can also change the cars appearance and performance.

Then this game is the game for you! This game is for those people who want to see cars crashed exactly the way they want but can't afford to do that in real life. Basically, this game was made for Americans and terrorists.\n\nOn a more serious note, I would like to mention that at the moment, it includes:\nA sandbox mode where you can play around in many default maps, and many player-created maps,\nA map editor which you can access by pressing F11 while not in full screen mode (Alt+Enter toggles fullscreen),\nA Scenario system where you can play scenarios made by both the developers and modders on both stock and user-created maps,\nController, joystick, and steering wheel support with a very easy-to-use interface for mapping the controls.Remember, this game is still in Early Access and features are being added to it all the time. In the menu, it's obvious that there are plans for a campaign mode. That'll be fun. Don't forget to Subscribe, leave a nice comment, and enjoy some of my other videos!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a developer of this game, nor am I aassociated with the developers, I likely missed some important features of the game.

Things like cars having incredible shock absorbers when landing jumps is not present here. There's no magical forces like in other simulations and cars respond properly to impacts and hard landings. Miles beyond Nextcargame. This is at the cost of CPU performance. You NEED a good CPU for this game. your graphics card doesn't matter so much yet\n\nThere are a few things to be aware of; it is an alpha with few features and many bugs present. Currently there's no game as such. Just a way to play with the physics engine. Tire models aren't up to scratch yet so while driving is realistic(ish) all vehicles handle very lazily with a kind of unavoidable floatiness. There isn't a massive quantity of content either. What there is, however, is fun to play with.\n\nIf you want a physics sandbox then buy it now. If you want a driving simulator then wait for it to become one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/59er/recommended/284160/","59er","Julianos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/59er/","257 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPerfect game for any car fan, regardless of age.\n\nThere's not a whole lot of fancy graphics, no lens flares, relatively simple smoke/dust effects, most foliage (except trees) are made of flat textures (which are pretty well done, you can't really tell unless you stop and zoom right in on the grass, looks fine if you're driving even at low speeds), and the shaders aren't modified to give a 'cinematic look'. So this game isn't an astonishingly pretty game. But you know what, that's okay.\n\nEach vehicle is intricately modelled, down to the point where you can see each individual part of the engine. You can see the butterfly valves on your supercharged V8 muscle car, you can see the engine block move around in its mounts slightly as you rev the engine. The level of detail is insane. Hit a harsh bump that bottoms out your custom, lowered car? Be prepared to potentially have your entire exhaust system ripped out of your car. Hit a sharp kerb at high speed? Might wanna watch your tires, they can pop, giving your car an unnatural feel. The physical damage in this game is brutally realistic, as each car is not 'hard-coded' with performance stats, health points, etc. Each INDIVIDUAL PART of a car makes up it's whole performance, much like a real car. Pop your front-right tire, and your car will start veering slightly to the right. Fit sport tires, you might be able to handle a corner slightly faster. Lower your suspension, you'll reduce body rolls and keep all 4 tires on the road better, resulting in better grip.\nIt goes on and on. The soft-body physics overall are brilliant, the cars crumple, wobble, and react exactly how you'd expect a car to react.\n\nMaps:\n\nThe maps that come with the game are very nice, and quite varied.\nGridmap: A testing map, with an assortment of jumps, surface types (from sand and dirt to mud and water), slalom cones, objects to crash into and a few high-speed race courses.\n\nPort: A small map set on a port, a perfect map for Gymkhana or drifting fans, with all kinds of shipping containers, warehouses, and a few ramps along with it.\n\nIndustrial Site: A medium sized map set on a seaside industrial area, it features a RallyCross track with multiple configurations, an offroad racing track laced with thick mud that will bog down your average rally car, but take a big 4x4 and you'll plow straight on through, and a more traditional tarmac race course. The industrial area also features many warehouses like the Port map, and a nice little circuit that races around it, featuring a jump over a small inlet.\n\nEast Coast USA: Set in the East Coast of the USA (As the nae suggests), it has a medium-sized town, along with fairly well maintained roads, that go from the coast to snaking through the forest. Lots of dirt trails through fields and woodlands for rallying around too.\n\nJungle Rock Island: On a Tropical Island, this map has poorly-maintained roads that call for terrifying high-speed driving along the coastline of this island. It also has many offroad dirt trails that run through the forest, and can quite easily end up getting you lost! There's also a few little rally trails, and industrial areas, quarries, and a port. Probably my favourite map.\n\nCliff: Spawns you in at the top of a cliff, the only way around is down the cliff. Fun little map for just throwing stuff of cliffs and watching it arrive at the bottom as a mangled mess. Not much to the map other than that, but still fun nonetheless.\n\nHirochi Raceway: A race-focused map, this raceway is GP-styled, with very wide, smooth corners, along with fast straights and chicanes thrown in. This map also has a few forest routes, that can take you on a narrow road through some forests, so any mistakes can be fatal.\nSo, quite a few maps, with lots of variety.\n\nScenarios\n\nThe game has a wide variety of scenarios, too many to list here, that cover multiple fun aspects of the game.\n\nThese can range from tutorials, to shakedowns of various cars, police chases, races, delivery challenges, even a 'hyper-miling' challenge where you have to cross Jungle Rock Island with very little gas left in your car. There's even a demolition derby scenario for people to 'party play'.\n\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a 8/10, I'd like to see networked multiplayer (something the BeamNG devs might implement if their engine can support it) and a campaign mode (which the devs have planned pretty much since day 1 of the project)\n\nLots more potential, the modding community is great, who make new maps, scenarios, vehicles, etc, etc.\n\nDefinitely worth the buy, especially for car fans, IMO.","February 27","true","242.4"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","21","22","3","2"

If you're looking for the next racing game, this isn't it. This is a whole new, and amazing simulator. This game features real time deformation of the cars, with real time simulated car physics. Every crash will be different, every jump will land differently. This game, sorry, simulator, will keep you entertained for hours, if not days. You will constantly find yourself driving into walls, over and over, purely because each time you do, it'll yeild a different result, especially with the option of slowing down time to watch your precious sports car crumple and destroy itself. This simulator is constantly being updated and has a steady flow of work being put into it, the creators constanly update the players as to what their working on and what to expect in future updates. The price it's going for now is a bargain, especially as its supposed to increase in price as time goes on. Did I mention that there is planned to be a multiplayer feature? As if smashing into walls and sliding off roads into trees wasn't fun enough by yourself, you'll be able to destroy your friends' cars as well?

This game PERFECTLY simulates real-life physics. There's so many things to do, and you can do anything you want. There's missions, tons of maps, and not to mention a huge selection of modded cars and custom maps. You can even go into the files of a certain car and give it 3000 horsepower if you really wanted to. They are constantly adding new things, and fixing all of the bugs. The customization level is ridiculous. You can drive around with only a frame, wheels, and your engine. Who needs a car body? You can tune your suspension, throw on a supercharger, and much more. I highly recommend this game if you enjoy tinkering with things, or even just driving. NOTE: It will take some getting used to, because the handling is realistic to real life.

You got me there.\n\nFor reference, this is a car physics simulation game with some of the most true-to-life physics you can get.\n\nAnyway, back to the name. "Beam" refers to how the physics are simulated. The physics part of your car is built out of "beam," these invisible lines that make the physical mesh of your vehicle. They can break, which is where the damage starts to occur. They don't show it in any videos above, but it's definitely a fresh take on physics.\n\nLike I said, "NG?"\n\n"Drive," on the other hand, is self-explanatory.\n\nGive this game a try. I'll be honest, the sound effects are basically worse than gargling broken glass (idk), and the visual look of many of the cars can make you gag (i.e the in-game Volkswagen Golf). If you're like me, you overlook those facts and say "OMG THE PHYSICS," unless you aren't a complete geek/nerd.\n\nYes, buy this game. It's 25 bucks here, but look on their website!

It is not graphics intensive, but you need a lot of RAM to run it smoothly. Because it employs soft-body collision dynamics, it is capable of producing unimagineably realistic, *ahem* "accidents". driving faster than 70 mph puts you in a bit of a bind, as the slightest turn puts you at risk of a nasty crash. A little side-game can be derived from these low friction coefficients that are prevalent throughout the game, known simply as "The BeamNG Challenge". simply pick a map, pick a car, and try to stay above 75 mph. it's insanely fun and difficult, and a great way to challenge your friends that are a little bit too tired of playing Rocket League with you. This challenge is just one of so very many things you can do in this game.\n\nAll in All, BeamNG is perfect for just farting around with physics and cars.","October 6, 2015","true","21.1"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","20","23","3","0"

What makes this game so great?\n\nMyself: Three words. Soft. Body. Physics.\n\nMe: Soft body physics? Can you elaborate?\n\nMyself: Realistic and unlimited vehicle body deformation. More than any game before it. Before BeamNG there was Rigs of Rods. Burnout 3: Takedown has the best vehicular damage in the Burnout series. But that game did not simulate every component of the vehicle. Carmagedon, Dirt, Grid, Flatout and Crashtime all have pretty amazing vehicle physics. BNG is just leaps and bounds ahead of everyone.\n\nMe: Would you recommend the game, even in the early access state?\n\nMyself: Absolutely yes! If your PC can handle it. This is probably the only thing holding the game back. The game is still a work in progress so at times the game runs great, other times not so much. There is a mod community already making vehicles for the game. These can be hit and miss as different versions of the game come out compatiblity changes. So if you find a car that just falls apart you might have to uninstall that mod. The developer content in the game is great so far. Constantly adding new vehicles, maps and scenarios to play. I just love to load up a map and play around with the many vehicle types. It's essentially a physics playground of vehiclular vehicle slaughter.\n\nMe: Wow! that is a lot to take in. Hopefully this answered some questions for the community looking to buy.\n\nMyself: Well if you want you can swing over to my profile page and check out some of the screenshots that I took in game.\n\nMe: Great.

Even in its Alpha phase and total lack of objectivity BeamNG.drive is on point, but has plenty of room for improvement. Although the physics are the most realistic and difficult I have experienced, the wrecks and models could use some work. Getting snagged on a tree causes textures to stretch at times. Some parts of the vehicle are static and do not move when you wreck as well.\n\nBeamNG.drive can be best described as a physics engiune diguised as a driving game.

"Official" cars included with the game destroy and deform for the most part as you'd expect they would (you get minor bugs here and there but this doesn't often happen unless you completely mutilate a vehicle).  The official selection of cars is small--a pickup, a midsize SUV, a full-size sedan, a compact sedan, a compact coupe, a supercar, a full-size coupe, a full-size van and a semi--but they're all very highly detailed and behave as you'd expect them to behave.  In addition to vehicles, there is a wide variety of other machines and devices you can use to destroy vehicles (including a roller crusher, a centrifuge and a car cannon).  The environments provided are again few, but nicely varied and include sections of countryside, small towns, racetracks, industrial areas and more.  The really big pro here?  The game is totally open to the modding community.  There are lots of cars, props and maps available to drive, and they run the gamut from plain family cars to rally specials and science-fiction wonders. The modded terrains range from rally stages to highways to elaborate obstacle courses to who knows what else.  The official terrains are very well designed and pretty, if a bit lifeless.  They're also quite large and have a lot of little secrets hidden all throughout them--secrets that can often only be accessed by a particular type of vehicle.\n\nThe Bad: Despite being in production for well over a year, the game is still in a very early state.  There are lots of features still missing (there is no multiplayer, AI is primitive at best).  And then there's the other problem--this game is a MASSIVE resource hog.  All the physics calculations are done in real time.  There are ZERO canned crash animations, unlike a game like GTAV.  GTA uses canned animations to save on CPU overhead and preserve framerate.  Beamng.drive does not.  Because of that you are going to need a very good PC to run this game on high graphics settings and keep a reasonable framerate.  Also, because of the early state of this game there...really isn't all that much to DO.  There are a few "scenarios", basically all time-trial races, but other than these there's no real point besides driving around and figuring out new and inventive ways to destroy a late 90s pedo-van.  Also, this is a car-based driving game with car-based controls.  There are working boats and aircraft in the modding community but the control scheme is not designed to accomodate them.  Because of that they can be very hard to handle.  Another point against--the game works decently well with a gamepad, but to take full advantage of it you are going to need a decent steering wheel and pedal setup.  DO NOT attempt to play this game with just a keyboard and mouse.\n\nSo should you buy this game now?  Well that depends.  Are you the kind of gamer that enjoys driving games?  Can you make your own fun?  Do you like to break stuff?  I'd say if you answered yes to at least two of those three questions, you should give this game a good hard look.  If however you're the kind of gamer that needs direction, needs to be given something to do, this game probably isn't for you.","May 29, 2015","true","193.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

It's amazingly fun to just mess around with, and try to make really interesting crashed happen. This is definitely the most realistic car physics simulator out there, but keep in mind, that's about all it is. The developers have added some fun little missions to do, but they aren't really that good and you don't get any reward or even acknowledgement for beating them, they're sort of just there so the game isn't a complete sandbox. That being said, there is much more in the works, such as multiplayer, racing, and many other fun things that I cannot wait for. This also is a pretty big game, I'd recommend having a good computer to get the game's full effect. (My $200 Toshiba isn't exactly doing it for me) There are truly some amazing mods, including actual makes and models (ex. Ford Crown Vic, Ferrari F50, etc.) and even rocket cars and planes. They are up there with the stock cars the developers put out, work just as fine, and in my experience, have no extra bugs or glitches. (Though I do have to point out, you would do completely fine without mods because the developers did an truly amazing job putting out a variety of different vehicles, including semis, trucks, drift cars, your everyday sedans, police cars, hyper cars, vans, off-road variants of trucks, and sports cars. Keep in mind though that all of these cars are by fake car companies, so if you are looking for realism, download mods.)\n\nThe other cool thing about BeamNG is that it is super-customizable. You can change the cars, (ex. remove/change parts or switch engines) change the time of day, mess around with the gravity, use slow motion ,(Highly recommened, crashes look awesome in slow motion with the amount of detail in this game) and even add in AI's to chase you around or crash into. This is another fun aspect of this game that I love, and I use the features mentioned above a lot.\n\nMinor problems I have with the game:\n\n-Engine sounds. Most of the engine sounds that are in the stock cars the game comes with are the same, which can be sort of disappointing to a car guy. You do get some different sounds with modded cars, but you still get mainly one droning engine sound, which doesn't really sound good either.\n\n-Water. In most cars, even the modded ones, going into water that is a little bit bigger than a big puddle on a real road kills the engine. This is really getting nit-picky, but when I try off-roading in a car that wasn't specifically built for it, even on just a bit of water, the engine dies.\n\n-Crash sounds. Almost every single sound of vehicles impacting something is met with the same exact sound. It is a realistic sound, but it gets annoying after a while hearing the same sound over and over when you crash it.\n\n-Lack of actual gameplay. I did already address this, but once again, if you are looking for something other than a sandbox, wait for the game to finish Early Access or go somewhere else, because as of now, this is almost 100% a sandbox.\n\nAlthough there are a few things missing right now, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone with even a slightly better computer than mine and who just wants to mess around with cars and physics for a while. I have so far played this game for 80+ hours (Keep in mind I usually get around 15fps with my computer having -15 gb of ram) and I still have fun every time I open BeamNG. Updates are frequent and usually big, with either bugs fixed or new cars being added just about every time. Definitely buy this game if you want a sandbox, but you should wait a while if looking for real gameplay.

It would be nice to have a few pre-sets I often found steering was difficult in a few cars (and I didn't understand what values/sliders to change to perhaps make it better)\n\n2) This is a really fun 'sandbox' but to me it's not quite a game, if you want to spend your hours crashing cars a lot or zooming around then I'd say go for it. There's a local multi-player mode but if you're like me and you don't have friends in real life that will play with you then ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n\n3) The price is expensive in comparison to what you're getting, just a suggestion but I would say about £10-£12 for this game max and you'd probably find you'd get a lot more sales.\n\nI'll come back to this game in the future and just have another looksie and see if these points mentioned have been addressed in a way.

I bought the alpha early on, about a year ago, and I'm still having fun with it now. If you like the physicsy simulationy type of sandbox game you'll definitely be impressed with BeamNG.drive and end up messing around with it for a long time (and that's not including the wide variety of mods available)!\n\nThere's a racing mode and other new features coming out soon, and I hope they turn out as well as everything else.\n\nRegarding Next Car Game, NCG is more of a desruction derby focusing on wide areas and chunks of destruction with a ton of broken pieces flying around; it's more of an action-orientated game. BeamNG.drive is a realistic physics simulator sandbox. NCG and BeamNG.drive are both good at doing what they are designed to do, but in my view they're pretty different.\n\nTL;DR reviewy thing:\nCrash Physics: The physics are extremely realistic and efficient with minimal glitching; every crash inflicts different and varying amounts of damage upon each vehicle.\nCar Detail: The cars are detailed in terms of aesthetics (the detail of the exterior and interior of the vehicles) and mechanics (wheel torque, suspension, chassis integrity) with results extremely similar to their real-world counterparts.\nGraphics and Sound: The graphics are decent with no visual effect bugging as of now. The sound works for what it is but isn't made all that well; a sound overhaul is planned.\nMods: The mods are plenty and great, very high quality. You can pilot airplanes and do the coolest trix.\nControls: There are many controls and it is sometimes hard to press all the buttons needed to control vehicles. Vehicles can sometimes feel sticky or slippery.\n\n\nFor those who are willing to take upon themselves the challenge of reading a huge block of text:\n\nSummary:\nBeamNG.drive is one of the most realistic car physics/damage simulators up to date. Utilizing a real-time soft-body physics engine powered by Torque3D, it successfully emulates breakable and malleable surfaces applied to cars. The physics demonstration that BeamNG.drive is capable of is nearly identical to real-world movement; footage of in-game crashes have been compared to real-world test crashes with minimal differences.\n\nReviewy thing:\nCrash Physics: It's amazing how the physics are simulated, with every surface on every car bending and breaking differently in every situation (surfaces are warped in accordance to the surfaces they come in contact with resulting in unique damage, rather than calling up a stored "damage model" when a car hits something a la GTA car physics or the such). This is where the "Beam" of BeamNG.drive comes in. I'm not that knowledgeable about the details of the physics simulating but it can be thought of like a detailed, intricate grid on a surface with each point moving when it hits something. I have not encountered many bugs in the physics so far, but if pushed far beyond real-world limits the physics do cause model glitches. Sometimes meshes and textures will crumple and stretch weirdly after paricularly intensive crashes. For what it is, however, it works wonderfully and efficiently, even able to be run on a medium-powered laptop with some lag spikes only during intensive car mangling.\n\nCar Detail: Each car is crafted with a keen eye to their details; the mechanics of a vehicle and the aesthetics are both represented. Each car has its unique statistics, with varying engine types, suspension, handling, and et cetera. The handling can even be changed, with options for a sportscar-like experience, offroad handling, and other presets. (The actual in-game control handling can be changed as well, ranging from an arcade control scheme seen in most car games to a full, realistic "driver's seat" experience. However, as of now the control is sort of lackluster with a keyboard since the left and right keys make the steering wheel turn all the way to either side; the cars sometimes feel sticky or slippery.) The detailed aesthetics can also be changed, as the cars are modular and can have parts added and removed. This also ties in with the modding capabilities of the game, which I will get into in a bit. Because of all of the attention paid to making everything as realistic as possible, the seven vanilla cars each have their own unique feel and excel at different tasks (again much like their real-world counterparts).\n\nGraphics and Sound: In my opinion, there's not much to say about this aspect currently since the focus of BeamNG.drive is realistic physics simulation. The graphics are decent and look great when maxed out, but they're nothing special currently (as you can probably see in the trailer and screenshots). There are some post effects which help to smooth everything out a bit, and there are a spattering of particles here and there. The particles do add a lot of effect when used correctly in screenshots and cinematics. The camera following sometimes goes through the ground if a car is tumbling or spinning but overall works as it should, providing smooth views of third-person and first-person views (although there's no model actually driving the cars). That covers the basic graphics system, I think. The sound isn't as good as everything else, but it is clear and works its part. The engine sounds, tire screeches, and et cetera are the same in every situation on every car but the actual sound clips are clear and concise. In slow motion the sounds run in realtime and are very loud, but other than that I can't think of anything too jarring. There is some ambience as well, and it is decent. The developers are planning a sound overhaul, however, so I am looking forwards to that.\n\nMods: The modding capabilities really expand the possibilities of BeamNG.drive, with more detailed vehicles, intricate maps, other fun and interesting mods. There are many high quality mods that have qualities comparable to the actual game. One of the most well-known modders on the BeamNG forums, DrowsySam, has even helped the devs with some things. Of course, as mods, they aren't completely perfect but as I said, most of them are top notch. There are even mods for planes, and althought the physics for those aren't as realistic and smooth as the car physics, they're still pretty awesome (the devs haven't had air travel possibilities in their mids yet so hopefully you can see how cool that is), I'm also not going to say too much about this, since you really just have to install some mods to get a sense of what they can do.\n\nControls: The controls are a bit weird, with the arrow keys controlling vehicles, the numpad and a right-click-and-hold controlling the camera, and various other key combinations for respawning, changing gears (in manual control mode), switching vehicles, and activating slow motion to list a few of the commonly used commands. It works, but sometimes it is hard to access multiple commands, for example, when trying to record something (movement, camera angle, and slow motion for example).\n\nEDIT: Formatting and added something about Next Car Game.","August 13, 2014","true","151.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

But this is only a sideline compared to free-roaming the maps in various iterations of a modest but broad selection of very well modelled vehicles.\n\nIf the future GTAs, Project Cars or similar can wrangle this kind of powerful physics then the future is bright for ultra-realistic, satisfying vehicular gameplay.\n\nYou shouldn't be turned off by the Early Access nature of the game. The level which the game is at currently IS worth £19 in my opinion. However this might seem steep to anyone who prefers a story-lead game with a much more led set of scenarios.\n\n\n\n8/10 - If the updates stay regular, WELL worth it.","January 27","true","9.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's only single player right now and hopefully multiplayer will be added around final release.  The physics can get a bit wonky and things will fall off your vehicle from no stress at all nearly. When you get stuck inside something, there is a reset button for your vehicle and it's great but if your stuck between a prop and a wall, it sometimes won't work. If you like realistic cars this game is for you, but you need a good computer to run it.  it's early access so things are supposed to happen that will be fixed like bushes acting as invincible blocks that can destroy your vehicle to shreds and invincible trees acting as spider web when you drive into them too fast.","July 21, 2015","true","1.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nickorator/recommended/284160/","Nickorator","Nickorator","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nickorator/","75 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI don't usually write reviews... ever actually. But I feel this game can't go without one. I've been playing this game since September of 2013 and it simply never gets old. There is a lot of talk about there not being much gameplay yet, which is partially true. It doesn't have a story mode or a campaign, (Not yet at least) but to be honest it doesn't need to. The normal sandbox mode is endless entertainment, and with the new addition of 'Scenarios', (Time trials and timed challenges) there is more playable content than ever. The scenarios are actually quite difficult and it will surely take many hours to complete them all. And on top of that, you can share your times with members on the forum to be put on a leaderboard. Aside from the scenarios though, it's really a game meant for imagination and experimentation. Just thinking of every way possible to wreck any car I want leaves endless possibilities. As a kid who grew up on racing games, I've always dreamed of a game where every action you have has an equal reaction. One where you actually have to drive carefully in order to succeed. And that's exactly what BeamNG is. You can spend endless hours on this game whether you're crashing cars, flying planes, (And even sailing ships, soon) offroading, stunting, and even content creating with the excellent mod support this game has. It may get boring after an hour or two of just driving around and exploring, but for some reason I always keep coming back to it. I'll admit, it's not for everyone. It requires patience, imagination, and a curious mind. But honestly, if you've ever been interested in doing outrageous things with vehicles that you could never do in real life, than this is the game you need to get. It offers a ridiculous number of possibilities with real-life outcomes. It's truly the most realistic driving game I've ever played.\n\nPros:Insanely beautiful graphics.\nLifelike soft-body physics.\nEnough maps, cars, and objects to keep you entertained for days.\nMultiple 'Scenarios' where you can test your time and driving skill.\nVery advanced settings so you can set EVERYTHING perfectly.\nCustomizable UI with multiple interesting apps.\nCamera mode for easy, beautiful screenshots.\nExtremely realistic vehicles. The models/textures are nearly exact in every aspect.\nWorking dashboards, gas tanks, lights, and trailers.\nReal-life aerodynamics, time, gravity, and physics.\nCrazy props to destroy your cars with.\nRealistic maps that can take hours to explore.\nTime trials on supported maps\nAmazing forum community.\nEasy mod support from the talented modders on the forum.*\nMods such as planes, boats, offroaders, machines, maps, skins, apps, and more.\nRelatively easy to mod yourself, if you have the time to learn.\nChat room and repository (Soon)\nTRULY regular updates. It's a small team but they really stepped up.\nCons:Takes a decent computer to run well.\nProbably boring if you aren't a little creative.\nCrashes often (But what can you expect when you slam a car into a wall at 300mph in a virtual physics engine that's early access?)\nI don't personally use a racing wheel, but I hear the game has little support for them. I'd look into that more if this applies to you.\nTL;DR\nIf you've ever wanted to see or do anything crazy with a vehicle that you can't do in real life, buy this game. It's one of the most good-looking games I've ever seen, and it's the most realistic physics simulator I've ever seen. If you are at all interested in it, just get it.\n\n*I'd like to make this very clear that I said "on the forum". Never download a mod that wasn't originally posted to the official BeamNG forum. Around the BeamNG community, a few Russian websites have become very well known for publishing false mods. They are simple vehicle models ripped off from somewhere on the internet and then slapped onto the jbeam (The code and skeleton that makes vehicles in this game crash and function) of an existing default vehicle. This results in, for example, a car that looks like a Lamborghini but handles and crashes like a Crown Vic. These mods could have viruses in them, and without a doubt will not function well. If you do insist to download these however, I believe I speak for the community when I say to not publish videos or pictures of them. Like I said, they don't function the way they're meant to and in short, just make the game look bad. I just thought I'd give a fair warning.","May 29, 2015","true","131.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I personally adore sandboxes, just because you can do whatever you want. The fact that you can download mods makes it even better, you are actually encouraged to install mods and expand the possibilities to the max. I don't have a drivers license, so I can't say much about how the verhicles handle in comparison with real ones, however, I know enough about physics to say that it is pretty damn good. For example, when you brake slowly without slipping instead of completely burning your tires, you will actually brake faster because the braking force is higher. When you accelerate when your vehicle is flying through the air, you won't see your actual speed because your tires don't touch the ground. Next to all those details you can also place small apps on the screen that show engine info, like the force from the engine itself, the force from the tires, windspeed, weight, G-force, etc. etc. The game does contain some minor bugs, but because it is still an early access game, I don't mind.\n\nOverall: 7,5/10","December 14, 2015","true","28.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","4","5","4","0"

Soooo I personally don't like reading the big long in depth reviews so I am just gonna put some pros and cons say a few final words and be done.\nPros:\n-Good graphics\n-Pretty good sound fx\n-delicious phisics\n-Lots of fun scenarios (more added frequently and community made scenarios)\n-Lots of player made content\n-Level editor/creator (never used it myself but it's cool that it's there)\n\nCons:\n-You dont need to use the clutch to shift even when in a "fully manual" driving mode.\n-Nearly unplayable on a keyboard (wheel is best, but I put a good 30 of my hours on a gamepad)\n-Not very well optimised (on a normal $450 computer on min graphics I got around 30-40 fps, now I have a great gaming rig and I get a solid 60 fps unless I turn on dynamic reflictions, then I get 40-55 fps)\n-Takes a little while to set up a wheel for it\n-When you get driving it steals hours (I once drove for 4-5 hours straight in the same car on the same map)\n\nBottom line, get the game if you like deystroying things, driving or if you just like cars generally. It's frequntly updated and they are always improving it.\n\nPs, I basically learned to drive manual in this game, even though you don't need the clutch I used it anyway and now I shift gears with clutch without thinking.\n\n10/10 would buy it again.","December 30, 2015","true","84.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That being said, it does it in spectacular form.  Its absolutely hilarious.  At this point, the game is in alpha, which they make very clear going in, so as it is at the time of this writing, there's not a lot of content.  I've also come across a couple of bugs, but its pretty stable as a whole.  There are several maps that are fully explorable, a handful of vehicles with different variations, and some scenarios to play with are available, but it's best to try and make your own fun.  The game supports mods as well, but I haven't been able to get any to work yet.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rkkmatoi/recommended/284160/","rkkmatoi","D.Va","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rkkmatoi/","222 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is definitely one of the best racing games I've ever played.  Its fun, realistic, and creative, thanks to the dedicated mod community and wonderful devs who keep us updated on their website beamng.com/blogs/ with a weekly summary of their work.  I've put at least 20 hours into the game before it came on Steam, and I have no intention of stopping.  This game already has no ceiling to how amazing it can be, and there isn't even any sort of structure to the gameplay.  Its a simple load map, load vehicle, drive to your heart's content affair that is both incredibly relaxing and engagig.  I love making rally courses to run through without wrecking and just running through them over and over.  There is no time limit, no opponents, and no objectives.  Only you, the car, and the road.  The great bit is that each game is a new adventure because there aren't any rules as to where you can and can't go, leaving it up to you to decide how to explore and play with the environment you're given.  And then there is the main selling point of this game: the crash physics.  How the devs did it, I have no idea.  Watching your car get bent in half around a tree after a botched high-speed turn is a sight like no other.  For those of us hell-bent on obliderating our cars, there is a map called "Insane Testing" by Insanegaz on the mod forums featuring spikes, loops, giant stairs, huge drops, high speed cliff races, and all kinds of terrains to smash your vehicle on.\n\nAs well as being a great game to play, it is also a great game to mod.  The world editor can be accessed by pressing F12 in game, and it uses a simple and intuitive UI that makes it easy to create your own content.  On the coding side, everything is done in LUA, which is incredibly simple to learn.  Installing mods is as easy as downloading one from the forums, unzipping the package and dropping the folder into the appopriate directory within the game file ("Levels" for new maps, "Vehicles" for new cars, etc.).\n\nOf course, there are a few problems with the game, but that is to be expected of a private Alpha build.  The engine sound is the same for all cars, and the tire screech is not pleasant either.  There is currently no multiplayer, although I expect that to come eventually.   At the time of writing, the dev team is in the process of crafting a massive update nicknamed the "Race Update" because it is to add a structured race system complete with laps, checkpoints, and working AI (non-player vehicles are currently a feature, and they do have AI, but only "Flee from player" and "Chase player", both of which are tons of fun already).  Some of the controls are a little obtuse (I'm sure they're just placeholders that will be changed by Beta), and there isn't any GUI for customizing your controls.  In fact, you have to find your inputmaps.dae file and manually edit things, which is a little annoying, but not a game-killer.  While the crash physics are amazing, the rest of the graphics fall a little short.  As a whole, the textures are somewhat lifeless and the lighting isn't advanced enough yet to add a solid tonal feel to the game.  BUT, the game isn't anywhere close to being done and I am quite impressed at the quality and sheer amount of fun present in this piece of software.","August 29, 2014","true","22.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

As I played more, I became fascinated at how realistic the driving physics are, despite employing a completely different paradigm to anything else. In the past, i've found physics based titles (not just car games) to have a plethora of silly physics glitches, making them difficult to play or impossible to take seriously. I bought a Thrustmaster T300RS Racing wheel recently, and despite having a dozen other car games in my collection, I find myself coming back to this one. It really shines with a wheel, and you'll find that the force feedback is a unique experience compared to anything else. Oh and the crashes are spectacular of course.\n\nRecommended.\n\nPROS\n+ Surprisingly nice graphics, looks almost raytraced at times\n+ Novel approach to vehicle handling that that is fun but realistic\n+ Industry-leading softbody physics\n+ Good controller support, with support for shifters and clutch pedals. I'm even using an old joystick as a handbrake.\n+ Force feedback for wheels is great when tuned\n+ Mod support; more vehicles, more maps, more fun\n\nCONS\n- Poor performance on a 980 Ti a good bit of the time. 45-50 FPS in a lot of maps.\n- Needs some tweaking to get ingame steering wheels to turn 1:1 with your wheel controller\n- No multiplayer... yet\n\nNEUTRAL\n- VR support better be on the roadmap\n- Steam Workshop would be better than the current mod install system","January 27","true","15.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This aside, let's get on to the real deal here.\nAn absolutely hands-down realistic soft-body driving simulator, most likely more realistic than what you see in drivers training computer systems.  Not only can you shift gears (multiple transmission modes, arcade automatic, real auto, manual, manual with clutch), you can use signals, hazard lights, headlights/highbeams, and the signal stalks and shifter moves as you shift it - gauges work too and if you clobber the car so badly the check-engine light comes on!.  It's extremely well thought-out, and if you ever have played Rig-of-Rods, it's all the fun that was, and way way more fun.\n\nWelcome to the "Garry's Mod" of CARS.  I can't really explain it better than that.  When you fly too fast through a corner, and understeer, and nail a tree, your car becomes a crumpled undriveable mess of mangled steel.  This isn't GTA, this is a real simulation @ 2000hz (hz=times per second), with thousands of bits for each car.  Due to this, you need a beefy CPU to run this game well and a decent video card to go with it.  Anything i5/i7 or Phenom II quad core or better should run this, and it should be playable on an APU setup or i3 setup without too much fuss, though you might slow it down if you use the commercial truck as it has considerably more points to process.\n\nMODS:  Loads of user-generated content for both vehicles and terrains (maps, levels etc), are available on the games website once you purchase the game.  You won't be let down by this as myself I am a big fan of game modding.  This program also INCLUDES ITS OWN LEVEL EDITOR INSIDE!  Woohoo!  More fun, and it's pretty intuitive to use, your mileage may vary.\n\nFor it's asking price, it's well worth it.  While it's not yet complete, this is more an adults game or a mechanics toy.  If you love cars, and realism, do give this a go!  You can even get computer controlled AI opponents to use if you dig around through the menus and figure it out - though in it's current state, it's either basic pursuit or to FLEE.  Can be quite fun near a steep cliff!\nYou can even change things like GRAVITY (or reverse gravity!) or make it the gravity of the SUN *CRUNCH*.  Wind direction/speed and cloud cover/fog can all be changed - though I am not sure if you can make it rain (yet) or not.\n\nThere's no music yet, and the sounds are quite basic at this point, but there is enough audio feedback to know what's going on, and it will be worked on more.  The graphics are beautiful (I think it's the crytek crysis 3 engine - don't quote me on it though) - and entirely up to par with today's game environments - but still scalable to your PC.  I have a recent model i7 and a radeon 7850 2gb and it runs this quite well with next to no lag.  SSD recommended but by no means required.  Some user levels can be 2gb so if you don't like to wait, put this on your SSD.\n\nKeep in mind, when the game updates, you will have to re-install your mods (this won't usually be the case post-release but in pre-release early access it is, so just be warned!).  Keep your favorite mods backed up.\n\nAll in all, it's a good program for adults, and something to show your kid WHY NOT TO DRIVE TOO FAST!\n\nA great program for the soon-to-be-driving teen-age member of your family!  Best used with a steering wheel or analog gamepad, as it may take quite a bit of time to get used to driving with a keyboard - it's that realistic.\n\n\nAGAIN:  HAVE AN ANALOG GAMEPAD OR STEERING WHEEL FOR THIS GAME, it's an absolute @$^# to drive with a keyboard (but it can be done, but you will crash A LOT).  Use the 'Covet' if you have only a keyboard and GO SLOW.\n\nFun times - whole-heartedly recommended - a well made program!  I seriously have nothing bad to say on this one other than the fact that it's NOT done yet (but it will be!).\n\nUpdate 11/9/2015:  Played a demo-derby scenario - most awesome demo derby ever since Destruction Derby for dos in the mid-to-late 90's.  This is available on the beamng website under mods - you must try it!  Also, races with jumps and Honda spoon Civics ("Covet") and that's fun as can be.  You must give this game a shot, for 25 USD you can't go wrong!\n\nUpdate 12/2015:  Got a SCHOOL BUS vehicle out of the mods section on the game's web site, and a map with a large CLIFF.  Much fun & hilarity ensued.  Many pixels were injured in the making of that one.  Would bust the bus again 10/10.\n\nUpdate 1/1/2016:  Two recent updates have brought game version to 0.5.1, Two new cars, turbo and tuning systems galore, being able to mod the vehicle like you could back in STREET LEGAL, it's really becoming an awesome game/simulator.  More options now, more sounds (yay!), cars can catch fire, and the two new cars mentioned above (a vintage old 1950s car, and a 1988 import sedan) are pretty rockin' awesome.  Back to more fun on the large-cliff-map!","June 17, 2015","true","600.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

Like Spintires, but with a heavy focus on soft body destruction. The video below shows some real life car crashes recreated in beam.ng and it should really drive home what an impressive piece of software this is. Its fun to try things that would get you killed in real life and watch how a car would respond, but it;s also fun just tooling around in really accurately physics modeled cars and watch your pick up truck stall out on a steep incline, or shift gears too quick and throw a rod, or whatever. Also there are tons of things to download on the forums where there is a huge community of moders. It's not a racing game or whatever but it's a very cool thing and if you are on the fence I would certainly recommend it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCbz4gqJgYg","February 9","true","0.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

Drive is a state-of-the-art physics simulator that runs Torque 3D as the main physics engine. In this environment, every movement and input is calculted and recalculted over and over again as the game moves. So, as you come around a corner with your tail out, the computer is taking your car's weight, road surface, throttle, brake, gas, size of the contact patch of the tires, and many more variables into account every second. This allows the game to make an accurate representation of what is going on. Continuing with my example, if you nicked a bump in the road, millions more calcultions would take place, throwing the car around and whatnot. Another important feature that is simulated is air, which, for the time being, is being experimented with.\n\n"So, what do you do in this physics game?" Well, most of us from the beginning have been obsessed with cars and destroying them, so, that's what we do. We take vans and drop them onto hatchbacks; we take hatchs, and put jets on them, and then run them into the wall at 300mph. We also create the game. Due to the producing company's small size (under 15 people total at last check), the community up until now has aided in adding content to the game in the form of maps, vehicles, UI apps (compass, speedo's, tachs, etc), and more. Others constantly push the game, such as accidently making a working plane and several helicopters that are flyable (albiet with primitive controls, depending on the model). As a gamer, having all of this content available for free is awesome. And it's usually good quality stuff that the creators have put hours and weeks into. And it's free.\n\n"I'm a creator/artist/coder/computer wizz. How can I get involved?"\nI'm not sure how this'll work with the game porting over to Steam, but up until now, you would do whatever you'd normally create aand then put in the game. It's quite simple, and the game itself is built to be modded easily (the devs even have a wiki on how to do it). Modelors can make their models in any 3D program, export to COLLADA, create a "JBeam" file, and you're in. Obviously it takes more than just that, but it's a very straight-forward process that even a beginner could do successfully.\n\n"Should I buy this?"\nYes. There's more in the game that can be covered in this review without getting boring, but it is an extremely well-done game. Even though it's only in alpha, it's a pretty good game. Tech support from the community and devs is great, and gme-wide issues are quickly resolved. The physics are great and getting better, the view is spectacular, and who doesn't like smashing cars into each other? Oh, and did I mention the DLC is free? The DLC is free.","August 11, 2014","true","27.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But the as is game does have its problems. Such as car engine sounds (its the same sound for all the cars). And no controller support right out of the box so to speak. There is ways to get the controller support but its though a third party and its difficult to get it working. But the one major problem is the handling. Its almost impossible to keep the cars going in a straight line with a keyboard and mouse. its easier if you have a racing wheel like a G27 but not everyone does. Hopefully in the future they will sort all this out as the game goes into beta. I think there is a great future ahead for this game as long as the devs don't give up.","August 14, 2014","true","16.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I bought this game a while back and I finally got a Steam key. So here is my review. BeamNG Drive is a driving simulator but not really. I think it is more of a vehicle crash simulator. The crash physics are great and the driving physics are getting there. I really like it. The biggest thing that bugs me is the computer performance. Now, I may not have a gaming PC but I can play other games on medium-high graphics and have no trouble. But on this game, it struggles. A little problem is clipping and fall-through. Clipping is when I crash into another vehicle and the textures clip into each other. Therefore wedging the cars together. Fall-through is my term when a car falls through another car. For example, loading the hatchback into the box truck (of course I remove the doors). I drive the car in and it falls out the bottom of the truck. The bad parts are little enough where the good parts stand out. Overall, a great game. I recommend it.","August 13, 2014","true","50.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's probably best known because of the amazing, unique, real-time physics make the cars deform very realistically.\nMost games that have a decent damage system only seem to deform very well somewhere past the more gentle bumps and bashes, but somewhere before the really extreme, high-speed crashes, that would turn a car into mangled pulp, which does take quite a lot of joy out of that insane crash-stunt-thing that you managed to pull off.\n\nBeamNG, though, as the damage is calculated while you are crashing, will have the cars deforming well no matter what end of the scale you push it to- you can watch the very slight deformation that comes from driving a car slightly too hard, and see the little dents and and bashes, all the way up to the car being crushed to such an extreme that the car is left only a couple of inches tall- a phenomenon that is usually caused by setting the gravity to a level that makes the cars float off the ground, before suddenly changing the gravity levels to that of the sun itself.\n\nBut, although that is all amazing, and can bring a LOT of fun, and be interesting to observe, it is not the focus of the game, and it is, for me, not the best part of the game.\n\nAt the time of this review, there are three environments that I consider particularly noteworthy, and a few smaller environments.\nAll of the maps are extremely detailed, and contain a lot to explore. They don't even prevent you from leaving the roads!\nSure, there isn't a huge amount to find away from the beaten path, but if you're like me, then you've probably had that moment in a racing game, when you've just stopped and looked at how beautiful the landscape is, and had a strong desire to go drive all over it.\n\nBeamNG won't surprise you with anything super-amazing if you try to do that, but it won't disappoint, either.\nThat hill will be there, and you'll be able to actually drive all over it, and it will be almost exactly what it looked like it was- although, I will note that it will, in one or two maps, while still turning out to be what it looked like, Also reveal that at the bottom of the other side of the hill, the map suddenly ends in a void.\nIt isn't a huge thing, but it would be a bit more immersive if they'd thrown a random ocean there, or something.\n\nThen, of course, most importantly, there is how the cars feel when you drive them. This is probably the main point of the game, and the most important aspect of any racing game.\nNow, they handle very realistically-there are a few issues to iron out still, but heck, it's an early alpha game and they've already got it THIS realistic? It's pretty insane.\nBut, I'm going to focus on how it feels to drive them. This is the most important point for most gamers, if they are not hardcore simulator fans.\n\nA lot of people have been complaining that the cars are too hard to control, but I'm just using a Logitech F710 -that is, a gamepad with the layout of a PlayStation controller, that emulates a 360 controller, minus the deadzone- and it isn't TOO hard to control the cars.\nThey’re a little hard to control if you’re trying to push them to their limits, but they’re not too hard, and you can always just drive them gently, which is plenty easy.\nIn fact, I don't understand why this game is getting flack for how hard it is to control the cars, when games like Assetto Corsa seem to have few complaints, yet, when I'm playing Assetto I often find that one minute the car feels like it's very stable, and despite the fact that I'm starting to slide it, it feels like I have a LOT of control- then, suddenly, because I applied slightly too much throttle, I find myself backwards and in a cloud of tyre smoke, without any warning, wondering what just happened.\nBeamNG, though, feels so...Natural. Nothing feels forced. If I push too hard, I can see very clearly that the car is slipping out of my control, which sometimes gives me enough of a chance to catch it before it spins- or, at the very least, to put the game in slow motion so that I can watch as the dents form in the car.\n\nY'know, I've always had a thing about watching cars leaning and/or bouncing on their suspension. I can’t really describe it.\nThis game succeeds in giving me the same kind of feeling I get from watching a car's suspension smoothly dealing with a sudden change in elevation, or dealing with the weight shifting to the front of the car under heavy breaking, in real life; I don't remember ever getting that feeling from another game.\n\nAnd, of course, I could talk for days about how detailed, and beautifully designed the cars in this game are.\nThey are very similar to cars that are in reality, yet they are not blatant ripoffs; they have their own look, and their own charm...\nRather like real cars do.\nThey are FAR more detailed than the models in most games, and if you pay attention, you'll notice that the interior of the car is actually part of the model, and you can see it in all it's glory from 3rd person view, if you manage to get the camera to be looking in the window.\n\n...I'll stop here, before this gets any longer. Even as it is, it'll be a pain in the neck to proofread.\n\nI will note, though, that the game is very resource intensive. back when I got the game (the day after it was first released), I only had an old-ish laptop, and, as I expected, it got an average of about 20 FPS with the least CPU intensive cars, which was not very playable. But, I now have an AMD FX-8320, which is OC'd to 4.4 GHz, and a Sapphire 7870 HD, and it runs the game as smoothly as a Codemaster game's menu animation.\nYou should make sure that your computer has enough power before you buy the game, or you may be somewhat disappointed. And, don't expect to be able to run a tonload of cars, either.\nIf you have a good CPU, you'll be able to run about 6 cars at once.\n\nAlso, don't expect a complete, polished game, because it isn't. It's an early alpha release, being worked on by a VERY small team, and this game is more advanced than any driving game before. EVER. So don't expect it to be developed at lightning speed. The devs are releasing updates at a good pace, but the bigger changes and features can take a few months to implement, and there are a few [small issues] to deal with at the moment, such as slightly tacky engine sounds.\n\nTL;DR: Amazing physics, good graphics, good maps, good devs, good game. Shut up and take my money. And the money of whoever is reading this review, for that matter.\n\nI expect I'll come back in the future and update this review as the game progresses.","August 11, 2014","true","24.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/polku/recommended/284160/","polku","Polku","http://steamcommunity.com/id/polku/","175 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst let's do the obious: Would I recommend this game? Yes, but with big disclaimer. At it's current state there is not much "game" in this game. It's just incredibly accurate physics simulator sandbox with cars in it. But as an engineer I've lost my heart to this thing. I've banked incredible hours into this game before steam release just crashing stuff and sometimes generally trying to stay on the roads.\n\nLet me open that "generally trying to stay on the roads" don't even think about that trying to do anything else than crash cars into various objects next to the object you aimed for with just keyboard controls. The cars are incredibly twichy to drive without precision control like in any driving game aiming for high- to ultra realism in their drivingmodel (and no driving aids). Xbox360-controller, yes good start, but I would recommend somekind of steering wheel for any tries to stay on roads. Altought at this moment you should be prepared to do some input mapping manually with notepad etc, if you have older or more exotic wheel and even then force feedback is no-go (Xbox360-controller works great straight out of the box).\n\nThen few words about cars and tracks included at this moment. They are good start, but one sportcar one 90's saloon, frontwheel driven hatchback, van, musclecar and pickup are quite limited choices (I won't mention the threewheeler as it is right now completely undriveable). Also out of the six maps there is just three actual ones to drive around and they have very little variance between them. The rest three are just empty map, big hill to make your car look like raisin and a crash testing field. But as with this game's spiritual predesessor ROR there are community made maps and cars, and oh boy there are those. Ranging from poor mods made by sticking something like Audi R8-model on the games sportscar Jbeam map without modifications to it (so that the car stars to crumble before it actually hits anything) to completely custom made models where you actually can nearly put your crash results next to euroncap footage and not see no big obious differences. Altought most of the older ones you can find most likely won't work correctly as they made some changes lately that can break models made before that update. From the map side I've not yet come accross a incredible map, but some ok-ones I've tested. This tought I'm sure will selfcorrect as this game comes available here in steam as this game includes as far as I can understand pretty comprehensive level designing and customising tools. NOT USERFRIENDLY, but comprehensive!\n\nAs I wrote would I recommend this game at the start, let me end by writing what I've like to see in this game. Firstly ofcourse is to see some actual "game"-like systems implimented. Some of these like basic checkpoints for racing etc. I've understand are just few updates away, but that career mode promised in that trailer sounds like a dream come true if they manage to get it out sometime. Second thing I'd like to see is Steam workshop support for easier installation of the community made models and maps. Third I'd like to see more cars and maps in the vanilla version, mayby even if they would manage to get some real cars licenced for this game it would be great.

So happy :3 Now to the review, this game is really good, but lacks some polishing. Of course, it's still on early alpha, yada yada, but it could be better. The video quality is great, but has some framelag every now and then, and some audio failures when you break. The controls are a bit confusing too, but they are good, for people who use a controller, not if you use a keyboard, because if you do, sorry.\nBad things aside, this game is incredibly enjoyable, and with mods it gets even better. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys racing games, simulation games and physics games.

Slow motion crashing is surprisingly entertaining though, and I've sunk a good few hours just smashing stuff up.\n\nHowever, a lot of potential is taken away by the extremely dodgy car and camera controls. Camera in the game tends to drift in the exact opposite direction you want it to go, forcing you to constantly hold down the right mouse button to control it. Cars don't seem to have any grip on road surfaces and slide around uncontrollably if you choose to drive faster than a granny on her way to shop groceries. In short, the cars don't drive well and you will fly off the road if you go faster than 40mph....which DOES look very nice, but you'll have to weight that against there being literally nothing else in the game that works, as of now.\n\nIt's still early in development, so only buy it now if you really enjoy soft body physics, otherwise wait for more features and improvements on the existing ones.","August 14, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

If you are the kind of person that LOVES crashing cars, then GET THIS GAME. The physics are unreal. They are incredible.\n\nPros:\n- Incredibly realistic phsyics\n- Great graphics for a physics based game\n- Greats mods (maps, vehicles, engines, etc)\n- make your own custom maps\n- vehicles are great\n- TONS of options for your cars (not quite total customization, but you can change the colors, engines, type of car [i.e. make a care the "off-road" version of that car and much more], etc.)\n- shadows are great\n- modding this game without the steam workshop is very easy\n- it is in alpha state, and yet i have not had much trouble with any bugs. Maybe a few here and there but it's in good state right now\n- there are 5 motion options: Realtime, 2x slower than realtime, 4x slower than realtime, 8x slower than realtime, and 100x slower than realtime\n- car crashes are unbelievably realistic and awesome\n\nCons:\n- You will need at least a decent computer to be able to play this game\n- shadows (at highest setting) take A LOT of memory and can cause, depending on your kind of computer, a 5-50 fps drop (since my machine isnt the greatest, i lose a great amount of FPS if i put shadows on high. I lose about 30-40 FPS)\n- the audio is not that great, but i believe they are working on an update with new and better audio\n- i personally did not enjoy the default maps that came with the game. BUT there are AMAZING custom maps on the forums that you can download (mods)\n\n\n\nFinal verdict:\n\nIf you like crashing cars, get this game. If you love realistic physics in videogames, get this game. If you are looking for a racing game, this game might not be for you. YES this game IS getting a racing update, but i doubt it will be as good as other games that are made specifically for racing (forza, burnout, need for speed, etc.).

Going between trying to do the set up tracks, crashing into walls, flipping your car violently, and calmly driving down a dirt road on a small island is a great mix of driving magic without any consequences.\n\nI'm looking forward to community and in house mad maps like the grid with challenges and courses filled with traps and trials that you need to execute with the surprisingly effective driving model.  Keep this in mind.  DO NOT try to use a keyboard.  It's hard enough to try to get used to the steering sensetivity with an xbox controller, but on the same note, it's a sensetivity that is needed to accomadate the full usage of the steering model.\n\nThe mods and community made parts of the game keep it interesting, while the first party models and tracks are still equal, if not slightly better in quality.

I have been so impressed with this game I have even bought it twice! When I lost my account a while back, I decided that I should help the developers out a bit and just buy it again! There are games like Wreckfest, which i own, but I have never seen content being added this fast and with this quality. Just buy this game. I would of recommended it more at it's old price, £9.99, but still at £18.99 it's still worth every penny. You may not like this game, you may not like it at it's current state, but just give it a go. Steam have refunds now so you can return it if it really isn't your thing, but I would recommend keeping it for a while just to see where it is going.

The dev team has been amazing in supporting and updating the game.\n\nPros:\nAmazing physics, detailed car design, helpful dev team. The maps are absolutely beautiful also.\n\nCons:\nThe engine is a small bit unoptimized, but the dev team is working on it. Also, sometimes there is a while between updates but the past few have been very timely, and it seems a lot of background work is behind us.\n\nAll-in-all I recommend this game, though it might not be for everyone. A majority of the game right now is a free-roam crashing simulator, though the devs have added a good many situations and races.\n\nAlso, this is a state of the art engine. You'll need a fast CPU, and sadly AMD has an architecture stuck in the past. More cores do help, but your AMD will need to be clocked a fair bit higher than usual to keep the FPS other games do. A modern (4+ series) Intel needs about 3.4Ghz to play most of the cars, to keep even the most intensive at 60+fps you'll need 4.0Ghz. Like I said though the engine is being optimized.\n\nOn the GPU side you can keep solid 60fps on medium with a 280x, and high will keep you mostly 60 but sometimes into the lower 50s. If you max the game with PostFX and reflections it will drag a 280x into the 20fps range and even a 290x has issues keeping up. This hasn't been as much of an issue until this update, so I'll update if it changes again.\n\nTL;DR smashy, you need a good computer.

There are also plenty of mods on the internet, so you can add content, although it is not always stable.\n\nWith that being said, I think this game should be bought because of the technology, and the possible implications of these same soft body physics in future games. If they really get this right, I think we could have some really incredible racing sims among other things. Don't get me wrong, though, I really do enjoy playing the game in its current state, but I think you should buy it for the possibility of some amazing games in the future with similar soft-body collision physics.","June 2, 2015","true","75.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hands down. See how many hours I've played it? And that's just from Steam Experimental Release to now. I probably had 75-100 more hours before that.\n\nThe game runs beautifully, and simulates perfectly. If you are deciding whether or not to buy this, let me give you the REAL pros and cons.\n\nPROS:\n- Large Community online, creating new vehicles, terrains, etc\n- Many vehicles already in-game that work flawlessly\n- Physics to the extreme, you feel every bump, and so does your car.\n- The map quality is phenomenal.\n- Customization is fun to mess with.\n- Built in terrain editor!\n- You won't get bored. You can drift, you can race, you can crash test, and it never ends.\n\nCONS:\n- Requires a BEEFY graphics card and processor to run on higher settings. Don't try running Lighting Quality any higher than Lowest without a dedicated graphics card.\n- Vehicle customization could be taken further, with more possible parts for each car.\n- A keyboard isn't much fun. Logitech G27 Master Race.\n- BEWARE RUSSIAN MODS FOR THIS GAME.\n\nI have an Intel i7-3770S with Intel HD 4000 Graphics, and I run the game with Mesh/Texture Quality on Normal and Lighting/Shadow Quality on Lowest and get good fps all around. This game takes a lot to run, which is understandable.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nBuy the game. It's worth whatever you pay for it. The game is only going to get better, so why not get it now?\nIT IS WORTH EVERY CENT YOU PAY. I SWEAR.\nIf you are looking for the ultimate crash testing, car smashing, racing, drifting, customizing, community-involved car game out there, it's this.\n\n\nNote: This game is much more enjoyable with a racing/steering wheel or controller for turning movements. I personally use a Logitech G27, and it is so worth it.","August 12, 2014","true","305.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Slow motion crashing is surprisingly entertaining though, and I've sunk a good few hours just smashing stuff up.\n\nHowever, a lot of potential is taken away by the extremely dodgy car and camera controls. Camera in the game tends to drift in the exact opposite direction you want it to go, forcing you to constantly hold down the right mouse button to control it. Cars don't seem to have any grip on road surfaces and slide around uncontrollably if you choose to drive faster than a granny on her way to shop groceries. In short, the cars don't drive well and you will fly off the road if you go faster than 40mph....which DOES look very nice, but you'll have to weight that against there being literally nothing else in the game that works, as of now.\n\nIt's still early in development, so only buy it now if you really enjoy soft body physics, otherwise wait for more features and improvements on the existing ones.","August 14, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I've owned this since Christmas '13 and it's mid-August. Development has been pretty consistent and I've seen it grow quite a bit in this short time.

If you don't think your computer can run BeamNG.Drive, download the demo (available on the BeamNG.Drive website) or just don't buy the game at all. Please do not waste your money and ♥♥♥♥♥ on the community forums, thanks ~\n\nSince it's been a year, I figured I'd update my review. BeamNG.Drive is a highly accurate vehicle tech demo, featuring extremely realistic soft-body damage. While it was initially nothing fantastic in the graphics department, a few updates before the early access release certainly bumped up the graphics an sizable amount. I was blown away by the realtime reflections and the subtle lighting changes are a welcome inclusion as well. Be warned though, as you're going to need a powerful computer to play BeamNG.Drive. The demo itself is certainly more optimized than it once was, but you're still going to need a powerful CPU and a Great GPU to get the most out of BeamNG.Drive\n\nThere are certain objectives in the newest update that adds a bit more of a goal to the game, but there is also a sandbox mode, appropriately called "Free Roam." If you loved playing with the swing set glitch in Grand Theft Auto 4, you're going to love this. (BeamNG is also planning on adding a campaign to the demo as well (at which I'll officially refer to BNG.D as a game).\n\nIt's finally available for purchase through Steam, and all updates are provided through Steam as well (this seems obvious, but initially, before the game was even on Steam, there wasn't an update method besides direct download, and that was later to be upgraded with a proprietary updater. The addition of Steam updates is a lot more convenient.)\n\nOverall, there is something hypnotic about the game; crashing the same car into the same ramps and walls over and over again should get boring really quickly, and yet it doesn't. I have played this demo more than anything else on Steam, and I personally hate car and racing games.

The dev team has been amazing in supporting and updating the game.\n\nPros:\nAmazing physics, detailed car design, helpful dev team. The maps are absolutely beautiful also.\n\nCons:\nThe engine is a small bit unoptimized, but the dev team is working on it. Also, sometimes there is a while between updates but the past few have been very timely, and it seems a lot of background work is behind us.\n\nAll-in-all I recommend this game, though it might not be for everyone. A majority of the game right now is a free-roam crashing simulator, though the devs have added a good many situations and races.\n\nAlso, this is a state of the art engine. You'll need a fast CPU, and sadly AMD has an architecture stuck in the past. More cores do help, but your AMD will need to be clocked a fair bit higher than usual to keep the FPS other games do. A modern (4+ series) Intel needs about 3.4Ghz to play most of the cars, to keep even the most intensive at 60+fps you'll need 4.0Ghz. Like I said though the engine is being optimized.\n\nOn the GPU side you can keep solid 60fps on medium with a 280x, and high will keep you mostly 60 but sometimes into the lower 50s. If you max the game with PostFX and reflections it will drag a 280x into the 20fps range and even a 290x has issues keeping up. This hasn't been as much of an issue until this update, so I'll update if it changes again.\n\nTL;DR smashy, you need a good computer. I rate 10/10","May 30, 2015","true","177.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have to say, as a game in and of itself, it isn't great, but the destruction is very satisfying, and it is VERY fun to play around with different things. There are also plenty of mods on the internet, so you can add content, although it is not always stable.\n\nWith that being said, I think this game should be bought because of the technology, and the possible implications of these same soft body physics in future games. If they really get this right, I think we could have some really incredible racing sims among other things. Don't get me wrong, though, I really do enjoy playing the game in its current state, but I think you should buy it for the possibility of some amazing games in the future with similar soft-body collision physics.","June 2, 2015","true","75.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I thought it was so cool to see to cars slamming into each other and fly across the road. I was 5.\nDuring that phase I kept looking for a video game that would let me do that. All I found were animations, or unrealistic games.\nLater on, about a year ago, I saw GMOD on sale and decided to buy it, thinking it would suit my needs. I didn't.\nI was so dissapointed. Would I ever find what I was looking for?\nA few months later, I saw BeamNg through the corner of my eye on youtube and went to check it out.\nI thought it was beautiful. Within a few weeks of that moment I had owned the game.\nSo, in conclusion, thank you BeamNg.Drive. You have fufilled my crazy childhood dreams(even though I am still a kid) by making an awesome game which is hours of fun.\n\nNow, on to the good stuff!\nPROS:\nEverything above\nSuper Realistic\nfully Modable\nCONS:\nYou NEED a TURBO POWERFUL computer(I mean it when I say that) to run this game. I had to buy a $100 GTX 750 Graphics card to increase the preformance from 5-15 to 40-55 FPS. It STILL runs a little slow.\n\nOverall, this is the ultimate car game. Get it.

I would not be too worried though if you have even a q6600 because any quad core would handle this game pretty well. Even an old one.

There is a nice idea here; the damage physics of the cars is very well done, if not slightly too delicate at times and there is the occasional Sorcerer suspense in trying to get your car or truck across rocky terrain, to the checkpoints, without putting your radiator out or falling off a cliff.

BeamNG.drive offers a unique sandbox experience in which you can choose from various maps and vehicles, enjoy their detail, and the exquisite damage physics. I have split this review into two categories, gameplay and performance.\n\nGameplay: The game offers a fantastic sandbox experience, but also a scenario mode where you can play scenarious on different maps. Maps and vehicles are very unique and detailed. Maps are beautifully textured. Vehicles have super-realistic damage physics, the most realistic out there in my opinion. Cars have different variants, you can swap parts, change the color, etc. They also have very high quality textures, reflections, and working interiors. BeamNG involves either driving random cars on random maps, or doing scenarios, but the possibilities are endless.\n\nPerformance: Before the recent 5.4.0 update, performance wasn't that great. For me, I didn't mind because I loved the game. But after this update, performance has increased by nearly 50%. Maps that would run at 15 fps now run at a silky smooth 40-50. Great job devs! Keep up the great work!\n\nI may add to this review later, but overall I would recommend this game to someone looking for a good sandbox experience, admires realistic looking cars, terrains, and physics.","April 20","true","114.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a heavy game as well, even with my PC equipped with a 4790K and a GTX 970 I had FPS drops. The main reason I had to refund though was due to the sound being strangely intermittent, it would warp if that makes sense.\n\nOverall though I really love this game and if your PC can handle it and you love physics based shenanigans, buy it! I may have had issues with it but I really loved the game even though the issues were extremely distracting. Hopefully you will not suffer the same issues as myself and in the future, I am definitely going to be giving this game another chance because it is absolutely awesome!\n\nI just wish I hadn't had to have refunded it because this game deserves all the support it can get!","March 9","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is also running very, very smoothly with very low input latency. Performance is easily 2x over what it was a year ago, let alone when they first put the tech demo on their website,\n\nUsing high and low filtering at 30, slightly increased max FFB and overall ffb strengths and 600 sampling. Each car feels believably unique, even each variant. Right now, I consider the FFB to be excellent, better than games like dirt rally and iracing.\n\nThe cement mixer is so much more immursive and alive than any ETS2+ trucks.\n\n\nThe devs have consistently worked away at all core issues and have really made a pretty special simulator.\n\n","May 28","true","22.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The crashes are ultra realistic, the damage is ultra realistic, and the physics are ultra realistic. And don't let the graphics card requirements turn you down, because this game really doesn't need that great of a card to run at max graphics settings. I'm running it maxed out at 60+ fps on my Gtx 560 ti 2gb phantom, so no need to buy yourself a Gtx 670 for this game. This game runs great on my pc, but the framerate drops to around 20-40 with 5 cars on screen at the same time, because the game still needs some optimizations. The more cars on screen, the more processor power your pc needs, because each vehicle is extremely highly detailed, and has lots of deformation points and breakables. Ever single vehicle is very advanced and detailed, so you need a very good cpu at the moment if you want to play with 5+ cars on screen. I have an Intel core I5-3470 3.20GHz quad core cpu, and it can handle around 5 cars on screen at once with playable framerates. They said they are gonna improve framerates later on. They want to make 7 cars on screen at once run smoothly on a mid range processor, so the cpu requirements will get lower with the updates. Another awesome thing about this game is all the maps and cars you can download for free. You can also make maps and vehicles and upload them to beamng's website for others to download. It's a lot of fun, and you can do anything vehicle related you've always wanted to do with no limitations! The game's map editor is also very easy to use once you get used to it. You can create cutom objects and buildings for the map editor too by using other programs like sketchup and importing your creations to beamng's editor. It is fairly simple and easy to do. Just watch a tutorial video or two, and you can make maps with ease. Sorry for the long post, I just needed to tell you if you feel the game lacks content, you can create your own content or download content for it that other people created. The game also gets updates, since it's still work in progress, so even if you don't download or make content for the game, you will still have a great time, although I reccomend downloading others's creations and making your own stuff for the game, because it makes the game more fun. This game is very realistic and very fun at the same time. Your car can even run out of fuel, but don't worry about filling up every 2 minutes, because it takes as long as in real life for the cars in this game to run out of fuel. Besides, you'll probably wreck the car before you can get a chance to run out of fuel, since one hard crash can pretty much total your vehicle. This game is a lot of fun, and very realistic at the same time. 10 out of 10. The perfect vehicle simulator.","August 12, 2014","true","88.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

No other game is like this; Next Car Game kind of gets close but BugBear don't do much with it.

If you like cars and racing/driving games like i do a lot, then i can't recommend this game enough, and even if you don't really like racing/driving games, just crashing all of the cars into walls in slow motion is the most satisfying thing you can do in any game ever.

This game has matured so much since I've had it. I've played it daily, I've watched it grow, I've poured many hours into this game and interacted with the community. I taught myself many driving techniques with this game (with some mods so stalling a car is actually possible). This game was the exact game i've wanted since I was a little one playing Flatout 2 on my Xbox. Does it have problems? Absolutely. Do these matter? Absolutely not. I can't get enough of this game. The physics are satisfying, and feel real. I've yet to play a game that can make me cringe when I hit something as small as a trash can at low speed like this one can. The cars are unique and beautiful and every one is labored over to give it the exact characteristics of real life equivalents. They're fun, most imporantly, and I can't get enough of whipping the hatchback (Ibishu Covet) around a corner, or abusing the hell out of the Offraod version of the Pickup (Gavril D-Series). Even the level design shows detail, with maps being unique and having a variety of roads and ways to have fun, be it rallying through country in a small Japanese compact, or tearing up the streets in a souped up American Saloon, or ignoring roads and trails in a jacked-up delivery van. Yes, $24.99 may seem risky for an Early Access game, but these devs absolutely show promise. They constantly update the game, they constantly interact with their community, and I've even had conversations with some of the staff... They're great people, and they love this game like it was their child. They prioritize keeping the game updated, fresh with fun and new stuff, and fixing major problems. I can't tell anyone what to do with their money, but I can more than recommend buying this game to anyone who consults me on it. Please do yourself this favor.\n\nQuick notes about this game:\n-ABSOLUTELY USE A CONTROLLER OR WHEEL, keyboard is still fun but is nowhere near as great as the former two options\n-Fairly demanding, don't expect to have 10-car derbies with a laptop. Even my i7 4790k and GTX 980 only do 9 cars at once on certain levels before it becomes difficult to play\n-Bear with the devs, there are problems that pop up... With this in mind, do go to the official BeamNG forums for help, the community and devs always find solutions to these problems","August 11, 2014","true","262.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

When comparing the two, it is evident that lots of lessons have been learnt and that each developer has improved greatly in their respective field, resulting in state of the art physics that simulate every single part of a vehicle/object with almost true to life accuracy (with accuracy and efficiency being improved as development goes on), near perfectly modelled fictional vehicles that each represent a certain type of vehicle, resulting in a diverse, albeit small selection (current vehicle list, [wiki.beamng.com] in-dev, concept vehicles list[wiki.beamng.com]) , and fantastic locations[wiki.beamng.com] that push the graphics engine, Torque3D[www.garagegames.com] to its limits. Currently, the Small Island map is my personal favourite mainly due to the recent overhaul that added so many little details. I hope Dry Rock is also updated in a similar fashion.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it is currently just a sandbox, but a planned update will bring timed races (no advanced AI YET) and online leaderboards to the table as the first step in the direction of given gameplay, but I still think the sandbox will be where the majority of the entertainment is.\n\nThe game is very moddable, all sorts of vehicles can be added, including helicopters and planes, levels can be created in the in-game level editor, and LUA files that make up quite a lot of the code can be freely edited to tailor your experience to your liking or even add features. A feature that I quite like that has been created by the community with LUA scripting has been changing the engine sound depending on the vehicle that is being used. Mods should only be downloaded from the official forum's showroom and downloading from anywhere else will either leave you with some kind of malware or very disappointed.\n\nThe current sound system is a placeholder to avoid people moaning about "sound not working" really, with a single engine, skid, and crash sound making up the entirety of the vehicle's vocabulary (can be modded though) and a few ambient background tracks. This will be completely redone eventually.\n\nThe vehicle's handling characteristics can be quirky at times with some seemingly random veering at very high speeds and vehicles losing friction too easily, but the physics will be continuously improved and tweaked to ensure maximum authenticity. I can see this rivalling high profile racing simulators in the future.\n\nThe game needs a fairly high end CPU (or more specifically, a CPU with fairly powerful cores) in order to run the physics smoothly. My i5 3570k can run 4 detailed vehicles smoothly, but those with certain AMD CPUs may struggle. Even though they have lots of cores, each core is quite weak. To run the game at max graphical settings, a fairly powerful GPU will also be required, but most semi-recent mid range video cards should be able to run it with lower settings fine. The tech demo will be updated soon so I suggest going to beamng.com and trying it out before purchasing.\n\nI've probably sunk hundreds of hours into it so it's safe to say that I've probably got my money's worth.\n\nI think that is all I currently have to say, but I'll probably remember something else in 5 minutes.\n\nTL;DR:  Physics, mods, don't complain if your ZX Spectrum doesn't run it at 120 fps etc.","August 11, 2014","true","57.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scmstr/recommended/284160/","scmstr","nWg. SC[m]STR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scmstr/","579 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n8/13/2014\ngot my alpha code in email because i had played it a while ago. last time i had played it, it was very similar, but a lot more buggy and had less content. that was probably 1-3 years ago, i cant remember. but i had only played it for an hour and got fed up with it before uninstalling it because it was so ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nNOW, it installs over steam, has longish loading times (who cares though), the controls are kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for m+k but work if you're patient and learn to tap and feather the keys you can deal with it, and the graphics (artstyle) are fairly nice, but a little lacking contrast in the colors.\n\nThe game runs fairly well, considering how much ♥♥♥♥ is actually being drawn on screen and how the devs implemented it (see: placing a bunch of objects on screen by hand). Which means: its really nice to explore and see the sights, but you need a powerful computer to do it. I'm running a 768mb 460gtx and a first gen i7. With all graphics up to high (except the garrys mod-esqe post processing) I get about 15fps while completely stationary in a forrest. with most things on lowest or low (lowest threshold until the game looks like ♥♥♥♥ due to flat meshes and NO shading) I can get up to about 55fps.\n\nthere's a lot of pop-in for random tree areas and buildings, which isnt really a big deal but worth noting.\n\nthe car handling itself is fairly difficult, because at low speeds the cars handle alright but once you speed up, the fps chugs randomly, the cars feel like they're on ice and makes crashes/flips inevitable. It almost feels like they're trying to make you crash. This is neat for showing off your crash mechanics (which i admit are incredible, i ripped out a part of my steering on one side because i high centered over a large rock and couldnt control that wheel much) you can ctrl+r to reload your vehicle and drop five feet away, but the location drifts a little to one direction each time and you can easily be stuck in a load-loop into a wall or trees or some other obsticle with no way out except to keep hitting reload unti you come out the other side. Pretty annoying, yet..... somehow satisfying when you're free.\n\nIf I get a wheel or controller, a more powerful computer, and they keep adding content and fixing bugs, I'd say this game could be the driving sandbox (gta style raging/romping) equivalent of a walking-sim type game. There are jumps, trails, roads all around the island in grand touring style, big meadows, swamps, ponds, beaches, abandoned buildings a la ken block, and lots of things to smash your car on and have to reset. It would make a VERY nice exploration/relaxing/personal satisfaction driving sim with a high potential of adventure.\n\nMy biggest desires for adds/fixes for this game are:\n1) customizable suspension and drivetrain settings to tweak\n2) them to keep adding more content because I like the style they're doing it in (the offroad 4x4 stuff is REALLY nice)\n3) optimizations ZOMG<---\n4) better color palette (its not bad, just leaves something to be desired and feels washed out when out in the open)\n6) more cars!!!\n7) the handling to not be so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (maybe this is just because im trying to control a sim driving game with a keyboard)\n8) better follow-view camera\n9) some extra motivation for playing it besides just screwing around (missions, characters, story, multiplayer, rpg, unlocking more content/vehicles/zones/parts/things, races, timetrials)\n10) the ability to get out of the car and do other things, gta style)\n\nRight now, the game isnt worth much if you dont like driving around irl or in gta games. I dont know much about the pacing of the dev, but Im going to go ahead and say they're slow as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nIn a few years, maybe this game will be really cool. But, until then, its very much in alpha and has been for a long time. If this is your thing, cool, if you can't entertain yourself by driving around and exploring in a very buggy game, steer clear of this one for now.\n\nsound: 6/10 (nice directionality, but all cars sound the same and stuff isnt very dynamic. great ambience. not too buggy.)\ngraphics: 7.5/10 (if you could get it all to run at a decent fps with no pop-in or stuttering, it would be VERY nice.)\nmenus: 5/10 (lots of options, yet somehow still lacking options. average to bad organization. very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ loading times.)\nart: 7/10 (cool, sterile, matrix like maps. really cool idea of loading up a world feel. surprisingly immersive. "cozy".)\nplayability: 4/10 (sub average. frustrating experience driving around on the roads, but very pleasurable 4x4 experiences.)\nvalue: 6/10 (the ability to drop in with no strings is a double edged sword. easy to get into, easy to get out of once it crashes.)\n\noverall: 6/10 (its a slightly above average early access game with a lot of potential. whether or not the devs will realize their own potential is a whole different story. I'm going to learn towards "yes, but not in any near time in the future if ever")\n\n","August 13, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I am so happy to  see how far it has come over the years and I can't wait to see what the dev team have for us in the upcoming years. The game has loads of custom content ranging from skins, vehicles, scenarios and even fully set up maps. Some mods are full of awesome quality some aren't.

Crashing cars in any game is fun but in the case of BeamNG.drive it is outrageously fantastic. The game has an incredible physics engine and beautiful graphic detail which delivers some of the most realistic gameplay I have ever come across in a driving simulator. The variety of vehicles within the game is also very well rounded and with the different mods that can be added on to the game, that variety extends even further. The game isn't without it's flaws which is to be expected with an early access title, but as it is right now, BeamNG.Drive is a great game and is definitely worth a play.","January 26","true","24.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It does map to a wheel now. So at least it has that now.\n\nIt works with an xbox 360 controller fairly well.\n\nIf you total your car you may have to restart the game, because it just spawns the other car right next to it. If there are trees or other cars you will spawn inside them.\n\nThe game is not very  playable as it is. Its ok for about 10 minutes or so at a time, but after that it crashes, or you will just get bored.\n\nI am not sure the developers mission. The progress has been really slow since I got the game. I expect in the end for the game to be playable, and hopefully at the sim level for driving experience. As for what kind of sim it will be, I am guessing a crash sim involving all terrain situations.\n\n\n\n","September 25, 2015","true","2.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","5","11","2","8"

I'm on the last of a fifteen checkpoint trial. I slide around a corner doing twenty-five. My eyes widen in terror when I see a tree clip my back wheel, bending it all to hell and making the race impossible to finish. *presses "R" to restart for the tenth time*\n\nLet me just say, this game is hard. Your car will feel slow and clunky and will squash like a bug at seemingly stupid slow speeds. It is just about as realistic in that regard as it gets. Like any racing game, there are fast and slow cars. Except they all break equally as easy, so don't think going faster is always better.\n\nAnd as for so many people saying the cars feel like they're on ice, ignore them. If you've ever driven on solid ice, you would know that you can't get going more than a few miles an hour in a decent turn before you're going sideways. A car is held in place by four little patches of rubber each about the size of your hand. Once you break sliding friction, you're boned.\n\nAlso, for anyone turned off by the fact that this is a "crashing simulator," I would also disagree. The fun is in the trials. The launching your car off a four story cube in the test world gets boring after a while. There are something like 15 ish trials right now that range from small circuits to long rallies to silly stuff like seeing if you can jump four ramps in a row or make your way down a six-hundred foot cliff. There will be a campaign mode integrated eventually.\n\nThe game encourages smart driving (knowing the limits of your car, how fast you need to enter turns, when to accelerate and when to brake). You don't need a steering wheel or pedals, but I'm sure they'd be fun.\n\nThe only issue I have with the game is its checkpoint system. First of all, they're huge and kinda ugly. Secondly, if you try to switch out your vehicle with another mid-race, it screws everything up.\n\nI don't mind this one, but the sound is kinda awful. Engines sounds are cool, crashes are just okay, but the tire squeeling is horrible.\n\nThis game is fun for what it is already, and definitely worth the money. The devs do decent sized updates about every month now and release bug fixes several times a month to deal with whatever they broke in the patches and/or fix other small issues.\n\nI never write reviews, but I figured this would be the one. Just goes to show how great I think this game is.","June 3, 2015","true","5.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You got working head and taillights (with brights!) you have turn singles and hazards, you can see the pedals on the floor corrospond with your actions! the only thing you don't have is a horn.\n\nBut now for the cons...\nAll the Cars/Trucks/SUVS/things! have the same engine noise! (Except the Ibishu Covet, Which has a peppy I-4)\n\nOh also the bugs/crash issues (BUT most of the time these are fixed in the same month.)\nNOTE: I have played this game for almost a 2 3/4 years, I got this game before it came onto steam.\n\n(P.S NOTE: This review was edited because most of the negetive stuff I had in this review was patched in game!)","June 3, 2015","true","24.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you have been\ndreaming of a game with realistic crash damage, this is absolutely the game for you. The soft body physics are pretty well flawless unless you download a ported community created car. Most community created cars are done well though and are very fun to play with in this smash em' up car simulator. One thing I'm sad about is that there is no community workshop for this game for user created cars and maps so you have to download from their  website [www.beamng.com]. Even still, installation of community creations is very simple; just a drag and drop of a folder. There are some missions for you to play where you can drive through checkpoints and do jumps and all, but besides that, there is no objective other than what you make up. You can test your car's durability as hard as you want with this game. It gives you complete freedom of how to smash your car, always with a satisfying result and that is why recommend this game.","April 15","true","22.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Though the title says that Beam.NG Drive is in Beta testing, it is definately worth the money! As there are many pros to this game, I would like to point out the only con of this whole game. I would DEFINATELY RECCOMEND this game for people who have computers with a 4.0 or over graphics processor on their computers. I have a 4.0 on my graphics processor (I obviously don't play lots of games on my PC), and unfortunately I lag a lot on maps other that the empty, infinite one, and the testing area with the half pipes and stuff. <-- (Sorry, I forgot the names of the maps..) Anyways, for a lot of reasons I would actually definately reccomend this game to people with (fairly good) computers.","June 26, 2015","true","53.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's Red Faction for cars, with plenty to mess around with, though lacking any objective outside of short missions varying from driving routes to disabling ai vehicles, seperate from the free-roam structure that you would spend most of your time in. There are frequent updates and an interesting modding community, adding plenty of tracks and vehicles.\n\nThere are a few negatives in it's lack of objective and the mildly annoying camera, plus physics crashes, ui bugs and unresponsive controls do happen relatively often, but overall I'd still recommend it to anyone.","December 19, 2015","true","100.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Had the game before steam and I really enjoyed the concept, the physics in the game are pretty amazing. For me, the game was a bit resource intensive and demanded a bit from my pc. I really don't have the greatest hardware so I can't say this will be constant between all PCs, which it more than likely won't be, but it did seem to need a bit to play smoothly. Other than that and at the time the vehicle selection was lacking, the game is great, graphics are great and the simulator is really fun if you love crashing vehicles into things and going on loop-d-loops","December 30, 2015","true","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You cannot compare this with 'Next Car Game', they are completely different games. 'Next Car Game' sacrifices it's realism for a better racing experience, whereas BeamNG.drive focuses completely on realism. The developers plan on adding a career mode with various gamemodes such as races and delivery missions. At the current time, even without these missions, this is by far my favourite "racing" game.","June 20, 2015","true","34.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's Red Faction for cars, with plenty to mess around with, though lacking any objective outside of short missions varying from driving routes to disabling ai vehicles, seperate from the free-roam structure that you would spend most of your time in. There are frequent updates and an interesting modding community, adding plenty of tracks and vehicles.\n\nThere are a few negatives in it's lack of objective and the mildly annoying camera, plus physics crashes, ui bugs and unresponsive controls do happen relatively often, but overall I'd still recommend it to anyone.","December 19, 2015","true","100.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Crashing seems really good if you have seen real crashes\n\n- Cars. You can choose in Early access many cars not just few like many other sandbox games gives us.\n\n- Car Tuning.  In some cars you can tune them a lot! it makes it really interesting :)\n\nNEGATIVE\n\n- Driving :(   Sadly the driving isnt really good and you lose your grip REALLY easily. driving in a normal road 60km/h and wosh you are in the tree next time..\n\n- Scenarios.  Scenarios becomes negative just because the driving.. some Scenarios are really fun and cool but when you get a road what is jumpy as hell.. you just cannot keep your car straight it just keeps going to the tree in no time.\n\n- AI.  The bot driver mostly these Scenarios where you are a Police this AI can be smart or just really really stupid.. there isnt much where you versus bot is but I hope there will be more..\n\nYeah this game isnt now or never will be made for Racing or do missions etc but I hope :) its a good start and I believe it will be good in the end..\n\n7/10 would cry more but tired","January 8","true","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game has some great potential and the full version is almost out (kinda) some people say it gets boring but I think it is fun there is always something to do. The physics are great probably the best in a game (at least in a car game) driving the cars with the keybord is diffucult but not impossible if you have and xbox controler or a wheel it is easier to drive. There are frequent updates at least once a month and when it does update they add a lot to it and fix a lot.

I promised one of the people at BeamNG I would give an honest review of BeamNG.drive an honest Review so here it goes. As you can see I have put 37.2 hrs to date actually playing the game but what you can't see is the 100 or so hours I have used in resurching diffrent aspects of the game as well and here is what I have found. For those of you that don't mind doing the reasurch involved and have a better then basic understanding of computer modeling and softwear This could be the best game in the world to own but if your like me and just want to do all the things you've seen on videos and have a imagination that keeps you up nights trying new things but can't quite figure out how to make it happen then this can be quite frustraiting at times and your not alone. Little things like picking up a car and placing it into a position all the way up to building new ramps or objects to run into or over can be quite nervracking if you don'tknow or can't figure out the map editor. Many of the YouTube video's show some pretty awsome stunts but even fewer of them will tell you how it's done. I have spen't hours looking for good tutorials but unfortunetly they are few and far between and they are often incomplete or just plain outdated and don't work withe the ever increasing number of updates. Unfortunetly when using the map editor or any other editor (they have a list) if you don't know what you are doing and are unfortunite enough to know how to get rid of it. You may find the same problem the next time you load the very same map So if there is anything I may suggest is you Back up the game the very first time you load it as well as copy all your mods to a outside folder so they can all be added at the same time should you need to reinstall the game. This was a nother lesson I leaned the hard way.\nOn the brighter side this game isn't finnished not yet and BeamNG.drive is constantly being worked on by a group of dedicated and carring induviduals from diffrent countries around the world and I've been around long enough to know that anything ever built good takes a long time to perfect. There is so many cool parts of this game and if they keep going at it with the dedication they have exhibited thus far I haven't a doubt someday thier are going to be even larger groups of gammers playing BeamNG.drive and withing they had it there game library a lot sooner. Even if your just an old Hightech junkie redneck like me It's still a lot of fun. As for you You Tubers that like to make BeamNG.drive videos when your showing something that might be new to some of us,  It's ok to show how you did it, not everyone knows what you might know so please pass the info along.

I promised one of the people at BeamNG I would give an honest review of BeamNG.drive an honest Review so here it goes. As you can see I have put 37.2 hrs to date actually playing the game but what you can't see is the 100 or so hours I have used in resurching diffrent aspects of the game as well and here is what I have found. For those of you that don't mind doing the reasurch involved and have a better then basic understanding of computer modeling and softwear This could be the best game in the world to own but if your like me and just want to do all the things you've seen on videos and have a imagination that keeps you up nights trying new things but can't quite figure out how to make it happen then this can be quite frustraiting at times and your not alone. Little things like picking up a car and placing it into a position all the way up to building new ramps or objects to run into or over can be quite nervracking if you don'tknow or can't figure out the map editor. Many of the YouTube video's show some pretty awsome stunts but even fewer of them will tell you how it's done. I have spen't hours looking for good tutorials but unfortunetly they are few and far between and they are often incomplete or just plain outdated and don't work withe the ever increasing number of updates. Unfortunetly when using the map editor or any other editor (they have a list) if you don't know what you are doing and are unfortunite enough to know how to get rid of it. You may find the same problem the next time you load the very same map So if there is anything I may suggest is you Back up the game the very first time you load it as well as copy all your mods to a outside folder so they can all be added at the same time should you need to reinstall the game. This was a nother lesson I leaned the hard way.\nOn the brighter side this game isn't finnished not yet and BeamNG.drive is constantly being worked on by a group of dedicated and carring induviduals from diffrent countries around the world and I've been around long enough to know that anything ever built good takes a long time to perfect. There is so many cool parts of this game and if they keep going at it with the dedication they have exhibited thus far I haven't a doubt someday thier are going to be even larger groups of gammers playing BeamNG.drive and withing they had it there game library a lot sooner. Even if your just an old Hightech junkie redneck like me It's still a lot of fun. As for you You Tubers that like to make BeamNG.drive videos when your showing something that might be new to some of us,  It's ok to show how you did it, not everyone knows what you might know so please pass the info along.
