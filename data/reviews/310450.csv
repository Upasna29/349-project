And I can't say that I've enjoyed myself thoroughly, can't say I can recommend it. Why? Where do I start...\n\nYou are dumped way past some imaginary beginning of the story in a cartoonish steampunky/fantasyish world, without (m)any explanation(s) and with very vague suggestions about what needs to be done. So, you save some random old "famous hunter" from a rampaging bear. Which runs away.  And then you're told to go back, find it and kill it. Oh, and some friend of yours is looking for a professor who didn't show up. And there you are, level 1-2, in the middle of a city that's a veritable metropolis compared to most cities of the genre. With hope in your heart, you go exploring. And then all that boils down to a stream of mostly empty houses "belonging" to people who supported it on Kickstarter. Which is cool, but from a gamer's selfish perspective useless, boring, time consuming and lazy. You wander from house to house hoping that someone will be there and mention something questish - because when they do (in every... say... 10th house? 8th?), it can actually be cute & original. Not always though And that's the problem with the game in its entirety. The world map is very, very big. And very, VERY empty. 98% of your time, if you have ANY sort of completist or exploratory tendencies, will be spent wandering in the middle of nowhere with too frequent interruptions from random encounters, which soon become dull, mindless "enterfests". You click the ♥♥♥♥ out of your enter key. Because there's generally no need, at least for a bigger part of the game, for much more. And it makes that huge empty (be it a forest or a plain) space even more irritating. And it feels completely unfinished. The ONLY other town you'll be able to access, Silverhead, is 3 times larger. And looks wrong and looks bad. It really could've been separated into 2-3 separate towns and make far more sense.\n\nYou'll find cute touches here & there, nice, sometimes even humorous little details/easter eggs if you wish, so it's not all that bad.\nThe game makes fun of stereotypes and illogical actions inherent to the genre, like, yeah, barging into people's homes and pillaging everything, or randomly dropped loot. It actually manages to be funny here & there. The two main characters (a fighter of sorts and a ranger of sorts) exchange cute banter - though you don't find much about them, their interaction IS charming in a way.\n\nAnd the quests can be interesting, but the lack of a proper map/description renders them frustrating. So, you need to find a guy who lives in the south of Silverhand. Cute, there's only 40 nearly identical houses you need to check there. What fun. So, you have to travel to some mountains north of Silverhand. Well, guess what, there are NO mountains north of Silverhand - the ones in question are to the east. Another quest tells you to go south of those very mountains - but you get it far earlier in the game. So you don't really know where to look. Great. And those random encounters don't help. Trust me, if you're the exploring type, like I am, reaching one edge of the map, fighting increasingly hard battles only to find a place with "very good fishing" - with exactly the same 2 kinds of fish as everywhere else... You get disappointed. Though the minigame is cute. Oh, remember that bear I mentioned? You need to bait it with fish. But it doesn't tell you which kind. And, no, it's not the ones you catch, it's one you can only get from a single store in the nearby town. Great.\n\nBack to the battles... Honestly, the only "close" battles I've had were @level 1-2, maybe a couple of random ones at the eastern edge of the map, aaand... maybe, just maybe the last battle. But I did do all the sidequests. I haven't used almost any item in battle apart from regular potions, maybe once or twice hi-potions. There's a third character, which you CAN ignore, I think, but he's a cleric of sorts, and even though the potions are plentiful, you'll need him. Items are OK enough, well balanced I guess, and you have multiple choices (the main caracter can use both swords and guns, and he has different specials for different weapons, you get to adjust which special(s) you find more usefull). Things get more interesting later on when/if you acquire summons for your two main characters, which go with prerendered animations that get boring very fast. Speaking of items... there's only one (1) shield in the entire game, and you get it through a quest. Wha?\n\nGraphics are cute and adequate, if they are really generic, from RPG Maker (can't tell), then boo, but they do their job really. The music can really be nice, but the battle theme starts grating on your nerves soon enough.\n\nI love this genre. I really do. That, and a bout of non-productive insomnia was what kept me going for hours at this game. And the promise of a story, that doesn't quite get fulfilled. Nothing more, nothing less. It's a hodgepodge of good and bad ideas, enjoyment and irritating frustration. Seemingly lazy/unfinished stuff and inspired details. Despite everything, I will likely try the Episode Two as well. But I can't recommend this to anyone outside of a bundle, especially at 10€.","December 5, 2014","false","13.6"," 49 of 52 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","49","52","2","0"

"Great stories, awesome characters, and classic monsters, with a touch of steampunk!"\n\nOr, slow-paced generic story involving a ton of back tracking and wasted time going through enormous barren towns. Characters that do get a decent bit of writing but fail to fully push the envelope or help to make the experience memorable. Classic monsters, or "RPG Maker monsters, with multiple pallet swaps for each", and steampunk again residing with only a few elements (guns, end-game enemy zeppelins, and Alyssa being from a family of tinkerer / sniper people).\n\nThe world map is horrible, entirely far too large for what little content there is; you could cut out everything but the two towns and nearby dungeons and wouldn't suffer a loss. Those two towns are, as other reviews complain, enormous and filled with empty space (kickstarter shoutouts) that hinder the game's fun.\n\nWhere the original character portraits and artwork are nice, the battle graphics are either lifted straight out of stock assets from RPGM, or are horribly muddy and blurry. Not even ripping off Phantasy Star IV's style of "behind the hero" can help it look any better than low res garbage.\n\nAnd the meat of the game, the game play? An Enter / Space fest (because gamepad support is missing) where skills are basic, enemies have tons of HP, and the best/only strategy is "Mash attack until you win".\n\nThe sidequests are either this attack mashing or "find some thing in the giant world map / towns", and honestly triple the length of the game. Without the sidequests distracting you, S&S Ep 1 is quickly over.\n\nShort, filled with ugly original and stock assets and tired gameplay mechanics, with little to break the tedium or really lift what had the potential for a really good game. Steel & Steam ain't worth the $9.99 they're asking for by a long shot. It's a shame; a lot more polish and tweaking and this could have been great.","May 4, 2015","false","8.6"," 43 of 49 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","43","49","0","0"

The story is completely predictable, and you can figure out who's the duelist just by looking at the sprite.\nAs you progress you'll find side quest to get more xp and gold avoiding the grind, and class upgrade for the companions.\nAsking 10$ for a copy pasted game than can be beaten in 3-4 hours if you avoid side quests is a insult to gamers, you shouldn't pay more than 1-2$ for this travesty than dares to say they grabbed the best elements of jrpg and combined them with a great story at the steam store, that's pure lies.","February 2, 2015","false","3.3"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","26","31","0","0"

Its hard to complain due to the cheap price, and the fact I got a free key for it. But the thing that makes me cringe in anger is the fact that this is a Kickstarter game, seriously. Its littered with nothing but premade assets from RPG Maker VX Ace. Theres barely any production value, where did all the money go to? Its not hard to develop in RPG Maker programs because I myself uses it and is making a game with all the visual assets made by me. And there was supposed to be an episode 2 or something to this game so I'm not sure whether the developers are lying and just scammed you out of the donaters' money.","September 20, 2015","false","0.1"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","20","25","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mpossehl/recommended/310450/","mpossehl","instinct_m","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mpossehl/","185 products in account","So this game is a fairly standard stab at a JRPG.\n\nPROs, the game flows fairly well, the quest system is fairly well developed and easy to follow, the storyline is actually kind of interesting, fairly standard, reminds me of Wild Arms 3 a bit honestly. The gameplay is what can be expected and the kickstarter homes in the game don't all feel like a giant waste of time since there are actually items in a few of them that make them worth going inside of.\n\nCONs, The game is far too short. This is because it was a kickstarter game and with 8500 dollars being raised for this section and whatnot, this is what was finished. I get that, that being said, this game is still a bit too short. If it someday hopes to be in 5 parts or something and offer a plethora of side quests this could have something. Straight storyline play in this game would be less than an hour or two, sidequests included this game can be completed in under 4 hours. I have so many hours on record because I leave my computer on and get up and go do things. Like clean my house, teach classes, or whatever. My playtime is not terribly reflective of time spent in game. Also this game has some very underdeveloped character interactions between party members. There are hints of actual life there but no substance. So if you are looking to fall in love with the characters you are playing with currently this game does not deliver there. The feel and everything is fine but the graphics could have been more polished.\n\nAll in all for a kickstarter effort it is good, which is why I will recommend it, but I would wait for a sale, I certainly wouldn't pay more than 5 dollars or so for the title. It is a good first effort and if you wish to support the people making it to hopefully add to it, then by all means, but if you are looking for something to fill up hours in an olde tyme JRPG style, get a FF game or something along those lines.\n\nBefore purchasing the game I had watched a first look that was done on the game that claimed the game had high levels of difficulty when reaching the mine setting. I found this report to be very false. I had no trouble killing any and all creatures I was presented with, but I am a completionist and had taken all of the side quests and completed them.\n\nGood first effort. Needs more substance. The early chapters don't feel finished, and they should when you are making an episodic game. Anways, hope that helps!","July 29, 2014","true","14.5"," 30 of 46 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","30","46","0","1"

Overall so far I think it is well done, but it does have its downsides too. I'm enjoying the story, the battle system is straightforward and more or less as expected. There are plenty of side quests available that don't particularly drag you away from the main story but provide enough xp that so far I haven't had to grind out any levels in classic RPG style.\n\nI do have a few complaints, but nothing so serious that it has kept me from enjoying the game. The first is that there doesn't seem to be a world map, which can leave you floundering for town if you wandered too far from a road and aren't exactly sure where you are. The second is that the towns simply seem way too big, about 3 times as big as they need to be. The number of houses that have nothing in them is mind-blowing, yet for those of us familiar with RPG style games we know that we MUST check every one because the one missed have a unique item or quest. This can lead to frustration if you have a few quests you do at once because unless you've got an astounding memory you may not remember exactly where you need to go to turn it in.\n\nThe music isn't particularly riveting, and gets old with time. I don't mind this at all since I tend to turn game music off in favor of streaming anyway. The story seems to be unfolding at a good pace so far. There are occasional pop culture references that are fun. (Dr. Who, Eric Clapton) If you're an absolute fan of the genre, I definitely recommend the game. If not, I can't recommend getting it outside of a sale, but it is still worth trying.","November 30, 2014","true","10.3"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","6","12","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/buttimedia/recommended/310450/","buttimedia","[G@mer]But terd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/buttimedia/","577 products in account","First try on Steel&Steam: Episode 1\n\nUpdates will be posted boldly in the respective part of the review\n\nHere is an update video concerning comments and questions about the review:\nhttp://youtu.be/UURusg9pYc8\nThe video is available here:\nhttp://youtu.be/aiQW71D1ggA\n\n\nFirst impressions on RPGs are always difficult, but I'll give it a try nonetheless.\n\nFirst off, the user defined tag "RPG Maker" is as accurate as a single tag can be. That does not necessesarily mean, you can't do great things with it as well. But first things first:\n\nThe options are not accessible via the main menu, but you can access them while playing the game. 3 different sliders for audio options are available, which is a plus.  Other than that you can change the default walking speed, the text speed from scrolling to instant and you can toggle battle animations on or off. Graphical options are not available, but this is not bothering in this case.\n\nInto the game we go and we start off with a little tutorial in which movement, interaction, inventory manangement, as well as comat are shown to you. You move around using the arrow keys and interaction works via the spacebar or the enter button. You don't really need any more than that controlwise, since the combat is turnbased.\nBut the combat is not your typical run of the mill turnbased combat. Apart from critical hits, evasion and normal hits, there are different status conditions in which you can be set by the enemy or vice versa. For example, some hits or special abilities have the potential to knock you off balance which skips your turn until you regain balance.\n\nSo, after beating the first encounter you will be teleported into the first town. I didn't count each house and every npc individually, but I have to say that for a game of this format this has been one of the largest towns I've ever seen. The same applies to the second town as well.\nIn the town you can do what you can do in RPGs: Walk into some people's house, steal their stuff and talk to the people like nothing's ever happened. Sometimes it might occur that they give you some items or even quests as well.\nAnd when you think that you have to listen(well, actually read) every dialogue, which by the way is recommended, because the dialogue is rather well written, you are mistaken. You can find the quests and their description in your controll panel.\nIn terms of the quest system I have to say the quests(side quests included) so far were rather enjoyable and I didn't expect to gain xp and gold from doing quests in a rpg like that, so I was positively surprised.\n\nThe control panel also includes your inventory and character information. Equipping your characters is relatively simple, since you have an autoequip button, which selects the best gear in terms of stats for you. Otherwise you can also equip the items yourself one by one. Other than that the inventory system is simple, but it fits its purpose.\n\n\nSo far there has been nothing negative to say, but as we progress through the main storyline we come to the point on which I start to scratch my head so hard that my scalp is coming off. By simply doing the necessary steps and encounters in the game, you gain 2-3 levels until that point, so you have your special ability. The game also gives you a healer, but not that it would matter in any way, because when you take on the 3rd quest(if I counted correctly) in the main storyline and venture towards the zone, the game suddenly turns around and gives you the finger.\nFrom enemies which you killed in 2 to a maximum of 5 turns, the encounters suddenly take 10+ turns for no apparent reason. There are even some enemies which only take an average of 15-25 damage each turn while having 300-350 hp and not being the only enemy in an encounter. What spices things up even more is the fact that their attacks deal about 33-60% of your maximum hp. I've only done one encounter which took me 10 minutes and turned off the game, because I thought it was bs.\n\n\nEither I am missing something, which is obvious to other people who are playing this game, or the balancing is completely off.\n\nSo, the tl:dr.... I cannot recommend it, I am sorry. The last point completely killed it for me.\nIf you can forgive the game for that, it might be right for you, but I can't be bothered. I might re-review it, if there is a solution to that, but at the current state, as much as it hurts, I have to give it a thumbs down.\n\nUpdate: Even after doing all the sidequests in order to see if there are balance issues, I can't recommend this game. The problem with the trashmobs before the first boss is cleared that way, but even with best in slot geared characters the boss twoshots two characters within the first 2 turns and giving me no chance to heal at all.\nI certainly hope not that the game expects you to reach an excact level before being able to kill the boss, because that would be crappy design.","July 17, 2014","false","7.1"," 47 of 94 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","47","94","3","17"

If you want to play it in windowed mode you're stuck with a tiny window. The options menu is keyboard controlled, you can't use your mouse at all.\n\nHere's my first 15 minutes of game with this: The first quest you do is save someone from being attacked by a bear. All your party can do in the beginning is a simple attack. So select person, attack, select another person, attack. Then the bear attacks. Basically a simplified final fantasy style system. The artstyle during combat is very different from the artstyle in the overworld.\n\nAfter you finished the fight the bear will run away and the man is saved. Fast forward to you going to a city and meeting up with someone. The hint was that she was in the middle of the city near the statues, except that with such a small window it's tough to tell what exactly is the middle of the city. You find the statues and there are a lot of kids, you talk to each of them only to find out that one of the kids is actually the grown woman whom you were supposed to meet with. Moving on, she says that one of the professors isnt there and asks you to find him. Fine.\n\nSo basically you run around talking to everyone. You see a fish vendor and buy a fish which is listed as a key item... It costs all the money you had meaning you have none left.\n\nYou eventually run into a guard asking you to help out with some ruffians. If you do that, and meet the ruffians you get your hiney kicked. Well great. Now your whole party is on 1 hp without any money and can't sleep to regenerate your health back because you need money.\n\nDon't buy this game unless you're into that sort of thing.","November 12, 2014","false","0.4"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","1"

Need I say more?\n\nOkay, so the game has some creativity, but it's shrouded in lame storytelling and terribly rushed game development.  The plot is interesting at times.  I like the premise of the story.  I wish it was told with more than bland RPG Maker text boxes.  There are some moments in the story which show off some nice but subtle art which distracts from the old school graphical style of RPG Maker, but I simply did not like the story and how it was told enough to overlook the awful visuals and terrible game design.\n\nThe game world is a bit blocky and obviously rushed.  The weird part is I did not know how to enter towns and other places once I arrived on the overworld level.  For the record, you reach the overworld just minutes into the story if you just walk right instead of left when you arrive at the first town.\n\nI also did not like combat.  It consisted of simply pressing fight, selecting each character, and targetting the bear over and over again.  All I did was press space over and over. How is that fun?  It isn't fun.  It's an example of how generic this game really is.  The creator probably just threw together settings in RPG Maker and fit everything to his story.  It was rushed and not well thought out.  I would have given the player some combat strategy choices or something.  Don't make combat so pointless!  If combat is going to be so easy, you may as well not even have that gameplay element at all.\n\nRedeeming factors are few and far between, but there are some good points in this game.  A lot of the NPCs have side quests and secret areas for you to explore.  There are a lot of ways you can venture off the main quest line to level up without grinding random battles, which is nice compared to games like Final Fantasy III.  There are a lot of areas to explore, as well.  As I previously stated, the overworld is a little broken, and there are a lot of areas which are rushed and look horrible, but some areas look decent, and I appreciate the work that went into the combat sprite animations and emoticons and quest log and so on.\n\nOverall, the game isn't worth buying, and the only reason I even tried it was it came with a bundle a while ago.  This isn't even a complete story.  It was never finished.  What reason do I have to continue playing it?  None.  I don't play it.  It it was 50 cents or less, it might be worth trying for its cute JRPG nature, but I would never buy it at the $9.99 it is valued at on Steam.  Hell no.","April 14, 2015","false","0.1"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"

Has a unique sountrack,characters and it's very own style.\nThough it does use the rpg maker engine it is pretty fleshed out. The only really downside of this game is the combat is repetitve as the old school rpg's so if your not in to that you might want to skip. I already own this game but bought it to show my support for a pretty solid rpg and I'm not just saying that because I'm in it lol.\nCheck out my video for the first 15 minutes or so of gameplay.","July 16, 2014","true","0.7"," 21 of 70 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","21","70","0","0"
