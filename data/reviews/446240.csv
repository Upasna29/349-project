A game about nothing. Guess I expected a little more. Most games like this would be free, or as a tech demo. Hard to review as essentially there is no real gameplay. So I guess your paying for atmosphere which is very limited as its foggy and really see nothing but the boat.\n\nBoat consists of barren wheelhouse and captains nook which is barren. Interactive items on deck limited to raising and lowering the net, or anchor, steering and speed. Don't expect to see really anything in the fog.\n\nItems brought are just msc items, gun, handcuffs, . You log that on a typewriter for what real purpose? I found none, you simply place the typed note in a bottle and throw it overboard. Reason? None really. Rinse wash repeat. They weren't kidding in the store description,  no real gameplay.\n\nSo in short your buying the atmosphere of a boat in the fog, with no real purpose in what your doing. No story arc, no explanations as to why your even doing it. Hated to go thumbs down, but there is no real value for the 10 minutes and it's over.\n\nOnly reason to rate it positive is if you got it free. Disappointing.","May 13","false","0.2"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","27","34","3","5"

In other words, a game that looks simple but unraveling into something more as you continue playing and trigger a story to unfold. In fact, that's exactly what I thought would happen when my radio blew up after I was chasing the signal.\n\nHere is the thing... that's the last even that happens in the game, and it only takes 2 minutes for that to happen.\n\nDo not purchase unless you get this game for free or you want to waste your money on a unity demo.","May 15","false","0.5"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

It's like a bad halfway-point between really cool existential gaming (where nothing is encouraged or rewarded, and the correct action is always whatever the player chooses to do) and all the other straightforward clearly-defined-goal-oriented stuff. The player that wants to relax and enjoy the experience of creating something is prevented from doing so because the developers decided that the pace at which the player discovers items must be rapid and frenzied.\n\nHowever it is absurd that the devs are even considering the feelings of the goal-oriented audience in the first place since a game like this would not in a thousand years appeal to the goal-oriented audience.\n\nSo here's my advice. Get rid of the ♥♥♥♥ing bell. Make a light that turns from red to green or something. If you absolutely must put some kind of intrusive trawl-alert, make it one that doesn't interrupt and actively discourage the entire purpose of your game. Also the list that is permanently overlaid on the typewriter pages grows over time, so if you discover too many items you can't see what you're typing anymore. Fix that, too. Oh, and there's a bug where the bell triggers even if you haven't put the trawl out, so you can just sit at the typewriter and write spam and spawn discovered items non-stop.\n\nI paid six bucks for the opportunity to give you my honest feedback so I hope you appreciate it. But I really do like the concept of the game.","May 19","true","0.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's more like a tool if you want to be doing some creative writing. I think it is really neat. The way the waves splash around you in the lonely night while you sit down in your cabin writing on an old typewriter! The best part is, that the "game" saves everything you wrote to a folder in your Documents section. Meaning, you can recover the things you write. If you have some money to spend, I absolutely reccomend this game. If you don't like to write, don't buy it.","May 14","true","0.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

The controls were like any other game smooth and the game ran well I just feel like one play through was enough for me and I didnt see $6 value. Ill give the game a thumbs up becuase while the game wasnt for me I can see how some people may enjoy the game and in all honesty it wasnt buggy and did play well.\n\nAnyway check out my video and make up your own mind :D\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3QJPgVwZPM\n","May 13","true","0.3"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","55","17","31","8","0"

Expect and be ready for that, and you'll likely have a very good experience.  Or more accurately, you may have a real writing experience.  Feeling good about your writing can be hard.  Trawl puts you in an imagined space where distractions have been reduced.  It calms you and then gives you a focus for your thoughts.  It is minimalist because it needs to leave room for you.","May 14","true","0.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I found I was writing my own narrative and on the second play through I started imaging scenarios where I was going to be attacked by HP Lovecraft’s Deep Ones.\n\nThe two main mechanics in my opinion are the typewriter and your imagination. The typewriter gives you an outlet for your imagination to run wild whilst stranded on a tiny Trawler. The mood is set by the creaking of the boat against the waves, also the ringing of the bell whilst you have gone below to add to your notes.\n\nExtremely interested to know if the letters in the bottle are saved, would be great to read other users letters.","May 13","true","0.8"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","8","16","0","0"

There isn't a flashy tutorial, or a deep story.  Instead you simply come to on the deck of a trawler, surrounded by the endless void of ocean.  The game invites you to experiment and poke around.\n\nFor less than a fiver, you can trawl the depths in hopes of seeing something exciting in your net once pulled aboard, place them around your ship, and keep a captain's log of your ramblings.\n\nThere is no real ending to each play-through, but the game's simplicity draws you back to look for what else is out there.  The endless rain sets a surprisingly relaxing environment which makes just being in trawl an almost meditative experience worth checking out.\n\nWould definitely recommend to almost anyone.\n\nETA:  Thought I should mention that I am close friends with the developer of this game although that hasn't swayed my opinion at all","May 13","true","0.2"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"
