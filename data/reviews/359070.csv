I'm not joking.\nThis game pretend to has a Story and acts like survival game. But actually It has none of them.\nSince Game has only 3 quest. and which can beat in 3 min,\nhunger system is totally useless. you beat the 3 quest and game is over.\n\n*Clap Clap. I usally able to see game's true aspect (sucked game or not sucked game) through trailer and description.\nI failed this time.\nWell played.","March 25, 2015","false","1.6"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","24","31","4","0"

This is that, in a 2D game. Every sprite has a different DPI on screen, it feels like.\n\nAlso the text apparently only looked good on the original testing resolution; it scales badly.\n\nRetro or "low-quality" art is fine, just see undertale or nidhogg. The random inconsistancy is what kills it.\n\nThe controls are kinda sticky, at least in switching to movement to the right.\n\nI didn't get much past the stew, but other reviews seem to indicate that I've already seen about half the game. Short games are fine, but...\n\nThe writing is also slightly off. Not bad-bad, but if you're putting something up for sale... try to get someone with at least a slight college level expereince in proofing and copyediting to go over it -- someone who didn't write it. Given the amount of text between the game, the website, and steam itself, I'd guess that's maybe a half hour's work.\n\nThe less text you have the more important it is to get it right.\n\nAll in all it looks like a good first finished game project from a new dev, but I just keep asking myself, why is it on steam?","March 23","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
