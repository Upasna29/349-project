Good music.\n- Puzzles are clever and needs team work.\n- It really needs cooperative work, so will help to improve team communication.\n- You dont need any controller to play, a keyboard is just enough for both players.\n- Online coop just works fine just as local coop, so you wont face connection problem when playing with friend through internet.\n- You can still play it alone but it'll be so hard without friend (so i recommend to get one lol)\n\nNEGATIVE\n-None\n\nIt's one of the best coop games I've ever seen and totally recommend to pick this up. Full price might be too much, but you can buy it on sale.\n\n\n\nSuggestion for devs: It would be a great if you guys add a mini extra football mode to just play it casual. I loved kicking those little creatures, it could be a great extra soccer minigame.

This game, however, is a part of a whimsical challenge attributed to the integrity of the friendship with the person you chooce to play it with. I have decided to play with a person I trust in the game world and not just a random ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• that wants to tell me what to do. These challenges, with your friend, are overcome through communcation with a mouse-trail of bubbles (or microphone lol) follow by lots of facedesk slamming, frustration, screen cracking, mouse breaking and blood-curdling, nightmarish bouts of war with the developers indirect laughs in your face. It is a brutal level design for each of the areas and even the smartest people lack common sense, I took a while to write this review because, this friend I chose, we both need breaks and a mutual time to participate in this game. It is well worth it and not only does it build onto the integrity of your friendship, but it creates hatred for self; the realization that one is not always the brightest and when you do finally realize something, how hard it is to communicate it.","June 11, 2015","true","7.2"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","14","15","5","0"

I bought this in a sale but I would say it's worth the full price as you will have so much fun with it!\n\nThis is a nice and fun game to play with a friend or a loved one as it is a fun puzzle solver. You will enjoy playing it even more if you play while using a microphone in multiplayer.\nIt took me and my boyfriend 20 hours to complete, including doing the achievements. The 'Quality Time' achievement took awhile to get but it was fun trying to do that. We both enjoyed playing this and had a lot of fun dying!\nThe levels start off easy and then the later levels become frustrating and a little harder but if you keep trying you will eventually do it. We both got stuck on some puzzles for awhile but we figured it out by helping each other.\nIt is quite interesting and hard to find all the hidden crystals and getting the highest possible score on all levels, but there are guides that can help you with that.\nIn the game you can move your mouse and some paint follows which I thought is a good to show the person you're playing with if you had an idea. Also, when you finish a level ibb & obb do a dance which I found adorable.\nThe whole of the game is bright and colourful, and it is worth playing it to the end and finishing the entire game!\nibb & obb are both cute, little characters, the emoticons and backgrounds are also cute.\n\nThe only negative I'd have to say is that the last few levels were really difficult for me and I made my boyfriend do most of the bits because I couldn't, I probably would of if I practiced over and over.

The soundtrack is amazing in my opinion, if you want to pay the extra few dollars for the soundtrack with the game, then I recommened you do so. The game does require a lot of co-op but, with a friend it's very fun, using voice chat would be easier in case people get stuck, but if you really enjoy the music in game you may as well try without it and it's kind of cute without voice chat cause you have to guide one another.\n\n10/10 for me, the secret levels can be challenging (personal interest, took a couple of hours to do them all), worth playing with a friend who enjoys puzzle co-op, and music is really enjoyable to listen to.","May 27, 2014","true","70.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I highly recommend buying the 2-pack bundle and to play with a friend.\n\nThe game is kind of a physics puzzle platformer. It is self-explanatory, from the first to the last stage you will see new elements being introduced in a way that requires no further explanation. It's intuitive and fun to explore the new elements.\n\nThe music in this game is a highlight. It matches the clean, calming artstyle perfectly and fits the athmosphere of the stages perfectly. Get the soundtrack if you can, you won't regret it.\n\nThe replay-value of this game is ok. As long as you have more friends to play it with, there will always be one who you can introduce to this game and trying to get 100% of the crystals and secret stages with them is just as fun as trying it for the first time.\n\nWhat I dislike is that the audio volume resets every time you start the game, it's far too loud. Also, when playing with friends from overseas, the game suffers heavily from lag - not really the games fault, but I found that to be annoying sometimes, anyway.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played it yet and who has a friend to play this together with. I could imagine that single player is too hard, as you'd have to control both characters at once, but maybe you'll like the challenge of that, too.","January 16","true","26.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I was, however, often very confused by the puzzles! Which is a very good thing! My coop partner and I thoroughly enjoyed working together to solve puzzles and get the platforming tricks done. It's very satisfying to finally get through a puzzle and get to that party at the end of the level! There were even times when we got a bit snippy with each other because of the level of cooperation needed to get through. If you're considering buying this, just do it. I loved it.

They also use very frequent mini check points, so you don't have to start a whole level over.\n...\nBut then it digresses into really tricky timing platforming with multiple challenging tasks in timed sequenses and the fun sort of drains off to exaspiration. Put another way, when you know how to solve a puzzle but they needlessly have easy to fail tight timing/positioning things that all have to be done as one continuous chain where either person can fail, and have to do it all over again. I think I'd rather play something else at that point.\n\nIf you really really love tricky platforming (both pricision/timing and intelectualy challenging), you may really like this game.

I'm not sure if it's even possible to play it alone.\n\nAlso, the hidden levels bring a really nice touch to the game.\n\nThe game is hard to play though, it's not easy, especially when you also want to complete the hidden levels, which are even harder than the normal game.\n\nWhat I also like about this game, is that it is developped by two Dutch companies, which I like, because I am Dutch.

At least the level 5 badge and the foil badge. The level badges below 5 I forgot about, so not talking about those. Also, the game has really nice emoticons, that you could get when crafting the badges. Especially the emoticon: :pinkheart:.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/auldwolf/recommended/95400/","auldwolf","AuldWolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/auldwolf/","423 products in account","I wish I could recommend this game, but there are issues which cannot be ignored. I can't in good conscience say that someone should get this game until they're fixed. I will admit though that some of these issues are due to being disabled, which will result in some hate (because as we know the only people who like disabled people are disabled people), but I need to talk about this.\n\nScreen Zooming\n\nI have poor sight, so when the screen suddenly zooms way out I find it easy to lose track of my character, or I'll get vertigo and my precision will be off. In a game with online multiplayer, this kind of zooming is unnecessary and only serves to irritate the player. An online game should use a set zoom (with the zoom level in the options). A pointer could point the position of the other character. This wouldn't really require much extra code as there's a pointer that tracks the other player in-game right now (if one player goes too high off screen, it'll show the position of the player lower down), which makes this even more baffling.\n\nIf this were fixed for online games, it would make the experience much more enjoyable. As it is, the constant stretching and shrinking, stretching and shrinking, stretching and shrinking makes me feel nauseous. I understand that a temporary zoom to show what you need to do may sometimes be necessary, but just trigger that then have the zoom go away. Or even give the player a 'zoom out' toggle key which they can use whenever they want.\n\nBut making it zoom and zip around like mad makes it feel like a Ubisoft game where the controls are so often stolen away. This would be a much, much, much more playable experience if this was fixed.\n\nCollectibles\n\nI have an anxiety disorder. Whenever I fail to get collectibles, I feel like I've failed my co-op partner. For some people, this is exciting, exhilarating, and fun. For me, it results in my heart racing, pounding, and feeling faint and panicky. That sense of panic will grow and my hands will start shaking. Combine this with the above issue and I find ibb & obb (especially on the harder levels) a genuinely unpleasant play experience.\n\nThis could be fixed by having an option so that they don't decay. I know that there are some nutty, obsessive cheevo-hunters out there who're hardcore or no-core, so just disabled the Steam achievements tied in with collectibles if the co-op partners agree to turn on the option to stop the collectibles from decaying. That way, it's an option, which doesn't hurt anyone, and the hardcore cheevo-hunters can have their hadcore cheevo-hunting.\n\nAs it is, though, the decay makes this a stressful experience. Otherwise, it would be a pleasant, enjoyable, serene, cerebral experience. It would be more like Portal 2, then. I love Portal 2, standing around and trying to figure out a test chamber without the immediate pressure of ermahgerd I stepped on a thing, now the collectibles are going to decay, whatever will I do? So I won't be playing much more ibb & obb due to this.\n\nOf course, this means that the collectibles will stick around if you die, too. I know, gosh, such a carebear. But I'm an old fart with disabilities, I'm not 15 any more. We can't all be perfect.\n\nIt just really, really frustrates me because I could see the potential of this as a serene puzzler, it could be in my top ten with the likes of Myst and Portal, but this silly, ridiculous design decision to cause stress and anxiety for no good reason just does so, so much to ruin the game. And it does ruin the game. And it is stupid. And it does stop it from reaching its potential. I just want to shake some sense into the developers, because it could be so much more. It's so close to being an epic cult classic for the ages.\n\nGame Syncing\n\nThis may not be fixable, but it's a very serious issue. It also triggers my panic in various ways.\n\nWay 1:\n\n"You didn't get the collectibles."\n"Yes. I did. I really did."\n"No, you didn't. I saw them explode all over the place and you didn't even bother with them."\n"But ... I caught the ball before it exploded."\n"Not on my end."\n"I did on my end, honest! I caught it!"\n"Have you seen me ignoring collectibles?"\n"Yeah, but I didn't want to say..."\n"Welp, that's a bug."\n\nWay 2:\n\n"You need to get rid of this porcupine."\n"I did. I did that a while ago, and the collectibles popped out. I saw you get some of them."\n"...none of this happened."\n"I think it's bugging again. Here, let me come back. Is this where the porcupine is?"\n"Yes."\n"It can't harm me..."\n"Look, it'll kill me."\n"Well damn. How do we fix this?"\n"Keep trying until it works, I guess?"\n\nIt took me and one co-op partner some time to figure out that there were syncing errors. I'm very hesitant to play it with any of my other friends as we'd have to go through this again and again, with each new person playing. This isn't my idea of a fun time. The game should at least mention that these bugs can occur when booting the game if they can't be fixed. It causes a lot of friction between co-op partners.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis very flawed gem has the potential to become the next Portal 2, one of the best co-op puzzle experiences on Steam, perhaps even the best co-op experience on Steam. But the first of these two issues need to be fixed, the latter should be fixed, but if extenuating circumstances don't allow it, at least warn co-op partners that it can happen to alleviate potential stress.\n\nThis could be good. Could be. As it is, it makes me a bag of stress with shaky hands. I can't help but dislike it for that. I don't want too. I want to like it. But the way I feel about it means that I can't recommend it.\n\nIt's great if you have perfect sight, motor control, and no anxiety. It's great if you can put up with the game sync issues without getting stressed. In that case? I recommend it without reservation, go ahead, it's the most fun you can have with co-op puzzling outside of Portal 2. But for anyone whom these may be an issue for? No.\n\nNo. I just can't recommend this. I want to, but I can't. Please fix these issues so that I can recommend ibb & obb. I really, really want to.","February 16, 2015","false","2.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Overall the puzzles are pretty cool and very reasonable, but I got stuck a few times in the endlevels, knowing what to do, but failing for 20 minutes straight.\nLag can destroy a persons timing too. I played with a person on the other side of the world and sometimes we had to try a few times because the lag would get the better of his timing.\nOther than that the world is beautiful and the mousemovements making lines to show the other person what he needs to do is very simple and works perfectly fine.

This game has fun puzzles to try to solve  cooperatively with your friend (local or online) in order to progress through the levels while trying to collect as many points (little white squares that shoot out of enemies) as possible. Even if puzzle games aren't really your cup of tea, this game is still pretty fun just to screw around in (especially trying to squash the miniature ball-dudes first).

As a fan of the genre myself, I can say I look often. This game stood out for it's art style, co-op, and simplicity.\n\nWhen it comes to puzzle platformers, ibb & obb uses a recently popular mind-bending alteration on physics. Many of its peer platformers have also used dual or mirrored characters, but not quite in this same way. In those, you the player are able to control both. Here, each character must fend for himself, but also cooperate to succeed. It has taken cues from the co-op element of Portal, but is still self-contained.\n\nWhile I typically don't enjoy platformers in the genre, this was an exception. Simplicity is key, and the developers executed it very well. It doesn't remain the same throughout, and there is clear progression in the art, but it's always minimal, clean, and fresh. The smooth dream-like artistry behind it, including the music, is excellent and I applaud it.\n\nThere is hardly any story, which is fine with this game, and what exists is only shown visually, and you are up to interpret it. It's not as integral, but makes for a neat dynamic if you think about it. I think this part could be developed further. While it's clean, and I like that, it's not overly progressed. It appears, and then goes nowhere. Because of this, it doesn't stick with you long after you play. It's good and lovely mental and cooperative exercise, but not much more.\n\nThe puzzle difficulty is variable, and you can choose to pursue more challenging ones that don't hinder you from the main drive. Co-op makes this a lot of fun, as you decipher these physics traps together. It's a good communication and team-building exercise also. It certainly delivers on mental puzzlers, and if you enjoy them, I recommend it to you.","January 1, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a similar experience to what we had playing Portal 2 co-op, occasionally hurting our brains trying to solve a puzzle and then facepalming when it becomes blatantly obvious (after you've spent 15 mins trying to solve it of course). ibb & obb actually has us both in tears a few times, just dying with laughter as we repeatedly fail jumps and die to the Studio Ghibli-esque wandering soots.\n\nThe graphics are PHENOMENAL - the simplicity of it all works so well and the vibrant colours make me so happy. Even the darker levels were executed so well and add to the game: You have just enough vision so that it doesn't hinder you playing (like so many other games where you can't see 2 inches in front of your face) and it's fun not being able to see the soots. Nothing like a spikey lil surprise to make your day eh?\n\nNot gonna lie, I normally rage a bit while playing platformer/repeatedly dying games. Like I said earlier I've had the exact opposite happen..I cry with laughter when we keep dying. The whole atmosphere of the game is very zen-like and relaxing, and the gameplay is just so fun (lots of wooshing and sounds are made while flying through the sky) that I haven't raged or gotten annoyed whatsoever..which is great. :)\n\nCan't recommend this game highly enough. What're you waiting for go grab a friend! And if you don't have any friends...you should rent one for a day just so you can play this game.

I don't ordinarily write reviews, but I like this game so much that I wanted to spread the word.\n\n\nThe basics:\n\nIn Ibb & Obb, you are in a world that has an unusual form of gravity.  If you look at the screenshots, you can see that there is a line that roughly divides the playfield into a top and bottom.  When you are above this line, gravity works how you would expect.  When you are below it, you "fall" up, towards the line.  (In other words, you're always attracted to the line.)  You can only switch sides at the various gates in the level (the particle-y lines in the pictures).  ORdinarily these gates are white, but some gates are red or green.  Anyone can go through a white gate, but only the character that matches the color of the gate can pass through the red and green ones.\n\nThe challenge comes from cooperating with your partner to solve the puzzles.  This often requires making clever use of your momentum when switching from one side to the other.  As you can see in the video, enemies can be killed on one side of the line, but the player on the other side has to collect the gems.\n\n\nWhat I like:\n\nThis game is gorgeous.  I find the colors to be very satisfying, and I find the overall art style to be very pleasant.  Obviously not everyone may agree, but I want to really commend the developers for making such a stylish game.\n\nSame thing for the music.  Pretty much as soon as the game started, I thought, "Wow, this music is great."  I never really stopped thinking that.\n\nThe gameplay is also fun.  The puzzles start off fairly simply to introduce you to the mechanics, then start to become a little trickier.  This is especially true once you realize that there are optional gems floating around in some places - getting these requires more thought than simply figuring out how to beat the level.  So far, the puzzles are hard enough that you feel satisfied when you beat them, but not so hard that you ever get frustrated.\n\nI'd also like to mention the way this game is packaged.  You can buy a single copy, and it would be a fair price, but for slightly more money you can buy a double pack and gift a copy to a friend.  This game is definitely meant to be played with a friend, and the devs make it very easy to do that by so strongly incentivizing the double pack.\n\n\nWhat I don't like:\n\nHonestly, I don't have any complaints so far.  I've really been enjoying this game.\n\n\nWhat I don't know:\n\nI'm not sure how long the game is.  That information might be available, but I haven't really checked.  Given how reasonably priced the game is, especially with a double pack, I don't feel like it would have to be super long for me to get my money's worth.  I'll update this if I end up beating it in 15 minutes the next time I play, but I haven't even seen all the areas highlighted in the screenshots, so I don't expect that to happen.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nI highly recommend this game.  It's beautiful, fun, and clever.  I only wish that I'd heard about it sooner!","January 13","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And you play it in cooperation with a buddy. What's not to like?\n\nThe puzzles are challenging not only in regard to their solution. They often require both players to perfectly execute several steps in a row, with very little room for error. This can mean that you have already figured out the solution and make it halfway there but then you misstep: Start over. Then, your friend is too fast: Start over. Then, you jump a little too early:  Start over. Then, your friend hits an enemy: You know the drill. Solving a puzzle can get quite tedious.\nAnother issue is savegames: One level took us up to an hour (in the later stages), depending both of how well we could crack the puzzle logic and execute the steps. During that, the game saved our progress just fine; if we failed a puzzle, we'd only be back at its beginning. But whenever we had to quit before finishing the level (or had a desync or just didn't feel like trying the same puzzle for the umpteenth time), the next time, we'd have to restart the whole level from the beginning.\nFinally, playing it with a friend across the ocean, we found that in-game voice chat was delayed by a few seconds. Maybe it doesn't happen with less of a distance between you and your co-player. For us, it didn't help, what with some puzzles needing near-perfect timing. Towards the end, we thought about using an external solution like Raidcall, but it never came to that.\nOverall, the game can get quite frustrating.\n\nBefore this, we played Portal 2, which did a better job of e.g. the savegame issue by having many smaller levels, so if you had to quit at some point, you wouldn't have to replay as much as in this game. And there, when you already knew the steps leading up to where you'd left off, they were usually pretty easy to reproduce. If you're looking for a fun coop puzzler, I'd rather recommend Portal 2.","November 15, 2015","false","14.4"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mysocks/recommended/95400/","mysocks","Valex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mysocks/","1137 products in account","Ibb & Obb is a gravity-based puzzle-platformer.\n\nWhich isn't to say you manually adjust gravity, as with some games, but that the entire game is composed of things like 'slow fall bubbles', trampolines, looped falling (where you drop from the sky after falling off the bottom of the screen), and reverse-gravity wells.\n\nDespite fairly simple concepts, the puzzles quickly move from charming and cute and simple, to demanding and clever.\n\nUnlike twitch/reflex platformers, once you actually figure out the trick to a puzzle, you're good to move on, which makes this a game more about testing your wit, than your reflexes- though timing is certainly important, as well.\n\nIbb & Obb is one of the best co-op experiences I've had in a while, and I can certainly recommend it-\nThough there's some things I unfortunately have to point out.\n\n||PROS||\n* Co-op only play guarantees an experience built with co-op in mind at all facets.\n\n* Puzzles are based around clever reuses of a small set of objects, presented in more and more complex ways, thus creating a steadily progressing experience where you build off what you've learned from your previous successes, rather than having to start each puzzle from scratch.\n\n* Ibb & Obb (the two player-controlled characters in the game) are different sizes. This can have some interesting effects on gameplay, and is actually crucial to later puzzles. It's a nice twist that keeps each co-op partner feeling distinct in their roles. Similarly, the use of color-coded barriers limits which character can progress at points, creating interesting 'how do we both progress' puzzles.\n\n* Looped falling can be surprisingly hilarious\n\n* You can 'bend the system' by attempting crazy mid-air combos, such as trying to jump off your partner as they loop-fall. This can sometimes provide alternative ways to solve puzzles, for players that enjoy precision-reflex approaches over puzzle approaches. But really, it'll take quite a few attempts to do- though it's quite satisfying when you manage it.\n\n* Charming atmosphere, and the most adorable little interactables- that you can actually push into enemies to cause the enemies to change course, or bounce onto enemy killing buttons, or just kick around like soccer balls, sometimes to absolutely hilarious effect. Great little tidbit for more creative puzzle solving, and just general palate cleansing.\n\n* The ability to aim for a perfect score, by gathering all the enemy-kill score drops, for the more dedicated completionists.\n\n||NEUTRAL||\n* Secret stages are brutal and difficult to intuit, and may be best skipped by all but the most dedicated mental gymnasts.\n\n* This game gets hard. It looks like it's designed for kids, but most kids won't have the patience to complete this kid of game [and if you know one that does, give them a cookie, they're awesome].  This is definitely a game for the patient and the people who really like working through problems until they understand them.\nIf you're into really puzzle-oriented games, enjoy teamwork, and physics manipulation, you're going to probably like this game. If your expectations run toward something more- or less- active in involvement, you may not.\n\n\n* Similarly, puzzles will require several attempts to figure out, and at the time we played, all the walkthroughs were for the console version (which has different stages, see Cons below). Plus side, every time we got stuck and needed an assist, it was us overthinking a puzzle, so there's that. :)\nStill, patience is a virtue- and one you may need to rely on for this game.\nThen again, you'll still die less, hate yourself less, and feel far less frustrated than with twitch/reflex platformers, so there's that~\n\n* Relatively short. 6 to 7 hours without the last level (see Cons), but that's mostly due to repetition in figuring out each puzzle. The core content is probably 2-3 hours in length, assuming a run-through where you know what you're doing.\n(Secret levels will of course extend this time a bit further, if you choose to do them.)\n\n||CONS||\n\n* The last level is broken on the PC port- or rather, several levels got reimagined for the PC port (which is kinda cool) but the reimagining of the last level caused it to be incompletable (which is kinda not cool).\nThe game plays fine up to that point, so if you're able to view the end of the game being a level sooner, you'll be fine-\nIf you're a completionist, this screw-up may drive you up a wall.\nEspecially with given how demanding the prior level was- you can only imagine how awesome this final level could have been..\n\n* No mid-level save points, so you're forced to complete a stage to make progression in it.\n[Each puzzle section within a stage does have its own respawn point, however.]\nPlus side, once you know the puzzles, you can breeze through if you need to leave and restart- still, this feels like an unfortunate and arbitrary exclusion.\n\n* Likewise, this game seems to have low replay value, given that non-campaign-level challenges (ie, secret levels) are all extreme in challenge, and all puzzles in the game are fairly easy to complete once you know how to do them.\n\n\nThis is a bit of a difficult game to describe, but if you like undertaking a mental challenge with a partner, and neither of you are the type to get agitated when you get stuck, then it's a fantastic game I recommend highly.\n\nAs always with co-operation games of this nature, if either person gets easily stressed, expect eventual argument and rage-quitting.\nDespite that phrasing, it's not an especially frustrating game (in MY opinion), since everything CAN be figured out through rethinking and continously retesting your approach to a puzzle.\n\n\nStill, it's a bit niche in its challenge, a bit curious in how certain things (like secret levels) are approached, and, of course, the last level cannot be played.\n\nSo..\nI tentatively give it a 4/5.\n\nSeriously, if it sounds at all good to you, give it a shot- and if it sounds at all not good to you, don't. ~.^","November 29, 2015","true","7.7"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

But playing ibb & obb is like petting a dog and having it bite your fingers off. It's cuteness is equally matched if not exceeded by its degree of frustrating, nonsensical design decisions, to where my head began to hurt so much I'm not sure how I ever managed to complete the trek through hell that was somehow hiding below the delightful exterior.\n\nJust to be entirely clear, ibb & obb is coop only, meaning you better have a friend ready and willing to brave its horrors with you before you even press start. And to this point there are some pretty cool ideas buried here, which force you to play cooperatively and make clever use of its main gravity inverting hook. There are two sides to every level, with each flipping your character over like you've cut a hole straight through to the other side of the world and gravity hasn't yet realized.\n\nUsing both characters in tandem is almost always required to allow both to progress, be it providing a step up onto a ledge or using momentum to carry each other through. It's a fantastic hook but its implementation here is unbelievably hamstrung and convoluted. The camera that has to contend with two characters often going in opposite directions bears much of the blame, often obscuring parts of the environment or even your character entirely as you fight against it to keep moving as it holds you back. The pretty environments come at the const of making levels difficult to even comprehend, often blending so well with platforms or bubbles I needed to float in that I often had no idea they were something I needed to interact with.\n\nPuzzle designs, while on occasion genuinely brilliant, are often constructed such a ridiculous manner that numerous times throughout the game I thought we were breaking the game finding their solutions. So many moments are needlessly tedious and absurdly challenging, forcing literal split-second timing which its floaty, imprecise controls make cumbersome at the best of times and a living nightmare at its worst. Each new mechanic introduced only seems to worsen the already overburdened experience, leaving exasperated and fatigued before I was even halfway through. The abundance of network lag (which from what I've gathered is by no means an isolated issue) made parts of the game nearly impassible, as if the game was at last telling me to give up as my character ran wildly around at his own inclination.\n\nThe dissonance between ibb & obb's truly marvelous artwork and mellow soundtrack and it's reprehensible gameplay is probably one of the most shocking I've ever experienced. It's bewildering and depressing, and I'm still finding it hard to fathom how miserable an experience it was to play when it all seemed so wonderful from the outside.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","January 6, 2015","false","4.7"," 23 of 46 people (50%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","50","23","46","6","3"

It looked like the kind of game that would start off good then become too frustrating and it is always difficult to say whether or not it would remain fun for long enough for the game to be worth getting. I gave this game a chance anyway because local coop games are so few are far between. So how long did it take to for this game to get annoying and frustrating? Twenty minutes‚Ä¶ yes after only three levels this game had exhausted it capacity for fun. The game requires a degree of coordination between the players that was way beyond my partner and I. After my partner gave up on this game I attempted to play a bit more on my own but this game has no single player mode, you can play controlling both characters but again this requires a level of coordination I don't possess. There is also online play but if I couldn't muster the required level of hive mind communication with my partner on the sofa next to me then I how am I going to manage it with some random on the internet? So if you are a member of the Borg collective looking for a challenging game to play with a fellow drone, this might be the game for you. If you are looking for a bit of casual fun with friend this is probably not the game for you.","May 14","false","4.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","1","3","3","1"

You play as some sort of mushroom-blob, guiding your respective mushroom-blob friend to the exit of the levels. It sounds like a simple puzzle game formula that has been tried before.\n\nHowever, this puzzle game manages to set itself apart. In the very short time I have played it, I have found the game incredibly fluid and polished, the art and animation smooth and fitting to the core gameplay, and the gameplay itself fantastic. It's the kind of game you can pick up and play with a friend so easily, and then can't put down.\n\nThe puzzles start out seemingly easy, but continue to get trickier and trickier. The lack of communication besides what you can waggle out with your mouse only adds to the fun, and you'll probaby find yourself either laughing hysterically or screaming frustratedly as one of you grasps the puzzle while the other does not. I can imagine having an unskilled/trolling teammate would somewhat diminish this experience, but if you're in the right mindset, with the right teammate, you'll have a blast.\n\nTL;DR: 9/10. One of my favorite puzzle games I've ever played. Hope to see more.","July 22, 2014","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

If you want to find something to do on a Friday night, I'd recommend that you bash yourself in the head with a hammer rather than play this game.

More places than not, I had long figured out the solution before managing to actually apply the hand to eye coordination necessary to proceed through the level. In many places there were challenges that involved precise timing to avoid enemies.\n\nThe other thing to note however is that this game, I believe, is the only game from steam in which I‚Äôve never gotten a single achievement on.

From what other reviewers wrote, it doesn't even work properly via LAN.\nIf it were couch coop only, I'd moan that there's no online MP, but as it stands, I have to moan that the online MP isn't very good. Later levels are just about impossible due to the atrocious lag / delay and random erratic AI behaviour resulting from this.\n\nI sure like the comparably cheap two pack offer, but the bugginess / glitchiness as well as frequent reliance more on perfect timing than clever thinking prevents me from giving this game a positive review. Unlike it apparently was the case for other reviewers, my 1.5 hours of playing time did not include 'lightbulb moments' where I was mesmerised by the developers' astonishingly intricate puzzle design. At all. As far as challenging players with pattern memorisation and perfect timing goes, there are various games on Steam that make far far better use of those gameplay elements (SMB, Rush Bros and I assume Electronic Super Joy as well as SpeedRunners).\n\nGive this game a look if you engage in regular single PC dual gamepad multiplayer games, or if you happen to have a lot of patience for a game's issues when it comes to playing online with a close friend.\n\nP.S.: Voice communication is a must for all but the first few puzzlies. Not gonna be any jolly if you can't communicate while you play.\n\nP.P.S.: When you're STUCK SOMEWHERE due to the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• LEVEL DESIGN, it's impossible to kill yourself to restart from the last automatic save point.

My partner is teleporting really badly and sometimes the crystals you have to collect are shown as collected for him but splitted on the ground for me, and in the end we didn't get all cause of that.\n\nI really hope you can fix that problem cause then this will definitely turn into a positive review.","May 28, 2014","false","5.3"," 8 of 29 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","8","29","0","2"

Grab 2 xbox 360 controllers and play on the same screen, or 2 copies of the game to play online. (Voice chat might be needed). It is also worth noting how relaxing this game is. Death isn't a punishment, but more of a reminder that you should be working together. The soundtrack is also superb with just the right ammount of imersion.

The horizon mechanic where one or both players can occupy the upper or lower portions of the level is fun and adds a little bit of flavor to your standard platformer.\n\nIt also implements a light level of physics as jumping through gateways retains momentum a la Portal.

After playing this with one of my friends, I have to say that this is an extremely fun platforming game, that is both relaxing and difficult.\n\nThings I loved about the game:\n- Visual Quality (it is so smooth and the particles effects are awesome).\n- Puzzles (The start of the game was quite easy, but once you played through, the puzzles took me a while to think of what to do).\n- Using momentum to beat puzzles (it's so satisfying).\n\nProblems I had with the game:\n- A little bit laggy when playing with a friend (that might just be my internet, although other games are fine when I play them).\n- Voice chat in game is a 2 second delay (but you will probably use Skype, Tamspeak etc. anyway).\n\nI would give this a solid 9/10.

The smooth, colorful environment fits the game very well, and the music has a very relaxing tone (most of the time).\n\nThe only thing that is stopping me from giving this game a perfect score is that there is one particular puzzle that is great at first, but later gets used again annoyingly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jamkablam/recommended/95400/","jamkablam","JamKaBlam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jamkablam/","68 products in account","Ibb & Obb is a delightful indie co-op platforming experience but you need a buddy to play along with. It's strictly a co-op game, so that means either playing with a good friend or with random players. Like classic platforming, you run to the right and overcome obstacles together, the twist being that you have the ability to walk underneath the floor, parallel to the top. Many of the puzzles and enemies must be solved by using this ability, with one player being on top of the world and one underneath. There have been times where we have been stumped at how to progress thanks to this clever little mechanic. Momentum and jumping physics also play parts in the challenges for you to utilize. The game isn't the longest in the world, 3 hours and more for the secrets and collectibles scattered and hidden throughout. Visually, it's simple, using highly vectored and clean graphics with simple enemy design. You will see alot of back drops and paths being re-used with the difference being colours and ambience. The difficulty is pretty tame until the late stages which then ramps up like a bridge. Not a bad thing but you'll find yourself suddenly hitting a wall and being stuck.\n\nAlthough I have only played with a friend, i can see this being a difficult time with random players. You might have trouble with players who lack patience or rush ahead leaving you behind. There is no in game chat that I know of, with the only intstructions you can give is by moving the mouse around to draw lines and paths if you're trying to show how to progress.\n\nOverall, 3/5.","June 29, 2014","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A co-op game at its core, this indie puzzle gem is a perfect thing to take when you wanna make friends with someone or reinforce your friendship with them. Get a double pack if you both don't have own a copy of the game yet, it's just a few euros above the individual game's price, but it's totally worth it. You're bound to have a great time, I'm tellin' you!\n\nThe controls are nice and fluid, the graphics are cute and eye-relaxing. Many of the puzzles are challenging and require close cooperation from you to beat 'em and go through. Some of the puzzles may evn take half an hour or more of brainstorming, but you won't really find it as a drag thanks to the lovely, soothing sountrack. The gameplay may last 7 hours, but it'll take you much more if you're into getting a great score at every stage and the achievements are pretty hard to get.\n\n9/10, totally recommended!","August 1, 2014","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game provides no way to synchronize actions other than skill alone. It does not feature hand holding countdown timers through a button press nor gameplay elements favoring synchronization.\n\nThe directional controls feel like there is something uncanny about the acceleration rate, inertia and friction.\n\nThe above combined makes it so that several puzzle elements are frustrating because they are non deterministic. A slight variation in position or momentum will cause your character to move in various ways with a difficult to predict outcome, meaning that a puzzle section has to be attempted many many many times before any success, even if you already know how the puzzle is meant to be solved.\n\nSome puzzles will require one specific player to execute one specific part of a puzzle. There are sometimes an urge to swap roles which can't be done.\n\n\nIt may be difficult to have two players stay engaged through the entire game. The overall longevity of the game is obfuscated because an entire chapter may have such frustrating puzzles we had to stop at the end of each chapter and resume days later.\n\nThere is frustrating difficulty but it doesn't feel "bad", it feels like it was intended to be this way.","February 15, 2015","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The soundtrack is amazingly relaxing and calm, one that won't wear out your patience if you're struggling on one of the obstacles. If anything, it probably helps with keeping you from getting frustrated. On that note, obstacles require creative ways to get around them, and playing in co-op really brings this out. The only downside I can see to this game is that there is no in-game way to communicate via text; players would have to communicate either through voice chat (in-game) or a Steam chat. Otherwise, this game is a really nice and enjoyable experience all around. All in all, it reminds me of Portal minus the frustration.

I really love the art style 10/10\n-Great transitions between levels, they're really smooth.\n-Very challenging gameplay. Seriously the first few levels are "oh okay that's cool, I get it" but as you progress, the leves turn into more like "My patience is wearing thin. Help me figure this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•."\n-Voice chat (also a con)\n\nCons:\n-Wish there was a bit more instruction in the game. Yes the whole point is for you to figure it out; I'm not talking about that. I mean the level selection is a bit wishy-washy. Since there is very little text instruction it can be a bit difficult to figure you what level you are selecting\n-The voice that is..... okay. First I don't like the weird modulation/virtualization it does to your voice. It kinda makes it hard to understand and I know it is supposed to fit the theme of the game but it seems that if they left it unfiltered it would have been better. Also there seems to be a 3.5 second lag between when I say something and when the other person can hear it. This might be my ISP, but I'm not sure. Also, NO PUSH TO TALK! This sucks! If you enable voice chat, it's always on, and this sucks for me because I play in the living room where my whole obnoxious family is and I'm really self-conscious about my TV blaring on the other player's headphones.\n\nAll in all, It's a great way to challenge your brain and have some fun with your friends\n\n8/10 would recommend.","February 22, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After playing this with one of my friends, I have to say that this is an extremely fun platforming game, that is both relaxing and difficult.\n\nThings I loved about the game:\n- Visual Quality (it is so smooth and the particles effects are awesome).\n- Puzzles (The start of the game was quite easy, but once you played through, the puzzles took me a while to think of what to do).\n- Using momentum to beat puzzles (it's so satisfying).\n\nProblems I had with the game:\n- A little bit laggy when playing with a friend (that might just be my internet, although other games are fine when I play them).\n- Voice chat in game is a 2 second delay (but you will probably use Skype, Tamspeak etc. anyway).\n\nI would give this a solid 9/10.

This appears to be a simple puzzle game. The best way to play it is with 2 players which you can invite a friend or select the online option where you wait for someone else to join the game. You can play it by yourself using a keyboard and controller. I played using the controller and keyboard and had fun but it got annoying having to switch to the keyboard everytime I wanted the other to move. I wasn't able to find anyone online to play with so if you get this game and have a good friend, buy the Best Friends Forever Double Pack. It's only $2 more at the moment and both of you can get full copies of the game.\n\nThe graphics and audio in the game are simple but beautiful. You move through the level working together to get past areas that require some thought. How much you enjoy the game and how quickly you are able to get through the levels depends on how good you and your friends are at solving different puzzles.\n\nI got this game in a bundle but I would deffinitely buy this game after having played it for a bit. I think the price right now is a bit high at $12 (single) and $14 (double) but having those online features adds to the quality of fun you can have with the game. I would say if you can get the double pack at $10 or less, that would be the best value for the gameplay and features. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have.","January 22","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visuals are cute and colorful, the music is driving and fitting, and the level design never gets too complicated or sacrifices enjoyability.

Some have little to no co-op interaction, and the players might as well be playing alone. Some have "shared lives" where the less experienced player feels like they're dragging down the team. Ibb & Obb has the best co-op mechanics of the many, many cooperative games I've played.\n\nIbb & Obb is a puzzle platformer. Both players are needed to solve every puzzle, meaning a player is never left out or dragged behind. Sometimes the puzzles require that the players fill specific roles--Ibb. the green guy, is allowed through green portals and Obb, the red guy, is allowed through red portals. The developers cleverly alternate the use of these portals to ensure that no one player always takes the active role in each puzzle.\n\nMy sole criticism is that Ibb & Obb doesn't have in-game communcation to match the intricacy of its puzzles. Players can only draw colored lines in the air, but they are fairly short and fade quickly. This problem disappears if you're playing couch co-op or are using a mic.\n\nThe puzzles are excellent and make clever use of teamwork and physics.\n\nThe graphics and visuals are very pleasing.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing and certainly worth owning as well.\n\nIbb & Obb is among the best of the indie, co-op, puzzle-platform, and artsy genres. If you've got a co-op buddy, this game is definitely worth your time.","November 28, 2015","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Probably somewhere in the vijagame jouranlisms.  I really liked the visual aesthetic and the idea of a puzzle platformer built not just with co-op in mind, but built entirely around co-op as a necessary central mechanic.  I ended up playing the first level and a half solo just to get a feel for the game, and came away with the impression that it was going to be a cute, clever, but ultimately soft experience.\n\nThat was quite some time ago.  Recently got into it seriously with a friend, and damn, my initial impression was proven wrong.  This game is certainly cute but it is anything but soft.  ibb & obb will challenge your brain meat.  The semi-hidden bonus stages especially; they gave us several excellent opporutnities to flex our brain muscle and were always very satisfying to solve.  Considering all your character can do is move and jump, it's amazing the depth of puzzles they're able to create with concepts like maintaining or building momentum or manipulating which direction gravity pulls your character.\n\nThe only basic mechanic you have other than moving and jumping is a little colorful bubble trail thing you can create with either the mouse or the right stick, if you're using a controller.  It's the only communication tool you have in-game, and I was impressed with how much information we were able to convey to each other using this simple, visual medium.  Of course sometimes we had to open a chat window to talk deeper strategy, but still it's an elegant solution for the issue of communication between players that fits in with the game's minimalist approach to it's mechanics and aesthetic.\n\nI only have a couple negative points to share. The game starts out slow as you learn the mechanics and builds up the complexity on a pretty satisfying curve, but there are a couple challenges that boil down to basically challenges to your manual dexterity rather than your abilty to problem solve, and those are never as satsifying.  Secondly, we played online and towards the end experienced some pretty bad lag, which the game was not always good at mitigating.  We ended up with some weird lag artifacts like random enemies spawning in locations they shouldn't that only damaged one of the two players, or multiple copies of either ibb or obb respawning at once, or just really long wait times to respawn after death. Generally play was smooth and honestly you have to expect some problems when you play online over a crappy connection, but when the lag got particularly bad, the game had more trouble with it than I was expecting.\n\nIt's a relatively short game but there's so few games out there that are anything like it, and those few hours are densely packed.  ibb & obb is pure gameplay; there's no text or any exposition of any kind anywhere in the game.  If you dig platformers and puzzlers and various combinations thereof, and you've got a friend with similar interests, there are certainly less engaging ways you could split $14.  love that the "Best Friends Forevr" double-pack only costs two dollars more than one copy on its own.  If you buy the two-pack and split the cost with a friend, you're both basically getting the game 40% off.  That's how strongly the developer believes in their vision of a 2-player co-op puzzle platformer.","June 18, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are virtually no words throughout the game, and the game does a nice job of showing you how to do something before you do it (at least for the beginning puzzles).\n\n\nNeutral\n\nThe controls felt a bit off at first. The jump felt a little too floaty. But after about 10 minutes, it wasn't hard to adjust to it.\n\n\nCons\nWhile I said that the difficulty curve is fine overall, much of the latter part relies too heavily on being able to precisely time and coordinate movements between your partner with little room for error. If you or your partner mess up, you'll have to retry.\nMy main gripe however, which will probably sound pretty inconsequential, is the fact that the game doesn't exactly excel. The game does things well, but not really well enough to stand out. It makes nice use of it's gravity-changing doorways, so they don't feel tacked on, but unfortunately, there's not much else to set it apart, and with so many indie puzzle platformers, you really need to do so.","January 4","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a ton of fun for the first handful of levels but after the puzzles get progressively harder they introduce something so insane. They make everything pitch black and only the player can shed light. So like dude.. it makes some of these levels legitimately impossible if you're not willing to spend like 10 minutes per puzzle. But i recommend it because its fun and I cant really give it a negative review for being too hard.

I used to play it with my boyfriend in the same room. This is the game, which let us spend some time together not only in shooter games, but try something different. We learn how to understand each other, how to not get crazy and angry about each other. We played it as long, as it was possible to actually go through the level. At some point we finaly started avoid to play, cause we saw it's impossible to go through that level.\nAnyways, my memories is very nice about it, and I would start again to play after a year from the first level again. Game was a gift, so in that case I have nothing to regret. If you already have it - please enjoy, as much, as possible. If you think about buying it - thing again, if you're obssesed with finishing the whole game. Negative reviews is kind a right about how hard is to control two people moves at the precision accuracy.

Seriously, this is an excellent game, but it is a rough introduction to puzzle platforming once you get to the later levels--many of the puzzles require nearly flawless timing, and that's generally fine because you don't go back too far and the reset is fast, but those new to gaming will be sorely tested.  I have to give the devs a great deal of credit for tuning some of the puzzles to a razor's edge of perfection, and we found many sections where we knew what to do and came to the conclusion that it was impossible before seeking a walkthrough and discovering we had the right solution--we just weren't good enough and needed more practice.  I myself am OK with that (I love games like VVVVV), but my partner, who loved the game as it started, reached a point of "this just isn't fun now."  We have one more level, and I do hope we finish it.\n\nSo I love it, and do recommend it as an excellent coop puzzle platformer, but I would exert much caution using it as someone's first introduction to gaming.","February 15","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This appears to be a simple puzzle game. The best way to play it is with 2 players which you can invite a friend or select the online option where you wait for someone else to join the game. You can play it by yourself using a keyboard and controller. I played using the controller and keyboard and had fun but it got annoying having to switch to the keyboard everytime I wanted the other to move. I wasn't able to find anyone online to play with so if you get this game and have a good friend, buy the Best Friends Forever Double Pack. It's only $2 more at the moment and both of you can get full copies of the game.\n\nThe graphics and audio in the game are simple but beautiful. You move through the level working together to get past areas that require some thought. How much you enjoy the game and how quickly you are able to get through the levels depends on how good you and your friends are at solving different puzzles.\n\nI got this game in a bundle but I would deffinitely buy this game after having played it for a bit. I think the price right now is a bit high at $12 (single) and $14 (double) but having those online features adds to the quality of fun you can have with the game. I would say if you can get the double pack at $10 or less, that would be the best value for the gameplay and features. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have.","January 22","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This appears to be a simple puzzle game. The best way to play it is with 2 players which you can invite a friend or select the online option where you wait for someone else to join the game. You can play it by yourself using a keyboard and controller. I played using the controller and keyboard and had fun but it got annoying having to switch to the keyboard everytime I wanted the other to move. I wasn't able to find anyone online to play with so if you get this game and have a good friend, buy the Best Friends Forever Double Pack. It's only $2 more at the moment and both of you can get full copies of the game.\n\nThe graphics and audio in the game are simple but beautiful. You move through the level working together to get past areas that require some thought. How much you enjoy the game and how quickly you are able to get through the levels depends on how good you and your friends are at solving different puzzles.\n\nI got this game in a bundle but I would deffinitely buy this game after having played it for a bit. I think the price right now is a bit high at $12 (single) and $14 (double) but having those online features adds to the quality of fun you can have with the game. I would say if you can get the double pack at $10 or less, that would be the best value for the gameplay and features. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have.","January 22","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While you can play on your own, I don't recommend it as many puzzles rely on execution with percision movement.\n\nThe visuals of the game are stunning and every level has it's own unique feel to it. Complimenting the visuals beautifuly is the soundtrack which I do recommend you get with the game.\n\nThe puzzles are about a medium difficulty in the main game but can range from medium to hard in the secret levels. Once again, though, most of these puzzles rely on percision movement to complete.\n\nOverall, the game is very accomidating towards the 100% crowd and I can find myself spending many hours with my friend doing a full 100% of the game.

Sadly, I will probably never finish it as I know no one who is able to play this game adequately.\n\nIt isn't that this platform puzzle-adventure game is difficult. It isn't very difficult. It's just that all of my friends are into playing other types of games apparently. They play RTS (real time strategy) and other things. Oh well but that's the way it goes. It can be hard to find someone who is as good as you are at a game and ALSO wants to play it with you at the same time that you do. As this game depends on cooperation (most of this game's puzzles require a high-degree of cooperation) you need to play this with someone who is as competent at the game as you are and despite how cute this game looks, there are some fairly mind-bending puzzles in this game, but that's also a good part of this game's charm.\n\nThe music in this game is excellent. The sound is good and cute. The graphics are cute. The game runs really, really well. The controls are, if you are a platform gamer, intuitive. But you MUST find someone else who thinks the controls are intuitive as well. Your mother who only plays complex scrabble-type word games and who has never managed to win a super mario brothers game won't be good enough at this and so the game will be sort of frustrating. This really is one of those games, like the cooperative mode of portal 2, where you should ideally be playing with someone you know really well and who is at least as good at the game as you are.\n\n","February 6","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some have little to no co-op interaction, and the players might as well be playing alone. Some have "shared lives" where the less experienced player feels like they're dragging down the team. Ibb & Obb has the best co-op mechanics of the many, many cooperative games I've played.\n\nIbb & Obb is a puzzle platformer. Both players are needed to solve every puzzle, meaning a player is never left out or dragged behind. Sometimes the puzzles require that the players fill specific roles--Ibb. the green guy, is allowed through green portals and Obb, the red guy, is allowed through red portals. The developers cleverly alternate the use of these portals to ensure that no one player always takes the active role in each puzzle.\n\nMy sole criticism is that Ibb & Obb doesn't have in-game communcation to match the intricacy of its puzzles. Players can only draw colored lines in the air, but they are fairly short and fade quickly. This problem disappears if you're playing couch co-op or are using a mic.\n\nThe puzzles are excellent and make clever use of teamwork and physics.\n\nThe graphics and visuals are very pleasing.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing and certainly worth owning as well.\n\nIbb & Obb is among the best of the indie, co-op, puzzle-platform, and artsy genres. If you've got a co-op buddy, this game is definitely worth your time.","November 28, 2015","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Seriously, this is an excellent game, but it is a rough introduction to puzzle platforming once you get to the later levels--many of the puzzles require nearly flawless timing, and that's generally fine because you don't go back too far and the reset is fast, but those new to gaming will be sorely tested.  I have to give the devs a great deal of credit for tuning some of the puzzles to a razor's edge of perfection, and we found many sections where we knew what to do and came to the conclusion that it was impossible before seeking a walkthrough and discovering we had the right solution--we just weren't good enough and needed more practice.  I myself am OK with that (I love games like VVVVV), but my partner, who loved the game as it started, reached a point of "this just isn't fun now."  We have one more level, and I do hope we finish it.\n\nSo I love it, and do recommend it as an excellent coop puzzle platformer, but I would exert much caution using it as someone's first introduction to gaming.","February 15","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a ton of fun for the first handful of levels but after the puzzles get progressively harder they introduce something so insane. They make everything pitch black and only the player can shed light. So like dude.. it makes some of these levels legitimately impossible if you're not willing to spend like 10 minutes per puzzle. But i recommend it because its fun and I cant really give it a negative review for being too hard. Good job developers! such a sick concept until the darkness grips the heart of these two characters.","May 1","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So fun to, although frustrating at times. The beautiful art and music and atmosphere of the game help you remain calm. So so fun\n\nDownsides- online co-op can have lag issues, some puzzles are more exact timing and platformer based which is frustrating once you've figured it out but cant successfully make the exact jump\n\nBiggest downside- still haven't beatne that one ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• SECRET LEVEL WHERE YOU BOUNCE THE STUPID LITTLE ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and it's the only level I haven't beaten and its DRIVING ME CRAZY\n\n10/10.","May 16","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
