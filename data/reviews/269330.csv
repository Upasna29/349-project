The game is very imaginative, and the way you progress and use the mechanics make for a really fun experience. I also really like the voice acting, the design of the world is very pretty, and the music and sound is absolutely phenomenal. The game has a pretty good sense of humor, and I really enjoyed the exchanges between characters. The game's length isn't the longest you can find, but it feels right for the kind of game it is, and more than makes up for it with content. You will not regret picking this game up.\n\nOverall, I give this game 88/100, and would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games, or likes the use of time manipulation in a game.","May 8, 2014","true","2.5"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","32","35","0","0"

Enjoyable no matter what your age is.\n\nYou control 2 characters one with the power to rewind / fast forward time and the other a snail that can freeze it.

It was a good feeling to see the dead plant grow massively after just a little help!\n\nThe snail is useful as in you can hop on the snail's shell then switch control to the snail and go for a ride and jump off the shell to a higher platform, and it can slide along the games surfaces to reach area's the inventor cannot reach. The game has full controller support but is playable with keyboard but I always suggest playing platformers with a controller.\n\nI highly recommend the game, as it's one of those games that is obviously a labor of love made to bring enjoyment into peoples lives instead of the usual cash grabs that copy and paste what is popular for the day.","May 8, 2014","true","3.3"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","25","28","0","0"

Another platformer, another day, right? Same old, same old? With the copious amounts of platforming games available on Steam, what makes Chronology worth a purchase?\n\nChronology, thankfully, gives you a lot of reasons.\n\nAs described in the trailer, you play as an older gentleman and his friend, a snail. The present time in the game is set after an apocalyptic event, and using a special device he invented, the old man can travel back and forth through time at will. The snail (who has some sort of robotic shell) can stop time. Together they use these abilities to progress further, to tackle challenges, and to save the world from destruction.\n\nThe very first thing you see here is the art of the game; no lame, overused, big pixel graphics here. The world is beautifully exhibited in the past time and hauntingly dark in the present time. The overall look can be described as having been painted on a canvas; Osao Games, developer of Chronology, seems to be inspired by Studio Ghibli in terms of artistry here, and it shows: attention to detail, such as curtains blowing in the wind as you pass them add a definite touch. The transitions going from past to present give a stark contrast: former architecture in the past has broken down in the future, vegetation takes over parts of a city; it's little things like these that add so much to the visuals.\n\nThe music here fits in well and is very, very awesome, ranging from happy, to urgent, to bleak, to pensive, and it seems that every scene you are in is complemented perfectly by a fitting musical score; whoever made the music to this, you get my props for that one, man. The audio for the rest of the world is vibrant and gets the job done. Voice acting in this is great, which surprised me. I didn't expect this level of quality in the audio!\n\nThe gameplay here is simple. You can utilize a gamepad or the computer keyboard's arrow keys + spacebar. Controls here are tight, and work really well and are very simple. The platforming aspect of the game is transformed through the use of the time machine in your possession; landscapes change from the past to the present. This leads to very cool and unique platforming (for example, jumping whilst in the present, using the time machine, then landing on a ledge in the past). Other puzzles include planting a tree in the past in order to climb up it in the present. The potential uses of time here are great, and it adds much needed fun to the dry platformer genre.\n\nThe developers made an excellent choice by telling you the controls, and then they let you play. That's it. You are in control, and you learn how to tackle the game's puzzles on your own. Once you meet your snail friend, they'll give you a small clue on where to use her time-stopping powers, but other than that, it's all on you, and I love it for that. It's rewarding when you figure out a puzzle through your own assumption; that being said, more experienced people will sort of breeze through some puzzles, but even I got stuck at a cleverly designed puzzle at times.\n\nThe only negatives I could see to this game include minor audio bugs, which most likely will be sorted out, and some players may find it a bit easy to get through as it is relatively short, and the final climax at the end is slightly underwhelming. However, this game is solid at almost every level.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend Chronology for anyone, at any age. It's an awesome game that rekindled my love of platforming games in a time where I didn't seem to like them anymore. It's unique, fun, simple, and just generally great. It's worth $9.99, definitely, if this kind of game interests you, although I wouldn't shy away from a discounted price.\n\nIf I had to give this game a numeric rating, it'd be a 9/10.","May 8, 2014","true","2.9"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neongrey33/recommended/269330/","neongrey33","neongrey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neongrey33/","398 products in account","Chronology is a game that very nearly didn't exist at all, and wouldn't that be a shame. The game was Greenlit on Steam last year only for the original development company, Progressive Media, to fold beneath it. Fortunately, former team members wanted to see the game come out, and formed Osao Games to complete work.\n\nA lot of times it can be worrisome when a game changes hands like this, but the final product is a thoroughly charming experience that should be a staple of everyone's Steam library.\n\nThe gameplay centres around a two-character mechanic: a little old inventor, and his trusty companion, the snail. Neither character is given a name beyond that, but neither do they really need them. The inventor is able to travel back and forth between two time periods: 'Before' and 'After' the cataclysm which starts the game. The snail is able to stop time, but her hard shell also serves as a positionable platform for the inventor to stand upon. While in some cases, that merely gives an option to ease up a tricky platforming section, in other cases it's critical to solving puzzles.\n\nThis means, to address the elephant in the room, that Chronology really doesn't play like Braid at all. The intended effect, per the developers, is something like a cross between Day of the Tentacle and Lost Vikings. It's not a bad comparison, really-- you'll find yourself constantly adjusting the environment in one time to affect the other (taking boxes from After into Before, growing plants in Before to solve puzzles in After, and so on), and you'll need to use both Inventor and Snail's abilities to their fullest to figure out some of the harder tricks.\n\nWhat's most impressive here is just how thoroughly the game hybridizes puzzle and platforming. You're never making a series of annoying jumps just to get to the next puzzle-- the question of how to set up those jumps <i>is</i> the puzzle. Chronology never pulls a new gimmick out of nowhere only to drop it after a single puzzle: it teaches you how to solve the doozies by teaching the components singly and then expecting you to put the pieces together.\n\nAnd believe me, there are some <i>hard</i> puzzles in there. They make logical sense when you figure them out-- more than once, I found myself saying aloud, "Oh, that's clever!" -- but there were a few where I must have spent ten or fifteen minutes trying different things before the obvious-in-retrospect solution came to mind.\n\nIt's not a fast-paced game: you can always take a leisurely look at the puzzles to see what you have to do, and there are only a couple where twitch movement is even at all necessary. Good timing is often important (learn to switch times mid-jump) but the game is overall pretty forgiving. You have unlimited lives and you always respawn at a convenient spot when you inevitably fall to your death (or fall into toxic waste, or die to a sawblade, or drown...). The closest thing to a fly in the ointment in that respect is the fact that the game only saves at chapter breaks. Chapters are short enough that I can't complain, but I don't recommend quitting out mid-level after just finishing a tricky puzzle.\n\nThe game is fully voice-acted, which was a pleasant surprise. Of particular note is Nicki Rapp voicing the snail: recently she's been in Broken Age as Dead Eye Courtney, and Walking Dead as Lilly (and let's never forget Psychonauts, of course). The inventor is played by Brett Dunnelly, who gives him a pleasantly crotchety character. The background music is thoroughly pleasant, providing an excellent enhancement to the game, easily manipulating tension. It's well worth picking up right on its own.\n\nThe graphics-- well, they hardly need mention, but that's not because of anything bad to them! The cartoony art is downright gorgeous both still and in motion, and the attention to detail is wonderful. I'll gladly hand in a few points of gamer cred to admit that when I saw that when the snail backs up, the little red lights on her shell flash, I squealed like a little girl. Osao definitely went the whole nine yards here, even in places where they could have cut corners. Before and After are never identical-- After's ruined world skews broken supports, twists platforms, grows every tree. The game is outright beautiful.\n\nThe story is, for its part, a bit unremarkable. I don't honestly mind that-- it goes well with the cartoonish art style, and it's quite well-told. I can't call it light-hearted, given that it starts with an apocalypse, but it's consistently upbeat. The story respects itself well enough to be played straight-- it's never smug or condescending. No, instead it's a perfectly servicable children's story, and there's a lot of charm to it.\n\nThe game itself is a bit on the short side, but it knows to get out while the going's good. While I think another level or two wouldn't have hurt the game, it never wears out its welcome.\n\n(Review also available at http://www.gamesxtreme.com/article/4102/chronology-review/ , transcribed here with permission)","May 12, 2014","true","4.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

I can see how this game would be appealing to a younger audience or those new to the genre.\n\nExcept for the length. This is a very short game and I was able to beat it in less than 2 hours.\n\nThis game feels heavily underdevelopped. The time travel and time stopping mechanics are interesting, but very little is actually done with them. There are only two time periods that you can jump between (not too bad, but I've seen better) and very rarely did the actual passing of time between them come to play. More often than not, you might as well have been jumping between parallel universes or something along those lines.\n\nThe time stopping is also rarely utilized and with a handful of exeptions, usually to make stationary things that could have been stationary to begin with. Altough, looking back, I think I also missed a few opportunities to use this ability to make the timed platforming easier. Overall, I found that I mostly forgot about this ability and when it came to the puzzles, it was one of the last things I tried applying, unless the need was obvious.\n\nOverall, the concepts in this game had potential. But I don't feel like they were fully realized. I was missing more inteplay between different mechanics and elements in the game. More use of the time travel aspect of this game about time travel. More mixing different mechanics in with the platforming.","July 13, 2014","false","1.6"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Who wouldn't be a bit crotchety about that? Overall I found the story fun, the puzzles were well done and I only looked to a guide to figure out one of them.

Otherwise, read on...\n\nThe game is a platforming puzzle game that mimics the artwork and feel of Teslagrad, Vessel, and Limbo, but with the mechanics of something like Braid. You are an old man who wakes up in a strange place and need to figure out where you are. He discovers his lost timepiece and with it, the ability to control time. You use the device to travel between past and future, altering the world in ways that allow you to overcome puzzles and advance to new areas. You can interact with certain objects in the environment, carry them with you between worlds, and use them in the past to influence the future, etc.\nThis is inherently the difficulty in the game: figuring out how to manipulate the past to affect the future, etc.\n\nAbout a third of the way in, you meet a snail companion, who also has an uncanny ability; he can stop time. Together, you must use your powers to help the other succeed.\n\nThe puzzles are clever and challenging, but nothing that will keep you too stumped. The platforming is ok, and sometimes it's a bit frustrating, but it's nothing that's too unforgiving or would make you want to put it down.\n\nThe music is pretty good and fits well with the game ambience.\n\nIf you don't mind a short game that's more pleasing with the visuals and music, then this one is worth a go.

An expertly crafted platformer, the game boasts a beautiful art style to complement its sharp gameplay. The story is simple, but effective. An unnamed, elderly inventor is determined to find his shady mentor after one of the pair's contraptions causes apocalyptic destruction. Along the way, the inventor encounters a friendly snail with the ability to freeze time. Combined with the old man's penchant for traveling from past to present, the slimy companion introduces a unique gameplay structure.\nThe player alternates between the two characters in order to solve brilliantly designed puzzles oriented around manipulating time in order to alter the landscape and circumvent obstacles. The snail's shell serves as a movable platform that can be used to cross gaps, sawblades can be halted in mid-air, and impassible walls in the past become ruined structures in the present. Switching time periods in the middle of a jump can turn certain doom into a saving ledge or platform. These basic mechanis build and combine in interesting and challenging ways as the levles progress. One particularly creative head scratcher involves multiple time switches, an anvil, and flaming cannonballs, all to simply open a door.\nThe game's visual design is superb. Colorful character models and environments seem to pop off the screen. The bright wimsy of "before" transforms into the dark, dilapidated melancholy of "after." The contrast underscores the narrative's focus on regret and the consequences of terrible decisions. Puzzle construction also reinforces this relationship. In one of the game's shining moments, a decision made concerning a young child in the past has subtly profound implications in the present.\nWhile the time spent in "Chronology's" world is welcome, it does not last forever. The entire experience can be completed in around 2.5-3 hours, leaving the player with a distinct-- and regrettably brief--brush with greatness. Osao Games should be commended for this effort, a game that merges artistic integrity and ambition with incredibly enjoyable platforming mechanics. Warning: "Chronolology" also contains blatant disregard for the laws of the space-time continuum.\nScore: 9/10\n\n","May 14, 2014","true","4.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The world is made more interesting by its wonderful art style and lovely music, making progression through it's short 2-3 hours a joy for eyes and ears.

Mediocre plot. I accidently trapped myself twice by jumping into an area that I assume was supposed to be inaccesible.\n\nMostly puzzle based platforming until the last level and then it switches to skill based. The game feels like a long tutorial especially since it took only about 2 hours to finish.\n\nMain reason I wrote this review is to point out how horrible the protaganist is. He is mean to the snail constantly even though the snail saves his life multiple times. Also, to progress at one point I was forced to cripple a child for life in order to steal his cane as an adult in order to grab a hook that was out of reach. The old guy I steal it from even has his entire life perspective changed as a result. Before breaking the kid's leg, his adult self was grateful for the home and his life. After, he blamed the house for a miserable life. I actually tried to find an alternate solution because I felt so terrible.\n\nTLDR: Pretty, short, and I didnt understand the moral of the story.","March 8","false","1.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/war_drake/recommended/269330/","war_drake","War Drake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/war_drake/","158 products in account","Chronology was a fun experience, but a little lacking.  It's definitely worth a playthrough, and I would recommend it, but I'll try to keep my thoughts concise enough to be helpful.\n\nPros:\n-Interesting gameplay concept.  I had a lot of fun just conceptually with the idea of not only switching between two versions of the levels, but more importantly controlling the two characters in tandem.  It was a lot of fun, and the game's strongest point.\n-The game, while in a level, feels extremely responsive and well crafted.  Switching between the Old Inventor and the Snail is very fast, as is changing the time period.  Moving around and platforming feels good, rewarding and all around pleasant.  While there are a few quirks here and there, they're to be expected, and overall I think the dev team did a wonderful job making sure the play experience during levels was enjoyable.\n-Every one of the game's backgrounds is a delight to look at.  The art is cartoony, and fits the feel of the game extremely well.  The music, as well, made my playthrough immersive and pleasant.  I'd very much recommend dropping the $3 on the OST.\n\nCons:\n-Length:  The game, to be honest, felt really just too short.  The length of the levels would be fine, but the difficulty was a far cry from... well, difficult.  Admittedly subjective, but as someone who isn't that great at puzzle games, I breezed through this one almost without stopping.  I was stumped for a very brief moment on one or two parts, but otherwise it was more about the experience of playing the game, rather than solving any puzzles.\n-Out-of-gameplay experience:  While the actual platforming and game mechanics felt amazing, the rest of the game left much to be desired.  With no ability to skip cutscenes, replaying the game feels needlessly cumbersome.  The inability to set custom controls was harshly felt, as by default my controller defauled to using the top face button for jump.  I had to go into my controller's settings and re-map the buttons to match up with hte game's control scheme, and that was not appreciated.  There was also no option to change the resolution of the game, only toggle between fullscreen and windowed  It is possible to resize the window, but it would still be appreciated, having defaults in the menu that resize it to maintain window ratio for recording or just comfort purposes\n\nFinal Thoughts/Summary:  Chronology is a fun, interesting title, albeit on the easy and short side, with a cute story and a lot to offer aesthetically.  Mandatory cutscenes and no custom control mapping curbed my appetite for replaying the game, but I would still recommend it for a single playthrough.  At a $10 pricetag, ($8 early sale at the time) however, and most of my on record gameplay time coming from leaving the game running while afk, I wouldn't recommend picking it up unless it greatly interests you.  If a future update were to fix the issues, however, I would love replaying the stages and finding little quirks in the gameplay.","May 15, 2014","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It it super short, only about 2 hours. The art and music are nice. I honestly couldn't tell you what the story was about, as it was pretty bare-bones, not captivating, and didn't make much sense. The voices of the characters are not fitting, especially the snail, which sounds like an 5 year old boy for some reason. There are multiple bugs. Items you have to use get stuck on your snail and you cannot pick them back up, making progressing impossible. This problem is furthered by the fact that there are no save points, if you quit the level you have to do the entire thing over. Luckily levels arent that long. Another big is sometimes things that should be interactable aren't, leaving you to spend some time switching time and hoping that it fixes itself. The other biggest problem is with puzzles. While many are cool and intuitive and make nice use of mechanics, some make no sense. Most of the time it's because you didn't know that object that looked to be part of the background was interactable. In one instance you're supposed to know that a light in the background can be jumped next to and that causes it to be knocked down, even though that's never happened before in the game, and there are other similar looking lights in the room but one is just usable for no reason. Usually when I looked up solutions I thought "well how was I supposed to know I could use that, or that it would do that to that object, that has never happened earlier in the game and that's not reall reasonable", or "that looks like the background". Also the platforming isn't that great, as your guy moves super slowly and jumping feels like he has lead weights tied around both ankles. Most of the jumps you have to make take multiple tries and you may just BARELY make one time even though you were standing on the very end of the ledge, and you just barely landed only half way on the other ledge. All in all its a cute fun little game. Wish the puzzles made more sense or were more obvious that what you had to do was even an option. 6.5/10.","February 26, 2015","true","2.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Anyway, I believe they could have made better puzzles.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's not a bad game and it's even entertainig, but for a similar price there are way better and more interesting puzzle platformers out there such as Teslagrad, The Swapper, Braid, Limbo or Blocks That Matter.","May 21, 2014","false","3.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Time manipulation is introduced as the driving mechanic but then barely used in any interesting way, or completely forgotten for more tired adventure and platforming standards. There's this setup to an involving time travel narrative that's rather quickly exchanged for the dull relationship building between your character and a talking snail that does little but demonstrate that you're kind of a jerk.\n\nAll of Chronology's best ideas are left on the wayside for an experience that feels painfully typical. Puzzles are bland and extremely simple in construction, only ever becoming difficult do to the finicky interaction icon that makes it hard to discern what exactly you need to interact with, or the backgrounds which while beautiful tend to be hard to make out from objects in the foreground. Progression always felt tedious, puzzles slowing me down but providing no satisfaction to solve beyond the knowledge I'd never have to sluggishly make my way through them again.\n\nThere was a point when Chronology seemed promising, but it flounders around with its direction so long as to never feel cohesive or engaging. Its mechanics are disorganized, poorly implemented and rudimentary, and its narrative may as well not exist for as little substance as it has. The artwork is wonderful, but animations are choppy and the lack of vsync made for omnipresent screen tearing. It feels like a game formed in a puzzle platformer mold, with a handful of modifications having been made to differentiate it from the pack that probably did more harm than good in the long run.","December 15, 2014","false","1.6"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","1"

Despite getting stuck for 20 minutes I finished the game in just a little over an hour.\n\nThe controls are fine, although they could be improved. In some of the puzzles you have to switch between the characters and use their special time manipulating abilites, it would be nice if you could control the snail and the inventor at the same time or at least use 2 different buttons for their abilites.\n\nThe story is told as you solve the puzzles and is really straightforward, the game seems suitable for children.\n\nOverall it was a short but nice little experience.","January 16, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
