"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/206760/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Painkiller: Recurring Evil is the last "stand-alone expansion pack"/"fan sequel" for Painkiller. It feels like it's a sequel to Painkiller Redemption for sure, feeling like it was made by fans. And it was also released in 2012,  8 years after original Painkiller, not being ashamed of milking it today with that old engine. At least this is the last one. There is no multiplayer, just single player horde gameplay of 5 levels.\n\nTechnically, it didn't bug or crash on me so much, but there were still some loading times being long and performance issues here and there. Widescreen is still supported, yes.\n\nStory continues Resurrection plotline, wehre Bill killed one angel and got a sword. Which was stolen by Samael angel immeditly and so Bill is going to kill him. And well, there is only text. And after that there is only sucky ending. Well, two of them. You either have done nothing or got killed. It's all decided with your usual "choose your ending" on final levels, just like most games when "multiple ending" was fancy. You just choose two samey "good" or "evil" path. Yes, seriously.\n\nAnyway, at least game itself is better than Redemption. Mostly because instead of reusing DM maps, makes of Redemption actually created five of their own. They are kinda generic, I am sure they reuse same models from previous titles, but they look nice. Like, foggy graveyard. Even if graveyard is generic by now. But hey, at least that Aztec temple is pretty cool.\nAnd fights themselves got better. Because instead of having to kill 1000 monsters, you have to kill 600 on average. Hm, that description on store page about "6000 in total" isn't true, don't worry. It's still on really dragged side.\n\nAnd yes, it's still horde-based, there is still times when you will just have to bunnyhop around and shoot rocket. But at least it uses better variety of monsters. And levels themselves aren't always open-space, it's more often a hallway. Second level was quite interesting at that, a highway littered with cars. They not only make space more complex, but can be blown up, damaging enemies nearby.\nNot to say that it's any less dumb though. It still spawns at you more enemies than usually expected in Painkiller. And it still drags every room on. And bosses have so much HP that you may mistake them for puzzle bosses. And are lame.\n\nAt least carot cards are easier to get. Well, easier to get at least some. As much as you want to bother.\n\nAnd well, the point is, it's not as terrible as previous two offers, but it's still in "it sucks" category. Like, bringing absolutely no weapons or monsters. Actually, seeing how you play Bill, you still only get Painkiller weapons, no new one from Ressurection. The only difference would be messed up weapons slots. Why even. And well, you will be bored while playing this. It's still a cash-in.\n\nAt least it's a good thing that it was the last cash-in. After that a remake of original Painkiller came out, with story reboot. Which is still better than the "expansion packs" Painkiller franchise was getting. Maybe we will see some sane sequel soon, who knows.\n\nAnyway. It's not the worst but It's dragged. It brings nothing new in gameplay. It doesn't shine by itself. It still keeps that horde gameplay that has too many enemies to fit into Painkiller mechanics. There is still fun to be found though, by itself, to be honest. Like from simple mod for Painkiller. But it just feels like a waste of time. People who played original don't have to bother, people new to Painkiller should play original game.","July 7, 2015","false","5.4"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sparticusjoe/recommended/206760/","Sparticusjoe","Orsonposter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sparticusjoe/","315 products in account","It *is* better than Redemption and especially Ressurrection, but considering those are two of the most ♥♥♥♥ poor attempts at making a videogame I've ever played that's like saying that Desert Gunner is better than Air Control. It's functional, yes, but that doesn't really make it good.\n\nIt's got the same "kill a million dudes, another six feet of the level opens, then kill a million more dudes" that the last two had, but the main difference here is that that "zillion" is down from the "trillion" that Redemption had. Redemption was unplayable because you simply did not have the space, health, or ammo to kill all the enemies in each level. This one you actually do, and i was able to play through in insomnia difficulty without ragequitting like in Redemption, where going through without cheating was virtually impossible due to bad game design.\n\nWhich is this game's problem, the design. It's not BAD, like in Redemption. It's not completely broken like in Redemption where it's unplayable. But it's not quirky like Overdose and it's not excellent like Black and BooH or H&D, it's just kinda... there.\n\nThere isn't much to recommend here. It's functional. It's about six hours of painkilling entertainment. But it's not really any good entertainment. No new weapons, enemies. There are five levels: A church (seriously, enough with the dang churches. Every painkiller's had a church level and it's just never that interesting), a highway (the sole interesting map), a graveyard (again, yes, for the fifth game in a row), a warehouse (yes, again, another damn warehouse), and a mayan temple that's actually kinda cool, and one other level so generic I forgot about it already.\n\nSo all in all, if you're like me and on a holy quest to play every painkiller game ever made, get it because it is in fact a painkiller game.\n\nIf you just want to spend ten bucks on a good game, well... it isn't. It's not bad, but it sure isn't good.","August 12, 2014","false","8.7"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

Med-Art decide it is their turn to drive another dagger into the inert, lifeless heart of the violated beast. "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it"; an esoteric and unfamiliar phrase that echoes around in their bewildered head, but the meaning behind is lost, and the voices fade as they plunge the icy, adamantine blade into the core of the bloodstained creature. All mistakes repeated, nothing learnt, it's only saving grace is a swifter duration of torture, a total accident and in no way a deliberate intention to improve the experience.\n\nAll the evils of the series are indeed recurring and at this point, unsurprising, commonplace and expected.\n\n3/10","April 27","false","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The text scenes are already tiring since Redemption and the levels are too short.
