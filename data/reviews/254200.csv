Before I proceed, I have a suggestion; Do the following:\n\nStep 1.) On the Store page for this game, where it tells you whether the reviews are Positive, Mixed, or Negative, click on that (It says mixed for me right now, but there's no telling what it says for you).\n\nStep 2.) You should see a Heading that says "Helpful customer reviews".  Observe the filter.  I suggest you click on "Negative".\n\nStep 3.) Read a few of the negative reviews.  I read about 6 of them and noticed a trend.  See if you notice something as well.\n\nStep 4.)  Now, keeping everything you've read in mind, go back to the main store page and scroll down until you find the link on the right that says "View Update History".  Compare the content of all those negative comments with what you see now on the update history.\n\nNow we may proceed.\n\nDid you notice a pattern?  A trend?  My observation was that it appears that the bulk of the negative comments on this game consist of individuals who do not comprehend the meaning of "Early Access".  I say this because, before writing this, I did those above steps.  I read what they had to say, and compared it to what the game is now, as of this writing.\n\nI found all of their arguments invalid, because they failed to understand that what they were playing was a work in progress.  Their complaints are/were all worded in such a way as if they were reviewing a finished product.\n\nAll too often, we see detractors whine and complain saying that "Early Access" is an "excuse" for their poor quality.  I suggest that people who make this argument are either trolling, or lack the intelligence to comprehend what it is they are saying.\n\nThe entire purpose of Early Access is to allow the community to support and be involved in the direction and development of the game.  If you expect a game to simply spring forth, fully developed with all features intact and no bugs to speak of, then you aren't looking for an early access game at all, but an ordinary full release product like any other of an endless list of games elsewhere.  You cannot influence a game that is already finished.\n\nThis game was very rudimentry when it was first made available to the public.  Some basic block placement and a creative mode.  That was IT.  Early reviews claimed it was a "Minecraft Knock-off" and "Boring".  This is why I asked you to read through all the negative reviews.  Because if those people were to say those things about the game now,  any reasonable person would wonder if those people were even playing the same game.  Remember this when someone says that saying "Early Access is a cheap excuse".  Because those people obviously lack the reasoning to understand how this system works.\n\nThere are few games on Steam that I have seen with the level of developer interaction and update frequency observed on this game.  Look at the discussion threads.  You will find that the developers actually engage in conversation with, and consider the input of the players.   That interaction is the POINT of early access.  We as players get to influence how the end-product turns out.  You can't do that with a finished game (barring MODs of course).\n\nI have no way of knowing what your experience with survival sandbox games consist of, but if you're reading this review, there's a strong chance that you are not new to it.  If you are new to it, then you are fortunate to arrive on the scene when you have.  The genre has evolved quickly, and it is continuing to do so.\n\nThis game is still early access as I write this, and that's why I wanted you to follow the steps above before reading what I have to say.  I hope that ultimately, if you do decide to purchase this game regardless of it's state of development, that you will be pleased with the outcome.\n\nI myself enjoy this game.  I have watched as new features are added, changed and removed, tweaked, or radically altered.  Ultimately, only you can decide if you like it or not.  But I hope that you'll be able to make a more informed decision whether you want to invest in it's development.  Or if it's done by the time you've read this, only you can decide\nif it's worth your money.\n\nMy humble opinion is that it is/will be.\n\nHere's why (took me long enough didn't it?) :\nFortressCraft Evolved takes the basic block-based voxel genre and adds automation, tech trees to research, and ever increasing risks and rewards for exploration.  Furthermore (depending on the difficulty setting) you'll find complacency to be ill advised.  There are threats looming on the horizon and you can lose.\n\nSome of the more rewarding technologies require exloration into hard to reach areas, requiring you to upgrade your survival suit in order to acquire them.  Some of these areas require an investment in infrastructure and defenses.  Whether you are playing single or multiplayer, you'll find the whole thing challenging and rewarding.\n\nAgain, this is just my experience having played the game from very early development until Early Access 1.20.\n\nI have no regrets.","September 20, 2015","true","147.9"," 264 of 327 people (81%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","81","264","327","16","14"

Take the technic mod from Minecraft and make it 100 times better.\n\nThis is one of those games that are pretty simple to figure out, but as you progress it gets a bit more complicated.  Mainly this game is all about logistics.  Getting resources transported from your mine to your base so you can smelt it and make new items and do research.  All while defending your base from aliens that attack you if your base threat gets over 100%.  If you like a game about logistics you will love this game.  At first it starts off very slow and you manually do everything, but as you progress you start to automate.  It is when you get to the point where you start automating everything where it can either be a whole ton of fun or a logistics nightmare.  You have to make sure you have enough ore coming in to feed your smelters.  So you are always looking for new veins of ore to tap and send up to your base to be smelted.  Plus having to figure out how to get power down to your mine and also keeping a nice design of your base.\n\nOne thing to remember is you can just about move anything except for the CPH and the research station.  So don't be afraid if you build your base one way and want to change it later.  I have done so many redesigns to my bases because I didn't play far enough ahead and had to tear most of it down and rebuild it.\n\nI am not going to do a Pro's and Con's list.  Because it is still in early access and things change almost on a daily basis.  Also remember that this game is early access and things do change.\n\nOverall it is a very enjoyable game and I have put in tons of hours into it and I am looking forward to new things as they get added so I can implement them into my base design.\n\nI do recommend you run the Bleeding Edge beta if you are planning to play it because it has all the newest stuff in it.\n\nAlso the Dev is really awesome and have talked with him several times and he loves input about the game.  I stream this game and he has watched my stream several times and has even helped me out a few times because I didn't have things setup properly and he walked me through it.  He talks with others in chat in the stream and answers questions people have.  This is the first time I have actually seen a dev actually watch a stream of their own game and ask for feed back from those watching and from the person streaming.\n\nMy overall opinion of this game is grab it.  It is ton of fun and you can also play with friends (just gotta open up a port on your router).  One of the few games out there that is truely Co-op.","January 10","true","395.7"," 100 of 110 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","100","110","2","0"

It was rough, a lot of things didn't function properly and I was confused as hell. Went to the forums and almost 1:1 the dev was posting back and talking, on all the forums I checked. Big ups for that.\nWhat about the game? Well its minecraft style construction and world building but that's where the comparison ends. You extract ores to creat ingots to create new machines to support your lazy butt because the name of this game is automation. There's been more than once where I just sat back and let my machines work to produce some ingots i needed or research modules. This game has some serious depth to it and with all my hours I have in the game, they're all in ONE SAVE. Last game I played that let me do that was Dark Souls. So Yeah this game deserves your attention. It doesn't look the best but the gameplay is fulfilling and there's tons to work towards. SOme crack head said one of the end game items was a 20 hour work, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t 50 hours in and i ain't got it. I just finished the last of the tech tree so now I get to build the fancy ♥♥♥♥ i researched. So pick this up because its worth your money and if you're having issues ask the dev because i've had full conversations with the guy. He's really cool and helpful. He takes your complaints and suggestions into considerations.\nThey fixed more bugs than i can count when I started this game.

This game SUCKS my time. I can't stop playing it. Every time there is a couple of new updates (at least once a week) I start a new world to see the new stuff. I have yet to finish it. Something new will come along and some of the stuff on the old world just isn't as good, so start again. Every time I get a little bit faster and a little bit further along but I just like to try to build all the items and see how they work. I only wish that you could download all of the different versions to really see how far this game has come. The developers are on the forms constantly updating. The only problems I have ever had with the game is trying to run an old version after a major patch and then some items mess up. So what, start again and see all the new stuff. My favorite part is that I don't have to finish the game to play it. It's not linear. Do what you want.

Pls.forgive spelling :)\n\nWhen I first got the game I saw great potential in this game, I mean.. SPACE, Building, Tower defence, and combat... how could I go wrong. Well I will till you this, my first opinion was a negative review, the game was a resource hog, there wasn't much to do, was able to beat the game to my satisfaction in just one sitting on the weekend (-8 hours). But hey, it was EA and as such I do not give bad reviews to EA games that are still being worked on, because you never know right? However if I had, I would have given the game a 3/10.\n\nOver the year I have been part of the "Bleeding Edge" bate patch group. AKA the, "this game is now broken" patch where new stuff was tested. there were several hickups when patches were relised, however all you had to do was report the issue and 9/10 the problem was fixed with a new patch in just a few hours. NICE JOB DEV'S. main patches we constent 1-3 days apart, except when RL issues delayed the Dev. However being a one person team sometimes this happens. It was not uncommon to even have several main patches a day if the DEV was on a roll. So is the Dev dedicated to this game??? I would have to say he is more dedicated then 99.9% of the Devs out there. Just for that point alone the game then became a 6/10.\n\nWhat's my opinion now that the game is out of EA???  Well I have to be honest, the game isn't done to my hopes and dreams that the potential first showed. but I need not worry because the Dev still plans on putting in just as many hours a week now as he has in the past so MUCH more stuff to come. the game is still a bit of a resource hog on top settings, just when you take in consideration when I fist started the game I was on the lowest settings and getting lag, I can now play abouve recomended with little no no lag... 1000% improvment Many items, and tings to do have been added taking an 8 hour game well past 150 hours (depending on your play style) the dificulty with the added features have made a game that I use to play on hard settings into a game I need to play on below normal (still learning the new stuff).\n\nI have been typing to long now so I will give you my "out of EA" rating. I would love to give this game a 9/10 but due to some bugs and glitches still active I can only give it an 8/10. losing one point for the glitches (all games have them even "finished" games) and losing one just because you can always improve the game right? BTW 8/10 is the highest rating I have ever given a game... so that alone is a "WAY TO GO DEV"","November 9, 2015","true","508.1"," 94 of 112 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","94","112","6","0"

That's where the similarities end really.\n\nMy daughter plays Minecraft, she plays it for hours. However, whenever I sit down to have a go, I get bored after about 20 minutes. You dig. You build. You dig. zzzz\n\nFortressCraft is much more immediate than that. Your power is running out, you're going to freeze to death, so you need to organise. This forces you to think stategically, about power, about distance, about supply lines (and presumably, in the future, defending them from other players). It kind-of feels more like a RTS, but with blocks.\n\nIf you're used to other Mine games, this one IS even more complicated. But part of that is due to a very alpha GUI, things aren't as obvious as they could or should be. This will be fixed!\n\nfor example, bringing up your inventory, you have a bunch of blocks. What are they? no idea, a mouse-over tooltip would be nice :)\n\nAlso, I'd rather you only had things in  your toolbar that you actually owned, it's too confusing with *every possible thing* being shown, yet you can't use 90% of it. Again, early access, these things are to be expected.\n\nOne thing that is immediately "wrong" with the game - shelter. If you build a "house" over your base equipment, put a torchfire or two in there, surely it should be warm enough inside that you don't freeze? What's the point of building a "Fortress" if it doesn't have any benefits lol :)\n\nI absolutely recommend this, if you're a fan of Voxel miners or even RTS games. I see a bright future for this game, because unlike others, there is actually a game to be played, a point to it all. (you can, of course, go into creative mode and just build pretty stuff, but I kind-of don't see the point of that unless you can then turn the world into a survival one for you and your friends. No doubt that's coming too eventually).\n\nBuy it, try it. If you don't get on with it, try it again the next update. and the next. It's going to be a good one :)","April 30, 2014","true","81.5"," 99 of 131 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","99","131","0","9"

Since then it has degenerated into the mess that it has become today, an unfinished hodgepodge of ideas found in other games with no clear direction, no character and no fun. The mob graphics are shoddy and the loot system is incredibly weak. Players consistantly complain that they find progression to be awkward and the game has no real aim or endgame amongst other flaws in basic game design which prevent them from working through the messy research system but the one-man-band developer refuses to accept their concerns, maintaining that his design is flawless, and original of course, so they walk away having wasted their hard earned cash on a bad clone. This game should never have left early access at it stands and shouldn't really even be on Steam.\n\nI asked one of the devs why there were no building blocks available in the survival part of the game and they told me... and I quote from Skype...  "I can't be bothered to write the recipes"  I later find that they're selling the survival game blocks into the game one by one to Patreon supporters as though they're a commodity.  I've never heard of anything so stupid.  A voxel block game with no voxel blocks until Patreons 'buy' them for the playerbase?  What a joke.\n\nIf you're considering purchasing this game you should know that even though the base game is unfinished, the developer is now concentrating on a paid expansion pack which he intends to sell for $8 (subject to Valve approval). If you buy this game now you will not be able to use the resources you see ingame unless you pay an extra 8 bucks for the expansion. No, he didn't tell the rest of us that either and while comparable indie games like Space Engineers and Factorio are a huge success with 1,700 players ingame consistantly without this kind of failed-game pay-to-play mentality, these guys are either too lazy, inept or don't have the brains to see past their own short-term pockets and even though this game has been on Steam for years, are attracting less than 500 concurrent players ingame and trying to make up for the shortfall in popularity/profit with useless paid DLC. I'm all for buying good DLC for a good game but the game has to be finished and popular first.  God knows how much I've paid for Payday DLC but those guys deliver content.\n\nI'll move on to content after the next round of developer downvotes.\n\nThe biggest problem with this game is it's developer's attitude. A very rude guy who doesn't listen to players, is struggling to earn a living from the game because of that and is now begging for money in his stickies on the forum with threats that he will stop development and go & find a job if the game continues to fail.\n\nThe developers were also begging players for positive reviews a few months ago because the game had a red 'mixed' review tag, now each time a negative review is made he sends over his 50 cent army to falsely manipulate the Steam rating system and argue with the reviewer, incredibly obvious because the same names appear in the comments section of each negative review and they are mostly using fake, private profile, Steam level zero accounts. The same fake steam accounts are also being used to pump up the positive reviews for the game. Steam really should do something about it because they are cheating customers. People from the publishing house with financial interests in the game no doubt and it certainly doesn't help that a steam moderator is involved with this game's development, also fairly despicable that the same Steam moderator is fully aware of and allows this kind of manipulation of the Steam review system, time for Steam to remove him I think.\n\nNow for those who don't know, the developer's previous job was working in a limited role on Borderlands 2 which obviously didn't include game design. Most if not all of the 50 cent army downvoting this and and all other negative reviews for the game have only Fortresscraft, Borderlands 2 and a couple of other free games in their limited Steam level 0-5 game list. What conclusions can you draw from this? The developer's friends from his previous job who've been gifted copies of Fortresscraft are defending him? Or the developers friends have been gifted both Fortresscraft and Borderlands 2? Either way it sounds like they're cheating Steam and their customers to me.  2K Games employees too, that should be interesting.\n\nWhile the game developers and other financially or emotionally interested parties keep sending the 50 cent army here to downvote my review, abusing the Steam rating system I'll remove their abusive remarks and downvotes by posting it again, they just keep reminding me of more flaws in the game to add to the review & that way it will stay on the recent review list forever until they learn to accept genuine reviews with genuine ratings from genuine customers and stop manipulating the Steam rating system and cheating Steam customers.","May 12","false","801.0"," 121 of 177 people (68%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","68","121","177","13","6"

I've not yet seen everything from the new stuff, but I moved some outdated issues further down into an archive section and updated the text in general.\n\nThis game is voted more negative has it should be. It's quite interesting and plays like a big Minecraft mod but without the normal Minecraft features. It has many flaws, some easy ones like lack of help at the beginning and some bigger issues.\nThings that could be better:\n- needs cables. Using batteries as a replacement for cables for small distances is expensive at the beginning and also quite inefficient. The laser energy transmitter are bad for diagonal stuff. There should be cables for medium distances.\n- big lack of reasons to do stuff. You are only playing to produce more ressources to build more machines to produce more ressources... (minecraft and other games are having the same issues though)\n-- there should be more survival in there. There's only energy and temperature, build a solar station and you are fine forever. Needs food and the need to hunt creatures and build farmes. Creature breeding would be nice too, they could give ressources needed to craft stuff.\n-- there could be more interesting stuff deep down. Like stronger creatures who need better weapons. Like Minecrafts nether or ender world. The "goal" of the game could be to get super deep to the strongest creatures and best materials, build the best equipment and fortify a base in the hostile environment.\n- the weather. It's snowing all the time and snow everythere, that's depressing. Needs some sun and grass.\n- there's no reason to be on the surface. You are either deep down sitting in your hole, basement dweller style or at the ever snowing and depressing surface. Watching your machines doing monotone stuff makes the world feel even colder.\n\nUpdate due to good point from from WolfWrag:\nThe development seems really slow considering it's not much cheaper than Minecraft. I thought it was free or cheaper, maybe I got it cheaper due to a sale. It seems to be a side or hobby project of like one developer. I don't know how many people bought this game so it may be a bad ratio of invested time vs earned money. Though even the full price of 9€ is relativly cheap compared to normal/typical games (thought even Minecraft costs ~20€ I think). I played a lot so my ratio of playing & had fun time vs. price (even the 9€) is still quite good, especially compared to those triple A games for 70€ where you are finished and bored after like 20 or 30 hours (or even after a few minutes). So I would still recommend it for people who like Minecraft and want something different with a different focus.\nComparing it to Minecraft is also a bit harsh as Minecraft was a much bigger success, has a higher price, has/had more developers and was developed over several years until it was like today, as most people know it. I joined Minecraft in Alpha or Beta stage and that was much more buggy, unfinished and had less features as FortressCraft has now. FortressCraft could add more stuff like survival with farming, animals and maybe something like the logic stuff with Redstone in Minecraft and it would be quite comparable to Minecraft feature wise (both would have stuff that the other hasn't but the amount would be comparable).\n\nArchive with outdated issues:\n-- there are some creatures in there like those rock morph things but nothing that does anything or is useful. Some creatures should be hostile. It's interestingly scary to go deep but there's not really a reason besides sound and graphic effects.","May 4, 2015","true","126.0"," 41 of 48 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","41","48","0","7"

This is an actual review with actual details about the game and such. you may not want to read this. I know most people like to read / write reviews that only gives 1-2 vague sentences about the game.\n\nI’ve been playing FortressCraft for 4 years now. I originally bought FortressCraft on the Xbox when it first came out back in April of 2011. I have played the Xbox hundreds of hours and have been there through all of its development. I can sit here all day and tell you all about the Xbox version too, but this isn’t about that version, this is about the evolved FortressCraft, FortressCraft Evolved.\n\nFortressCraft Evolved isn’t a port or a remake of the original FortressCraft, it’s a reimagining. The game has been completely rewritten from the ground up using Unity as the game engine (They were using XNA framework on the Xbox).\n\nThis review is of version 1.15d. I’ve owned FortressCraft Evolved on Steam since the beta for the pre-alpha (You had to know someone to be able to play it, wasn’t available for purchase on Steam yet; It was hidden).\n\nStory:\nThere isn’t one currently, unless you count the 2 paragraphs of text in the help menu.\n\nMain Menu:\nCurrently, the main options in the main menu are the 'join multiplayer server" option and the world select option. You can create and select at least 10 worlds currently. You may be able to make even more than that, but I have never had need for more than 4 worlds at a time because the creative worlds are so large, I can just go find another place and start building.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are great. There are shadows and mist, and dynamic colored lighting. The textures are HD and the models are very good.\n\nYou can change the resolution of the game, whether it is full screen or not, and the quality of the graphics.\n\nControls:\nI read a lot of reviews that say the controls are horrible and this and that and I don’t know about them, but I don’t have any troubles at all. You move with wasd and any command you need to press ‘on-the-fly’ are all within reach of your left hand. Keys that aren’t are things such as: The Help Menu (h), Toggling the headlight (L) (which requires power and glow sticks are better (g key)), Inventory (i), and that is it.\n\nAs for creative, you will have to use the F9-F12 keys to use the special build commands, such as super build and copy / paste.\n\nAny complaints about the buttons being in a bad place are really rather dumb though as you can customize any button. When you first launch the game, a configurator appears and you can scroll through every ‘control’ and change the key and also change / set a secondary key. Don’t like the “Toss a glow stick” key being G? Change it.\n\nYou can also change the sensibility of the mouse in both the X and Y position and you can invert it.\n\nPlayability:\nThe game does have a few bugs and mishaps, but as far as playable, it is very. I can get on survival mode and play for 5 hours straight and have almost no issues. Almost all bugs are found pretty quickly and are reported to the developers who are actually pretty active. For an Early Access game, I would say it is high on playability. Is it perfect? No, but it's...EA...\n\nAnnoyances:\nYou can not change worlds without exiting the game. This will be changed before it leaves EA though.\n\nYou can not change the graphics and controls in-game, only in the startup menu. This does not include sensitivity.\n\nCreative mode:\nThis first mode is creative mode. This mode has transformed a lot over the years and I think the best thing about creative mode are the custom blocks.\n\nCustom blocks allow you to create...custom blocks. You create what is called a ‘workshop’, which is a hollow cube that is 2x2, 3x3, 4x4,..., and 8x8. You can place blocks inside the workshop, like normal, but once you leave, anything inside of the workshop will be compressed to a single block and you can then go and place it and use it. Check out the 13th picture in the Steam picture roll for the store page to kinda see more about what I’m talking about (The train).\n\nThe other special feature about creative (and is in survival) is called build-to-me. You hold down control and click on a block out in the distance, and it will build the block all the way to you along the axis. This feature is amazing and I wish more games had it.\n\nThe other two nice features about creative are super build and copy and paste. Super build is kinda like WorldEdit (the Minecraft plugin) but way better. You can see what the build will create in real time and you get a simple GUI to customize the super build you are about to make instead of typing a bunch of complex commands. You can build a sphere (you can edit the radius), a rectangle (you can edit the width, height, and length), and a cylinder (you can edit the radius and height). You can change the size from 1 to 64 and you can make it hollow or solid. You can also make it build with the selected block, or you can change it to dig, so it will essentially add air as the block.\n\nCopy and paste also works sorta the same as WorldEdit. You select one corner, then you select the other corner. You then get like a preview type of a thing and can see exactly what you just copied and what you are about to paste looks like. You can rotate your paste and see it rotate in real time. You can simply press the paste key and it pastes. You can paste the same object as much as you like, it doesn’t go away after the first time. You can also save what you have copied and the developers have said that they will one day add a workshop where you can upload the copied items to.\n\nAs for blocks, there are over 200 different blocks you can currently choose from.\n\nA REALLY nice feature they added recently is called the paint gun. Some of the blocks are ‘paintable’. You can change to the paint gun and change the colors of the R/G/B. There are 16 of each color, so you can make a wide range of colors. You point and shoot and the colors of the blocks will change (but keep the texture). The feature is topped off with the fact that you can point at the block and middle click, and the block will be selected as your current block and keep the color that the block is painted.\n\nThe last significant feature is the Storm Staff. With it, you can use the scroll wheel to select different features and: change the time of day, make it sunny / thunderstorm, and spawn a meteor that starts in the sky and crashes and explodes wherever you point the staff. The latter is super cool to use and spamming it creates an awesome lag fest of awesome and explosions.\n\nAs a final note, the world goes 1,000 light years in all directions. This is different in Minecraft because Minecraft only goes about 1 million in length / width and about 128/256 in height. Another note is that while the world is still 1,000 light years down in survival mode, once you get at about 5,000 depth, the world gets super hot and you will die from hyperthermia.\n\nSurvival:\nSurvival mode is totally unique and really awesome. It has machines, kind of like Tekkit, but not really. When you start, you start off with a way to generate power, a crafting table, a smelter, and an ore extractor. Instead of health, you actually have power. If you fall, you lose power and depending on your conditions, you lose power more quickly.\n\n===================\n\nAs it turns out, my review is too long.

Unlike the others, though, ODP offers significantly more in the way of RPG elements.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, ODP is very much in the real-time roguelike tradition, with a series of rooms in which the player faces challenges of combat or dexterity. You are locked in a room until you complete it, and then may enter an adjoining one.\n\nPros\nCompared to other roguelikes, ODP has level progression per session, with choices of perks at each level-up. Your choices are effectively a build for the session, and reduce the randomness normally associated with roguelikes.\n\nThe gothic art style is a good choice, and was no doubt influenced by Edward Gorey, a personal favorite of mine, as well as more recent expressions of the genre, such as "Don't Starve."\n\nODP has a story that unfolds in fragments, and while it's hardly a masterpiece, it's far more than one would expect for the genre.\n\nCons\nThe lack of controller support is a big mark against the game, and an oversight that is more egregious considering the genre.\n\nI like the sketchy, gothic art style, but ODP's art style feels amateur and inconsistent. Some objects feature sharp, fine lines and hard edges, while others are soft and look like they've been heavily resampled. Also, there is insufficient variation in room props. I've seen many pixel-perfect-identical desks or chairs spawn in neat grids in the room.\n\nThe pacing is poorly managed, and the rooms quickly become boring and repetitive. Many rooms require far more patience than actual skill, at times making the game a tedious slog.\n\nPickups are mostly uninteresting and give small bonuses to stats like health, critical chance, and damage. Roguelikes usually feature a variety of highly powerful objects or abilities, or at a minimum, very interesting ones with multiplicative synergy. ODP's pickups lack synergy and (generally ) only linearly affect stats.\n\nThe game's difficulty is disappointing. The game is very easy when compared to hardcore roguelikes, and will probably disappoint players who expect a serious challenge.","November 12, 2015","false","79.8"," 222 of 350 people (63%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","63","222","350","12","36"

The devs are very responsive to the community and often respond within a day or less.\n\nEdit - as of release\nStill awesome, still a lot to do, a lot of improvements have been made to give you a more "isolated" feeling like you really crashed landed.  The difficult of this game can go between easy and holy crap stop it hard so I think thats a good range for both new and old players to voxel type games.  I can literally lose a weekend to playing this.  As to the rumors that it's buggy, unfinished, or abandonware.  The dev believes in complete transparency, he announced a feature lock on what would be in the release, and even slipped in some extra goodies in his spare time.  There are plans to add even more features beyond the hundred or so game hours you can easily sink in to the existing ones.  As for the bugs, this has far less than pretty much any AAA title on its release day (lets not even bring up every bethesda game ever), most of the so called bugs are not bugs, they are misunderstood features or someone feeling butthurt for being stupid, those that are real bugs, usually get patched within a day or two and eventually cycle up from the bleeding edge version to the mainline.","August 2, 2015","true","210.4"," 41 of 52 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","41","52","2","1"

The developer has now declared that it is finished, and all he'll be doing now is fixing bugs. Here are the remaining issues I have with this game:\n\n1. Consistent UI for machines. This one tripped me up repeatedly. I'd go to a hopper and press E to interact with it, because E opens the UI for pretty much everything else in the game, but the hoppers have no UI. Honestly it makes more sense to use T to Toggle the hopper settings, instead of Throwing selected item on toolbelt into it. Would be Consistent to have a UI for the hoppers, see exactly whats in it, then you could pull specific things from it.\n\n1a. When I finally started tossing iron in, I would have to press Q repeatedly to get everything out of the smelter feed hopper. Then drop the iron in, and if I dropped in anything else, it would randomly select what to make next. So I'd have 1 iron bar, and then a bunch of copper and tin. Although, it's indicative of not random, but a LIFO type system. Last In First Out. Since copper and tin were already automated to that hopper.... So in order to get JUST iron out, I'd have to rotate a belt, empty the hopper, put the iron ore in, wait for the iron ore to finish processing, then rotate the belt back, and drop stuff in again.\n\n2. Mobs pathing through solid objects. Got a nice recording of a slime inside my CPH and also inside the crafting machine. Can't shoot it there.\n\n2a. Kinda got lucky on my base placement, although at the same token, unlucky. It's been a while since I've started a world and had my base nestled at the foot of a mountain on one side. Because the last time that happened, I had to DIG OUT a mountain side, because the green balls of wasp vomit? poop? were flying out of the mountain side at my CPH. Once I dug out enough, I found 2 wasps just chilling inside the mountain, shooting at my CPH. Like solid walls? who cares! we don't have the programming to respect solids. With the slime just willy nilly oozing into and out of my CPH, I'm going to have to assume that nothing else respects solid surfaces either. Arther sure as hell doesnt.\n\n3. No display showing how much charge arther has. At least he's no longer holding a digital sandwich board, cracking jokes, but it's impossible to figure out how much charge he has now, except with a charging station I'm told. It's nice that his text now shows up over your toolbelt, but the sound is a bit obnoxious. Reminds me of an old NES game, where when the characters talk, it would make little blip noises with each character... like Zelda.\n\n4. Arther upgrades still reside in your inventory, and same with suit upgrades I'm assuming, since pressing S in the inventory screen opens a screen for suit upgrades that looks clearly incomplete. I made Arther's power core, why the heck does it live in my inventory? Why doesn't it go to it's own area? IIRC, you can take arther's power core out of your inventory and put it into a storage box. As long as you pick it up before you log out, and it's in your inventory when you launch the game, Arther counts it as having it.\n\n5. Still wish there was a compass. The holobase does seem much better somehow, and there's these red arrows in it, no idea what those are about.\n\n6. Logistics Hoppers, the white ones, although they still didn't spit things out as fast as a Large storage hopper, you could use them to empty a mining drill and send the contents onto a belt. Now they are slower some how. The point of the logistics hopper was to get the ore out of the drill and into transport. Now there's no choice but to stick a storage hopper on them. Which also seem slower in their dispersing speed.\n\n7. New Issue. The automation machines, the stamper, the extruder, the coiler, and PCB maker, used to just zip right along. Since they updated the recipe for laboratory pods, to use 1 PCB per three plates, for a total of 2 PCB to 6 plates for each lab pod... I would build a belt turntable, put a hopper on top of it, stick conveyers on each of the outputs, 3 sides leading to a stamper, 1 leading to the extruder, coiler, PCB maker, have the belts meet at the bottom and move up into a second hopper at the same level as the first one, so you could waste less resources and make lab packs... The whole build occupies slightly more space than the New and improved Behemoth of a CPH. But seeing as the speed of those automation machines is excruciatingly slow now, it causes a backlog, throwing the ratio's off. That's when I decided I'd had enough FCE for a while.\n\nThe early game of FCE is Excruciatingly slow. Now with the improvements to the speed of the automation machines, it's going to be EVEN SLOWER...\n\nWhat FCE feels like to me: Solitary Confinement.\nWhen I shut the game down, I don't feel like I'm leaving FCE, I feel like I'm escaping.\n\nI'm really happy I got two copies at such a cheap price, but to be honest, unless it goes F2P, I'd leave this alone and spend your allowance on a game that was made by a developer that cares more about giving you a quality game, rather than how much money they get for making it.\n\nI will delete comments on this review at my discretion. I'm tired of being harassed by FortressCraft Promoters for expressing my opinion. I'd like to lock it so no further comments can be made. But apparently I don't get that option. So if you love FortressCraft Evolved, write your own review and stay off of mine.","November 3, 2015","false","179.1"," 182 of 290 people (63%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","63","182","290","16","7"

The world looks like Minecraft, but feels more realistic, and your task is to gather ressources and build up a working factory (not like a big plant, but several small pieces put together to smelt, craft, shape, improve, research many things you find on the planet) so that you can finally be rescued or something (don't know, I didn't came so far yet). But (same as Minecraft, Factorio and similar) you are not alone on this planet. The more you proceed down the earth (or however this planet is called) the more you attract some kind of insectiods, which will visit your factory from time to time and check if you need anything (like terror and death). They seemed driven by a higher intelligence, and yes there is something like that. Either somewhere burried in earth are some huge globbing eyes hidden behind a undiggable wall of ... don't know what, looks like the stuff from the Alien-Movie. Those "Eyes" send small creatues to steal ressources from unprotected conveyors to reach with their ugly arms after your factory. The other ones are vastly huge, four-headed, brain-thingy, glowing ... things. Well, you will recognize once you see them. And, I don't know wether I was day-dreaming... but I think I saw something like that worm from Star Wars that was hidden inside that asteroid trying to eat the Falcon...\n\nConclusion:\nQuit your Job, break up with girl-/boyfriend, close windows and doors, headphones on, uhm... maybe VR if you have  and buy the game.

I absolutly adore this game and has tons of wonderfull ideas and features with literally constant updates. So lets get into the game. What is it? You could say its minecraft but in all honestly...it kind of isnt. It is its own unique game with tons of unique blocks and features that I would love to have in minecraft, that not even modded minecraft can offer. So lets get the good and the bad in the game listed in a nice little list. This is a little lengthy so if you dont want to read all of this and want to know the short version\n\nSHORT Version: Its a good game lots of features and updates, little bugs, if there are it gets fixed pretty quickly, dev streams and listens to his watchers. Also they look at feedback and love to get feedback on the game.\n\nLONG: If you want more depth here you go.\n\nPROS:\n-It is constantly updated on a daily baises. There are new features almost weekly and when they did a poll on their twitter, literallythe next day there was a solution and was implemented within a pretty short amount of time. A day or two before it was in the game.\n\n-Bugs are quickly addressed when reported and usually will have a patch in a decent amount of time, depending on how game breaking it is of course.\n\n-Multiple tiers that you work your way through as you go deeper into the world.\n-Researching those tiers. The deeper you get the more Research points you get (RP) The more blocks and flora you scan the more you unlock.\n\n-Replayability. Theres a lot of replayability in this game and with constant updates and a lot of features being planned it is always a new experience. (Especially if they add the planned features like space)\n\n-ARTHER. An amazing little robot that you can dress in a top hat, eye monocle and an good looking moustache. Love it! Though hes really useful ingame with status updates and back up power if you run low.\n\n-Much more to list that would just make this ungodly long.\n\n-Multiple game modes that are pretty fun ranging from hardcore and rush mode one or two others that I cant think of atm.\n\nCONS\n\n-Not everything is implemented yet. Some stuff is in there but it hasnt been properly fleshed out. (Though this isnt in early access, it still technically is because of a lot of reasons that you need to game developers point of view to understand. (Which the dev actually explained to us in a stream in depth which gives you a big understanding of the gaming industry. Like the top games make 90% of the money. Even though fortress craft is in the top 500 for steam games they still struggle, so even though this is the con section, I highly suggest if you buy the game you buy the DLC with it to help support them))\n\n-Things can be a little difficult to piece together, even with the handbook, so it may take a little bit of time to figure things out or do a little research (Again its being fleshed out and the handbook is still unfinished so its understable)\n\n-Your kind of stuck in spot defending the same area. Now Im sure they have plans to change that especially when they plan to implement space, so for right now your kind of defending your castle.\n\n\n\nHonestly Im just prying cons out of anything I can just to make this seem fair, but there really arent to many cons. If you cant launch the game then talk to the dev. They'll try to help you. Trust me, they want to help you and expand their player base. You can listen into one of their streams and their ideas and viewpoints are really nice to listen into and really put time into their game. It is a bit of a tedious game so it takes time to make things but once you get the hang of it you will surely have fun. This is truly a fantastic game and you should give it a chance. I would honestly even say that this game should be valued way more then 10-15$ for the amount of work they put in, so its a pretty good deal for a game like this.","November 26, 2015","true","149.9"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","31","38","0","0"

You can eeven rotate the whole thing before you paste it.... amazing\n\n"lighting"\nconfigurable lighting at that!!!! configure the colour strength and distance and even shadow type, individually for every single light you place.\n\nI could go on and on but then if you are liking whats mentioned above then you are most likely going to enjoy the game and enjoy exploring everything else out once you start playing it and creating anything you can think up.\n\nI hope this review is of help to you.

However, FC:E stands out from the crowd due to the rather powerful tools that are available to the player. The various tools that you are able to use allow you to make very large and very intricate creations. Copy/Pasting sections of the world can be done very quickly and the ability to create your own blocks using the ingame workshop function allow a level of creativity that has not really been seen in such voxel games previously. I myself have not spent a huge amount of time in creative, however from the limited hours I have put in it became clear rather quick that those who enjoy the freedom of making anything they want will really benefit from these tools and this level of freedom.\n\nSurvival\nHere's the mode that has stolen a huge amount of my time. In basic terms the survival aspect draws many of the gameplay aspects of those in Minecraft - mining, resource management etc. but here's where FC:E does it differently. A huge focus of FC:E's survival mode is based upon automation and logistics, creating large transport, mining and power networks to build a base and gather resources.\n\nThe blocks that exist in the game all have useful functions and although can be a bit daunting at first, are quite easy to use and options for creativity open up once you get the hang of things. If you've played anything like the Feed the Beast modpacks for Minecraft or Factorio then this is the game for you.\n\nCurrent state of the game\nAs far as I am aware the engine for this game was built by the developers themselves, allowing them to tailor it to suit the needs of a game like this. It's definately not perfectly optimised, but I have certainly seen worse and the development team are constantly working to improve on this as well as fix bugs, this is to be expected in an Early Access game.\n\nThere's a decent amount of content in the game to allow you to spend quite a few hours building and creating what you want. The development cycle is quite fluid and the creators are quite active on the forums, responding to questions, asking for feedback, addressing issues etc.\n\nMobs and combat are the next big thing to come, which will add quite a bit in terms of gameplay as you will need to defend your base and resources.\n\nMultiplayer in Creative is complete and as far as I'm aware pretty free of bugs. Survival Multiplayer is currently in a working condition although there are some bugs still to be ironed out, but as mentioned previously the devs are quite open and transparent about this and work on this is constant.\n\nOverall I believe this game is a steal at it's current price. Judging from what is already in the game and what has been discussed as the future of FC:E on the forums I really think this game sets itself apart from all the Minecraft clones on the market.","May 12, 2015","true","187.3"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","24","31","0","0"

Nothing has changed. I saw the devs update less and less. Then Nothing. Then almost Months later come back screaming "where not dead!!!!." with no updates since then or anythign else done.\n\nIts my assumption this game is dead.\n\nSure, some fun things to do in creative, but i bougth this for survival. And so its unplayable. So many bugs and glitches. You dig a hole and the wall disapears or you fall forever. Dig a deep hole to mine. No simple later to climb your way back up. Just that grappling hook which is ridicously stupid since you will grab a wall and will just fall instead of holding onto the ledge to regrapple to the next higher area.\n\nNo enemies even though they sit there. You can't find any specific ore, or be able to access the ones you need.The robots or other tech to help you gather the resources don't work and create a really big irritant.\n\nI spent majority of my time running between sites trying to repower them so they could work a little more.\n\nThen you die by freezing to death. Go underground Freeze. Search for deposits, Freeze. Lose your energy, Freeze. No way to locate your base? Freeze. Repower yourself and end up burning yourself Alive.\n\nSpeaking of which, No compass or way to find your base again! Yes the map is small (which is another issue), but you can't find your base, because everyhting looks the same.\n\nThe map is small and you can't find any materials you need. I kept digging and digging, not a single material i needed (Lithium) *cough* *cough* could be found.\n\nI thougth this game would feature defend you minning base or somthing cause aliens will attack. Nope....\n\nAnd oh yes the UI.... Looks like a kid in HS made it. I mean its bad. Majoirty of the items in your inventory don't have images. Half the items don't work. and when would I make more than one item at a time? unless I'm in creative mode where I'm just messing around.\n\nAt that point its boring to me. Sure maybe for you artsy ppl this is great. but for me its a waste of time and I find no entertainment out of it.\n\nOverall, A great concept.

I played it since early stages and seen it evolve and I can say that devs are really working hard to make this game aversome. There are of course bugs, but they not game breaking, and you can easly ignore them.\n\nWhat i feel playing only survival mode that it's Minecraft on steroids. You get building gun that has VERY long range, infinite world with no bottom and TONS of things to craft. And its not simply digging a few blocks and just making them into some items. You need to use machines to mine ore and coal, power it up and get ore to smelter to get bars for stuff to make. You need to research new machines and tools, and some research proyect requie several machines setup and TONS of power and metal to get.\n\nBut the best thing about this game is building automation. You can set up a mine, connect to storage, to engine, load with coal and just come back for ore later. Or you can connect conveyor belts and your ore is transported to smelter, power mine from some sorts of power that is supplied by coal from other mines and your mine will work by itself until it runs out of ore. You can sort your materials, set up complicated structures and watch how its nicely work by itself.\n\nThe only think that it's lacking is info how things work. You get short toturial, but basically you need to figure out how each machine works, and there are few dozens of different machines.\n\nThis game is great. Maybe not perfect, but it's something I've been looking to play for a long time.","October 6, 2015","true","760.9"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

Two of the biggest advantages of FortressCraft (gonna call it fc from now on) are the superbuild tool and the copy/paste tool.  I find both of these EXTREMELY useful.  I can cut the time in half by just holding down ctrl + m1/m2, whereas in a game like Minecraft (I'm probably going to compare/contrast fc to Minecraft a lot in this review) it takes much time, patience, and effort to build things on a large scale.  Also, the way that the terrain spawns is pretty cool.  It moves in to take position instead of just appearing like in Minecraft.  Next, the list of blocks to choose from, in my opinion, is WAY bigger than that of Minecraft.  Configurable Lights, Ore Extractors, heck, even a huge laser gun!  Now before I start getting a lot of nasty comments on this review let me make one thing clear:  I do NOT hate Minecraft.  I actually like it. In some cases, I prefer it over fc, but remember:  this is the pros section. Okay, where was I?  Oh yes, the large library of blocks to choose from.  Ok, so moving on.  I also particularly like the lighting of the certain blocks that produce it.  I also like that the blocks to choose from are mostly sci-fi themed, whereas Minecraft has more of a 'survival' themed list.  Alright, I think that covers the pros!  Now to the cons.  Fc is probably one of the buggiest games that I've ever played.  Now, hold you horses!  This is an EARLY ACCESS game.  You would be a fool to think that an early access game wouldn't be buggy.  I'm sure that all of the glitches/bugs will be gone in time.  Also, after you fly around for a while and you land, your sight radius dramatically shrinks.  Sometimes, I can only see about 10 blocks in front of me, and that's it until I restart.  Again, early access game.  It will get fixed in due time as with the efficiency of the servers.  One last thing:  I know that it's being built/programmed as I type this review, but as of this moment, fc is ENTIRELY single player.  PLEASE don't leave comments about how it's being made right now.  I'm just saying that if you're planning to buy it right now then be prepared to play ALONE.  Obviously, the pros outmatch the cons by a landslide, so I give this game a 2 thumbs up!  I can't wait to see how this game adapts and evolves!!!","January 4, 2014","true","10.2"," 63 of 103 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","63","103","0","5"

But now you get so much info in game, you really don't need a wiki or forum for a long time.\nYou get a super cool elevator, so you don't have to walk all the way up and down.\nEverything is simple to use but but you have to think about it how to use it best.\n\nThe game is just pure fun.\n\nI was always looking for a Tekkit-Lite (MineCraft mod with technology) alternative. This might just be it.\n\nI love it, that the destroying of blocks is so easy, that the building is so easy, that you have no "realistic" ground where you always fight to get it nice looking. Here you work with cubes in MineCraft size, the difference is, everything is fast and looks good and there is so much to do.\n\nWhat I saw and what makes me wanne play a lot more but I  don't have the resources for it yet:\n- Defense turrets\n- Spiders\n- Threat scanner\n- Power storage\n- [...] (I have researched not much yet)\n\nAnd this is just the beginning.

By far not.\n\nIf you are bored with your current open world building, mining, crafting game, give this one a try.\nIt is not yet very good, but already good enough to be fun for minecraft fans.","April 25, 2014","true","37.4"," 26 of 37 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","26","37","0","3"

I am a veteran of Minecraft, FTB, MITE and various other custom maps and challenges particularly in survival mode. FCE is similar, but different, to all of these and is centered around your base. You get most of the tools you need from the beginning, and from there it is up to you to build your base around the ore you find, and to automate it. Automation is really cool - you can do things the hard way, yourself, or build a conveyer belt and laser power and it does it all for you! You can just stand there and watch it go, and I often do! After a while you will have to deal with mobs too, so base defences come into play. There is a tech-tree for you to discover which unlocks a lot more of the game, and the "limits" are not what you are used to - there is no bedrock, you can just keep going and going. Super-dig and build-to-me features are "wow" as is the x-ray vision mode, grappling hook and jetpack.\n\nYou might think that after all those hours I have done everything there is to do in this game. Well, I have played out a few worlds but no, I still have plenty of things I want to try.\n\nEven though there is Witcher III and Fallout 4 (coming), I'm already calling this my "game of the year". Stick with it and you will find it great fun. Sure, it is still in "early access" but this is already better than a lot of fully released games. What are you waiting for? get it now!\n\nps.

Also unlike minecraft, it has more of a longterm goal list then "Punch tree, make bed, find diamond, now what?"\nAs you decend into the planet you also face progressivly tougher chalanges, from both the alians and the enviroment itself.  it forces you to think out every action.\n\nOverall, it could use a little bit more work, but what would you expect from somthing labled "Work in progress" Can't wait to see the next update.","November 11, 2015","true","86.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

We can see that on their Youtube channel, FC videos are 2 years old or more. After this long time FortressCraft is still in early access with lack of most interesting features. I'm wondering why this game development is so slow when the original FortressCraft was sold and earned milions $... Or maybe they lied about FortressCraft success?\n\n- Game is still in early pre-alpha version where we have ONE world that looks similar every time we want to create it again, why to the ♥♥♥♥ there's always snowy biome?! Every new game starts in the same way, the same world, the same origin.\n\n- Lack of block, there are maybe 40 blocks in whole game\n\n- The original FortressCraft was one of the best-selling Indie games of all time. Maybe it was... but this one will be dead soon, only 300 reviews in one year. 100 of them are negative. People are not intrested in making ripoff of ripoff again.\n\n- Unique survival mode based on... well... nothing, because there's nothing hard to do. You as player, you are not forced to defend yourself using weapons, walls, shields, cannons or something. Game isn't challenging. The main difference between survival and creative is simple - there's no flying mode and you have to craft stuff.

This game definitely looks amazing and has equally amazing mechanics in how each machine interacts with the others.\n\nThe learning curve for the mechanics can be a bit steep but once you get the hang of it you'll spend hours building and changing things and still have more things to do! Defintely many many hours of fun to be had.\n\nFor single player I'd give it 9/10 and for multiplayer I'd give it 8/10.","November 12, 2015","true","125.0"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

I have played for many hours(although a lot of that time was spent afk... I tend to forget I have games running) The basic concept of the game is great, gather resources, build massive assembly lines, defend against attacks, all to save yourself when you crashed on a freezing planet.  So then why the negative review?\n\nThe game appears to be a released title but upon deeper investigation (after I had bought the game, stupid me) I realized that it was still in Alpha/Beta but the developer wanted to make more money so he "released" it on steam.  The game has missing icons/textures, wonky AI, and is still has a MASSIVE list of features to be added, bugs to fix, and balance issues to address.  I havn't encountered the game breaking crashes/bugs others have reported.  IF I WANTED TO PLAY EARLY ACCESS I WOULD BE HAPPY.  The game is being updated and features are being added.  The negative review stems from the fact that it is not a complete game even though it appears that way at first.\n\nOh, also the dev has stated that he is breaking the game into several expansion packs.  So you only get part of the content for your initial purchase.  However he only recently decided this(or made it clear).  I can understand wanting to get paid but it is sneaky and dishonest to publish an unfinished game and then charge people more money if they want the finished product.  If all this were clear on the store page I wouldn't be writing this review(and would probably be fine with it... although i would have waited until the game was complete before considering purchase).  The sneaky way it is handled is what bothers me.\n\nSo FOR NOW I do not reccomend purchasing this game.

Frustrating at first, but already the developers have made it much better.\n\nI've never played Minecraft but have always wanted to, but when I went to their website and would have had to sign up for an account before I could even see how much the stupid game cost, I became annoyed. I read on another site it was $30 (which I'm not sure is true or not, regardless I became more annoyed). Lo and behold, that same day on the front page of Steam I see FortressCraft for $4. Needless to say I got it.\n\nThe first hour was an incredibly frustrating experience because I had absolutely no idea what I was doing and the help menu wasn't helpful at all. Thankfully they have made it much more in-depth, so new users shouldn't have nearly as much trouble as I did. I read a guide and got into it, having quite a bit more fun even though finding ore was tough at first (they have also made this easier, using one key and scrolling to find the ping you want, whereas before there was a key combination for each ping type).\n\nNow that I'm getting my base set up and things automated, I'm having a lot of fun! It's always cool to see your progress so clearly.\n\nThere are some bugs which is to be expected since it's an early-access game. Most annoying is that the x64 executable likes to go missing, so I've been playing with x32. There are infrequent crashes, and if you quit when anything is in your smelter the items get lost. Not a bug but slightly annoying when I first started playing: menus that don't completely work. Now that I know the features haven't been implemented it's fine, but before I was clicking and totally confused as to why nothing was happening.\n\nThe roadmap the developers have is great, and they seem to be very active here on Steam. Nice to know they're listening! Things I would like to see added are some ideas or guides for power plants and things like that, more detailed graphics (though I'm fine playing with the current ones), and maybe trees that regrow themselves. That would be cool. Seeds and stuff would be neat too.\n\nAnyways, it's a great game and awesome for the price and all the stuff they have planned.","May 8, 2014","true","25.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","2"

This doesn't mean the game is bad however, it's just that I can't play a game for that long haha.\n\nDefinitely a recommended title though and I enjoyed following its development from a relatively small Early Access title to what it has become now.

The game focuses on pulling resources out of the ground, and automating the process.  There is also a fun base defence aspect where the threat increases depending on how big your operation is.  The game allows and encourages you to really scale things up to a massive operation with tons of defences.\n\nThis is completely different game then Minecraft, but it is very similar to Minecraft with industrial and automation mods.  The key difference for me  is that it's much more cohesive and balanced then slapping tons of mods on to Minecraft.","August 30, 2015","true","146.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Once I opted into the beta, and selected some easier difficulty options, I found a game that was somewhat similar to some of the tech mods for minecraft, but with far more depth and coherence.   But this game, unlike minecraft, or most other mining games for that matter, requires you to build infrastructure that mines and processes for you, rather than you mining yourself.   The early mining process requires you to locate a sutible ore vein, plop down a ore extracter on it, stick a storage hopper on it, and dump a bunch of power into it, and leave it for about 10 minuites before coming back, recharging it, and taking the ore to refine.\nHowever, every step of that process is automatable, from the very start of the game.   Progression gives you faster, more efficient ways to mine, and automate the mining devices, while encouraging you to dig deeper to get access to more valuable ores, to research and build more advanced and effective machines.\n\nPros\n-Advancing tech keeps you building and modifying structures\n-Tower defense aspect adds mid and end game goals\n-Scanning and visual tools lets you quickly plan out the most efficent way to set up and debug structures\n-All the information needed to progress can be found in game, no immersion breaking forum trips needed\n-Large difficulty range\n-Multiplayer (Still buggy, will likely be improving with time)\n-EXPLOSIVES that you can make as powerful as you have power for (maybe not so great in multiplayer)\n\nCons\n-Not much in the way of a wiki to look up information for optimizing setups, particularly base defense\n-Single threaded- hard to run unless your computer has relatively good single thread performance (I have an AMD 3.7 GHz processor, and I have to run it on a lower graphics setting to avoid framerate drops)\n-Mob difficulty tends to get grouped- if you want things to fight back, you also have to deal with ore eating mobs that spawn on your conveyers.\n-Falling too fast kills you, makes it somewhat hard to go down mineshafts, you have to spend a fair amount of time building and navigating stairwells or platforms\n-Some dead spots while waiting for materials to be mined or refined","September 10, 2015","true","118.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","2"

Just... Wow.\n\nWhere to start? This is a really well thought out, high quality game that encourages players to take advantage of its in-depth building system to achieve levels of creativity not found in other craft games.\n\nMixing exploration with creativity, the game world modes cater for just about any gamer. Survival mode is possibly the most interesting, feeling fresh and challenging to just about any gamer. Survival mode gives a subtle drive to the creative player, besides creating visually stunning environments.\n\nOther modes offer a more relaxed experience, with vareity to suit the player. All modes are customizable in terms of difficulty and resources, in order to create the most suitable game world for the player.\n\nThough in terms of fun, multiplayer is where it's at. Co-op mode is a blast and working alongside your buddies to create and delve is great.\n\nVisually the game blows most other craft games out of the water. The textures have a hand made, consistent quality not often seen in games today, and compliment the models considerably. The sheer level of effort put into the visuals is very noticable, and the torch light in underground areas is pretty cool, gives a real sense of exploration.\n\nThe sound effects are great and the music is decent, complimenting gameplay. Listening to the ambient wintery wind howl as you dig and search for resources in survival mode is pretty awesome. Gives a real sense of being in the game.\n\nBest thing though? The deep building system. You can do all kinds of cool stuff like powering generators with coal or materials for equipment energy, check out objects to find their hidden secrets with your laser scanner, craft new gear with materials you find along the way. It has to be seen to be believed really.\n\nSadly the game has had some slating in the past owing to early beta releases, though in comparison the game has gone leaps and bounds miles away from what it came from (and I hope past reviewers amend their posts.) and exceeded my expectations.\n\nOverall, the game is a great choice for craft game fans and players who want to dip their feet into the world of creative games. Highly recommended.\n10/10\n\n\n","November 4, 2015","true","3.8"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

Survival is NOT finished.\n\nThe game is cool,I do like building and mining.\n\nSurvival is fine but there really is no point in building defences there is no monsters no danger like in survival Minecraft.\n\nThe constant fear of freezing to death is very annoying,make sure to bring lots of torches if you want to explore and mine,everyone says upgrade your suit but its kinda hard when ya have to find the minerals to build the stuff to upgrade your suit. Most of the minerals are very hard to find except for the basic ores or if you do find them you don't get much of them,so its hard to upgrade your suit when the ores ya need are hard to find.\n\nThe graphics are nice.\n\nOver all the game is cool but its still in early development hopefully they fix things.\n\nI reccomend this game but don't expect it to be a clone of Mincraft,feels unfinished.\n\n","April 23, 2015","true","26.1"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

Not a finished product but still a great way to waste several days of your life, there's nothing like snaking kilometers of conveyors through caverns taller than the depth-limit on minecraft, all so you can sit back and watch your machines dutifully smelt exotic ores while you sit back and have a cup of tea.","August 27, 2015","true","118.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I mostly play games like terraria, FTL and minecraft. I make a new review so that I can point out the positive pieces.\n\nEnergy system, ores, ingots, intermediate building materials such as PCB:s, copper plates...\n\nIt is a bit difficult to move far away from your home base since the power quickly drains. Besides that, I say it's a challenge. So far, I haven't got to the point where I think this game has "everything". The most bothersome challenge is moving far away from the home base and finding the resources that you need. Canalizing coal into the main hub is one of the most usual things that you will do in the beginning. This is done by hand (taking coal from a mining block into your infinite inventory space, then staying at the base until it has enough power).\n\nI imagine that a larger operation would take a lot of time. I sporadically play games with or without liking them, so I would usually not recommend this game because "bitterness". But I got into it a bit more by watching someone making a let's play on it. For example, the tutorial in the beginning was added with the latest patch. Before that, I had to watch the let's play in order to know what to do. Mostly, games like minecraft gain introduction level experience by being simple. As complexity adds to the time that you spend fumbling around, these "cellular automata" games almost require an intro course.\n\nI have no idea how to get the complexity that the game promotes by its videos. As usual, the actual gameplay is similar to any minecraft-like game. As usual, there is some difficulty getting to the point where you feel you've achieved something. Things like putting coal in the main hub will predate the point where you've found your first source of copper.\n\nTips:\nX <--- changes to block breaker\nM <--- changes to block scanner/pinger\nL  <--- turns on lights (drains energy)\nThe scanner is necessary to find the first piece of copper deep below ground.\n\nRight now, candles are extremely cheap (infinite power!) and craves coal which you get cheap in the beginning (most of the times)\nC <--- open crafting menu, where you can craft candles on the go","August 15, 2015","true","3.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","7"

The scanning and progression system give it a unique feel to it, helping it stand out. It isn't trying to become a minecraft clone either which is refreshing.

Sure it has some bugs and glitches but it is barely done! I want to go over the glitches and bugs before I get to the best parts first just in case someone wants to find out what the issues may be in the game.\n\nThe glitches are quite bad sometimes and can seriously affect the gameplay, the glitches come at random moments, usually when you least expect it. We have the problem with not being in control any more, this happens a lot, it causes your player to just fly up into the sky when you press space bar, this can also make it impossible to float back down and usually I just turn the game off after that. We also have the copy and paste option, sometimes it leaves blue and green lights stuck on your walls, sometimes the wall has holes in it where the copy and paste didn't work properly. You've even got a glitch that makes you walk around when you don't want to and you have to just move to a block and wait until the player stops moving, then slowly tap on the 'W' key to make sure he/she doesn't do it again. There is also even on fastest graphics mode it can have a huge drop in frame rates quite rapidly. Don't let this scare you from buying this game.\n\nI think this game is a must have due to its great potential, there aren't a lot of blocks but they are still developing the game and once it is done I am hoping it will have a larger collection of different blocks and materials. It's also a really big world and plenty of worlds for you to make, the copy and paste functions is pure genius and will definantly help to build huge structures! The little robot that follows you is helpful to show what block you currently have and for some reason it looks kind of cute. I'm very serious when I say this game has huge potential! I hope that more people buy this game so they can get more money to develop it better and faster! If you're looking for a game of fun and adventure then this game is for you! If you don't mind the bugs and just get on with it then this is extremely fun, this is my own opinion though so don't take it all to heart. But if anyone wants to join me when they have finished constructing the multiplayer then please feel free to add me. I hope this game gets the recognition it deserves! I remember first playing it on the xbox and it was a really good experience, I felt like I was playing something so different to games like MineCraft and it was a new adventure for me and that is why this game brings back that good feeling of change in the sandbox gaming category.","March 8, 2014","true","8.0"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","6"

But I've a simple rule: Games that are incomplete and not marked early access get the thumbs down.\n\nThere are many resources with descriptions like "not implemented yet" or "has no use yet, but will soon." There are big mechanics of the game (losing a base assault for example) which don't do anything. The game is quite playable and enjoyable, but it's not even in beta yet.\n\nAlot of people were complaining about this game, and honestly I think it was because they didn't understand the mechanics. I remember one guy complaining that generators don't work underground so you can't go very deep... i guess he didn't see all the power transmission devices? But then, blocky games with "craft" in the title are clearly targetting the minecraft audience, and I think this game requires a bit more maturity to understand.\n\nThe game really is pretty good, although a bit rough around the edges. I think the game could use a rebalance to make resource management less cumbersome. Specifically, late game components (mk III lasers for example) take quite a few resources to build. But hey, it's an automation game so that's perfectly reasonable, you just need to build more mines. The problem is that if you build enough mines to keep those your factory making those at a reasonable pace, the storage of resources becomes a nightmare.\n\nIn my situation, I've got two or three machines making late game components, and my storage facility (which is really big btw) is either completely empty, or overflowing to the point where my transit lines jam up. I'm constantly running up and down my mine to turning drills on and off so that my storage won't overflow, becase honestly (and here's the important part) it's easier to turn them on and off then to make a storage facility large enough to support the flow.\n\nI often see the developer on the forums asking things like "what would you like to see?" I'd like to see cheaper storage and transport in the early game (so you can ramp up faster without all the waiting for tin bars), and higher tier transport and storage in the late game. Just something as simple as a "super hopper" that's expensive but holds 1000 resources would go a long way. A faster transport system then the tubes would be nice too (or maybe mk 4 lasers and more powerful matter-movers). Just something along those lines.\n\nAnyway, that's my take on it. I love the factory games, and this is the best 3D one I've found, although it still has a long way to go. To those who like the automation aspects of this game, do make a point of looking at Factorio though, because it is the best IMHO.","April 13","false","330.3"," 22 of 37 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","22","37","0","5"

Taking advantage of the power of a modern PC with several times more RAM and processing power compared to that of the aging console, FC:E offers a more expansive world than ever before.\n\nThe game builds upon its success from the console version by offering the best creative tools available in any vox game including:\nSuperbuild - An interface to quickly build geometric structures of thousands of blocks to save time for the detail work\nPaint gun - Paint select blocks using nearly any color you could dream\nDetail blocks - the micro blocks of the XBLIG version have returned with even more flexibility.  Choose from 2x2 - 8x8 blocks in your detail block design to add a finer touch to your world.  The PC version allows a nearly inexhaustible collection so you'll have plenty of options to add more detail to your world.\nCopy and paste - Take a unique design and reproduce it to fill in your world with color or simplify a large project by reducing it to a set of duplicable pieces by copying and pasting elements of your world.\nBuild2me - Excellent for covering roofs, building bridges, or filling in gaps build2me allows you to place an entire line of blocks from your target all the way to your current location.\nHigh graphical fidelity  - Incredible texture resolution, whole array of shaders, and a lighting engine that must be seen to be believed makes an incredible project look that much better.\n\nAll of these provide the player with the tools necessary to build beautiful constructions of a scale that until now has been unimaginable in a vox game.  In this regard it is a huge step forward from the console version.  As of the time of writing this review the primary missing feature from the creative toolbox is animating the detail blocks.  This feature has yet to return but remains on the roadmap so expect it to appear before the full release.  I highly recommend checking out some of the Top rated screenshots to see some of the incredible things players have built already using the engine.\n\nOne of the most desired elements that I had waited on with the console version was the development of a survival oriented game to make the most of the engine.  That time has finally come as the survival mode has seen its public debut and with only a few weeks of development time it already shows promise for an entertaining experience that will last many, many hours.  The player is dropped into a world where the environment itself is hostile.\n\nThe early game has the player battling the cold by sustaining a supply of energy to power his high tech hazard suit to prevent freezing to death by hypothermia.  The suit also appears to be designed for heat, radiation, low oxygen levels, and toxic environments so expect to see a variety of hazards to face from the world itself.  As of the time of writing the cold is the only threat.  Although the suit can be heated up by standing on a torch there is no danger from heat yet.  It will attempt to consume energy to keep you cool however.\n\nThe gameplay centers around the idea of your suit energy being your life and that venturing far from your main energy network is a great risk.  You'll spend much of your time developing a network of power distribution to your mining network which is driven by machines called extractors which collect ore from resource nodes albeit at a slow pace.  This process is slower than the player's own mining ability however it is more efficient and automated as long as you sustain the machines with energy.  Later on you gain the ability to make batteries to store power and provide it to your machines, lasers which are used to move power between batteries, a generator for burning coal to produce power, hoppers to collect the resources from the extractors, and robots to move items among the hoppers.  The end result is the complete automation of your mining operations and the ability to generate and move energy around your base of operations to keep everything alive and moving including yourself!\n\nA few other relevant bits about the mode: torches can be placed as a source of light and heat.  They serve as little beacons of safety in the harsh world.  The player is provided with a grappling hook to quickly climb from the depths as the world goes down many light years.  Surival mode currently only utilizes the first several hundred blocks down but will eventually stretch to several thousand meters underground.  The player has a handy ore/cave sensor which consumes a quarter of your suit energy but provides an indicator of the closest ore/cave from the player.  This removes some of the tedium associated with finding resources and just getting about underground.\n\nAll of this is only after about a month of development.  There is already a list of planned features to expand upon the mode including suit upgrades such as increased energy storage, greater insulation from the cold, upgrades to the ore sensor to identify specific ore types, and more.  The first mob was added to the game which is a real treat.  The details of which I won't provide here as they are more fun to discover on your own. :)  He isn't much of a threat yet but I'm sure that will change as the tools necessary to combat him are added.  In the current state it takes several hours to proceed through the current tech tree and with additional features promising to fill out the game the survival mode is shaping up to be an incredibly entertaining experience that will be even more fun with friends given the natural scale of the game.\n\nIt is now I should probably place a reminder here of the normal warnings of early access games.  This is an early access title so it isn't complete yet.  Among the features still missing that is probably most desirable is multiplayer.  It is on the roadmap and even in development right now.  The devs have the game roadmap[www.fortresscraft.com] including multiplayer progress on their website where you can keep track of progress if you don't wish to buy in immediately.  As mentioned above the animations are not available for detail blocks and survival mode is only a month into development.  Other areas that still need work include the menus where many options are still unavailable and do not use a mouse interface yet.\n\nIn the end I guess the question that matters most is: Is it worth it?  If you enjoyed the creative experience offered by the XBLIG version or are looking for a more powerful block builder than you can get with other PC titles then FC:E is already a must buy.  If the survival experience is more what you are after then the answer isn't as clear.  Although the game is progressing very quickly it is still far from complete and there are many features required to fill out the experience.  There is also a lot of bug fixing and optimization needed as so much is being thrown into the game so quickly.  If you absolutely must have the end result then it is worth buying now at the introductory rate which is said to be 40% of the final price and will increase with each major milestone.  If you still are unsure then be sure to check out the forums regularly as new patches are released multiple times a week with fixes and new content.  At the rate the game is currently moving it will be making a big name for itself in voxel gaming this year.","January 13, 2014","true","690.2"," 46 of 83 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","46","83","0","3"

Plain and simple. It's like someone played MineCraft and thought, "Well, this is pretty fun. What else can it do?" So they dug through mods and found Technic. Then they played that for a bit and thought, "This, too, is pretty fun. But it wasn't really made for this...I bet I could make something like this, but better." And so they did.\n\nStarting out can be rough, depending on your world. I tried a couple before I found one I was happy with. It will take time.The game is heavily based around automation, so you can continue to dig deeper and find new things, then automate those new things to get it all back to your base. At first, you will have to babysit things. You simply don't have the resources to get things rolling on their own for the first hour, maybe two. Watch a couple of videos on it. You'll see how others do things, you'll get a good understanding of the basics, and you'll have some ideas as to how to set your own system up. It takes a lot of time to really get a lot going on, but if building up to that isn't your cup of tea, then I might advise a different game type. There are several more mechanics at play here than in MineCraft, and pretty much any other game in this vein. It takes a lot of the concepts explored in Space Engineers, removes space, and instead focuses on mining materials and setting them up to work for you.\n\nNever played anything else quite like it. As of this writing, the devs have moved to a new engine and made several quality of life improvements. There are more updates coming, and the community that I've interacted with is outstanding. This is a prime example of an early access game taking full advantage of what gamers can bring to a development cycle.","March 8","true","130.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

There are updates about every 2~3 weeks now that it has been released, which I am ok with (I am refering to the Patch # content, which are rather large updates).\n\nA lot of people have compared it to minecraft but main difference is that there is no weapon or armor upgrade for your character.  This is mainly because this is more of a tower defense type game, so if you are looking for a shooter this won't be it.\n\nMy only gripe with the game is that you cannot move your starting Central Power Hub (CPH) which basically forces you to build at your start point since that is what you have to protect.  It would be nice if you could relocate your base.","April 19","true","438.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Its a port of a game that's been on consoles for some time now, and is still a work in progess so things are going to be pretty rough. Despite its shortcomings this game has a lot of potential to be serious competition for Minecraft, which up until now has had no real competition on the PC side.\n\nThere are things that need to be fixed. You still get the Creative Mode item list in Survival Mode, making it hard to determine which blocks you have available, and you cannot use the mouse in your inventory screen. In fact, you can't use the mouse in any of the interfaces for the game except for the ESC button menu while in-game. This needs to be addressed, especially for this PC port of the game.\n\nAs I said, this game has massive potential, so while its not quite ready yet if you buy the game now you're helping the developers out so they can finish it that much faster. So, while its very rough as an alpha this is one worth investing in.","January 10, 2014","true","2.6"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

Want it to go faster? Simply increase whatever factor is limiting your progress, be it power, materials, or machine throughput.\n\nJust as you're getting the hang of all this, you'll come across the Threat Analyser and probably end up building one out of curiosity. This will warn you of incoming attacks and keep you informed as to how much attention your base is drawing from the native life forms. Very useful in determining when you really need to change your focus to building defences against said life forms, but again on the easier settings the only penalty for failure is that it temporarily stops your source of comepletely free power.\n\nI've restarted this game several times now, because after developing my base setup a certain way I get further then come up with a better way to do things, which would almost certainly be easier if I did it from the very beginning. The fact that this game can still cause such epiphanies is to me a mark of a very well thought out game indeed.  That said, I could just tear it all apart with no penalty, and rebuild, but I prefer a clean slate.\n\nThe game is undergoiong continual development on a daily basis. This does not mean that the game is unfinished, having watched the developer's daily live streams of the work being done I can say that it if the game had stayed in Early Access until he ran out of ideas and had implemented all the current thoughts he has for late-game content, it would still be Early Access ten years from now, and the game already far surpasses many titles that I've seen launched from EA.\n\nIt's true that the developer is planning explansion packs as a way to introduce large chunks of extra content to the game, and a lot of people have slammed this decision, despite the fact that he has clearly said that if he can afford to do so, these will be free expansion packs rather than paid.  Given how many games are released in an almost episodic fashion these days, this is by no means unreasonable, especially given the exceptional value for money the FCE represents. How many games can give hundreds of hours of enjoyment for £10?\n\nAt this price give it a try, it's a steal and if you enjoy any kind of tower defence, voxel building, crafting, gathering or logistics/assembly line games you should have a blast.\n\nTl/dr: A great game that keeps getting better.","April 18","true","408.5"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

I still feel I'm maybe only 1/3 into the game and there's still so much more content to keep exploring in the game with all the machines, ways to use them and interoperability, it's great.\n\nThere are not any noticable bugs which I have noticed and I have personally seen how the developer has dedicated his time by watching his development stream where he is creating and growing the game.  That being said, I recommend you watch it to get a feel for his passion for improving this game continuously and takes direct customers input to add content and keep rebalancing the game.  He does this because he loves his game and it sounds like it will be around for a long long time and I am tempted to become a patreon as well because the game has so much already paid for itself in pure enjoyment.\n\nThat being said, if you happen to be reading any earlier reviews about bugs/etc, I would take them very lightly because they most likely have been resolved and the game is very solid.\n\nHope you pick up the game!

It has all of the creative potential of minecraft, but automation removes all the boring negatives like manually mining and smelting and even building block by block. Instead of wasting time on that boring nonsense, FortressCraft Evolved allows you to focus on advancing your tech, building your base, and defeating your enemies!\n\nThere are tons of awesome aspects of the tech aspect of this game, with my favorite being the ability to build blocks from a specified block to your location using control-click. AFAIK, minecraft doesn't let you do this. At least, it didn't back in the day when I played it. Also, this game has a grappling hook. Let me repeat that for you. THIS GAME HAS A GRAPPLING HOOK. AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO UNLOCK IT. There are multiple power source types for your machine, and your enemies (bees native to the world you're stranded on) provide you with valuable building materials. There's a lot of variety in every aspect of the game: building, smelting, mining, etc.\n\nAlso, this game is gorgeous for what it is. I'm running it on an intel g3258 that I haven't gotten around to overclocking yet and an AMD r9 270 and it still runs decently on high-ish settings. And it works on linux! :D\n\nThere are a lot of complaints from earlier in the game's development about the creator abandoning the project. He came back, and has been consistently releasing updates since the beginning of the year. He's a bit snarky, but he's really fun to interact with, and he actually listens to player feedback.\n\nBasically, this game is everything an indy game should be. Fun, inventive, varied, cheap, and available across all platforms. What are you waiting for??

A minecraft map is 128 blocks from the tip top of the ceiling to the very bottom of bedrock, with only around 60-80 of those being actual land blocks and not empty space. In Fortresscraft, you keep digging down to progress further in the game, and right now I think the last zone is around 1000 blocks or so with plans to develop layers even deeper than that.\n\nSecond is the uh, the holoview or whatever, where you hit a button and you can see all your constructions through walls.

I enjoy playing something that requires a bit of OCD, creativity and structure with its playstyle.  What can be more fun than building your own defense while mining and exploring i thought to myself!  600+ hours later i still enjoy the game, starting a new world and looking for the ore to upgrade my base.  I enjoy how i can automate the entire production of items and ore.  Place things as far away as i want and transport them to where i need.  I do not really have anything bad to say about this game, specially since many of the complains that i did have are now mute since the developer pays special attention to what the supports of this game wants to see.  At the most i would like to see a veriety of different enemies instead of just wasps that fly naturally instead of their direct path.  this game easily scores an 7/10 and climbing.","March 30","true","639.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

The similarities disappear shortly after that. The build gun is an amazing tool for building or removing blocks at long range and is capable of building large platforms or walls very quickly. Most of the game is based on automation of resources or manufacturing, similar to Factorio. The game play in single player seems to flow through 3 distinct types of gameplay: you start off in a survival game, fighting the elements and trying to just manage; mid-game is filled with automation of all sorts, from power generation and transport, to quarrying, refining materials you obtain, and auto-crafting items; end-game is similar to a tower defense game, fighting hordes of enemies, trying to keep them from destroying your Central Power Hub and resetting the charge on your end-game structure.

There were probably three or four minutes in the entire day of total playtime that I actually enjoyed myself. But the more I invested myself in the game, the more I felt determined to get something out of it, and the more time I shoved into it. I spent almost all of yesterday (5/16/2016) playing, desperately trying to make progress.\nThere are several problems with making progress.\nFirst off, this is not a single player game. It may have the ability to be played single player, but it's not single player. There just isn't enough progress for it to be single player. In order to make a reasonable amount of progress on my own, I edited files in order to vastly speed up my gameplay. Somehow, that made it go from very boring to incredibly boring.\nNothing happens quickly on your own. Even with the game settings set all the way to the quickest, easiest, fastest settings. You need 32 bars of something to build x. Well, settle in, that'll take a while unless you've already got five or six systems running. And it's not like setting those up is quick. Or cheap.\nAnd don't get me started on how long it takes to research pretty much anything once you've got the laboratory. The projects take ages to complete, and enough resources that after a day of highly sped-up gameplay, I was barely able to make some of it.\nBut that's not the worst part about this game.\nThis game is NOT finished. This game was early-access, and still should be! It's nowhere near complete. I find bugs everywhere I go. I come back to my base and all my turrets are facing firmly in one direction, a giant laser firing out. The ship I crashed in is on fire (it's only been two months in-game since I landed, I'm sure that's normal). The CPH is projecting some kind of field that is making it awfully hard to see. Various other things are making all sorts of very bright frames of animation that make it practically impossible for me to see what the hell is happening in my base.\nMy laser turrets are still working fine. It's just impossible to tell that.\nI place another laser turret on top of another block I've placed, and all the bugs disappear in an instant.\nBefore I do that, the ship hurts me if I get too close.\nNow? No worries, I can walk straight through it.\nI assure you, this is one of many, many bugs that I've encountered. The list got so long I didn't bother remembering them.\nThen, there's the simple fact that some things are either badly implemented, have missing icons, mismatched icons, or maybe their help file doesn't exist.\nMake some iron pipe if you can. Or find something that requires iron pipe and look at the picture. As of this moment, the picture is a big red x and the words "NO ICON". Go grab some cave flora from the cold or toxic caverns. One of each. Then, place them. Place them against a wall, and turn them twice, so they're actually right-side-up. Don't ask why. Now, compare the flora you just placed to the icon. They're mismatched. A is B, B is A, C is D, etc.\nHow about auto-excavators? Place one on a wall, and you'll probably think it can dig a 3x3 hole horizontally. Maybe if you place it on the ceiling, it can dig down, instead of up! Why would you think that? Because the column of light indicating where it can dig shows that!\nYou'd be wrong. Once you power it up, no matter where you're trying to 'aim' it, it shoots up.\nThe list goes on. There are things that are just plain problematic. Things that are useless. Things that make no sense. Things that are poorly implemented, buggy, unfinished, and more. It is, quite frankly, awful, and if you look at the pictures saying "Oh, I want that!", then either join a server with a dozen other players or be prepared to keep playing for WEEKS (Actual time played, not number of days you played for a little while) in order to get there.","May 17","false","24.4"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","20","35","0","8"

Fortresscraft Evolved is a complete remake of the original Fortresscraft in the Unity engine and was released on Steam Dec 10, 2013.\n\nA lot of people will go ahead and compare this game to Minecraft and, while it does share some similarities with my all-time favorite game, it is actually quite different, especially in terms of creative building. There is a survival mode in the game, but when I tried to start a new world with it, I was placed in creative mode. No idea why that happened.\n\nThe creative mechanics in the game are fantastic. There are many features that make building a lot easier than what you'd probably expect from a game like this (try shift+left clicking with a block in hand). I was even able to whip up a quick tree house in about 30 seconds, and this was no ordinary tree house, it was massive. I really love what the devs did to make creative building as painless as possible.\n\nThe game does have some technical issues however, with the game sound being my major complaint. They seemed to lag behind. Oh, and is there supposed to be game music? I heard some at one point, but, other than that, it appears to be nonexistent.\n\nAnyways, the game is fun, if you know what you're doing. The survival mode, however, simply is not as fun as I had expected it to be.

Let me first start with my opinion. I love this game. However, I can not recomend it as of yet. I spent 24 hours fo game time as of the time I've written this, and I still don't really have a clue what's going on. It's advertised as a tower defense mincraft clone, but I've never played minecraft, so I'm not really sure if it is. I really like the idea of having to dig to find minerals, the blocks you can remove, the things you can research, but I don't like having to search outside the game or go through a million other steps to get a general idea of what I should be doing.\n\nLet's start off with the 10 second tutorial. It sucks so bad, after the first time I booted the game up and watched the unskippable (in this day and age, really?!) opening scene, I had no real idea of what to do or how. Sure, there is a help menu that gradually fills up with more information as you need it, but isn't the point of the tutorial to teach you what you need to know? There's no real explination of day or night, no real explination of what you can craft, and nothing tells you what you're research unlocks until you've already researched it.\n\nNow the community is great, and all the answers can be found someplace, but to me, that takes time away from the game. It's advertised as a tower defense, but it's more like a base defense, eventually. I'm not going to get into the nitty gritty, but this game needs a ton of polish before I can actually recommend it to anyone. The learning curve is HUGE in this game, and I'm still finding things out the more I play, but if that's your thing, feel free.\n\nUpdate: With the new patch that came out, I truly do love this game more. I still can't recommend it though until it does some serious polishing. No game ever should keep basic things away from the player, and that level of transparency is exactly what this games lacks. It's also unbelievably slow. I've been playing for days and there are still things that are hidden from me and I have no idea what they do until I actually spend the 5-6 hours unlocking it. As a player, it's truly the only reason I keep this game thumbs down.","March 27","false","86.8"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","14","24","0","3"

The concept of the game is awesome, but gameplay is a bit confusing. Tooltips would be great on graphics options and maybe a bit more perfomance optimization because I seem to get a huge amount of lag, whether I'm recording or not, and I've turned all graphics settings way down. The lag is a lot less, but still too much with all graphics settings set so low. That being said, the game is in early access, and there's always going to be issues with early access. The future of this game could bring a lot of positives, and I am hopeful for this!

You'll certainly feel the grind early on, as you work to gather resources. Getting to know the controls is a must; mining ores using only the automatic things is slow, so make sure to read through the controls to get to know all the stuff you can do to save time (Superdig is invaluable). I never really got to any of the advanced machinery, as the grind just got a tad boring. Also, the creative mode's fun, I guess. All the block textures are highly situational, which is my main gripe with the game. Other than that, it's a fine game.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anybody with some time to burn (this game is great for passing time; one moment it'll be 8PM and the next it's 2AM) and a bit of money to spare. It's nothing outstanding, but it is certainly the sort of game you can use as a filler between games.\n\nEDIT: After some of the more recent updates, I've found that the game can be a fair bit more fun. I found the combat (while flawed in some areas, like the lack of a crosshair and the charged shot doing nothing more than the regular shot) to be rather fun.\n\nAlso, after messing around in creative (I was exclusively playing survival to this point) I found that the detail blocks have been MASSIVELY improved since Chapter 1. The ability to have the block textures as either scaled or not is a brilliant addition, because that was one of my main issues with the original. The detail blocks can actually be used for seamless detailing, which is brilliant.\n\nIt certainly is an improvement on Chapter 1 in near enough every way, and (in some ways) is better than Minecraft for building larger creations. With the addition of texture pack support, I should hopefully be able to customise the game to the way I would like, which is a brilliant feature.\n\nOverall, I'm changing my rating from "time waster" to "generally good game". It's a good game in pretty much all aspects (if a little buggy at times. I'm looking at you, spiderbot on hills. But that's just hilarious) and great in others.","September 18, 2015","true","23.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

This will be complicated.\n\nFirst off, full disclosure: I recieved this game from the Dev after expressing my doubts and disbelief on the forums. The topic can be found here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/254200/discussions/0/528398719792747294/\n\nAnd on to the review itself...\n\nFortresscraft is something I have difficulty playing objectively. I snagged the original back when I was a gamer on the Xbox 360 before switching to PC, and I was not impressed. It was a 'Minecraft clone', in the sense that it was blocky and HD and there was not much value in it other than blowing up the water and watching the broken physics for it cause it to spread across the entire world, but only after you had reloaded the level.\n\nUpon seeing this title on Steam, I was, understandably, not impressed. So, after downloading the Dev-given game and booting it up, I found a few things out.\n\nFirst, the game has some derps and issues. The tutorial can be confusing and derped at times, leaving you with little idea of what to do. I have heard there's a wiki up at this point, but there was not one when I started.\n\nYou enter with little idea of how to do things, which can honestly be great. I've played Dwarf Fortress with less. Still, however, it's not a great introduction.\n\nFurther on, I can see hints that this is something that I might enjoy and thrive in if I could only get it, for lack of a better word. It's not that the game is complex, it's that I just can't figure out where to go, after a bit. So many things that would really improve things for me are either missing, or I am not finding them.\n\nI know, and I can see, that this is really a good game, especially where it came from. I did have a bit of fun, and the mechanics are mostly solid, but I just couldn't get very far.\n\nOverall, the reason this is 'recommended' is because, in the end, I know it's a good game. It just isn't my type of game. I'll stick with my complex RTS addiction for my fix.\n\nIn numbers: 6/10. Above average, at least. Steam really needs a 'mixed' review setting.","March 7","true","3.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Not only was it the mobs, but it was also not being able to use generators where we wanted to.  You can have a generator in a game to provide power, but lasers were unfortunately more favored over generators for some reason.  One day, a game will come out, that will be a factory game, no mobs, and no BS, and that is the game I am looking for.  Full automation with no interruptions.\n\nIn the end, no I do not recommend this game.\n\nRight now I am 50/50 on my review.  I have been playing the game with no mob AI and have actually been loving it.  It's a nice change from playing Minecraft all day long.\n\nWhat I enjoy most about the game, is the fact that you need machines to gather resources, mainly your ores, and that you can use conveyor belts to move all your materials around.  I've worked a warehouse job where it was conveyor belt city almost, and one conveyor belt at this job, took 10 minutes to get the product from the machine to me, where I had to sort it with other packages.  So the game in it's current state is pretty wild.  So I recommend it based on how it's different from Minecraft, you can build and destroy blocks from almost any range, and how its got all this factory stuff.  I believe there are mods for Minecraft for factory, but I enjoy playing this game as it offers a much different feeling and gives a different look.\n\nRecent changes however will be approaching, and this is where I am undecided on a full recommendation.  Changes will be coming that will give the mobs an AI, meaning they can drain power or screw with your machines functioning unless you plop down turrets.  To begin, alot of items to build are very expensive, and that problem needs addressed.  Another recent change to the game was how generators work.  Before, you could use generators anywhere for power.  Now, generators will only work so far underground, then you are forced to use lasers.  My laser system is getting to be pretty crazy, trying to drag down as much power as I can, and it feels like a never ending battle to even be able to keep power running.  There have been recent game code fixes to the lasers in how they operate.  I personally dislike the lasers altogether, but I'm really trying to give them a chance.\n\nThe other problem that I have, is that, I would love to just be able to operate a factory, with no interruptions, but that isn't going to be added as a seperate option.  A simple option to start a new game with no mobs, cannot or will not be included.  A few people have asked for this, but all have been given a "no this is not an option" answer.  The way indie games are made today, community input is helpful, and when that input is actually used in the game, that's even better, and I believe that indie developers should always keep an open mind about different things they can and cannot include.  What I'm saying is, if the game Minecraft can have a no mob option, come on, it really shouldn't be that hard for you to include it as well.  But I'm not saying that it needs to be included right away.  I'm just saying, it is an option, and it shouldn't be ruled out so quickly.  Once the game gets more closer to completion, then add in the option to turn off the mobs.  Personally, I'm not looking forward to the mobs in the game, because I was hoping to just run a factory.\n\nThe more you cater to your players and fans of the game, the more they will see you in a better light.  Then, mix it up a bit and change something that players wouldn't feel is too game breaking, or that on a forum, you have ideas and can go over those ideas with your playerbase.  This happens already, but that transparency is what people want nowadays, and the developers have 100% transparency with their playerbase.\n\nIt's really just the no mob thing.  Never entirely rule something out if it can be a possible option added in later on.  I play Minecraft so much, that I'm getting tired of mobs.  Which is why I have so much play time with this game.  It's pretty much you building and running a factory, but then here come the mobs.\n\nIt's a good game, and if you like having to use machines to get things done, then you should get it.\n\nIt is still in its early stages so it will be going through many changes I'm sure.","July 5, 2015","false","180.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The world made of cubes and mining had already been around before minecraft, and moreover its an aesthetic that is not something minecraft owns. If you can't get past the "all cube based games are minecraft copies" then stop reading here, onto the meat.\n\nPros:\n\n1. This is a common one yet still important, the option to play with high or low difficulty in finding ore, the strength of hostiles, and even obtaining the energy you will so dearly need throughout the game. This is important as being able to enjoy the game from both a higher level and casual standpoint is a must.\n\n2. The hostiles, they are exactly what should be in a game like this, instead of only straight forward hit you and the face type ememies you have an enemy that will attach itself to your conveyor belts and such and devour all your ores making its nest ( the hivemind ) larger, and a little stealth cube thing that will drain power from your mining set up underground. Better yet, they still include a straight forward hit you in the face mob, and a little or dropping resource mob to boot for your tin needs.\n\n3. Instead of making you dig out a staircase, one of the most tedious  hardships one usually faces in "cube games", this game offers a high powered grappling hook, you can dig straight down and then grapple back up, this may seem overpowered however it will already take you quite some time to acquire resources and set up your automated mining and power system, if getting back to the surface were to take forever each time this game would be rendered unplayable by those of us who just dont have enough time.\n\n4. The automation that can be achieved in this game is satisfying, when you go from having to run back in forth to your copper mine set up to watching the copper roll in on a conveyor into your hopper then into your smelter, and at the moment you are looking at the 200+ stack of copper, you will feel a level of satisfaction on par with properly heating a plate of pizza rolls and not burning your tongue and throat.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Despite what I said earlier about the hostiles, the game could probably use a bit more in this area, if you know what you are doing they are pretty easy to handle as is, there doesnt need to be too much more of this but some for sure.\n\n2. The learning curve, if you dont watch some videos, you are likely to flounder about having no idea what you are doing, this does hurt the game quite a bit. If you are against checking out some videos to figure things out this might be the deciding factor for you.\n\n3. Being a little to intense with the autmation, if you arent a fan creating (sometimes) complex systems to acquire, smelt, and convert your ore into useful objects then this game just isnt for you.\n\n4. The name, if you have played the old fortresscraft, then you go in expecting something quite different from what you will get, it is misleading and could be the leave a sour impression depending on whether you did your research or not.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI gave an equal number of pros and cons, what comes down to is if you enjoy automation, and thinking, then theres a pretty high chance you will enjoy this game, if not continue on, and if you arent into that, but you still want to give it a go, thats awesome.","January 6","true","9.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So I'd like to say my expectations were high. I had read FC Evolved was similar to Tekkit modded minecraft and I was getting excited.\nFirstly I dislike space themed anything - and this is definitely space themed - but I've found it to be fine.\n\nMy first 10mins of gameplay I was confused AF. It's fun to learn and work out what you have to do - which could be avoided by watching a gameplay of FC Evolved on YT, but I wanted to throw myself into the deep end. I'm at 20+hrs in, 17hrs of which in this one world, where I like to pretend I know what I'm doing. And I feel I've barely scratched the surface.  Once you figure out a methodology and approach, and are fast acting on it, I think you could have a world up and running a LOT faster than what I've done in this first attempt - and that's one of the selling points, become efficient.\n\nPros/ConsPros:\n+ Loads of gameplay\n+Looks pretty [I run at good, and occasionally stutters - my gfx card runs Farcry 4 at decent settings]\n+I love the mobility [compared to MC]\n+I love the grappling hook mechanic\n+I love ctrl+clicking to build 30blocks in a straight line\n+I love seeing a base grow and become automated\n+I love pressing K to find where I placed that ore extractor, because I totally forgot where I put it\n+Addicting gameplay\n+Always something to do/alter/change/move/collect/kill/mine/ping\n+You can leave it in the background/ALTTab and even on single player, the world continues to simulate - so if you have automated mining set up, you can do other things away from your PC and come back to collect smelted ores.\n\nCons:\n-I wish there was lights - early on. Throwing a bright green torch is ugly and hurts my eyes :')\n-I wish conveyor belts could be placed with ctrl+click, as that would save me time\n-I wish the music was better? A lot of annoying sounds. I find it actually nicer to play with sound off becaues of this.\n- Confusing progression.\n\nOverall, I paid ~$15.00 for it[?], and it has been worth it. I plan to put a lot more hours in.\n\nPS.S.\nI walked upto that giant squid monster and instantly died. My reasoning being I saw an unknown block at it's centre and I wanted to collect it :^).","March 15","true","135.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Really like this game. I find it hard to remain interested in games after a day of smashing them, but im still playing this one. So that says something pretty big. Also my mrs is starting to hate this game as im on it too much.\n\nPros\n-Exceptionally fast load time. once you double click the games shortcut, you are in world within a 15-20 seconds. great for those of us impatient or busy people. I really really hate bull**** loadtimes. I want to play a game not make a cup of coffee and come back while waiting for the main menu.\n\n-Good game progression.  for once a game that doesnt bog you down waiting for research, construction, or resource gathering/grinding. It has a nice balance of automation to the point where all that stuff can be done while you are off exploring. Ive often been off exploring a cavern and come back only to find that the slowest part of the system is myself and it is easy to get to the point of automation that most things become trivial (Wtf do i do with 5k copper now?)\n\n-enemies and death. you can make the game as hard as you like, and the consequences of death as permanent or trivial as you like in world gen. Which is really nice when you are still learning how to grapple around a massive cavern or falling down a really big hole.\n\n- The world. OMFG it is huge. The underground caverns are enormous, like really really really big and the terrain changes with depth, always serving up something different.\n\n-in game help. it is incredibly intuitive. It could be a little more indepth with some items but still very well thought out and just a blessing.\n\n-holobase function. you can track realtime how your network is functioning and where any bottlenecks are\n\n-good steam community who have most answers for you.\n\n-developer that is active on forums and takes interest in our feedback.\n\ncons\n\n-there is no way to pause the game as yet. you can camp out next to a torch or leave and come back (which is not that big of a deal due to fast load times) but pause would be awesome when you have the mrs trying to talk to you or a baby screaming at you. I understand the dev has said that it is a survival game but it could be a deal breaker for some gamers.\n\n-controls take a while to get used to. now and again im still trying to access hoppers with e.\n\n-the options could be a little more in depth with the sounds and music. took  google to find out how to turn off music (ctrl -m)\n\n-a coordinate system would make digging holes to your mining operations soo much easier.\n\nall in all a great early access game. very well thought out and designed. a clear development roadmap and it gives you what it promises. anyway back to the mrs tasks","January 24","true","32.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Unless you are grossly incompetent, you won't lose the game, and there is no feeling of dread that you are in deep doo doo and might lose.\n\nI do recommend the game and I do find it fun, but after awhile you realize you have reached a point where you have so many resources, you just don't have to worry about nothing and the challenge is all gone.\n\nWhat the game needs is random events of some type that force you to cope with the unpredictable, or some sort of boss creature that attacks once in a while and might destroy parts of your base.","February 28","true","118.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game MAY be blocky as minecraft, but the textures are detailed, and pretty, with out them being blocks. They do have blocky hit box, but hitboxes aren't that important ;). So beck to the topic. You can build BIG mining operations, and factories, and what not, on pretty much anything. Because of the worlds size that is 200 LIGHT YEARS (or 1892146155423912000 meters !) long in every direction from spawn, you can build what ever. It's kind of hard and challenging to start up, but when you get a bit automated, you are all good (and challenges are fun, right?).\n\nNow lets talk about mining. You get an ore extractor, that mines ore veins. Each ore vein is different in size. Some can be up to 32 mil. ore!. That is going to last a very long while. But to do that you need to send power down, and then with conveyors, pipes, ore matter movers, up to the surface and smelt it.\n\nGoal in this game (right now) is to kill 4 overminds, with orbital strike. Now there is at least 100h of gameplay. But this is not like factorio (I still love Factorio tho), that you win, and not play anymore. If you win here, you can still do stuff! But if you kill them, nothing will attack you (for now)\n\nNow about updates and performance. Well, updates are often, and also you have different "betas" to play on, like Bleeding Edge. That is game where is new stuff, that will be put into mainline. But this comes at the risk. You can crash, your world can get corrupted, and bugs. Well, that is why its called "Bleeding" edge ;). Preformance is pretty decent. I have 8GB, and this game is in Unity 5, and I use only 40% of memory. FPS are very high, but if you request too much FPS, your world may not load fast.\n\nNow final part, the devs. As far as I know. There is one Developer working on this game, DjArcas. He has few other devs to help out. Also he streams on Twitch like 8h STRAIGHT! He shows all the programming, and how he works the game. Also, because Direwolf20 have played this, more people came in :D. But I don't think that DJ is getting enough $$$, for what is he doing. He indeed deserves more. You know, he needs food, and personal things. Also you know how models of blocks can cost?! Up to 10k$! those are some big bucks. But this means, more people = faster game development.\n\nSo from this review, you can tell that I LOVE this game. This is legit, the nicest comunity, that I ever met. You need help with Game? just post a thread, and people will anwser :). Lots of nice people, and if the thread is something big (sometimes even small), even developers themselves will help you! Actually, they are on 80% of the threads, so that speaks for it self :).\n\nThanks all! Keep it up!\n\n\n","March 11","true","118.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Fairly mindless block bashing, slightly complex resource management, dumb mobs. Pretty too.\n\nMy biggest issue is not being able to see what is inside your storage hoppers when there is more than one item in there, they don't act like chests as in being able to open them and view what's inside, but more like stacks, where you can only tell how many items are in the stack and only see the top one.\n\nAnother is the spiderbot, which is supposed to defend your base, however it is a rubbish shot, and it spends its time getting in your way or damaging the terrain around and under your base making it difficult to move around. Need a way to switch it off or disable it.\n\nEDIT: Recent update made the Spiderbot better. No weapons at the start, upgradeable weapons thereafter and they've apparently made it a much better shot with the ability to target up to 5 mobs simultaneously.
