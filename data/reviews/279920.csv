The game keeps throwing you into interesting set piece moments and new obstacles to keep you on your toes. The game is set in the first person perspective and that helps the player get a good sense of the game's speed.\n\nThe graphics aren't bad, but they do look dated, comparible to the end of the PS2 era.

It's streangely addictive, and the set peice moments of the game are quite exhilarating.\n\nPros:\n- Addictive game play\n- Set peice moments are exhilarating\n- Story is suprisingly well fleshed out\n- Lots of features to explore\n\nCons:\n- Dated graphics\n- QTE combat\n- Might be too simple for some","July 14, 2014","true","5.9"," 70 of 96 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","70","96","2","5"

It’s a game about a prisoner trapped inside a massive spaceship who is suddenly freed one day and seeks to make a run for it. However, this isn’t your everyday criminal — he’s also a werewolf. Yes, it’s patently ridiculous but also kind of cool. How does this runner stand up in comparison with the rest of the genre? In Infinity Runner, players are given a first-person perspective. Everything is seen from the eyes of the prisoner/werewolf sometimes including his naked arms and legs. Still, the basic mechanics of a platformer come into play. Timing is paramount to staying alive, as one wrong move will see you toasted by lasers, falling into the dark void of space, or worse.According to the plot, spaceship Infinity is the largest ever built. Yet there’s not a ton of variety amongst the seven different sections. Each section contains two levels within it and they regularly boil down to incredibly dark, tight hallways. They’re all interspersed with traps that will either sap bits of health or offer a one-hit kill. Every trap has a trick or two for successfully avoiding it. This might include jumping, sliding, running left or right, or combining actions to stay safe. Infinity Runner starts off by explaining how to handle new obstacles, but a couple are never explained which leads to a little trial and error.Mainly it is facing actual enemies that tweaks the formula. Stopping them revolves around Quick Time Events which seem semi-randomized. Thankfully, you’re given some breathing room in regards to how long you have to enter a combination. Get one thing wrong and you’ll be sent back to the checkpoint. A slight change to this formula comes when in werewolf mode as it is nearly indestructible. As a werewolf, enemies no longer pose a threat and are automatically taken care of. A handful of modes are included, although none particularly change up the formula. Story mode provides players with a narrative while running through levels while arcade mode challenges them to get the best score. Multiplayer mode is much the same, except that multiple people can play at once. None of them are actually seen, though, so it’s mostly asynchronous fights for leaderboard supremacy.Beyond the werewolf and first-person perspective concepts, there’s not too much that makes it stand out. Visuals are serviceable, but never get a chance to shine thanks to copious hallway scenes. One special feature is that Infinity Runner can be played with an Oculus Rift. I can’t speak of how the game runs from that perspective without owning the device.Infinity Runner has a fun, unique concept that isn’t utilized to the fullest. Dodging obstacles would be more rewarding if the difficulty ramped up alongside story mode. Instead, it reaches a certain level and stays there depending on the initial difficulty selected. There’s simply no urge to keep playing if skill isn’t being tested. The droll sci-fi storyline only goes so far and its runner mechanics have been done better before. Owning an Oculus Rift is the main reason to buy it, as the device is currently lacking in platformers. Still, there are likely better-than-average titles right around the corner.Overall 5/10.","February 23, 2015","true","7.6"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","31","36","0","1"

It's pretty fun, and addictive enough that I completed the story mode in one go and then played through the hard and arcade modes until some real-life errands dragged me away. Normally for a game this short I'd say the price is a bit high, but it's a game based around being fast, so. It also has to be commended for having a silly premise but making it work by playing it straight; way too many games start with a wacky idea and then constantly push it with zany humour until you're sick of the entire thing.\n\nThe flaws obviously weren't enough to stop me playing, but they're worth noting: I don't think a game like this really needs a lives system, it would probably be enough just to dock your score when you die. There were a few rare instances where I failed to dodge an obstacle and kind of just clipped through it instead, which was helpful but probably something that might need fixing. The biggest flaw for me was that the voice actor (there's really only one with a speaking role) runs through her lines faster than a werewolf through a spaceship. Better voice direction would really have helped there, towards the end I was beginning to suspect they'd shot the cutscenes before they recorded the dialogue and panicked when they realised they weren't long enough to get out what little plot the game has.","August 6, 2014","true","4.2"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

The game handles running on your behalf, so you just need to avoid obstacles and go around corners. This is a lot harder than it sounds. I think it interesting that some people compared this to Temple Run. Yes its somewhat similar, but this feels much more like an old school arcade game to me.  The difficulty curve is pretty steep, your first few runs will probably end with you running into a wall. However once you’ve got to grips with the controls it becomes a lot more rewarding.  Nailing a difficult section with the soundtrack pumping makes you feel like a boss.\n\nThe pace of the game is FAST, you really have to concentrate at all times. I don’t normally  like QTE’s but here they break up the gameplay nicely and let you relax, albeit just for a few seconds.\nGraphics are pretty good especially the parts where you transition outdoors. I’m able to play it on max settings on my laptop which is a nice surprise.\n\nHaven’t had a chance to play multiplayer yet but it sounds interesting.\nAll in all this is a good game in a niche genre.

I can however rate it on its gameplay.\n\nI find Infinity runner is a game best entered with few expectations. It promises pretty much what you think it does. Its a first person action running simulator.\nThat said, its an on rails obstical course with an interesting twist. The werewolves in space theme allows you to turn into a hulking werewolf mid-run, and change many of the rules in your favor, as it should. The combat in the game (yes, it has combat) is in the form of QTEs depending on the position and number of enemies in a room. If you succeed the challenge, you are rewarded with a smash and kill style fight as your avatar kills everyone in the room and continues to run at break neck speeds.\nYes, you are running at break neck speeds as any failure to react correctly to the environment as it explodes around you is an instant death. Thankfully you as a player are barely penalised, as you are almost immediately put back into sonic speeds at revival.\nI rate this game highly because I believe it accomplised its goal almost entirely. I found myself glued to the screen, not trying to contemplate what was going on in the world, but instead reacting to my immediate environment. Each level brings its own style of obsticals, from literally jumping through space to sliding under gunships as they lay fire down on my naked body.\n\nI wouldn't play this game for the lore, but why would you? This is a game meant to be played for about 20 minutes at a time, and is very satisfying as that.

It is still fun to play, its just not what I thought it would be.\nThe story takes place inside a ship called the Infinity, you wake up and have to escape by running down very long and dark tunnels and avoiding traps and fighting enemies. There is only a few times when you are actually in an enviroment where you can see around you. Which was dissapointing to me considering the store page listed it with "Stunning Graphics", I have yet to really see anything stunning. The graphics are decent enough though, they aren't terrible or anything. Most the time you're running too fast to notice any textures on the sides of you anyways. I ran it at max settings and it never dropped below 80-fps. There are quite a bit of video settings in the options menu too so anyone with a low end PC should be fine to run this, but as always check the system requirements first.\nAs far as playability goes, like I said before its kinda repetitive. You're stuck inside dark tunnels of this ship for most the game until the last area where you are in some biosphere which is still pretty dark and not much real scenery. You have to dodge obstacles and fight enemies using button sequences displayed on the screen which, I was hoping for a more hands on feel with the fighting like mirrors edge. The obstacles can be challenging at times though which i think is the best part of the game, I believe they are randomly generated so you never really know what to expect around the next corner. It could be several traps one after another or just empty long boring hallways. You also get to become a Warewolf at certain points\nwhich I didnt really understand and it makes it twice as hard to see. There are a few modes to choose from including Story, Arcade and Multiplayer, I have yet to experience the Multiplayer tho because no one is ever hosting. I attempted to host to see what it was like but no one ever joined so Multiplayer is dead from the start, I think the leaderboards serve a better purpose. Arcade mode allows you to play any level for time, score, or distance and is all randomly generated, and Story is just that, a story, and the map isn't random. So if you die, youll experience the same trap or enemies until you pass them and get to the next chekpoint.\nThe game is also supposed to be oculus supported but since I don't own one I don't know much about this part. I did however decide to read up on it a bit and apparently there is a huge fear of motion sickness in this game since there are scenes where you lose control of the player and the game takes over. I have heard that it can cause a lot of people to get headaches and sick and is even listed as a bad idea in the "Things NOT to do" Oculus dev guide. I thought it may seem like a good idea to play a game like this in VR at first but most people are saying no.\nAs far as the controls, They are very simple. Youre character runs by itself so there is no need to move yourself forward, You will only have to strafe left or right or jump or slide to dodge the obstacles. Fighting enemies requires that you follow a button sequence displayed on screen which is always a combitnation of the same keys just in a different order.\nI haven't had any crashes with the game or errors from what I have played and I've played every level.\nNow wether I recommend this game or not, Im still on the fence about it. It's fun to play for about 20 min but I personally get bored with it very quickly. If you like a challenge and you like running games it may be for you. The price tag runs at $10 and Im not sure its really worth that considering Multiplayer is dead from the start and the levels are really dark and mostly tunnels. I know its a space ship but I would have hoped for better lighting at least.\nAll in All im gonna rate it at a 6/10. Hopefully the next game to come out like this will be on a planet or somewhere with some actual scenery and lighting.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3v2EDNP8C0","July 17, 2014","false","2.7"," 28 of 46 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","28","46","0","1"

There's a bit of a story but it's pretty sparse and really an excuse to get to the running. Overall I found the running really fun. The backdrops are all pretty interesting in a sort of pulp sci-fi way (though sometimes on your first run it's hard to tell how to navigate some of the obstacles).\n\nThere is a lives system where you can die a certain amount of times and go back to a previous checkpoint rather than having to restart. The lives system seemed a bit unnecessary and I think I would have preferred (at least for story mode) to have infinite lives and just go back to the last checkpoint every time and maybe lose some points or something. Combat is executed by QTEs and the final boss fight killed me enough times that I had to restart the level a few times and that was a bit irritating.\n\nRunning feels great and navigating obstacles without losing momentum is super fun, but the mouse/keyboard controls can be a bit awkward. The game might feel a bit smoother with a controller.\n\nThe arcade mode is a true endless runner where you run through the different sections of the ship until you run out of lives, and I think that's where the game really shines. In arcade mode you can choose to turn combat off if you'd prefer to not have to deal with the QTEs.\n\nThere is a multiplayer mode of some kind but I didn't try it so I don't have an opinion on it.","July 24, 2015","true","6.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

However, I noticed some things that I just could not brush off. For instance, after you have completed the first two sectors, your female friend in the game no longer follows along with the words that are being spoken by the voice actress. Its like she has mind of her own and it is telling her not to open her mouth. Also, there's not alot of ways to take down an oppenent. I don't expect the werewolf form to have many ways to take down an enemy (due to the fact a werewolf is a raging beast) but, I do wish the human form had more fighting styles since your main character was trained to be a deadly living weapon. The story is okay. Not the best story ever told but it does fill in the gaps (most of them anyway). The final issue I have with this game, and is also the biggest issue, is the controller support. I see most games give you more options in order to change the button layout to your own comfort level and they don't mix and match buttons in order to keep throwing you off, but that is all you ever see when you play Infinity Runner. For instance, you are given three configuration choices depending on your controller and what you feel most comfortable with: one for ps3, one for xbox, and one that is custom. The issue starts when you are in a fighting sequence against the guard when it tells you to press the press the A button, it actually means that you have to press the RB button. What!? The layout for the buttons is scattered all over thet place! When you press X, it actually means Y. When you press LT, it actually mean the start button. This was so unbearable that I had to stick with the playstation configuration becuase most of the buttons were in the right order. The only two buttons that switched places was R2 and R1, as well as L2 and L1. This was the most frustrating part of the entire game. Overall, my final verdict for this game is a 7/10. Infinity Runner is a over the top, sci-fi based, parkour simulator that has fast paced gameplay that will leave gamers wanting more of the adrenaline rush. But, there are also a ton of other issues that need to fixed right away. Otherwise this franchise will NOT reach it's full potential.","January 10, 2015","true","3.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

I've never really been attracted to the whole 'runner' style of game as it seems repetitive and dull but Infinity Runner smashes those clichés and really grabs you right from the off.\n\nYour main objective is to run down a spaceship in an attempt to escape. Sounds simple but man is it frustrating. The game slowly introduces new aspects and mechanics, which keep it fresh and enjoyable, QTE sequences, that you will be praying for more of and then it throws in a werewolf for good measure. A werewolf in space! Why wouldn’t you be interested?\n\nThe games aesthetics are really beautiful and the quality of the animations and voice acting are remarkable. The soundtrack is fantastic, especially when you’re running at that speed, and so making a massive jump or avoiding deadly lasers really makes you feel like a boss.\n\nA really enjoyable game for a good price and I will definitely be recommending it.

I could understand disdain for this if it were endless, or if there were exploitative microtransactions. This game has neither. It has a level structure, and it even has difficulty settings which affect the game in very interesting ways. Also: It's a bloody werewolf on a spaceship, you miserable old sadsack. What more could you ask for?\n\nTo throw some more details into this ball of words than that -- it's similar to endless runners on the tablets, except not at all. The level structure and controls (which feel rad) make it feel very different, it's more 'inspired by.' So the end result is a game that has more in common with SkyRoads and '90s PC shareware games than it does Temple Runner. That's not a bad thing, since Temple Runner and its ilk are 'pay to keep going' games. This is a 'be good enough to keep going' game. And if you're simply awful at it, well there's an easy mode for you, too (as I mentioned!).\n\nI don't know what there is to dislike about this, really. It's aesthetically pretty, it's fun to kill a few minutes with (when you don't have much time to spare), and it's priced accordingly. I can't understand why you'd hate this other than perhaps a.) you're young and your money is limited so you want your games to last longer and thus you're very invested in the fallacy of quantity -> quality (you'll learn), or b.) you're xenophobic and you hate Welsh people and werewolves??

The music also is probably some of the worst music I’ve listened to in a video game in a long time; bland and forgettable techno music\n- Unfortunately the graphics also are subpar at best. The textures on the environments are low quality and muddy, and the 3D models are also pretty poor; topped off with the repeated sections of the corridors you run through simply being uninteresting as well leaves much to be desired in the graphical department\n- Even at its short length (1 ½ hours on Normal difficulty), the game still does manage to be pretty repetitive. You will see the same gameplay sections (with the exact same QTEs as well) many times throughout the game; having a bigger variety in the sections or more levels would’ve been welcome.\n\n\nVerdict\n“While the game is very short and has little to no story, the focus on gameplay makes the game--at the very least--fun. I bought this game for about £2 and I feel I got my money’s worth, but I don’t really think it’s worth much more than that. Considering how few infinite runner-style games there are on the market at the moment, this one is at least acceptable in terms of quality and enjoyment.”\n\n6/10 TJBs","February 19, 2015","true","3.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xriah/recommended/279920/","Xriah","Xriah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xriah/","502 products in account","Utter disappointment.\n\nThe game concept is pretty easy to get a grasp of. Automatically run down a corridor dodging obstacles by hitting buttons at the right time. Left and Right to dodge left and right, click to jump, right click to slide, look left or right to turn down a corridor. Sounds simple enough in theory, right?\n\nYou'll quickly begin to notice problems when the environment starts falling apart on you. While the asthetics are cool to look at, the different chatoic elements often leave you with no way to reasonably discern what button to hit until it's too late. It turns the game from a fun, adrenaline fueled thrill ride into a frusturating chore of trial and error.\n\nThe particular bit that sticks out in my mind was where you ripline past two droids that are firing at you. The second droid gets in your way, and you have to drop off the ripline and slide under it. However, you can't slide until you've hit the ground, and it's really hard to tell when you've hit the ground in this game because of your extreme forward momentum and the first person perspective. It took several tries to figure out what percise moment to hit the button, again through trial and error.\n\nThis combines with controls that just aren't responsive enough. I have a pretty good gaming PC, and I turned my quality way down, and it still felt like their was a slight delay on every button press. It wouldn't be so bad if you wern't going so fast.\n\nAnother person might be able to look past these flaws and get immersed in the experience. For me, the above issues consistently ruined my immersion. If you want a good runner game, check out TEC 3001. Aside form the simpler graphics, it does everything this game does 10x better.","July 15, 2014","false","0.5"," 23 of 41 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","23","41","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frogmstr/recommended/279920/","frogmstr","frogmstr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frogmstr/","523 products in account","I really wanted to enjoy this game. It has huge potential but fails in almost every basic aspect of the gameplay. The core mechanics is simply a fast reaction game. You see an obstacle - you need to press a specific button. If you fails, you run from the checkpoint. 4 fails and you need to restart the whole level. Simple as that. The problem is, the obstacles are pretty much never recognizable. Eventually every time I saw a new obstacle I needed to die few times just to learn how to dodge it. After I knew it, it never was a challange anymore. This is another problem: when you go out of lives on a new hurdle, you need to replay the whole section which is a sea of boredom now, when you know handle it.\nBut, with all the things above, it would be a moderatly fine game, the controls are well responsive, the visuals create a really tense atmosphere, I had moments of enjoyment.\nThe real killers are QTE scenes. I tell you, it's the worst implemented QTE I ever saw in a game. And I saw quite a lot of bad QTEs. Let's give an example: in the middle of the run you see something on the left. If you think that it's obstacle and press right - well your bad, the key was right mouse button - restart! Eventually on the second try you wait with clicking anything, and, eventually, you see the right mouse button sprite. Awesome, you click it. Now you have a second to press next button - "A" is displayed. Wait, "A"? It will be backward, no!... Too late, restart! Not to mention, the whole UI for it is terribly unreadable, you have a second to press a button, yet you need some time to find the new button on the screen and then to process, if "D" means left, or maybe right... (I know it may sounds silly but believe me, in a span of the second, it's really hard to process those things, and it's super annoying since it's the mere core of the gameplay)\nTo write anything about other aspects of the game: The story is not engaging, not at all, it lacks any strong characters or plot, sounds are very annoying, however I really like the music and the mood overall. Sadly, due to those great flaws mentioned, I really can't honestly recommend this title.","March 31, 2015","false","3.9"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

The gameplay consists of a string of quick time events. But it is really cool so far. What can I say? It has Werewolves! in SPACE!!\n\n(optional let's play footage) lol we all posted videos, guess I get the leftover view right? =D\nhttp://youtu.be/2alrnFP6HME\nTip; as soon you boot up the game for the first time rebind jump to space and slide to Ctrl or your preferred FPS crouching key. You might find that you die a lot less from pressing the wrong button this way. They made some weird choices for some of the default key bindings.\n\nOkay funniest thing, if you don't look left or right to turn at corners your character will run straight into the wall 'THWACK!' and your dead lol. Yes you lose a life and have to go back to the last checkpoint. But the fact that you can kill yourself by stupidly running into walls is pretty amusing.\n\nYes the game has repetitive elements e.g. the same looking obstacles multiple times. However I think the pacing makes up for this. The player character is constantly running and only stops at the end of a stage or to take down enemies in quick time animations. The game definitely can become frustrating. You make the right action to avoid obstacles i.e. some can only be slid under while others you must leap over. If you accidentally jump for example when you should have slid you can't undo that action and you hit the obstacle. A lot of the obstacles are insta-death. I chewed through my lives dying repeatedly at the same spot and had to restart stages from the beginning several times. But I wouldn't go as far as to say that the game is unfair. You just need to think fast. And if you want you can change the difficulty to easy if you wish (I didn't try that though). It would be nice if the game paused when it gives you tutorial tips because by time I processed them it was too late and I died in the obstacle. Lastly it was exciting when I first transformed into a werewolf.\n\nThe graphics aren't 'AAA' standard but the game looks good. I liked the music. The dialogue from the holo-chick or whatever she is got a little bit annoying at times especially when you hear the same thing again and again because you have to repeat a stage several times. But surprisingly I later found that some of the dialogue was actually funny (intentionally).\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","July 14, 2014","true","0.8"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","0"

Unskippable cutscenes and just tedious to play in general. It's as if you have to remember what to do everytime you die and not re-do it the next time around in order to succeed (for the story mode, anyways).\n\nThe sadest thing is that the voice acting is not so bad, but the way her voices comes in, the amount of feedback and distortion in her voice, most of the time it just hurts my ears or I can't really understand what she's trying to say.\n\nMost obtacles are trial and error, because it's not quite clear what is needed to do.

Heck, with that being said, I have to wonder if any of this game was play-tested. In conclusion to my rambling about this hot mess, I expect better from a free iOS/Android app, whereas this game costs $10. If I had payed this much and not gotten it from a cheap bundle, I can't imagine how awful I would feel.","February 22, 2015","false","3.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","1"

Twice the female character is about to reveal some major plot twist and twice she gets cut off, the game slapping a "TO BE CONTINUED" in your face at the last moment. Pointless.\nMusic is kind of awful, especially in the Docks area. Aural assault. Awful.\nOccasional lag issues.\nMultiplayer is non-existent basically, yet required for a few achievements.\n\nMajor complaints:\nThe entire game is trial-and-error based. Lots of stuff that you have basically no reaction time to see coming, lots of rooms with non-obvious solutions that you have to throw corpses at until you pass. Also, you have limited lives. And the levels are all several minutes long.\n\nBasically, no. That is inherently bad game design. There was no salvaging it at that point. The limited lives and abundance of "gotcha" moments are the only challenge this game provides though; except when the controls don't work (I've had slides and jumps fail numerous times). There's no difficulty here that feels like real difficulty, just fake difficulty that makes it unpleasant to play.\n\nA lot of things aren't graphically distinguishable either; in some areas it's near-impossible to tell which direction to turn until a fraction of a second before you need to turn. The falling sections of the game have mines in them which are practically impossible to see on the black backdrop of the section, too.\n\nAnd did I mention the game is repetitive as all hell? There are 4 times in the game where you run through a bonus area that is ALWAYS exactly the same. There are 3 times where you skydive through a section that is ALWAYS exactly the same. Every wolf section is basically a minute-long cutscene as there's only one way to die and once you figure out how to wall-run (which is, naturally, presented wrong; it shows mouse click and then holding A/D but you're supposed to press them the other way around, nice job there...) there's no challenge to it. There's almost no new obstacles presented past the third world aside from some badly-designed "figure out the sequence" rooms that tend to be non-obvious more often than not. There's a QTE boss at the very end of the game (which is... not very good). And that's basically it.\n\nThere's a smaaall bit of fun to be had with this initially but it wears off quickly and the problems with the game show through pretty quick, too.

Input lag is the first you'll run into and is prevelant through out the game, but once you're aware of it you can play around it. More seriously is in the later levels the FPS drops nearly into the single digits in some sections. This should not happen in a game that looks like its from mid-way through the PS2 era using a newer computer (less than a year old.) The framerate dorp mixed with the input lag makes the later stage diffficult and frustrating in the extreme to complete. Furthermore, I've had issues with falling through the level and running through obstacles but not taking damage or dying in the last few stages.\n\nEdit: Also found an encounter on the last level that is literally impossible to get past at current framerates (even with everything set to lowest settings.) A guard will de-cloak right on top of you, killing you before you can re-act to any prompt. I even jump past him on one encounter, but the game dragged me back to the spot and killed me instantly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/279920/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","This game just doesn't have it. Bad premise, gameplay, structure. The entire game you have no control, it's just somehow believable that you are on some ship and spend the entire time running around endless corridors and attack guards in the same way. I know if I was trying to do something I wouldn't be running as fast as possible endlessly through corridors.....how believable is that? The endless running doesn't even work. Every corridor and level looks and feels the same. Combat is boring, you hit WASD and click the mouse, although the buttons aren't even on the right corresponding spot on the screen, W which corrisponds to the top of the three buttons will be on the buttom right of the screen and A which is on the left will be after W on the top of the screen, not well done. Every fight you do the same thing, either attack 1 guy witht he same button cues or attack a group of three guys the same way with the same button cues. I guess the only way the game couldn't suck as much as it does is if it serves as an oculus rift demo game.\n\nThe jumping and sliding are stupidly programmed to right and left mouse click, which don't make sense and aren't intuitive, compared to space and C/ctrl, meaning when you have to decide to jump or slide last second, you have to think and remember every time, which is which, which leads to death due to poor game design. The jumping and sliding don't even work well. When you jump you are in the air for super long. I would jump something and by the time I finally landed I would be at the next spot to do something or it would already be too late to do something because the jump was unnecessarily long. Since jumping and sliding last forever, this means you have to actually do them way before it makes sense to, or you would do it any fps or platform game. Turning corners is done stupidly as well, as you move your mouse to the apparent side, instead of right and left buttons like A/D. This leads to you moving the mouse and it not counting because you didn't move it enough, or any other problems that makes it finnickier than it needs to be. You onyl get 3 lives per long running level, and if you die you have to restart everything all over again, which encourages repetition and pads game length, a dump idea. There are these cards but they basically do nothing, it makes it almost impossible to get an extra life from them, they should have made it easier or make more sense, so you have a point to collecting them. The game also doesn't use obstacles right. At certain points something like an explosion would happen after another one, but it wouldn't happen until I was already at it, and it would hit me from the side before I could react. The only way to beat this is to repeat it and know its coming to dodge it. How terrible for an endless runner to just auto kill you until you remember to make a movement before the cue is on the screen and give you enough time to do it.....that's their only job. At other parts, you don't know what movement to make. Certain times fire or smoke or some random thing you haven't seen will pop up and they for some reason don't make it apparent what you should do, meaning you have to take a random guess or die. This happened 2 times back to make, meaning I died and lost all my 5 min of running at that level. This means I had to restart the game from the start of the entire level because the game decided to spring instant death gambles on me. How could they screw up the basic ideas of a runner game. Not really much positive to speak of unfortunately. Multiplayer is 100% dead and arcade is just replaying the same levels. The game is boring, they mechanics aren't done well, and gameplay is flawed.

It’s a game about a prisoner trapped inside a massive spaceship who is suddenly freed one day and seeks to make a run for it. However, this isn’t your everyday criminal — he’s also a werewolf. Yes, it’s patently ridiculous but also kind of cool. How does this runner stand up in comparison with the rest of the genre? In Infinity Runner, players are given a first-person perspective. Everything is seen from the eyes of the prisoner/werewolf sometimes including his naked arms and legs. Still, the basic mechanics of a platformer come into play. Timing is paramount to staying alive, as one wrong move will see you toasted by lasers, falling into the dark void of space, or worse.According to the plot, spaceship Infinity is the largest ever built. Yet there’s not a ton of variety amongst the seven different sections. Each section contains two levels within it and they regularly boil down to incredibly dark, tight hallways. They’re all interspersed with traps that will either sap bits of health or offer a one-hit kill. Every trap has a trick or two for successfully avoiding it. This might include jumping, sliding, running left or right, or combining actions to stay safe. Infinity Runner starts off by explaining how to handle new obstacles, but a couple are never explained which leads to a little trial and error.Mainly it is facing actual enemies that tweaks the formula. Stopping them revolves around Quick Time Events which seem semi-randomized. Thankfully, you’re given some breathing room in regards to how long you have to enter a combination. Get one thing wrong and you’ll be sent back to the checkpoint. A slight change to this formula comes when in werewolf mode as it is nearly indestructible. As a werewolf, enemies no longer pose a threat and are automatically taken care of. A handful of modes are included, although none particularly change up the formula. Story mode provides players with a narrative while running through levels while arcade mode challenges them to get the best score. Multiplayer mode is much the same, except that multiple people can play at once. None of them are actually seen, though, so it’s mostly asynchronous fights for leaderboard supremacy.Beyond the werewolf and first-person perspective concepts, there’s not too much that makes it stand out. Visuals are serviceable, but never get a chance to shine thanks to copious hallway scenes. One special feature is that Infinity Runner can be played with an Oculus Rift. I can’t speak of how the game runs from that perspective without owning the device.Infinity Runner has a fun, unique concept that isn’t utilized to the fullest. Dodging obstacles would be more rewarding if the difficulty ramped up alongside story mode. Instead, it reaches a certain level and stays there depending on the initial difficulty selected. There’s simply no urge to keep playing if skill isn’t being tested. The droll sci-fi storyline only goes so far and its runner mechanics have been done better before. Owning an Oculus Rift is the main reason to buy it, as the device is currently lacking in platformers. Still, there are likely better-than-average titles right around the corner.Overall 5/10.","February 23, 2015","true","7.6"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","31","36","0","1"

It's pretty fun, and addictive enough that I completed the story mode in one go and then played through the hard and arcade modes until some real-life errands dragged me away. Normally for a game this short I'd say the price is a bit high, but it's a game based around being fast, so. It also has to be commended for having a silly premise but making it work by playing it straight; way too many games start with a wacky idea and then constantly push it with zany humour until you're sick of the entire thing.\n\nThe flaws obviously weren't enough to stop me playing, but they're worth noting: I don't think a game like this really needs a lives system, it would probably be enough just to dock your score when you die. There were a few rare instances where I failed to dodge an obstacle and kind of just clipped through it instead, which was helpful but probably something that might need fixing. The biggest flaw for me was that the voice actor (there's really only one with a speaking role) runs through her lines faster than a werewolf through a spaceship. Better voice direction would really have helped there, towards the end I was beginning to suspect they'd shot the cutscenes before they recorded the dialogue and panicked when they realised they weren't long enough to get out what little plot the game has.","August 6, 2014","true","4.2"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

The game handles running on your behalf, so you just need to avoid obstacles and go around corners. This is a lot harder than it sounds. I think it interesting that some people compared this to Temple Run. Yes its somewhat similar, but this feels much more like an old school arcade game to me.  The difficulty curve is pretty steep, your first few runs will probably end with you running into a wall. However once you’ve got to grips with the controls it becomes a lot more rewarding.  Nailing a difficult section with the soundtrack pumping makes you feel like a boss.\n\nThe pace of the game is FAST, you really have to concentrate at all times. I don’t normally  like QTE’s but here they break up the gameplay nicely and let you relax, albeit just for a few seconds.\nGraphics are pretty good especially the parts where you transition outdoors.

I can however rate it on its gameplay.\n\nI find Infinity runner is a game best entered with few expectations. It promises pretty much what you think it does. Its a first person action running simulator.\nThat said, its an on rails obstical course with an interesting twist. The werewolves in space theme allows you to turn into a hulking werewolf mid-run, and change many of the rules in your favor, as it should. The combat in the game (yes, it has combat) is in the form of QTEs depending on the position and number of enemies in a room. If you succeed the challenge, you are rewarded with a smash and kill style fight as your avatar kills everyone in the room and continues to run at break neck speeds.\nYes, you are running at break neck speeds as any failure to react correctly to the environment as it explodes around you is an instant death. Thankfully you as a player are barely penalised, as you are almost immediately put back into sonic speeds at revival.\nI rate this game highly because I believe it accomplised its goal almost entirely. I found myself glued to the screen, not trying to contemplate what was going on in the world, but instead reacting to my immediate environment. Each level brings its own style of obsticals, from literally jumping through space to sliding under gunships as they lay fire down on my naked body.\n\nI wouldn't play this game for the lore, but why would you? This is a game meant to be played for about 20 minutes at a time, and is very satisfying as that.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/travizty/recommended/279920/","travizty","TraviztY ッ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/travizty/","726 products in account","Infinity Runner is a running game and its fairly similar to Temple Run and games of that sort, But played in First Person.\nI was actually really excited to play this title when I saw it in the coming soon section but after about an hour in the game I started to notice that the whole thing is kind of repetitive and I think I was expecting a little more from this game since it was on PC. It is still fun to play, its just not what I thought it would be.\nThe story takes place inside a ship called the Infinity, you wake up and have to escape by running down very long and dark tunnels and avoiding traps and fighting enemies. There is only a few times when you are actually in an enviroment where you can see around you. Which was dissapointing to me considering the store page listed it with "Stunning Graphics", I have yet to really see anything stunning. The graphics are decent enough though, they aren't terrible or anything. Most the time you're running too fast to notice any textures on the sides of you anyways. I ran it at max settings and it never dropped below 80-fps. There are quite a bit of video settings in the options menu too so anyone with a low end PC should be fine to run this, but as always check the system requirements first.\nAs far as playability goes, like I said before its kinda repetitive. You're stuck inside dark tunnels of this ship for most the game until the last area where you are in some biosphere which is still pretty dark and not much real scenery. You have to dodge obstacles and fight enemies using button sequences displayed on the screen which, I was hoping for a more hands on feel with the fighting like mirrors edge. The obstacles can be challenging at times though which i think is the best part of the game, I believe they are randomly generated so you never really know what to expect around the next corner. It could be several traps one after another or just empty long boring hallways. You also get to become a Warewolf at certain points\nwhich I didnt really understand and it makes it twice as hard to see. There are a few modes to choose from including Story, Arcade and Multiplayer, I have yet to experience the Multiplayer tho because no one is ever hosting. I attempted to host to see what it was like but no one ever joined so Multiplayer is dead from the start, I think the leaderboards serve a better purpose. Arcade mode allows you to play any level for time, score, or distance and is all randomly generated, and Story is just that, a story, and the map isn't random. So if you die, youll experience the same trap or enemies until you pass them and get to the next chekpoint.\nThe game is also supposed to be oculus supported but since I don't own one I don't know much about this part. I did however decide to read up on it a bit and apparently there is a huge fear of motion sickness in this game since there are scenes where you lose control of the player and the game takes over. I have heard that it can cause a lot of people to get headaches and sick and is even listed as a bad idea in the "Things NOT to do" Oculus dev guide. I thought it may seem like a good idea to play a game like this in VR at first but most people are saying no.\nAs far as the controls, They are very simple. Youre character runs by itself so there is no need to move yourself forward, You will only have to strafe left or right or jump or slide to dodge the obstacles. Fighting enemies requires that you follow a button sequence displayed on screen which is always a combitnation of the same keys just in a different order.\nI haven't had any crashes with the game or errors from what I have played and I've played every level.\nNow wether I recommend this game or not, Im still on the fence about it. It's fun to play for about 20 min but I personally get bored with it very quickly. If you like a challenge and you like running games it may be for you. The price tag runs at $10 and Im not sure its really worth that considering Multiplayer is dead from the start and the levels are really dark and mostly tunnels. I know its a space ship but I would have hoped for better lighting at least.\nAll in All im gonna rate it at a 6/10. Hopefully the next game to come out like this will be on a planet or somewhere with some actual scenery and lighting.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3v2EDNP8C0","July 17, 2014","false","2.7"," 28 of 46 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","28","46","0","1"

There's a bit of a story but it's pretty sparse and really an excuse to get to the running. Overall I found the running really fun. The backdrops are all pretty interesting in a sort of pulp sci-fi way (though sometimes on your first run it's hard to tell how to navigate some of the obstacles).\n\nThere is a lives system where you can die a certain amount of times and go back to a previous checkpoint rather than having to restart. The lives system seemed a bit unnecessary and I think I would have preferred (at least for story mode) to have infinite lives and just go back to the last checkpoint every time and maybe lose some points or something. Combat is executed by QTEs and the final boss fight killed me enough times that I had to restart the level a few times and that was a bit irritating.\n\nRunning feels great and navigating obstacles without losing momentum is super fun, but the mouse/keyboard controls can be a bit awkward. The game might feel a bit smoother with a controller.\n\nThe arcade mode is a true endless runner where you run through the different sections of the ship until you run out of lives, and I think that's where the game really shines. In arcade mode you can choose to turn combat off if you'd prefer to not have to deal with the QTEs.\n\nThere is a multiplayer mode of some kind but I didn't try it so I don't have an opinion on it.","July 24, 2015","true","6.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Not to mention the out of the ordinary concept of werewolves in space. I also enjoyed that there was plenty of obstacles to overcome by various methods such as sliding, quick time fighting sequences, jumping, and ziplining in human form and climbing on walls, crushing enemies with ease, and even breaking through walls in werewolf form. However, I noticed some things that I just could not brush off. For instance, after you have completed the first two sectors, your female friend in the game no longer follows along with the words that are being spoken by the voice actress. Its like she has mind of her own and it is telling her not to open her mouth. Also, there's not alot of ways to take down an oppenent. I don't expect the werewolf form to have many ways to take down an enemy (due to the fact a werewolf is a raging beast) but, I do wish the human form had more fighting styles since your main character was trained to be a deadly living weapon. The story is okay. Not the best story ever told but it does fill in the gaps (most of them anyway). The final issue I have with this game, and is also the biggest issue, is the controller support. I see most games give you more options in order to change the button layout to your own comfort level and they don't mix and match buttons in order to keep throwing you off, but that is all you ever see when you play Infinity Runner. For instance, you are given three configuration choices depending on your controller and what you feel most comfortable with: one for ps3, one for xbox, and one that is custom. The issue starts when you are in a fighting sequence against the guard when it tells you to press the press the A button, it actually means that you have to press the RB button. What!? The layout for the buttons is scattered all over thet place! When you press X, it actually means Y. When you press LT, it actually mean the start button. This was so unbearable that I had to stick with the playstation configuration becuase most of the buttons were in the right order. The only two buttons that switched places was R2 and R1, as well as L2 and L1. This was the most frustrating part of the entire game. Overall, my final verdict for this game is a 7/10. Infinity Runner is a over the top, sci-fi based, parkour simulator that has fast paced gameplay that will leave gamers wanting more of the adrenaline rush. But, there are also a ton of other issues that need to fixed right away. Otherwise this franchise will NOT reach it's full potential.","January 10, 2015","true","3.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

The game slowly introduces new aspects and mechanics, which keep it fresh and enjoyable, QTE sequences, that you will be praying for more of and then it throws in a werewolf for good measure. A werewolf in space! Why wouldn’t you be interested?\n\nThe games aesthetics are really beautiful and the quality of the animations and voice acting are remarkable. The soundtrack is fantastic, especially when you’re running at that speed, and so making a massive jump or avoiding deadly lasers really makes you feel like a boss.\n\nA really enjoyable game for a good price and I will definitely be recommending it.

I could understand disdain for this if it were endless, or if there were exploitative microtransactions. This game has neither. It has a level structure, and it even has difficulty settings which affect the game in very interesting ways. Also: It's a bloody werewolf on a spaceship, you miserable old sadsack. What more could you ask for?\n\nTo throw some more details into this ball of words than that -- it's similar to endless runners on the tablets, except not at all. The level structure and controls (which feel rad) make it feel very different, it's more 'inspired by.' So the end result is a game that has more in common with SkyRoads and '90s PC shareware games than it does Temple Runner. That's not a bad thing, since Temple Runner and its ilk are 'pay to keep going' games. This is a 'be good enough to keep going' game. And if you're simply awful at it, well there's an easy mode for you, too (as I mentioned!).\n\nI don't know what there is to dislike about this, really. It's aesthetically pretty, it's fun to kill a few minutes with (when you don't have much time to spare), and it's priced accordingly. I can't understand why you'd hate this other than perhaps a.) you're young and your money is limited so you want your games to last longer and thus you're very invested in the fallacy of quantity -> quality (you'll learn), or b.) you're xenophobic and you hate Welsh people and werewolves??

The music also is probably some of the worst music I’ve listened to in a video game in a long time; bland and forgettable techno music\n- Unfortunately the graphics also are subpar at best. The textures on the environments are low quality and muddy, and the 3D models are also pretty poor; topped off with the repeated sections of the corridors you run through simply being uninteresting as well leaves much to be desired in the graphical department\n- Even at its short length (1 ½ hours on Normal difficulty), the game still does manage to be pretty repetitive. You will see the same gameplay sections (with the exact same QTEs as well) many times throughout the game; having a bigger variety in the sections or more levels would’ve been welcome.\n\n\nVerdict\n“While the game is very short and has little to no story, the focus on gameplay makes the game--at the very least--fun. I bought this game for about £2 and I feel I got my money’s worth, but I don’t really think it’s worth much more than that. Considering how few infinite runner-style games there are on the market at the moment, this one is at least acceptable in terms of quality and enjoyment.”\n\n6/10 TJBs","February 19, 2015","true","3.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Automatically run down a corridor dodging obstacles by hitting buttons at the right time. Left and Right to dodge left and right, click to jump, right click to slide, look left or right to turn down a corridor. Sounds simple enough in theory, right?\n\nYou'll quickly begin to notice problems when the environment starts falling apart on you. While the asthetics are cool to look at, the different chatoic elements often leave you with no way to reasonably discern what button to hit until it's too late. It turns the game from a fun, adrenaline fueled thrill ride into a frusturating chore of trial and error.\n\nThe particular bit that sticks out in my mind was where you ripline past two droids that are firing at you. The second droid gets in your way, and you have to drop off the ripline and slide under it. However, you can't slide until you've hit the ground, and it's really hard to tell when you've hit the ground in this game because of your extreme forward momentum and the first person perspective. It took several tries to figure out what percise moment to hit the button, again through trial and error.\n\nThis combines with controls that just aren't responsive enough. I have a pretty good gaming PC, and I turned my quality way down, and it still felt like their was a slight delay on every button press. It wouldn't be so bad if you wern't going so fast.\n\nAnother person might be able to look past these flaws and get immersed in the experience. For me, the above issues consistently ruined my immersion. If you want a good runner game, check out TEC 3001. Aside form the simpler graphics, it does everything this game does 10x better.","July 15, 2014","false","0.5"," 23 of 41 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","23","41","0","4"

It has huge potential but fails in almost every basic aspect of the gameplay. The core mechanics is simply a fast reaction game. You see an obstacle - you need to press a specific button. If you fails, you run from the checkpoint. 4 fails and you need to restart the whole level. Simple as that. The problem is, the obstacles are pretty much never recognizable. Eventually every time I saw a new obstacle I needed to die few times just to learn how to dodge it. After I knew it, it never was a challange anymore. This is another problem: when you go out of lives on a new hurdle, you need to replay the whole section which is a sea of boredom now, when you know handle it.\nBut, with all the things above, it would be a moderatly fine game, the controls are well responsive, the visuals create a really tense atmosphere, I had moments of enjoyment.\nThe real killers are QTE scenes. I tell you, it's the worst implemented QTE I ever saw in a game. And I saw quite a lot of bad QTEs. Let's give an example: in the middle of the run you see something on the left. If you think that it's obstacle and press right - well your bad, the key was right mouse button - restart! Eventually on the second try you wait with clicking anything, and, eventually, you see the right mouse button sprite. Awesome, you click it. Now you have a second to press next button - "A" is displayed. Wait, "A"? It will be backward, no!... Too late, restart! Not to mention, the whole UI for it is terribly unreadable, you have a second to press a button, yet you need some time to find the new button on the screen and then to process, if "D" means left, or maybe right... (I know it may sounds silly but believe me, in a span of the second, it's really hard to process those things, and it's super annoying since it's the mere core of the gameplay)\nTo write anything about other aspects of the game: The story is not engaging, not at all, it lacks any strong characters or plot, sounds are very annoying, however I really like the music and the mood overall. Sadly, due to those great flaws mentioned, I really can't honestly recommend this title.","March 31, 2015","false","3.9"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

The gameplay consists of a string of quick time events. But it is really cool so far. What can I say? It has Werewolves! in SPACE!!\n\n(optional let's play footage) lol we all posted videos, guess I get the leftover view right? =D\nhttp://youtu.be/2alrnFP6HME\nTip; as soon you boot up the game for the first time rebind jump to space and slide to Ctrl or your preferred FPS crouching key. You might find that you die a lot less from pressing the wrong button this way. They made some weird choices for some of the default key bindings.\n\nOkay funniest thing, if you don't look left or right to turn at corners your character will run straight into the wall 'THWACK!' and your dead lol. Yes you lose a life and have to go back to the last checkpoint. But the fact that you can kill yourself by stupidly running into walls is pretty amusing.\n\nYes the game has repetitive elements e.g. the same looking obstacles multiple times. However I think the pacing makes up for this. The player character is constantly running and only stops at the end of a stage or to take down enemies in quick time animations. The game definitely can become frustrating. You make the right action to avoid obstacles i.e. some can only be slid under while others you must leap over. If you accidentally jump for example when you should have slid you can't undo that action and you hit the obstacle. A lot of the obstacles are insta-death. I chewed through my lives dying repeatedly at the same spot and had to restart stages from the beginning several times. But I wouldn't go as far as to say that the game is unfair. You just need to think fast. And if you want you can change the difficulty to easy if you wish (I didn't try that though). It would be nice if the game paused when it gives you tutorial tips because by time I processed them it was too late and I died in the obstacle. Lastly it was exciting when I first transformed into a werewolf.\n\nThe graphics aren't 'AAA' standard but the game looks good. I liked the music. The dialogue from the holo-chick or whatever she is got a little bit annoying at times especially when you hear the same thing again and again because you have to repeat a stage several times. But surprisingly I later found that some of the dialogue was actually funny (intentionally).\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","July 14, 2014","true","0.8"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","0"

It has oculus rift support and also it obviously has keyboard controls, personally i'm using a keyboard for this review.\n\nThere are alot of bad points to this game: too hard to see most obstacles, tutorial barely lets you time to read the instructions and you're already dead: "Jump!" 0.5 seconds later you fall to your death. Unskippable cutscenes and just tedious to play in general. It's as if you have to remember what to do everytime you die and not re-do it the next time around in order to succeed (for the story mode, anyways).\n\nThe sadest thing is that the voice acting is not so bad, but the way her voices comes in, the amount of feedback and distortion in her voice, most of the time it just hurts my ears or I can't really understand what she's trying to say.\n\nMost obtacles are trial and error, because it's not quite clear what is needed to do. Also so far from the chapters i've played, which have 2 levels each, they reuse the same rooms that the other level had used in the same chapter. There's around 6-7 chapters with 2 levels each I suppose and they manage to reuse the same exact rooms in the same chapter, unbelievable!\n\nThe music is fine and the graphics are fine, but the gameplay is quite bad.

It feels like one of those things that came up in a brainstorming session that sounds interesting, like "hey, why don't we do it in space...with werewolves!" I can't say I'm sure what in the world is going on with the "story". The environments I really have to wonder if there was any play-testing to see how they actually worked. Heck, with that being said, I have to wonder if any of this game was play-tested.

Twice the female character is about to reveal some major plot twist and twice she gets cut off, the game slapping a "TO BE CONTINUED" in your face at the last moment. Pointless.\nMusic is kind of awful, especially in the Docks area. Aural assault. Awful.\nOccasional lag issues.\nMultiplayer is non-existent basically, yet required for a few achievements.\n\nMajor complaints:\nThe entire game is trial-and-error based. Lots of stuff that you have basically no reaction time to see coming, lots of rooms with non-obvious solutions that you have to throw corpses at until you pass. Also, you have limited lives. And the levels are all several minutes long.\n\nBasically, no. That is inherently bad game design. There was no salvaging it at that point. The limited lives and abundance of "gotcha" moments are the only challenge this game provides though; except when the controls don't work (I've had slides and jumps fail numerous times). There's no difficulty here that feels like real difficulty, just fake difficulty that makes it unpleasant to play.\n\nA lot of things aren't graphically distinguishable either; in some areas it's near-impossible to tell which direction to turn until a fraction of a second before you need to turn. The falling sections of the game have mines in them which are practically impossible to see on the black backdrop of the section, too.\n\nAnd did I mention the game is repetitive as all hell? There are 4 times in the game where you run through a bonus area that is ALWAYS exactly the same. There are 3 times where you skydive through a section that is ALWAYS exactly the same. Every wolf section is basically a minute-long cutscene as there's only one way to die and once you figure out how to wall-run (which is, naturally, presented wrong; it shows mouse click and then holding A/D but you're supposed to press them the other way around, nice job there...) there's no challenge to it. There's almost no new obstacles presented past the third world aside from some badly-designed "figure out the sequence" rooms that tend to be non-obvious more often than not. There's a QTE boss at the very end of the game (which is... not very good). And that's basically it.\n\nThere's a smaaall bit of fun to be had with this initially but it wears off quickly and the problems with the game show through pretty quick, too.

Input lag is the first you'll run into and is prevelant through out the game, but once you're aware of it you can play around it. More seriously is in the later levels the FPS drops nearly into the single digits in some sections. This should not happen in a game that looks like its from mid-way through the PS2 era using a newer computer (less than a year old.) The framerate dorp mixed with the input lag makes the later stage diffficult and frustrating in the extreme to complete. Furthermore, I've had issues with falling through the level and running through obstacles but not taking damage or dying in the last few stages.\n\nEdit: Also found an encounter on the last level that is literally impossible to get past at current framerates (even with everything set to lowest settings.) A guard will de-cloak right on top of you, killing you before you can re-act to any prompt. I even jump past him on one encounter, but the game dragged me back to the spot and killed me instantly. As I said, very bugged in the later levels.","September 3, 2014","false","2.2"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/279920/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","This game just doesn't have it. Bad premise, gameplay, structure. The entire game you have no control, it's just somehow believable that you are on some ship and spend the entire time running around endless corridors and attack guards in the same way. I know if I was trying to do something I wouldn't be running as fast as possible endlessly through corridors.....how believable is that? The endless running doesn't even work. Every corridor and level looks and feels the same. Combat is boring, you hit WASD and click the mouse, although the buttons aren't even on the right corresponding spot on the screen, W which corrisponds to the top of the three buttons will be on the buttom right of the screen and A which is on the left will be after W on the top of the screen, not well done. Every fight you do the same thing, either attack 1 guy witht he same button cues or attack a group of three guys the same way with the same button cues. I guess the only way the game couldn't suck as much as it does is if it serves as an oculus rift demo game.\n\nThe jumping and sliding are stupidly programmed to right and left mouse click, which don't make sense and aren't intuitive, compared to space and C/ctrl, meaning when you have to decide to jump or slide last second, you have to think and remember every time, which is which, which leads to death due to poor game design. The jumping and sliding don't even work well. When you jump you are in the air for super long. I would jump something and by the time I finally landed I would be at the next spot to do something or it would already be too late to do something because the jump was unnecessarily long. Since jumping and sliding last forever, this means you have to actually do them way before it makes sense to, or you would do it any fps or platform game. Turning corners is done stupidly as well, as you move your mouse to the apparent side, instead of right and left buttons like A/D. This leads to you moving the mouse and it not counting because you didn't move it enough, or any other problems that makes it finnickier than it needs to be. You onyl get 3 lives per long running level, and if you die you have to restart everything all over again, which encourages repetition and pads game length, a dump idea. There are these cards but they basically do nothing, it makes it almost impossible to get an extra life from them, they should have made it easier or make more sense, so you have a point to collecting them. The game also doesn't use obstacles right. At certain points something like an explosion would happen after another one, but it wouldn't happen until I was already at it, and it would hit me from the side before I could react. The only way to beat this is to repeat it and know its coming to dodge it. How terrible for an endless runner to just auto kill you until you remember to make a movement before the cue is on the screen and give you enough time to do it.....that's their only job. At other parts, you don't know what movement to make. Certain times fire or smoke or some random thing you haven't seen will pop up and they for some reason don't make it apparent what you should do, meaning you have to take a random guess or die. This happened 2 times back to make, meaning I died and lost all my 5 min of running at that level. This means I had to restart the game from the start of the entire level because the game decided to spring instant death gambles on me. How could they screw up the basic ideas of a runner game. Not really much positive to speak of unfortunately. Multiplayer is 100% dead and arcade is just replaying the same levels. The game is boring, they mechanics aren't done well, and gameplay is flawed.

It’s a game about a prisoner trapped inside a massive spaceship who is suddenly freed one day and seeks to make a run for it. However, this isn’t your everyday criminal — he’s also a werewolf. Yes, it’s patently ridiculous but also kind of cool. How does this runner stand up in comparison with the rest of the genre? In Infinity Runner, players are given a first-person perspective. Everything is seen from the eyes of the prisoner/werewolf sometimes including his naked arms and legs. Still, the basic mechanics of a platformer come into play. Timing is paramount to staying alive, as one wrong move will see you toasted by lasers, falling into the dark void of space, or worse.According to the plot, spaceship Infinity is the largest ever built. Yet there’s not a ton of variety amongst the seven different sections. Each section contains two levels within it and they regularly boil down to incredibly dark, tight hallways. They’re all interspersed with traps that will either sap bits of health or offer a one-hit kill. Every trap has a trick or two for successfully avoiding it. This might include jumping, sliding, running left or right, or combining actions to stay safe. Infinity Runner starts off by explaining how to handle new obstacles, but a couple are never explained which leads to a little trial and error.Mainly it is facing actual enemies that tweaks the formula. Stopping them revolves around Quick Time Events which seem semi-randomized. Thankfully, you’re given some breathing room in regards to how long you have to enter a combination. Get one thing wrong and you’ll be sent back to the checkpoint. A slight change to this formula comes when in werewolf mode as it is nearly indestructible. As a werewolf, enemies no longer pose a threat and are automatically taken care of. A handful of modes are included, although none particularly change up the formula. Story mode provides players with a narrative while running through levels while arcade mode challenges them to get the best score. Multiplayer mode is much the same, except that multiple people can play at once. None of them are actually seen, though, so it’s mostly asynchronous fights for leaderboard supremacy.Beyond the werewolf and first-person perspective concepts, there’s not too much that makes it stand out. Visuals are serviceable, but never get a chance to shine thanks to copious hallway scenes. One special feature is that Infinity Runner can be played with an Oculus Rift. I can’t speak of how the game runs from that perspective without owning the device.Infinity Runner has a fun, unique concept that isn’t utilized to the fullest. Dodging obstacles would be more rewarding if the difficulty ramped up alongside story mode. Instead, it reaches a certain level and stays there depending on the initial difficulty selected. There’s simply no urge to keep playing if skill isn’t being tested. The droll sci-fi storyline only goes so far and its runner mechanics have been done better before. Owning an Oculus Rift is the main reason to buy it, as the device is currently lacking in platformers. Still, there are likely better-than-average titles right around the corner.Overall 5/10.","February 23, 2015","true","7.6"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","31","36","0","1"

It's pretty fun, and addictive enough that I completed the story mode in one go and then played through the hard and arcade modes until some real-life errands dragged me away. Normally for a game this short I'd say the price is a bit high, but it's a game based around being fast, so. It also has to be commended for having a silly premise but making it work by playing it straight; way too many games start with a wacky idea and then constantly push it with zany humour until you're sick of the entire thing.\n\nThe flaws obviously weren't enough to stop me playing, but they're worth noting: I don't think a game like this really needs a lives system, it would probably be enough just to dock your score when you die. There were a few rare instances where I failed to dodge an obstacle and kind of just clipped through it instead, which was helpful but probably something that might need fixing. The biggest flaw for me was that the voice actor (there's really only one with a speaking role) runs through her lines faster than a werewolf through a spaceship. Better voice direction would really have helped there, towards the end I was beginning to suspect they'd shot the cutscenes before they recorded the dialogue and panicked when they realised they weren't long enough to get out what little plot the game has.","August 6, 2014","true","4.2"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

The game handles running on your behalf, so you just need to avoid obstacles and go around corners. This is a lot harder than it sounds. I think it interesting that some people compared this to Temple Run. Yes its somewhat similar, but this feels much more like an old school arcade game to me.  The difficulty curve is pretty steep, your first few runs will probably end with you running into a wall. However once you’ve got to grips with the controls it becomes a lot more rewarding.  Nailing a difficult section with the soundtrack pumping makes you feel like a boss.\n\nThe pace of the game is FAST, you really have to concentrate at all times.

I can however rate it on its gameplay.\n\nI find Infinity runner is a game best entered with few expectations. It promises pretty much what you think it does. Its a first person action running simulator.\nThat said, its an on rails obstical course with an interesting twist. The werewolves in space theme allows you to turn into a hulking werewolf mid-run, and change many of the rules in your favor, as it should. The combat in the game (yes, it has combat) is in the form of QTEs depending on the position and number of enemies in a room. If you succeed the challenge, you are rewarded with a smash and kill style fight as your avatar kills everyone in the room and continues to run at break neck speeds.\nYes, you are running at break neck speeds as any failure to react correctly to the environment as it explodes around you is an instant death. Thankfully you as a player are barely penalised, as you are almost immediately put back into sonic speeds at revival.\nI rate this game highly because I believe it accomplised its goal almost entirely. I found myself glued to the screen, not trying to contemplate what was going on in the world, but instead reacting to my immediate environment. Each level brings its own style of obsticals, from literally jumping through space to sliding under gunships as they lay fire down on my naked body.\n\nI wouldn't play this game for the lore, but why would you?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/travizty/recommended/279920/","travizty","TraviztY ッ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/travizty/","726 products in account","Infinity Runner is a running game and its fairly similar to Temple Run and games of that sort, But played in First Person.\nI was actually really excited to play this title when I saw it in the coming soon section but after about an hour in the game I started to notice that the whole thing is kind of repetitive and I think I was expecting a little more from this game since it was on PC. It is still fun to play, its just not what I thought it would be.\nThe story takes place inside a ship called the Infinity, you wake up and have to escape by running down very long and dark tunnels and avoiding traps and fighting enemies. There is only a few times when you are actually in an enviroment where you can see around you. Which was dissapointing to me considering the store page listed it with "Stunning Graphics", I have yet to really see anything stunning. The graphics are decent enough though, they aren't terrible or anything. Most the time you're running too fast to notice any textures on the sides of you anyways. I ran it at max settings and it never dropped below 80-fps. There are quite a bit of video settings in the options menu too so anyone with a low end PC should be fine to run this, but as always check the system requirements first.\nAs far as playability goes, like I said before its kinda repetitive. You're stuck inside dark tunnels of this ship for most the game until the last area where you are in some biosphere which is still pretty dark and not much real scenery. You have to dodge obstacles and fight enemies using button sequences displayed on the screen which, I was hoping for a more hands on feel with the fighting like mirrors edge. The obstacles can be challenging at times though which i think is the best part of the game, I believe they are randomly generated so you never really know what to expect around the next corner. It could be several traps one after another or just empty long boring hallways. You also get to become a Warewolf at certain points\nwhich I didnt really understand and it makes it twice as hard to see. There are a few modes to choose from including Story, Arcade and Multiplayer, I have yet to experience the Multiplayer tho because no one is ever hosting. I attempted to host to see what it was like but no one ever joined so Multiplayer is dead from the start, I think the leaderboards serve a better purpose. Arcade mode allows you to play any level for time, score, or distance and is all randomly generated, and Story is just that, a story, and the map isn't random. So if you die, youll experience the same trap or enemies until you pass them and get to the next chekpoint.\nThe game is also supposed to be oculus supported but since I don't own one I don't know much about this part. I did however decide to read up on it a bit and apparently there is a huge fear of motion sickness in this game since there are scenes where you lose control of the player and the game takes over. I have heard that it can cause a lot of people to get headaches and sick and is even listed as a bad idea in the "Things NOT to do" Oculus dev guide. I thought it may seem like a good idea to play a game like this in VR at first but most people are saying no.\nAs far as the controls, They are very simple. Youre character runs by itself so there is no need to move yourself forward, You will only have to strafe left or right or jump or slide to dodge the obstacles. Fighting enemies requires that you follow a button sequence displayed on screen which is always a combitnation of the same keys just in a different order.\nI haven't had any crashes with the game or errors from what I have played and I've played every level.\nNow wether I recommend this game or not, Im still on the fence about it. It's fun to play for about 20 min but I personally get bored with it very quickly. If you like a challenge and you like running games it may be for you. The price tag runs at $10 and Im not sure its really worth that considering Multiplayer is dead from the start and the levels are really dark and mostly tunnels. I know its a space ship but I would have hoped for better lighting at least.\nAll in All im gonna rate it at a 6/10. Hopefully the next game to come out like this will be on a planet or somewhere with some actual scenery and lighting.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3v2EDNP8C0","July 17, 2014","false","2.7"," 28 of 46 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","28","46","0","1"

There's a bit of a story but it's pretty sparse and really an excuse to get to the running. Overall I found the running really fun. The backdrops are all pretty interesting in a sort of pulp sci-fi way (though sometimes on your first run it's hard to tell how to navigate some of the obstacles).\n\nThere is a lives system where you can die a certain amount of times and go back to a previous checkpoint rather than having to restart. The lives system seemed a bit unnecessary and I think I would have preferred (at least for story mode) to have infinite lives and just go back to the last checkpoint every time and maybe lose some points or something. Combat is executed by QTEs and the final boss fight killed me enough times that I had to restart the level a few times and that was a bit irritating.\n\nRunning feels great and navigating obstacles without losing momentum is super fun, but the mouse/keyboard controls can be a bit awkward. The game might feel a bit smoother with a controller.\n\nThe arcade mode is a true endless runner where you run through the different sections of the ship until you run out of lives, and I think that's where the game really shines. In arcade mode you can choose to turn combat off if you'd prefer to not have to deal with the QTEs.\n\nThere is a multiplayer mode of some kind but I didn't try it so I don't have an opinion on it.","July 24, 2015","true","6.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Not to mention the out of the ordinary concept of werewolves in space. I also enjoyed that there was plenty of obstacles to overcome by various methods such as sliding, quick time fighting sequences, jumping, and ziplining in human form and climbing on walls, crushing enemies with ease, and even breaking through walls in werewolf form. However, I noticed some things that I just could not brush off. For instance, after you have completed the first two sectors, your female friend in the game no longer follows along with the words that are being spoken by the voice actress. Its like she has mind of her own and it is telling her not to open her mouth. Also, there's not alot of ways to take down an oppenent. I don't expect the werewolf form to have many ways to take down an enemy (due to the fact a werewolf is a raging beast) but, I do wish the human form had more fighting styles since your main character was trained to be a deadly living weapon. The story is okay. Not the best story ever told but it does fill in the gaps (most of them anyway). The final issue I have with this game, and is also the biggest issue, is the controller support. I see most games give you more options in order to change the button layout to your own comfort level and they don't mix and match buttons in order to keep throwing you off, but that is all you ever see when you play Infinity Runner. For instance, you are given three configuration choices depending on your controller and what you feel most comfortable with: one for ps3, one for xbox, and one that is custom. The issue starts when you are in a fighting sequence against the guard when it tells you to press the press the A button, it actually means that you have to press the RB button. What!? The layout for the buttons is scattered all over thet place! When you press X, it actually means Y. When you press LT, it actually mean the start button. This was so unbearable that I had to stick with the playstation configuration becuase most of the buttons were in the right order. The only two buttons that switched places was R2 and R1, as well as L2 and L1. This was the most frustrating part of the entire game. Overall, my final verdict for this game is a 7/10. Infinity Runner is a over the top, sci-fi based, parkour simulator that has fast paced gameplay that will leave gamers wanting more of the adrenaline rush. But, there are also a ton of other issues that need to fixed right away. Otherwise this franchise will NOT reach it's full potential.","January 10, 2015","true","3.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

I've never really been attracted to the whole 'runner' style of game as it seems repetitive and dull but Infinity Runner smashes those clichés and really grabs you right from the off.\n\nYour main objective is to run down a spaceship in an attempt to escape. Sounds simple but man is it frustrating. The game slowly introduces new aspects and mechanics, which keep it fresh and enjoyable, QTE sequences, that you will be praying for more of and then it throws in a werewolf for good measure. A werewolf in space! Why wouldn’t you be interested?\n\nThe games aesthetics are really beautiful and the quality of the animations and voice acting are remarkable. The soundtrack is fantastic, especially when you’re running at that speed, and so making a massive jump or avoiding deadly lasers really makes you feel like a boss.\n\nA really enjoyable game for a good price and I will definitely be recommending it.

I could understand disdain for this if it were endless, or if there were exploitative microtransactions. This game has neither. It has a level structure, and it even has difficulty settings which affect the game in very interesting ways. Also: It's a bloody werewolf on a spaceship, you miserable old sadsack. What more could you ask for?\n\nTo throw some more details into this ball of words than that -- it's similar to endless runners on the tablets, except not at all. The level structure and controls (which feel rad) make it feel very different, it's more 'inspired by.' So the end result is a game that has more in common with SkyRoads and '90s PC shareware games than it does Temple Runner. That's not a bad thing, since Temple Runner and its ilk are 'pay to keep going' games. This is a 'be good enough to keep going' game. And if you're simply awful at it, well there's an easy mode for you, too (as I mentioned!).\n\nI don't know what there is to dislike about this, really. It's aesthetically pretty, it's fun to kill a few minutes with (when you don't have much time to spare), and it's priced accordingly. I can't understand why you'd hate this other than perhaps a.) you're young and your money is limited so you want your games to last longer and thus you're very invested in the fallacy of quantity -> quality (you'll learn), or b.) you're xenophobic and you hate Welsh people and werewolves??

The music also is probably some of the worst music I’ve listened to in a video game in a long time; bland and forgettable techno music\n- Unfortunately the graphics also are subpar at best. The textures on the environments are low quality and muddy, and the 3D models are also pretty poor; topped off with the repeated sections of the corridors you run through simply being uninteresting as well leaves much to be desired in the graphical department\n- Even at its short length (1 ½ hours on Normal difficulty), the game still does manage to be pretty repetitive. You will see the same gameplay sections (with the exact same QTEs as well) many times throughout the game; having a bigger variety in the sections or more levels would’ve been welcome.\n\n\nVerdict\n“While the game is very short and has little to no story, the focus on gameplay makes the game--at the very least--fun. I bought this game for about £2 and I feel I got my money’s worth, but I don’t really think it’s worth much more than that. Considering how few infinite runner-style games there are on the market at the moment, this one is at least acceptable in terms of quality and enjoyment.”\n\n6/10 TJBs","February 19, 2015","true","3.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Automatically run down a corridor dodging obstacles by hitting buttons at the right time. Left and Right to dodge left and right, click to jump, right click to slide, look left or right to turn down a corridor. Sounds simple enough in theory, right?\n\nYou'll quickly begin to notice problems when the environment starts falling apart on you. While the asthetics are cool to look at, the different chatoic elements often leave you with no way to reasonably discern what button to hit until it's too late. It turns the game from a fun, adrenaline fueled thrill ride into a frusturating chore of trial and error.\n\nThe particular bit that sticks out in my mind was where you ripline past two droids that are firing at you. The second droid gets in your way, and you have to drop off the ripline and slide under it. However, you can't slide until you've hit the ground, and it's really hard to tell when you've hit the ground in this game because of your extreme forward momentum and the first person perspective. It took several tries to figure out what percise moment to hit the button, again through trial and error.\n\nThis combines with controls that just aren't responsive enough. I have a pretty good gaming PC, and I turned my quality way down, and it still felt like their was a slight delay on every button press. It wouldn't be so bad if you wern't going so fast.\n\nAnother person might be able to look past these flaws and get immersed in the experience. For me, the above issues consistently ruined my immersion. If you want a good runner game, check out TEC 3001. Aside form the simpler graphics, it does everything this game does 10x better.","July 15, 2014","false","0.5"," 23 of 41 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","23","41","0","4"

It has huge potential but fails in almost every basic aspect of the gameplay. The core mechanics is simply a fast reaction game. You see an obstacle - you need to press a specific button. If you fails, you run from the checkpoint. 4 fails and you need to restart the whole level. Simple as that. The problem is, the obstacles are pretty much never recognizable. Eventually every time I saw a new obstacle I needed to die few times just to learn how to dodge it. After I knew it, it never was a challange anymore. This is another problem: when you go out of lives on a new hurdle, you need to replay the whole section which is a sea of boredom now, when you know handle it.\nBut, with all the things above, it would be a moderatly fine game, the controls are well responsive, the visuals create a really tense atmosphere, I had moments of enjoyment.\nThe real killers are QTE scenes. I tell you, it's the worst implemented QTE I ever saw in a game. And I saw quite a lot of bad QTEs. Let's give an example: in the middle of the run you see something on the left. If you think that it's obstacle and press right - well your bad, the key was right mouse button - restart! Eventually on the second try you wait with clicking anything, and, eventually, you see the right mouse button sprite. Awesome, you click it. Now you have a second to press next button - "A" is displayed. Wait, "A"? It will be backward, no!... Too late, restart! Not to mention, the whole UI for it is terribly unreadable, you have a second to press a button, yet you need some time to find the new button on the screen and then to process, if "D" means left, or maybe right... (I know it may sounds silly but believe me, in a span of the second, it's really hard to process those things, and it's super annoying since it's the mere core of the gameplay)\nTo write anything about other aspects of the game: The story is not engaging, not at all, it lacks any strong characters or plot, sounds are very annoying, however I really like the music and the mood overall. Sadly, due to those great flaws mentioned, I really can't honestly recommend this title.","March 31, 2015","false","3.9"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

The gameplay consists of a string of quick time events. But it is really cool so far. What can I say? It has Werewolves! in SPACE!!\n\n(optional let's play footage) lol we all posted videos, guess I get the leftover view right? =D\nhttp://youtu.be/2alrnFP6HME\nTip; as soon you boot up the game for the first time rebind jump to space and slide to Ctrl or your preferred FPS crouching key. You might find that you die a lot less from pressing the wrong button this way. They made some weird choices for some of the default key bindings.\n\nOkay funniest thing, if you don't look left or right to turn at corners your character will run straight into the wall 'THWACK!' and your dead lol. Yes you lose a life and have to go back to the last checkpoint. But the fact that you can kill yourself by stupidly running into walls is pretty amusing.\n\nYes the game has repetitive elements e.g. the same looking obstacles multiple times. However I think the pacing makes up for this. The player character is constantly running and only stops at the end of a stage or to take down enemies in quick time animations. The game definitely can become frustrating. You make the right action to avoid obstacles i.e. some can only be slid under while others you must leap over. If you accidentally jump for example when you should have slid you can't undo that action and you hit the obstacle. A lot of the obstacles are insta-death. I chewed through my lives dying repeatedly at the same spot and had to restart stages from the beginning several times. But I wouldn't go as far as to say that the game is unfair. You just need to think fast. And if you want you can change the difficulty to easy if you wish (I didn't try that though). It would be nice if the game paused when it gives you tutorial tips because by time I processed them it was too late and I died in the obstacle. Lastly it was exciting when I first transformed into a werewolf.\n\nThe graphics aren't 'AAA' standard but the game looks good. I liked the music. The dialogue from the holo-chick or whatever she is got a little bit annoying at times especially when you hear the same thing again and again because you have to repeat a stage several times. But surprisingly I later found that some of the dialogue was actually funny (intentionally).\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","July 14, 2014","true","0.8"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","0"

It has oculus rift support and also it obviously has keyboard controls, personally i'm using a keyboard for this review.\n\nThere are alot of bad points to this game: too hard to see most obstacles, tutorial barely lets you time to read the instructions and you're already dead: "Jump!" 0.5 seconds later you fall to your death. Unskippable cutscenes and just tedious to play in general. It's as if you have to remember what to do everytime you die and not re-do it the next time around in order to succeed (for the story mode, anyways).\n\nThe sadest thing is that the voice acting is not so bad, but the way her voices comes in, the amount of feedback and distortion in her voice, most of the time it just hurts my ears or I can't really understand what she's trying to say.\n\nMost obtacles are trial and error, because it's not quite clear what is needed to do. Also so far from the chapters i've played, which have 2 levels each, they reuse the same rooms that the other level had used in the same chapter. There's around 6-7 chapters with 2 levels each I suppose and they manage to reuse the same exact rooms in the same chapter, unbelievable!\n\nThe music is fine and the graphics are fine, but the gameplay is quite bad.

The game engine and visuals are reflective of the download size in my opinion, its a fairly average looking game and a world away from the neon stylings of Master Reboot.\n\nThe Metacritic score is justified, mixed reviews on Steam is fair comment.\n\nBoson X, also on Steam, at a mere £1.99 smashes Infinity Runner.

When playing this game, I wonder how anyone can mess up an infinite running game so badly. I don't even know where to start since everything just feels so poorly done. It feels like one of those things that came up in a brainstorming session that sounds interesting, like "hey, why don't we do it in space...with werewolves!" I can't say I'm sure what in the world is going on with the "story". The environments I really have to wonder if there was any play-testing to see how they actually worked. Heck, with that being said, I have to wonder if any of this game was play-tested. In conclusion to my rambling about this hot mess, I expect better from a free iOS/Android app, whereas this game costs $10. If I had payed this much and not gotten it from a cheap bundle, I can't imagine how awful I would feel.","February 22, 2015","false","3.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","1"

Twice the female character is about to reveal some major plot twist and twice she gets cut off, the game slapping a "TO BE CONTINUED" in your face at the last moment. Pointless.\nMusic is kind of awful, especially in the Docks area. Aural assault. Awful.\nOccasional lag issues.\nMultiplayer is non-existent basically, yet required for a few achievements.\n\nMajor complaints:\nThe entire game is trial-and-error based. Lots of stuff that you have basically no reaction time to see coming, lots of rooms with non-obvious solutions that you have to throw corpses at until you pass. Also, you have limited lives. And the levels are all several minutes long.\n\nBasically, no. That is inherently bad game design. There was no salvaging it at that point. The limited lives and abundance of "gotcha" moments are the only challenge this game provides though; except when the controls don't work (I've had slides and jumps fail numerous times). There's no difficulty here that feels like real difficulty, just fake difficulty that makes it unpleasant to play.\n\nA lot of things aren't graphically distinguishable either; in some areas it's near-impossible to tell which direction to turn until a fraction of a second before you need to turn. The falling sections of the game have mines in them which are practically impossible to see on the black backdrop of the section, too.\n\nAnd did I mention the game is repetitive as all hell? There are 4 times in the game where you run through a bonus area that is ALWAYS exactly the same. There are 3 times where you skydive through a section that is ALWAYS exactly the same. Every wolf section is basically a minute-long cutscene as there's only one way to die and once you figure out how to wall-run (which is, naturally, presented wrong; it shows mouse click and then holding A/D but you're supposed to press them the other way around, nice job there...) there's no challenge to it. There's almost no new obstacles presented past the third world aside from some badly-designed "figure out the sequence" rooms that tend to be non-obvious more often than not. There's a QTE boss at the very end of the game (which is... not very good). And that's basically it.\n\nThere's a smaaall bit of fun to be had with this initially but it wears off quickly and the problems with the game show through pretty quick, too.

Input lag is the first you'll run into and is prevelant through out the game, but once you're aware of it you can play around it. More seriously is in the later levels the FPS drops nearly into the single digits in some sections. This should not happen in a game that looks like its from mid-way through the PS2 era using a newer computer (less than a year old.) The framerate dorp mixed with the input lag makes the later stage diffficult and frustrating in the extreme to complete. Furthermore, I've had issues with falling through the level and running through obstacles but not taking damage or dying in the last few stages.\n\nEdit: Also found an encounter on the last level that is literally impossible to get past at current framerates (even with everything set to lowest settings.) A guard will de-cloak right on top of you, killing you before you can re-act to any prompt. I even jump past him on one encounter, but the game dragged me back to the spot and killed me instantly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/279920/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","This game just doesn't have it. Bad premise, gameplay, structure. The entire game you have no control, it's just somehow believable that you are on some ship and spend the entire time running around endless corridors and attack guards in the same way. I know if I was trying to do something I wouldn't be running as fast as possible endlessly through corridors.....how believable is that? The endless running doesn't even work. Every corridor and level looks and feels the same. Combat is boring, you hit WASD and click the mouse, although the buttons aren't even on the right corresponding spot on the screen, W which corrisponds to the top of the three buttons will be on the buttom right of the screen and A which is on the left will be after W on the top of the screen, not well done. Every fight you do the same thing, either attack 1 guy witht he same button cues or attack a group of three guys the same way with the same button cues. I guess the only way the game couldn't suck as much as it does is if it serves as an oculus rift demo game.\n\nThe jumping and sliding are stupidly programmed to right and left mouse click, which don't make sense and aren't intuitive, compared to space and C/ctrl, meaning when you have to decide to jump or slide last second, you have to think and remember every time, which is which, which leads to death due to poor game design. The jumping and sliding don't even work well. When you jump you are in the air for super long. I would jump something and by the time I finally landed I would be at the next spot to do something or it would already be too late to do something because the jump was unnecessarily long. Since jumping and sliding last forever, this means you have to actually do them way before it makes sense to, or you would do it any fps or platform game. Turning corners is done stupidly as well, as you move your mouse to the apparent side, instead of right and left buttons like A/D. This leads to you moving the mouse and it not counting because you didn't move it enough, or any other problems that makes it finnickier than it needs to be. You onyl get 3 lives per long running level, and if you die you have to restart everything all over again, which encourages repetition and pads game length, a dump idea. There are these cards but they basically do nothing, it makes it almost impossible to get an extra life from them, they should have made it easier or make more sense, so you have a point to collecting them. The game also doesn't use obstacles right. At certain points something like an explosion would happen after another one, but it wouldn't happen until I was already at it, and it would hit me from the side before I could react. The only way to beat this is to repeat it and know its coming to dodge it. How terrible for an endless runner to just auto kill you until you remember to make a movement before the cue is on the screen and give you enough time to do it.....that's their only job. At other parts, you don't know what movement to make. Certain times fire or smoke or some random thing you haven't seen will pop up and they for some reason don't make it apparent what you should do, meaning you have to take a random guess or die. This happened 2 times back to make, meaning I died and lost all my 5 min of running at that level. This means I had to restart the game from the start of the entire level because the game decided to spring instant death gambles on me. How could they screw up the basic ideas of a runner game. Not really much positive to speak of unfortunately. Multiplayer is 100% dead and arcade is just replaying the same levels. The game is boring, they mechanics aren't done well, and gameplay is flawed.

True, the story's very throw-away, the graphics are pretty lackluster, most of the achievements are easy to obtain, and it has a few other problems, but the gameplay itself is actually pretty fun, it has a decent soundtrack, and there's bloody Werewolves in space.\n\nI'd say that dispite it's many flaws, it's worth trying out at least once, though it'll probably be mostly forgotten about not long after completing the campaign and maybe running the Arcade or the Multiplayer modes a few times over, it's good for what it is while it lasts. 6.5/10","October 27, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
