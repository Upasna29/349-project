Well let Swerve tell you! This is going to be long as hell since I used to play the orginal a crap ton 3 years ago! So gather round children! Grab a seat and listen to the great story I am about to tell!\n\nDiplomacy:\n\nThe game provides a pretty solid diplomacy system that fits in very well with the backstory of the game. This means that it's harder to ally with Vasari rebels when you're a Vasari loyalist, unless you already premade the teams ofc. The computer or player can give you missions, if you choose to do them will improve your relations with them. Eventually if they like you enough they ask for peace treaties, powerful pacts (These buff both of your factions), trade agreements, ect. Even though diplomacy is useful in a game, it's not the core aspect of this game, you shouldn't buy it expecting it to be a game like Anno 1404 where war is only an option.\nYour goal is to kill everyone, not to make peace with them.\n\nTL;DR\nOverall it's a nice mechanic, it fits with the story, highly dynamic, and very diverse, but not the main focus of the game.\n\nCombat:\n\nPersonally, I think the combat is very simple.\nYou have your ship types:\n\n-The Frigate : Light, fast ships. Most are used for offensive means such as taking out strikecraft or bombing planets. Some are better at taking out other ships than others. I wouldn't call it rock paper siscors but it's kinda close to it.\n\n-The Cruiser : More expensive, but provide much more firepower and/or support than frigates. Enforcers/Crusaders/Kodiacs are probably going to be the front line of your fleet.\n\n-Srikecraft : I feel I had to put this in somewhere. Strikecraft can only be created by Carrier Cruisers or Capitalships/Titians. They cannot be targeted by normal ships so you either need to counter them by using more strikecraft or use specialized frigates to take them out. They do a crap ton of damage if you leave them unchecked.\n\nStrikecraft have 2 types:\n-Bomber (Good at taking out bigger ships)\n-Fighters (Good at killing bombers)\n-*Advent only* homing mines (They're mines)\n\n-Capital ships: These are essential for any fleet. They are very expensive *You get your first one free, so pick wisely" and very powerful ships that provide ALOT of utility and/or damage to the fleet. They are tanky, and usually the first, or last to go down. They act like Warcraft 3 heroes where they level up if you gain enough experience from killing things. These levels unlock abilites for your capital ships that do various things. (Ex. Kol Battleship, The ability  "Finest Hour" gives him massive Health Regen and  lowers cooldowns on his other ablities)\n\n-Titians : These things a freaking scary. Huge warships each faction/subfaction gets a specific one. They do alot of damage, they provide HUGE utility (Ex. The TEC Loyalist Titian buffs his allys with reduced weapon cooldown and gives them all more shields). It takes 5 points of research to fully build one, and even then It costs alot of money. It's best used in late game.\n\n-Starbases : These things are broken. I've turned around entire games using these things. They do LOADS of damage. You can counter them with a ship specialized in destroying buildings, because they out range them, unless you put them in the middle of the damn phase lane! Thats right, you can place them right where you enemy will enter and they wont even get a chance to say their prayers. And if you're TEC Loyaist, you can have 2. gg\n\n-Pirates!\nIf you ever play TEC Rebels you need buy a pirate fleet. Seriously. They have the best voice acting N/A. It's hilarious. There will be a pirate base on almost every map, you can place bounty on annother faction and they will attack the person with the most bounty. They don't have shields, they're kinda easy. Cool feature tho.\n\nDiversification:\n\nI think the ships are very well-designed. Each have their own jobs and none do the exact same job. They all look very different from one annother and are very detailed. They're voice acting is very professional. Overall they did a good job in diversification the different ships.\n\nMechanics:\n\nThe victor of a battle is mainly determined by whoever has the best ship composition and the most research. It's very rock paper siscors-esk. It's simple, you have shields, that protect the ship for so long and then breaks and then it does health damage, if it reaches zero the ship splodes.\nThere's no complex locational damage, They all just kinda stand still and hit eachother until they die. Realistically, no captian in his right mind would just stand there and let his ship get rekt. But it's based off an old engine so I'll let it go.\n\nHowever! The battles are epic as hell! Pretty lasers, Strikecraft flying all over the place, Capital Ships using they're cool\nguns. They look very pretty, but nothing else.\n\n\nEconomy:\n\nEconomy is simple as well. The 3 resources you have is Credits, Metal, And Crystals. You can get credits from planets, which you can upgrade to house more people to tax. You can get metal/crystal from extractors that can be built on asteriods orbiting the planets. You can also research and build trade ports and oribal refineries/Matter Processers. TEC are very good at amassing credits. The Vasari are very good at getting minerals. The Advent are mixed.\n\nYou also have a thing called "The Black Market" where you can buy and sell metal and crystals. It acts like a regular economy and if you sell too much the market crashes and it sells for literally nothing. If you buy too much the market booms and I think the price goes up by alot. Doesn't stop me from buying crystal tho, because lord knows I always need crystal. >.>\n\nEvery resource is renewable. It will never run out. However the more fleet upgrades you invest in, the more it will effect your economy (7 to 80% deduction without pacts/supply reductions). It actually makes turtling viable, and I KNOW EVERYONE ABSOLUTELY LOVES PEOPLE WHO USE THE GOOD OL' TURTLE STRATEGY.\n\nOverall the economy is like every other RTS. Just without gatherers or giving a damn about exhausting resources.\n\nThe Art:\n\nThis game is beautiful. I love it. Every planet, ship, and building is 1080p and professionally crafted. The battles are awesome because of all the colorful lasers. Every race has different ships which look just as professional as all the others.\n\nVoice Acting:\n\nGood stuff mayne. Professional voice acting. The voices fit the theme in ships ( Ex. TEC Rebel Titian "I put the laughter in slaughter!"). Everything just fits.\n\nP.S. Whoever voiced the pirate ships deserves a metal.\n\nStory:\n\nEven though this game has no campaign the opening cinimatic really gives you a good feel of the current state of the universe. The whole ambiance of the game gives off a desperate feel. Every race is tired of fighting, but cannot forgive eachother for the horrible atrocities that they committed against eachother (Hence the name Sins of a Solar Empire). Every side will do whatever it takes to win.\n\nIf you want to buy this game for story, there really is none besides the opening, sorry, play Mass Effect or something.\n\nConclusion:\nThis game brings a unique twist to the 4x genre. Providing a slow pased game that keeps you interested and on your toes. It includes a large research tree, many ships to choose from, very diverse races, and very pretty art. Though kinda simple it still holds a place in my heart. This has to be one of the best 4X games I've ever played.\n\nI'd say it's worth buying.\n\n(insert X/10 joke here)\n\n\n\n\n","September 23, 2015","true","149.2"," 280 of 294 people (95%) found this review helpful 60 people found this review funny","95","280","294","60","5"

The difficulty of the game can be tweaked to suit anybody's needs, wether your'e looking for a quick 1 on 1 match against an easy opponent or an 8 player free for all against ruthless AI, or compete against real human beings online.  Be warned though, matches can last for hours and hours, this can be a good or bad point depending on your play style.  Visuals are great, so much satisfaction to be had in zooming all the way in on your massive fleets and watching them demolish your rivals empire in flurries of lasers, and explosions.\n\nLong story short, if your'e into games like Total War, Glactic Civilizations, Supreme Commander then your'e definately going to want to pick this up.  40$ is a little steep though so look for it to go on sale, I was able to pick it up for 8$.\n\n","November 25, 2013","true","35.1"," 205 of 220 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","205","220","0","10"

Lets begin with the Gameplay. You can choose between 3 Races: TEC (Trader Emergency Coalition) they are human, The Advent was originally a desert religious cult that mastered psychic powers and The Vasari they are the only alien race in the game. A new feature: For every race (TEC,Advent,Vasari) you can choose between Loyalists and Rebels both of them have their own advantages and abilities. You have many possibilities to start a game (defensive, offensive or aggressive) but to win at the end you have to attack the other empire (other players or KI). The intelligence of the KI is pretty well and if you play on a higher difficulty like unfair its really hard to win the game especially if you play agains more than one player for example 5 or even more. (10 players max.) The graphics are really nice and the galaxy with all its stars solar systems and planets looks just awsome. Only if you zoom really close to the planets you will see that their surface is fashioned a little bit boring. But all ships, frigats, star bases and structures look nice and really realistic. One of the coolest features in this game are the Titans the biggest ships you can build. Every player can only have one Titan at the same time because theyre really strong especially as support if you attack with more capital ships and a fleet. Only a full developed star base can fight against this strong ship. You can play in small solar systems with 9 planets or you can choose the biggest map: a galaxy with five solar systems and about 150 planets. Thats really big and you will need a long time to discover the whole galaxy with all its secrets and resources. Resources a one of the most important things in the game you can earn: credits (from: taxes, war and allies) metal (mainly from extractors but also from allies and war) crystal (mainly from extractors but also from allies and war). As soon as you have enough recources, planets and a few defensive structures you can start to discover the galaxy and to build your fleet with many little ships, capital ships and you big Titan. Then you can attack other empires to get their planets because for a big empire you need much space. But maybe the will attack you before you you are ready and thats the difficulty with this game: YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT! Thats what makes this game so interesting. Lets come to an end: This game is worth buying! You need to invest time but once you have understood everything the fun begins and you can start building many empires.\nI hope i could help you. :)","December 24, 2013","true","377.7"," 241 of 275 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","241","275","0","25"

See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is a massive real-time strategy game developed by Ironclad Games and published by Stardock Entertainment. It is the third standalone expansion in the popular Sins of a Solar Empire line of games and stands as testament to why this genre can only work with the PC Platform. Although the game is classified as an RTS, it does feature a lot of 4X (Civilization type) elements which the developers are calling the 'RT4X' genre.\n\nPLOT (No Spoilers):The player takes control of a space faring civilization whose sole objective is to be the most dominant force in the Galaxy. Achieve this either through military force, diplomatic means or economic superiority. Lead your civilization from a small single planet colony into a vast interplanetary empire spanning multiple worlds and multiple star systems.\n\nPROS:+ Epic in scale (The player can choose to either play in one solar system only, or expand their empire to other solar systems if the map permits)\n+ Massive space combat and intense fleet engagements\n+ Beautiful Graphics and Visuals\n+ Good ship and space station variety\n+ Ship and space station customization and upgrades\n+ Complex and solid core gameplay\n+ Simple and easy to manage Empire Tech Tree\n+ Incorporates the features of the previous expansions without forcing you to buy them\n+ High replayability\n+ Seamless Zoom Function (Marvel at your fleet or the intense ship on ship combat)\n+ Playable even with some lower end computers\n+ Modding potential (Example: See Star Trek 3 Armada mod)\n\nCONS:- No Campaign mode and even if there was...(see below)\n- Story is negligible\n- Steep learning curve\n- Capital/Titan Ships and Space stations have no hardpoints (see Star Wars: Empire at War space combat)\n- Only three main factions to play (although there are 6 sub-factions)\n- Stardock Account Management\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME but NOT FOR EVERYONE. If you're the type of gamer who's really into real-time strategy or 4X games and have a lot of free time to burn, then this game would be great.\n\nWORTH IT?:GOOD BUY and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for Space, Sci-Fi, RTS and 4X fans.\n\nFINAL NOTES:It's massive in scale with dozens of ships clashing in some of the most epic space warfare I have ever seen. Outside of combat, it has a good and complex empire management system akin to the 4X genre. The game also runs surprisingly well with the last generation computer systems since its game engine still only need the system requirements back in 2008 when it was first released.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

And believe me, alot will happen!\n\nI highly recommend to buy those 2 DLC pacs (Forbidden Worlds, Stellar Phenomena) too for they increase the variety of game styles and makes your game even more different with few twist (NOT GONNA SPOIL)\n\nAnd community drives hard! Online is the best choise for that is where the knowledge is!\n\nSome information about the game itself:\n\n- Tutorial goes from basic to advanced\n- No missions to play, just full galazys to conquer\n- Up to 8 factions to choose from with own unique strategys to offer\n- Unique ship styles\n-Up to 2000 (!!) fleet supply and that does not inclue strike craft supply!\n- Up to 8 player maps\n- Very good selection of maps to choose from. From small map to INSANE over 100 planets and if DLCs inclue... (SPOILER!!)\n\nI let you ofcourse to make the decision but there are only two sides, Allys or rebels...

Not very visually pleasing.\nNew ships will say a quote after the construction is finished.

The research trees are fairly comprehensive and cover everything from civilian, military, diplomatic and defence branches each with 30-40 techs in each branch. Therefore there can be different strategies each playthrough to some extent. But the combat is fairly satisfying as well as visually pleasing but the real beauty of Sins is the vast repository of mods available for it on sites like ModDB - Sins of a Galactic Empire (Star Wars), Star Trek Armada 3 are probably two of the most comprehensive you could check out, but there are many more. Therefore as well as the great base game you also have access to whatever particular science fiction genre you want to simulate with the solid game engine. What I would suggest for those familiar with them are programs like large address aware; but more for the mods as opposed to the base game as they tend to crank up the population capacity of ships compared to vanilla. (Due to engine constraints it only utilises the old school 4gb of ram limitation even if you have 16gb; LAA or similar will remedy this problem and allow for late game battles on a massive scale.)","June 11, 2015","true","381.0"," 63 of 66 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","63","66","3","0"

When you zoom out this detail is replaced with a clear tactical overlay making it easy to transition between tasks, all intuitively done with the mouse scroll wheel & pointer location. UI is low frills, but very functional.\n\nA.I. is also well designed, smart & strong! If you are not quick & know your strategy, at harder difficulties, they will give you a real battle for your survival! Further challenges can be found in the achievements, which challenge you to only research one tech tree or not to build a type of ship. These mix up the gameplay & I enjoyed trying to get these ones. I'm still hunting for the elusive Space Ponies! :)\n\nDLCs so far have been relatively small feature enhancements, but all worthwhile grabbing as they add a few more new things to the Sins universe. There are also some great total conversion mods (& other mods) out there to try, like one of my favs, the Star Wars total conversion mod called Sins of a Galactic Empire. Worth checking out.\n\nSins pretty much has it all from unique alien factions, diplomacy & extensive tech trees to missions & trading.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trancek/recommended/204880/","trancek","Trance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trancek/","91 products in account","Ironclad Games's first released title, and a decent RTS which I consider to be at the halfway point between traditional RTS and 4X. It might even be safe to call it a real-time 4X.\nAs gameplay mechanics go, SOASE is sound, if a bit simplistic. Rock-paper-scissors unit relationships abound, and unit spam is unfortunately a viable strategy in some situations. Each of the three factions is specialized to excel in certain capacities, resulting in widely varying overall strategies and battle tactics. SOASE features hero units in the form of capital ships, which again specialize in certain roles and progress in a MOBA-like fashion, gaining experience through combat, leveling up, and gaining or upgrading abilities (culminating in a powerful "ultimate" ability at level 6). Most battles typically hinge on the survival or destruction of one's capital ships, as they become more and more important targets through leveling.\nTechnically speaking, combat isn't the ONLY way to win a SOASE match. Like your typical 4X game (say, Civ V), victory conditions can be set which allow for several different paths to win through, for example, cultural influence or technological progress. However, again like your typical 4X game, most matches are won by pure conquest anyway. I don't think I've ever turned on those extra victory conditions since I started playing; conquest is good enough for me.\nThe Rebellion expansion adds factions-within-factions, with each race dividing in half to offer more specialization, as well as faction-specific Titan-class supercapitals, massive investments in time and resources which serve as the nucleus of an effective late-game fleet.\nAnd that's... really about all I can say. I find it quite fun, both alone and with friends, but if I'm honest, there just isn't enough there to be worth the dollar amount Ironclad is asking for. I understand they're still a fledgling studio that needs the sales to improve and progress as developers, but frankly I believe they're only hurting their prospects by charging $40 when there isn't $40 worth of game. It is, however, a good value for $20 which is the price at which I bought it on sale, and of course any sale price lower than that is even better. The game's capacity for randomization can ensure no two matches are the same, so the replay value on Sins is quite high, but replay value based on randomization is not, in my eyes, a good enough substitute for actual content to justify a price tag approaching that of a AAA title.\nFinal verdict: definitely worth playing, AND worth buying, if on sale. Don't pay full price for this.","June 19, 2014","true","423.6"," 55 of 62 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","55","62","0","0"

The 3 races play very differently from one another and the sub-factions are distinct enough to make you change your style depending on whether you're the Loyalists or Rebels.\n\nThe game's pace can be easily adjusted in the pregame options to suit your skill and the AI does a good job of building counters to your units (e.g. you build long range, AI builds corvettes). Having said that, the AI has a greater emphasis on the Artifical as opposed to Intelligence as it essentially attempts to win through attrition.\n\nBut such AI strategies are to be expected and, in my opinion, lead to some pretty epic battles. Build a starbase on a key chokepoint and station a fleet there to try and hold the line, if you're playing Hard or higher the AI will be charging your line in no time with capital ships, frigates, corvettes, cruisers and even titans.\n\nThe game is also extremely moddable. If you can read this review you can mod a good portion of Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion. There are also tonnes of mods already created (Halo, Star Wars, Star Trek, etc.).\n\nFinally, while the game does not have a campaign I personally feel this is no loss. Honestly ask yourself, "Would I play the campaign more than three times?" Probably not unless there was some meaningful reward (which would be difficult to work into the game). As a result, the omission of a four to eight hour campaign is no big loss.\n\nI could go on and on but I'm worried you'll keep reading when you should just go get the game already!","October 12, 2014","true","405.8"," 41 of 43 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","41","43","3","0"

Cheap for what you get, lots of mods. Good optimization, much pretty. Music nice, gameplay nice, must play for space RTS fans.\n\nSins of a Solar Empire is a space RTS with no campaign, but endless replayability. Every game, the universe that the game is played in is randomized, or selected from a premade map (which offer specific challenges to make the game more interesting). There can be many stars in one universe, and each star can have very few or very many planets, asteroids, wormholes, etc.\n\nThe game offers a very nice blend of combat, research, and dimplomacy. But research really trumps everything, which leads into one of Sins' flaws... the difficulty curve. This game will kick your â¥â¥â¥ if you are a newcomer to the RTS genre, and even if you are a veteran, you will find a good challenge. This game is not for the easily frustrated, because going against AI, or other players, can really pump up the blood pressure sometimes.\n\nThe game itself runs very well for my system. I'm running it on an AMD FX 6300 Processor, NvidiaGTX 660, with 8 GB of RAM, and it runs perfectly fine. It is very well optimized and looks beautiful. The backgrounds of space look phenomenal and the ships look pretty good too. Watching the space battles can be so nice to look at that you forget to make sure they are actually doing alright.\n\nAnyway, This game is worth the $40, but I would also cash in for the DLC, because they are very good for the price. The modding potential for this game is amazing as well. If you ever get bored of the basic game, you can just browse the giant selection of quality mods on Moddb. If there is a popular movie/TV/game/book series taking place in space, there is a good possibility that there is a well made mod already created, or being crafted of it.\n\nThanks for reading, if you got this far, and I hope this review helps, although the fact that there are already 1,000's of positive reviews made for this game should be a clear indication of the quality of Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion.\n\n","January 30, 2015","true","61.7"," 41 of 44 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","41","44","0","0"

But if Rebellion commits any sins of its own, it's in the 37$ price tag, which seems excessive for an expansion that will almost certainly strike its loyal fans as little more than a meaty content patch.Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion adds some nice features to a great, proven winner of a game. Those features are nice, but as nice as they are, I couldn't really see myself running out and throwing down nearly forty bucks for this standalone expansion if I already owned the original Sins, to say nothing of its expansion packs.But on the other hand, Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is an outstanding and unique real-time strategy game that offers a welcome, slower alternative to StarCraft 2's intense pacing. As a life-long fan of sci-fi space battles, I simply can't help but strongly recommend it.The important part here is that Sins of a Solar Empire still delivers a very unique kind of strategy game, and Rebellion doesn't screw with that; instead, it makes that base game substantially smoother and more interesting.","July 2, 2014","true","220.9"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","39","43","0","0"

This version basically combines the entirety of the 2 previous titles, Trinity and regular ol' SoaSE, so Rebellion truly has it all and more.\n\nAs such, this review is kind of both a Rebellion review and SoaSE in general review, because I've never reviewed the original or Trinity as there is no real story to this game, which makes it a difficult game to even explain to the masses who enjoy story driven games.\n\nI tend to play a Single Player skirmish with 2 or 3 Hard AI players, however in the past have spent a great deal of time playing lengthy LAN matches, which were loads of fun, but ultimately one of the only major flaws of SoaSE comes out through such lengthy matches, even just playing against AI.\nThat flaw has been given a bad wrap in more recent times because of the evolution and adoption of Multi Core processor technology.\n\nEssentially this game does not utilise multicore CPU's and unfortunately there is no fix for this, even after extensive research and optimisation mod trialling. But to their credit, those mods are great for getting the game to run on lower spec systems, laptops, virtualisation/steaming etc, but no mod can add 64bit or multicore support. That's the game's engine limitation, and it's not the only one around... I'm looking at you Cities XL.\n\nIt is important to note that at regular playing speed, this takes tens of hours of a single match to even be a problem, but on lower spec, lower (and older) GHz systems, this happens within about an hour give or take 30mins of regular speed play time with a couple of AI players.\n\nWith all that said, one of THE greatest longevity features for me is the ability to speed up the game time by 2x, 4x and 8x increments, even in a LAN match (host must change it).\n\nBecause of the vast expanses of space and [travelling] time at regular speed, this speed up feature can actually make for a much more challenging game, albeit much faster. Generally you will have to sacrifice micro management for macro at those speeds, but on large scale maps with only 2 or 3 players, with multiple star systems, the ability to speed up hyperspace travel from a distant planet to another is a HUGE time saving and action creating element and there is no penalty or lock down on the control of the game speed that you have, apart from it's 4 presets, so interchanging between them can be as fluid as zooming in or out and the speed controls can be remapped as well as basically everything else.\n\nWhen I first discovered this speed up feature in the original Sins, it was, at first, not something I was looking for or really cared about, largely because I was still learning the controls and the game at the time.\nWhen I was finally bored with the amount of time it took to setup, capture, defend, build and deploy, it would be too long for a single game session, and that bothered and still bothers me.\n\nCommand & Conquer (up until and including 3) had the right recipe for possible lengths of a single player skirmish battle. With Sins this isn't possible at regular speed, that is if you're interested in actually establishing a large empire of any sort instead of rushing with a dozen weak ships, which gets stale fast.\n\nThe camera controls in Sins are very fluid and quite unique, and once you get the hang of it, there really is nothing like it, some things are similar but the ability to orbit and zoom freely around any axis while fixed on a certain point is impressive, and the instant ability to track any of your fleet and zoom right in to the ship and it's details or zoom right out to galaxy level all in real time and fluid as your mouse can move. An RTS camera/movement system that IMO rivals that of what Blizzard, Westwood or EA have ever done is definitely worth a mention in this review.\n\nThe 3 original factions, the TEC, Advent and Vasari have been Loyalist-ised and given their Rebel counterparts in this final Sins title and have created many new ways of playing the game. I found that this is by far the most balanced of the 3 in the series mainly because of the 3 extra sub-faction additions, which also open up Role-Playing type elements of having say, 3 Rebel factions vs 3 Loyalist factions in a desperate struggle to take control over a strange galaxy.\n\nThe in-game Map Designer is also worth a mention, although it takes a fair bit of trial and error to get something you're happy with, and even then playing your own creations can sometimes backfire or surprise you in ways you never thought possible.\nThe only downside is the lack of manipulation you have on Planets and Stars. The "Map Designer" is basically a Map Generator.\nIf you've ever wanted to take on several hundred space pirate homeworlds in the one solar system then Sins is for you!\nBut in all seriousness, the Map Designer does a pretty good job once you learn how it works and ways you can create interesting maps just by changing sliders and numbers.\nIf you're really serious about designing your own Solar System or Galaxy then Ironclad have supplied everyone with their GalaxyForge editor which is used to create the many included Single and Multiplayer premade maps.\n\nMy Pros & Cons shortlist;\n\nPros:\n+ One of a kind space-based RTS gameplay\n+ Useful and informative dialogue boxes, hovering over icons has been given great attention to detail.\n+ Massive tech tree\n+ Awesome scale of real time space battles and large scale empire building.\n+ Fine control over placement of your buildings, or for riskier, faster matches, an "Auto place" feature for Buildings which is also a +\n+ Interesting and unique items, ships, power-ups, upgrades\n+ The graphics scale really well across many many different types of systems, but the close up details can be a bit disappointing even at Ultra settings.\n+ Inclusion of both a Map Designer & GalaxyForge editor.\n\nCons:\n- Fairly steep learning curve and long match times\n- Units (mainly Capital Ships) of the same type have to be upgraded individually, on a small scale this is less important then on a larger one.\n- No minimap\n- Left Planet, Structure and Unit tree can't be hidden. Capturing more than 10-20 planets adds much more time navigating and cuts any efficiency of the tree at all.\n- Some tasks would be better left automated, such as the 2 scout ships that you start with should have their exploration ability Autocast set to on, not off. Also Metal and Crystal mines could be auto-built after you have captured a planet and have the resources to spare\n- At regular speed it takes far too long to reach higher tech levels in a single match\n- Can be boring in stages of early travel or exploration. Once you've seen the same variations of desert, ice, volcanic, terran and asteroids over and over, the excitement wears down over time (tens to hundreds of hours for me)\n- Not just a con of Sins, but most RTS games really need the ability to 'mute' a certain Unit or Building you are queuing up and and creating 50 or 100+ of the same Units and the game wants to announce the successful creation of every single one.\n\nStory: 4/10\nAI: 7/10\nSound/Music: 7/10\nVoice: 6/10\nControls: 9/10\nModels: 8/10\nTextures: 8/10\nSpecial Effects: 9/10\nReplayability: 7/10\n\n65/100","December 23, 2014","true","86.6"," 48 of 59 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","48","59","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlWayZFrE3/recommended/204880/","AlWayZFrE3","D3vious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlWayZFrE3/","221 products in account","The following describes my experience every time I play this game.\n\nThe first scenario.\n\nI take my sweet time, playing turtly and expanding slowly, mainly because I'm still fresh from Endless Space and rapid expansion is dangerous, in my mind. I fully upgrade every single world until I can make my empire like a house, except I paint each indavidual brick before I lay it, polish it, and make it amazing. A slow process.\n\nThen the enemy fleet arrives, bristling with LRM frigates and siege engines, capitol ships all over the damn place, shredding my meager defenses while I scramble to make some kind of response fleet. I lose in minutes when this happens. Hours of work, gone in seconds.\n\nThe second scenario.\n\nI make one capitol ship right off, usually the one with colonization capability, and build a fleet to defend it before I even start growing. From there, I expand. The colonization fleet dives into the universe and takes everything not bolted down, planting my flag in every piece of dirt they can find. While this is happening, I'm researching like a madman. Everything from the civilian tree goes first, mainly mining and expansion assistance. I'm able to colonize any world by about minute fifteen, and do so with abandon.\n\nWhile the colonization fleet is away, I build up the battle fleet. More capitol ships, hundreds of frigates and cruisers, and a Titan being build in the corner of my home gravity well. My scouts find pirates, enemy players/AI, and all number of worlds. I take everything I can get my hands on and build up more gauss cannons than I can count. If anyone pokes around my systems, they don't leave alive.\n\nFinally, I run into worlds that I can't take with my small colonization fleet. So I pull them back. The enemy mounts an assault, thinking me weak. I let them come, break their backs on my frontier worlds, cracking their armor on my defenses.\n\nThen the battle fleet arrives.\n\nI destroy their assault force in moments, my capitol ships shredding anything in their path, Titan mysteriously AWOL, and drive them back four systems or more before they manage to scramble up a defense. When they do, my Titan and its auxilery fleet arrive...behind them. On a world where they have few defenders, she enters the fray, and ignores the first three worlds completely. Her goal is the capitol. In a desperate attempt to keep their forces strong enough to fight me, the enemy pulls everyone back to the capitol system, and mounts their last stand.\n\nI leave no survivors.\n\n\n\nThis game is amazing. A little slow, as it usually takes me an hour just to get comfortable with my standing, but oh so very addicting. The above situations happen often, rather than once or twice in a while, and though it does take a long time to build up your fleet, seeing it warp in out of nowhere is a warming experience I've yet to feel elsewhere. Endless space scratched the itch to rule an empire. This scratched my itch to conquer the galaxy.\n\nI'm not one for numbers, but this one gets an 11/10. Best played with friends and open alliances, over coms where you can covertly talk to each other. The envoys let you spy on 'allies' easily, and the diplomacy is enough to play the sides until you emerge on top. I've nearly lost friends for the plays I make here, feinting aggression to one faction when really I'd had envoys with them the whole time, and that battle fleet I'd been prepping was for my early game 'ally' that was a little too demanding with my resources.\n\nLove at first conquest.","April 23","true","20.4"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","97","31","32","11","0"

Mankind fights an endless - no wait sorry, that's a different game. It's not even an original video game, it was based on a tabletop game. This is a completely different game.\n\nThousands of years in the future, the ways of war have been forgotten (oh my god, this is literally the exact opposite of 40k, how did I get those two mixed up, what'm I like?) and an era of peace and prosperity has been ushered in for mankind.\n\nThen the aliens came. Fleeing from a terror they know nothing about, they laid waste to the outer worlds and took humanity completely by surprise.\n\nThen, because when things go wrong they go really wrong, a faction of exiled psionics returned after their long exodus calling themselves the Advent, also laying waste to the outer worlds. Man, the outer worlds really suck. If I lived in space, I'd stay the hell away from outer worlds of any kind. They're always full of criminals or the first to be hit by an invasion or whatever, always live near the centre of a space empire. Remember the Star Wars prequels? Actually, don't remember the Star Wars prequels, they were awful. But the Outer Rim sucked in those too. Well everything sucked, but the Outer Rim especially.\n\nAnyway, the traders united to form the TEC, or Traders' Emergency Coalition, to fight off the other two armies and none of this is relevant at all. Seriously.\n\nWait, let me check... Nope, definitely irrelevant. I can't find a campaign mode anywhere. Why would they do that? Who does that!? Who writes a backstory and then gives no story!?\n\nWell alright then. It's a space RTS. Instead of soldiers, you blow up spaceships. You conquer planets. You play as one of the three factions mentioned above, as either Loyalist or Rebel. In many matches, this is all to get the resources for building a really big spaceship called a Titan, and those are awesome. They've got great abilities. Vasari (aliens) Loyalists get a Titan that can eat spaceships. And Advent Rebels get a Titan that can heal itself as your other ships are blown up. The TEC just get boring grey stuff for boring grey humans.\n\nA single match can last anywhere from a few hours to a week. Actually, if it lasts for a few hours, that's because someone has ragequit.\n\nThe final verdict is, it's a unique and fun RTS about blowing up spaceships, which is pretty much every sci-fi fan's dream. It's not without bugs or cheating AI, but it's definitely worth buying if you want a decent game to play with friends.","January 27","true","8.8"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","91","31","34","25","0"

You have to love RTS titles to begin with in order to get all you can out of this game. That being said, this may be the greatest RTS game ever created.\n\nPro:\n\n- Intricate, detailed gameplay that allows for nearly infinite strategies, compounded by six readily distinguishable classes, each with easily understood strengths and weaknesses.\n\n- Gorgeous gameplay, small battles feel like a desperate struggle, large battles feel like an epic contest of ultimate power, and all planet/star models are meticulously rendered into sprawling heaps of sublimity.\n\n- Early/Mid/Late game all allow for new strategy to be applied, letting the player modify their tactics to better meet the assuredly unexpected challenges they face.\n\n- In-Game map creator allows for pretty much any map style the player could ever want.\n\n- Solid multiplayer mode, far less lag than would be expected for a game of this sheer magnitude.\n\n- Player interface is smooth and allows at-hand modification for hotkeys, etc.\n\n- Extremely advanced AI, on harder difficulties your robot opponents will be very difficult to defeat.\n\nCon:\n\n- The learning curve is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ brick wall. At least two or three hours of tutorial + practice are required before you stand a chance of beating even the Easy AI.\n\n- Micromanaging is a must, although I love it, assigning keybindings for every possible ability and advancement can be tedious, and is unfortunately a must for high-end competitive play. Not much is required for basic play, but for some, dealing with planetary income/resource/optimization issues will be a chore.\n\n- This game is an enourmous time investment, I've played matches that lasted over twelve hours. The shortest match I've ever played was probably about two hours.\n\n- No campaign mode. I hate to even say it, but if this game had one, it would shine brighter than a pulsar.\n\nEssentially, if you like RTS games, strategy games in general, or mentally challenging games in more general still, you will love this. I've spent hundreds of hours (I bought and played independently before buying on steam for multiplayer reasons) and none of them I feel have been wasted. I love this game, and I truly believe it is the best RTS game ever made, despite what minor (to me) flaws it may have.","April 16","true","162.2"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","25","27","2","0"

I once played a multiplayer match with friends, that we had to save and spanned over 4 days, a total of like 18 hours for ONE match.  Luckily the game saves every few minutes and you can resume when you like too.\n\nIf you never played a Sins game then you will need a little outside help I think because it is a tiny bit complicated because it has a lot going on, and a lot of things to do, but in the end it is worth it.\n\nThe game worth the time? Yes\nThe game worth the Â£29.99?

It's a very fun and enjoyable game, and for that I recommend it. HOWEVER, fans of the original SOSE should know that the publisher, StarDock, has made a complete 180 on the subject of DRM and their treatment of customers since they originally published their "Gamer's Bill of Rights." If you are a die-hard opponent of DRM, I can not recommend giving them your money to buy this title. They have made it a requirement now to register a Stardock account to activate the game, and you only get one activation.\n\nTL;DR: If you don't care about DRM, this is a good game if you like the genre. If you do, however, giving stardock your money now, for this, sets a bad example. I wouldn't have bought it if I had known. Now that I have, though, I'm enjoying it.\n\nIf you don't want to buy this because of the DRM, look into the original SOSE title, as it was published 100% DRM-free. Buy that instead, as it's really not that different from this expansion.","June 21, 2014","false","18.1"," 92 of 145 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","92","145","4","10"

Marketed as a stand-alone expansion for Sins of a Solar Empire, Rebellion basically sums up every mechanic introduced in every expansion to date - fight off pirates and opposing empires, establish trade routes, colonize or raise every planet in your solar system... and beyond. It has the same addictiveness as Civilization, in that you feel like you're playing a board game in which your faction fights to rule the universe using various tools or domination and manipulation, every match a new iteration in the array of destinies you can forge. On top of that, the space battles are impressive in both scale and effects: tons of freaking laser beams, rockets and machine gun fire keep you at the edge of your seat when a few hundred ships in your fleet meet a few hundred of your opponents' craft and clash in a display of fireworks that is so visceral and pretty it blows your brains out and leaves you slack jawed at the display of awesomeness.\n\nBUY it if you:\n-Enjoy RTS games and civ builders alike.\n-Want to engage in large-scale space battles with budget hardware (the game's zoom function works like a miracle, letting you join in on epic skirmishes or zoom out to manage your home planet in the blink of an eye).\n-Always wanted to recreate the Dominion assault on Deep Space Nine or some other notoriously nerdy science fiction scene you're almost embarassed you enjoy so much.\n\nDO NOT BUY it if you:\n-Hate the pacing of RTS games (learning hotkeys, developing effective build orders and being fast in setting your bases is essential to mastering Sins of a Solar Empire, and if you need time to think things through, you might be better off waiting for Civilization: Beyond Earth for your 4X fix).\n-Expect a campaign or any kind of predesigned narrative - Rebellion has none.","September 29, 2014","true","33.5"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

(You can save and come back later)\nIntroduction of Subfactions to each species doubles the faction options from 3 to 6.\nIncludes everything from previous Sins games.\nAs a Former Halo Player, I have high extremely high standards to what a soundtrack should be like. Bought the soundtrack, best decision I've ever made  TEC Loyalists - Watching The Borders  Absolutely beautiful soundtrack. Unique to each faction, and deviations for each subfaction.\nSurprising amount of depth, you've got your defense to manage, your own fleet for attacking targets, resource generation to worry about, politics and diplomacy are surprisingly in depth if you do some reading about how the game works. UPGRADES FOR EVERYTHING JUST LISTED TO CONSIDER. Yes, you can upgrade your diplomacy, something our current world could bother doing.\nIf the person hosting has the DLC for the game, everyone gets access to it. Forbidden Worlds adds new types of planets, if the host has it, you'll see these planets in game and you can get the research for them, colonize them etc. Also applies to Stellar Phenomena, if the host has it, you'll get stuff like Coronal Mass Ejections screwing with your planets, but then the'll move on else where (maybe to your enemy). Just like Random Crits in TF2: They Give and Take.\nALL SHALL FEAR YOUR SUBFACTION SPECIFIC TITAN AND FACTION SUPER WEAPON AND YOUR FLEET OF MIGHTY CAPITAL SHIPS\nThe Good  You can change victory conditions and in game speed of progression, this game takes awhile to play.\nMultiple types of victory conditions like "Capital" means you actually have an objective that isn't going to take 10 hours to complete if you don't set them, else it defaults to "Last Man Standing" which means you have to completely clean out your enemies. I recommend playing Capital Victory first time around.\nIf you want to sit down and conquer a galaxy, you can, but it's gonna take awhile (~4 - 6 hours based on opponent)\nIf you want to conquer  Multiple Galaxies  you can, but it's gonna take awhile. (8+ hours based on opponent)\nIf you want to fight over a single star system with just a handful of planets, you can! (2 - 4 hours based on opponent)\nSurprisingly simple interface that noobies can use easily, and vets can master with a bit of poking around.\nThe Bad  As said before, depending on your scenario, this game can take AWHILE to play. Depends on your view, but I've gotta throw this in The Bad section because spending half your day conquering a Galaxy is both kickass and tedious at the same time.\nBesides capital ships, most of the Frigates and Cruisers don't seem to have much strategy behind them except "Build a bunch of everything". More Experianced players will know how to use these, but it's not immediately clear to noobies the difference between each of the frigates. Cruisers doesn't have this apply as much to them, but it's still worth noting.\nFrustratingly slow start up to each game. You'll be scraping the bottom of the barrel for resources and unlike other games that don't allow you to manage resources, you simply get continous deposits, you'll find yourself never getting a head.\nFighting online you will either run into people that don't have enough time to sit down and enjoy a game, not really the game's fault, but it's worth noting. OR they'll be so damn good you don't even stand a chance. I typically play Free For All with optional alliances, so you can build up with other factions that might be on your door step, and plot against those that'll be gunning for you. Alliances with other factions with their own alliances do not carry over to you, so you can absolutely obliterate your ally's allies.\nThe Ugly  Very difficult for noobie players, or even people that know what their doing but haven't played in awhile, to... hate this word, MICROMANAGE  everything.   You've got so much you're going to have to put your attention on. Planetary defense is probably the biggest issue under the Micromanagement department. The Vasari have a ship that can be told to "Autoplace" mines. Something similar for planetary defense. I wish part of a planet's income was also stored as "defense" budget so you could place defenses around one planet without drawing out of your own resources. Because you're going to be scraping the bottom of the barrel just playing the game as is. Late game when you have all the money you could possibly imagine, it stops being a resource issue and becomes a management issue. Because you've gotta do it all manually. If it applied individually per planet, and each planet had it's own defense budget that built up over time, pulling out a defense would be a lot more feasible for EVERY planet in your domain. I suppose this is to make it so you don't turtle on every planet, and you need to concentrate your resources to defending the key points, like the planets you own that are next to enemy planets, or defending wormholes, the centre star, etc. It feels like you should be able to defend every planet equally simply because the options are there. But if you're fighting the AI, the AI is WAY better at Microing than any human player, and you WILL find defenses on every planet, and that's why this is so frustrating.\nOn The Fence  You'll control the battles by specifically saying which targets to attack, and with what, when to use abilities so on. But this hinges on whether or not you have something that can counter what the enemy is throwing at you. The only solution to fighting a Titan is either a fleet of capital ships or another Titan. Throwing the lesser ships (Frigates and Cruisers) at the larger ships (Capital Ships and Titans) is basically useless. This is entirely for balance issues. If you could build a bunch of crappy frigates and beat a captial ship, there'd by no point to building capital ships.\nThe biggest thing you'll control in a battle is when to retreat. Not bad, not good, this is stuff that's on the fence. There is depth to the battles, but once again this comes down to that word again... MICROMANAGEMENT. You can just Macro (I.E CTRL + A, and then attack) instead of Micro, but the best results come from Micro... once again, not bad, not good, this stuff is on the fence.\nNotes\nIt may look like this game has a lot of "bad" being shipped with it. It's really because there's SO MUCH to do, there is SO MUCH DEPTH to the game that this is really the best system that could go along with it. Note that I never offered points of improvement except to defence, because there isn't much that can be done to improve the series. The series has evolved from just "Sins of a Solar Empire" through multiple expansions like... entrenchment, diplomacy, which has added more (and for the better) to the game. The realty is, you are one person, and you can't run an empire with just one person... and that's the biggest strength and flaw to the game. You are one person that can manage an interstellar empire, the devs have done their absolute best work to make sure you can MANAGE your empire, but there is just SO MUCH to do...\n\nAnd that's why I love this game. Really, you could call "Sins of a Solar Empire" Galactic Empire Management Simulator, one that is rather serious, but a Simulator regardless. Because you'll be managing every aspect you can imagine.\n\n"Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion.

This game is a standalone expansion of the previous game Sins of a Solar Empire: Trinity.\n\nSins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion gameplay is exactly the same as the previous game but expanded in some ways. Each faction in Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion has been splitted into two, a loyalist faction and a rebel faction, each with their own unique background story and traits. Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion also introduce new mighty unit called Titan. Titan is unique with each faction. There is also smaller new ship, the corvette unit which is also unique with each faction. This add new elements of strategy and gameplay to the game. Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion also offer two new DLC, one of them contains new feature, the random events, which will affect your gameplay much.\n\nGraphics of Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion has also been improved. Weapons effect, ships boosters and many other space environment graphics are all enhanced, making the big space battles even more epic than ever. Ships and planets also have better texture now. The game still runs optimized despite all enhanced graphics but still unable to utilize more than 2GB of RAM. When the game run out of memory, most of the time it will crash, but it rarely happen unless you're using 3rd party modification.\n\nThere are some mods that making Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion even more fun and interesting, like the Star Trek Armada, changing the whole game universe into Star Trek Universe, Federations, Klingons and all.\n\nSins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is great standalone expansion pack. Great addition to Sins of a Solar Empire fans. I recommend this.\n\nRating 9/10","October 16, 2013","true","92.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Titled Rebellion, this third expansion comes in a new, expandalone format, and adds just about everything except actual rebellion. Silly developers!\n\nSins has aged well, partly because its only competitor, Sword of the Stars II, flopped harder than a snake slipping off a diving board, but also because its appeal is still intact. As you develop your empire, swinging from planet to planet, tumbling down the tech tree, stringing together fleets and levelling up your capital ships, the game simply gives you a bit too much to think about.\n\nItâs uncanny. As a beginner, youâll have your hands (and head) full developing trade routes and continuing the electric push of your culture across the solar system, perhaps with one eye on your prize fleet, making sure itâs still winning some 20-minute pitched battle. But experts will be kept just as busy micromanaging the powers on individual ships, perhaps leaping home to oversee the construction of a Maginot Line-like array of turrets, before snapping up the diplomacy menu to offer a job, a ceasefire, a demand, then back to the fight.\n\nSinsâ sweet spot is that it always threatens to overwhelm, but rarely does. This isnât the riptide real-time strategy of StarCraft II. Itâs more sedate than that. But the game simply has so much going on, its every element rewarding not just attention but obsession, that youâre able to sink into it like a hot bath. Want to fling armadas around as if they were plastic toys? Youâll have a great time. Want to orchestrate your fleets like an interplanetary Rommel? Youâll see the rewards instantly.\n\nWhich brings us to what Rebellion adds. Perhaps most notably, it still doesnât add a singleplayer campaign, leaving you to fool around either online or in the excellently robust skirmish mode. Which is fine. Thereâs also a whole new suite of tutorials, which prepare you for everything â except how to deal with this much content.\n\nSinsâ three relatively asymmetrical races have been further rent into Rebel and Loyalist variants, each of which holds a new teasing selection of powerful abilities and a unique Titan. Weâll get to those. Loyalist TEC, for example, are a turtleâs dream, with one tech that increases experience gained fighting in their own space and another that lowers the cost of the horrible Novalith Cannon (which lets them slam-dunk nukes into distant gravity wells). Meanwhile, the nomadic Vasari Loyalists gain the power to summon NPC vagabonds and devour planets like so many Mars Bars.\n\nThere are new corvettes and capital ships for each faction, too, but the Titans are the stars of the show. Monstrously expensive and perfectly suited to a long-form game like Sins, itâs likely the fiercest fighting these behemoths will see will be attacks by wary players on their sprawling dockyard before theyâre completed.\n\nAs with everything else in the game, however, they strike a thoughtful balance. Completing a Titan is by no means a âwinâ button, but the automated report that another player has finished one still instils a gentle dread.\n\nOutside of the lack of a singleplayer campaign, about the only criticism that could be levelled at Rebellion is that itâs not much of a looker anymore. But you know what? When you jump some 50 ships on top of an enemy fleet, announcing your presence in a flutter of missiles and hot burps of laser fire, you just canât tear your eyes away.","July 16, 2014","true","111.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

BUY IT. Like a great person and an ultimate memelord once said: "JUST DO IT!". This is an RTS video game which main goal is to rule a growing space empire. The game is filled with content, it features real time combat (the unit limit is seriously high, so the battles are not only challenging and exciting but also huge and spectacular) which requires input from the player since you can manage every single ship on the battlefield separately, especially capital ships that will level up after gaining enough XP points and require the player to put some input in the direction of where the upgrade points go. However the game is not only focused on combat unlike the majority of other RTS games with such massive battles. While the battle is going on you can just zoom out and control your empire, send reinforcements or either start an another battle in a different spot. As I mentioned before, not only you have to fight and conquer, but also do research, gather resources, manage the planetary and orbital infrastructure of each planet you own, run a diplomacy between you and other players, give missions to factions or pirates, bribe pirates to strike empires other than yours and do other stuff that a space emperor would do. The point is, there is so much content, such a huge game world (if you feel like a single solar system of 30+ planets isn't enough for you, there is an option to play on a map based on several solar system each one with tens of planets ) with so many planets/sectors to rule and various ways of victory (diplomatic,total annihilation etc.) that it's hard to put everything into a smal steam review. Even though it is an RTS game, the matches can stay up to several hours or days as it is in Civilization V. It makes the game a fun multiplayer production with an option to host a multiplayer lobby and save the game progress so it can get loaded next time you want to play, that's why the game plays the best if you have friends who are willing to play it with you.\nIn a nutshell - it is a fun RTS game with many gameplay possibilities and a great multiplayer module.

The original game was fantastic, and with Rebellion, comes even more fun! Take command of one of three factions, and choose whether you are a Loyalist or a Rebel. Each faction has their own backstory and reasons for why they are fighting, and the sins they are paying for.\n\nThe technology trees have been expanded ever so slightly, and the tech from before has been reworked. Perhaps you want to upgrade how effecient your mining is or maybe you want to start broadcasting how amazing your civilization is across space. Choose whether you want to upgrade your ships' weaponry or armor, to field more variations or ships, or build your defenses.\n\nSpeaking of ships, they have added in two new classifications: the Corvette and the Titan. The Corvette is a fast little attack ship, sporting a few weapons, and a debilitating effect. They take only a research upgrade to start producing. And then comes the Titan. These behemoths take several research upgrades, not-to-mention an arm and a leg worth of resources to start producing. You can only field one at a time, but these monsters are devastating.\n\nEach faction has one new capital ship as well, which can be of varying use in certain aspects of the game. The original five capital ships have been revamped, with their abilities being reworked and revamped. Not everything has been changed, but a few tweaks have been made, to make sure they are still viable and fun to use.\n\nThis is the only part that I still have a problem with: the planetary upgrades. Planets can be upgraded in a handful of different areas, and different types of planets can receive a different number of upgrades, up to a maximum of four. These upgrades can allow a larger planetary population or increasing the number of tactical (defensive structures and the like) or logistical (research platforms, broadcasting stations, shipyards). It could increase the health of the planet (and thus how much damage it can take from enemy bombardment), or explore the planet. This could lead to planetary anomalies that could be beneficial or penalize the planet, or even discover a long-lost artifact, which would have beneficial affects for your empire as a whole. The reason I have a problem with this is because it is too streamlined. Once a planet is upgraded, there is no reason to keep coming back to it, unless it is being attack.\n\nThat being said, do I recommend the game? Yes. Absolutely. Gameplay is almost never stale, as the game changes every time you start it again. Anyone that enjoys the aspect of large naval space engagements would positively love Sins of a Solar Empire. And with this 75% off deal going on for this weekend, I would jump at the opportunity.","June 5, 2014","true","82.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I started with the original game and have purchased each of it's successors and, or DLC's. I have never felt let down in any game from this gaming series. I've always enjoyed playing each and everyone of the releases. Many, many games have brought themselves into this 4X space genre and I've tried out many demos from the competition. I've also purchased many other games in this genre, yet to date none have compared to Sins of a Solar Empire, in my humble opinion. The gameplay is smooth and extremely beautiful, even when you zoom in as close as you can. And have literally hundreds to thousands of ships in the grips of warfare (including the AI or enemy player's ships). I highly recommend that you purchase the DLC, especially for this release. Because it brings a lot more options and most importantly; Tons mo' fun to the table.\n\nThere's also a lot of depth in this game, if you so choose to dig deeper. From planetary upgrades, fleet upgrades, starbases and the awe inspiring Titan Class. There's always something to do and MM is easily tamed if that's your play style, and the game moves fast or slow. You decide -- there are so many options before dropping into battle as to what could possibly happen. Don't like pirates? Fine, simply disable them or better yet choose a faction that harnesses the pirates to do your bidding. Don't like playing with diplomatic measures influencing the game? You can disable or bend these options to your will as well. Truly, the options are endless. This game gives you so much control, whether it be through the options menu and, or the faction you choose to play as. I could go on, but I think you have a firm grip on the gist of what I'm spraying.

These mods even have multiplayer capabilities so you can create scenarios fitting to the universes.\nAll in all I believe even without mods this game is an amazing experience which few games offer and would highly recomend it to anyone with an interest in sci/fi games and in strategy games in general.","December 16, 2015","true","79.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Rebellion adds many things to the game, but its primary additions are the Titans, which are massive Mothershipesque monstrosities which dwarf the capital ships.\n\nThere are still the three primary factions: Vasari, TEC, Advent. This game, however, splits those factions into Loyalist and Rebel factions that the player can choose. These factions diversify the choices and play styles of the factions. The Vasari are still, in general, very war and destruction focused (you get cool gravely voices and get to strip planets). The TEC are still pretty trade and defense focused. The Advent are still rather culture focused. The factions do add a little difference to the play style.\n\nThe primary reason to play this game is the feeling of power as you conquer planets and then galaxies. The game is very long with even a one galaxy game taking hours. It is loads of fun in multiplayer, but you might find that you have to dedicate an entire weekend to a good multi-galaxy 3-5 player game. My and my buds in college did this more often than we probably should have!\n\nThe story for this game is essentially the context of the races. Make up your own story! Are you the TEC turned aggressive? Do you want to be constantly quoting "Join the Unity" or "I am the Unity's Servant" with your friends? Play the Advent and be annoying! Are you the Vasari who have decided to like trade and culture (if so, you're playing them wrong. Play the advent). DO YOU WANT TO CONSUME ALL THE PLANETS? PLAY VASARI. For example: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=575349424\n\nSeriously though, get the game on sale. Force your friends to get the game. Practice more than them.

That kind of sucks but the gameplay makes up for it, there's a lot you can do once you start a game. The game tries to make diplomacy a big concept but fails because diplomacy can largely be ignored. At least for me, diplomacy could have been done better.\n\nIt comes with a "map editor." I use quotes because it's not really a map editor. It gives you a screen with various settings that you can modify and it auto-creates a map based on those settings. It's essentially just a fancy random map mode.\n\nNot really much else to say...

I have yet to complete very much research into the back story, and lore of each faction, but there is not much of a campaign to speak of either with the Game, so it's up to you to explore which faction you most identify with. There are Three primary Factions which are playable, while each Faction is divided into the primary Faction, and the Extremist Factions each providing their own unique bonuses and strategies. Did I mention there were Pirates in the game, and  they love to collect Bounty. You will have Tons of opportunities to explore the Game during Solo Play with a couple AI Enemies, I would highly encourage this to learn the Ropes of the Game before full immersion into a Multilayer Game. Have you ever felt like creating your own Galaxy, and then try to Conquer it in its entirety? You can do that with a decent Computer and Sins of a Solar Empire. Did I mention how great all the DLC Expansions compliment the Game, and allow for a much more diversified and unique Galaxy each time you begin a new Game? One time I thought it would be Awesome if I could Control an entire Fleet during a space battle after watching Star Wars for the first time in my life, after purchasing Sins of a Solar Empire, my Dreams became a Reality. Would you like your fellow Clan or Guild Members to hail you as the Galactic Emperor? This could be a Reality for you too with this Game, a little practice, and possibly a couple personal pointers from yours truly.. One aspect that I felt was missing from the Game was the ability to Control each Ship yourself, which I think would be fricken Awesome. Ultimately the Game will be as vast as your Imagination, and Free Time will allow; Many games can be finished within Two to Three hours, I also have some on-going Games which might never end. If I were to describe the Game to you from here on through the rest of this Review, I would make sure to include the Fact that you start out with a Home Planet, and through Military Skill, Intelligent Research, swift Expansion to surrounding Planets, dominating your Local Star, Cultural Assimilation, Diplomatic Relations, and Teamwork, you gradually Conquer the Solar System, Planet by Planet. You will eradicate all Competition, punishing Pirates, or placing Bounty on other Players, hiring said Pirates to do your Dirty Work. Did I mention that you can develop each Planet, and harvest the necessary Resources to Build up and Expand your Armada, and Empire? I heard that the Black Market can always provide a quick Economic Stimulus when you're in a Financial Bind, I've never uttered a more true to Life Statement. Don't forget to do your Research, because there are Multiple Tech Trees to Explore and unlock, which provide great Offensive, or Defensive Bonuses, as well as â¥â¥â¥â¥ that helps your Empire expand. Your Fleet may consist of a vast array of unique Ships, each with their own Strengths, depending on your Research Levels, you can quickly Constrict your Opponents to close Proximity Conflicts. One other thing I thought to mention would be the great Modding Community, remember when I was so into Star Wars earlier? There's a Mod for that... Yea when I think of the ultimate Futuristic Space Real Time Strategy Game, Sins of A Solar Empire has become my number One, so go ahead and purchase this game next time you see it on sale, because it is a Great Game, which I feel I have gotten the value of what I had paid for it initially, Ten Fold after my First successful Galactic Conquest.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/204880/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","For a space RTS game, this is definitely where it's at. Although it doesn't hone the capabilities of taking control of a single ship, it does give a good space fun their fill of fun. Be careful as you can get caught and quickly start pouring hours into single player missions or playing against your friends online! If you are looking for me to expand on the personal story of Sins of a Solar Empire I cannot do it. Why? I don't have enough background information to tell you exactly what the story is but I can tell you how the game holds up! Even if you're not a hardcore space fan, you could most likely easily put 10 hours into the game. This may be in part in how the game develops to play style.\n\nSins of a Solar Empire is described as an 4X type of game (explore, expand, exploit and exterminate). There is quite a bit to do and manage. To begin, there are three races that the player is able to choose from : the (industrial) TEC, the (psychics) Advent and the (alien zergish looking) Vasari. Each race has it's own unique distinctions and units but all sort of share the same build options regarding ships and buildings alike. The TEC (human race) is not as good technologically as the other races but is good at poking away at opponents slowly (attrition warfare). The Advent race has great energy weapons but lack armor and prefer shields. They also can use their cultural influence on other planets in an attempt to shift opinion. The Vasari beat both the humans and the Advent regarding their technological and ship abilities. However, these high quality ships come at a steep price!\n\nThe game play itself is actually pretty good. It's easy to keep track of what's going on from planet to planet and they made it extremely easy to upgrade/build. If you are wanting to upgrade an aspect of a planet (say civilian infrastructure, emergency shelters, exploring more of the planet and (not limited to) industry or social focus), it can be done easily. Managing planets was made with ease while managing fleets takes a bit of work. There are lot of commands in games that the keyboard can take care of. It will take a while to figure out what is what but as long as you know what the icons mean, you're gold. Research and diplomacy can be taken care of by clicking the tabs up top. Research is broken into a few categories in which focuses on either military, defense, diplomatic, civilian infrastructure and fleet upgrades. New units, abilities or even additional damage can added to your arsenal. Be wary though! To create capitol ships or titan units (mega ships), you will need "command" staff and will have to upgrade not a unit amount, but the command slot amount.\n\nI'm a bit confused regarding single player as there doesn't seem to be a campaign mode. Rather, it seems they took the approach of single individual missions against the AI. This might irritate a lot of players but may also entice a lot of players into playing single missions. Multiplayer saved games are a bit tricky (see : link discussion). All players must have their own save file but the save file cannot be sent player to player (as one player may be using your race/units). The diplomacy portion of the game is a little weary as well. It's good but nothing too outstanding. Missions can be given to factions and vice versa (as well as trade options and the sort). Completing these missions reflects on your relations with factions. Pirates can also be hired within the game in case you don't want to attack your opponent directly. It can cost you a pretty penny though!\n\nThere are a few things you can tweak in-game considering winning conditions. Default mission settings uses domination, which means that you basically have to take over the map. There is a diplomatic victory in which you need to acquire the most diplomatic points to win. Research victory where (obviously) you need to complete the most research or reach a specific tier. There is an occupation victory in which special militia will keep spawning at a certain planet and players must control (occupy) this planet for a certain amount of time. Reaching this time means victory. There are other winning conditions such as capitol planet and capitol ship in which both (or one - your choice) have to stay alive. If your capitol planet becomes occupied, you lose. If your capitol ship gets destroyed, you lose. Within this menu you can also change how many planets are within the map and starting conditions. They give you a decent amount of options to customize your game so you can enjoy how you wish.\n\nThe game's currency system is quite simple and has some nice additions. Coins are your basic income and will need it to buy majority of things. (NOTICE : if you are losing coins and do not know why, you do not have enough civilian infrastructure on your planets)! Crystals are the next and finally metal. Metal and crystal are harvested from asteroids and can be traded if you build a trade system (increasing your economy). Metal and crystal can be sold or bought. They attempted an interactive market where the prices will drop and rise. The game will give you a small heads-up but it's always a good idea to keep an eye on the prices.\n\nThe visuals themselves are actually decently good. They is a lot of attention to detail and most phaser/ion cannon shots are noticeable. Ships taking damage is also apparent as well as when ships attack planets (you can see mini explosions on the surface)! In addition, you can see traffic moving about the planet and cities. Sounds are pretty good (explosion sounds could vary a bit) and you can hear ships jump from planet to planet. The dialogue in game is good but as most RTS games, you'll start hearing the same voices in your head.\n\nOverall, a pretty good space RTS game. I would recommend it for die-hard space fans and would recommend the casual gamer to buy on sale so there is no love lost. After playing for 10+ hours and playing different game modes (victory conditions), it is beginning to be redundant. Like I said, I can see a lot of gamers immersing themselves into this game. I would love to see some individual control given to the player as well as maybe adding a campaign? All the space RTS stuff is right, maybe it's now time to take it an extra step?\n\n\nRATING : 7.5/10\n\n\nScreenShots : (to come)\nWhat one Titan looks like\n\nWhat another Titan looks like\n\nSome levels have a distinct color that'll hit your eyes consistently\n\nThere is a magic button you should be aware of","April 12","true","19.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Absolutely gorgeous graphics, gameplay is perfect for new video gamers, as well as long time gamers. It has minimalistic control, so you dont need to micro everyone and everything. However, if you so desire, this is an option, and will greatly improve results from battles. All factions are pretty much balanced, however they do depend on your playstyle. All races have a few OP researches they can do at the end. Last but not least, the modding community. It's absolutely stunning. There are mods for almost everything for this game, and more are on the way. Only downside I see is possibly price, however that does not factor into the actual gameplay. I give this a 10/10.

If I had to say one thing that was bad about this, it would be the flower production. I liked how the space theme fits very well in this game - you send flowers to others in space and they send some back to you but I find it hard to believe that you'd need so much resourses to make flowers.

Sins of a Solar Empire is brilliant. 9/10\n\nThe gameplay mechanics do take experience to master, but that's all part of what makes the game so wonderful; there are so many aspects of gameplay to take into consideration when you are in a match, such as culture, research topics, and etcetera. If you think that all you have to do to prevail in a match of Sins is to build a thousand ships and spam orbital cannons, you are sorely mistaken.\n\nOne thing that appeals to me personally about Sins is the fact that, right from the beginning, you have to meticulously plan out each detail of your empire's expansion, taking into consideration events that could potentially happen hours later.\n\nThat planet with only one phase lane leading into enemy territory? Chances are your enemy will eventually try to punch through. You'll need to plan for that.\n\nThe world on the other side of the map that's just starting to produce culture? It will spread to your planets quickly. You'll need to plan for that.\n\nThat TEC Loyalist player on the other side of the map whose planet pings up for a second with a superweapon alert? You'll especially need to plan for that.\n\nThe one and only downside for me about Sins is, and I'm sure this is a common one, there's no campaign! The franchise has gone into a good deal of detail creating a backstory, seriously, there's a whole bunch of story content out there. What I would really like to see is an actual in-game campaign in which you can follow one of the three main empires on their quests within this storyline. Another little want of mine is to have a campaign constructor. That would be amazing. If these things were there, a 10/10 game.\n\nIt's pretty much impossible to get bored of Sins, each game turns out differently from the last. But if, however, you somehow manage to get bored, there's but one thing for that: mods. This game has a Star Trek mod, and subsequently has my seal of approval.\n\nThis game is amazing. I myself have had endless hours of fun with Sins, and reccommend this entirely to everybody. Get this game right now.","October 6, 2014","true","400.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The online scene is a little dead, but that doesnt take away from the fact that this is a fantastic game.\n\nThere are 3 things that set this apart from most other RTS's I have played:\n1) The diplomacy is challenging as you have to build a relationship with a faction. Unlike other games with diplomacy mechanics, you really have to work at it.\n2) The resources are scarce. It's not like Starcraft where you can just start mass-producing probes/drones/scvs to boost your economy intake. You need to manage resources and take advantage of the refining boosts you get through research.\n3) The research tree. This is probably one of the most standard mechanic of any good RTS, and because of that I have seen some terrible tech trees. This game however has a balanced tech tree that allows for a little variability in expanding and is grouped into nice little sections for easier maintenance. I like this a LOT.\n\nAside from these three things, the game is also visually appealing, with an interesting (if a bit cliche) backstory and lots of available strategies for play. The only true downsides are the somewhat annoying and repetitive unit voices, the rather repetitive soundtrack, and the steep, steep learning curve.\n\nIn any case, I give this a 9/10. Excellent game to pick up if you dont mind spending an hour or 2 per match.","June 28, 2014","true","83.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You need to manage resources and take advantage of the refining boosts you get through research.\n3) The research tree. This is probably one of the most standard mechanic of any good RTS, and because of that I have seen some terrible tech trees. This game however has a balanced tech tree that allows for a little variability in expanding and is grouped into nice little sections for easier maintenance. I like this a LOT.\n\nAside from these three things, the game is also visually appealing, with an interesting (if a bit cliche) backstory and lots of available strategies for play. The only true downsides are the somewhat annoying and repetitive unit voices, the rather repetitive soundtrack, and the steep, steep learning curve.\n\nIn any case, I give this a 9/10. Excellent game to pick up if you dont mind spending an hour or 2 per match.","June 28, 2014","true","83.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I watched the trailer, and was bored half way through.. But, it does boast some impressive stuff sooo 'Lets watch some in-game vids on youtube' I thought to myself.\n\n2 mins in, I had purchased a 4 pack for me and some buddies. I was actually sat on the edge of my sofa waiting for the game to install.. It looked complex from what I could see.. but hey, that makes the game better!\n\nNow as much as I want to recommend the tutorials..  it did take me 3 hours to run through all the tutorials, just because they're are as boring as hell to do. They did however prepare me for some basic gameplay so in I jumped ready for some action!\n\nNow skipping past my first few games, or the learning phase, as I call it. I put myself against 3 Ai and no word of a lie, it lasted over 9 hours. The game took so many turns it was untrue.. one moment I was winning hands down, then it all collapsed around me as my culture was taken over! I then brought it back again only to have the Ai turn things around again.. It all sounds horrible but infact it was incredible fun! For a game to be so well built that you can turn your hand to something different to bring it all back again is great.\n\nMultiplayer is also great fun.. you can team up or go FFA.. Even during FFA you can raise your diplomacy with your friends, and/or your enemies. While your friend and you are teaming together to bring an enemy faction down, you can be employing other races to form against your friend, leaving them defenceless for when you decide to declare war again ;)\n\nFor fans of older games like 'Birth of the Federation' 'Star wars Supremacy' 'Homeworld' or Civilisation, then be prepared to lose yourself inan absolutely incredible stratagy game!\n\nI was only made aware of this game due to a steam sale, but it is well worth the Â£29.99 price tag.","April 18, 2014","true","86.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Including ships that could take on full fleets by themselves. And sent them to the planet. When they arrived, a giant â¥â¥â¥â¥off space station, armed to the bloody teeth, began slaughtering my fleet from the bottom up, first the corvettes, then the frigates, then the cruisers, etc. Then their titan warped in to engage my own, and with that, I had to order my last few ships into retreat. Only my titan managed to, on about 1% hp, limp back to my forward base, the enemy fleet right behind it.\n\nThen I got mad and fired my two planet-destroyer nuclear cannons hidden on the other side of the star system as a backup plan, in case the glorious frontal assault didn't work, and genocided the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of them, destroying an entire culture in just 2 shots.\n\n8/10 would space again\n\nActual review: Large scale, slooooow paced RTS with some nice space battles, easy to use interface (one you learn where everything is), some nice variety in the factions, and an interesting dynamic with the neutral fleets of militia and pirates that will launch their own periodic assaults on your worlds and trade routes. Graphics understandably look a little rough up close, and it requires a significant time investment per game, and the ability to form fleet formations would be nice, but overall, a damn solid space RTS.\n\nThink of a mix between Civ/similar and Supreme Commander/similar.

So, the start of the game tends to be a little tedious.  To get around that though, just play different factions.  Otherwise, I love ramping up the difficulty of the game to make it a nearly impossilbe challenge to win.  I play this game all of the time and I have yet to tire of it.","October 14, 2015","true","198.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Everything from the voice acting to the UI changes with each faction and the special abilities of each really gives a flavor to playing each faction.\n- Truly customizable fleets. Every ship/cruiser has a special ability that is further customized to the faction you are playing. Ever wanted a fleet that could push enemy ships away? A ship that can draw aggro? A ship that takes control of other units? It's a lot of fun.\n- Extremely good pacing. I felt like I could actually finish a game with my friends but it isn't so fast that you feel rushed or overwhelmed.\n- If you play through the tutorials, you have a good enough grasp of the game to enjoy the game, but the game actually has a lot of depth to explore to make more intricate strategies\n- Beautiful graphics for the ships and planets. I wish it was easier to play with your ships actually visible and not icons, but I love the amount of detail when you have time to zoom in and watch a battle up close.\n- Pirates are bad â¥â¥â¥. Whether you are fighting them or using them against people. I love that you can physically hunt down the pirate bases and get some well earned payback.\n\nCons\n- Diplomacy still seems somewhat clunky to me. Instead of starting in a cease fire with everyone, everyone pretty much starts in a cold war. Trying to contact someone means dodging their ships as they try to destroy you and hoping your envoys can survive long enough to make it to a cease fire. The missions are a great idea but are hard to utilize since they usually are "attack this person we don't like" with no consideration of your relationship with them or even if you know where they are!\n- The victories could be expanded upon for more unique victories. Most victories revolve around going to war at the moment despite having a highly developed culture, economic, and diplomatic system.\n- With so many good strategy games out now, I feel like $40 is not a very competitive price.\n\nThis definitely a game to lunge at if you ever catch it on sale but, if you don't mind the price, I think you will get your money's worth in playtime.","February 23","true","16.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are enough different methods you can use to get there, earlygame strats mostly revolve around either getting a fast fleet out to harass enemies or expanding as fast as possible to secore more income. Midgame is where all the big fleet engagements start, with fleets of around 30 ships on each side. balancing production with research and your spead of culture is  difficult, as lagging behind in any one of these will make the lategame painful.

First off, the time listed played, is one match + the tutorial.  I played only one single player map.  The smallest one.  The time it took me to finish it was over 8 hours.  Again this was the first single player map and listed as tiny.\n\nNow I will admit.  Part of that was cause I was still getting use to the game.  I also kinda limited my self to only upgrading war and defensive upgrades.  Leaving out anything that was trade or peace related.  This makes it hard cause those upgrades I did not use would help capture some planet types, give better material gathering, give more money, and allow peaceful relations with others in the system so that they did not attack you or even might help ya.\n\nSo ya, 8 hours for one tiny map.\n\nThis game is fun for anyone who like strategy and long game play.  Do not get this game thinking it will be a quick run.  There are ways to change the victory setting and not sure how the competitive play fairs.  I would imagine there might be some ways to make it go faster.\n\nAlso, as far as I can see.  There is no storyline or quest line.  This is not like Starcraft.  You are not doing RTS with a rich story about 3 different races.  Your basically playing a glorified chess game.  A MASSIVE, BEAUTIFUL, not really that close to chess, chess game.\n\nI was listening to a coworker talk about it and the vids I saw made it look good enough to try.  It is, but it is really only good for eating up your time.  Need something to just throw countless hours at were there is no story and just plotting and building your forces in hopes you can take out your enemies.  Then go for it.\n\nThough if you are not absolutely sure then do what I did and get it at 75% or more off.","May 26","true","15.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are hundreds and hundreds of hours worth of gameplay sitting right there waiting for you to buy it. At first, you start off at one planet, your capital planet, and you working on your economy and researching as much as you can. You send off small fleets to neighboring planets to gain control of them and wipe out the garrisons. This cycle continues for around 20 minutes, where you slowly expand your control and research tons of new ships and technology. Eventually, you are able to amass HUGE fleets and hunt down the hostile faction. This is just a small example of how incredibly fun the gameplay is.

It is a futuristic, space themed strategy game that expands many solar systems and you can colonise everythings, except for the stars, as long as you have the proper research.\nThe longer you play, the easier it gets, but at the same time, it also gets harder and the dificulty setting increases (as usual). But the jump in dificulty is amazing as you try to play on the highest setting.\nThere are people online that will ever tear you up at every chance the get, so get your economy going and making your fleet of ships something to be feared.","May 5","true","35.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It excels in so many ways itâs difficult to narrow them all down, but in short, its main pull is that it provides the depth and time not seen in many of the other RTS games out there. That being said, the games in Sins tend to take anywhere from 40 minutes, to 4 hours, so anyone who wants a shorter, more fast paced experience should look elsewhere.\n\nOn a very important side note, the multitude of mods out there can REALLY improve the experience. Three I'd personally recommend are: Sins of a Galactic Empire (A Star Wars based mod), Enhanced 4X, and Sins of the Prophets (Halo based).\n","December 10, 2013","true","348.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

There are so many little things that come together so seamlessly that to describe them all in detail would be like writing a novel, and I would not be suprised if the developers at Stardock had writen a novel about this game; it is certainly worthy of one.\n\nThe many different aspects of the game make it a new experience every playthrough with scaling difficulties to pander to the most elite RTS strategy buffs out there.

Whether it is wiping an entire race from it's existence, or building a giant cannon that shoots the image of god to an enemy home world, either way it's really fun.  You get to choose between three factions, each containing the Loyalists(True Empire) or the Rebels, with various ways of winning the game.\n\nThe factions are and contain the following empires:\nT.E.C. : Loyalists and Rebels\nVasari: Loyalists and Rebels\nAdvent:Loyalists and Rebels\n\nEach faction has their own personal upgrades that shared between the the two empires in that faction, along  with their own personal ships, star bases, culture, and more. And depending the empire you choose you have to use different victory options and strategies. And one common thing that all players have to deal with are space pirates. Although they are annoying, they can be dealt with pretty easily especially late game. Your currency for all empires are called credits, along with metal and crystals. In order to have a good functioning empire you need all the three in order to purchase ships, research new technologies, and to grow.\n\nPositives:\nIntelligent A.I. (especially in combat)\nDetailed ships,planets, and structures\nAllows mods (Star Trek, Star Wars, Battle Star Galactica,etc)\nHigh replayability\nEasy to learn with helpful tutorial\n\n\nNegatives:\nShips and structures can sometimes use auto use (Which makes them use a special ability) even after disabled\nPirates generally attack only one empire the whole game, very hard to pay off\nConstant connection and save problems when playing online\nConstant supervision of planets, ships,etc\n\nThat is all I can really remember at this time, note that this review is somewhat incomplete due to my bias opinion and my inexperience in the game. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys awesome space battles, hardcore strategy, and management.\n\n\n\n","May 28, 2015","true","46.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I saw the trailer and thought, "Wow this is pretty cool looking I think I'll get it." What it turned out to be was the best descision of my gaming life. I started up the game and playedthe tutorials to get used to the gameplay. The tutorials were very user friendly in my opinion and the game have easy to grasp concepts while always having something new for me to find about the gameplay. I started a game on a tiny map and played until I won. Only then did I realize that I just played for 4 hours straight. The game really grasps your imaginiation and does not limit what you can do in the game. If you want to go on the offensive go for it, The defensive? Do that also! But your not only limited to this you are able to do diplomatic solutions and trade during the game with other players. Not only all of this but this game has one the best modding communities I have ever seen. There are so many great mods out there for this game that are constantly being made and updated. A few of my favorites are Star Trek Armada 3, Sins of the Prophets, and Sins of a Galactic Empire. All of these great mods have dedicated modders that are able to answer your questions at any point and this game has a loyal fan base. After all of my playing, winning, and losing only then did I realize I did not know anything about the storyline. When I read the wiki on it I was amazed and the amount of lore this game has accumalated over the different games and after reading it I see the game in whole new light. I have about 200 hours logged and I am planning to log another 200.","November 26, 2014","true","342.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ding760/recommended/204880/","ding760","Opulent Omega","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ding760/","241 products in account","An unprecedentedly complex strategy game that has sucked an impressive amount of my time into its machinations.\n\nAs a fervent player of strategy games, I know more than most about the quality and standard of modern strategy games. Thus, it was to my pleasure to find that the gameplay of this game took me completely by surprise. When I purchased this game (due to a passing recommendation by a friend) I was expecting a mediocre 'annihilate-and-win' type of strategy game. What I found instead was a game that truly catered for just about any type of strategy player. One can win via a multiple of ways spanning from cultural domination to research to the common exterminate victory to name just a few. The cultural element of the game was a particularly impressive feature. As a strategist who prefers to punch my enemies into submission, I realized that the threat posed by a culturally superior race only too late in my first few games, where I believed I was winning the game through annihilation. Hence, unlike most strategy games, those who prefer to fortify and dig into their defences can technically still win the game without firing a single shot into the enemy ranks.\n\nThe resource accumilation and the ship upkeep features tends to keep most players in check, ensuring that no particular player can expand so quickly that he should overwhelm a coalition of players teaming up against him. This is a neat feature, as it forces players to think cunningly, lest too many of his enemies turn against him united in hate or paranoia.\n\nAmongst other notable features, I also found the time taken to travel between planets to be a key feature of this game. I had not originally known that travelling between say... 4 planets would take a decent amount of time. This means by the time my main fleet arrives to defend a planet under siege, it has probably already been raised to the ground. Hence, players are forced to pre-empt incoming attacks or opt to divide and conquer.\n\nThe multiplayer experience is quite enjoyable as this game seems to have a relatively small but extremely friendly following. I was pleasantly surprised to find there are plenty of new players to the multiplayer experience as well as veterans who can teach a newcomer a thing or two.\n\nOverall, Sins of a Solar Empire ranks very, very highly amongst my favourite strategy games. While the visuals of the game is not entirely awe-inspiring, it is very obvious the developers paid a significant portion of their time working on the mechanics of the game. I am happy to say that personally for me, their hard work has paid off and left a very satisfied player in their wake.\n\nOverall Score: 9/10 - Extremely satisfying to play, would highly recommend.","January 26, 2014","true","130.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Extremely high replay value.\n\nBack in the day, I played a game called Pax Imperia and its sequel Eminent Domain. In many ways, Sins of a Solar Empire looks, feels, and plays like the successor to these games.\n______________________________________\n\nPros:\nâ¢ Tutorials are fairly short and adequately teach gameplay.\nâ¢ Many AI difficulty settings means the game will continue to be challenging for experienced players.\nâ¢ Autosave feature is unobtrusive. Autosave feature keeps a full-game history, allowing you to go back to any point.\nâ¢ 6 different victory types which can selectively be turned off/on.\nâ¢ Good soundtrack. Almost all voiceovers are well done.\nâ¢ Very large selection of pre-made maps, can randomly generate maps of any size, and comes with a map designer.\nâ¢ Each race features a completely unique tech tree and set of units. Large selection of unit types each with their own skills.\nâ¢ Diplomacy system is understandable and works well.\nâ¢ With the amount of customization present, it's likely the next release in this series will be out long before you are bored with this game.\nâ¢ Map navigation is easy and intuitive.\n______________________________________\n\nCons:\nâ¢ While the background universe Ironclad Games has developed is cool, there is no "story mode."\nâ¢ No customization of races or factions (one of my favorite features from Eminent Domain).\nâ¢ One voiceover is not very good and it annoys me every time I hear it.\nâ¢ Tech trees can be slightly overwhelming on the first couple games.\nâ¢ I wish it had more cosmetic options (such as changable ship skins, more portraits, etc).\nâ¢ Hotkeys are difficult to learn.\n______________________________________\n\nOther Comments:\nâ¢ DRM is nothing to worry about, just a 30-second product registration.\nâ¢ Seriously, play the tutorials.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BMEhybrid/recommended/204880/","BMEhybrid","Archibald Von HallstrÃ¶m","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BMEhybrid/","133 products in account","As a fan of the Sci-Fi genre I love everything that involves massive starship battles, and Sins of a Solar Empire have always delivered on that front, Rebellion brings diffrant factions to the table, it splits the three main factions into six factions, one loyal and one radical faction. The gameplay is much like in the old games, a real time strategy where the goal is to fight it out among the diffrant maps and planets. the maps are usally split up into a number of solar systems, on some maps they are connected by wormholes or you can reach each of the solar systems by traveling by your local Star. each solar system consist of a number off planets that you can colonise, some reqiure a bit of research to anable them to be colonised, while astroid belts can't be colonised at all.\n\nEach planet ( depending on the kind of planet, and the ammount of research made) will allow you to produce a number of buildings, such as two kinds of tech labs, one to research defensive and offensive tech for your empire, while the other lab focuses on the economic and diplomatic side of your empire, this will allow for diffrant strategies and a bit on empire planning. then you have the standard Ship factories, one will produce small to medium ships while the other one will construct your capital ships, the core of any armada. These Ships will need research to unlock while the capital ships will require you to research fleet logistics, a sort of supply system were every level of research will unlock more ship supplies and more captains for your capital ships. After these two we have the largest ship your faction can construct, these are faction and race specified, meaning that every faction have their own "Titan" as they are called, while the capitalships and lesser ships are race based. These titans require lots of research and will take quite some time to construct, that said, these ships will more then often decide the outcome of any battle. There is also the possiblity to construct "Trade ports", "media huts" and "refineries" to generate credits or influense the planets around your solar system and generate extra amounts of crystal and metal. Of course the game also allow you to bunker up your planets with large amounts of diffrant defences, all from large Starports, Mines, turrets, Warp disrupters and a special race super weapon.\n\nNow moving on to resurses, there are three resurses that are used in the game, Credits that are generated from your planets and ammount of people you have living on the actuall planets, then you have crystals and metal, these two will require you to construct asteroid mines where ever you might find them, some planets might only contain crystal while others only contain Metal so deciding what planet to colonise is again quite important.\n\nThe game also futures a bit of rouge covert bits, were you can send pirates ( that said, this is a game optiuon that can be turned off before the start of the game) to harrass the planets of your enemy, these will grow in strenght over time and can be quite hard to take out early in the game because of the ammount of defences around their base. There is also a black market where you can trade crystal and metal for credits and vice verse, this works with supply and demand and some times the market for metal can crash because of the ammount of people trying to sell their large amount of metal for a bit of credits.\n\nThe factions in the game are just as in the old games TEC, Advent and the Vasari Empire. These are then spilt up into two diffrant factions within the Race, each of them have their special Titan and each also have special powers that the other faction and race can't research. For example the Vasari loyalists can research a special upgrade so that their warp gates ( that allow them to move around to other warp gates constructed around the solar system) can summon the Vasari dark fleet that will assist the defence of their planet.\n\nThe game is to me a balanced strategy game that in my opinion futures a large amount of content, that said, this game is made for multiplayer as the campaign is non existing. That said this game is at its best when you can gather a group of friends and just battle it out across a large space battlefield. I give it a 10/10 for a very polished and fun strategy game and one of the best space real time strategy games on the market.","August 7, 2014","true","61.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However when SoaSE : R was put on a hefty sale, I decided to do some research and after watching some YT videos of mods and other awesome moments, and with copious positive reviews both on and offline, I decided to pick it up. I'll say right now, that it's still a very fiddly game, but I've sunk about 2 evenings worth of time playing it and even more time thinking about it. It's easily one of the most proficient games when it comes to Fleet management and empire building in a Sci-Fi genre. Solid mechanics, excellent economy system and fantastic battle simulations (could still be better with more animated battles, but the particle effects and light shows are still great to watch). If you need a good comparison of a game, think Supreme Commander fused with Civilization.\n\nDefinitely worth a buy. =D","June 12, 2014","true","64.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is highly addictive and takes a lot of time to get into the swing of things but you won't notice, you will be too busy exploring Feros, while defending Gateway and sending an envoy to Lexmada at the same time! The game plays much like a space orientated RTS with a top-down camera as default, you can change the visuals in a fullly flexible camera and the zoom can be looking at a shole solar system or a single planet.\n\nThe game itself features 3x factions, split into 2x subfactions each. There are a variety of ships & buildings available, several research trees per faction and hours of gameplay just there alone. You can chose to conquer your system with diplomacy as you explore and develop your planets or simply wage war on everyone, choice is yours. The gameplay is quite slow but can be adjusted in realtime.\n\nSome of the achievements are time consuming but keep some replayability in the game, the online multiplayer requires an Ironclad Online account but you can organsie a match in the chat room and the players there will usually stick throughout the whole session. There are ~400 active players at any given time.\n\nSome drawbacks are the games engine, it isn't optimised well for modern hardware so no matter what you're playing on, if you're waging war in a system with 100+ planets, after some time the game will beging to stutter - if you have low / modest hardware you will see this much sooner. It doesn't have an overall negative impact on the game but should be taken into account. Personally, I wouldn't let it spoil the overall experience that is Sins, this is a game that holds hours of play and while it looks very complicated the tutorials will hold your hand through the basics and from there the game takes no time to get involved with.\n\nA secondary gripe is the lack of a single player story, the intro video looks like it is geared for one but it is not present in this game. I'd still recommend it any day.","January 4, 2014","true","65.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Few games have such a high level of replayability and sheer fun factor but Sins manages it with ease. Each faction is well balanced and unique, the split between Loyalists and Rebels is a nice touch, perhaps there could have been slightly more to seperate the two but it's not a pressing issue and they are unique enough.\n\ngraphically the game looks impressive, models and textures are of high quality so people who enjoy their shiny games won't be dissapointed. The only particular issue with the game is the engine Ironclad used, it's very old and only uses a single core. Sadly this means no matter how beastly your rig is, during large battles with big fleets the game WILL stutter.\n\nIf that doesn't put you off then Sins is well worth a buy, plus the game has modding support with a very active modding community that have made some fantastic mods. While you may not personally wants Sins itself (but it is good so do try it out) there are well developed mods including Halo, Mass Effect and Stargate and a Homeworld mod.\n\nJust for refference I have an i7-3930k clocked at 3.8ghz and the game still loses massive frames and stutters duing big battles. So do keep in mind the engine limitations...I wouldn't mind a Rebellion Remastered on a better engine Ironclad.

Even as late as 2014, I might call it the best game since Civ4 came out in 2005. The basic setup is almost cliche: three factions, three types of resources, spend those resources on tech/buildings/units, kill enemy. However, it distinguishes itself in several ways to become a truly great game. First, you play at both a macro and micro level and everything between, and the game somehow makes this seemingly incompatible mix of scales work unbelievably well. Second, unlike many RTS it is not all about APM, as it proceeds at a pace where deliberative thought is possible. It is an RTS that might appeal to TBS players. Third, despite the slower pace there's still plenty to do, because it does a great job in presenting the user with interesting meaningful and situationally appropriate choices, from where and how to spend resources, how aggressively to push, and with what ships. You're constantly making choices, and the game somehow manages that precise balance only the greatest games do of making you never quite comfortable with that choice.\n\nOne flaw: The learning curve is steep without a campaign. It's not a complex game, really. It's easily playable with nothing more than a mouse, after all. However, it takes a while to appreciate that and let the true depth of the game shine through. I understand things more or less well now, but it was a hard slog. (To save time: Read GoaFan77's guide, every last word of it. I didn't have that advantage when I started.)","July 13, 2014","true","201.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mercianix/recommended/204880/","mercianix","Mercianix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mercianix/","411 products in account","Sins has been my first look into a 4X game, it's definitely not going to be my last.\n\nThe game is a standalone expansion to the original "Sins of a Solar Empire" which previous to Rebellion came in a Trinity pack. The game is highly addictive and takes a lot of time to get into the swing of things but you won't notice, you will be too busy exploring Feros, while defending Gateway and sending an envoy to Lexmada at the same time! The game plays much like a space orientated RTS with a top-down camera as default, you can change the visuals in a fullly flexible camera and the zoom can be looking at a shole solar system or a single planet.\n\nThe game itself features 3x factions, split into 2x subfactions each. There are a variety of ships & buildings available, several research trees per faction and hours of gameplay just there alone. You can chose to conquer your system with diplomacy as you explore and develop your planets or simply wage war on everyone, choice is yours. The gameplay is quite slow but can be adjusted in realtime.\n\nSome of the achievements are time consuming but keep some replayability in the game, the online multiplayer requires an Ironclad Online account but you can organsie a match in the chat room and the players there will usually stick throughout the whole session. There are ~400 active players at any given time.\n\nSome drawbacks are the games engine, it isn't optimised well for modern hardware so no matter what you're playing on, if you're waging war in a system with 100+ planets, after some time the game will beging to stutter - if you have low / modest hardware you will see this much sooner. It doesn't have an overall negative impact on the game but should be taken into account. Personally, I wouldn't let it spoil the overall experience that is Sins, this is a game that holds hours of play and while it looks very complicated the tutorials will hold your hand through the basics and from there the game takes no time to get involved with.\n\nA secondary gripe is the lack of a single player story, the intro video looks like it is geared for one but it is not present in this game. I'd still recommend it any day.","January 4, 2014","true","65.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Adding in new ships and splitting each faction into loyalists and rebels, the game brings many enjoyable elements alongside the original game and other two expansions, graciously included in the stand alone title. For fourty dollars, the game is well worth it, as the replayability value is very high. Every game is different, especially with the semi-active multiplayer community. All in all, the game is worth the value, and I would recommend buying it if you're a fan of 4X games or RTS games.","April 19, 2014","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although initially the game might have a steep learning curve once learned it gives great pleasure and infinite hours of fun.\n\nPros\n+ Impressive graphics for a real time strategy game\n+ Three different races with different playstyles\n+ Hours of sandbox campaign fun (against AI or other players online)\n+ Tech research tree different for each faction\n+ Spectacular space battles\n+ Great music\n\nCons\n- Lack of campaign mode (your campaign is what you do in sandbox mode so you need some immagination)\n- More in depth planetary administration would be nice\n- Lack of an in depth lore for the game\n\nOverall for me is a solid 8/10. This game really need just more features and variety to shine. DLCs help in this regard however more are needed. A campaign is a must here.\nIn conclusion should you buy this game? Yes if you like real time strategy set in space and have one or two good friends to play the game with. You won't be disappointed. Buy it with all the DLCs though to have a complete experience.","June 25, 2014","true","15.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is highly addictive and takes a lot of time to get into the swing of things but you won't notice, you will be too busy exploring Feros, while defending Gateway and sending an envoy to Lexmada at the same time! The game plays much like a space orientated RTS with a top-down camera as default, you can change the visuals in a fullly flexible camera and the zoom can be looking at a shole solar system or a single planet.\n\nThe game itself features 3x factions, split into 2x subfactions each. There are a variety of ships & buildings available, several research trees per faction and hours of gameplay just there alone. You can chose to conquer your system with diplomacy as you explore and develop your planets or simply wage war on everyone, choice is yours. The gameplay is quite slow but can be adjusted in realtime.\n\nSome of the achievements are time consuming but keep some replayability in the game, the online multiplayer requires an Ironclad Online account but you can organsie a match in the chat room and the players there will usually stick throughout the whole session. There are ~400 active players at any given time.\n\nSome drawbacks are the games engine, it isn't optimised well for modern hardware so no matter what you're playing on, if you're waging war in a system with 100+ planets, after some time the game will beging to stutter - if you have low / modest hardware you will see this much sooner. It doesn't have an overall negative impact on the game but should be taken into account. Personally, I wouldn't let it spoil the overall experience that is Sins, this is a game that holds hours of play and while it looks very complicated the tutorials will hold your hand through the basics and from there the game takes no time to get involved with.\n\nA secondary gripe is the lack of a single player story, the intro video looks like it is geared for one but it is not present in this game. I'd still recommend it any day.","January 4, 2014","true","65.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Wonderful graphics and charm, intense battles, sketchy relations, and all around stressful empire building will await you. This game is not a walk in the park, it's more of a 12 mile race to the finish. Except throw in brutal fighting.\n\nFleet makeup and upkeep can make or break you when it comes to defending and expanding your empire. There are many ship types, and a general understanding of each will certainly help.\n\nCreating and maintaning relations is nessecary for anything close to survival, and failing to do some can result in horrible repricutions ranging from pirate raids to general raiding from other players or AI.\n\nManaging your economy, as in any rts, is something that should be learned and practiced from start if you plan to do well. Managing your planets and fleets, and upgrading your tech to assist in that should be seconded only to combating other factions.\n\nSoaSER is a great, if slow, game.

Mara [A]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maraworf/","83 products in account","One of the best RTS 4X strategy games out there.\n\nThis game is about pure survival, you will try to use whatever tool necessary to make sure your empire sees another day.\nIt offers the four mighty Xs, Exploring the darkest corners of the solar systems or entire sectors. Expanding your empire by colonizing all kinds of different planets, asteroids and stations. Gathering basic resources which you need for your empire's growth and most importantly eliminating rival opponents in both single or multiplayer matches.\n\nOne of the greatest features of this game is actually the option to zoom in onto even the smallest objects in the space. Therefore you can enjoy some really beautiful sights of awesome ship and building models and space battles.\nYou can take control over large amount of ships which you can even asign into custom fleets to ease issuing commands.\nThe game's soundtracks are one of the best I've listened to while playing any kind of strategy games, simply marvelous.\n\nBoth single player and multiplayer gameplay is really smooth and solid. All the base game races are surprisingly well balanced. Every race has its pros and cons, but they share a kind of a basic setup from where the different specializations start off. What really surprised me about this game is that you can actually host a multiplayer match on a public IP with an access to your router's port-forwarding rather than crating LAN or Official lobbies.\n\nThere are few things that actually dissapoint me about this game.\nOne of them is the lack of any sort of story based missions or a campaign, which is really a shame, because the littly backstory of this game is really interesting and is surely worth pointing out.\nThe other, but not the last thing is about the not very efficient AI difficulty levels.\nUsing increased income bonuses and faster research as a buff for higher difficulty AI is in my opinion wrong move and it is nearly impossible to defeat highest difficulty AI in a regular match just on your own, without anyone else to balance the enormous pressure on, because the enemy's economy overcomes you in just few minutes into the game.\n\nOther great thing worth pointing out is the support for mods. There are plenty of awesome mods out there, which can really spice up the gameplay of the base game or add an entire new experience with something new, using conversions.\n\nAs of the DLCs, If you find yourself enjoying this game at first, and you kinda get into it I certainly recommend adding both of them into your game as each of them adds some minor things and tweaks that can really improve the overall gameplay experience of every match you play.\n\nI've played this game for more than a thousand hours in total off-steam and I enjoy every battle I manage to win or lose decisively or just by a pure luck. SoaSER is love, SoaSER is life.\n\nWithout anything more to say, I would rate this game by 9/10 for how awesome it is.","March 4, 2015","true","122.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is highly addictive and takes a lot of time to get into the swing of things but you won't notice, you will be too busy exploring Feros, while defending Gateway and sending an envoy to Lexmada at the same time! The game plays much like a space orientated RTS with a top-down camera as default, you can change the visuals in a fullly flexible camera and the zoom can be looking at a shole solar system or a single planet.\n\nThe game itself features 3x factions, split into 2x subfactions each. There are a variety of ships & buildings available, several research trees per faction and hours of gameplay just there alone. You can chose to conquer your system with diplomacy as you explore and develop your planets or simply wage war on everyone, choice is yours. The gameplay is quite slow but can be adjusted in realtime.\n\nSome of the achievements are time consuming but keep some replayability in the game, the online multiplayer requires an Ironclad Online account but you can organsie a match in the chat room and the players there will usually stick throughout the whole session. There are ~400 active players at any given time.\n\nSome drawbacks are the games engine, it isn't optimised well for modern hardware so no matter what you're playing on, if you're waging war in a system with 100+ planets, after some time the game will beging to stutter - if you have low / modest hardware you will see this much sooner. It doesn't have an overall negative impact on the game but should be taken into account. Personally, I wouldn't let it spoil the overall experience that is Sins, this is a game that holds hours of play and while it looks very complicated the tutorials will hold your hand through the basics and from there the game takes no time to get involved with.\n\nA secondary gripe is the lack of a single player story, the intro video looks like it is geared for one but it is not present in this game. I'd still recommend it any day.","January 4, 2014","true","65.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Matches can concievably be played over the course of a few days, with fleets of apocalyptic proportions being the end result, blasting eachother into oblivion. Battles start small and get very, very big in scale as they go on, and the game even has a sweet cinemetic option that makes it easier to watch the space combat. Just don't do that in a serious fight or you'll find your ships exploding without you around to control them.\n\nThe factions are slightly reminiscant of Starcraft's, with the defensive humans, offensive genetics-minded evil aliens and fanatical religious psychics. Space battles are fun but the game truly becomes great when you get diplomacy involved and start paying serious attention to economics, the game gives you alot of time to think and it's at it's most fun when that time is spent controlling as many of the intricate pieces in the game as possible.\n\nDefinitely worth everything, highly reccomended to anyone who likes to take things slow and play mastermind.","January 28, 2015","true","229.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/courier_ttf/recommended/204880/","courier_ttf","Filthy Hanzo Spammer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/courier_ttf/","73 products in account","This game is an RTS - 4X hybrid (which focuses a lot more onthe RTS aspect), featuring three different races with two factions each (Rebels and Loyalists). Each faction is a bit different from the other, while they share base similarities.\nThis last expansion, which is now also standalone, has all the features (and more) than the previous ones had: Diplomacy and Entrenchment.\nI do quite like it, I've spent many hours on it and I do suggest you buy it if you like RTS games that are set in space. It's pretty unique on itself because of the rather uncommon lore the game has; there's no story nor any form of campaign, you are given the races and a bunch of maps (quite big bunch in fact) and you just play. I hope that the backstories of each race are expanded upon with any further release/DLC and I hope that some day we see official campaigns, meanwhile we still have the map creator tools.\n\nIt also is mod compatible, even online.\nHas pretty grafix and doesn't play too bad, although the framerate will progressively decrease on big maps with lots of AI players and units (sometimes to the point of having a 20fps slideshow, but the slideshow is still pretty!)\nNew units and all that yadda.\n\nOverall 8.7/10 Would recommend again.","February 12, 2013","true","62.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Thus, it was to my pleasure to find that the gameplay of this game took me completely by surprise. When I purchased this game (due to a passing recommendation by a friend) I was expecting a mediocre 'annihilate-and-win' type of strategy game. What I found instead was a game that truly catered for just about any type of strategy player. One can win via a multiple of ways spanning from cultural domination to research to the common exterminate victory to name just a few. The cultural element of the game was a particularly impressive feature. As a strategist who prefers to punch my enemies into submission, I realized that the threat posed by a culturally superior race only too late in my first few games, where I believed I was winning the game through annihilation. Hence, unlike most strategy games, those who prefer to fortify and dig into their defences can technically still win the game without firing a single shot into the enemy ranks.\n\nThe resource accumilation and the ship upkeep features tends to keep most players in check, ensuring that no particular player can expand so quickly that he should overwhelm a coalition of players teaming up against him. This is a neat feature, as it forces players to think cunningly, lest too many of his enemies turn against him united in hate or paranoia.\n\nAmongst other notable features, I also found the time taken to travel between planets to be a key feature of this game. I had not originally known that travelling between say... 4 planets would take a decent amount of time. This means by the time my main fleet arrives to defend a planet under siege, it has probably already been raised to the ground. Hence, players are forced to pre-empt incoming attacks or opt to divide and conquer.\n\nThe multiplayer experience is quite enjoyable as this game seems to have a relatively small but extremely friendly following. I was pleasantly surprised to find there are plenty of new players to the multiplayer experience as well as veterans who can teach a newcomer a thing or two.\n\nOverall, Sins of a Solar Empire ranks very, very highly amongst my favourite strategy games. While the visuals of the game is not entirely awe-inspiring, it is very obvious the developers paid a significant portion of their time working on the mechanics of the game. I am happy to say that personally for me, their hard work has paid off and left a very satisfied player in their wake.\n\nOverall Score: 9/10 - Extremely satisfying to play, would highly recommend.","January 26, 2014","true","130.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well perhaps I should tell you why I have been playing this game so much. Sins of The Solar Empire Rebellion base game is fun. Many of the larger games will take you 4-6 hours to complete and will challenge you till the ending hour.  The battles are fun to watch, research trees are well thought out, and itâs a fun real time strategy game.  The base game isnât the only part of the game, there is a good size modding community for this game and I have spent playing 80+ hours on that! Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, and Star Gate are some of the mods that have been (or being) made for this game! Downloading and installing the mods are fairly easy and there are videos on YouTube which will help you out. This game is one of the best space strategy games and modded games I have ever played and on summer sale or fall sale it will go 50% to 75% off.  If you like modding, buy this game now and you will spend 100+ hours like me. If you donât want to mod and just play the base game it is a very fun game and you will gets your moneyâs worth Iâm sure. This game will also run on almost any machine due to itâs age but mods will take more power to run then the base game.","September 18, 2015","true","210.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Games can take 2-8 hours depending on settings. If you are on a very big map with multiple players or AI then games can even take 20+ hours to finish. PvP multiplayer games however can be as short as 20 minutes or as long as 6 hours. AI games typically take longer to complete depending on your play style\n\nThe AI comes in several difficulties. The higher difficulties give a great challenge that no other RTS AI I have played can match.\n\nThe game comes with a map builder so you can make any type and size map that you want to suit your needs\n\n8/10 Highly recommend! Great AI, great gameplay, great balance, amazing graphics, and challenging multiplayer.

Extremely high replay value.\n\nBack in the day, I played a game called Pax Imperia and its sequel Eminent Domain. In many ways, Sins of a Solar Empire looks, feels, and plays like the successor to these games.\n______________________________________\n\nPros:\nâ¢ Tutorials are fairly short and adequately teach gameplay.\nâ¢ Many AI difficulty settings means the game will continue to be challenging for experienced players.\nâ¢ Autosave feature is unobtrusive. Autosave feature keeps a full-game history, allowing you to go back to any point.\nâ¢ 6 different victory types which can selectively be turned off/on.\nâ¢ Good soundtrack. Almost all voiceovers are well done.\nâ¢ Very large selection of pre-made maps, can randomly generate maps of any size, and comes with a map designer.\nâ¢ Each race features a completely unique tech tree and set of units. Large selection of unit types each with their own skills.\nâ¢ Diplomacy system is understandable and works well.\nâ¢ With the amount of customization present, it's likely the next release in this series will be out long before you are bored with this game.\nâ¢ Map navigation is easy and intuitive.\n______________________________________\n\nCons:\nâ¢ While the background universe Ironclad Games has developed is cool, there is no "story mode."\nâ¢ No customization of races or factions (one of my favorite features from Eminent Domain).\nâ¢ One voiceover is not very good and it annoys me every time I hear it.\nâ¢ Tech trees can be slightly overwhelming on the first couple games.\nâ¢ I wish it had more cosmetic options (such as changable ship skins, more portraits, etc).\nâ¢ Hotkeys are difficult to learn.\n______________________________________\n\nOther Comments:\nâ¢ DRM is nothing to worry about, just a 30-second product registration.\nâ¢ Seriously, play the tutorials. You don't get to complain about a game's learning curve if you didn't bother to read the instructions.","September 29, 2014","true","22.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although initially the game might have a steep learning curve once learned it gives great pleasure and infinite hours of fun.\n\nPros\n+ Impressive graphics for a real time strategy game\n+ Three different races with different playstyles\n+ Hours of sandbox campaign fun (against AI or other players online)\n+ Tech research tree different for each faction\n+ Spectacular space battles\n+ Great music\n\nCons\n- Lack of campaign mode (your campaign is what you do in sandbox mode so you need some immagination)\n- More in depth planetary administration would be nice\n- Lack of an in depth lore for the game\n\nOverall for me is a solid 8/10. This game really need just more features and variety to shine. DLCs help in this regard however more are needed. A campaign is a must here.\nIn conclusion should you buy this game? Yes if you like real time strategy set in space and have one or two good friends to play the game with. You won't be disappointed. Buy it with all the DLCs though to have a complete experience.","June 25, 2014","true","15.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each faction is a bit different from the other, while they share base similarities.\nThis last expansion, which is now also standalone, has all the features (and more) than the previous ones had: Diplomacy and Entrenchment.\nI do quite like it, I've spent many hours on it and I do suggest you buy it if you like RTS games that are set in space. It's pretty unique on itself because of the rather uncommon lore the game has; there's no story nor any form of campaign, you are given the races and a bunch of maps (quite big bunch in fact) and you just play. I hope that the backstories of each race are expanded upon with any further release/DLC and I hope that some day we see official campaigns, meanwhile we still have the map creator tools.\n\nIt also is mod compatible, even online.\nHas pretty grafix and doesn't play too bad, although the framerate will progressively decrease on big maps with lots of AI players and units (sometimes to the point of having a 20fps slideshow, but the slideshow is still pretty!)\nNew units and all that yadda.\n\nOverall 8.7/10 Would recommend again.","February 12, 2013","true","62.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So it gets repetitive after a while, but the idea of getting out there and exploring a new galaxy brings you back after a break. I really wish Stardock had taken the time to make a single-player campaign. They did it for GalCiv, why not for this?\n\nPros:\n- The creation of the Mega Cruisers is nice\n- The factions create more Mega Cruisers\n\nCons:\n- Still no campaign\n- The factions really do nothing besides create more Mega Cruisers","May 24, 2015","true","23.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ok Fine\n\nSins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is a unique space RTS games that centers around moving from planet to planet conquering and establishing your empire. The closest thing you can compare this game to is like playing CiV 5 in space, but its in real time.\n\nOther than the homeworld franchise and a little nastalgic empire at war, this is one of the only space RTS games in existence that not only does not suck more than a tai hooker, but it actually pretty well done. Featuring massive and i mean massive battles between fleets of ships by the end game your ships will probably ram into eachother from a siezure because of all the laser beams flying everywhere.\n\nAs previously stated you start on 1 planet that revolves around 1 star, you then migrate to neighboring planets exterminating anything you come across around the planet, then you invade and conquer the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of it like a space age christopher columbus. Maps however can be extremely large, featuring multiple stars, each with their own set of planets revolving around them to conquer and add to the might of your empire.\n\nOh did i mention when you attack a planet already controlled by another main faction of the game you literally nuke it from orbit (because its the only way to be sure) until everyone dies and you can recolonize it, if that isnt enough for you then i dont know what is.\n\nThe reason i also say this game is a real time space version of civ 5 is because the game moves at a slow enough pace that you are playing an RTS, but at the same time you can manage your empire and economy etc with ease. The game also has one of the most well done camera systems ive seen in an RTS game, allowing you can look and go anywhere despite the map being gigantic, all with the simplicity of a scroll wheel.\n\nBut seriously, one of the best space rts games in existence, So if you are into either i would absolutely recommend buying it. Ever since i bought the original game its given me YEARS of entertainment.","January 3","true","42.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Games can take 2-8 hours depending on settings. If you are on a very big map with multiple players or AI then games can even take 20+ hours to finish. PvP multiplayer games however can be as short as 20 minutes or as long as 6 hours. AI games typically take longer to complete depending on your play style\n\nThe AI comes in several difficulties. The higher difficulties give a great challenge that no other RTS AI I have played can match.\n\nThe game comes with a map builder so you can make any type and size map that you want to suit your needs\n\n8/10 Highly recommend! Great AI, great gameplay, great balance, amazing graphics, and challenging multiplayer. For new players It may take a while to learn the controls and what everything does; the tutorials aren't as detailed as they could be so this knocks my score down a notch","July 30, 2014","true","281.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The modding community has crafted multiple mods for it, each allowing for additional hours of gameplay and fun with friends should you know others who enjoy this game as well. The only downside is the lack of a proper campaign but that seems to be the case now adays with most games sadly but that can be overlooked with the right friends playing with you.

This was one of the earliest games I played (probably second actually) and I had the game of the year edition on disk (so don't let the time counter fool you, I've actually spent a lot more time on sins outside of steam).\n\nHonestly from a space RTS I really couldn't ask for much more. It's a slightly old game so the graphics aren't "next gen" however the interface is very convenient and allows for quick switching between zoomed out tactical views to help manage your fleet battles, and a more up close cinematic view to really engage the player into what's going on. The civilization management aspect is also very indepth and has many different factors which need to be accounted for when making certain decisions. Coupling that with a very indepth research tree (many aspects of which are race specific) and the other deep differences in the entire play style of the three races, there's a lot of varience for enjoyable replayability.\n\nHonestly thought... I'd say the best part is just the scale the battles can get too, and mine haven't even been that grand compared to other's I've seen. It's quite enjoyable to watch a fleet of 100 frigates, and 50 or so cruisers charge into a pirate base, only for their pirate adversaries to just be engulphed and devoured in your swarms of hundreds of fighters and bombers at the ready.\n\nAlso... the main difference the rebellion version has over the rest is that it adds two subfactions to eatch race, loyalists and rebels, and each of these subfactions has their own individual titan, which is just awesome. The titans add a new aspect to the combat as they can be the definite deciding factor in many of your future battles, and when you watch one plow through the enemy frigates like a steam roller... well let's just say it's satisfying.\n\nSo honestly all in all I think it's worth it and you can get a lot of hours out of it. Of course it's still smart to wait for sales, so if it's on sale for cheap I'd say snatch it up. However that's just me and my experiences, I hope this helped, bye!","June 20, 2014","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The battles can really be spectacular.\n\nSure there are plenty of options for diplomacy and espionage, etc, but lets face it, we really only need massive ships pummelling the crap out of each other.

Now this game is not too difficult to get into and with a simple guide getting to know the races, buildings, and ships won't take too long.  Where this game really shines though is how experienced you can get at managing your fleet, attacking other players, and if you want to know how in depth this game is look up the damage tables for all the ships.  While this game came out in 2012 it still is a great space RTS in a current game market that doesn't release many RTS games anymore, so if you like a simple but very detailed space RTS this is a great choice.","February 21","true","150.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The pictures above show what actual gameplay looks like for the most part, and I found myself ooing and ahhing quite often.\n+ 3 entire races to choose from, each fundamentally different. Each empire is easy to pick up once you get the hang of the game, but you'll find you prefer one race over the others, depending on your playstyle. In addition, you can pick between "Rebel" and "Loyalist" classes in each race, which have their own perks as well!\n+ There are many ways to win the game. Choose to conquer your enemies by destroying and taking over their planets, research technology, form peace treaties, etc...\n+ Diplomacy is a fun aspect of the game, and can be quite challenging to manage at times.\n+ Once you get the hang of the game, it's very fun and engaging.\n+ You get to build MASSIVE fleets and manage planets at a universal level. It's freakin' awesome.\n+ You can create and customize your own universe to play on! It's a lot of fun to make your own maps and see how well you do on them. Most of the time you'll play on fair, randomized maps.\n+ The game has a speed-up function for offline play (up to 8x speed) so you can shorten a 20 hour experience vs 8 tough AI to maybe 5 (just an example).\n\n- If you don't have a powerful computer, you may not be able to experience the game to its fullest when manning a massive fleet.\n- Pretty steep learning curve; you really want to play the tutorials so you have a remote clue as to what to do.\n- All undiscovered planets have neutral units that try to kill you so it's tough to colonize. You get used to it.\n- Matches can be really, really long. Also, units take a long time to travel. It's as "realistic" as space games can get, however.\n\nThe "Gray Area":\n\nThis may be different preference for some people, but some matches can potentially last for hours on end. Computer matches can be paused and saved, but human vs. human really can't be. Playing vs AI is still very engaging, and with the many levels of difficulty, you won't be missing out much if you choose not to play vs human players. Either way, it's a satisfying game for the casual weekend gamer all the way to the basement dweller.\n\nAlso, pirates. Pirates can be a b*tch. You can pay them to attack other empires, but you are also at risk of being out-bidden and being attacked as well. They add a really cool element to the game, and you have the option to turn them off. I personally turned them off until I learned the game well, then turned them back on for the fun of it.\n\nFinal Thoughts/Review:\n\nWhen I first bought the game, I really wasn't sure what I was getting myself into; the pictures on the store page are a very simplified and zoomed in view of the game. In actuality, you are looking at a planet-by-planet point of view 90% of the time. The user interface isn't shown in the pictures, and when the game first starts, you are pretty much thrown into the game without much mercy. Once you play through all the tutorials and get beaten around by an easy AI the first time, you start to pick up the tricks of the game. Then you develop strategies. Then you start winning. Then it gets really fun. Then you starting adding more players. Then you increase the difficulty. Then you do it again.\n\nWith randomized universes, huge options between each type of empire/victory method, scope of the game, level of challenge, I can't say bad things about this game. Once you invest a bit of time, Sins of a Solar Empire is worth every penny you spend on it.\n\n9.5/10. The only reason I don't rate higher is because I don't have time to play it all the time.\n*re-rated higher after some consideration.","June 20, 2014","true","28.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It does take some getting used to at first, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes very addicting.\nGraphics and gameplay greatly balanced. No extra effects that do not add to the gameplay. If you have a beefy rig, or a standard laptop, the settings are highly configurable to suite your needs. You can zoom right in and see your ships shoot lasers and rockets at the enemy, watch your fleet jump into an intense 3D fire-fight, and zoom in on a building that you just destroyed to watch it explode.\nYou will always be researching armor, weapon, mining, colonization, and diplomatic sciences to improve your empire. Build a variety of ships, defensive structures, and planetary upgrades to improve you empire's spread rate and combat effectiveness.\nOverall I would rate this game 9/10. Love the game, but matches can take hours, and not everyone has that time. But what do you expect?

Sins of a Solar Empire is one of those games balanced in such a way that there's no clear balance. That doesn't mean it's bad, it just means that each race (the Vasari, the TEC, and the Advent) have different playing styles.\n\nIn contrast to games such as StarCraft, where everone knows the three races have their own triangle of defeat (Zerg beats Protoss, Protoss beats Terran, and Terran beats Zerg), Sins of a Solar Empire is all about your strategy. Will you expand your space outwards, take planets and conquer the enemy, or will you lie in wait until the time is right?\n\nThe scale of the game is truely marvelous, but often goes overlooked. The zoom function is really helpful, as it shows that even the tiniest of battles are absurdly dramatic: If you're zoomed out enough, you see two little ship icons, and perhaps some fire in between them, Zoom in more and you see stunning 3D models, complete with thrusters, blinking lights, etc, and you can see exactly what they're firing. Zoom in until one fills your screen and suddenly you notice that it's on fire, sparks are flying, and the enemy's fire is devastating the hull with massive explosions.\n\nIf you love strategy games, space games, or just want to watch ships burn, you'll probably like this game.\n\n","September 6, 2014","true","218.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Comparing Sins:Entrenchment to this game, not much changes. Yes, there are "more" factions, yes there are titans. But, thats about it. The mechanics don't change, and the gameplay is about the same. The only thing worth mentioning is that if you play multiplayer, you will most certainly not be allowed to build corvettes in game. This is a result of corvette rushing happening, and the overall cost effectiveness greatly outweighing any other ship.\nHowever, that being said, I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing love this game. If you decide to get it, I would reccomend the purchase of the expansions packs. They add quite a bit more depth to the game and make it an overall better experience. This game has everything from a working "stock market" to galaxy vs galaxy space combat. If you are interested in the RTS genre of games, this is a game for you. While there is a 4X aspect of the game, it is not worth mentioning. Given the only such element of the 4X genre implemented is tech research, which is almost standard in newer RTS games. This game allows you to govern a race of your choosing, then choose a sub faction within that race and start the game. Your goal can be either conquest, diplomacy, economy, research, or even exploration. With a variety of win options and a very in depth diplomatic system, this game has it all. It is very hard to play this game and not enjoy some part of it. Despite it's almost civilization esque times for games, Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion will go down as the greatest space RTS ever created, and my personal favorite.","December 25, 2013","true","203.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Do be warned that the pacing is quite slow (though there are plenty of options, both during the game and in the set-up, to circumvent that) and multiplayer isn't exactly a crowning feature. The touted 4X elements are certainly more present here than they were in the vanilla game, but you'll need the moderately priced DLC to really achieve the advertised combination. Alternatively, you can use mods, which are fairly easy to install.\n\nAlso, there is no campaign, and there likely won't be one. The backstory, while interesting, is all you get. So, you'd better enjoy skirmish mode.\n\nFor those of you who owned the vanilla game (and only vanilla) this is a significant improvement, as it comes bundled with the two other expansions, Entrenchment and Diplomacy. If you owned the Trilogy edition...not so much. The core Rebellion content mainly focuses on faction diversification. There are now six total factions, consisting of two sects of each of the three vanilla factions. They play very differently, especially in the late game when their tech trees begin to diverge. The TEC Loyalists, for example, are centered around an impenetrable defense and long-range bombardment, whereas the Vasari Loyalists become extremely devoted to mobility and attritive tactics (as in, they operate without terrestrial holdings and can cannibalize conquered worlds). New means of attaining victory have been added, from Diplomatic to KotH and more. The graphics are enhanced, and two new ship classes (super-massive, incredibly powerful Titans and "just-barely-larger-than-a-squadron-unit, Titan-slaying Corvettes) are included as well.\n\nBut, I'm really starting to ramble and repeat the description, so, yeah, consider purchasing this game if you're a fan of the 4X genre. The scale is literally massive (hundreds of planets, several star systems) and the lasers are pretty.","December 3, 2013","true","52.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/violenceworks/recommended/204880/","violenceworks","Violenceworks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/violenceworks/","537 products in account","This game has been adding new game objectives, research, ships, orbital structures and planet types for a number of years now and it has turned it into a really great game. Each of the races and now factions within the races (Loyalist/Rebellion) offer higher defensive, offensive, economic or boosts to your culture (culture will overthrow enemy planets non violently) which gives a varying amount of replayability and playstyles. The learning curve for playing this game is low to mid, it doesn't take long to learn how to play.\n\nIn this game you'll be able to build up a massive fleet armada or split your fleet in two or three and raid the enemy's core planets after destroying their fleet. You'll be able to build starbases that can halt the advance of armadas until they are dealt with that also protect your trade empire from pirate raiders, jumping away from a starbase before it is destroyed seriously damages ships automatically.\n\nThis recent expansion breaks each of the three races into a loyalist and rebel faction. Each group has unique researchable abilities that offer different playstyles (defensive, offensive, culture) and each loyalist and rebel race receives a different Titan ship, a juggernaught of a ship that is 10 times larger than any capitol ship. These Titans can easily throw a pitched battle by special abilities that will either do area effect or very high single target damage, while others are disablement oriented, reducing the damage your fleet takes and reducing the firing rate of the enemy.\n\nGeneral overview of races:\n\nTEC (Trade Emergency Coalition) - An economic powerhouse compared to the other races with quicker access to trade ports and higher research done that gives you extra credits anytime another faction buys something. The ships they field are considerably weaker though at end game research, as they have less fleet support abilities unless you have they loyalist capitol ship in the fleet to help reduce incoming damage. Their ships have high armor and their ultimate weapon is the Novalith Cannon, a weapon that sits in a planet's gravity well and regularly fires shots at enemy planets destroying all life on them and making them temporarily uncolonizable.\n\nAdvent - This race, in my opinion, fields the best armadas in the game. Their capitol ships and cruisers offer a lot of support abilities to spread damage to each ship, redirect damage from their own ships back to the enemy, area effect shield recharge all the while fielding a massive amount of fighters and bombers making the need for direct engagement with an enemy fleet purely optional. The flip side to this is they have a really weak economy and the worst ultimate weapon compared to the TEC or Vasari. Their ships have very high shields and their ultimate weapon shoots at enemy planets your planet's culture which is easily countered.\n\nVasari - A brutal alien race that terrorizes the galaxy thru subjegating and enslaving other races. They get a later start with building up their economy but their economy is pretty great at end game. Their units have a variety of disablement oriented abilities and a area effect hull repair and they tend to have higher hull values than the other races. Further research into missile technology allows you to bypass shields making them excellent against advent in a stand up fight. Their ultimate weapon is the Kostura cannon that will shoot at enemy planets damaging and disabling enemy structures in that planet's gravity well. If an enemy fleet is there, the fleet will be temporarily disabled and be unable to move or attack making it an invaluable tool to use while attacking with your fleet.\n\nIf you are a RTS fan or just enjoy viewing space warfare, I'd definetely recommend this game.","January 30, 2014","true","505.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game is probably the best Space based game I've ever played.\n\nSin's of a Solar Empire started off as a revolutionary Space combat system, with hundreds of planets, dozens of ships and unlimited possibilities.\n\nRebellion is the next step, and Stardock did not dissapoint me at all. This game is as close to perfection as you can get. Amazing graphics, gripping storyline, and explosive combat. In this game, you take command of one of six Factions, and command an entire empire throughout war and peace. You can choose from one of six factions, of three Races.\n\n\nThe Trader Emergency Coalition is the human empire. They were formed after an alien assault, and have been fighting a losing battle ever since. The Loyalists want to find a diplomatic way to end the war, preferably saving as many lives as possible along the way. The Rebels on the other hand, are only interested in Human domination, and will do anything to destroy the enemies of humanity.\n\nThe Advent are a long lost sect of Humanity. They strive to seek peace and enlightenment, and the only way they see they can succeed is by either indoctrinating everyone else, or destroying those who appose the Unity. The loyalists are trying to remain peacefull, spreading their religion as far as they can, taking over worlds through persuasion, and not violence. The Rebels are violently assaulting other worlds, using massive weapons of mass destruction and mind control to overthrow planetary governments.\n\nThe Vasari are an ancient race, born in the beginnings of the galaxy. They are all that remain of a galaxy spanning empire, and are fleeing from a dangerous species, known only as the unknown. They are incredibly powerful, and will do anything they can to keep their species alive, through intimidation, or slavery. Loyalists of the Vasari commune want to enslave or destroy the other races they have encountered, while the Rebels want to work together to survive, and the gods know that to survive something that can destroy an entire empire, who knows what will have to be done.....\n\n\n20/20 Score\n\n10/10 for Graphics and Visuals\n10/10 for Storyline and Gameplay\n\n","May 18, 2014","true","208.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

Iâve seen battles with hundreds of ship engaging each other as more reinforcements filter in from distant star systems. Even friendly comp stomp games can last for hours as your forces slowly conquer the cosmos. Whether this is epic or tedious is a matter of taste, but I fall into the epic camp.\n\nSins plays a little like a 4X game. Youâll explore the universe, colonize and develop planets, research all manner of military and civilian technologies, meet other peoples, and kill them.  Throughout youâll be struggling with issues like whether asteroid colony Y would benefit more from a refinery, trade port, or capital ship factory. You are Space Stalin, staying up late in your space Kremlin while devising plans to ensure your people are mining enough crystals to build the ships youâve just researched. This isnât a game where youâll dance a little hero unit around the map. Yes, you can do a little micromanagement. However, youâve got a lot on your plate already. Itâs best to just let the Battleship Captain decide when he wants to fire his special Gauss Rail Gun.\n\nIf you want to play an RTS during a lunch break then this is definitely not for you. Itâs possible that you could order units to help save an allyâs distant home world, step away from the computer, go out and grab some lunch, eat said lunch, and return before the battle finished. That kind of scale and speed will be a turn off for many people. However, I highly recommend Sins of a Solar Empire Rebellion to patient people with an inner Ming the Merciless.\n","November 27, 2014","true","20.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The battles could reach epic sizes (on large galaxies) where hundrets of  ships fight for one planet.\n\nTitans and Corvettes, which was both introduced with Rebellion, changed the way to play extremly if you compare it with the predecessor.\n\nAll three main factions plays different and focus on other ways to overcome there enemies. The grafic is absolutly impressive for a 4x game. Music and Sound are also up to date and give you the right "space feeling" while playing. The AI is a very hard opponent in higher difficulties, so the game keeps challenging.\n\nThe Multiplayer is active and you can always find someone to play against the AI or each other.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deadpool128/recommended/204880/","Deadpool128","Deadpool","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deadpool128/","54 products in account","Hey all, Deadpool here with a review. Now that the obvious is out of the way, let's get to it shall we? Here be the review for Sins of a Solar Empire; Rebellion, a 4X RTS game set in space. Oooooooooo.\n\nPlot\nThere isn't one. At least not that I can infer. I think. Let me start from the beginning. Rebellion is the first Sins game I have played. As with sequels, you'd usually get a recap, yes? Crysis 3 has a rather long one, the Assassin's Creed games(save for the first) have recaps, and the list goes on. Sins of a Solar Empire; Rebellion does not have one. So me being new to the series, I have absolutely no clue what is going on. The intro video, while stunning and well done, offered little to no info. All I know(and still know because I am too lazy to Google) is that there are humans, some very spiritual alien peeps, and some nano-tech alien things that are running from something. Each race has been split into Loyalists and Rebels. So you have, vaguely, six to choose from.\n\nThe Good Stuff\nThe game is pretty well balanced. The developers seem to have a keen eye for balance between the various ship classes and races that produce the ships. I tried spamming with smaller frigates, but was easily defeated. A balanced fleet is a good one, and the Devs seem to have hit the nail on the head when it came to making sure of it. The Same can be said for the balance between the factions themselves.\n\nGraphics. Wow. The explosions seem legit, and make the camera shake if you zoom in. Which, I love. The level of detail in the game is astounding. Then again, it being a space based game, you'd really hope so. Truly well thought out and beautiful artwork. Same can be said for the sound. Very, very well done and aesthetically pleasing.\n\nComplex, but simple. It is complex enough to thoroughly enjoy and really make you think about your next move, yet simple enough to where there is a minimal learning curve; especially for someone like me who has never played a Sins game before. Little to no micromanaging of your planets and/or colonies, which allows you to truly focus on your fleet, defense, economy, and of course diplomacy.\n\nNow, for diplomacy. The devs offered up something I haven't seen in diplomacy before I played this game. It is complex with your actions affecting not only the intended faction, but rippling through to the other factions in the game. And likewise with their actions. Not only that, but to create alliances and forge pacts, not only do they have to like you, but your people have to like them. I, for one, absolutely love this. It prevents you from going all out and forging alliances just to win an allied victory and truly brings into perspective just how closely and how far the devs went to instill a balance into the game.\n\nVoice acting. It is phenomenal. 'Nuff said. Some of the best I have seen. Or heard, rather.\n\nDiversity. The diversity between the three races, and even their Loyalist and Rebel sub-factions, is outstanding. The research options differ greatly between the three races. The technologies are different, the voices are different, everything is different! Mostly. Each time you play as a different race, it feels and plays completely different from the last.\n\n\nThe Bad Stuff\nCampaign. There isn't one. The only mode, aside from multiplayer online, is relative to skirmish mode on Command and Conquer games. That's it. No campaign to play through, nothing. Nothing but a repetitive procession of skirmish after skirmish. Set up, conquer, win. Set up, conquer, win. As amazing as the game looks, it gets old. Unless you're like me and use Galaxy Forge(Comes with the game, program you can use to create your own maps) to play very sadistic games with the AI.\n\nSpeaking of AI, it is very finicky. If you have great defenses, they don't attack. Even when you set them on the hardest difficulty, they wont attack. The only good thing about the AI is the diplomacy, and watching them fight between themselves. I once sat for two hours watching five AI's battle it out over 2 different star systems. There was a tug of war, take and lose. The AI's fight each other real well, but if you're too powerful they leave you alone like you have the plague. If you maintain a decent level of awesomeness, they will attack you. They will take what you have and own you. So it is somewhat of a balancing act. Depends on how you want to play it.\n\nMicro Management. I put this in the Bad Stuff section as well because if you're like me and love micro managing, then this game will disappoint. Yeah sure you build things in orbit to advance your culture and spread it, but so what? I want to be able to see who the leaders are, select the political whatevermajiggs, change the funding from research to defense if I wanted, and truly see what my people(ingame people, you know, in my empire) are made of. But no. You get a planet, some aircraft whizzing around it, and city lights if you're on the nighttime side of it. That's it. To me, once you learn the game and how to play it, there is sooooo much room for micromanagement. But, I can see why the Devs didn't do it. It is an RTS game, and sometimes not enough time for micromanagement.\n\n\nConclusion\nNow that I touched on just a few of the high and low points of the game, here is my condensed review of my review of the game. To be frank, the game is amazing. Excellent mechanics, balance, diplomacy, voice acting, visuals, diversity, and a true pleasure to play. Tutorials are available if you have questions, but in the end you will still be discovering little things here and there that you can do months after the fact. Lack of a campaign makes the endless C&C and Starcraft-like map skirmishes repetitive and give it a lack of long-term playability(Invented that word just for this review). In this game, I feel, the Pros outweigh the Cons and thus I give it a 7 out of 10.","April 9, 2014","true","51.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

This game is as close to perfection as you can get. Amazing graphics, gripping storyline, and explosive combat. In this game, you take command of one of six Factions, and command an entire empire throughout war and peace. You can choose from one of six factions, of three Races.\n\n\nThe Trader Emergency Coalition is the human empire. They were formed after an alien assault, and have been fighting a losing battle ever since. The Loyalists want to find a diplomatic way to end the war, preferably saving as many lives as possible along the way. The Rebels on the other hand, are only interested in Human domination, and will do anything to destroy the enemies of humanity.\n\nThe Advent are a long lost sect of Humanity. They strive to seek peace and enlightenment, and the only way they see they can succeed is by either indoctrinating everyone else, or destroying those who appose the Unity. The loyalists are trying to remain peacefull, spreading their religion as far as they can, taking over worlds through persuasion, and not violence. The Rebels are violently assaulting other worlds, using massive weapons of mass destruction and mind control to overthrow planetary governments.\n\nThe Vasari are an ancient race, born in the beginnings of the galaxy. They are all that remain of a galaxy spanning empire, and are fleeing from a dangerous species, known only as the unknown. They are incredibly powerful, and will do anything they can to keep their species alive, through intimidation, or slavery. Loyalists of the Vasari commune want to enslave or destroy the other races they have encountered, while the Rebels want to work together to survive, and the gods know that to survive something that can destroy an entire empire, who knows what will have to be done.....\n\n\n20/20 Score\n\n10/10 for Graphics and Visuals\n10/10 for Storyline and Gameplay\n\n","May 18, 2014","true","208.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

(not this sale,but the last one.) He sees it and thinks it's amazing, I tell him that it is. He gets the game and we immediately begin playing. After about 5 hours of teaching him how to play, he gets tired and leaves.\n\nNow a little bit ago I say we should play again, he is hesitant, but he agrees to anyway. We start up the game and I set everything to faster so he can play a quicker game (faster training, mining, culture.) Everything is going great for the first 10 minutes or so, until we establish first contact.\n\nNow since he is still learning, I have had to teach him up to this point and our technological advancements and colonization have been slow. Not to mention I had to help him learn how to play the Advent as I was playing the TEC. I expected that star to star jumping would be reached within 10 minutes, but they are already here. A couple scouts are not really an issue, so we continue to expand, then my friend is alof a sudden really scared because he had lost one of his colonies. I simply thought he accidentally scuttled it and he was paying attention to his (small) army fighting rebels. It wasnât until the third colony that I went to investigate. There, I found a HUGE war party in his late colonyâs system.\n\nIm freaking out and Telling him to Bring his army back to defend his home world, and that's when I notice that the same this is happening to me. With an army of that size, they must have been expanding into the other galaxies without much trouble, and now we were paying for it.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, and 20 minutes of constantly defending our colonies, I have a great idea. I immediately start rushing siege frigates and my titan (the Ragnarov titan is personally my favorite, which is basically a giant rail gun, with engines and smaller guns all around it) and I tell him to do the same. Confused, he has to listen because he has no other ideas.\n\nMy idea is to win by sneaking 100 siege frigates and a titan into the enemy territory, and take their home planet before they can gets troops back from the front lines (our colonies).

There are literal people who this game is their bread and butter for favorite games and are skilled at it and can bulldoze you and your fleet like a literal bulldozer going over a stick, try AI easy at first then work your way up to about hard then try multiplayer.

(not this sale,but the last one.) He sees it and thinks it's amazing, I tell him that it is. He gets the game and we immediately begin playing. After about 5 hours of teaching him how to play, he gets tired and leaves.\n\nNow a little bit ago I say we should play again, he is hesitant, but he agrees to anyway. We start up the game and I set everything to faster so he can play a quicker game (faster training, mining, culture.) Everything is going great for the first 10 minutes or so, until we establish first contact.\n\nNow since he is still learning, I have had to teach him up to this point and our technological advancements and colonization have been slow. Not to mention I had to help him learn how to play the Advent as I was playing the TEC. I expected that star to star jumping would be reached within 10 minutes, but they are already here. A couple scouts are not really an issue, so we continue to expand, then my friend is alof a sudden really scared because he had lost one of his colonies. I simply thought he accidentally scuttled it and he was paying attention to his (small) army fighting rebels. It wasnât until the third colony that I went to investigate. There, I found a HUGE war party in his late colonyâs system.\n\nIm freaking out and Telling him to Bring his army back to defend his home world, and that's when I notice that the same this is happening to me. With an army of that size, they must have been expanding into the other galaxies without much trouble, and now we were paying for it.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, and 20 minutes of constantly defending our colonies, I have a great idea. I immediately start rushing siege frigates and my titan (the Ragnarov titan is personally my favorite, which is basically a giant rail gun, with engines and smaller guns all around it) and I tell him to do the same. Confused, he has to listen because he has no other ideas.\n\nMy idea is to win by sneaking 100 siege frigates and a titan into the enemy territory, and take their home planet before they can gets troops back from the front lines (our colonies). And very soon, the pan is under way. We have literally every single ship, which added together is only a fraction of our enemies army, and send them on a straight shot for his home world. During this time, he has taken almost all of our colonies(be both have about 2 left) and they donât seem to care that our armies have disappeared.\n\n5 Minutes later, we make the final jump into a heavily fortified system with gauss platforms and mines EVERYWHERE and a fully upgraded starbase.

And honestly it's not coming from nowhere. It is probably one of the best space themed RTS games that you can get currently and the graphics, while a little dated, are still serving their purpose by giving you lots of beamy and exploding goodness when it comes to space battles. What however probably speaks the most for why this game is successfull is it's excellent user interface. All the information you require is easily accessible with the click of a button, if it's not displayed on screen right away. There is no rummaging through submenus and other distracting stuff to find out how many ressources are produced in which colony. The three different factions, which with the addon Rebellion got further split up into Loyalist and Rebel factions also provide many different approaches at how to play the game as each faction has their specialities. Want to have staunch unmoving defenders that will be even harder to remove from a system than cancer? Go with the TEC loyalists. Want a seemingly endless horde of â¥â¥â¥â¥ cheap units to drown your enemies in AND be a pirate on top of that? Go with the TEC rebels, and that are just two sides of one race you can play.\n\nIf you want a space themed RTS with huge space battles, then this is the game to go for.","December 26, 2013","true","91.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I bought a half dozen of similar games from Steam on sale, and while each has their good and bad points, all play basically the same with little variance and limited tactical ability. Get it on sale, not even close to being worth the full price.\n\nGood points. Space battles aren't the quick turn based fights that many such simulators have. The battles in Rebellion actually take a while, you don't need to micromanage them.. just send your ships to enemy area, and your off, they can fight their own fights. Lets you work on your planets, research, etc while your fleet is off doing stuff. Also pirates. Most maps have a pirate homeworld that constantly spawns harder than normal pirate fleets to harass you and the npcs/other players playing the map. Sadly this is easily handled by just giving money in bounty thus letting the pirates attack someone else.\n\nBad points. Game is pretty easy once you figure out a few basic things. Fleet battles will determine map winner, you won't win on diplomacy, or other tactics. Biggest best fleet wins. Pirates are a pain until you quickly figure out how to post bounty switching them to other players.. easy enough. System defenses? kinda useless since fleets can just fly past your defenses unless they are specificially attacking that planet. They can just fly past your fleet until they get to the system they are targetting, so managing your fleet well = win.  Other than that, you simply do what all other space sim type games do. upgrade your planets, do research, build ships to fight other systems. But it isn't super hard, kind of boring after a while once you learn the few basic things to do (expand fast, build up fleet fast, focus more on trade/research than system defenses).\n\nPlus there isn't any campaign. Just pick a map and play. Again, boring after you figure out how easy it is to beat opponents with a big fleet. Of all the space games, i'd say the best thing about this one is the real time fleet fighting, much better system than many of the few turn-based fighting that occurs with other games.","December 3, 2013","true","17.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you liked sins of a solar empire I cannot fathom any reason you wouldn't like rebellion. Havnt played either? Sins is a space based 4x Real Time Strategy game focusing quite largely on fleet composition and production with empire management taking a bit of a back seat. Don't expect civilisation depth but thats not to say its a simple game.\n\nRebellion in my opinion is a good game to go for as a first step into the sins series or for experienced players. The scale of the combat alone can be awesome in the literal sense of the word and the new titan class ships can make for some very interesting boss battle style engagements. The new factions (well, old factions split in to two groups) can really give players a good sense of direction and palystyle which really does run on to the rediculous once you hit the end game research.\n\nThe corvettes while were a nice addition are not overly game changing like much of the other additions much to my own dissapointment and this version still suffers from one drawback it shares with the original trilogy. The combat can look a little stupid at times. While its really cool to see the larger ships turn to fire broadsides at eachother, the smaller ships tend to just sit there like stationary platforms. The smallest ships are a little silly looking as they have a tendancy to literaly fly into their target and fire in a random direction, poorly representing any sense of speed and manuverability or even looking remotely sensible.","December 3, 2013","true","69.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

With the introduction of the colossus class ships, and the split between each of the factions increase the number of playable groups to choose from, each with their own unique characteristics. If you love an RTS that may remind you of Battlestar Galactica, Star Wars, Star Trek, and other well-known science fiction/futuristic storylines with fantastic fleet battles in space while maintaining and expanding a solar empire then this is the game for you!

Everyone loves spaceships! The factions are very asymmetric and they've been distilled further more into two flavors in this latest expandalone.  More leisurely paced than your 5 year younger selves' RTS. A typical game takes 3 hours at the minimum but can easily stretch out to 6 hours or more depending on the map.  They get hella ginormous! Settle in for the long haul and keep on space truckin'. It's kind of a great game. The AI brings the ruck if you ratchet it up.

If you want to pew pew more you can research it in the big guns panel. It takes place in a space with christmas lights in the middle and when you tell your boats to move the paddlers get lazy and it takes a while to get to the fight. The game features yar har fiddle dee dees as well that you can pay with honeycombs to go and be jerks to your enemies while you make more breadboxes and boat ships. The game has 3 different types of man peoples they are all different but kinda the same. Some like the fight, and some like to drink wine, and one does a bit of both. This is a good game to bring to your friends so you can play this for 8 hours instead of cards against humans. In the new expansion pecks there are huge boat ships that don't sink like the titanic, they are really strong and pew pew more than normal boats, each type of peoples get 2 to choose from. If your christmas ordaments get under attack by the boats you can buy these duplo blocks with guns to defense but they can cost you a bit of honeycomb and aren't the best defense against large pewpewmadas. The best way to win is build giant houses in enemy christmas ordament range to mess with them and make them feel like they aren't people before bringing your pewpews to the fight.

There are still elements in the voice acting I can't stand.  For example, the sound of water sucked through a straw doesn't count as good sound effects.  It just sounds dumb.  Also the sound of THE SAME voice actor over and over again for different parts, or some of the ridiculous alien monster sounds.\n\nI hated it so much that I actually wrote a script to copy those sounds out to be replaced by sounds that were neutral.\n\n----- ENOUGH RANTING ALREADY -----\n\nThat said, there is also some good voice acting, like "I hope this isn't another suicide mission!" and when a new colony is founded "A new colony has been founded" and there's some dramatic orchestral music.  "The price on our heads has increased!"  Those I really like, and the more I play the more it grows on me.\n\n\nThe gameplay is simplistic - all the ships do whatever it is they do, and there are minimal choices for changing how they work.  And the capital ships have level caps (maybe that's fixed in some mods).\n\nThere are a number of mods which I still have to try.\n\nWhat I like about this game: it goes pretty fast.  Unlike SotS or Star Ruler or GalCiv - this feels like it plays much faster.  Maybe I'm hallucinating too.  The tech tree is certainly much smaller than those other games - so the whole game feels smaller.\n\nSo for a "quick space game 4x" this is one I find myself going back to.","March 12, 2015","true","27.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The massive space battles between empires is nothing short of spectacular. This game is very easy to learn. The beginning can be really slow, but once you get around 6 planets, you really boost your income, and things start picking up. A downside to this game is you kinda need friends to play with. Battling against AI by yourself kinda gets boring after a little while.

As a longtime Homeworld fan, this game was a lovely jaunt into a lovely mix between Civ 5's grand scale and planning and Homeworld 2's spaceship combat.\n\n\nI flat out adore this game. Its an excellent epic RTS game with a fantastic amount of depth, strategy, and sheer gaw dropping moments geared into it. Small space scouting and colonization leads to small skirmishes, which depending on how you play can lead to dozens of different outcomes - from skirmishes, to cold wars, to flat out epic space fleet battles, to interplanatary bombardments.

While I do really like it, I also started getting annoyed by it very suddenly. If you play against AI, and have multiple AI, they end up ganging up on you, and not fighting eachother. Which may not be a big problem at fist glance, but then the real problem occurs. Super weapons. The AI spams them to no end. And it's incredibly frustrating after a short time. Once the game goes on for a while, you end up bogged down in a boring defend against wave after wave of enemies while rebuilding your rear planets over and over due to super weapon attacks war of attrition. And not one of material/money, but of patience.\n\nI'd love to recomend the game because it is fun, but this fatal flaw for anyone who doesn't want to just rush every single game, leads me little choice but to vote no. Had I known of this issue before I bought the game, I wouldn't have bought it at all.\n\nThe AI issue you can fix somewhat, by locking the teams. But the super weapon issue, there is no fix for, as the mods I've found that allow them to be disabled either don't work at all, or cause the game to crash every 10 minutes or so.\n\nIf all you want to do is rush constantly, every single game, then by all means get the game. But if you prefer longer, but still winable games against 5+ AI, play something else.","January 8","false","35.4"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","12","24","0","6"

Here's my thoughts:\n\nGraphics: 7/10; For a game made more than a couple years ago, it manages to push a rather impressive resolution, detail and ambience. Everything from massive capitol ships and Titans, to small units such as fighter squadrons are well textured, clearly defined and able to give a good visual experience that's both impressive, and incredibly well optimised. So well in fact even older PC's can handle the game on higher graphics levels. Sadly in large scale games with multiple players the game does tend to putz around a bit with the number of items and commands being issued but thats simply a common feature among RTS games.\n\nGameplay: 8/10; RTS at its finest, with a bit of micro-RPG elements attatched to each ship, the game is fun to play, flows well, and encourages good strategy as well as economy management. The controls are a bit much to take in all at once, and it like many other games involving a 4 tier RTS, requires a bit of a learning curve. However, once understood the game is able to flow well, it rewards tactics and an understanding of your opponent, and a satisfying feeling of accomplishment.\n\nSound: 5/10; Its an older game, but the sound effects hold up, and are fairly solid. Listening in on battles is an enjoyable experience and the sound levels are accurate. However some of the more notable abilities used by the Titan units seem unnessecarrily loud, and if listening with headphones can be somewhat deafening if zoomed in close to observe the battle.\n\nAddictiveness and Depth: 4/10; The game suffers from one major flaw. Its absolute lack of a single player campaign. The game has all the makings of what could be a very entertaining single player space domination game, however it is restricted to arena style RTS combat over a set number of worlds against 1 - 7 opponents. The game does have an interactive level up system for Capitol ships, which are allowed to level in a manner you can guide them in by increasing their abilities, and the games heavy amount of depth via a diplomacy system, a working active and live economy, as well as player issued missions, falls by the wayside when faced with the knowledge that the entire games structure is simply a Starship based battle arena.\n\nOverall: 6/10; The games very fun if you can settle into its niche setting. Enjoying well detailed space battles happening in real time is difficult to manage especially with the graphical quality this game manages to provide. However the lack of a single player campaign hits this game hard, and pushes it onto a back burner if you're looking to pick it up. Best to get if you know a friend that plays it as well, or if you enjoy the competition of facing down another player in a 3 Tier RTS game. Only reason this game isnt being reccomended is its heavy reliance on other players for any sort of content.","March 19, 2014","false","61.2"," 63 of 127 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","63","127","0","3"

Other than that, horrid balance, pathfinding and AI, not a big mp crowd on the net. Good for skirmish and mods mostly.\n\nIf you are into few tactics and many useless abilities, constant patching that breaks the balance even further, ridiculously powerful units that will negate your last two hours of effort in building fleet and defences by some magic gimmicky bs, this is definately for you.\n\nIt is a step back (a giant leap for a mankind, though) from gems like Homeworld or any good 4xTBS, but there is nothing else on the market that would actually run without constant crashing or at least would try to represent 4x space srategy, so I give it a "thumbs up".\n\nThe great amount of lore written for this title is wasted, because the game is watered down for multiplayer, so it feels hollow. And since you'd using the same tactic in MP over and over again until a new patch will change it only slightly, you will always win, because if the tactic works literally nothing can beat it. Even the Necrons in early Dark Crusade were more balanced, at least you could win against them if you really tried, here any other tactic except the winning few is useless. No strategic flexibility make this hardly a strategy game.\n\nYou want a good in-depth strategy experience? Play Supreme Commander.Or better yet, find yourself a copy of Homeworld : Cataclysm or maybe Master of Orion.","May 6, 2013","true","137.8"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

A veteran total war player looking to find new RTS games to get away from the dying series that I spent years getting good at. Leaving behind, my friends I'd made, and achievements, to find a new, and refreshing game to take my mind off, if even in a small way. Upon my travels, I venture upon this game......the artwork looks cool, the screenshots look amazing, the description looks epic........but then my eyes wander down to the price tag. For the rather steep price of 39.99.....I can be a galactic tyrant vying for control of the galaxy. I think long and hard on the issue......do I really wanna go back to total war? After some thought, I decide to take a chance....I pay up, and to my hardrive, this magnificant software is installed. I enter the game, and instantly I see promise with a great sound track and breathtaking visuals. I feel so humbled by the new game that has surrounded me in it's atmosphere, and I meekly wander over to the tutorials, where I learn the way of the galactic conquerer. Then I start up a real game, and after only a few adreneline soaked engagements, I am thrilled to know that my money was spent wisely and have no regrets on the risk that I took to experience this game. Ever since that fateful day, this game has been my therepist.....calming my mind with it's awesome gameplay whenever I am stressed. I love this game and have no doubt that anyone with the slightest fanboyism for sci fi and strategy will love this too. I highly recommend this game if you are looking at it's page, wondering the same way I wondered whether or not to take that risk.","December 16, 2014","true","197.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","1"

However I do not recommend purchasing Sins on Steam. The Steam verison is buggy and crashes randomly. Purchase Sins from another third-party vendor, or directly from the developer / publisher.\n\n\nI came across Sins while I was deployed to the middle east, a buddy of mine gave me a pirated copy. I immensely enjoy this game, and I put countless hours into it when I was off-duty. If I had to guess I'd say I played around 8-900 hours over 9 months.\n\nI never had any problems with the game, except for the mulitplayer not working due to it being a pirated copy. It crashed around 7-8 times over 9 months, and most of those were when I was intentionally pushing the game and my computer to their limits. Whether it was single player, LAN, small pre-made maps or huge custom ones, the game worked as it should. I would notice some issues with frame rate late-game, when there would be hundreds of ships on the screen during battles, but that's likely my computer reaching it's upper limits and not any issue with the game engine.\n\nI recently decided to buy Sins in order to support the developers for making a game I have so thoroughly enjoyed. I Downloaded and installed the game, launched it, and the steam bootstrapper kept crashing and rebooting. I didn't restart my computer before attempting to launch the game, and yes I know you should, but I've never had a problem with running a steam game after installing it without restarting. That was the first sign of something being wrong.\n\nI restarted, and that fixed the issue. I get into my first match, a 1v1 on the Gemini medium map, and the game randomly crashes around 20 minutes in. I relaunched and got into another game, this time a 2v2v2 on a huge multi star comp map, and it crashed again at around 90 minutes.\n\nI can count on my hands how many times the pirated copy crashed, over the hundreds of matches I played. The official copy of the game from steam crashed twice in a row in the first two matches. And I bet you my next paycheck it will crash again the next match I play.\n\nA pirated copy of the game is more stable than the steam release. Absolutely pathetic, Valve.\n\nEdit: I have since played 6 more matches, two of which crashed. So Steam Sins is 4 for 8, or 50% failure rate. Going to try reinstalling to see if that fixes the issue for me. Revised some portions of this review, as I wrote this while slightly intoxicated.","April 17","false","20.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","2","5","3","3"

There is almost no planetary development. You can grow population, add some slots for buildings, improve your planet's health all with a couple of clicks. It will take a few minutes to fully develope your planet.\n\nThe research tree is generic. When you build let's say a frigate factory you will unlock one ship type. There is a research tab for every ship in the game for unlock only purpose.  There are 4 tabs alone for upgrading armor, doing the same thing for every tab. Same thing for laser weapons, 3 tabs where every tab is divided into 2 levels ( need to research 1 tab twice) for every incremental increase in laser damage. There is so much unnecessary stuff in the tree that it is just not tech tree worthy as a whole.\n\nExpansion is pretty straightforward take a planet by force or take it over by influence. Panets are connected by phase lanes (strings) over which are you able to move and spread your influence. I'd say diplomacy is the only 4x worthy element this game has to offer and worked out well. You can accept missions to increase their relation with you or you give them a mission to improve your relation with them. If the relation in both ways is high enough the chance of them accepting heavier stuff is more probable.\n\nYou may ask (missions) a faction to destroy ships, capital ships, structures etc and the amount of it. If they kill 5 or 15 enemy ships for you depends on the relationship. You are also able to join pacts. The better the relation, the more pacts you can join like cease fire, peace, vision or trade treaties. Managing your economy is just as thin as in any other RTS, colonize asteroids for metal and crystal income and max out your population for credits.\n\nRTS based gameplayFirst of all there is no singleplayer campaign, it is just pure skirmish against bots and multiplayer. Second point I want to make is that the majority of your game time is spend by battling enemy fleets. Gameplay wise you build up a fleet of mixed unit types. Attack the enemy, lose a big chunk of your fleet, rebuild your fleet and go for the next planet. Flanking does not pay off. There isn't any tactics involved other than timing the activation of your ship's special abilities.\n\nThere is no stealth, no surgical strikes, no flanking. Every game plays out the same, build a big balanced fleet and overwhelm the enemy. Quick building is your way to succes. This is a casual RTS game with extra bells and whistles (4x elements) which lacks strategic depth. The game has good graphics and the battles are nice to see when you are zoomed in, which rarely happens anyway. I did not expect this game to have such a lack of tactical gameplay, such a shame.\n\nFor a casual RTS experience this game is good. Good graphics, flashy space battles, lots of cool units, wonderful sound effects, always things to do, mods and the 4x elements , altough very minor, are a plus. I would not buy the game if you expect a 4x game, total war style of gameplay or the ability to use tactics to decide battles. I would only recommend this game if you want another casual RTS experience (with casual I don't mean quality, but there are more of them on the market in terms of gameplay). I will give this game thumbs down however (has nothing to do with rating but with recommendation), the reason for downvoting is the lack of depth gameplay wise and the bells an whistles don't make up for it.","May 29","false","20.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I hope they make an expansion pack regarding what the Vasari were running from. The Advent faction is my favourite!

This game is a slow ordeal and a simple 1 v 1 match can take up to 3 hours of your time, if not more, but that's where the game strenghts lie.\n\nSins is not meant to be a game where you're sitting at the edge of your seat, it's a game about tactically colonizing planets and researching skills, abilities and constructions that suit your playing style.\n\nIf you want a RTS to relax to and feel extremely rewarded by, then I heartily recommend Sins, if you're unsure, then go watch some gameplay from the game, if you find the video boring, then chances are that you'll find the game boring as well.","May 24, 2013","true","58.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
