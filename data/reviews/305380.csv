See Conclusion\nNOTE: WARNINGThis is not a game for those who are easily offended.  The game describes itself as ‚Äúblack-humored‚Äù, aka 'dark comedy', therefore, it will make light of subject matters usually considered taboo and controversial.\n\nINTRODUCTION:Blue Estate 'The Game' is a first-person rail shooter developed and published by 'HESAW' which serves as the prologue to a comic book series of the same title.  The game features a rail-based shooting mechanic with a story that revolves around black humor, mindless violence, and goofy comic dialogues.\n\nThe game places you in the shoes of Tony Luciano, the son of a big time Italian-American mafia Don. The game also lets you play as Clarence, a former Navy Seal turned hitman for the Luciano family that cleans up after Tony's messes.\n\nPROS:+ Good graphics with a nice comic book art-style\n+ Free comic download that supplements the story\n+ Great humor and witty dialogue however...(See CON #3)\n+ Voice acting is really good with excellent delivery\n+ Very good sound effects\n+ Pop culture references and Easter-eggs add to the humor\n+ Arcade mode and challenges extends game-time...because (See CON #1)\n+ Co-op gameplay\n+ Supports multiple input devices (Kb&M, Gamepads, and Leap Motion, possibly even Light Gun, though I've never tried it)\n\nCONS:- The story is very short...however (See PRO #7)\n- Aim assist cannot be turned off even at the highest difficulty (Patched)\n- The dark humor may not appeal to everyone\n\nNEUTRAL:-/+ The gameplay mechanics of rail shooters didn't really change since the good-ol'-days, however, this game does try to spice things up with some mini-challenges here and there.\n\nCONCLUSION:SURPRISINGLY GOOD for a rail shooter and is a perfect party game if you have a Steam Machine or Living Room PC.  Though some people believe that the genre is from a by-gone age, I think that it just needs a proper subject matter and premise to breathe it new life.\n\nBlue Estate ‚ÄòThe Game‚Äô is a great example on how to make the rail shooter genre relevant in our modern gaming age.  Featuring black (dark) humor with interesting characters and a 'more-or-less' over the top plot, it makes for a good 'B Movie-esque' experience that is both fun and enjoyable.\n\nPriced at a fairly reasonable $12.99 price tag (or your regional equivalent), the game is well worth your attention if you are looking for a casual, arcade, and comical first-person action game.  It doesn't take itself seriously and it brings back the fun and excitement of classical arcade games such as Time Crisis and House of the Dead.  I highly recommend this at FULL PRICE and is a no-brainer during a SALE.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike our Reviews?

So I couldn't help myself and immediately bought it. Are there even more, or is this the only one? If anyone knows more LM games on Steam, please tell me. Well, this is my opinion after playing a bit:\n\nWow, I am honestly impressed. For everyone who has a Leap Motion Controller: go now and buy this game! It surprises me how well this works. You control everything - shooting, switching weapons, picking up items, punching guys - with a single finger. The gesture controls are simple, but really well designed and just work. You don't even have to be that accurate when swiping to bounce back a grenade or something. You really do what you want to do in 99% of all cases. With a single finger. The only exception is taking cover, which needs you to open your hand - and also works flawlessly.\n\nAs i said, this is a must-buy for all Leap Motion Controller owners. And for everybody else, this might also be some fun, since the game itself isn't too bad either. Question is, are you even interested in a rail-shooter, if you have to control it with your mouse? For many gamers the answer will be no, I guess. See it like this: at least it's way cheaper than ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing Rambo, way funnier, and just way better. So if you are even remotely interested in a rail-shooter, this is the better choice of the two. Without a question.\n\nI don't have a lightgun, so I obviously can't say anything about that. But seeing how well they implemented the LM Controller, I just can't imagine that they ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed up the lightgun controls. ^^","April 9, 2015","true","1.7"," 51 of 61 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","51","61","3","3"

It's an action packed shooter, with brilliant commentary and dialogue throughout.\n\nThe game play itself is simple, just aim and shoot, with the added in QTE to dodge other attacks too. There looks to be plenty of replayability too with the arcade mode.

I even (kinda) liked Rambo The Videogame on Steam, and the odd game The Typing of the Dead.\n\nBlue Estate is based on a comic book called "Blue Estate" (duh) created by a guy named Viktor Kalvachev. Doesnt ring a bell for me, but I'm not really into comics so that might explain it.\n\nI've been playing this with mouse/keyboard.\n\nYou start playing with an interesting character named Tony Luciano. Tony is the no-brain son of a mobster boss who gets into a war with another gang called the Silk Brothers. (Later into the game another character is introduced, a merc named Clarence.) The story is insane but not really relevant. It involves a lot of shooting, outrageous scenes, strippers and a horse.\n\nI guess you all know the concept of a railshooter right? You follow a story from scene to scene while shooting down enemies as many as possible. You have your handgun, rifle and shotgun. Leftclick is shoot, rightclick is reload. Arrows are used for cover, melee, collecting items (ammo, guns) and reflecting incoming projectiles.\nYou shoot enemies, bonus items and every now and then there's a bossfight or a shoot-a-mole.\n\nNow why would you get this game? Because its well made. The action is smooth and the graphics, music and voiceacting are great imo. The dark humour might not amuse everyone though, personally I thought it was a hit and miss. Great and terrible at times. The whole game and dialogues are cheesy to the max, the action over-the-top. The characters you'll meet are just... very interesting.\nJust watch the trailer on Steam. It basically covers everything.\n\nOnly downside I see is that I cant play games like this for a long time. I cant play this longer than 45 minutes max. My head explodes and my hand gets too sweaty. Its too hectic and fast.

It's like you're in an action movie and get to shoot everyone, but what to do apart from that is being decided for you (you can actually do some more things when prompted, but you get no say in what to do). The writing and some gimmicks are humorous; basically, if you like the trailer, you're going to like the game. The low difficulty setting seems ok even for casual players.\n\nThis game has local co-op, which means if you have a friend over, they can pick up an Xbox controller and start shooting as well: the goons will spread their shots between you, you get separate health bars, but apart from that it's pretty much single-player with two guns, with the added difficulty of one player having to aim with the thumb-stick instead of a mouse. (Dual mice won't work - I checked.) Maybe it works better if one player or both have a light gun or the leap motion?\n\nIf you want this as a co-op game, I'd advise against it because the co-op is really light-weight, and the guy on the Xbox controller has drawn the short straw; but if you ever want (or need) to play a first-person shooter with only one hand, or you like the style, want to turn your brain off and just  go "blam blam blam" then this game will be fun.","May 31, 2015","true","5.5"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

However if those attributes sound more like pluses than minuses to you than this is def worth snagging, possibly on a sale which it goes on often.\n\nThe story is based on a graphic novel  I've never read  and have no prior experience with but the devs and the art people on this game did a spectacular job of making this game feel and look almost exactly like a graphic novel. So kudos for that. Visually it is an incredibly  interesting experience and even though it's an on-rails game which has been done 1,000 times the art direction in it really sets it apart and exudes a vibe that is truly unique.\n\nTechincally it's sound  as far as I can tell. It ran at a stable framerate and I encountered no bugs during my playthrough. (i5/gtx690/16gb RAM)\n\nThe only real downside was that it's a tad on the short side. I beat it on normal in 4 hours or so. However there are some challenges and varying difficulties to conquer so if someone really did want to throw a ton of time in to it and perfect their skill at it they could.\n\nAll in all the mix of bullets, booty, and high-color graphic novel style served as a fitting throw back to macho action movies and cabinet shooters of old and I thoroughly enjoyed my time mowing down the horde as the repentless Tony.\n\n9/10Blue Estate set out to be a graphic novel+on rails shooter and it overachieved in reaching that goal. The only downside is it's a tad short but if bought on sale, which it goes on often and at a deep discount, the length shouldn't bother you at all.","May 4","true","4.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","1"

It's crazy fun and stylish.\n\nThe story is the prologue of Blue Estate comic. The game fills with heavy narrative and cheesy dialogue of two main characters blazing through horde of mobsters in main seven long levels.\n\nThe gameplay is main fun core of the game. You will be able to switch between two weapons in each level. Each weapon gives different advantages and firepower feels very satisfied.\n\nThe gunplay is very solid as you shoot enemies on the scene, avoid object, doing fast gesture, and slow-motion with very well level design and movement script. These elements push the action to the top and keep you busy all the time. The score system also adds replayability and gives feeling of big scoring. And arcade mode will test your aim reaction. Thanks to well optimization and porting which make both mouse and gamepad control are well responsive.\n\nHowever, the game itself feels letdown in last level and sometimes first-person weapon can be your perspective obstacle.\n\nIf you‚Äôre familiar with other rail shooter like, Virtual Cop, Time Crisis, or HOTD. I‚Äôm pretty sure this game will offer you a great experience of arcade shooter as you expect for a long time.","April 9, 2015","true","5.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

The developers had opted  to utilise the Dual Shock 4's built in motion to control your aiming. But it felt awkward and it was no surprise every second comment on the Playstation Blog urged the developer to implement Playstation Move, which at the time of this review hasn't been patched int the PS4 version.\n\nDespite the control issues, I was in love with the game's B-grade tone and no thrills game play, so when a PC version was announced with mouse controls, I jumped on the couch, threw my arms in the air and said yeeehaaa!!!\n\nThe PC port gives you a choice of 32bit or 64bit version plus V-sync, adjustable resolution and three graphical settings (low, medium, hard). This is to be expected from a port of a console game. Control options include a mouse, 360 controller and supported light guns, which sadly I don't own the latter for my PC. Mouse is the way to go, especially since you can do almost every input and quick time event with just the mouse, no need to use the keyboard, although the option is still there.\n\nWith the controls and graphic options out of the way, let's talk about the actual game. As I mentioned before Blue Estate has a B-grade feel with the story starting with an Italian mobster trying to get his prized stripper back. Blue Estate stirred up quite a bit of controversy with it's racial undertones, sexism and cheesy jokes. See what these critics failed to do, was switch off their brain and learn to laugh at the fake Italian accents, sex jokes and general craziness. Every AAA game and film tends to look the same, but B-grade stuff is so dodgy, it has a charm of it's own and same can be said about Blue Estate. Movie buffs will also enjoy some of the nods to various films and directors.\n\nBlue Estate is an on-rail shooter, meaning the character moves automatically and your only job is to shoot everything that moves. I love Blue Estate, because it doesn't try to over-complicate the formula with RPG mechanics, stealth or innocent hostages like Rambo or Heavy Fire. If it moves, you shoot it and that's basically it. The way it should be.\n\nThe production values of Blue Estate are quite impressive for a $13 game: catchy music, strong voice overs and is powered by the Unreal Engine with surprisingly good textures.\n\nIt's no surprise the story mode can be finished in 3 hours, after all it's a $13 game. The game also local co-op (sadly no online), multiple difficulties levels and an arcade mode to fill your boots up, if you're hungry for more.\n\nOverall Blue Estate delivers a basic, but enjoyable on-rail shooter that at least has decent production values and some evidence of care, which can't be said about Heavy Fire or Rambo. Obviously the racial undertones and sexism will offend many people, but if you switch your brain off, I guarantee you will have a good time with this one, mate.","May 23, 2015","true","3.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The stylized art is fairly attractive, with characters and locations both well-realized. Some of the jokes are worth a chuckle.\n\nIf you like on-rails lightgun-style games, this uses the style and adds a few wrinkles in in-level minigames, quicktime-style events, and switchable weapons.\n\nThe bad: You might note that as of this review, I've played "Blue Estate" for 2.9 hours. That is about how long it took to complete it on "normal" difficulty, going through eight stages.\n\nYou can make a good game that only takes 2.9 hours to complete. But despite the aforementioned attempts at humor, the running narrative, the weapon changes, etc., this amounts to 2.9 hours of fairly same-y game play in "story" mode, leading abruptly into a conclusion that rather obviously doesn't "conclude" anything plot-wise; neither character has accomplished anything towards their alleged goals by the end, and one is explicitly stated to be heading straight for new troubles.\n\nHaving completed the game, there's very little reason to stick around. Do you want to memorize enemy patterns so maybe you can get a four-star rating on each level? Play it at a harder difficulty so you can die slightly more often? Listen to the whiny-voiced narrator (whose annoying-ness the game attempts to mine for humor, with frequent interruptions "apologizing" for or "muting" him, as though the game wasn't responsible for the very quality it mocks) go through his schtick a second time?\n\nI don't hate this game, but there are better offerings out there, even in this genre. "Typing of the Dead: Overkill" offers both a typing and a rail-shooter with a longer play time, better script, and more interesting boss fights. Call me if they offer a sequel that actually concludes... and then patch things to tie the two together.","April 13, 2015","false","2.9"," 59 of 103 people (57%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","57","59","103","7","9"

It's essentially a Tarantino flick gone on-rails shooter, and a glowing love letter to the heydays of arcade shooters like "Time Crisis" and "The House of the Dead". The console release got a lot of slack by major review outlets for its alleged racism, misogyny and overall 'tasteless' humor (I'm looking at you, IGN...) -- which led to review scores mainly reflecting the authors' disapproval of the game's cynical tone rather than its actual gameplay qualities. However, while "Blue Estate" might present its whimsical world and d-o-u-c-h-e-bag delinquents in a crass manner, I wouldn't deem any of its content overtly offensive -- particularly not when compared to other politically-incorrect games like GTAV or Saints Row.\n\nThe visuals, utilizing the tried-and-true Unreal 3 Engine, are splendid and perfectly capture the title's comic roots. It's not a particularly 'next-gen' looking game in terms of textures and effects, but its sleek, vibrant look, somewhere along the lines of "The Darkness II" and "Saints Row 2", greatly intertwines with the comic-stills footage.\n\nThe story is nothing to write home about, just all your mafia film cliches in a nutshell, really (one-man army vs. cannon fodder, la familia is law, shoot first etc.). Yet it's delivered in an exaggerated and charmingly whacky way that makes for a jolly good time. Protagonist Tony Luciano is a complete m-o-r-o-n as well as a psychopath, but you'll grow fond of him eventually as the silly plot unfolds.\n\nThe KB+mouse controls are spot-on, and, most importantly for an on-rails shooter, the locations are varied and colorful while the enemy/boss encounters needn't shy away from any free-roaming FPS. Even the QTE segments, which prompt you to either use directional buttons or your mouse, are fun since the game is surprisingly responsive to your inputs/motions.\n\nUltimately, your enjoyment of "Blue Estate" might hinge on whether you can appreciate its deliberately cheesy, self-aware humor and stereotyped characters. Political/social white knights will likely find no value in it.\nBut, merely judged on its (niche) genre merits, it's a near-flawless experience, and arguably the best on-rails shooter since "The House of the Dead: Overkill".\n\nHere's to hoping we'll see a sequel.\n\n8/10","April 10, 2015","true","4.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","2"

Arcade mode is probably the most fun, if you're looking for a quick fix.\n\nI played the campaign using a mouse and keyboard, but I felt like something was missing.  An on-rail shooter doesn't require light guns to be fun, but I think it would bring the experience to that arcade level.\n\nI recommend this game if you were a fan of just about any on-rails shooter from the 90's.

I am not a big fan of rail shooters (excluding Time Crisis), but i have to say this is one that got everything right. The shooting mechanic is spot on, almost no lag to the move of the mouse. Just point and shoot and you make your target. Next, the moving in the game is very fluid like. It doesn't make the player lose track of the character, or the constant action that is happening all the time around you. You know exactly where the character is, where he is gonna go, and where he has been. It's not awkward movements that most rail shooters offer, which confuse the player, and make him/her ask questions on the surroundings. If you don't play for the gameplay, and need more, this game has what ever you want. The amount of fourth wall breaks is amazing, and they happen in the best of times. Enough to make you or anyone "lolz." I have not played enough to get into the story, but I cant already tell it will be a great one. Guns. Nudity. Hilarious jokes and comedy. Dead people everywhere.

Why?  Because Rail shooters do not show up on personal computers because people do not find great thrills in mouse clicking people to death or using a thumb controller to do the same.\n\nBlue Estate is a happy middle between Time Crisis & House of the Dead Overkill on the Wii.  The graphics are outstanding and the developers are also on board to help anyone who wants to use other devices to play the game besides a mouse or controller.\n\nI of course, as I am hopefully more famous for, use Mic's wiimoteoncod9.exe (see our group page).  It runs perfect and the game does have varying degrees of difficulty.  The stages are rife with cut scenes but thankfully they are not that long or interrupt the gameplay too much.\n\nIt plays perfectly like an arcade shooter, which is what it SHOULD DO.  It doesn't pretend to be anything else.\n\nHere is some good wiimoteoncod9 video of play:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=524-e3B2Buw\n\nFor who is this game for?  Enthusiasts who are willing to do a little more effort to use this game on PC with something that looks like a gun.  It is also for old school arcade gamers.  It is also for people who like the genre of noir with a fat slice of silly.\n\nI recommend this game, it is really cheap(seriously 12 bucks) and please support the developers.  Because if they do well, they'll make more and maybe next time with dedicated IR support :D","April 10, 2015","true","8.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","8","11","2","0"

I would recommend this to anyone who asked me if the game was worth buying at a discounted price.

The genre of rail-shooters has become nothing but poor, unimaginative, lack luster cash grabs in recent times. This game generaly tries to inovate, and it does. For instance, look at "the swipe to interact" system.\n\nWhen I first saw this feature, I thought it would be annoying, but I couldn't be more wrong. You use it to kick open doors, punch machete wielding thugs, pickup shotguns, get health, or knock grenades back at their throwers.\n\nI have never liked a rail-shooter more than I like this game. This a genre that I've loved since my child hood, and this game has restored my faith in the genre. I've only reached the third level, and I've been smileinge the whole time. If you like comedy and fun shooting, you like this game. Keep in mind this is definetly a fourteen and up game. Ya know, strippers, nutshots, chihuahuas on steroids.\n\nAnd going back to the Action, it's great, tere are times you will literally be swiping the hair out of your characters eyes. I have never found a character more relateable. And do you like it when your player character talks ocassionally? Then you won't like this, Because they never shut up! I freaking love how outspoken Tony and Clarence are.

With nice voice acting and jokes littering everywhere, it is certainly a game that will make you smile.\nBefore you say rail gun shooting game is a dying business, Blue Estate could not disagree more than our antagonist Tony himself. Oh, did I just say antagonist?\nThe graphics here is good and solid. Character facial expressions and voice acting are great. Funny remarks, ironies, metaphors, politics‚Ä¶ OK, you name it, they have it.\nHeadshot is a common thing, but being able to nutshot? That‚Äôs awesome!\n\nGameplay\n\nTaking the role as Tony and Clarence, you are here to wreak havoc. All of this, started with the kidnapping of Tony‚Äôs favourite poledancer, Cherry. With intermittent black humor and swipe actions in-between gun fights, explosions, Chihuahua, bullet proof samurai‚Ä¶Oh well, you get the idea.\nBlue Estate does have a unique way to separate itself from the other railgun shooters. The thing that keeps you playing is not how the story is unfolding, yet it is all about the funny bits and pieces that are still to come.\nThis game offers 2 game modes, the story mode comprises of 7 missions and the arcade mode. The arcade mode has a timer and is refreshed every time you killed an enemy. This fast paced version of the game is a test of skill with the humor taken away from it.\nFor doubling the fun, the game also allows local multiplayer with another person and can be played with various controllers including Xbox Controllers, the Leap Motion controller and light-gun.\nHowever, with all the good being said, this game lacks one of the most important elements in today‚Äôs gaming: Character progression and upgrades. There are many things the developer can do to increase the fun, simply by leaving a few tweaks for players to fiddle with. For example, crazy weapon customization, even more stupid looking enemies and may be‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶more Chihuahuas.\n\nSummary,\n\nIn summary, this game is a very much enjoyable shooter that is good for not so serious gamers or those that are looking for some relaxing moments with your best friends. As Jin Bong Sik once said: Insolent Missile!\n\n","April 9, 2015","true","3.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/recommended/305380/","Dravvad","Dravvad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/","218 products in account","The general question is simply: Do I recommend other people to play it? Short answer: No.\n\nLong answer: Depends! Last time I played an on-the-rail shooter was in an arcade many years ago, and I've played many of them before. Do I think they're generally fun? Yes. Do I think this game is that fun? Not really.\n\nThe humor of this game didn't really strike me much, except for a few scenes here and there. So I guess one of my biggest problems with the game is simply that it didn't "click" with me, and not much else I can do on that end. However, I'm sure there are many people that would find it to be hilarious.\n\nBut besides that, I also just didn't like much of the Story mode of the game. Some of my dislikes go along with the humor, but they also affected the gameplay - for instance, Tony's hair always falling down in front of the camera as a cheap gag got really annoying really quickly. It isn't necessarily difficult to move it away, but that doesn't mean it can't get bothersome.\n\nIn terms of positives, the game does have some nice graphics and sound, and the voice acting isn't bad. But in terms of negatives, beyond what I just mentioned, the game had some performance lag for me occasionally but it didn't seem to be my PC as far as I could tell. And also, certain parts got really annoying when the camera would fly around in multiple directions really quickly. As I said early on, I understand it's an on-the-rail shooter, but sometimes it is a little too over-the-top, and I'm not a person who enjoys "perfecting" those scenarios.\n\nI do have to say that I enjoyed the Arcade better than the Story simply because some of those complaints I have above didn't exist in that; that is because the level playthroughs were a bit different. But in the long run, I wouldn't tell friends to buy this game, especially not at full price.","February 14","false","6.4"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

Or Arcade-cabinets for that matter. I do and I found myself looking back at those times long passed as I was playing Blue Estate the game. Giving me nostalgic memories, Is one of the surefire ways of getting my approval. HOWEVER, it is also one of the most effective ways of getting burned at the stake if they soil those memories.\n\nLuckily for HE SAW, they managed to avoid the latter.\n\nBlue Estate is a great blast from the past, giving back the good name of rail-shooters and arcade shoot'em'ups. I won't go over the story, since what there is, is minimal at best. Let's just summarize it into: A pulpy, over the top, humorous, d-movie, with a lot of shooting thrown in. The game is based on a comic, however I haven't had the pleasure of reading it.\nBut, I can say. That if the comics are as fun as the game, they will be added to my collections post-haste.\n\nBut what about the game? Well, I think it's already obvious that I love this game. And everything I say must be adhered with a good measure of bias.\n\nThe game is short for what it is, but can it be blamed for it? I shall paraphrase "I would rather pay for a short and well constructed piece, than something made to take hundreds of hours." And that works with this game. Although it took me  under 4 hours to finish the game on normal difficulty, including the arcade modes. I can say that I enjoyed it greatly.\n\nThe game ran well on my PC, right now I'm downloading it onto my laptop. So i will update the post afterwards to tell you how it ran.\n\nEDIT: Laptop.\nAfter setting quality to low, it ran fine. Once again, it is the integrated Graphics-chip that is the hurdle. (Intel HD Graphics)\n\nThe games visual quality is pretty good, however I did notice some strange blurriness with some areas. Otherwise the game ran perfectly fine, there were no noticeable framedrops anywhere (PC). (Unreal Engine at work..)\n\nThe games voice-acting is wonderfully cheesy, giving the characters some great personality. The music is somewhat mediocre at some points, however it manages to settle well with the areas. Giving them a bit more life than you would normally see in a rail-shooter.. NO! I SHALL NOT SAY THE NAME OF "THAT" GAME. NO! ARGH!!\n\nAnyway, where was I?\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend Blue Estate enough. The price 13‚Ç¨ might be a bit steep for some people, especially considering the games length. However I personally feel that the gameplay in itself is a good reason to get the game. The story is a bit so-and-so, but it gives a few good laughs and snorts, with its somewhat silly references now and again.\n\n\nFor those who want some funny and enjoyable arcade fun, Blue Estate is the game for you.","May 13, 2015","true","4.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Blue Estate is hands down the Funniest game I've played in a while. The humour is fresh, rude and even vulgar. Slapstic and witty one liners fill the game making for a laugh every minute. The gunplay is satisfying, you are able to build up score multiplyers to reach ridiculous scores. There are minimal guns and a few boss fights. The only complaint i have about Blue Estate is that the game is too short, however it is not ridiculously over priced like Rambo: The Video Game. I highly recommend this game, there are some moments of pure comedy gold that I do not want to spoil in a review.

If you don't know a lick about the comic this is based on, you needn't worry (though you should do yourself a favor and also check it out for the gorgeous artwork alone), the writing in this has you in mind. The writing and production quality might veer off into the adolescent (sup stripper femme fatale pole dancing right on the start menu!), but it's surprisingly well done and put together beautifully. I thought it'd be a lot more "budget" quality considering how little I've actually heard of this game around the internet, but man am I happy to be proven wrong.

So many past titles have made such a mess of this category that a lot of people stayed away from the genre. So Im glad that Blue Estate did it right, brought life back to rail-shooters, and reset the standards.\n\nEvery games' biggest challenge is replayability. And rail shooters are especially hard to corner that arena. But Blue Estate challenges you jsut enough to want to go back and replay levels just to get higher scores. I just finished a level and I was trying to get my accuracy as high as possible. I swore I was up to at least 60% accuracy. Nope. Turns out I was only at 44%. Dammit. Now I have to go back and replay the level. And I also have to get all the little bonuses that I missed (watched them slide out of view before shooting them and thinking "Crap!")\n\njust get this game. The price is right and you will not be disappointed. Seriously. You get bonuses for shooting guys in the nuts. So far, as a rail shooter, it is absolutely perfect. The writing is good too. Sometimes games go over the top with their ridiculousness. This one doesnt. It takes it right to it's appropriate boundaries of stupid and stays there threatening to jump over the line.","May 30, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yeah, so typically I wouldn't touch them with a ten-foot pole because the premise seems rather boring. I enjoyed the first Umbrella Chronicles game on the Wii, and I enjoyed CarnEvil in the arcades, but otherwise, I just dismissed the genre...until I watched a "let's play" of Jim Sterling playing through the first level of Blue Estate. Oh my word, this game's pedigree and production values are what all rail shooters should strive for. If you already like the genre, you should buy this when it's a price you're comfy with, because it's grand.\n\nWhat's so great about it? Well, you play as two different characters throughout the game, and there are other characters involved as well, either present with your character in the level, or over a radio. Not only that, but you have a *very* geeky private eye narrating and adding commentary, as well as sarcastic and witty remarks from the "Federal Bureau of Procrastincation," if memory serves.  There's plenty of dialog, tons of action, some of which is quite stylized, a unique gun on every level which you can use as long as you have ammo, or else you default back to your infinite ammo normal guns (but if you're careful with your shots, you'll rarely run out and can use the ammo guns almost the whole time!).\n\nLast but not least...the humor. This game is hilarious. Obviously, everyone has a different sense of humor, but I laughed aloud on multiple occasions and found myself smirking or grinning through much of the game. The comedy and gunplay go hand in hand as a real treat, and I'm so glad I finally played this game. I'm sure I'll end up circling back and playing through it again sometime in the future, because I had a great time with it, and it's just so charming with all of its comedy, action, and brevity. I dare say this may be the finest rail shooter I've ever played.","September 12, 2015","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Blue Estate is of course a fast paced rail shooter based off of Victor Kalvachevs graphic novel of the same name which feature charcters such as Tony Luciano, Cherry Popz, and Clarence. This game feels more like a promotion done right because every moment I played it was truly intoxicating with the humor and gun play. Now I do wish it wasnt a rail shooter but its overall incredible fun. Although I haven't read any of the books this game is making me want to buy a few only to engross myself into the universe of Blue Estate.\n\nNow comes the bad which is this game is very short (3 hours to be exact) and dosen't really offer nothing more than arcade mode and a difficulty mode. Also Clarence is almost very uninspired and boring lacking what made me love Tony Luciano. The charcters portrayal of a stereotypical ugly american italian mafioso is just icing on his comedic preformance from his racial slurs down to his shoot first ask questions later attitude.\n\nI can and obviously will recommend this game to anyone looking for a good laugh in the beggining but to be sure to fall asleep in the middle as Clarence.","February 11","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And even while the game stays true to the simple premise of on-rails shooter games, it still provides variety within each level, as the player has moments where they can take cover to protect themselves and on other times the only protection they have is being a quick shot. The swipe motions, albeit not being anything too game-changing, does add an extra layer to the gameplay, but even more so are the special in-game moments like Shoot-a-mole or Showdown, where the player has to do something in specific like take enemies down in a specific order or pay attention to quickly shoot an enemy as he comes out of hiding.\n\nThe story is completely packed with humor in a way that it doesn't feel cheap - it's not mindless jokes thrown around randomlessly, it's actual humor included within the game's story, both when it comes to character dialogue and certain funny moments during each level.\n\nCouch coop is, gladly, included - two players can play together with a keyboard, mouse and/or controller... And even a light gun, for those who do own one.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about the game is how they set the weapon change command to double clicking the right mouse button and it can't be changed, which can be a problem sometimes as a single right click is the command for reloading. Would be a lot better if I could just reload with R and change weapons with a single right click instead. Still, it's just a matter of getting used to it.","January 6","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love light gun games, games such as time crisis, house of the dead and virtua cop were among some of my favorite games period and i feel that this genre has been left out in the cold for far too long.\n\nThis game plays very much like virtua cop, were it focuses on accuracy and precision rather than a duck and cover mechanic like in time crisis. Head shots are key to getting combos quickly and timing your reload is paramount to survival. Often you'll be met with on screen notifications showing you where to swipe the screen, these come individually, in quick succession or continuous like spinning a valve to open a gate. You can only carry two weapons which is a shame, though you won't need a lot of weapons anyway. The style of the game reminds me of house of the dead overkill, which had a grind house feel to it. So for the most part the game doesn't take itself seriously and perhaps you shouldn't either.\n\nIf you like light gun games, do yourself a favor, get this game and a aimtrak light gun http://www.ultimarc.com/store/section.php?xSec=7 you won't regret it, and please don't use a mouse and keyboard or xbox controller you'll only be experiencing a fraction of the fun if you do so.","April 24","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Full of lewd humor, violence, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, guns, and political incorrectness.  These game developers know what you horny, high ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s crave and have given it to you.....\n\nAnd honestly, the rest of the game is worth playing through as well.  The shooter is challenging, made more-so by the constant barrage of bad humor, asses and greasy hair in your face.  (Vulcans may be exempt from this particular element of challenge.)  It's a fun experience that will take you back to the good ole days at the arcade, shooting side-by-side with some buddies as enemies pop out of the backdrop.  Two different play modes, an entertaining campaign and arcade mode, both worth playing through.

Yes, a rail shooter, powered by the Unreal Engine, and it was used to very good effect as you shoot your way through waves and waves of goons, and a few boss battles. The game does not take it self seriously, as the characters, based on a graphics novel, are over the top bad, combined with sitcom dialogs and hilarious plot developments. The action is also excellent, complete with occasional minigames (shooting based, of course!) to raise your combo score. Bosses are also attacked in a similar fashion: half joke, half serious. The result is a very satisfying shooter, that you sort of which was a little longer, but the existing levels are VERY long.\n\nAny way, you play either as Tony Luciano, son of the local Mafioso... except you're never doing anything... proper. The only thing you can do well is shoot. On half of the levels you play as Clarence, ex-SEAL now mercenary. Any way, Tony starts the game shooting his way into a bad Chinese Restaurant operated by, uh... I honestly can't tell what are those two Asian goon leaders were supposed to be. Any way, you shoot your way through the restaurant looking for your stripper sweetie. The story was supposedly being told by some PI relaying a story from the stripper, so you'll often get disclaimers, "clarifications", commentary, and so on to set the mood. Yes, all this is in game. As Tony shoot his way through the restaurant, goons appearing from every direction, Tony can only rely on his trusty Desert Eagle... and later, the occasional shotgun. Clarence has a silence pistol (unknown caliber, probably a .45 or Baretta) and gets to use a Winchester rifle (yep, lever action, from the Old West) and even later, SMG, and SCAR-L (the military rifle with suppressor).\n\nAs you work your way through the level, each level has bonus objectives, usually some symbol, for you to shoot as sort of "collectible". Bonus items have to be "swiped" (either with controller gesture or with WASD keys) which can also act as QT event moves to dodge, jump, vault, etc. There are occasional bonus moves you can perform in game (the Chihuaua one are funny, at least the first few times around).\n\nEnemies can be shot as soon as they appear on screen. If a reticule appear on them, that means they are almost ready to shoot, and you should target them ASAP. Items that can be shot, such as locks, chains, and so on that are mission critical  have a translucen flashing outline about them for you to see. There are bonuses for total eradication (kill every target on the map), wait till last minute (danger close), dodgy (never got hit), and more.\n\nThere are only a handful of levels but each level is VERY long or at least it felt very long. Enemies are armed with variety of weapons, from pistols to shotguns to SMGs to grenades and assault rifles. Some may even melee you by rushing you with machetes. And they do pop out of nowhere, sort of. Each level has something new. A level with bees (shooting it will distract the enemies for you to deal with others), a level with\n\nThe engine game is served with "style", a certain bravado that's hard to find in game nowadays, so it is very refreshing, despite it being a rail shooter.\n\nUsually not my cup of tea, but it's fun enough I bought it, and I do enjoy it very much.","December 14, 2015","true","3.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

With a brief resurgence featuring House of the Dead overkill & Dead Space in the last gen there has not really been a stalwart of the genre in a long time. Enter Blue Estate the Game and let me start by saying that Blue Estate is my favourite rail shooter of all time.\n\nThe best way to describe Blue Estate the Game is Duke Nukem meets Time Crisis with Mafia stuff rather than Aliens. You probably already know if this is going to be your kind of game so firstly lets start by saying It does not revolutionise the genre, this isn‚Äôt some mind bending genre re-imagining but what it is the most enjoyable example of the genre I have ever played.\n\nThe game is broken into a number of different sections and sees you playing 2 characters. One of the key things about the game that really makes it stand out from other games in the genre is the gunplay. The guns in this game all feel distinctively different.\n\nThe story is openly ridiculous and is one of the main issues I have head people moaning about on the internet but to be honest as long as you take it for what it is and that‚Äôs absolute silliness its an enjoyable story to follow. You start the tale as Tony who is heading over to a Yakuza style strip bar after your head stripper at your skin joint was kidnapped. This then spills out into trying to recover Blue Estate the Head of the Mafia‚Äôs prize racehorse. Other sections of the game see you play as Clarence an ex-navy seal turned hit-man trying to clean up the mess started by Tony.\n\nThe game is enjoyable, fast and doesn't outstay its welcome. Controlling the game with the mouse works excellently and makes it play more like an FPS and the guns feel great.\n\nThere are also some enjoyable scenes where the game gives you bonus points for doing things such as killing enemies in a specific order and quickly stopping a Chihuahua from humping your leg‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt ask. These work well and up the game's enjoyment. There are also hidden objects in each scene that you gain extra points for shooting which add to the replay story.\n\nAt ¬£9.99 or your regional equivalent I feel this is excellent value for what you get. Sure this isn‚Äôt the longest story but when you consider how much say buying a Blu-ray or a trip to the cinema costs suddenly the price seems a lot more reasonable.\n\nBlue Estate is by far the best rail shooter I have ever played and while it will not necessarily convert the masses for fans of the genre or someone looking for something which is fast, fun and different to your usual titles I cannot recommend it enough.","April 11, 2015","true","3.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

This game exceeded my expectations and brings back all the nostalgia from classic rail shooters I played in my childhood.\n\nIt is action-packed with barely any moment to rest your trigger finger. Enemies pop out all over the screen, shooting and charging at you and you have to combine swiping with shooting to take them down quickly. It is a thrill racking up insane scores and challenging yourself with each playthrough to reach the top of the leaderboards.\n\nBlue Estate is full of comedic humor, with absurd characters and dialogue that remind me of the Saints Row franchise. Intense music that fit the action helps guide the player along on an adrenaline-fueled ride. It is one of the best shooter games I have played in a long time and I highly recommend it to both new and old fans of the rail-shooter genre.","April 17, 2015","true","3.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rmzfm/recommended/305380/","rmzfm","rmz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rmzfm/","259 products in account","Blue Estate is an on-rails shooter, the kind that is quite uncommon today. This Steam version is a re-release of the XBone version. The story is rather corny and the story missions are rather bland, but the game shines in arcade mode. It's actually more fun than House of the Dead.\n\nThe story mode is sometimes fun even if rarely funny, but as I mentioned the missions are too long and drag on and on. Fortunately there is the arcade mode. I was so bored after running through the story mode, which took me around 3hrs, that I almost missed the arcade mode completely. That would be a mistake as the arcade mode is great fun. Fast paced, crazy headshot nutshot extravaganza. Fun!\n\nVISUALS\n\nEverything seems pretty enough. It looks amazing compared to the last HotD, but then HotD was so horribly horrible that anything would look better. Fact is Blue Estate is quite nice to look at and smooth at all times. The levels are not that complex but still good looking.\n\nAUDIO\n\nNice music all along, nothing spectacular but fitting the game pretty well. Sounds are allright, weapons sound cartoony, but meaty enough. Voice acting is spot on. All in all everything is aok in the audio department.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe game controls surprisingly good albeit it has some sort of auto-aim which was a bit weird at first but quite handy later. The story mode is a bit fun-ish, but the diminishing returns quickly kick in and after a few minutes every minute is less enjoyable than the previous one. In the arcade mode you revisit some of the locales from the story mode and pop heads for high scores.\n\nIf you like on-rails shooters play this one. It's not an amazing game by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a guilty pleasure worthy of some monies.\n\nBlue Estate - Random Game Footage:\nhttps://youtu.be/fJn6jv1-EKk","October 12, 2015","true","6.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

On the one hand, it's funny and even clever at times.  On the other, a lot of the "sliding actions" are annoying and unnecessary, such as flinging your long hair out of your face.  The graphics are serviceable, nothing to write home about.  The plot, characters, dialogue, and voice acting is on point.  If you're looking for a funny game, look no further.\n\nIf you're looking for a balls to the wall rail shooter, well, it works, but it could be better.  In many cases, you feel like you're just going through the same room again and again, just from different angles.  This is a game that will please people looking for a chuckle, but leave rail shooter enthusiasts with apathy.

A score system rewards mostly lightning quick reflexes. No tricks like Operation GHOST's stupid 1 second enemy jumps in while you're tagging 5 second enemies or nonsense like that.

If you are not digging the humor / story (and I don't) Blue Estate becomes a chore - which is insane considering that lightgun-shooters used to be fast and exciting back in the arcade (still considering House of the Dead 2 a gift from the gods).\n\nThis game is not a complete trainwreck, but it could have been so much better. It lacks style / flash - shooting stuff just rarely feels really good and exciting. Headshots, nutshots or whatever could have used more oomph! Why is there a cooldown on reloading? ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• needs to go click-click-boom! Not click. Cooooooooldown. Click. Boom. It takes forever (compared to proper oldschool stuff). And the levels... man, those levels - so long and boring. It takes me about 40 minutes to blast my way through House of the Dead 2, and it is entertaining and all about variety. Blue Estate has 8 Levels that take 20 to 30 minutes EACH and are super-samey - it gets so boring shooting the same guys all over again while running in circles through the same areas a couple of times. Really bad.\n\nJust do yourself a favour and grab "Typing of the Dead: Overkill" which contains the full "House of the Dead: Overkill" and get your proper arcade-railshooting fix.","July 31, 2015","false","2.4"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","0"

You shoot at the bad guys, occasionally take cover, reload, pop out and shoot more guys, rinse repeat.\n\nIt is generally pretty funny, and the set pieces are varied enough that you don't get too bored, but the gunplay is lacking a bit, which is not a great sign when the gunplay is your whole game, essentially. Also, the main characters hair keeps flopping down over your eyes in game, requiring you to push a button to flick it back, which is annoying.\n\nSo basically, it's bad.\n\nBut then, remember it's meant to be silly and not to be taken too seriously, and now it's still not particularly good.\n\nBut it's not bad.","April 24, 2015","false","1.9"," 6 of 21 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","6","21","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/left4dinner2/recommended/305380/","left4dinner2","Law Abiding Engineer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/left4dinner2/","144 products in account","Blue Estate. Boy oh boy oh boy, where do I even start with this one. Initial thoughts were that it was an interesting shooter with decent graphics and all and then the trailer showed that it had some humor, but that's about as good as the trailer gets. The real fun starts as soon as you actually start the first level.\n\nBlue Estates is suppose to be based off of some novel and the plot revolves around a few mobster families fighting over various things such as a race horse (can't say name or else minor spoiler), a sexy busty Japanese dancer (super sexy), and other things. The game genre is known as a rail shooter, which you rarely hear about four a few reason. One, is that they are linear. People these days seem to gate linear things because of their freedoms as this, their freedoms as that. If you're too anal about that, then move along. If not, then listen up. The point of rail shooters is at the very least, to force you into situations where you have to adapt, and you get to see exactly what the creator wanted you to see. Anyway, enough ramble, time to review.\n\n\nGameplay: As stated earlier, its a rail shooter, so in each level you start off with a pistol that has infinite ammo. That's just standard protocall. Through out the level, you occasionally come across another weapon that can be used but with limited ammo. These are usually shotguns, ARs, rifles, and stuff like that. You move from place to place, and have to defend yourself against a lot of enemies as they charge after you, or pop up out of no where and shoot at you. Due to the nature of the game, and that having true unassisted aim would make the game really difficult for some gamers, they have a very generous aim system in which you have to aim close to the head with a general crosshair, and then allow the small crosshair to adjust slightly enough to get hopefully a headshot. This might make the game seem easy, but when enemies bob around, it can be hard to even get a lock on them so just good ol' aimming is required.\n\nWhile in the levels, there are times where you have to do minor interactive things that are not exactly QTEs, but they involve moving the mouse in directions, or keyboard bindings. An example is that when the main Italian guy is running around, he sometimes has his long hair get in the way. A simple swipe, and poof, its moved. Opening a door, just swipe left and right and tah dah. Ammo and health packs are plentiful, maybe too plentiful, but they can be ignored if you please.\n\nGraphics: The trailer and screenshots show it all. Not super ultra HD 4k texture stuff, but enough to be fun and cartoony enough to enjoy.\n\nSounds: The music, while simple is very effective at setting the mood and changes as you progress. The voice actors for the game, are amazing. Each of the characters have an unique enough voice to easily know who is who, and you don't even need to know a thing about them to figure out what type of person they are. Also, the humor, oh god the humor in this game is flat-out, hilarious. If you don't find a moment in the game to laugh about, then seriously, something's wrong with you.  No, Im serious, how could someone not find one part of the game funny? The humor is raunchy at times, but very clever and witty. There are a few moments that might rub people the wrong way, but the humor is done in good taste and pokes fun at all sorts of people.\n\n\nOverall: Rail shooters have been an old-school game genre that have not gotten a lot of love, nor respect that they rightfully deserve. This game proves that the genre is not dead, and that you can enjoy a linear game with tons of humor. While I have yet to try the game on the hardest setting, I feel like the game is a bit too easy BUT you can make it harder by not picking up health packs, maybe not hiding while reloading, and stuff like that. This is definitely a good game that Im afraid will get bashed because the console version of it, didn't have the best of reviews, but still, this is PC version, not console. The price is one hell of a bargain for this, and if you enjoy rail shooters, humor, and a silly but fun story, then get this.","April 10, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The presentation of it all makes the big action sequences actually pretty intense and awesome to play out, what with the loud music and explosions and guys dropping dead left and right.  Most of the guns are punchy and feel satisfying to shoot, and the acrobatics your character tends to pull off (one much more than the other) lends to that real action-antihero badass feel.  The tension of the fact that you are pretty fragile if you let your guard down for more than a few seconds kept me into it and focused.\n\nMuch of the humor is pretty low-brow.  I had a good few chuckles, but most of it was passable.  Story is... definitely a story.  Ended kind of suddenly as well, which caught me off guard.  Only real complaint I have is the fact you can't customize your very large and obstructive crosshair which made some more precise long range areas and even a few mid-range fights more of a hassle than it should have been.  Everything beyond that is nitpicks, like how I had to enable raw mouse input, the gun viewmodel occasionally blocking an enemy, and a few annoying sequences.","April 8","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's remnicent of hardboiled fiction but is incredibly sardonic and comedic in tone. The story is fantastic, framed as a fbi interrogation of a wannabe detective retelling the story of the son of a crimeboss, Tony Luciano. The story opens with him saying something like: 'Bring me the girl, or this deasert eagle is gonna say it louder!' as you go on to have a shootout with gangsters. The game controls really well and the on rails setpeices are fantastic, then juxtoposed against things like your hair falling down, blocking your vision. The only sin this game has is that it is fairly short, although there is a fair bit of replayability with challenges and scoring system. In short it has a good story, great homour, tight controls (well on mouse and keyboard. there is leaf control support, but i hear it is not particularly intuitive), brilliant gameplay, doesnt feel repetitive as there are 2 characters you switch between, and different weapons for each level. It feels like what a revival of the rail shooter genre should be, and to my knowledge, a rare genre to find a game for. A very enjoyable game that is appropriately priced for the experience.","April 18","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had not played a rail shooter in a long time and it was really nice and relaxing to play a level every now and then. The game looks really nice and have some varied levels with some fun encounters in them. The narration is actually pretty entertaining and really adds something to the game. One problem the game have though is that it is pretty short (took me around 4 hours to complete it) and that the story just ended abruptly in the middle of the whole thing without resolving anything. I was really shocked when the game just ended and i actually suspected that i had to unlock some secret level or something to get the ending level but i have found no mention of this anywhere.\n\nAnother issue that i have is that you have to redo the whole level if you fail. It just does not appeal to me to replay an entire level if i screw up against the boss and i am not looking for that kind of experience when playing a game like this. It only happened once to me at the last level but it annoyed me and it almost made me drop the game.\n\nBut overall i enjoyed Blue Estate and would recommend it to anyone interested in this kind of game.","April 26","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
