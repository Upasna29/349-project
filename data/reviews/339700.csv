The combat is repetitive and doesn't do anything to distance itself from far better experiences in Chivary, and is as cookie cutter as it comes. For something that's supposed to be “historically accurate” as the description says, it's only the weapons that stand out in terms of accuracy. Honestly, there's nothing really “fun” about this game, it's a hack n slash with problematic controls and obviously doesn't belong on the PC in its current state. Avoid.\n\n+:\n-Some of the art visuals are nice.\n-At least performance wise it's not bad.\n-There's a variety of weapons?\n\n-:\nCombat is boring. Literally, it's block once in a while, slash once in a while, and that's about it.\nObviously a PC port. Lacks volume sliders, rebindable keys. Doesn't even bother to bring up the right explanations in parts to show what you need to use to activate certain moves.\nEvery weapon feels relatively the same.\nThe lock on feature breaks for no good reason at times, which is a problem in breaking the flow of combat.\nAnimation quality at times is poor, which doesn't help in combat.\nAI is pretty basic.\nIt's NOT FUN. It's as simple at that.\n\nFor More First Impressions And Gameplay Footage: http://youtu.be/DZgIhKu6W1w","April 7, 2015","false","3.4"," 159 of 195 people (82%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","82","159","195","6","3"

You're goal is to win all the battles in the Arena and to become the ultimate gladiator while also achieving fame and being loved by the audience.\n\nGRAPHICSThe game does not look terrible for an iOS port, and there are some video options that don't make much difference. However, there are various clipping problems and a couple of items some items where unreachable because they spawned inside rocks.\n\nGAMEPLAYYou use the mouse buttons to hack and slash, Spacebar to block and F to kick your enemies into traps. Unfortunately, the response time is really slow and some enemies take ages to be killed.\nThere are four chapters, each with 20 levels. In each level, your goal is to kill all the opponents. There are side objectives that grant you with additional experience and gold, which will be respectively used to upgrade your character and to buy extra items.\nMultiplayer is not balanced at all, and you will find many people with better equipment and stats than yours that will kill you instantly.\n\nCHALLENGEThe game is not very challenging: you spend most of the time hitting enemies, running around to recover your stamina and than starting over. Multiplayer is not fun and the game is only fun in short sessions (20-30 minutes max.)\n\nSOUNDNothing exciting: typical "epic" music and sound effects that are pretty poor and repetitive. I do like that in the few cutscenes of the game, the characters speak actual latin.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThere are many Steam achievements and side objectives to complete that will keep you hooked for many hours.\n\nOverall, it is not a bad game for a mobile port. However, the unresponsive controls and the frustrating combat (both in single-player and multiplayer) really don't make this worth buying at full price.\n\nStory: 4\nGraphics: 6.5\nGameplay: 6\nChallenge: 7\nSound: 7\nReplayability: 8\n\nENJOYMENT: 5.5\nFRUSTRATION: 8\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","April 8, 2015","false","4.3"," 49 of 76 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","49","76","4","3"

The graphical style is very similar and are Gladiators that different looking to Bandits?\n\nThe game itself has received negative reviews as it is an iOS port. I got the game for a fiver as thought it looked fun and I wasn't disappointed. You play a gladiator thrust into various arenas with various fighters, traps, beasts and winning conditons. You can upgrade and buy equipment as you progress. I lost a few fights so it isn't a complete cake walk and there are various special conditions you can chase in each arena fight, so you will go back to them. The fighting looks and feels nice but I found the targetting system a bit unreliable. Mostly I would just block until I was engaged and then they would be auto targetted.\n\nThe multiplayer element seemed fairly pointless, but I got this for the single player and there are loads of arenas to fight through with bosses at the end of each chapter.

It has that Borderlands esk art style which really pleases the eye. The single player story mode is very well done too; you start out as a pretty much naked gladiator, and you work your way up the ranks earning coin to buy new weapons and armor, each fight gives you experience as well which you can then spend on different attributes. Some of the weapons here are absolutely brutal.\n\nSadly there is a few buggy issues such as sound cutting out at random points and the controls are somewhat laggy; sometimes the game doesn't even recognise you have pressed a button a couple of times, then suddenly you press it again and it works.\n\nIf you can look pass these issues which are only minor in the grand scheme of things, you have yourself a pretty good hack and slash gladiator game.\n","April 10, 2015","true","5.2"," 31 of 64 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","31","64","0","1"

You can try it on the App store or Google play at first. If you want to try it on PC, then give it a chance. If you think it is not a game for your PC, then just pass it.\n\nI like this game and it's music. It is simple and powerful. Kill enemies and your time.\n\nNow I love LB+RB, it is really cool : )","April 9, 2015","true","1.6"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","9","22","2","0"

I should have you all sentenced for theft of intellectual property especially some of the comments reaching onwards of how its a mobile when it clearly wasN't a game that was on mobile before hand and knowingly was also taken the same way mobile companies take games you also now partake in that trend. It wasn't even released so how the ♥♥♥ do you think that's okay to steal someone's property. So that is sad as ♥♥♥. And yes, I am surprised you found this game, you shouldnt have, And for all intents and purposes you fckn stole it. I rather sue the living fire out of you but that's not much a problem as getting you to admit the fact you are fraudulent at distributing original titles where credit is more or less unanswered for. ♥♥♥♥ you.

This game is based inside the roman arena where intense stand offs and bloody carnage took place. I, Gladiator successfully recreates the brutal and unforgiving world that was arena fighting, complete with chopping fighters hands, arms, legs and of course heads off! However this game isnt mindless violence with lack of depth to it, infact there is a VAST array of customisation that can take place! You can buy countless weapons, armour, shields from the local merchant. You can also upgrade your character with skill points upon leveling up as you progress through the game. The story behind this game is of the main character Rufus who was at the very pinnacle of the arena world, until the unforgiving world of the arena betrayed and forsaken him to the lair of Hades. I, Gladiator is a story of betrayal to triumph and revenge, with intuitive fighting controls that feel responsive and fluid, just as you would expect from a fast paced fighting game! We here at ZaccyboyGaming really enjoyed our brief time with this game, with its exciting combat and deadly executions, to its vast customisation options. Even the multiplayer fights are well implemented and enjoyable, with the opportunity to taunt your friends because you have destroyed them! i,Gladiator is currently on sale on steam for a very respectable and low price, so make sure you pick this game up! We at ZaccyboyGaming give I,Gladiator 8/10.\n\nStay tuned for more Reviews on some more great games :)","April 9, 2015","true","0.5"," 9 of 23 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","9","23","0","0"

However, this game does not shy from throwing some more blood at you.\nEach NPC opponent does have their own uniqueness with the help from differences in equipment, body sizes and gestures. The randomness provided by the arena and traps at different levels also helped to avoid you from getting the repetitive feelings.\nThe Latin voice acting is unique and with the vast amount of historical weapons and armors to choose from, really helps to set the stage for this game.\nHowever, one is easy to spot that there is a lack of details in this game. Despite the numerous equipment available and different arena settings, there is no description to the historical details of such equipment, nor would the game tell the player which part of the Roman Empire you are fighting in.\n\nGameplay\n\nPlacing yourself in the role of the most fearsome gladiator Rufus, brought back to life by Mercury, you are here to regain your past glory in the arena on behalf of your god.\nEach stage is divided into multiple enemy waves. However, the pre-set enemy aggro at the beginning of the fight does make it feels unrealistic when the NPC just ignores the player standing right in-front and rushes towards another guy 5 meters away.\n\nAlthough it is important to win the fight by defeating your fellow gladiators, you are also being handed a few objectives which will grant you bonus rewards and increase the difficulty for a perfect victory. However, the most important thing is to win the heart of the audiences. For they are willing to throw in bags of coins just to see some heads rolling actions.\nOne major problem of this game is the poorly written AI. It is so easy to lure your opponent to burn themselves by walking into naked flames or onto an obvious beast trap. There are a variety of game modes provided for multiplayer, including a real time quick match and a time record challenge. However, the quick match suffers greatly from unstable connection and lagging issue, which can make you feel frustrated.\n\nSummary\nIn summary, I, Gladiator is a fun simplistic game which is perfect for a short gaming break.\nHowever, I would rather buy the iPad version which costs 60% less than my current PC version.\n","April 8, 2015","false","2.3"," 21 of 49 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","21","49","0","0"

The pictures and videos they have on Steam do not do this game justice. The graphics have the cartoony/Borderlands feel that I enjoy, and there is actually a legitimate and interesting storyline to the game. The mechanics, however, could be improved. For instance, the blocking is undependable at times, the attacks are fairly slow or delayed, and the finishers, moves and enemies are repeats of each other. Other than that, this was a fun game to play that I will gladly return to!

It all feel much more fast paced than expected and some of the blow- you really really feel them.\nI was unprepared for some of the delay when moving to strike after having been on the defensive for a moment, but being more careful with timing isn't so hard to pick up.\nAll around, this is definitely worth the cheap price so far!\n\nAlso, I beheaded a man with a club. 10/10","April 7, 2015","true","0.4"," 38 of 194 people (20%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","20","38","194","9","0"
