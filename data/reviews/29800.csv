Despite the poor graphics, the game is kept interesting by the multitude of unique levels and environments and the actual gameplay is incredibly fun. The controls are also very smooth, however I wouldn't recommend using a gamepad because aiming and adjusting the camera angles was very annoying. The electronic soundtrack was also great and fit the game perfectly. I also really like how the combat actually shapes the environment. Creating giant craters and canyons while blasting at enemies is a real treat and sadly, is something we don't see too often in games. My only real complaint is that it's not very challenging and the game itself is very short. I also would have liked to see a more engaging story out of Caster. It's mostly just focused on the action without any real character development. Nevertheless, it's a pretty fun game. I think that it is slightly overpriced due to the relatively small amount of gameplay it contains, but It was definitely worth how much I payed for it thanks to my coupon (50% off). So I recommend checking it out if you can get your hands on one!","January 15, 2015","true","5.2"," 93 of 109 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","93","109","5","1"

It’s also a ton of fun, in large part because it’s only just barely holding it together and doesn’t really give a damn if anything makes sense as long as it’s entertaining.\n\nEverything about Caster is more than a little insane and nonsensical. It’s always trying new stuff just because it can, and though this means the whole game feels like a crash course in engine experimentation, somehow it works. It really has no business being as fun as it is, but something about running around as an immensely overpowered MegaMan-reject is so stupid I was barely able to keep it together while playing the game.\n\nI have no doubt Caster would be a huge chore if it insisted on imposing any restrictions on you or ever became an actual challenge (though a few moments in the second half begin to weigh the game down), but for the most part it lets you do whatever you want. It doesn’t matter if it unbalances the game or even breaks it in places, you’ve been put into this sandbox to blow stuff up and run really fast and that’s about all I needed.\n\nCaster might be barely competent but I can’t help but admire how little it cares or tries to pretend it’s anything but a bit of super dumb fun. I can’t stress enough how stupid everything here is and how delightful I found it. So, sure, I could tear it apart as an ugly piece of garbage, but apparently I was in the mood for something so-bad-it’s-good and Caster more than fit the bill.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","April 9, 2015","true","2.0"," 51 of 61 people (84%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","84","51","61","11","1"

Playing around with the terrain, running at super-speed up vertical cliffs while machine-gunning energy bolts at mite-like things chasing you, dodging projectiles and then capping it off with a super-high jump that lands you hard enough to deform the ground?  That's a sort of rush that doesn't really appear in a lot of titles, let alone one with system requirements as relaxed as this.  The weapons are pretty unbalanced and you'll only be using one or two once you get them, but that's not really a problem given that competitive balance is a non-issue here.\n\nI only wish they'd given you more opportunities and incentive to use the terrain deformation powers to your advantage, in ways that would make you feel that same exhiliration.  It does lack variety and interesting strategy, which is sad.  Community support and quality custom levels and stuff would make this so much more worthwhile, given the core gameplay conceit, but even as it is, it's got a charm to it.  When it's bad, it's dull.  When it's good, it's that kind of game that's fun for the first few days, then you forget about it for a while, and then you pick it up again and relive the magic that hooked you the first time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/g74jklsgk/recommended/29800/","g74jklsgk","Null Scarab","http://steamcommunity.com/id/g74jklsgk/","163 products in account","Caster is an average third person shooter that does not contain any notable qualities, aside from the ability to destroy terrain and perform ridiculous map-crossing leaps.\n\nYour objective in each level is to either kill every enemy or do a generic fetch quest (there are a few other missions with different objectives but they're uninteresting, for example; shoot a tree). Every level is incredibly short, and even on my first time, each one averaged no longer than a minute. Speaking of game length, the entire thing isn't longer than an hour. The game abruptly ends with a "To Be Continued...", and despite being released in 2009, there has been no continuation, and it seems the website does not hint at anything of the sort either.\n\nEnemies are all very generic, and each one of their attacks can be easily avoided by just sprinting around or jumping. Even if they do manage to hit you, they deal hardly any damage, and they are easily dispatched; even more so with the weapon upgrades.\n\nThe story is uninspired, and unless you've never heard or seen the "It's humans against aliens, you're our only hope!" plot, then I doubt you'll be interested. As I stated earlier, the game ends at a very unexpected random point with sequel bait.\n\nA map editor is available, but I did not use it or download custom maps, so I cannot comment on that.\n\nI did not find Caster to be particularly interesting in any way. Terrain destruction and super speed can be fun and worth it if you paid 0.14 cents, but beyond that, there's not much else that the game offers.","March 25, 2015","false","1.1"," 30 of 37 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","30","37","0","0"

If I'd know it would have been this good I would have happily paid $5. This game is a fantastic indie gem. It really gives me hope that not ALL the indie games on Steam are awful trash.\n\nPROS:\n+ Terrain deformation is fun and quick but doesn't feel gimmicky or normally required. It frees you up to play with things as you like.\n+ Running and jumping is smooth and handles well.\n+ The few enemies the game has are varied and interesting and also deform the terrain.\n+ Finding the hidden collectables isn't compulsory (it would be very annoying if it was) but makes for a fun extra goal to lengthen the game a little.\n+ The game doesn't stretch itself longer than it should be. There's not enough content here for 10 hours of gameplay so they didn't make that much.\n\nCONS:\n- The game is short, very short. There's probably more that could be done by adding a few more enemies and a few more levels.\n- Little problems with all the weapons. Not game ruining, just minor gripes:\n> The blaster's crosshairs don't line up perfectly with its ostensibly straight shots. This only becomes apparent at extreme range.\n> The eruptor is very hard to aim as it doesn't have a light effect or cast a shadow and just appears as a distortion on the screen. It's very hard to tell where one is in 3D space (how close/far). This also makes enemies that shoot it odd to fight.\n> The homing shot has a very hard time hitting enemies. It flies around in circles and ends up slamming into terrain about 75% of the time.\n> The shield attack is a neat idea but doesn't have an applicable purpose.\n- Very few enemies in the game, both in type and actual number. The game would benefit from a little more crowded levels. Some very large levels only have like 6 enemies in them.\n\nFinal Verdict: Buy this game.\n\nIf you see it on sale BUY THIS GAME.","March 23, 2015","true","1.7"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","34","46","0","1"

This makes terraforming a great part of the game.\n\nHowever, it would be wrong in this case, half of the weapons are pure ♥♥♥♥ in terms of usability.

I've, for example, never used the Stun weapon and just blasted and destroyed so much land, that I bet I would get Greenpeace or such at my back.\n\nThe campaign is also really short unless you really want a perfect score but what would that even be?\nYou could be finished with the first campaign in about 30 minutes to an hour. There are 2 campaigns and possible even user-made content.\nAdditionally, half the levels are pretty repetitive.\n\nDoes this all makes the game bad?

Basically, this is a mission based game. You select levels and get missions upon entering them. Missions are generally things like, collect all the orbs or kill all the enemies. Although there are more complicated missions, especially later. As you go through the first set of levels, you'll learn the basics, get new weapons, and collect in=game currency. You use the in-game currency to buy upgrades between levels, such as boosting your natural abilities and powering up the weapons you have collected. You can walk around, jump, and shoot for basic controls. However, you can also hit jump again and hold the button to do a super jump, which can help for dodging enemies and clearing distances and obstacles. The other special ability is a dash, which allows you to run quickly. This can help run up slopes and across water. Combining these two special abilities can make for some great techniques. There's also an interesting mechanic of being able to destroy and build up the land with your weapons. This can make tough situations easier depending on what you choose to upgrade and when. There are three sets of levels. The first set are there to help you learn the basics. The second set will make you use your abilities in more interesting ways. The third set will challenge your skills. It's a simple design that has lots of potential. The art is very colorful and pretty, even if I had to run it in minimum settings for my old worn out computer. It still looks really nice, and the music is alright too. It also has a low level of story investment.\n\nWhat I mean by that is... there's only vague story connections from mission to mission, and they don't have much to do with an overall plot. Also, not everyone will be thrilled with the graphical style, as it is dated in terms of modern games. Plus, the level selection method may turn away mordern minded gamers, as well as the simplistic gameplay. The third set of levels are made by the community and aside from the fact that they are very difficult, they're just a bit of a hassle to get. They aren't included with the game download, nor are they available through Steam workshop. To get the third set of levels, you need to go to their site, download the levels, and place them into the correct folder. It's not complicated, but it's a hassle that I'm guessing most won't bother to do, even though it's worth it for more levels. And you'll want more levels because the second set of levels, designed by the developer, is unfinished. There's one mission that, when selected, simply says to be continued. This game, according to the Steam store page, came out in 2009... and it's still not finished. This leads me to believe it's not going to be finished, or if it IS then it's going to have to wait until the developer isn't busy with other projects, which is a shame because this game has lots of potential and I'd sure like to see it through to the actual end to see know what it has been building up to.\n\nStill, Caster is tons of fun if you're into platforming third person shooters. It's kind of like a 3D Mega Man if they had done the Mega Man Legends games differently I guess. It has simple rules that create so much potential for cool and interesting levels and missions. While it's not complete yet, it's still worth the 3 dollar asking price. I got it on sale thinking I'd hate it, but it's actually a lot of fun. You could wait for a sale, but it's worth the money anyway. Just make sure you get those extra levels for some more fun. Caster gets a 7/10 for being a very fun third person platformer shooter similar to those a few generations ago.","April 11, 2015","true","5.4"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","15","16","2","0"

This is what I have to say:\n\n~====~\nGraphics\n~====~\nThis game is good for what you are into when it comes to gaming though the graphics aren't the best which is fine, but sometimes if someone would want to have the best graphics on because they are used to it or they just want full graphics then this won't be the best for you. The characters are a bit blocky which is also fine, but in "This day in age" we aren't used to seeing super blocky characters unless the whole game is made like that. For example, Minecraft is made to be a blocky game so that you can enjoy the building aspect in it to it's fullest extent, though when you play this game you would assume it to be a bit more adjusted to the kind of graphics we see today. The animations are pretty good and the game has a lot of potential in this category but for now I give it this:\n~Not the Best but hopefully be improved upon~\n\n~====~\nCombat\n~====~\nThere isn't much to talk about in regards to combat in this game but, the combat in this game could be a bit better and also a bit less repetitive in it's own way. Basically, you spawn into the mission, you're given an objective to do then you do the objective and the mission is done. The objectives aren't all too complicated but they do get repetitive after a while of playing, I know I have only played for 35 minutes or so but that's because I don't feel like going through the same stuff constantly. So I would give the combat this:\n~It gets Repetitive after a while~\n\n~====~\nStory\n~====~\nI am not gonna lie but I didn't pay attention to the story all that much, I started the game and I was given a black screen with text explaining the story. After about a minute or so I realized I had to click the mouse to continue the text scrolling so I kept reading a few more messages. After I read a bit more, I figured that this would just show me millions of text boxes to read so I just skipped through them so I could actually play the game. So, I would give the story this:\n~Possibly Good if you take the time to read~\n\n~====~\nFinal Verdict\n~====~\nThis game isn't really worth to buy unless you get it on a great sale like I did or you really like these kinds of games. I would check out videos by players about it to get a better feel for the game before you buy it.","March 25, 2015","false","0.8"," 27 of 42 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","27","42","0","0"

You go from level to level, which for most of it is a choice as to which level you take on.  Each level has different objectives, there are about 3-4 different styles each with the occasional story sequence thrown in.  There are plenty of weapons to choose from, my favorite is the seeker, you probably should upgrade that first among the other weapons.\n\nPerformance wise I haven't ran into any issues, this game despite being made in 2010 knows I have a 144hz monitor and caps at 144 fps.  Major credit for that.  You would think this game would be great for a controller, but on default settings the camera control on the right stick is all messed up, best to just stick with the keyboard and mouse for this one.\n\nIn conclusion, for 14 cents it's a no brainer, buy this game.  It's regular price is $3.00 I really don't think that is asking for too much for this game either.  Plus this game supports modding so it's worth it just for that.  I should also mention that the soundtrack is pretty awesome too and is worth the money alone.\n\nFor the low price, and for what it is, with the inclusion of mod support, I give this game a 4 out of 5.","March 25, 2015","true","3.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

But I still cant understand it. Good PS1 games made 15-20 years ago had much better composed graph and animations, more interesting gameplay, worlds, overall design. In the late '90s this game would be mediocre at best. Two decades later its simply bad.\nGood games remain good games even after decades.

And when you select them you change color like megaman... added bonus. Most weapons are useful, i thought the seeker and the yellow guns could use some fine tuning. but the fact that there are 2 weapons that raise and lower the terrain is very cool.\n\nThe levels: small, very rough around the edges, looks like one of my first farcry maps. But at the same time the basic design of each level is pretty in its own way. It is easy to get where you want to, whether it be running up a giant vertical wall or jumping 500 feet over it.\n\nGame Mechanics / physics: Superfast, it is a reflex based game when it comes down to it. Again REALLY cool to jump super high like matrix / Hulk and land with a shockwave. Once you get the dash and jump leveled up it becomes a bit more fun. Most of the weapons fire satisfactorily.\n\nMusic and SFX: Good Electronic soundtrack to go along with the fast-paced gameplay, pretty much house music. Sound effects are also good.\n\nPeople have compared it to Sonic and Megaman. I agree, I would also give it a comparison to flower because of the healing trees with your gun fire thing going on not to mention the short levels.\n\nGame is not finished... you feel like you are 75% done and it just ends abruptly. Hope they finish it! Maybe add some moves to it, you end up flying through the air a lot at the end of the game with no way to land if you jump to far besides holding the opposite direction which slows you in mid air. Maybe a mario ground pound or dive bomb to give you a swift landing. Could use some more interaction with the environment, vines to swing on, wall jumps, something else to do besides shoot and jump all the time.\n\n","May 26, 2015","true","4.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

This game has it covered.\n\nBut let's review the description of the game.\n\n- "Massive terrain deformation!" - Making the terrain go up or down is not massive.\n\n- "Use strategy to destroy hordes of bugs with a variety of unique behaviors and attacks" - Not really. Just get and upgrade missiles and stun and everything becomes a joke.\n\n- "Bring trees back to life and collect energy to purchase upgrades" - Bring trees back to life? How's that a feature.\n\n- "Upgrade your skills to run on water and jump hundreds of feet into the air" - Pretty much the fun part of the game, which is the movement since some maps are pretty big. Running on walls could have better controls.\n\n- "Pulse pounding music by Trance Emerson" - Music is pretty nice but nothing to brag about. How you like your music is your own taste and opinion.\n\n- "3 levels of play (Casual, Normal, and Extreme)" - Even on extreme its easy if you upgraded your sprint. If nothing can touch you whats going to kill you? If you guessed lava, acid and sorts. You're right. Enemies suck.\n\n- "2 playable characters" - It's pretty much the same character but with a different gender. They both have the same abilities and whatnot so there's nothing different from one another. It's pretty much if Mass Effect said theres 2 characters but one is male Shepard and female Shepard.\n\n- "6 unique attacks" - I wouldn't say unique. 3 attacks are lasers which 1 goes foward, the other you can cast multiple and the last its a homing laser. 2 change the terrain and the last one stuns enemies.\n\nIt's not amazing and the graphics are meh. Don't get me started with the player models and the enemies. Jesus how did that go so wrong. (The fact that the concept art was pretty cool and interesting).\nCrosshair is a lying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\nThe camera controls, I really don't know what to say about it. It's just wrong.\n\nApart from messed up lazy models, the messy controls and camera. On and all, I had fun. I think it's a game where you can easily spend 2 hours on it without feeling bored or stressed out.\n\nGet it on sale thou.\n\n","March 28, 2015","true","2.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Yura","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MisterYura/","328 products in account","The premise is clear: the Flanx have invaded Middon, which is short of experienced mages, and you, a noob Caster, gets the job of owning the bad guys.\n\nRight away, you’re put in this action shooter game that has a remind of a 3D Megaman. You’ll be dashing, double jumping and collecting  several diferent weapons that will by fired by your arm and many of which can be charged before firing. Among the arsenal you will find from energy blasts and bombs to seeker missiles and a stunner, including some kind of gravitational gun that will deform the terrain increasing its height. If it was not enough, you can actually deform and destroy all the terrain by all your attacks, which also spices the combat mechanics.\n\nYou will face from cockroaches and flying beetles to giant worms. Each enemy is very different in all aspects starting by the models, and including their weapon and combat approach. You should even be prepared for enemies lurking out from the ground and find yourself running while saying ugly words. What is a bit strange is that, having put the time in differentiating the enemies so much, most, if not all, of them just use the same weapons available to you just colored differently.\n\nThe game packs 15 short levels and the progress is quite fast. You will start with just an energy gun and the ability to do some small double jumps and dashes and a small health bar. However, in each level you will collect energy by killing Flanx and healing trees, which then you will be able to spend upgrading yourself. There are also some weapons that you will have to find -not that it is hard- to unlock them, and your character will even change color when changing weapon -what does that remind you of, again?-.\n\nCaster can be completed in a couple hours, maybe a little longer, although you won’t be able to upgrade everything -and I mean everything, your jumps height, dash duration, health level, weapons power…-, which may take an extra hour replaying some levels. However, if you really want to play more, you can find mods in the game’s website that will give you some extra content. And you will probably want to play some more, since it’s one of those games where you’re just telling yourself after each level ‘Only one more level and then I walk the dog’ and more soon than later there is no one more level.\n\nAbout the soundtrack, I should mention it’s not constant. It packs some tracks that you won’t notice to be there and some others that will really pick your attention because they’re actually good.\n\nOverall, Caster is one of these very beautiful indie games that also packs good controls and gameplay and will leave you a taste of wanting more.","August 9, 2013","true","2.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","9","11","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cakes1/recommended/29800/","cakes1","ʕგҚვֆ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cakes1/","1174 products in account","While Caster can be fun some of the time, there's really no other value there. If all you want to do is spam overpowered weapons while sprinting around at mach speed, this is probably the game for you. But if you like your games with actual value in them, actual story, playability, difficulty, challenge or what have you, then look elsewhere, because Caster lacks all of those and then some.\n\nThe graphics are very outdated and the textures/models can be glitchy as they clip a good amount, but even if they don't they're still not pleasant to look at. The character isn't even aesthetically pleasing and that's the one thing you have to stare at the entire game. Not to mention his/her face is just down-right creepy at some angles. The balancing is dreadful, as you get a game-breaking weapon at about level two, and the difficulty spikes up and down more than a heart monitor. Also, once you max out your health and sprint ability (which can be done very early game, mind you), you can just sprint back and forth to avoid every projectile, while spamming you're broken weapon that shoots as fast as you can click (and if you're like me, that means it can be spammed at speeds that will melt bosses in no time).\n\nSo there's no balancing and the graphics are bad, what else? Well, the story is worse than both of those cons combined. The easiest way to describe the story is by saying that there just isn't one. You're a new recruit and you're sent on missions to combat what seems to be an evil creature-empire that's expanding and trying to take over the world(?). You go place to place and just clear each level, there's no more objectives than that. Also, there's only like two themes of levels, and they're repeated over and over.\n\nLater game you run into a few levels that are almost impossible given the game's engine, where you have to keep a small ship out of the water even though it goes way faster than you can terraform the ground in front of it, and a boss battle that just drags on so long no matter how much damage you deal per second, and you just have to spam and dodge for like five minutes straight. The game is also very short.\n\nAnd last but not least, the developer decided to incorporate a destructible environment... everywhere. Weapons that deal a little bit of area damage will also chip away at the ground on every level, so if you max out your weapon and you're spamming like hell (as is the custom) the ground will basically meltdown out from under where you're aiming. It breaks the map and it breaks the game, even though it was already broken from all the other previously mentioned problems.\n\nWhen it's all said and done, I would not recommend the Caster to- well, anybody. The only reason it's not getting a 1/10 is because sprinting back and forth at mach speed while spamming your blaster like you have some sort of turrets is actually quite enjoyable in a weird way. So because I ran into a little bit of fun there, I give Caster a generous 3/10. That being said, do not buy this no matter what, not only because you'll waste money, but mostly because you'll just waste your time. I got it on sale for pocket change and I feel like I still got ripped off.\n\n3.4/10","December 24, 2015","false","1.1"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","14","24","0","0"

Poor visual quality with short fog distance, basically looks like something you'd find on a demo disc for your PS1.  Very basic gameplay, pick up orbs and destroy enemies. The worst gamepad control layout I've ever seen.  (Left and right on your right thumb stick to look up and down, oh and it also fires your weapon, SERIOUSLY?).  Pretty short game, 22 missions, many of them only take a couple minutes to finish.\n\nWhat's good:\nAnd yet, its strangely entertaining to play.  There's a good sense of speed when you sprint and super jump around the maps, and the terrain manipulation, while often not needed, is a cool gimmick.  It also controls great with mouse and keys for a third person game.\n\nWorth getting?\nEven if its a bit short you can still get some hours of reasonably entertaining action here.  So yes, there's far worse things you can do with your €3 than getting this game.  I've also seen the game discounted so deep, that putting the trading cards from it on the market basically pays for the game as well.","June 4, 2015","true","1.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The integrity displayed overwhelmed me with three main points; the divinely hand crafted atmosphere most games lack, the unassailible and limitless ways to share your victories with others, and the enticing graphics to draw you straight into the action.\n\nWithout doubt, the setting portrayed throughout the stages perfectly inveigled me into the story like no other have I experienced. The peachy skies and flawless earls encrusting the curiosity held in deep under the covers. I would suggest one to visit the profile of yours truly, to absorb the scenery in the screenshot photography I specialise in.\n\nMany a time, I would be left alone in other games, a lonely tension in the air. Fear not, for caster consumatley fulfills this hunger for companionship one so desires. To quote Nicholas Sparks:  “She was struck by the simple truth that sometimes the most ordinary things could be made extraordinary, simply by doing them with the right people...”  I would highly encourage this lively experience for anyone sociable or not.\n\nIn most cases with mainstream games, one would be marketed to a particular audience, focusing on one factor such as story, gameplay, or graphics, etc. Caster? nop. Caster is a game that is truly extraordinarily well blended, like a single malt Glenmorangie fitted in a round bottomed dummy, dohdoh, or binky (Pacifier for the uneducated).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noexecute17/recommended/29800/","noexecute17","Aunt Claret","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noexecute17/","101 products in account","Let's say something honest about this game.\n\nThis game makes me sad. Not because it is mediocre (just mediocre though, not utterly shameful), but because it tries and fails.\n\nCaster has a few features which got me entertained for some time despite the poor overall quality of the game. The character movements are well-done and it's pleasant to jump n' run around with actually quite much fluidity. The entire terrain deformation feature also made me have a bunch of fun at it's well-included in the level design (I'd even say this is pretty much the only thing that keeps the lev-des acceptable along with the variety of the environnements).\n\nBUT.\n\nThe first thing which will strike you is the graphics. Jesus. I know it's Elecorn's first game, but the game came out in 2009 and I felt like I was playing an early PS2 game. The textures are low-res (giving by the way to your character the face of an eternal suffering) and the models are quite polygonal.\n\nWhile I'm at it with the general graphics, the particle and pyrotechnic effects are horrendous. When you cast an attack, you really don't have a feel of empowerment because they just look so weak and unimpressive. Some fire and explosions would be welcome in order to take these pew-pews to the next level. Even the attacks from your ennemies are looking unthreatening, while they in fact at medium defficulty deal a good bunch of punch. This seems like a detail, but that will make the boredom come at you in an even shorter time.\n\nNow 'bout the the gameplay. Like I said, there are a few interesting things which brings some spice to your adventure. But the gameplay is seriously too repetitive. There are tens of levels and the objective is always the same. Either kill all the ennemies, pick up some energy balls or make a dead tree come back to life. And it's a shame, because this game has potential. There could've been much more things to do, especially with the pleasant movement system and the different attacks to gather along the game.\n\nOh, yes, the attacks. There's a total of six attacks which are, like I said, pretty unimpressive, but fun to use for a little time. You have a basic pulse laser attack, a charged blast attack which deals great damage to both the ennemies and the environnement, an ability to raise the level of the ground, seeking missiles, stunning lasers and a (quite useless) shield.\n\nNot only they look pitiful, but their upgrade system is too classical and bulky, and you just gather these attacks by approaching spheres which are spread in the in-game world. You don't acquire them by defeating bosses or gathering an out-of-the-ordinary object, nah. You just encounter 'dem spheres and yoohoo, magical attack learning. That is and will remain too simplistic and it totally does not give any feeling of accomplishment.\n\nI could bash this game for a longer time, but this is just sad to look at. There's been effort and you can feel it. And I don't want to be too harsh on somthing that's been the output of many hours of work. So I just hope Elecorn will learn from its failures of the past and make us a neat Caster 2 in the future. Because they really seem to have good ideas, and good ideas leads to potential.\n\nC'mon. You can do it, guys.","April 25, 2015","false","1.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This is more like a prototype, a "test" from the developers and it does have some interesting mechanics. Music was great, loved it. Graphics not so much, it is too much "meh", they look like some sort of graphic that a ps1 game would have, which not necesseraly makes it bad, but there is simply nothing unique about it, it doesn't catch your attention, it has absolutly no proper style.\n\nAnd the gameplay, oh the gameplay, so much mixed feelings about it... First of all, it is quite fun to search for all the weapons, but after you got all of them (about halfway through) it absolutely doesn't make you want to continue. As you upgrade your gear you start becoming OP, very early in game i maxed my normal gun and a few moments later my dash and my jump, it wasn't very hard to do this and yet, i became a monster. Max Dash+Max jump = saints row 4 flying mechanic. Max laser gun = Continuos beam of death. What irritates the most is that the developers though they could fix this by making the enemies even more OP. Bosses are bullet sponge, flying mosquitos are almost impossible to kill and do WAY too much damage. Plus, minus 1 point for that freaking Toxic cloud.\n\nAfter all, it was a short game, a interesting concept, a very nice music and that's about it. Worth 2 dollars? I don't think so, you probably will just keep in your steam library and never play.\n\nWant to buy this game on sale so you can sell the cards and "win" money? Good luck, i have beaten both campaings and won a single card.\n","June 17, 2015","false","3.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

Frankly, I only got it because there was a ridiculous sale that dropped the price down to 14 cents. Upon playing it, I was pleasantly surprised. The gameplay is simple but very fun. It's a third person run and gun action game that puts you in arenas of varying sizes, each with a simple task to complete. There isn't a lot of variety in these tasks, it's either collect orbs, destroy monsters or a boss, or shoot a tree... it makes sense in context. The game isn't very challenging or long, I beat all the currently available missions within three hours and a good chunk of that time was just faffing about running and jumping for fun. The mobility in this game is what makes it so fun. Running and high jumping all over the map kept me amused and entertained throughout the whole game. There's also an arsenal of weapons that range from rapid fire homing bolts to terrain morphing blasts that make the gameplay more unique. The art and design style leaves a lot to be desired. Everything is blocky and unpolished. It looks like an early PS1 game in alpha. Still, it doesn't really affect gameplay so it's not a big deal. There hasn't been many updates to this game even though it's pretty old so don't expect new content. There are community mods, however, so you're not limited to the main game. Even then, this game is reasonably priced so you're not getting ripped off if there aren't any more updates. I'd say, give it a try. It's far from perfect but for what it is, it's fun. Plus, it'll kill a couple hours if you're bored.","April 6, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Once I opened the game it just looked like another generic ♥♥♥♥♥♥ low-priced videogame that people buy because profit, but just for good measure I started playing it. I was shocked because of all the options it has, quite impressed to be honest that in a game like this you can change the depth of field, resolution, shadows and so on and so forth.\nThe gameplay is actually pretty well designed, the combat is a little bit repetitive not going to lie but you do have a quite variety of weapons to chose from if you so desire, even though the balance in this game is ABSOLUTELY disgusting. You can kill the final boss of the first campaign just by freezing the damn thing and shooting it with your basic attack. The dash ability is ridiculously Overpowered as well as the super jump which at this rate might as well be called flying because that's exactly what you end up doing, flying through half of the map, stay on the ground for a few seconds and then take off to get to the other side of the map.\nAnother thing that bothers me is the fact that the game doesn't actually encourage you to complete all of the stages without taking any damage other than the 2,000 bonus credits you get that are incredibly useless once you are fully upgraded (at last in the part of the game I stopped playing). Guns are too powerful, enemies are the same and predictable and the game is way too easy, I literally just finished the first campaign using two weapons and the others just to pick up the Energy Orbs when needed. Nice game it is worth the price just needs more attention on the balance side of things.","April 2, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You're able to run super fast, and also jump very, VERY high, which makes the game quite interesting. You get throughout the game 6 different powers (different attacks) which you'll be able to use in the later maps. These 2 combined together makes a quite nice punch, as you'll be able to jump quite high and run fast to dodge the enemy attacks and at the same time shoot the enemies (this made the game quite easy for me tho). This reminded me very much of Megaman -series, since the character also looked alot like Megaman.\n\nThe game took about 1,5 hours for me to play through.","March 28, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am disappoint :c\nSome things, like the toxic clouds in some levels, kill you too quickly.\nThe enemies are too weak in terms of damage, are mostly microscopic and incredibly high in defence.\nThere was no character development. Like seriously, the only thing that speaks to you is this woman called Asha that does nothing to help you. And there's this "Commander's Log" which is just filler.\n\nOverall, I did find the game to be fun, but the cons were what changed my mind of the game a tiny bit.\n\n8/10\nA Sonikku seal of approval","March 27, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The preview video and the screenshots revealed little about its gameplay, and the art style didn't look like much, either.  But boy was I pleasantly surprised!\n\nThe spells you cast are really fun to use and each have their place against certain enemies, the movement is so satisfying and fun (dashing at the speed of sound and leaping across the entire map, anyone?) and the enemies, at this stage in the game, are easy but varied.\n\nMy only gripe is that the game hands you too many upgrade points at once.  I'm not even an hour in and I've already maxed three abilities (jump, dash and Pulse) and it's making the maps trivial at best.  Maybe this was the intention?\n\nAll in all, a great purchase (on sale for $0.14 USD) and I also think it's a good purchase at its full price as well.  Definitely worth your time.

Frankly, I only got it because there was a ridiculous sale that dropped the price down to 14 cents. Upon playing it, I was pleasantly surprised. The gameplay is simple but very fun. It's a third person run and gun action game that puts you in arenas of varying sizes, each with a simple task to complete. There isn't a lot of variety in these tasks, it's either collect orbs, destroy monsters or a boss, or shoot a tree... it makes sense in context. The game isn't very challenging or long, I beat all the currently available missions within three hours and a good chunk of that time was just faffing about running and jumping for fun. The mobility in this game is what makes it so fun. Running and high jumping all over the map kept me amused and entertained throughout the whole game. There's also an arsenal of weapons that range from rapid fire homing bolts to terrain morphing blasts that make the gameplay more unique. The art and design style leaves a lot to be desired. Everything is blocky and unpolished. It looks like an early PS1 game in alpha. Still, it doesn't really affect gameplay so it's not a big deal. There hasn't been many updates to this game even though it's pretty old so don't expect new content. There are community mods, however, so you're not limited to the main game. Even then, this game is reasonably priced so you're not getting ripped off if there aren't any more updates. I'd say, give it a try. It's far from perfect but for what it is, it's fun. Plus, it'll kill a couple hours if you're bored.","April 6, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Caster is a well-designed game with very tight controls and unique enemies that can change the way you play levels for a very fun experience. The story isn't the most well put-together and neither is the main character, but it serves well enough to get the game rolling. I think the levels are built very uniquely and not only cater to Caster's abilities and need for space when fighting enemies but also show how large and empty the world that Caster lives in. And while the Middon levels were fun, I think the ones in Lydonia were the more superiorly designed levels, though I hope the creator ends up making that last level, because that was a bit of a harsh slap to the face after having played so many engaging levels. This is definitely a game I recommend you don't pass up.","June 12, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While i may have purchased this game for 20 cents it is worth the 3 dollars that the developer is asking for. The reasoning is rather simple.\n\nThe game consists of approx 40 levels with some that can be added in with mods and while not complex provide enough entertainment and replay value while giving a summary of what was missed in the level collectables such as Orbs and enemies. And what is also nice is the levels are short allowing for quick sessions if desired.\n\nThe gameplay stands above everything in this game including the Presentation and Story. Including Fast gameplay, varied enemies and a choice of 6 different weapons. While the graphics leave something to be desired looking like a game from the N64 era the fast movement, insane jump height , and ability to scale walls add a nice touch to this 3rd person shooter that outweigh the graphics or lack of story in this game. Not to mention that the game has upgrades that can be applied to every ability.\n\nThe last thing i would add is if you do end up playing it or want the game to look more appealing, turn on cartoon shading in the .ini file of the game.","June 17, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Caster is a well-designed game with very tight controls and unique enemies that can change the way you play levels for a very fun experience. The story isn't the most well put-together and neither is the main character, but it serves well enough to get the game rolling. I think the levels are built very uniquely and not only cater to Caster's abilities and need for space when fighting enemies but also show how large and empty the world that Caster lives in. And while the Middon levels were fun, I think the ones in Lydonia were the more superiorly designed levels, though I hope the creator ends up making that last level, because that was a bit of a harsh slap to the face after having played so many engaging levels. This is definitely a game I recommend you don't pass up.","June 12, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While i may have purchased this game for 20 cents it is worth the 3 dollars that the developer is asking for. The reasoning is rather simple.\n\nThe game consists of approx 40 levels with some that can be added in with mods and while not complex provide enough entertainment and replay value while giving a summary of what was missed in the level collectables such as Orbs and enemies. And what is also nice is the levels are short allowing for quick sessions if desired.\n\nThe gameplay stands above everything in this game including the Presentation and Story. Including Fast gameplay, varied enemies and a choice of 6 different weapons. While the graphics leave something to be desired looking like a game from the N64 era the fast movement, insane jump height , and ability to scale walls add a nice touch to this 3rd person shooter that outweigh the graphics or lack of story in this game. Not to mention that the game has upgrades that can be applied to every ability.\n\nThe last thing i would add is if you do end up playing it or want the game to look more appealing, turn on cartoon shading in the .ini file of the game.","June 17, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not sure about later in the game though. The tutorial and the pop-up texts explain almost everything you need to know. It's a bit dark in parts of the game, and hit detection on a few of the enemies are off, but aside from that and me getting lost in some of the bigger maps, I have no complaints.

There are different powers to try out and they're all fun, the game is challenging and makes you use all of your skills. I enjoyed it because there was no right way to beat an enemy.

I expected absolutely nothing and got a bit more than that. All in all, it's a pretty good game... It's strikingly evocative of a sort of slightly-crappy but still "Cult classic" PS1 game, from the visuals to the early-2000s-esque techno music in the background- Which might turn some off, but honestly, it's exactly the sort of game I feel I would have rented at the video store growing up.\n\nThe gameplay's fairly simple and straightforward: Run around at high speed, shoot at enemies, rinse and repeat. The first weapon you get shoots rather slow-moving lasers- Brings back memories of the golden days of fast movement speed tied with non-hitscan weaponry, at least for me. As you progress through the levels, you pick up more abilities for your suit, as well as upgrade the abilities you already have, eventually ending up basically flying around the map at the speed of sound spamming homing missiles that kill everything on the screen pretty much automatically. The game has one of those really early terrain deformation systems, where you can raise or lower points on the map to your heart's content (After acquiring the weapons that let you do so, of course), which is cool I guess? It kept me engaged for the two and a half hours the main story lasted.\n\nOnto the story: To put it mildly, there isn't one. Really, there's three characters: You, a mute anime-ish-looking boy/girl in a suit of what can only be described as power armor; a two-dimensional portrait of a lady that gives you instructions at the start of each level and congratulates you at the end of such; and the commander, who you never even see and who only shows up through text at the beginning and end of the main story. The story itself is that there are a bunch of bug-things and you have to shoot them. It's really not that deep. It also happens to stop halfway through and suggest that you should wait until some sort of update.\n\nThe graphics are like a Nintendo 64 game, and not a good one. Enough said.\n\nAll in all, it's not what I'd call a great game, but if it's on sale, go ahead and pick it up. Put it this way: It's cheaper and much more fun than going to Wal-mart and getting a gumball from one of the machines.","July 28, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not like the new game trailers that doesn't have anything to do with the gameplay, this Steam trailer fits the whole gameplay pretty well. People who like fast and different movement in gaming like me, this is absolutely a good choice for it.\n\nPros:\n- Soundtrack. It's not like in trailer, it's peaceful with little power in it, so heck it's awesome and enertaining.\n- The speed. As I said about the different and fast movement, it's true.\n- Destroyable enviroment -  The weapons destroy (or add) some ground and you can use it to example avoid attacks.\n\nCons:\n- Length\n- Bonus maps by mods. Mod pack 1 took like 20 mins to complete, there's no much fanbase to this game and therefore no more maps, doesn't affect so much to the interest of this game.\n- Unbalanced weapons. Seriously I used almost only one weapon to complete the game because it was simply the best when upgrading to best\n- Super jump is too.. superior. You can kinda just fly through the map and kill the enemies above. It's not what Caster is about as you can see from the trailer. ---> I like the upgrades and stuff, but it makes stuff way too easy. If this game would be longer though, this issue could be removed, because you can't get half of the upgrades at the first levels.\n- Ignore the partial controller support - at least when my Gamecube controller was attached to my computer, it somehow bugged that it forced the mouse to go upwards 24/7","May 28","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To give you an idea, I beat this game in 89 minutes, that's with exploring, and completing EVERY little objective this game has. As soon as I beat it I never touched it again. Here are some pros and cons...\nPros:\n-The game is fun, and gives you a break from hardcore games.\n-I've never really seen any other game like it, it's fresh.\n-Easy to pick up, easy to play.\n-Fun abilities, and once yo finish the level you don't have to leave. There was a couple of times where I kinda dicked around a lot, but it was fun.\nCons:\n-The levels/worlds are not very expansive, it can take anyone not even 2 minutes to walk from one side to the other.\n-The games levels also kind of seem unfinished, they made landscaping where they wanted you to go. Only one level was actually good, it was kind of a swampy level.\n-Small variety in enemies.\nOver all, this game was a bit rushed, or it was someones first project, I have no clue. If you have an hour or two to waste, buy this game, it's only $0.49.\n","May 15","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a very simple game, not terribly difficult (though there is a level I'm stuck on so I haven't managed to finish the game yet), it's loads of fun to just dart around and blast the living crap out of (nearly) everything that moves. For the price, you can't go wrong, but if you're hesitant about spending the $5 (at the time of this writing), wait till a sale and pick it up then. Don't go into it expecting AAA graphics and story and you'll have fun, if only for a few hours.","November 25, 2013","true","1.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I don't care about the graphics, which doesn't look good, but the game is simply not fun to play.\n\nYou have 6 different weapons (that you collect as you progress) with which you can kill/stun your enemies, but the enemy variety is little, and basically it's always a question of running around the enemies to avoid being hit and shoot them until they die. Levels are really small, and with the instructions + map it's very easy to finish them.\n\nSound effects are basic, and there's no story to get involved with. A plus of the game is the options' menu, very rich, but all in all I simply wouldn't recommend playing the game. Pick it up only if it's heavily discounted.\n\nOne final thing: on Mac, this game crashed once while I was playing, and once it failed to launch.","August 9, 2015","false","3.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Also, there's something about shooting a dead tree, and bringing it back to life, then getting more orb things to upgrade your super powers.\n\nAudio quality is very mixed, with some levels having nice music, and others being absolutely shocking.

The most creative idea in Caster (reforming terrain with weapons) is only used functionally in 2 levels in the main storyline in 2 short puzzles. The shooting gameplay involves very little thought, you'll find yourself spamming the attack button with the reticle pointed in the general direction of the enemies alot while running in circles or backwards to avoid getting hit. Enemy AI is extremely predictable, they literally do the same thing every time without variation, e.g. everytime you shoot a certain type of bug, it will jump into the air & land until you shoot it again, another type of enemy walks back a specific number of units every time it gets hit.\n\nIf you can sell the cards you get & essentially get the game for free, then you might as well try it, but I doubt you will enjoy it. Most 5th/early 6th gen store attack shooters are better.","March 25, 2015","false","3.6"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cucumbericepepsi/recommended/29800/","cucumbericepepsi","telos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cucumbericepepsi/","669 products in account","Drawing inspiration from such blockbusters as Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing and Jurassic Park: Trespasser, elecorn presents to you his magnum opus, Caster. In Caster, you follow the legend of a young boy (or a feminine frame boy), his face tragically crippled at birth by low poly counts, fighting against an unknown alien threat known as FLANX, determined to sit there and do nothing or walk at innocent humans in straight lines as they go about their day. To defeat such a menacing threat our hero is granted the power of super speed and must fly through rin- I mean collect orbs of power, granting him powers such as running up vertical walls, jumping so high he crosses the entire level, and homing missiles that _very_ accurately track their enemies.\n\nThe game also features a myriad of references to previous grand slam titles often overlooked by the casual gamer. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics are a reference to Final Fantasy 7, one of elecom's favorite games when he was 5. The physics reference legendary racer Big Rigs, with the ability to instantly stop while running 172839127 mph. And of course, who could forget the large number of bullets and badly drawn characters, clearly a reference to ZUN and Touhou.\n\nCaster's main strength is in its simplicity and accessibility. With levels lasting between 3 seconds and 2 minutes, you don't have to worry about a commitment when you sit down; you can simply play! The controls are very intuitive; some may critcize the heavy mouse acceleration, but it's by design so that all players, newbies and pros alike, have equal trouble aiming and controlling their character ensuring a balanced experience no matter who's playing.\n\nHowever, no matter the level of quality of a game there are always a few negative points, and Caster is no exception... one of them being that there are some issues with the PC port of this game. In the optimization process from Linux to Windows and Mac, a large amount of autism was left in. I for one cannot stand for excess autism in my games, and so I cannot ignore this sloppy port job, no matter the quality of the actual game. Further, in his rush to get the game out for the holidays (a goal which he ultimately failed at, thanks to Steam wrongfully delaying his game in their rigorous review process), elecom unfortunately left the game unfinished. Not in the traditional way though, where devs don't have time to add their layer of polish, but actually unfinished. When you attempt to enter the final level you are given a "To Be Continued" screen. What's there is golden, but what COULD have been there could have been so much more...  It's a real shame elecom didn't get to finish his title, as it would have been a good nominee for game of the year.\n\nIn the end Caster will be put on the long list of visionary video games tragically cut short by time and budget constraints, dreams brought down by the crushing reality of checkbooks and deadlines. Do yourself a favor and pick up elecom's game. For only 99 cents, you can't really go wrong. You don't need supersize fries anyway. I give this game a 7/10.","December 29, 2012","true","2.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","2"

In caster you play as a rookie caster who is asked to fight off a deadly waves of aliens called flanx. It gives you diffrent powers to fight them which is cool because some of those powers are pretty cool. The worlds you visit look awfull and look dull its just fields of nothing. The flanx types look awfull and sometimes just a pain in the ♥♥♥ to fight them off. With infinite lives you cant die so that helps to fight some of the tougher enemies. But some missions are a pain in the ♥♥♥ such as Acid meadows. In that missions you have to escort a boat by lifting up the ground through the acid lake and the boat can be destroyed. Overall this game is just awfull in all ways horrible graphics, bland worlds, terrible gunplay and awfull enemies its just a title you need to stay away from so if you want to buy it be warned i give this game a 2/10","July 29, 2013","false","5.3"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

I'm unsure if it's accostumed to XInput or DirectInput... Anyway, the controls are pretty simple and fluid, since it's the basic move-shoot-jump combo with a Dash button. You have an upgrade system, in which you can up your shield (Lifebar), your pickup distance, Super Jump, Dash (which becomes really handy as you go on), along with the six weapons. The graphics are reminiscent of the early PS2 era, meaning that if your computer is the equivalent of a toaster you shouldn't have any problems running it. You have three difficulties - Casual, Normal, and Hardcore - that are all functional in their own way. You have a good bunch of levels, though the objectives are straightforward. The gameplay in itself feels like a cross between Megaman Legends and a Bullet Hell, when you have loads of enemies. The music has a touch of electronica, neither ill-advised nor well-suited, but it gets the job done. The story's pretty simple, as you're a completely new Caster trying to go up against an alien race known as Flanx. As usual, it's all up to you as you traverse through the game. As you power up your weapons, you're going to have to play a little bit differently as each weapon intensifies its use - as an example, Blast blows small craters on its first upgrade, developing into giant holes as you further upgrade. The scenery, as advertised, shifts along with the battles you have in the level, in a level of terraforming I haven't seen in any game of yet - reminding me a bit of the Dragon Ball Z series, in a way. It's not exactly a time-sinker, as it is Single-Player, but it's always good for a round or two if you're a little bit bored. It does have mods, but you need to go to the game's site to get them. At the time of this review, there's only one modpack - that assumes you have everything upgraded, as it ups the challenge. Perhaps if this game had enough of a fanbase, it might qualify for a Steam Workshop...?\n\ntl;dr - Forgettable if you let it slide back into your games library not to touch it, but your first playthroughs are decisively fun and entertaining, and likely enough to keep you entertained.\n\n4/5 - Gameplay\n3/5 - Sound\n3/5 - Graphics\n\nFINAL SCORE:\n3/5 - Reasonable!","February 1, 2015","true","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BringTheNoiseGaming/recommended/29800/","BringTheNoiseGaming","C3LT1C W4RCRY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BringTheNoiseGaming/","63 products in account","Steam Game Review: Caster\n\n\n\n\nAs many avid gamers out there know, Steam is an absolute must have when it comes to buying and/or sharing games and gaming experiences. There is an innumerable amount of content on Steam that can tickle the fancy of pretty much anybody out there. Among these games, is that of "Caster."\n\nFirst, let's start with the basics. Pretty much any sale that Steam advertises on their 'Store' page, features this game. It's no more than a quarter (25 cents) every time a sale happens, so with that said, there really isn't too much reason NOT to get it. Let's face it, 25 cents really doesn't get you a whole lot nowadays as it is... You're lucky if you can get a giant gumball for that price at your local grocery store.\n\nCaster is a neat little game that was developed by Elecorn, who is in turn an indie developer. With this said, one should definitely take into consideration the fact that the graphics won't be up to "par" as say a major developer's game (Bethesda, 2K Games, Activision, etc) would be. That's not to say that graphics are everything, however. The game does a great job of launching the player into this world that could be described as styled after an old Nintendo 64 3D platformer, much like Mario 64 or Banjo-Kazooie. Keeping this in mind, a controller adds to this nostalgic feel as the camera angles and movement work in much the same manner. Once the player goes through a brief tutorial mission, explaining how things work, the game then takes the player on a journey through a very outlandish world. It incorporates a rough combat system that puts a slowly unlocked arsenal of various lasers at the player's disposal. Each of these weapons serves a purpose on each level, and it's up to the player to use that noggin of theirs to figure out how each weapon applies to the current mission.\n\nWith the mention of weapons, and missions, there is a neat little "leveling up" system that happens as well. With each mission the player can destroy enemies and shoot trees to gain an in-game currency, which in turn let's the player upgrade various abilities as well as the lasers. These abilities include the ability to run faster or jump higher, for instance. Cool right? In fact, once some of these abilities are upgraded, the missions become a flatout breeze to go through in some instances. This could be looked at as a good thing, or a bad thing, depending on who the player is. That said, I'll leave that up to interpretation.\n\nWhile nostalgia, loads of money to grab, and fun ways to outsmart the enemy are fun... This game falls short, and detrimentally so, in a few other, more crucial areas. First off, there is no real "story." This is absolutely key when it comes to immersing the player. Without a story... there's very little that will actually make the player feel as though anything is getting accomplished.\n\nAnother big problem with this game is the fact that the enemies are almost static in a sense. They have no real movement styles and the ability to decimate them by the thousands is absolutely comical. There's no real combat mechanics that the player needs to acquire in order thwart the enemy and whatever threat they pose in this distant place where nobody seems to know what's going on. This, in and of itself, can absolutely destroy the experience.\n\nSo... we have lots of guns, a "leveling" system, nostalgia that is offset by lack of story and no real challenge. The bad can offset the good, or vice versa. And maybe it wouldn't be all that bad if that was all there is to the story, however, it's not. Speaking of "all there is to the story," this game, above all things, is NOT COMPLETE. Judging by the looks of things, it won't ever be completed by the developer. This poor little gem of a game has been left incomplete for quite some time now (years, in fact) and the developer has yet to blink an eye at it. It's really quite a shame too, because there is so much potential here. All it needs just a little TLC and just a bit of polishing and this game could turn out to get the recognition that it (potentially) deserves. But don't hold your breath.\n\nOn a sidenote, however, I would like to include the fact that the developer was courteous enough to include an actual mission editor and level designer that allows players to fill in holes or create a whole new world. I have tried the editor out, and while it is somewhat wonky at first, I am highly appreciative that Elecorn allowed for the followers of the game the ability to take things into their own hands, if need be. In fact, there is also a section on the Caster/Elecorn website that allows for community submissions to be downloaded by the public to play. So... at least the "DLC" is free.\n\nTaking ALL of this into account, I enjoyed my time with the game. And for only 25 cents, I enjoyed it even more. Given that it might take some imagination on the player's part to keep things going, it's well worth the small donation to try. That is... if you are willing to overlook the terribly awful state the game was left in.\n\n(Here's to hoping that at some point in time Elecorn revisits this 'pound puppy' of video games gives it the attention that it deserves.)\n\nFor more information on Caster or download the game, please visit:\n\nhttp://www.elecorn.com/caster3d/index.html\n\n\n\nBe sure to check out my other content!\n\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9wBb1EsrvF6mEPTWD1d0qA\n\nBlog: http://btngaminggamereviews.blogspot.com/\n\nTumblr: http://bringthenoisegaming.tumblr.com/\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @BTN_Gaming","September 13, 2015","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I think the development should continue, and maybe in the future this game can earn a sequel, or a revamp in these graphics, because it's really worth it.

The gameplay is easy and quite smooth, killing bug-like things running at you, exiciting terrains, vaious attacks and upgrades and several other factors will add hours to your gameplay :)\n\nOn the flip side, it has some cons too. It lacks some strategy and variety. The game is very short and the levels got only a few enemies, and it also seems that the developers spent more time on the environments rather than the characters.\n\nOverall, this game is awesome !

It doesn't hold any real replay value, and the game itself is very short, but it just doesn't care about itself enough to be anything but silly fun.\n\nPros:\n+ Movement is very smooth\n+ Music is very good for an original indie game.\n+ The attacks are varied and require at least a tiny bit of strategy to complete, even if the game is easy\n+ Levels aren't too binding and rarely serve to frustrate or go on longer than they should\n+ Lots of options to play around with, including controlbinds and difficulty levels\n+Optional objectives in every level for completionist types\n+ Doesn't last any longer than it should, and ends before the fun wears out\n+ Boss levels are pretty satisfying to beat\n+Trading cards!\n\nCons\n\n-Graphics are pretty bad, but forgivable as it feels strangely retro.\n-The game is very, very short. All in all you could get about 4 hours of enjoyment out of this game before it becomes stale\n-The story is plretty much nonexistent.\n-No character development whatsoever\n-No achievements\n-Enemies aren't too well varied\n-Minor gripes with weapons, their hit registration is sometimes off\n-Dash makes the game extremely easy\n-Running up walls and other surfaces essentially cancel out environmental hazards.\n-Some levels are hilariously easy\n\nFinal verdict: 6.5/10\n\nDefinitely worth a go for 14 cents.\nIf you're looking for a bit of silly fun or something new you won't be disappointed .

Regardless, I solely used the Blast weapon throughout the first campaign because none of the others ever offered any advantage. The second, shorter campaign simultaneously makes Caster more interesting and frustrating, posing more thoughtful objectives and stronger enemies yet forcing you to use useless weapons such as the Seeker, whose supposedly "seeking" missiles hit their target about 10% of the time.\n\nFrankly, this game wouldn't have made it past the bargain bin back on the Nintendo 64, and thus it's embarassing to see such an incredibly amateurish product released in 2009, indie or not, at the laughable price of 4.99. The fact that the second campaign still leaves you with a "to be continued" message, five years on, is telling of the fact that Caster has likely been abandoned, and rightly so.","April 18, 2014","false","1.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

This game will have you dashing about at high speeds blasting enemies and altering terrain with several different abilities.\n\nLaunching this game the player's eyes will be assaulted with a fuzzy polygonal mess and a crudely conceived UI design. The nicest piece of art this game has to offer is the Steam thumbnail. Having bad production value doesn't mean a game isn't fun but unfortunately Caster has very little to offer in terms of gameplay. Caster is a third-person shooter with a camera angle that can very from directly behind the player-character to a top down perspective.  It can be fun to zip around the map and lay waste to enemies but the player won't experience this until at least one hour into the game. Caster requires the player to collect energy in order to upgrade abilities and as a result the first hour or so of gameplay is very slow and tedious. After this first hour there will be a brief moment of mild amusement and then the player is immediately introduced to enemies and situations that require a slower playstyle.\n\nIn my opinion the developers would have done well to skip the whole upgrade process that made the first hour or so of gameplay a waste of time and focus on high speed gameplay that this game advertises.\n\nJust shy of two hours, my gameplay experience was ended by getting killed because my character was held motionless for a cutscene. This happened to me two consecutive times.\n\nThis game supports USB controller gameplay however the controls seemed pretty bad (and maybe unworkable). I played with the keyboard and mouse.\n\nScore: 2/10","December 23, 2013","false","3.2"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

I mean, It's kind of not so well done, and very rushed feeling, but It's okay.\n\nIt's basically Sonic with an energy bar. It has a small range of weapons, basically powers for one gun that is given to you. I mean, the game is all skill, sort of. The bosses are tough, regular flying enemies are nearly impossible to kill without a special slowdown gun or whatever, so until you can get that power, those flying enemies are hard as all hell to kill, kind of ruins the game for me. You get your second weapon after a few minutes, then you get a new weapon every level, which just feels overly rushed. The health system is kind of like Halo's, where It's less of being health, and more of a shield, but you can't really die, you just respawn where you died.\n\nOverall,\n4/10\nTL;DR\nCan be enjoyed for a quick ten minutes, gets tedious, and old fast.","April 6, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I know there isn't much of a story here but this is worse than a bad ending, this just seems unfinished.  And given the length of time it's been out I doubt there's much chance we'll see an ending.\n\nOnto the good: it was fun while it lasted.  Nostalgia-inducing retro graphics.  Short, punchy missions.  Very fast paced.  Puts the 'Action' in 'Action Adventure'.  You get drawn in by the fluid gameplay, switching out weaponry to combat the different critters that come your way, sprinting up sheer cliffs, across water, leaping over mountains, all the while tossing huge amounts of colorful munitions at your beast alien foes.\n\nBut then, bam, the rug is pulled from under you.

But alas, as I stream cheap games every Tuesday I just had to try this one, and after 3 hours of streaming me and my viewers were not disappointed.\n\n"Caster" reminded my viewers of Megaman and Sonic games from the past, a genre I was never good at because of the speed of gameplay required. But this game is pretty easy on normal, so I did not die as often as I expected and had a great time killing the few enemies present and gathering the objectives.\n\nThe graphics are simple, but after an hour of playing I did not notice it anymore and was just busy doing things that had to be done to complete the levels. At first I turned down the music in the game, which I often do, but was I wrong: the electronic beats are what make this game better than what you first think when you start it. They push you to greater hights and I would not mind having a few of those songs in my iTunes library.\n\nAfter 3 hours of playing, near the end of my planned streaming session, the game crashed on me, but nothing was lost, I could start it up again and play from where I last was. I have yet to finish it, which I cetrainly will, and do not regret buying this game and spending an evening on it.

I think I got it for about 14 cents on sale, and figured for that low, it was worth a play. Caster is notably a small indie game, but the low graphics and minecraft-reminiscient maps aren't enough to take away from the addictive, and impressive gameplay.\n\nYou jump around all over, and dash, all while attacking with very satisfying weapons, each with their own twist and turns, and most with an alternate fire. The combat is fast-paced and legitimately exciting, and the upgrades eventually make combat a breeze. The difficulty curve is all over the place on this one, but it's still fun to pick up and play for a while.","March 25, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very origional to me, while the graphics are not amazing, they don't really need to be since the gameplay itselt is all that should matter in a game good enough that you could take it and play it anywhere on any computer or laptop.\n\nThe powers are amazing, shaping the land with these powers is both awesome, and hilarious at times. The story is easy enough to understand, nothing spectacular, but enjoyable as a classic tail of a sort of clan that happens to be good at fighting monsters and a new caster that rises up to meet the challenges. I loved the final boss fight from the first chapter, the boss was unique and quite a shocking unexpected surprise to me, I was not prepared, but happy to say I was satisfied with the challenge it was a good, somewhat difficult boss fight.\n\nI hope that the second chapter will be finished soon and that the game will get an amazing climax.\n\nMy only minor dislike, proboably more personal than anything else, is lack of character creation. A little customization would be nice, or perhaps some character skin packs at the very least would be appreciated. Something so people are  not just picking male or female. Not that's it's nessisary, but it would be appreciated.\n\nThank you for making a wonderful game, please continue with it.","March 25, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think I got it for about 14 cents on sale, and figured for that low, it was worth a play. Caster is notably a small indie game, but the low graphics and minecraft-reminiscient maps aren't enough to take away from the addictive, and impressive gameplay.\n\nYou jump around all over, and dash, all while attacking with very satisfying weapons, each with their own twist and turns, and most with an alternate fire. The combat is fast-paced and legitimately exciting, and the upgrades eventually make combat a breeze. The difficulty curve is all over the place on this one, but it's still fun to pick up and play for a while.","March 25, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very origional to me, while the graphics are not amazing, they don't really need to be since the gameplay itselt is all that should matter in a game good enough that you could take it and play it anywhere on any computer or laptop.\n\nThe powers are amazing, shaping the land with these powers is both awesome, and hilarious at times. The story is easy enough to understand, nothing spectacular, but enjoyable as a classic tail of a sort of clan that happens to be good at fighting monsters and a new caster that rises up to meet the challenges. I loved the final boss fight from the first chapter, the boss was unique and quite a shocking unexpected surprise to me, I was not prepared, but happy to say I was satisfied with the challenge it was a good, somewhat difficult boss fight.\n\nI hope that the second chapter will be finished soon and that the game will get an amazing climax.\n\nMy only minor dislike, proboably more personal than anything else, is lack of character creation. A little customization would be nice, or perhaps some character skin packs at the very least would be appreciated. Something so people are  not just picking male or female. Not that's it's nessisary, but it would be appreciated.\n\nThank you for making a wonderful game, please continue with it.","March 25, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Caster represents an awesome idea that actually works and has only one real flaw with it, and that's how it's just too easy (Even so, that's eay to fix.) However, because of its unique style, it will not truly achieve the praise it needs. It's also unfortunate that the game has been essentially discontinued. That doesn't mean the community can't take it up on their own to continue it.\n\n-What is Caster? What genre does it fit into?\nCaster doesn't truly fit into the predefined genres we have today, the closest similar game would be Borderlands. It's definitely a shooting game, and also has some RPG elements. I guess we can call it an FPRPS (First Person Role-Playing Shooter.) It's third-person perspective and simple graphics also gives it that PS1/Arcade feel to it, and it's definitely appealing. Plus it easily gets 60+ fps on even the most burnt potato out there, so anyone can enjoy it.\n\n-Story\nThere isn't much to the story, but the story that is there is enough... barely. All you're truly given is a name to the main enemies and some minor exposition. Basically, not a lot of text boxes.\n\n-Gameplay\nThis is where Caster truly does shine. To start off, your character has free roam over wherever you are. As such you are given the ability to dash and super jump (which is a powerful double jump) to enhance the fun of it. With the base dash and jump, you're not moving very far or going very high, but as you upgrade you become more epic. Eventually you'll be dashing for longer distances, running on water, and even running on walls. I'll be damned if I could find another game that makes wall-running and shooting both fun and easy.\n\nWhen you start off, you'll only have your basic shooting "ability" "Pulse." It's not very strong starting out looking and behaving very similar to Mega Man's basic attack. It needs to be upgraded to become even better. Missions are where you earn the credits to upgrade this ability. And as you do more missions you'll gain access to more abilities, each with their unique-ness.\n\nEnvironment interaction. For a game off this size, it's incredible to have environments that are fully interactable. A lot of things can cause craters to form, from both you and enemies. If you super jump and fall long enough, you can leave a small crater and create a shockwave. Your basic shots can build craters too. You can even get an ability to create hills, to get bonuses underwater mainly. There's even one instance where enemies will try to stay underground and take pot shots at you.\n\nEnemies, however, is the only true point where the game doesn't shine. The enemies in Caster are way too easy. Upgrades for abilities just do massive amounts of damage, and enemies don't get adjusted for this in each level as you progress. Eventually, even on hard, you'll get to a point where you're just like: "That's cool, and now it's dead. Next level." It's a damn shame too, because adaptive enemies would pad out the gameplay much better than spreading them out. Too bad that'll never be fixed :c\n\n-tl;dr gameplay\nSonic the Hedgehog + Mega Man + Borderlands - Difficult AI = Caster\n\n-Modding\nWhile I'm not truly a "Modder" (At the time of writing, at least) Caster looks way more than simple to mod. There is mod support from what I can tell at the time of writing this. I would also wager that this game would be a perfect start for getting into modding, as it's so simple and open to the idea of community-created content. Hell, why stop at making single-player campaigns? You could probably add some sort of multiplayer to this game easier than any other indie game on Steam. This might be where the game has a future, and it would be up to the community.","March 28, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sense of speed you get (once you get Dash past level 1) is also pretty cool.\n\nHowever, the game looks primitive, if functional, and the missions seem incredibly dull. Admittedly, I only did about 10 missions, but the environments weren't interesting and the objectives were overly simple. Enemy AI is awful. There's a blob that literally does nothing unless you run into it (it doesn't even move), and some kind of walking worm thing that you just stunlock by hitting it every few seconds. On top of that, all the enemies are bullet sponges.\n\nAny fun you get from the sense of running around at ludicrous speeds is undermined by the fact that all you really do is circle-strafe and pump shots into bullet-sponge enemies. If you stop moving, you die quickly. The sense of speed is appealing for a few minutes, but that's about it. There are no checkpoints in missions, and most of them involve a lot of running through bland landscapes.","March 29, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is not because I don't like old games, it is simply that this game isn't the most "feature-ful" of higher priced games.

A beautiful mix of modern and retro styles; the music, the physics, the monsters... this is definitely a game you might expect to find in a modern cici's pizza arcade room. It's the kind of game you'd spend $25 in quarters on over the course of just one summer. That is, if you're playing on hard mode. Casual and novice gamers can still play for hours on end, but a certain balance of the environment is lost without feeling the heat. Either way, it's an eerily elegant adventure with little story and expansive gameplay. Only two things are missing to make this game an instant classic: a music album for purchase, and multiplayer mode, but something tells me both are in the works.\n\nSo, yeah, you've got a great deal staring you in the face.

Caster represents an awesome idea that actually works and has only one real flaw with it, and that's how it's just too easy (Even so, that's eay to fix.) However, because of its unique style, it will not truly achieve the praise it needs. It's also unfortunate that the game has been essentially discontinued. That doesn't mean the community can't take it up on their own to continue it.\n\n-What is Caster? What genre does it fit into?\nCaster doesn't truly fit into the predefined genres we have today, the closest similar game would be Borderlands. It's definitely a shooting game, and also has some RPG elements. I guess we can call it an FPRPS (First Person Role-Playing Shooter.) It's third-person perspective and simple graphics also gives it that PS1/Arcade feel to it, and it's definitely appealing. Plus it easily gets 60+ fps on even the most burnt potato out there, so anyone can enjoy it.\n\n-Story\nThere isn't much to the story, but the story that is there is enough... barely. All you're truly given is a name to the main enemies and some minor exposition. Basically, not a lot of text boxes.\n\n-Gameplay\nThis is where Caster truly does shine. To start off, your character has free roam over wherever you are. As such you are given the ability to dash and super jump (which is a powerful double jump) to enhance the fun of it. With the base dash and jump, you're not moving very far or going very high, but as you upgrade you become more epic. Eventually you'll be dashing for longer distances, running on water, and even running on walls. I'll be damned if I could find another game that makes wall-running and shooting both fun and easy.\n\nWhen you start off, you'll only have your basic shooting "ability" "Pulse." It's not very strong starting out looking and behaving very similar to Mega Man's basic attack. It needs to be upgraded to become even better. Missions are where you earn the credits to upgrade this ability. And as you do more missions you'll gain access to more abilities, each with their unique-ness.\n\nEnvironment interaction. For a game off this size, it's incredible to have environments that are fully interactable. A lot of things can cause craters to form, from both you and enemies. If you super jump and fall long enough, you can leave a small crater and create a shockwave. Your basic shots can build craters too. You can even get an ability to create hills, to get bonuses underwater mainly. There's even one instance where enemies will try to stay underground and take pot shots at you.\n\nEnemies, however, is the only true point where the game doesn't shine. The enemies in Caster are way too easy. Upgrades for abilities just do massive amounts of damage, and enemies don't get adjusted for this in each level as you progress. Eventually, even on hard, you'll get to a point where you're just like: "That's cool, and now it's dead. Next level." It's a damn shame too, because adaptive enemies would pad out the gameplay much better than spreading them out. Too bad that'll never be fixed :c\n\n-tl;dr gameplay\nSonic the Hedgehog + Mega Man + Borderlands - Difficult AI = Caster\n\n-Modding\nWhile I'm not truly a "Modder" (At the time of writing, at least) Caster looks way more than simple to mod. There is mod support from what I can tell at the time of writing this. I would also wager that this game would be a perfect start for getting into modding, as it's so simple and open to the idea of community-created content. Hell, why stop at making single-player campaigns? You could probably add some sort of multiplayer to this game easier than any other indie game on Steam. This might be where the game has a future, and it would be up to the community.","March 28, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sense of speed you get (once you get Dash past level 1) is also pretty cool.\n\nHowever, the game looks primitive, if functional, and the missions seem incredibly dull. Admittedly, I only did about 10 missions, but the environments weren't interesting and the objectives were overly simple. Enemy AI is awful. There's a blob that literally does nothing unless you run into it (it doesn't even move), and some kind of walking worm thing that you just stunlock by hitting it every few seconds. On top of that, all the enemies are bullet sponges.\n\nAny fun you get from the sense of running around at ludicrous speeds is undermined by the fact that all you really do is circle-strafe and pump shots into bullet-sponge enemies. If you stop moving, you die quickly. The sense of speed is appealing for a few minutes, but that's about it. There are no checkpoints in missions, and most of them involve a lot of running through bland landscapes.","March 29, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But alas, as I stream cheap games every Tuesday I just had to try this one, and after 3 hours of streaming me and my viewers were not disappointed.\n\n"Caster" reminded my viewers of Megaman and Sonic games from the past, a genre I was never good at because of the speed of gameplay required. But this game is pretty easy on normal, so I did not die as often as I expected and had a great time killing the few enemies present and gathering the objectives.\n\nThe graphics are simple, but after an hour of playing I did not notice it anymore and was just busy doing things that had to be done to complete the levels. At first I turned down the music in the game, which I often do, but was I wrong: the electronic beats are what make this game better than what you first think when you start it. They push you to greater hights and I would not mind having a few of those songs in my iTunes library.\n\nAfter 3 hours of playing, near the end of my planned streaming session, the game crashed on me, but nothing was lost, I could start it up again and play from where I last was. I have yet to finish it, which I cetrainly will, and do not regret buying this game and spending an evening on it.

The graphics are ridiculously dated. Older farts like me will remember the original "Jedi Knight" with an early 3D add-on card that looked amazing. We're talking mid-to-late 1990s here. Yes, this game looks worse than that.\n\nAs much as I hate to admit it, as crappy as the graphical quality is, the game is actually kind of fun but not for prolonged amounts of time. It doesn't take much to build up your various characteristics (weapons, shield, speed, etc.) and you're not going to get a lot of gameplay out of it.\n\nBuy this game when it's available for less than $.50 and mess around with it until you get your cards.

Yep this is that game.\n\nSo, it's Caster. The game where you shoot blue balls at dead trees and get bigger balls that is apparently money/exp? (I dont know) In Caster you play as the male protagonist or the feamale protagonist. Both character models are scary so there really is no difference whom you choose. As you choose your demon *ahem* character you are brought to a tutorial level (Thank God). The tutorial actually has a great way of explaining things when you dont know what the f**k is happening, because without the tutorial it just be a clusterf**k of you trying to figure out what to do. As you enter your first mission you are greeted with a hilled level with dead trees everywhere even though the grass is perfectly alive. Like the person I am, I imediatly started to shoot the dead trees. And boy did it spring back to life. Anywho your purpose on the hilled plains is to eliminate enemies in the area. What are the enemies you ask? Slugs from hell. After you send the demon slugs back to hell, it's time to return to your mothership, aka the light beam coming from the sky. And mission complete! After that you're brought up to an upgrade screen. So you do that and it's on to your next mission. From this point on its just the same thing except for a few varients (i.e. swamp places, hills, more hills, plains, even more hills, and a level with a f**king death pit in the middle)\n\nPros-\n*The music (I guess)\n*The perfect game to play on earth day!\n*Kill  demons\n*Left-click to shoot like a wizard\n\nCons-\n*Bland levels\n*Generic characters\n*Is this a tech demo?\n*Minor glitches\n*Character models (They stare into your soul man ;_;)\n*Weird camera (It just feels wrong)\n\nFinal Verdict: 6/10\nThis game could have been good. Really im not joking! This is a game with a lot of potential, but in the end fails to deliver. The game also seems to be abadoned and left to rot. But hey, they did make a game. Just try to make a 3d game.\n\nI DARE YA\n\n-Evan\n\nP.S.

A person different than I would likely say "Nuff Said", but maybe someone wants another review that has something to do with the actual game. This is a game that looks old, feels old, and shouldn't be bought for anything over 3 American dollars. This is not because I don't like old games, it is simply that this game isn't the most "feature-ful" of higher priced games.

Casual and novice gamers can still play for hours on end, but a certain balance of the environment is lost without feeling the heat. Either way, it's an eerily elegant adventure with little story and expansive gameplay. Only two things are missing to make this game an instant classic: a music album for purchase, and multiplayer mode, but something tells me both are in the works.\n\nSo, yeah, you've got a great deal staring you in the face.

And like most rich people, I went a little crazy with my spending... I was out of control! I stumbled across this game, on sale for 14 cents. Pretty expensive, right? I spent a few hours pondering if this was a wise investment. I was practically throwing money away! But, eventually, I gave in to temptation. I bought the game. As I loaded it up, devastated by the massive dent it put in my fortune, I thought I might hate it. I knew I would hate it. How could it be good? I did hate it, at first. The tutorial and first mission where super boring, but brief. I made it to the second level. It was a challenge, a real challenge! Enimies where flying around me, shooting their lazers at my face. Craters formed around the world, as I smashed into the ground after performing a super jump... it was great. It's certainly no tomb raider, but for 14 cents... it was worth a buy.","March 29, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game doesn't look great, or even play very great, but it's not bad for wasting an hour or two, but that's pretty much all the playtime you will get from it, the first level was quite difficult if only because of the speed that the enemies move, and how slow you are until you have a few upgrades, after you have bought an upgrade or two though the difficulty nose dives, with only giant homing missile seeking firing rock? monsters being the only thing that can really hurt you, though with ant of the starter weapons maxed out they do go down fairly quickly.

But I am going to hang this over his head and get more gifts from him. Can't give it a rating so I am going to give it an IGN rating.\n9/10 nothing is wrong with it.","March 26, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has an intersting mechanic of ground destruction and growth, which you can use to gather collectables, or defeat enemies in unique ways. over all for the cheap price and since i got it on a 95% sale, the game is worth what you pay for and a pretty enjoyalbe experience.","March 26, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Goodness, I bloody LOVED the game's music~ The gameplay was also great, and considering I only paid £0.10 for it, it made it all the better! Very few issues with the game, my only qualm being the overwhelming damage one of the enemies does to you in one of the levels near the end. Otherwise, it's a Nine-and-one-half out of Ten from me.","March 27, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
