Not possible to skip forward through intro-screens. Not even possible to control flying with keyboard or mouse. Poor graphics.

The VR aspect is there but the graphics ruin the experience.  Freeware for the DK2 blows this away. I would avoid it.","June 3, 2015","false","0.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

This is one of the stable ones for me.\n\nThe Eagle Flight captures many moments of "WOW cool", acceleration, height, and its a light weight world meaning that the graphics are simple enough that the flight is just so smooth - feels like I jumped into a scene on the old cartoon the "Thunder-cats" or something.\n\nCons:\n\nAny game requiring X-Box controller on a PC game is lame - because I know it doesn't take that much longer to add STANDARD PC support.... ON A PC! Nothing gets me more fumed than buying something that leaves off the advertisement page "REQUIRES X-BOX CONTROLLER"... making games for a pc that only work with X-Box controllers, especially without stating so loudly, is just lame in my "programmer as a career, now semi retired" mind.","August 8, 2015","true","2.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","0"

I downloaded it 2 hours ago and i canÂ´t stop playing. The Flight Simulator is so amazing.\nThe graphics is very nice and clear on an Oculus Rift DK2. For me one of the best VR experience.

The music is really beauiful relaxing and fits perfectly with the poetic and oniric environment. The flight controls are very intuitive and it's a pleasure to fly around and explore. One of my top Oculus experience, ideal to show to newcomers to VR.\nOnly a couple of things could be improved imo: a better plane sound reflecting the changes in speed, and a couple of textures could be in a higher resolution in the ship. Otherwise, everything is near perfect and make this game a pleasure to play when I need to relax a bit!\nGood job.","June 5, 2015","true","0.3"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","5","12","2","0"
