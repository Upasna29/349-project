There is not enough player. (this is also the killing facter for most failed trading card games.)\nThe game server is a ghost town and i waited whole 10 min and no one has come online to play. And this is during orlygift giveaway so there should be people around to try out the game.\n\n2. The interface is bad... It's too tight together with small fonts and the fonts color are bad contrast to the back ground.\nIt's kinda make my eyes bleed looking at it.\n\n3. Above 2 is quite enough.. Even through there are other small flaws such as confusing tutorial mission..\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game to anyone because it's a failed project.\nIt's got good concept but lack solid money to promot it. It also lack even careful development for better interface and explaination...\n\nYou end up playing the same AI computer over and over to very slowly get cards to improve your deck instead of playing against humans.\n\n4/10 would be my final rating... unless by a great miracle that they make a TV or Cartoon for it.. It's a failed Trading card game like many many others...","October 10, 2015","false","2.9"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","18","20","3","1"

I really do.\nCollectible Card Games have a special place in my cold, black, gamer heart. Nanofights, however, is missing much of what makes a CCG fun and entertaining, you know, good.\n\nMost of the card artwork is good. Some of it is very good, a few pieces of it are poor, and a handful are *ahem* closely resembling other copyrighted material (like the Ork Truck card for the Outlaws faction - Games Workshop™ might not appreciate that one).\n\nDistressingly, there are several other areas where the game is simply mediocre to just plain bad.\n\nThe UI is atrocious. It functions, but it feels like a tacked on, overly-graphic layer sitting on top of a form page engineered for database calls, along with a chat window and players online (none to one, in my playtime). Organizing your deck isn't intuitive. The tools are there, but they aren't easy to use, and trying to see the cards you have without a lot of bulls**t getting in the way prevents you from building a new deck without a lot of time and hassle.\n\nThe gameplay is awful. The actual underlying cards and mechanics seem solid, if not tired and already done by better games (Mojang's Scrolls comes to mind). Again, the UI for card battles makes for an underwhelming and sometimes confusing experience. The sounds are terrible; I had to turn them off. Actual combat is resolved in turns too fast to see clearly what happened and why, meaning you really have to know all the cards in play and their effects and how they'll play out before turns end to grasp that round's results. If there was more substance and interesting effects going on, and slower turn resolution to allow you take in the round at a glance and enjoy it, the game would be much, much better.\n\nIn its current state, I simply cannot recommend Nanofights. The price tag is concerning, too. I didn't pay for my copy, but if I hadn't won a key from orlygift, I could have downloaded this game on my phone and played for free. And maybe on that platform, the game's flaws wouldn't have been such a letdown. On PC, though, they are far too glaring and distracting to allow for much enjoyment from this game for all but the most die-hard, IDGAF players of CCGs out there.\n\nGame Score: 3 out of 10 Cosmic Dragons","October 23, 2015","false","0.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

Other than that it seems like a well thought out sci-fi universe card game, borrowing and blending together traits from different classical origins, surely the author put soul in the work. Still don't buy it if you're not especially into sci-fi & card games.\n\nСразу чувствуется, что это игра на Яве, как только прикасаешься к ее интерфейсу, такому перегруженному, у которого также какие-то нелады с регистрацией нажатий. В остальном это похоже на карточную игру в продуманной фантастической вселенной, где позаимствованы и слиты воедино черты из разных классических источников, автор явно вложил душу.

The battle aspect, placement is great for this kind of tactical card games. What turns me off is the control, buttons and overlay. It feels impossible to drag the card to the battlefield and requires several attempts. The buttons are hard to differentiate and trying to build a deck is impossible. My cards just suddenly disappear and clicking show all cards does not show any. Trying to read and get explaination from a card is impossible. I still do not understand what the crosshair means and whether a card has any other effect. Graphic is poor and ui is non intuitive. Overall it is a poorly made game and i was surprise that it uses java to launch the game.","December 5, 2015","false","1.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is just you and the AI. With only 1 deck to play with, and only with the AI, it bores you down very fast.\n\nIt would be great if there are more players in the server to play with, so the card fights will be more interesting, witty and fun. Until then, i couldn't recommend anyone at this price point, even though i got this game for free...","October 9, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
