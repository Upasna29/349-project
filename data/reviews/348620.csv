Written in flash, so almost no issue playing in Windows system as it's installed in most of the machines.\n\nGame's a bit short, about one hour and almost no interaction except pressing buttons to proceed through dialogues and collect key items. There's no violence and gore or adult material, feel free to play together with family.\n\nWhat's interesting for this game is that it brings some moral lessons along with the story. Not anything revolutionary, but still good.\n\nWith free price tag, no harm in picking this up and finishing it, even if you're not a fan of VN.

As every day went on I felt as if I was Cantus and I felt the sorrows and smiles that he was expressing through his own thoughts and projecting to Maris.\nIt made me stop and think about my own life and really made me just... open my eyes and come to a sudden realisation what my father does for me. I don't notice much but he does a lot just like Cantus's mother.\n\nAs the story got to the end so did my emotions and thoughts about the game. I absolutely loved every single bit of this game and I am officially hooked onto this genre.\nThat being said I cried in the last scene, it was so beautiful and made me smile at the same time when Cantus finally cried and smiled for his mother and appreciated everything she did for him growing up to the present. It was the perfect ending to a story.\n\nI highly recommend this game to ANYONE that has a spare hour of their lives as I'm sure it will be an hour well spent.","April 8, 2015","true","1.0"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","3"

Cantus is a moody teenager with no friends, but that all changes when he meets Maris, the cheerful, always happy and playful girl by the sea.\n\nCantus reguarly visits the beach alone, until he finds Maris, who pops up out of nowhere. Maris sparks Cantus' feelings and breaks him out of his emotional shell, his sea shell :3.\n\nThis is a quite smaller visual novel than most, but it has a short, but sweet story.\n\nThe art of the game is truly stunning in comparison to most free-to-play novels, which really makes this game appeal to me as the audience. The music is very cute and suits the corresponding part of the story very well.\n\nThis story should never be spoilt, as the ending will truly break your heart. I was definitely touched, and just had to play through again. There are only very few characters, which leaves lots of time to connect with each and everyone, may it be; Cantus, Maris or Cantus' Mother.\n\nI enjoyed this game very much and appreciated every single bit of it.\nI would rate this 10/10, but as of now, there is no sequel, so a 9.5/10 will have to do.\n\nDefinitely install this game, as it is truly, life changing.","January 25","true","6.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","1"

She introduces herself as Maris, they continue to talk. Cantus doesnt understand why this girl is talking to him but he allows her intrusion into his closed world, by the end of this meeting Maris makes Cantus a promise, that she will make Cantus smile.\n\nAs far as the story is concerned Voices from the Sea is a Slice of Life / Drama Visual Novel with a somewhat mysterious tone to it, having bought the game instead of just getting the free version I received the experience the creator had originally envisioned.\n\nAnd wow it is something, this story was so interesting to me that I reread the whole VN several times when I first got it, Im not sure if this will be the same for everyone but it really made me think.\n\nSound wise the music is outstanding the use of music is great and complements both the story and the overall feel of the VN. The only grievance is ultimately the voice acting, and this is understandable and easily forgiven as your drawn into the lives of the characters.\n\nThe Art I find to be very well done and not just the characters, the backgrounds too are visually appealing, the style of the VN is typical anime art, but that is usually what you can expect with a Visual Novel, however somehow and I cant really put it into words, Voices from the Seaeven though yes it uses the same style as many other VN's it defines itself and stands out from the crowd.\n\nVoices from the Sea is a very character-focused VN, length wise it is not the longest I have come across, but it doesn't need to be; it tells its story well in the period of time needed, any longer and the feel would be completely off, as if to make it worse by drawing it out so though some will be disappointed at its short length it is for the best.\n\nOverall Voices from the Sea is beautifully written piece of work; It is visually appealing, the characters are interesting, Cantus's journey is worth investing in, as is finding out more about the mysterious girl Maris.\n\nI'll leave you with this, Voices from the Sea  is a great read and will no doubt keep you interested throughout its duration, and its absolutely free if that's not a good reason to check it out I don't know what is....so Why not give it a try and if you enjoy it I would highly recommend getting Voices from the Sea Plus.\n\n(Like all my reviews I do not put a score as it is my belief that games like all forms of art are subjective and therefore it is impossible to afix a number to them)","April 12","true","50.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

As for the story, it definitely had some feeling put into it, and I feel that it was well executed given the length of the game.\n\nOverall I recommend this game.

The game was made using Adobe Flash Player and clocks in at around 30 minutes to an hour to beat depending on your reading speed, but trust me when I say it is an hour well spent. My review will be covering the Standard Edition which features no voice work, however, there is a Plus Edition that is fully voiced that I would be very interested in checking it out at a later date.\n\nVoices from the Sea's story had me intrigued from the moment I started to the moment I finished with an unexpected plot twist at the end that was emotionally touching. The dialogue is wonderfully written and the characters are interesting enough to keep you entertained. The soundtrack didn't have many tracks, but the tracks that were there were gorgeously composed with each one playing on cue right when you would expect them. The art style is your pretty typical anime-style, but it does just enough to set itself apart from the rest of the crowd with a little twist that I personally enjoyed more than some of the other Visuals Novels out now.\n\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend Voices from the Sea whether you are a long time fan of Visual Novels or if you are just getting into them for the first time. It's cute, it's entertaining, it's free. Give it a try!","May 15, 2015","true","1.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/katobytes/recommended/348620/","katobytes","KatoBytes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/katobytes/","87 products in account","Eh, theres not really much to say about this one. Really, there isn't... I think. Here we go: Snoozefest from the Sea\n\nMeet Cantus, a reclusive thirteen year old chap. For him, he perceives the motion of life as nothing but a drag, and everything that doesn't constitute remote significance to him is dismissed as "noise", and his only passion resides within the virtues of seashells. He refrains from having any unwarranted interactions with other people, even with his own Mom. Overall he views his life devoid of any happiness. What an ♥♥♥, because you know, God forbid the MC of a visual novel isn't a pretentious snob, right? To be frank, he is by far the most insufferable brat I have witnessed being shown in a game for a while. Though Cantus' views are relatable to some degree, players like me will not be able fathom how his character got past the scripting stage of development, as I sporadically pulled my hairs in frustration of his unimaginative demeanor in-game. During one decisive day in one of the beaches of our aquatic/tropical setting, he encounters the main plot device of this narrative, Maris. Over the course of a week, she tries to make Cantus' smile at least once with promises that she will do so, and maybe pry open the door of opportunity for him to be a more sociable person. One can consider Maris to be the polar opposite of Cantus, as her exuberant, loquacious nature proves so, and with that said the contrast between these two characters is perhaps the only redeemable aspect about this game other than the art, but practically anyone can construct and recognize contrast between two different entities, so this isn't all that special.\n\nThis narrative in general follows a very linear template. There are 7 days in this game, and for a good 5 or so the player/reader will find themselves following the format of having a momentary mischief with Maris, picking up one of the three seashells, sitting through MC's reminiscence of his early days, rinse and repeat. Perhaps the creators made this monotonous pattern with some sort of intention, but as a result of me being so dense as to not figure out why that is I will propose a certain notion: THERE WAS A BETTER WAY TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS. It must take the most absurd   reasoning to so much as presume that your audience won't find this redundant. To cap things off, during Cantus' little reflection, the last few words of the day usually appear after the screen's fade to black. For that impact. It's as if the writers really wanted to impart some sort of idea to me by the end of each of these days, and I have no inhibitions to claim that these guys... tried way too hard.\n\nThis one isn't too much of an issue, but the choice-making features this game brings was also a let-down. There is no bad ending for making the wrong choice, but rather that other choice can only be made once, to add some extra dialogue, and should the player make that same choice again instead of commencing the daily search of seashells, the MC blatantly denies, DENIES your choice, holding you at an inextricable bind until you make the correct choice that proceeds the plot. It's silly, but at least the choices were there to be made, and honestly the game has the prospect of being worse if there were more than one route.\n\nIn the nitty-gritty of things, it is imperative that a story well expresses it's themes if it wants to have any creditable substance in any form. This is my biggest gripe with this game, as it fails to preserve it's themes of social isolation for the entire game. I wish not to adorn my review with long spoiler bars, so I'll keep it simple. What it does wrong it that it manages to ignore the entire emotional (I use this term lightly) drive of the game, and turns the entire quintessence of the plot on it's side by the end of the reading. This was something I witnessed in a more famous novel, Tomoyo After, and it nettles me to no end. To my interpretation, the entire main idea of the game was turned into a more concrete one just for the sake of players not screaming at their screens saying "WTF WAS THAT EDGY TRASH?". I can't stress how disappointed I am by this, just like everything about this game.\n\nIt's free and all, but I implore you, no. It's a waste of time.","April 27, 2015","false","1.1"," 9 of 23 people (39%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","39","9","23","2","0"

Granted, this is both free and very short so there is little cost to you whether you end up liking it or not.\n\nThe most to like about this one is the art and the music, which evoke a calm and contemplative mood, and there are a good number of CGs for its short length. Unfortunately, however, it fails to capitalize on its almost surreal setting, as its other departments are painfully inadequate. It might be that the game has a very low development budget, and free VNs tend to not be as well-written as the ones you have to pay for, but even then, there are much better examples free VNs for PC out there, like the Narcissu series [Stage-nana 2005], or True Remembrance [Shiba Satomi 2006]. The characterizations, motivations and themes here are much too shallow and generic to be memorable, and there is almost no story or scenario to speak of, whereas in the other examples, while they may not necessarily be the pinnacle of writing, they are unique in their own way.\n\nIf we don't consider only free titles then you get phenomenal works like Ever17 [Kid 2002], Little Busters! [Key 2007], Symphonic Rain [Kogado 2004], White Album 2 complete [Leaf 2010]. I do realize that Zeiva (the developers) are an independent group, but they need to try harder to make a favourable impression or to distinguish themselves. For me at least, 'disappointing' best describes the experience.","May 10, 2015","false","0.4"," 6 of 21 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","6","21","0","0"

The tired trope of "serious boy's life changed by Manic Pixie Dream Girl" is not only here in full effect, but exacerbated by his treatment of women as an alien species: the girl is enchanting but incomprehensible and his mother is a nag. If you get feels from this game, I hope it serves as a wake up call rather than reinforcing ideas that harm yourself and the people around you. Your life doesn't have to be like the main character of this visual novel. It's not romantic to hate everyone, it's just sad and lonely. Manic Pixie Dream Girls aren't real. Change your own life.","May 11, 2015","false","0.1"," 3 of 15 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","3","15","0","0"

Now listen, if you want something light and part-of-the-norm this is perfect for you. What I'm about to say may offend any new or older anime/VN fans.\n\n+ Visuals are quite nice, I'd thumbs up on that\n+ For me, setting up animations and VNs are quite difficult to pull off, and good ones are even harder to pull off. So I admire that Zeiva did some nice work on art and animation on this.\n\n- Generic storyline, loner main character meets over-optimistic girl and( while I may not have even gone into depth of the full game) something dramatic will probably happen in the end of the story. While I may not be able to pinpoint the ending, the outcomes are quite predictable.\n- Slow intro with around 30-1 min of just slow slides of intro.\n- The music is quite generic as well, Having listened to the music in VN and Anime for the past 3 years, the style of music is becoming more and more similar in key and style.","April 3, 2015","false","0.1"," 10 of 32 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","10","32","0","0"

In fact, I have just started playing them. And I am glad I have with games like these.\n\nThis novel is not really long. I completed it in one hour. Also, this game is made in Flash (I did not know Steam accepted Flash games!) which makes you unable to use the Steam overlay and such. It is a free to play Visual Novel, so I guess it does not have to be that fancy,\n\nAs for the content of this game, I am glad that I have spent my time playing this game. The visuals are very good and the music is absolutely amazing. They both managed to create a very dreamy yet emotional atmosphere to the game.\nThe story and its moral is good. I think some people can relate more to it than others but it is worth playing for. I know how the main character is feeling at some points. That made it more interesting for me. By the way, if you have not always been so nice to your family, better give this novel a try.\n\nTL;DR: This game is good and does not take long to complete.

W.O.W!!\nOK, My ADHD has been kicking in something ugly for weeks, and have not been able to realy sit down and get into a game, a few days before this, I was mindlessly running through my "que". In two days I racked up over 900+ views! Yup that distracted.\n\nAmong the que was this game. I was thinking about getting into a vidual novel, but did not know what one, so I followed most of them. VOICES FROM THE SEA came up free, so I downloaded it and started it. For a moment, I thought my ADHD was going to steal my time away again, but something made me keep "clicking" and reading. Maybe it was because I could related to the boy in the story. Or maybe when I was his age, I wished something like this would have happened. Regardless of the reason, I blocked out the world, and kept reading.\n\nAfter a couple hours, I finished it. The last few minutes had me running for the tissue - as it was one of those rare(for me) moving stories - the emotional climax will hit you fast - the timing was perfect.  You didnt realize it was going to happen until it did. And even though, you might have suspected the ending, it was OK. It was just the way it was supposed to be.\n\nI was so glad this one was free, as it will definately make me take a look at some other visual novels. But I think I might savor the memory of this one for a bit, before I mash it with another story.\n\nWhile the gfx are colorful and "cute", the storyline, is very mature (in a matter of speaking), and not the typical visual novel - this one would be good for your children - to make them realize just what they REALLY have in life that is important.\n\nRead it today -\n\nps:\nbring a kleenex box too. :-)\n(-macho guys will need paper towels LOL)\n\n","April 12, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I mean here you have this game that is comepletely free and has very positive reviews. On one hand you have a very cute story with very nice art and music, on the other hand though it's very short and it's story doesn't really make that much of an impact compared to other game stories I have came across.\n\nI will admit though that when I saw that this game was funded by Kickstarter I was very wierded out by this. For one thing people actually paid for this to be made? I mentioned that the art was good.... but all you have is small portraits of characters, backgrounds, and a bit of art. I don't think all that is worth 1, 2, $4,509! Now if this all went towards the DLC maybe that would make sense but I have not downloaded the DLC and I don't really plan on it either. What's worse is that if these guys would have waited they probably would have been able to make it easily with the Visual Novel Maker that just recently came out. They possibly could have made this game for about $15 (Or at least the free version, again no exposure to the DLC).\n\nBut I will admit that the game is in fact cute. I liked the story even though it was short and simple. I like the characters and the design they gave them, give me anything thaqt looks like an anime or looks cute and I'll be hooked on it, add free and you got me. The development of Cantis (The main character), while quick, was really good. The interaction between these two characters are really nice as well, Maris and Cantis really make a nice duo. If anything I would like to think of it as a nice slice of life 3 minute anime, like "I Can't Understand What My Husband is Saying"..... OK bad example but it's the only one I could think of at the moment to compare it with.\n\nOverall nice game, but I don't think it deserves these 10/10 ratings, I'm thinking more of 7.8/10, maybe an 8/10. Like I said cute concept, too short of a game.","April 12, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

It's heavily reliant on blue and white for most of its color scheme. Depending on your reading speed, you’re looking at a 40 to 60 minute experience.\n\nThe story has plenty of funny moments and goes for charm and sweetness when the characters aren’t being goofy. You can expect to be a bitter, lonely 13 year old male, at least in the beginning. I strongly suggest taking the dialogue choice that isn’t the seashell one first to maximize your experience since the latter is the critical path.\n\nYou can also expect a lot of seashells by the seashore. Multiple playthroughs will allow you to collect every single seashell if you desire them all.\n\nFinally, I want anime eyes.

Because of its short timframe the drama in this game can't live up to the beutiful scenes we see at the beach and at the end.\n\nAs a note: the editing throughout was briliant, and effects were used to their full potental, it really makes we wonder if this game was actully made in Adobe Flash.\n\nIn conclution, download the game - its free what can go wrong.","December 2, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It is quite short, but that's no problem since I played the free version.  The art is very pretty, the music fits nicely in, and the story itself is compelling despite its length.\n\nThis is a pure visual novel without multiple endings.  Although you do have some dialogue choices, they don't appear to impact the ending (at least in the free version).  I won't spoil the ending, but it was certainly worth it.\n\nI would recommend this for anyone who likes a good story-driven VN as long as they don't mind the single-ending format.  I have not played the $4.99 DLC, but if it adds a decent amount of content, that could definitely be worth it.  I'll be keeping an eye on it to possibly purchase later.","June 28, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I honestly think there should have been more characters in it but i guess that the creators wanted you to trully notice how lonely the main character was.\n\nDue to the lack of characters and length i would usually give this VN a 6/10, but taking in mind the fact that it's a Free-To-Play, ill give it a rate of 8/10, It sure is worth playing.","December 11, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Many will be able to relate to Cantus, the antisocial adolescent protagonist who finds his escape in the sea.  As each day passes, a mysterious girl named Maris will do her best to make you smile.\n\nThe game is very short, about an hour or so in length.  However, don't let this discourage you from playing it.  There is a great short story about family and friendship waiting to be told and maybe even a little self-realization may take place in the process.\n\nBottom line is that this is something you should definitely put the time into playing, it put a smile on my face, that's for sure.","August 10, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I do have to say that I was rather disappointed with this product.\nI did find the art to be rather well-done. However, it suffers in terms of story. The main player character was in a state of depression, but no real reason was given as to why. Not even a passing comment. The other characters weren't as good either (though the other main character was okay). I saw the ending coming from a mile away. By the in-game Day 2, the game pretty much confirmed the ending I had predicted ever since the first textbox.\nThe choices available in-game were rather limited and didn't impact much on the overall outcome. You only have the option of "positive" and "negative" and neither of those really changed anything aside from what is said in dialogue. The shell-collecting minigame is also rather lacking and shares the same issues raised above.\nI suppose I can't really complain much since I have a real lack of VN know-how and hey, y'know, it's free (with the exception of the DLC which just adds some stuff onto it). But its story needs some good improvement and I'm not willing to pay $5 for more story if I couldn't enjoy the main stuff first time around.","December 28, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Maris the mysterious girl by the sea was probaly the best part of the game. The main story (Which I'll try not to ruin) is very interesting, and from it being a young 13 year old who essentially shut out the world is also different. Overall this game I believe can invoke some feelings (which ones up to you), the drawings and animations the game has are great, and really is a cute little story.","December 26, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The difference is that this game is a bit longer - I completed it in about an hour.\n\nCantus (the 13 year old protagonist) is a character you either sympathise with or dislike. I disliked him in the beginning because of his anti-social (and ungrateful) way of looking at life. But I sympathised with him towards the end of the game.\n\nI think the artwork and music work well together. Since it's a kinetic novel: no matter what choices you make, you get the same ending.\n\nIt's difficult to write a review without spoiling the short story, so I'll let you try it for yourself. It's a free  game after all! But I think Voices from the Sea is one of the games you must play at least once in your life.","February 10","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I do have to say that I was rather disappointed with this product.\nI did find the art to be rather well-done. However, it suffers in terms of story. The main player character was in a state of depression, but no real reason was given as to why. Not even a passing comment. The other characters weren't as good either (though the other main character was okay). I saw the ending coming from a mile away. By the in-game Day 2, the game pretty much confirmed the ending I had predicted ever since the first textbox.\nThe choices available in-game were rather limited and didn't impact much on the overall outcome. You only have the option of "positive" and "negative" and neither of those really changed anything aside from what is said in dialogue. The shell-collecting minigame is also rather lacking and shares the same issues raised above.\nI suppose I can't really complain much since I have a real lack of VN know-how and hey, y'know, it's free (with the exception of the DLC which just adds some stuff onto it). But its story needs some good improvement and I'm not willing to pay $5 for more story if I couldn't enjoy the main stuff first time around.","December 28, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

If you like that kinda stuff then this is an excellent  buy if not then still give it a try. I hate visual novels but I did like this one.
