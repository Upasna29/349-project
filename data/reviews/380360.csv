In fact, I even agree with the point that it looks so much like "Cliker Heroes" title. Only better.\n\nLet's just say about clickers in general: they are little games with tendency to keep on going, like, forever. The good side of those games, as I see it, is that you can leave the clicker game going, and even close the game window, and yet it will be playing - for you. All clicker games are about numbers - you starting with 1 coin, then, after 1 hour, you're operating millions, then you learning about googoles... and bigger numbers. At some point, I bet, the Graham number can be achieved through some clicker game...\n\nSo! As I thought when first started some clickers, the process is easy enough - you start the game, making first moves (clicks), and then you go to your business, and the game running itself forward, making some achievements with numbers on its way. Funny thing, but only Tap Tap Infinity was good enough in that. All other clickers after some point getting more and more deserving for your time, to the point where you'll be mindlessly clicking the mouse all day long. All - but not Tap Tap Infinity! Yeah, despite the name. Getting controversial here...\nWith some latest addons, it become one of the most fanciest clickers I've met. It is more stable, and more fair than "Clicker Heroes", where you just can't beat the latest levels normally. All big numbers are messed up in your precious "Clicker Heroes", dear fans, and I really can't even feel sorrow for you, if you still climbing to the upper levels, but not able to achieve them!\n\nOkay, let's summarise: Tap Tap Infinity is your standard clicker game, one of those which I actually can recommend to play if you're wandering what's it is all about. Although if you want all 100 achievements, be prepared to spend dozens of hours on that (I was playing offline mostly, so don't think it is as fast as 14 hours to beat the game). And, besides time, which is still more precious than all those clicker games, to start with... If you still want to try a piece, don't play it with your best mouse (the one which is worth more than 10$). Clicker games are made for killing touchscreens and mouses, keep that in mind.\n\nMy mark will be 6/10. Almost a normal game, and free-ware! But really, better play something more mind-catching.","November 20, 2015","true","13.9"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","29","36","4","8"

I put a few months into the game. As of posting this, I have every achievement in the game (and on steam) except for 3400 and 3600. I'm on my final run, just passing 3260. I expect to be done with this game completely very soon. What clicker game will I play next?\n\nTap Tap Infinity is definitely my choice. When I saw that Clicker Heroes was nearing its end for me, I downloaded Tap Tap Infinity, Time Clickers, and Crusaders of the Lost Idols all on the same night. Each of my clicker games had its own quadrant on my screen (best night of my life if you ask me). This kept going on for maybe a day, then I closed down CotLI. I'll get back to it in the future, but it's too slow paced for my liking.\n\nTime Clickers and Tap Tap Infinity were the 2 remaining. After browsing and considering every achievement, every upgrade, and every aspect of the game in general, I decided to stick with Tap Tap Infinity. Clicker Heroes got stale after 97% of the achievements, Crusaders of the Lost Idols is too slow, and Time Clickers is just too damn massive. Thousands and thousands of time cube upgrades. Weapon cubes weren't even near my horizon.\n\nTap Tap Infinity has just the right amount of content, a well-balanced fairness to it regarding gems especially, and you progress pretty quickly, which is ideal for an incremental game. Also praise the left/right mouse clicking!\n\nIf you've played Cookie Clicker, AdVenture Capitalist, or Clicker Heroes and you enjoyed it at least a little bit, try this one out. If you like it, great! If you don't, you lose nothing.","November 29, 2015","true","998.7"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","16","18","3","1"

What im surprised people didnt rally go to respect is the animations for this game, and the 3d modeling. i think it really adds alot of, i dont really know how to say it, but i just like it, okay?  This game is amazing and 10 times better, mabye even 100's time better. ill go over the pros and cons here.\n\nPROS:\nDedicated Developer\nStoryline\nInfinity Tokens ( Bringing different elements )\nUpgrading Spells\n3D Graphics\nGoing Infinite to actually ACTIVATE the Tokens ( Thats really smart )\nUpgrades to general things ( Luck, Power,Money ext. )\nIf you dont use them. DPS Increase for how much you have active! ^_^\nA Devolper that listens to his fans, and Even added ME as a friend. ME.  thats like. amazing.\nValor points system.\n10 Points: 1 Point to where you want\nThe endless amount of levels just shows how much effort he put into thinking ahead.\nFarming even when the games closed.\nAnd more that ive prob forgotten bc its like 1am xD\n\nCONS:\nA bit grindy. T_T\nMY IDLE BUILD WONT ♥♥♥♥ING WORK (Oh whoops wrong area)\nWait, why is there a cons thing? the games almost perfect as it is!\n\nI would reccomend for one. Making gems easier to obtain. not easily grindable. but just so we can get access to some of those effects.\n\nThis is kinda a longball, but Something intresting that would set this game apart. mabye a multiplayer? like 5 people clicking to kill a boss, or a 1v1 to get to stage ___ The fastest. It would really set this game apart, gives new acheivements, and would be really fun\n\nMabye random Item/Artifact Drops? these would add effects, and can be dropped off Reguar mobs on a 0.001% Chance. and 0.01% From a boss ( 0.0001% If boss was killed ) And if you have passed a area you cant grind it for artifacts. only bosses. thats why its so low. Some of these could simpily be like hidden spells. Hiddenstat steriods. who knows, the possblitys are endless\n\nWhat about a literal 1 verses one. where the player has to tap the OTHER player to death before they do, could be 10. 100. 1000. 10000. ( For higher you might wanna add a way to earn gold ) That would add a unique element ( Although auto clickers )\n\nBut apart from that. this is simpily a amazing, and addictive game. i LOVE this game. and the Developer is a great guy as well. i know this is long, but thanks for reading, i hope you play Tap Tap Infinity. Its worth your spare time to check on. its addictive.\n","July 27, 2015","true","22.9"," 44 of 71 people (62%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","62","44","71","10","2"

You gain Ranks by beating waves of monsters.... and after 500 (and then 600...), you can decide to wipe your Rank grogress to advance to the next Rank level, which gives now a higher DPS boost per level!\n4) Most innovative Skill: BossRush!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/380360/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","TL;DR: Grindy but truly casual clicker game for those who want to play while they play.\n\nTap Tap Infinity is a casual idle/clicker game, very similar to a certain other Steam game, Clicker Heroes (CH). Now why would a gamer like me with several thousand games (some of which might actually be good) waste time to play this? For achievements of course.\n\nNow that my lousy motivation is out of the way, let's get dirty with the details. Being a clicker game the gameplay itself isn't very complex. A monster appears on the screen. Clicking it will damage it. Once it gets enough damage it dies and bleeds gold, with which you can buy upgrades and train your heroes to be able to beat higher, more difficult monster waves.\n\nA game with a story\nTap Tap Infinity becomes distinct from other similar games by having a story. It's very basic though. Some monsters have appeared and the world is in danger, so you have to beat them up. A catch is that beating monsters will "bring them to their senses" and then you can hire them to fight for you.\n\nIt's also 3D: what a time to be alive, huh? Models are fine but not exceptional. Some of them looks rather ridiculous but that's likely a personal preference and you really shouldn't make fun of stupid-looking monsters because that might hurt their feelings.\n\nI disliked the sound effects that I found to be too sharp and having too many high notes. Music is fun though, but since its loop is not terribly long, I found myself muting the game 99% of the time.\n\nGrind is real\nTypically in clicker games there's a restart mechanism. This one is no exception: after a while you can go infinite! You'll be doing that a lot, since it gives you Infinity tokens that are used to buy permanent upgrades to e.g. gold farming and damage your heroes and clicks make. They also grant a fixed bonus to your DPS (damage per second).\n\nBut wait, there's more! Killing monsters and beating waves grants you experience, that increases your rank that directly affects all damage you make and also unlocks active skills.\n\nSkills are a bit different from other clicker games on Steam, which is fun. Boss Rush is probably the best of them, allowing you to skip through several hundreds of waves by only killing boss monsters (usually every 5 waves). Since there is no skill to increase the DPS over a single run (no equivalent of Dark Ritual from CH), deep runs are less useful (which is good: I find them boring). But grind is real, so you can also upgrade the skills with Infinity tokens.\n\nFinally, Infinity tokens can be used to Ascend, which resets the rank. Ascension roughly doubles the DPS in the long run.\n\nYour heroes also get kind of experience tokens (i.e. Valor tokens), which are used with the in-game currency, gems, to upgrade the heroes.\n\nThe grind, while not infinite, is still great if you are going for all the achievements.\n\nConvenience is the key\nFortunately one can play Tap Tap Infinity in many ways. Both casual playing of couple of minutes and long sessions are supported. Once you close the game it will progress through the waves until it reaches a spot where it no longer can beat the boss wave.\n\nYou can in effect return once in a while to use the skill combos. Still, it's slightly faster to proceed and you can get farther into the waves when playing actively, since click damage outdoes the idle damage. You could even play hybrid, only succumbing to clicking when it becomes too slow to progress by idling.\n\nGame is generous with idling: you could click one moment and after just a few seconds the idle mode starts again, and of the skills only Clickstorm (which grants a constant, frantic clicking of monsters) breaks the idle mode.\n\nConveniently, there's a direct link to Wiki from the game so the optimizing players find their thing easily.\n\nFinally, while the game doesn't have Steam cloud saves, it does support cloud saving through their own servers. I suppose this makes it compatible with the mobile version as well (also hence the name has Taps instead of Clicks).\n\nFinal countdown\nFor myself it took over 9 months to beat the game achievement-wise, recorded as 350 hours on Steam. I could still struggle to reach the final wave 5000 but I'm good, thank you very much.\n\nA paying player could probably cut a few tens or hundreds of hours out of that, since one of the achievements directly depends on the in-game purchasable gems. Thankfully, even a non-paying player can grind them out and even succeed before doing the last of the super-grindy ascension cheevos.\n\nIt's not a terribly good game, but it's not bad either. I would recommend Tap Tap Infinity for a busy person who doesn't have that much time for gaming but who also likes to hunt achievements. It's also nice to play a few minutes between more occupying games since it doesn't require too much dedication.","March 31","true","349.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

My biggest problem with Clicker Heroes was that it took so much longer to get to Dread Knights than everything that came before them. I felt the curve there was unfair. I also didn't like how you had to choose between Ancients, and if you happened to get four you didn't want to choose from, then tough luck. Gilding heroes in Clicker Heroes is also random - it's possible to get a useless hero upgraded, and then you have to expend resources to fix it.\n\nTap Tap Infinity is very similar to Clicker Heroes, except it fixes those aspects of the game. There are 21 heroes to hire and upgrade, and they're all available very quickly. There are 4 Guardians with 4 skills each, and you always have access to all of them as long as you have enough infinity tokens to pay for the next level. There's even some semblance of a plot, to explain why the level design loops every 100 levels, and why the heroes are willing to fight for you. You can also upgrade your spells, which I don't remember whether you could in Clicker Heroes - I got too frustrated with the progression curve in that game to keep up with it. And when it comes to upgrading your heroes, you get to choose which ones to upgrade when.\n\nBasically, this game is Clicker Heroes but trimmed down to exclude some of the fat, and improve on some of the weak points. It's streamlined. And it has 3d graphics. If you're looking for an idle game to pop in on when you have some time to kill, this is a good option.","April 26","true","203.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Allow me to set things straight.\n\nI want to clear up one thing up first though:\nYes, the game IS very similar to Clicker Heroes.  But in my opinion, it's an improvement to the formula that CH was composed of.\n\n\n\nMystery Gifts\nClicker Heroes has these little objects that randomly pop up on the screen that always gives you gold and occasionally a ruby.  In TTI these mystery gifts randomly pop up after you defeat an enemy, but they don't always give you gold.  They may give you gold,  or they could give you infinity tokens or valor points instead.\n\nInfinity Tokens\nThey ARE almost identical to Hero Souls.  You can only obtain them the very first time you clear a boss stage on a run, and they act as a currency that doubles as 10% dps per IT.  However you get them much earlier (I think stage 30 is the earliest), and after you've discovered them, you may find them in mystery boxes as well.\n\nUpgrades\nFor the most part, they are the same... except (and this wins me over), YOU HAVE ALL OF THEM UNLOCKED.  There is no accepting whatever is available to you, or spending hero souls hoping for better options.\n\nValor Points\nI suppose you could look at them as Infinity Tokens that only work for specific heroes.  If you must compare to clicker heroes, then it's a form of gilding for a hero, and after you collect so many for a specific hero you may upgrade the hero so that their skills and dps are higher.  (edit:  Finally found enough VP to start upgrading some of my heroes.  Apparently each upgrade after the first costs Gems as well as VP)\n\nInfinity Gems\nTook me a while to find one of these.  The premium currency, though like CH Rubies, you can find these during normal gameplay.  Though these are found through "super-boss" rare drops instead of the mystery gifts (or perhaps "as well as" but not for sure)","July 21, 2015","true","30.8"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","1"

From the looks of it, the Steam version is a pretty nice port.\n\nFirst review written for me - normally I don't do this, but I saw something that needed addressing.  Many of the negative reviews of this game state that it's a copy of clicker heroes.  Ironically, I thought the very same thing when I started playing it; the number of similarities is startling at first.  However, I'd recommend delving a bit further into the game before making a final judgement; there's quite a few differences.\n\nI'm also a former clicker heroes player, but ultimately abandoned the game due to lack of developer presence.  This developer is extremely fast to respond, engages the community on a daily basis, and regularly updates the game.\n\nAs far as actual mechanics, here's a few things that make this my preferred idle/clicker game:\nAn overall rank (kind of like experience levels) that give you more DPS per rank.  You can also improve the effects of each rank through a resetting mechanism.\nExtremely convenient buying options, like "buy max" in 25-level increments.\nGrid mode, so I can manipulate everything on one screen.\nLittle tidbits of story as you progress.","July 17, 2015","true","0.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Fragsworth actually defended this game on Reddit when someone called it a clone. The differences become more apparent the longer you play, so give the game a chance if you are into the clicker/incremental genres. The Spells, Guardian powers, currencies etc. all function differently here than in Clicker Heroes and there are other unique features as well, with more constantly being added.\n\nI've played the game since December on the web version and am currently on my second playthrough (reached the final level and hard reset in June). I even had the privilege to be made a boss in the game because of my contributions to the game's wiki. As I see it, TTI has numerous advantages over Clicker Heroes et al.:\n\nFirst, the dev is amazing. He is reliable, reasonable and constantly interacts with the community to collect suggestions and feedback. Even if he rejects your idea, he'll explain why and is open to further discussion. Several of my suggestions have made it into the game and it's obvious he really values players' feedback, including often asking our opinions before implementing major updates, preventing some of the total update catastrophes that blight other games in the genre. He'll also help you swiftly if you lost your save or are experiencing bugs. Notably, he's even been interacting with the playerbase while he's on vacation! In short, he cares about the playerbase a lot.\nVery frequent updates, and in particular a very swift turnaround on bug fixes and other things players are complaining about. He's always sharing what he's planning next and how the update is going so that it's not frustrating to wait.\nIn terms of the game design, Scarybee has worked really hard to make the game more convenient to play and I think this game is in the forefront of the genre for Quality of Life features, such as grid mode, round levelling to multiples of 25, and things like this which make the routine of playing the game a lot less frustrating.\nAs for pacing, balancing and things like that, I find this game overall a lot more consistent, intuitive and less frustrating than other games in the genre. You don't unlock things in a random order according to RNG, which can screw you over if you're unlucky; it's very hard to screw yourself over permanently by upgrading the wrong things, so there's no pressure to follow a strict guide for everything - go your own way! The pace is well-balanced, with very few walls, and even the walls that do exist are easily overcome with the right investments; the game is a lot more flexible in terms of strategy, unlike some games in the genre where you're pretty much forced to play one or two ways in order to make any progress. I feel therefore this game is a lot more accessible and less rigid than others in the genre.\nHowever, there is a great deal of depth as well, particularly in stuff like the VP Upgrades, spell strategies and Ascension (which is a way of resetting rank to get more DPS, it's not like ascending in Clicker Heroes, which is called 'going infinite' here), so the game can appeal to casual players and min-maxers alike.\nWhile there is a currency that can be bought with real money, it's also easily obtainable by F2P players as well (there are many guaranteed drops of Gems throughout the game) and it's not at all necessary to buy Gems to complete the game. You're not constantly bugged to buy Gems or anything, it's actually very easy to forget you can buy Gems with real money at all. You won't be crippled by being F2P because Scarybee cares about F2P players just as much as paying ones.\nOn that note, you also don't need to use an autoclicker or tap a ridiculous amount to progress in this game. The skills Conquest and Banking will give you big DPS and gold bonuses for idling, and with the Spell Monstrous Strength you'll be able to tap without breaking idle mode, which is excellent for Boss Rush (a spell where you skip all normal levels, only fighting bosses, which is really cool.) While Scarybee doesn't care if you use autoclickers, so you won't be penalised for using one (although it's not as beneficial as in other games like Realm Grinder, unless you use the autoclicker to level Heroes for you), he also hasn't scaled the game for autoclicker-users, which means people who choose not to use one won't be screwed over either. I think this is a really healthy balance which makes the game rewarding for everyone no matter the way you choose to play.\nLong after I gave up on CH and Adcap, I'm still here playing TTI and I am really excited to see how the game continues to develop. If you're into the genre or interested in getting into the genre, give this game a chance!","July 20, 2015","true","2.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I'm actually amazed at how balanced this game is. It's free to play and it's not really the case of whoever has the most money IRL wins. That's not how it works. If you do actually decide to spend some real cash on it - the impact in-game won't be too significant.\n\nAccording to the developer it seems that he has found a way to prevent people from "cheating". He doesn't want people with autoclickers to "win the game/progress in-game quicker" than those who are playing fairly. I can see why - there are in-game bonuses that you can buy which increase your gold/dps by a percentage while you're idle (afk).\n\nTL;DR - a developer who actually cares, this guy is single-handedly updating the game very often, whereas games such as Adventure Capitalist take months to receive any update(s). This is definitely a game to try, after all - it is free to play.","July 23, 2015","true","17.3"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

You click on monsters to gain gold, which you can buy upgrades with. There is also a small chance of Infinity Tokens being dropped by monsters. Infinity Tokens gets you better upgrades but are gained by ascending the world. Tap Tap Infinity gets boring, repetitive after ascensions though. It is very much just a Clicker Heroes but 3D and isn't fun in my opinion","July 24, 2015","false","4.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It didn't gave me a good impression from the start of the game and the interface are horrible. It can be fun at first but the more you click, the more boring it gets. The game itself is not original as Click Heroes have bosses in every 5 levels and this game have the same concept. Well, every cloud has its sliver lining. It's free and easy to get achievement for the achievement hunters. I'm glad that I did not pay for this because I don't enjoy this kind of rip-off game.","July 30, 2015","false","0.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

I just wish there would be more clickers that just do things diferently like Time Clickers and took this and molded it with another genre and see how well it would go i would play it so long as its different, just this one isnt still play it its free and you have no reason not to its just the same as any other.","August 5, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was also completely wrong in a lot of aspects too.\nSo, I'm rewriting this review from scratch to give a more honest review after I settled down (Did some Yoga) and realized it's not NEARLY as bad as I rambled on about.\n\nStarting off with the elephant in the room. YES, it's similar to Clicker Heroes. But that's not bad, Clicker Heroes is good, and this is good too, what's the problem?\n\nNext, the graphics. Of course, it's not NEXTGENULTRAREALISTICGTA6 graphics, but it's not "PS2 ERA ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T" as I described. It's pretty nice, honestly. The 3D effect and the very smooth animations give the enemies a lot of personality and charm.\nThe monsters themselves are pretty good looking also! Sure, their names aren't exactly creative, but Pokemon has crabs named Krabby and snakes named Kobra, right? Also, I don't really want every monster to be named "Smarfity the 8th" or "Cremblimboes" or something stupid. Honestly, it works.\n\nThe UI is pretty decent. Simple, but very intuitive and functional. The font is very nice also! It has a lot of great features.\n\nSome features have been added and changed from Clicker heroes which I like. There are also some very nice touches that I love! For instance, there's an option that lets the camera *very slightly* tilt around where you move your mouse. Very nice touch!\n\nAll in all, it's becoming a genre of games, these "Clicker" games. If you like Clicker Heroes, you'll like this.\n\n(Shoutout to the developers for being very calm and nice about my previous poorly written review!)","July 20, 2015","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","15"

If you enjoy that, you'll enjoy this.\n\nThe only real difference is how the "Ascension" feature is handled. There isn't a random draw on this games form of "Ancients". It's more of a tree-based formula where you unlock things in each of the God's skillsets. But even the skills are essentially the same as those seen in the "Ancients" in Clicker Heroes.\n\nThe other noticeable change is that you unlok each new Hero to hire by defeating them. They take the place of the bosses in this game and you can then purchase them.\n\nAll in all though the skills, abilities, and flow of the game overall is the same. I have yet to really hit a wall ala the Level 140 wall in Clicker Heroes, but I've also not actively played it very much. I like the look of it a bit more as well. It basically looks like what you think a baby between World of Warcraft and Clicker Heroes would look like.","July 23, 2015","true","293.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

(which you can do too of course)\n\nit has a lot of options to tweak your gains, or strengths and "drop" chances.. which make you lose 10% DPS for each token, but that's the thing that makes the start over more worth it.. also you can start over soon as you gained 1 Token, no upgraded ability needed .. you can decide whether to then restared with a lot of boosted damage right away, and spend Tokens later on (they drop from lvl 30 on) to boost the gameplay itself.. or first just grind your way on to higher areas wich then give you more chances for income.. you don't have to spend them all at once so that you can balance the remaining "raw" DPS boost\n\nI won't even go on for now .. but if you want to play a clicker game which is not just "tactical" this one beats Clicker Heroes I'd say.. and.. seems more "bland" than Time Clickers maybe.. (which has aiming and interesting Gun Mods) .. but   it seemingly progresses the fastest\n\nstill: whether you're an 80s Baby or not.. the Hymn of all these games might as well be: "We're on a road to nowhere" ...","August 17, 2015","true","104.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you love idle games then this is a great game. It looks great, it's very well balanced, it doesn't rely heavily on random things happening to be able to progress. One huge thing that stands out for me is the ability to save to the cloud across all versions of the game, no matter what device you are on.\n\nThe dev is one of the best game devs I've ever spoke too, he's always active on the web version of the game talking to players in the chat, he is also very active on the TTI subreddit, he truly listens to player feedback and acts on it if he agrees very quickly. As well as the subreddit there is a wiki that is kept up to date with all the latest information, including a beginners guide for new players, both the subreddit and wiki conveniently have buttons in-game to take you directly to them.\n\nIf you love idle games then give this one a try, to me it is one of the best available with no paywall or unlucky RNG rolls that will stop your progress.","July 17, 2015","true","4.7"," 20 of 42 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","20","42","3","0"

A game which is exactly like clicker heroes, save some differences but not enough of them to make me feel like it's something fresh and new, but more like ah, I have done this before, boss at every fifth?, hp instead of timers but the same deal (this is not fresh), and so I played and hoped for something new but no, gold, chests, heroes, hero abilities, % , "spells" and of the few I got is basicly the same as the ones in clicker heroes.\n\nalthough the graphics are in 3d and the bosses are your future heroes, with including text boxes everywhere trying to create a story by making you clicking to get the story to move on (which halts gameplay), ofc it's all according to your taste. I choose CH because that's the one I begun with, and I hate the blantant ripping I have seen in TTI I must admit. someone should just come up with a new formula instead.","July 22, 2015","false","6.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

You click "a cookie" to earn "cookies" to help buy other things that will help you make more "cookies" faster. However in this case, you click RPG style enemies to attack them, earn currency and use this currency to enslave (or as the game puts it, hire) the bosses that you murder and spend more money on leveling up those slaves and making them more efficient at killing future slaves. You can even go back and kill the bosses you've already enslaved! Trust me, it's actually really simple.\n\nThe art style is very cartoon-like and it is technically 3D. The enemy models are simple, but they still look really nice and slick. The game runs smoothly, without any frame drops and all the animations are also smooth and well made.\n\nIf you liked cookie clicker, and like RPG's you will LOVE this game.\nEven if you don't like cookie clicker, give this game a shot, because it's free and takes 30 seconds to download.

Yes, there are things in common with Clicker Heroes, but, guess what, a LARGE portion of Clicker Heroes was based on Cookie Clicker.  That's how games work.  Tap Tap Infinity, despite not having the best name ever, is an improvement on Clicker Heroes in many ways.  The main thing that is better in CH is that you can look at the ancient (guardians here) list while the game is running.  Also, in TTI you may hit a point where a paid currency is required to advance in one aspect, but I've not hit that yet.  I personally prefer the enemies in CH, but that's a soley a stylistic choice.  On the other hand, In TTI, you can actually advance, including clearing bosses, and receiving their respective loot, while offline.  The gifts are more powerful and varied here, but, because of this they are less common and you have to actually notice them.  There are quite a few mechanics, spells, and ancients different.  The rank system is solely TTI (YOU level up, as well as your heroes).  Graphics are better (obviously).  The grid display is a VAST improvement.\n\nTL;DR  If you think they're the same game, you've not played much of either.  If you like the genre, you'll VERY likely like TTI.  It's an actual step forward from CH, IMO, unlike all the other recent ones that feel more like side-steps.","July 22, 2015","true","74.9"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

It does, however, have in its favour a slightly increased difficulty factor, as you have a TIME LIMIT in which to click the bosses to death, but...seeing since Clicker Heroes had absolutely NO "difficulty" factor to speak of, this wasn't exactly a hard thing for the devs to improve upon.  It is, however, enough to make both "games" about equal in my eyes, so I'm officially bestowing this with the exact same rating out of 10 which I gave Clicker Heroes.\n\nWhen all is said and done, though, this is little more than a means to waste extravagant amounts of your time, and guarantees that you're GONNA need a girlfriend once you're done with it.  Which clearly makes this a lose-lose situation, as you're probably not gonna meet any girls playing this piece-of-♥♥♥♥♥ game anyway.  Save your wrists, and your time, and your LIFE, and DON'T try this game, even though it's free.  Unless you already have a girlfriend.  In which case, feel free to click away to your heart's content.  Just as long as you're prepared to LOSE said girlfriend, and all your OTHER friends, and maybe your FAMILY as well.  This game is a bottomless pit, filled with misery and nothingness.  The music is kinda "cute", though.\n\nVerdict: 6.5/10.","July 17, 2015","true","1.3"," 8 of 27 people (30%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","30","8","27","8","9"

Earn gold. Spend that gold on upgrades to your click damage. Purchase automatic damage over time, and upgrade that. Unlock special skills and use them to defeat enemies faster, or earn more gold per kill, and invest that gold into more upgrades so you can kill faster and get more gold to invest so you can kill faster and get more gold to invest so you can kill faster and get more gold to invest so you can kill faster and get more gold to invest so you can kill faster and get more gold to invest so you can kill faster and get more gold to invest...\n\nYep. It's one of these types of games. There's a prestige system that gives you a special currency that you can use to purchase various powerups that do a lot of things, such as decreasing skill cooldowns, increase gold dropped, increase dps.\n\nTo many people, this type of game seems boring. To those people, I'd suggest peeking at a few games like this to see what the appeal is. It's basically a distillation of most game genres that have some form of upgrade system, such as obtaining better gear or gaining levels and powerful perks.\n\nPersonally, I like these types of games. They satisfy that reward center in the brain. It's a perfect example of the Skinner Box.","December 10, 2015","true","535.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's an idling game.\nYou buy things and upgrade things in order to buy better things and better upgrades. There really isn't anything deeper than that. It's the kind of thing I play while rewatching stuff on netflix, or listening to music and podcasts. I tend to multitask online, not a good thing while listening to podcasts. Reading something and listening to people talk, and trying to pay equal attention to both... well, it doesn't work. And that's why I like this type of game. It's a fun thing to focus on.\n\nI played Clicker Heroes first. I was excited to see this kind of game on Steam and it was much better than the browser based ones. Then when checking free games I saw they were adding even more! That was awesome!\nSo I started Tap Tap Infinity and instantly liked it more. The graphics, designs, menus.\nI have 3 hours on Clicker Heroes, and over 100 on this. I can't really see either as being bad, but I prefered Tap Tap Infinity. It's not the type of genre where you should fully play through every game. You click things to get money to buy things to get more money to buy better things to make even more money to buy even... Well hopefully you see how the pattern goes.\n\nI like Tap Tap Infinity. I like that these types of things are on Steam now. It gives me the added bonus of getting achievements. This definitely isn't a genre for everyone though. If it is, just find a game you like and stick with it. Have it as something on the background.

It ran through quite a few upgrades since the time I started the game including the addition of Soul Links, which was very helpful.\n\nThe cash shop in the game is very fair and not required at all (outside of wanting to support the developer) for idling in this game - though it definitely speeds up your playthrough.  For those who are trying to complete all the achievements, a few of them are tedious and require micro managing the idle game (namely the 3,000 gifts clicked on achievement) which is why the game took as long as it did for me to complete fully (this and my inefficient use of spells as well).\n\nFeaturing 5,000 levels with many repeating sprites that steadily grow bigger, there are a few one time only boss monsters that are a bit satisfying to clear.  Plenty of ways to upgrade and branch out though the priorities are pretty straightforward now with the inclusion of Soul Links, which should always be aimed for first in order to gain more Soul Gems (the paid for currency) to speed up things.\n\nOn a platform where more and more options out there now that the genre is increasingly becoming more saturating... it's a solid idle game that can stand up on it's own.","November 27, 2015","true","522.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My "Ars Poetica" is, the games are can be art and must be. So I looking into this way all the time when I start play someting.\n\nFirst of all, all clicker games come to an endless ... thing, even here where the charachters tell us: the game will never ends. It was the first place where finally somebody says why is that kind of gaming are born to be dead. But I like and respect it. So yeah a little story, but we will carry it trough infinity times. Thats great, but I think this endless can have deeper meaning.\n\nNow saying about the most reapeted word: endless.\nClickers are the most simply way to feel the unworthiness. You see numbers gathering and do the same routing every moment, just like working the most boring factory job. But what the endless can tell us? It is just make us depressed...\nWell, the Time ♥♥♥♥ is the best game who maded this way. It's not a clicker game. The game show the most important parts of infinity and yeah, it's really dark 'n s**t, but have a great story, a good and variable gameplay, better sounds and music what also helps to feel the never ending nightmare.\n\nBut clickers... after the Time ♥♥♥♥, the happines in those games makes me depressed.\n\nTTI have a really childish design what we have here and it is strange: The wolf who have only two leg and the first boss... it a fat ball or what? Every model are came from a child fantasy and drawed into this game. It's awesome if play some adventure or something else who are can be made of children. Also: There minions what just like one of the bosses just with another name and smaller.\n\nJust think about it: if you were a parent, you really want to see your child playing tapping games with are neverending and always same gameplay and you can't really explain to she or he what is happening acttually?\n\nI understand, we all hate bad things, like realize our meaningless human being, but lie never make anything better. The original clicker game style should be dark like the lvl 100 boss. Damm I love she *-*\nI try learn something from this but can't. There is a rainbow what -after a time- start to fade after getting boring by seeing that all days long...\n\nSo, how can be those games like to be? Meaningless or dark as the terror realm.\n\n\nWell, this game is dead to me. I know making a game takes time so I respect every moment what are spended and everything what I wrote means: this game maded by good poeple.\n\nAlso: I have seen comments like: "Just play clicker heroes". CH is the very same, but in 2D instead 3D and have merchaneries, the only thing what save the game. Play that and you will understand what I wrote about meaningless.\n\nI understand the developers needs money, but only stupid buy boost in a "free game" and this way the game just help spread the stupidity trough the world.\n\nLast of all, it's a nice game, what are need some improvments, but still just a clicker game now in 3D.\nThe most lovely thing is here the main permamently payment -the infinity tokens- are spawned much more sooner than the other clicker games.\nI miss more realistic charachters, bigger storyline and full 3D camera veiw. Rotating arounds the camera should be awesome :D or I just wanted to see, where did the legs go. xd\nSo, it can be an epic story based on clicking same things and teach us, what time means to us and we will learn about life and respect, or just be as meaningless like the clicker heroes and don't care about it.\n\n\n\n- When I finished Time ♥♥♥♥ - part two after years, I was in stasis... I have seeing myself an idiot for everything I didn't do. I went to my mom and tell him "I love you very much" when I went to she in cementry, the I went home to my grandma and I helped she around the house suprising and makes she happy.\nMaybe I just overreacted those clickers... I do... I have feeled what are lost now. Hope not forever.","January 12","false","22.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Kill things, level up, unlock people to fight for you, eventually reset the whole thing and start over endlessly.  Upgrades are there, but like all of these idle games they're either going to take you weeks to get anywhere significant, or you're going to end up paying for them. I can't even call this a "pay to win" model because you never actually win. The game goes on forever.  So this and most other idle games become a test of your patience.  Are you willing to wait several hours or several days for that next tantalizing upgrade, or will the game convince you to spend your hard-earned cash?\n\nI suppose it's good enough to kill a random few minutes here and there, so long as you don't get too invested in it.  That said, there's really not much in the way of gameplay.  You click things. You're never in any danger and there's no real risk. You just sit there and click things.

Earn gold. Spend that gold on upgrades to your click damage. Purchase automatic damage over time, and upgrade that. Unlock special skills and use them to defeat enemies faster, or earn more gold per kill, and invest that gold into more upgrades so you can kill faster and get more gold to invest so you can kill faster and get more gold to invest so you can kill faster and get more gold to invest so you can kill faster and get more gold to invest so you can kill faster and get more gold to invest so you can kill faster and get more gold to invest...\n\nYep. It's one of these types of games. There's a prestige system that gives you a special currency that you can use to purchase various powerups that do a lot of things, such as decreasing skill cooldowns, increase gold dropped, increase dps.\n\nTo many people, this type of game seems boring. To those people, I'd suggest peeking at a few games like this to see what the appeal is. It's basically a distillation of most game genres that have some form of upgrade system, such as obtaining better gear or gaining levels and powerful perks.\n\nPersonally, I like these types of games. They satisfy that reward center in the brain. It's a perfect example of the Skinner Box.","December 10, 2015","true","535.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My "Ars Poetica" is, the games are can be art and must be. So I looking into this way all the time when I start play someting.\n\nFirst of all, all clicker games come to an endless ... thing, even here where the charachters tell us: the game will never ends. It was the first place where finally somebody says why is that kind of gaming are born to be dead. But I like and respect it. So yeah a little story, but we will carry it trough infinity times. Thats great, but I think this endless can have deeper meaning.\n\nNow saying about the most reapeted word: endless.\nClickers are the most simply way to feel the unworthiness. You see numbers gathering and do the same routing every moment, just like working the most boring factory job. But what the endless can tell us? It is just make us depressed...\nWell, the Time ♥♥♥♥ is the best game who maded this way. It's not a clicker game. The game show the most important parts of infinity and yeah, it's really dark 'n s**t, but have a great story, a good and variable gameplay, better sounds and music what also helps to feel the never ending nightmare.\n\nBut clickers... after the Time ♥♥♥♥, the happines in those games makes me depressed.\n\nTTI have a really childish design what we have here and it is strange: The wolf who have only two leg and the first boss... it a fat ball or what? Every model are came from a child fantasy and drawed into this game. It's awesome if play some adventure or something else who are can be made of children. Also: There minions what just like one of the bosses just with another name and smaller.\n\nJust think about it: if you were a parent, you really want to see your child playing tapping games with are neverending and always same gameplay and you can't really explain to she or he what is happening acttually?\n\nI understand, we all hate bad things, like realize our meaningless human being, but lie never make anything better. The original clicker game style should be dark like the lvl 100 boss. Damm I love she *-*\nI try learn something from this but can't. There is a rainbow what -after a time- start to fade after getting boring by seeing that all days long...\n\nSo, how can be those games like to be? Meaningless or dark as the terror realm.\n\n\nWell, this game is dead to me. I know making a game takes time so I respect every moment what are spended and everything what I wrote means: this game maded by good poeple.\n\nAlso: I have seen comments like: "Just play clicker heroes". CH is the very same, but in 2D instead 3D and have merchaneries, the only thing what save the game. Play that and you will understand what I wrote about meaningless.\n\nI understand the developers needs money, but only stupid buy boost in a "free game" and this way the game just help spread the stupidity trough the world.\n\nLast of all, it's a nice game, what are need some improvments, but still just a clicker game now in 3D.\nThe most lovely thing is here the main permamently payment -the infinity tokens- are spawned much more sooner than the other clicker games.\nI miss more realistic charachters, bigger storyline and full 3D camera veiw. Rotating arounds the camera should be awesome :D or I just wanted to see, where did the legs go. xd\nSo, it can be an epic story based on clicking same things and teach us, what time means to us and we will learn about life and respect, or just be as meaningless like the clicker heroes and don't care about it.\n\n\n\n- When I finished Time ♥♥♥♥ - part two after years, I was in stasis... I have seeing myself an idiot for everything I didn't do. I went to my mom and tell him "I love you very much" when I went to she in cementry, the I went home to my grandma and I helped she around the house suprising and makes she happy.\nMaybe I just overreacted those clickers... I do... I have feeled what are lost now. Hope not forever.","January 12","false","22.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
