It's not that easy as a kid but if you actually know what you are doing it's not that hard. The story isn't the best but it's not that bad either.\n\nThere are 6 races, with 5 of them you can trade and build space stations in their systems. The beginning can be a bit slow but as soon as you have yor own station, which you can get after about an hour if you sell the shield you get, it gets quite easy. There are some stations which are just flat out better than others but you can either figure that out yourself or just google it. If you want to explore a bit you can, just fly wherever you want, leave some money in you stations and some transporters and when you come back you will have more money then you left.\n\nSome tips you should listen to:\nget the S.E.T.A upgrade  it makes the game much more enjoyable.\nand get the docking computer from the paranids.\n\nif you have questions just leave them here i'll respond to them.\n\n","September 30, 2014","true","48.0"," 170 of 192 people (89%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","89","170","192","13","10"

Once you get into the game though it becomes more interesting as you can set up your own production plants and start getting into the finer aspects of trading. If you like trading games this is a good one to get as there is a lot of product to play around with. The combat system is a bit lacking as it's hard to destroy enemies with lasers in the beginning and the enemy AI gets really suicidal taking you with them as they crash into you. Still aside from the occasional nonsense the game itself is unique and can be very fun if your willing to learn how to play the game.","January 21, 2014","true","78.1"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","31","35","0","0"

But more better and simplier. The only thing is if you got games like X2 and X3 then you may not adapt to the controls and how to manage those open-ended games. Start with this game and try it! If you get stuck or think you need more cash in-game, look into the Egosoft site. And use the HEX editor tool in your x-btf saves. Read more info in Egosoft or the Cheat sites.\n\nThe only thing that this game got, compared to the newer X-Series games is the afterburner turbo boost and the SETA Boost Extension that isn't featured in the newer series. I have to warn you if you play X2 The Threat onwards you maybe lost on how to interact, trade and fight -- as it is a steep learning curve. So start with X - Beyond the Frontier and maybe have a glance on my guides and video tutorials if you are interested.","August 8, 2012","true","41.9"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","30","38","0","0"

Some things are sorely missing, such as the ability to change ships but the core of the game back then was much the same.\n\nWhile the technology has gone leaps and bounds since this game was released, the quality of the graphics has exploded and features that were unthinkable back in those days have been added the core of the game, the essence of what an X game is, remains much the same to this day.\n\nYou are a pilot on a experimental spaceship in a universe, as the game starts events unfold that leave you stranded in alien space with no way home. And that's about all the direction you will get from this game. There is a plot hiding somewhere and occasionally you will come across bits and pieces of it but following it is entirely optional and most players will probably choose to ignore it for the majority of the game.\n\nThe core of the game is, quite simply, trading, fighting and exploring. You travel around the universe finding new systems, new enemies and new trade hubs. As you increase in notoriety and your financial means increase you gain access to new weapons and equipment for your ship and new avenues open up for you.\n\nThe learning curve is steep enough to make even the most doped up Tour de France rider think twice before attempting the climb. The game explains only the very basics to you, everything else you have to figure out for yourself. This is something that makes Beyond The Frontier, and in fact all X games, something of a challenge to get into. The game is extremely unforgiving to newcomers and unless you have the patience to restart a few times this probably isn't the game for you.\n\nDespite it's age Beyond The Frontier is still a good game with some good solid core gameplay. It is also a game with it's share of faults the most prominent being the lack alternate starting points and the inability to change ships in game something which makes starting a new game rather cumbersome, even for an experienced player. The similarities between this and later incarnations is of course also a detriment to buying it nowadays because you will get much the same game if your purchase the latest installment in the series, only it will be an improved game.","January 15, 2013","true","182.9"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roastbroast/recommended/2840/","roastbroast","Mantaloupe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roastbroast/","124 products in account","It's a great game, but it unfortunately suffers from a couple of problems, some major and some minor.\n\nThe tutorial isn't really all that helpful, it gives you an idea of what you're doing--it lets you get comfortable with the X-Shuttle itself, but what you're supposed to do is not really elaborated on.\n\nThe trading system is good, but I feel like it would be better if you were able to walk around these production centers and stuff (Although, you can do some EVA in X Tension). The music is good at setting an atmosphere, it gives you a feeling that you really are flying through space--not some high-intensity, strings-heavy Hans Zimmer ♥♥♥♥, of course, the music is well-situated when you get into a fight, but even the fighting has its own problems.\n\nThe enemy AI is awful, it's just awful. I would find more challenge if the game had them fire back or at least tail you closely, but instead they turn into giant Kamikaze-units and try to ram into you, leading to cheap deaths. You usually have to try to take them out in one pass or just make sure you're ALWAYS behind them, or approaching them in a way where they can't turn and fly into you.\n\nThe graphics are really a mixed bag. The use of low lighting and lens flare make it feel like a science-fiction title, with stars' blaring light casting through your ship. Planets are also well-drawn. But the ships and centers look very...well...I would say "1990's" if this game wasn't developed in 1999. The graphics are bland, a lot of grays, greens and reds when more life could be put in.\n\nShip control is great! The ship handles pretty well. There isn't too much to be said since it flies wrather swell.\n\nAs an overall verdict, the game is...decent. The ship control is good, and background graphics are good, I love the trading system and it's fun to become anything from a supply merchant, to a drug supplier, to a bounty hunter and, when you amass enough credits, entrepeneur. The game is hampered by poor enemy AI and bland graphics with ships and stations in space. But, overall, I'd recommend it.","February 13, 2014","true","10.5"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

I am enjoying it so far. Hopefully the rest of the series will be as appealing to me.  It's worth trying if you like space trading games, and the X super box ever goes on sale or is bundled again.\n\nTip: there is a brief text file in the game directory you should look at first before starting. It will tell you exactly what you need to do to get going. e.g trade solar cells and buy a SETA so you can move fast right away. If you don't know that you may spoend more than 15 minutes moving at a snails pace and that wouldn't be fun. Definitely do 1 trade, then next immediately grab a SETA and keep going from there.","March 10, 2015","true","14.0"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","18","28","0","0"

This game is one of the best I've ever played, easily outperforming 3000 AD's "Universal Combat" or Lucas Art's "Jedi Starfighter." If you're a fan of Firefly, Battlestar, Star Wars, Star Trek, O Game, or maybe even Star Gate, this game undoubtedly hosts at least moderate appeal for you. A sandbox in the purest sense, X gives you nigh unlimited freedom to explore and plunder as you see fit. Reap the profits of interstellar commercial trade or engage in illegal smuggling runs as a roguish pirate. Explore the unknown reaches of space, or just go in phasers blasting and face the consequences. Whether you play as a profiteer, a noble explorer, or a lone ranger, X strikes the perfect balance between free form gameplay and fun. I've just begun building my trade empire and I can't wait to see what lies in store for me. For a game that came out in 1999, the visuals are gorgeous. Vast, intricate, colorful nebulas set in the backdrop of open, black space instill a feeling of mystery and invite an air of wonder. Gargantuan space stations whirl slowly in fixed orbits of the monstrous planets they call home. Warp gates lie dormant at the edges of their respective sectors, occasionaly springing to life with the passage of ships.

I'd like to say I put about 40 hours into this game, 40 hours that I will never get back. The only other open-world space sim I've played was Freelancer back in high school and that game was a hundred times better than X: Beyond the Frontier. Let me tell you exactly what this game has in store for gamers:\n\nStart off with almost nothing with no instructions on what to do next. Search the internet for guides and find only a couple. Fly back and forth between space stations buying x number of items to sell to another station for x amount of credits. Repeat this process about 200 times until you can eventually buy whatever stations you want to take the stupid dock-and-trade chore out of the game while they make money for you. Once you've gotten to this point in the game prepare to be further dissapointed. The rest of the game consists of flying back and forth across the universe for hours, finding specific objects and only once in a while participating in some very bland, uninspiring, and unrewarding dogfights against the simplest and easiest AI.\n\nI know this game came out in 1999 but it's seriously bad. I wish I could get those wasted hours back. Never have I played a game where after beating it I feel like it was all a chore with no rewards.","July 29, 2015","false","3.3"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","2","8","0","0"

The combination of music, visuals, slow pace and attention to detail make this for me an almost perfect journey into my fantasy of exploring space.\n\nIt is not for everyone, but if you are on the fence, just listen to the soundtrack. If you like it, you will like the game, the feeling of exploring space is exactly captured in the music. Take your time and dream in space...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Zhpw3jiEtU&list=PLCF623632D0B21AF4","April 18, 2015","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So much fun! Great space trading game. But don't let the trading idea turn you off this game. There is a lot of upgrades and such that you can get for your ship and pirates and other species attack you depending on relations and such. It also has an ever changing economy where some items are in demand in some places than in another. After you get enough credits, you can buy a space station and make more credits or you can buy mining lasers or weapons and become police officers or miners and such. The only thing I can say that's bad about this game is that the graphics are quite dated but nevertheless, still an awesome game! Well worth the money.","March 16, 2015","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I LOVE the trading system. While the game does have a storyline, you don't have to follow it. The tutorial could be better on the trading and combat side, but it does a good job of showing you the flight systems.\n\nCons: the combat A.I. is more than a little bad. They have a tendency to just ram you. This was fixed in the later games. You can only pilot the X-perimental shuttle, however in all of the later games you can fly every single ship (yes this includes the huge capital ships, but only in the later games). Also, when you start, you have 100 credits and NOTHING ELSE! no weapons, shields, S.E.T.A. (faster flight time system), nothing other that 100 credits and a ship.\n\n\nOverall, I cannot reccommend this game enough, especially if you plan on buying the other games, this one really helps to lesson the learning curve.","April 16, 2015","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But the sense of being lost in a strange universe having to struggle for everything makes everything you do seem a massive accomplishment.\n\nIn this game you are a test pilot who while testing an experimetal drive ends up lost in space, literally you have no clue where you could be or what is going on, oh and to top it off your weapons are fried, and you have no way to return. This means you have to figure everything out for yourself and somehow get some guns. And of course the lack of tutorial or manual adds to the sense of being lost in a strange universe.\n\nIf you are easily frustrated or like everything handed to you on a platter, this game is not for you.","July 3, 2011","true","58.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
