This suffers from pretty much all the problems that have been plaguing RPG Maker games for the last 15+ years. This game in particular suffers from:\n\nExcessive use of generic assets, which look and sound generic. In this game's case, the MAIN CHARACTER uses a generic and non-fitting sprite. Most other characters use either generic RPG Maker profile images, ripped photographs of Valve staff, and rips of 3D assets. Monster graphics are the same. There are very few efforts at hand-drawn assets (allegedly) made for this game.\nRandom encounters are stock RPG Maker encounters with stat adjustments. Ogres? Bats? Mimics? They make no sense in this context.\nBland dungeons that are just maze, maze, maze.\nOne way map progression where often, you don't even get a reason why you can't go back the way you came. This game is a hallway that connects a few basic mazes.\nDefault RPG Maker encounter rate, which is extremely high. Not since Lufia 1 for SNES have I seen an encounter rate this high.\nA-button battles, though at least so far the "difficulty" hasn't spiked to grind-tastic levels.\nBoss battles are all over the map in terms of difficulty. Most are too underpowered to even stand once you reach them,\nAnd then the final battle is a marathon of defensive moves and endless item use.\nA story that resembles a tiny piece of gum. That piece of gum is a wad of "Valve can't count to three" humor mixed in with recent Illuminati memes. This gum is stretched out so far that's broken by the first dungeon, and doesn't really work anymore.\nMuch of the music does not loop properly. This is how you can figure out which is and isn't RPG Maker music, by the way.\nThe F12 immediately quits to the main menu without warning. To rephrase that with emphasis, the STEAM SCREENSHOT KEY QUITS THE GAME.\nNPC dialogue is bland and NPCs have clearly been copy pasted.\nThe game is about an hour and a half long, which is pretty bad for RPGs in general. I spent a bit more time since I had the game open while updating and writing this review.\nThe game itself is riddled with easily spotted bugs and mistakes, such as the first "major" boss having particle effects that are supposed to descend from the top of the ceiling, but are instead truncated. Shopkeepers change faces while talking to you. Grammar and spelling are a mess. Text goes off the screen or blends with the background. In the GLaDOS room, you can walk on all the scenery, including GLaDOS herself.\nThis is pretty harsh for an indie game review, but back in 2001 I was part of the small RPG Maker community. People poured vast amount of time into games that they couldn't even sell, due to the lack of an official U.S. release at the time. Individuals or teams would come up with custom graphics, sometimes even sound, and would strive to build a compelling story. People would fine tune their games as best as they could. People would script custom battle systems. Cream-of-the-crop games like A Blurred Line, Final Fallacy, and even Phylomortis would enthrall people and motivate others to try and best them.\n\nIf you're going to step out of that free gaming space and into the world of commercial games, you have to step up your game. Just like how Super Meat Boy was a vast improvement over the free Meat Boy, this needs to be a vast improvement over free RPG Maker games -- it needs to be at least at the level of the games I listed.\n\nBut instead, this seems like a cynical cash grab, which is bad for the indie space and further hurts the already tarnished reputation of RPG Maker in general.\n\nSo sorry, but I can't recommend this game.","September 21, 2015","false","2.8"," 886 of 945 people (94%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","94","886","945","40","34"

Heck, even the creator wanted the game to be free2play, yet decided to rip off money from people. I just own it because a friend gifted it to me.\nYou can one/two hit (almost) every enemy in the game, though bosses take a few more hits and are mostly the only enemies you could even consider as some. This results in a linear and mostly boring dungeon-rushing experience. Boss battles are okay I guess, and that's all.\n\nThe story is nonsense, even the game says that in-game. No quality story at all.\n\nThe soundtracks are okay, some songs are even pretty good. But again, all these assets were taken from somewhere and are not originally made for the game itself.\n\nIt's like you're throwing all kind of mixtures into a mixer, blend it and hope to get a good game, instead just the result is a chaotic, non-fitting & cash-grabbing game like this.\n\nTL;DR:\nA game you could play if you're really bored, but even then not worth to buy. Just good for the hilarious meme part of the game: "Omg GabeN, illuminati and HL3!"

It's an RPG Maker game, which isn't a bad thing in and of itself, but this game is a perfect example of a mediocre RPG Maker game that never should have been greenlit in the first place.\n\nAs soon as the game started, warning bells started going off in my head. The intro text is partially cut off, which reeks of inadequate beta testing, and the first area looks horrible. It starts at the Valve office, which would be okay if it didn't look so terrible. After that, there's a generic elemental dungeon which is nothing but tedious and annoying filler. Then there's Aperture Science, which is actually somewhat decent and the best part of the game, but very short. The last area of the game is City 17, or rather a generic urban area that really looks nothing like City 17 or any city at all.\n\nThere's no consistency in visual style at all. The graphics are either completely stock RPG Maker assets or bad Paint jobs. Inexplicably, one character portrait is the former and the other is the latter. All the inventory icons are from the standard icon set, even though they're supposed to be items from Valve's games, and I have no idea why this is the case. The tilesets are RPG Maker DLC, which is fine, but they're badly used, with most areas big, empty, and ugly. Oh, and everything is using a custom font which is almost unreadable.\n\nCustom scripts are used, and to be honest sometimes they work and sometimes they don't. The battle system is a slightly modified version of the stock one, and it's actually pretty good (but the battles themselves aren't- more on that later). It has a great look and feel. On the other hand, the menu system is eye-searingly hideous and basically impossible to use. There are a few other bits and pieces here and there but they mostly contribute without being hugely noticeable one was or the other.\n\nThe gameplay is tedious, incoherent, and unbalanced. There's little in the way of exploration or free-roaming; it's more or less a linear slog through battles with no opportunity to look around. Well, there are the mazes, but you'll be so irritated you won't want to explore. Battles are either laughably easy or atrociously difficult- none strike any sort of satisfying balance. Most of the enemies are completely standard and nothing really fits into the story in a sensible way. Leveling is odd, equipment is odd, skills are odd; it all feels very much thrown together.\n\nIt's ostensibly a parody, but this game fails at that, too. The plot is nonexistent- something something Illuminati and Valve characters make an appearance for no logical reason. There are a few attempts at humour, but for a supposedly funny game it's actually pretty serious most of the time. Most of the jokes are at best dated and at worst never funny to begin with.\n\nI should cover sound design, but I don't really have much to say about it. Take that as a sort of neutral statement. It wasn't bad enough to be memorable or good enough to be memorable.\n\nIt's also really short, at maybe an hour and a half. I'm not sure if that's a curse or a blessing.\n\nDon't buy this game. Supposedly, Gabe Newell signed off on the use of his image, but I have a hard time believing he actually took any more than a cursory glance at this game before doing so. This is a lazy, badly made game that might be okay if it was free but shouldn't have any money spent on it. Or, if the creator had put in some more time and effort, it might actually be worth the $3 I paid for it.","September 25, 2015","false","1.8"," 68 of 79 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","68","79","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PresidentSkele/recommended/403740/","PresidentSkele","Green Skeleton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PresidentSkele/","1181 products in account","Final time according to Steam: 1.5 hours\n\nYou could beat this game and refund it if you wanted to... but why the heck would you even bother playing this in the first place?\n\nMaking a game based around the culture of Valve and Steam could be funny and fertile ground for comedy. You could base factions on real Steam community cliques or make a developer that deletes negative reviews a boss of a dungeon. If handled poorly though, it could come out as an unfunny circlejerk. There are really two ways you can go with this kind of game: You either go for broke and reach for the jugular OR you make something so simpering, so lame as not to offend anyone that you lose your nerve on offering anything truly funny. (Or maybe the third option where you pretend you intentionally made a bad game. I call that the "IT'S JUST A PRANK BRO!" option.)\n\nThe game is the latter of course, with nothing truly biting or satiric to offer the player, combined with poor attempts at maudlin storytelling that feel completely out of place. (Someone shoots themselves in the head... what?)\n\nYou'd think this game would be like Earthbound and you'd be fighting the Steam equivalent of hippies or angry business men - but nope, it's mostly all just out of place ogre's, lamia's and ninjas - straight from the RPG Maker resources themselves. What little humor there is revolves around a few skills or item names that are all so truly unfunny that I forgot I was even alive as a human being they were so ground zero of even inspiring the tiniest of emotions. The game even had the patented "LOL EH WAS A SPY ALL ALONG!" joke that every hack web comic creator has done to death. You'd get more memes out of reading Reddit. You'd get more plot and characterization from a Bazooka Joe comic. You'd get more laughs from a joke book meant for third graders.\n\nThe story revolves around Gaben... something Half Life 3 unreleased lol ecks deeeeeeee. Then you collect three gems that have nothing to do with the plot and then fight GladOS and other Valve trademark characters. Yawn. Snooze.\n\nWhat a tired premise.\n\nSpeaking of tired game design, you know how in RPGs (did I even mention that yet?) you have this thing called... progression? Pacing? You know. You go to a dungeon, fight some monsters for exp/money, meet some new characters that join your party, go to a new town with new items, new twist in the plot, etc\n\nGabeN: The Final Decision doesn't seem to understand the fundamentals, and instead has you go to a town shop where you can buy all the best items for your characters (with no reason to carefully weigh your spending habits) - then you move on, never to return to the shops you were just at. You never have to grind to earn your keep, as you're just given plot convenienced money. You just go from poorly designed dungeon to poorly designed dungeon. RPGs should never feel this linear.\n\nYou also get two - count em - two party members, despite a third slot always teasing another.\n\nOutside of one well designed boss fight, most of them are boring chores, which stems from the fact that your two characters are beyond overpowered (outside of certain special moves being weaker than your vanilla physical attack) and especially as a result of the high encounter rate in the mazes. What's worse is that the incompetent boob that made this game jam packed the dungeons with chests with only 123g in them (yeah, I'm sure that'll come in real handy), but worst of all, he made one of your most common fights Mimic Chests, not through intentional design mind you, but based solely on the amount of chests you'll find in each dungeon. I was so sick of fighting mimics that I don't even know how to express myself at how angry I was at this flat out terrible design. Mimics shouldn't be as common as slimes in Dragon Quest.\n\nIt's beyond the lowest of the low standards set by even the worst RPG Maker games, with dungeons clearly made by the "JUST LIKE CHEATING" randomize dungeon option, because none of them feel intuitive, nor do they have any interesting puzzles to decode. (Seriously. All you do is just flip switches.)\n\nEven to the most die hard of Valve/Steam fanboys, I cannot recommend this to you because even you've probably written more interesting fan fiction... on a napkin... with a broken crayon... the broken crayon is also a french fry.\n\nThe Pro's:\n+One good boss fight\n\n+Trading cards you can sell\n\n+I didn't get cancer somehow\nThe Con's:\n-Too many vanilla RPG Maker resources\n\n-Nonsensical character and item progression\n\n-No real story to get invested in\n\n-Terrible dungeon design\n\n-Far too linear\n\n-The UI can be terrible\n\n-It just ain't funny, kid","October 17, 2015","false","3.2"," 47 of 56 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","47","56","6","0"

And from 4.5 hours on this game, I can easily say that this is an obvious newgrounds game that got streched way too long to justify a money-grabbing price-tag of any monetary value. The issue is that the difficulty curve was not designed, the dev just decided to put a 0 at the end of the default values. This is an amateur RPG maker project that I would make with my friends in a weekend drunk. But to ask 3 USD? I would say, you're delusional. Maybe donate 3 dollars, but not a 3 dollars asking price for admission. The music loops are noticeable, the assets look like they took 2 minutes in paint so the background could get chroma keyed (reminds me of old projects as a kid), and well, it's not a well designed game. But if you like Valve jokes, and jokes about cake, you'll be jolly. Even though Valve hasn't been that compelling of a game company since 2011 when LFD2 came about, then it was Steam and updating games from 5 years past only.\nIf you like beating games, then pay attention to this. When you face the final boss, he just automatically crushes you. You hit a thresh-hold while making sure not to die, because barriers are way too important in this game as they only last one turn, he then just pummels your team to 0% while you have no turn to attack back. This is a joke game on ModDB, not Steam.

It's so bad that it's actually kind of funny.  Is this game really worth your money? Well depends, do you like ludicrous RPG Maker games that are more about jokes than mechanics? If not then no. If so, then yes. The gameplay is simple, use arrow keys to move, enter is your action button and combat functions like a pokemon game in simplistic turn-based fashion. The artwork is pretty much just google images put into the game so you can imagine it's all pretty bad yet mildly humourous. I also cannot stop laughing at the copy/pasted pic of GabeN in this game... so funny. All in all, this game will probably get pulled for copyright reasons but it's good for a few yucks.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/recommended/403740/","drmircow","Dr. Mircow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/","677 products in account","My brain keeps deceiving me as I always tend to read GabeN: The Final DESTINATION. Not DECISION.\n\nGabeN: The Final Decision is simply a game made in RPG Maker as a joke over the weekend. The story is a lot of childish meta gibberish filled with outdated dank memes written with a mentality of a 5-year old who has discovered the Internet just the other day; and yet I believe it makes narratively more sense than a David Cage interactive movie chocking on heroin. But that is like commending this game for something which would be mindboggling. So the story, or the lack of a coherent one (do not worry, even the game warns you), essentially revolves around Gabe Newell, Valve, Illuminati and Gabe’s final decision; yes, how original. Whilst there are a few moments that may make you grin accidently, more so at how bad everything is rather than at any redeemable quality, it miserably fails at any form of comedy. There was potential, but it was all wasted.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly always on rails. Whenever the game attempts to throw a puzzle in, it is generally the most dull and badly implemented fetch quest that you could imagine as the random enemy encounter is also absurdly way too high. But that is okey as the battles, which require no tactics and are devoid of any depth whatsoever, always end up just one-shot killing your generic asset enemies. On the other band, bosses can be stupidly overpowered. There is no pace, consistency, balance nor progression in the entire gameplay as also seen by a majority of items and skills which make no sense statistically, leaving you clueless what to do or use half of the time. The developer furthermore put no effort into the game world as everything is bland, copy-pasted and full of large “empty” rooms. From a design standpoint, everything is utterly lazy.\n\nThen there is the disproportionate use of stock assets from RPG Maker and, presumably, royalty-free websites. But I do also believe half of these assets were "stolen" one way or another. This leads to a lack in personality and feel for the game to at least stand out amongst the rest of the carbon-copy trash games made in RPG Maker on Steam Greenlight. However, the soundtrack can be catchy despite looping poorly at times. Makes you wonder from where the developer “stole” it in the first place.\n\nYou would expect such a rushed game to be riddled with bugs, but surprisingly there are no game-breaking ones. Conversely, there are many things which needed to be ironed out such as when either you or your companion dies, at least do not display the deceased party member as if he is still alive. Also, spelling mistakes are present here and there, and it is a headache figuring out whether they were intentional or not.\n\nIn conclusion, GabeN: The Final Decision is just another by-the-numbers trash RPG Maker game that gives Steam Greenlight a bad reputation, but it is the exact kind of trash that you should only play it once for the novelty experience when you are absolutely drunk or bored and received it as a free gift from someone. Additionally, it is also the kind of trash where you should shoot yourself for even paying a single penny for it. It would have been received a lot less harshly by the community if the developer would not have had the guts to even ask for an overpriced admission fee for this load of junk. It should have been completely free. Period.\n\nI knew from the start that the game was made as a (poor) parody, so I guess the joke is on me for even giving it the slightest bit of attention by writing all this. But hey, got some free time to kill this evening and free trading cards from a free gift.","December 26, 2015","false","1.9"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","20","26","0","2"

It started off good, story was simple yet interesting. However it becomes easily apparent that this could've been another one of those RPG Maker titles that you find on sites like GameJolt etc.\n\nThe developer could've used actual characters from Valve's game series in terms of fodder enemies, but instead decided to go the even cheaper route by just using random fantasy monster character models and then 'recolouring' them for each different area, because that just screams variety doesn't it?\n\nOh and don't even get me started on the villain, the developer had to resort to the 'Illuminati' as an easy way of making a villain without any actual character development, because f**k, since when did character development ever make a story interesting in the first place?!?!

However, the Illuminati the interferes, and Gaben (along with Mike) decide to try and get to the bottom of it. It's a story of memes and a lot of battles with fantastical creatures from... fantasy lands?\n\nThis game will do a lot to try and burn your eyes with the awful background colour on the UI. You'll also find yourself getting extremely frustrated at the sheer number of encounters as the encounter rate is exceptionally high. At first, the enemies actually do make some sense. Once you get into the random encounters they start just pulling from the stock of RPGMaker assets to fill in. Despite there being several "wings" to the dungeon, one for each element, the enemies are just recolours. There isn't much interesting about the combat as it's usually just a matter of spam attack until you win. Bosses get a bit more strategy in that they involve actually using some skills!\n\nI can't recommend this game at all unless you really want to get into the heavy memes present. Even if you do, I still wouldn't recommend it. Other than the actual enemies that made sense at the start, there really isn't much redeeming about this title.","September 30, 2015","false","3.5"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","19","28","4","0"

I must be honest at first i was ok, it's not as bad as i tought it will, and then couple of minutes later i've got myself into the dungeons and random encounters that happens every 2 steps you'll make... NO, I MEAN NO. This is not fun, this is repetetive and boring as hell and no, i will not force myself to get past that since there is mouthful of better games even in greenlight section. I may be worth checking in future but only if you are really a fan of games like this. It's a shame coz entire concept could be fun and with better execution it could work.

This game has the worst plotline of any game I have ever played. The entire plot revolves around the joke that Valve will never make a Half-Life 3, Portal 3, Left4Dead 3 etc. and they are finally going to release them all at the same time, and the main problem with the game is the entire story relys so heavily on such a lame joke that it gets kind of annoying. The writing in general is just bad. The game uses generic RPG Maker assets and very few outside of the regular RPG Maker assets. The only other assets the game uses are from Google Images and contains copyrighted material from Valve which I am sure they did not approve on. This game should be taken off the market the whole thing deserves a DCMA takedown.","October 17, 2015","false","0.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Sure dont accept to much, it goes about betraying what we know to well from HL2. The gameplay is okay, most time you only need 1 attack only, at the end the game get some more strategy at last boss. The bosses are nothing great but for 2D low production some are well designed like Gladios. Its a short game but it isnt so bad for a Indie Game by 1 person from the 3rd world. The grapics could have some more details, but its okay. I give this game personally as a 2D RPG Fan/ Love 73 %.

I didn't realize this until I got to a far point and had to go back because of another bug. The REAL "Save" button is actually the "Exit" button. The only "Exit" button is F12 on your keyboard, also not letting you take any screenshots.)\n3. Buggy items. (I've only encountered one buggy item thus far, it was a key item that you needed to use to defeat GLaDOS, when I went to examine it, it just suddenly disappeared, like I consumed it. This was also the reason I tried going back but then I realized the "Save" wasn't actually the "Save" button.)\nI wish this game was a lot less buggy, but sadly, it isn't.

I was thinking about this game for a small bit...hesitated playing it because I kept thinking "RPG Maker garbage.  It's gotta be crap".   As usual, the incentive of achievements was laid before me...Well, couldn't be TOO bad, could it?  I got this game as part of a giveaway and to be honest, that's as much as this game should be worth, it's NOT worth the price as it feels like a free game.\n\nPlay as Gabe New...well..."Gaben" to take down a traitor at Valve and ultimately the Illuminati (confirmed?) as part of revenge for the Illuminati sabotaging the release of the "3's" and destroying Valve HQ.  That's as far as the story goes...\n\n\nThe difficulty of majority of the game is that of a beginner JRPG...until the final boss that is.  The random encounter rate is very high and there is no point in running away.  For most of the game, you'll find that you're basically a tank bulldozing every monster and boss you come across while using the glass-cannon strategy of constantly boosting your strength and shield before blasting your enemies to smithereens.\n\nPROS:\nGreat music choices\nNice sense of humor\nGreat references to popular Valve titles and internet culture\n\nCONS:\nPretty short\nRandom monster encounter is too high\nAll of it is easy save for the final boss's final form (which throws the beginner difficulty of the game out the window)\nTypos here and there\n\nI'll admit that my experience with this title was a positive one.  Though I cannot recommend this game for any price, if you managed to get it for free, you should give it a shot.  I also hear rumors that this dev is a middle school student.  Not sure if this is true, but kudos on the game.\n\n6/10   It's not too shabby.

I could forgive the first hour or so. Yes it is all very simply designed and the combat is just spamming the spacebar. But it had it's charm. Encountering 2 heavy's in the basement of Valve and Equiping the Minigun is funny, for the first time. Then it just becomes tedious. Bosses, if I can even call them that, are extremely inconsistent. For example, Robin Walker (the first boss) is extremly braindead and can be beaten by just ramming the spacebar. But is isn't terrible. But then you have bosses like GlaDoS, which are so badly designed which just drains all of the fun out of it. You need to fight GlaDoS five times. Let me repeat that. You need to fight the same boss FIVE ♥♥♥♥ING TIMES. The game is also filled with graphic bugs, like assets placed in wrong positions and levels having weird and stupid structures. Speaking of assets, almost none of them are original. Most of them are basic RPG Maker assets. The second half of the game is completely filled with stock assets from RPG Maker. It's so obvious that it isn't even funny bad. Even the random encounters are just unoriginal and weird enemies. It starts with Heavies and Spies, and then you get trolls? Ogres? Bats? Dragons? ♥♥♥♥ing Succubusses and Lamia's??? The encouter rate is also extremely high, like really high. You can't walk two steps and you get in a random battle. And most enemies can be defeated with 1 or 2 basic attacks. Not even spells, just the basic attack command is enough. The thing that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me of the most is the level design. There isn't any. The "levels" consist of mazes, and mazes, and mazes. Nothing else. It gets really infuriating after 10 minutes of playing. And if it isn't a maze, it's a straight line.\n\nIn conclusion, this game isn't good. At all. Not even for a joke. Don't gift it. It will ruin your friendships. I got it in a bundle at bundle stars so it cost me around 30 cents. I've never been so angry at 1/3 of a cheeseburger.\n\nIf you want more proof that this game is stupid and doesn't need it's place on steam, these are some screenshots from the game. If you want to have a laugh, check them out.\nhttps://gyazo.com/f167704f2e27f547f842f95cf2cba9a8\nhttps://gyazo.com/b4ae53a8a6b0114dc74ae9baa0387c7b\nhttps://gyazo.com/6a0af548d82d1b975558300e2f4c69ec","February 13","false","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

All for the big Triple Steam Summer Sale of the Century but all of a sudden his computer gets sabotaged and all traces of "The Big 3" are lost. Join GabeN and Mike on their quest to investigate who is responsible for this. Is it the Illuminati that are behind this and trying to destroy Valve? Gladdos, The Administrator, Wallace Breen, Hihilanth and Gordon are characters from HL2, Portal 2 and TF2.\n\nGameplay\nThis RPG game reminds me of a 3rd Generation Pokemon game as it has a rather similar fight scene, gold system, item obtainment etc. There are also various weapons to choose from the Community Store, so be careful when choosing your weapons as they deal different damage.  A friendly tip: Make sure to heal yourself often and have full HP before the final boss fight. Prepare yourself well, as the battle will take quite awhile. Also I won't spoil the surprise by telling you who the final boss is.\n\nPros\n+ Wonderful soundtrack.\n+ Simple to play.\n+ Trading cards.\n+ 13 achievements (121 broken achievements permanently removed).\n+ Various weapons, potions and gold inside treasure chests.\n+ Has a save function which allows up to 20 individual saves.\n\nCons\n- Labyrinth battles are tedious and repetitious.\n- Enemies spawn every few seconds in the maze.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI found this an enjoyable game to play and it is well worth the price. I died laughing from the humorous dialogs throughout the game. However, I am sorry to admit that I didn't make it to the final boss and HAD to watch it on a walk thru. Nonetheless, I wish you all the best on your journey!\n\nRating: 7.5/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games to F2P games.\n\nGame key provided by Alex Zhang.\n","March 3","true","10.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Gabe and Mike Johnson then go on a short lived quest to take down the Illuminati once and for all which strangely consists of a bunch of nobodies who have also brought Valve gaming characters to life and a certain someone who is pulling all the strings.\n\nAlong the way you'll be forced to venture through 3 dungeons (Ice, Fire, Nature) that have nothing to do with the plot or even fit within the theme of the game. Fighting Bats, Ogres, Mimics, Assassins, Spiders, other creatures irrelevant to the setting and finally dragons that this game tries to pass off as bosses make this game a bigger joke than it already is.\n\nExploration is also dull as you'll spend most of your time running through hallways and mazes in search of switches that will open a gate located 8 miles near the starting point or near the end where the dragons await.\n\nBattles are a cakewalk for the most part but the game inflates time spent in dungeons by jacking the encounter rate through the roof with EVERY 4-7 steps initiating a battle. Items aren't needed either until the final battle. The UI is godawful with the worst layouts imaginable and it seems stupid to have 3 spaces on the party selection screen when there are only 2 playable characters throughout the whole game.\n\nThere's one puzzle in the game that actually has a chance of finally showcasing the game over screen and then there's the final boss who is the ONLY challenging thing this game has to offer. Oh no, by challenging I mean CHEAP as hell as he can bypass your defenses quite easily and negate invincibility which is facepalm worthy. Have all those items stocked up? Well now is the time to use them.... lots of them.\n\nUPDATE\n\nIt appears the game was given some "tweaks" and the enemy encounter rate lowered after I had beaten it but I'm positive the game still blows. Oh well, at least there's trading cards and 13 new achievements.","January 28","false","4.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I found the humour enjoyable however I was disappointed that most of the enemies weren't actually references to games (as far as I know that is). Most of the dialogue isn't needed because it's only describing the obvious. I really enjoyed the weapon variety but they give you practically infinite gold so that you can buy the best weapon as soon as you get to a shop and barely make a dent in your wallet. The enemies also give you a ton xp and therefor level up all the time and are constantly getting your health and mana regened. This ultimately makes all the random encounter enemies super easy to kill and makes for a pretty damn easy game. I found the only challenging parts of the game were the last two boss battles but I still didn't die once because I was able to keep myself alive using the invinite items that my gold was able to buy me.\nOverall, if you're looking for a good RPG Maker game I'm sure this isn't it but if you want a game that you can laugh at because it's so rediculous than this is the game for you.","December 22, 2015","true","13.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This one however piqued my interest based on 2 things; music and a satirical look at the Illuminati's reach. The trailer music is surprisingly good; it kinda partially sold me to the game.  Still, that wasn't enough reason to part money for GabeN. Fortunately, GabeN comes in the 'Timeless' bundle of 12 games sold by Bundle Stars at 98% discount! Plus, there are a few games in that bundle that interest me hence it's now in my library.\n\nHere if you're interested:  Timeless Bundle. [www.bundlestars.com] Hurry if you want to grab it.\n\nIt's worth it for me just for the music. In the BGM folder there are a total of 106 tracks in various formats. Most of the tracks are about 2 minutes long but don't let that deter you since most of them are good quality 192kbps up to 320 kbps and even one with 2304kbps and many of them are quite impressive IMO. There only are a few tracks between 3-8 minutes long. More than 2 minutes of music is usually indicative of good effort made into its composition, especially when the arrangement is tight and varied. The quality of music is comparable to and might have even surpassed that of Mechwarrior 2 Titanium trilogy tracks in terms of length and quality.\n\nThough i have not played much of the game GabeN, the few tracks i had listened to give me a very positive impression. Why? Because the theme is wholly appropriate and quite consistent with the dark humour of the game. Music varies between genres and moods, between light joyful quirky to heavy epic magnificence. I have derived much enjoyment just listening to the music alone. Granted the music is not without flaws; many generic tracks ended abruptly or not faded out hence they sound jarring and out of sync when looped. However there are also many properly titled tracks that sound just about right and amazing!\n\nNormally i would put off playing these kinds of 2D games until much later on or when i've put enough hours into big budget titles. This title is clearly an exception and i couldn't wait to to hear all the tracks first while writing this review and before delving more into the game. Definitely will play more of this at a later time if only to hear and see how the music is matched to the scene.\n\nOne glaring flaw which you can see from the store screenshots is the choice of colours for dialog box. Seems like a poor choice and not easy on the eyes. However maybe it's intended as a subtle reminder of the underlying violence in the game which due to it's engine cannot be depicted in gory detail. Too much red in the UI. If only the developer had chosen a darker shade of red or even just dark grey, the text would be more legible.\n\nThere's not much i can say about the game itself as it's only been 0.2 hrs but so far the menu system is easy to use and the tutorial is fairly easy to understand. One minor annoyance though, once a conversation has started or a battle begun, you can't quit until the phase is over.\n\nBTW my current favourite track is Urban Knights by Joel Stuedler. Stuedler's seems like a very capable composer judging from a few of his tracks. Graphics is nothing to rave about but if you can look past that then it's worth a look and listen. At least the music tracks are not encapsulated in some obscure format that can't be played outside the game so it's a plus point.\n\nThat's it for now. Maybe more later as i discover more talking points. As it stands, 6/10.","October 14, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","6"

It's simply groundbreaking and I'm sure it will live up to it's name and soon become one of the most sold titles out there.\n\nWhile some of you guys might be wondering; "Why did they change it around and make it RPG this time when it was perfectly fine as FPS?", I can assure you that Valve has really outdone themselves this time. This game is simply put a masterpiece. The soundtrack and sound effects are amazing and so realistic that I first thought someone was shooting outside my apartment. The story is exactly what you'd expect from a sequel to Half-Life 2, full of great dialog and extremely well thought-out character and plot development. Last but certainly not the least, the graphics are amazing. When I first started up the game it took my breath away quite literally. The game world is beautiful to the point where no words can describe it. I can see myself spending hundreds of hours of great quality gameplay time with this wonderful title in the future.\n\nStory: 9/10\nSound: 10/10\nGraphics: 11/10\nGameplay & Mechanics: 9/10\n---\nOverall opinion & score: It's okay. 9/10\n---","September 21, 2015","true","88.7"," 58 of 256 people (23%) found this review helpful 79 people found this review funny","23","58","256","79","4"
