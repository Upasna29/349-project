"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatMakuta/recommended/329050/","ThatMakuta","Extreme Diet Dr. Makuta♪","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatMakuta/","103 products in account","Really a big fan of the series, but I'll try to keep this from influencing this review.\n\nDMC4:SE added three very enjoyable characters, costumes and Legendary Dark knight Mode (Legendary DKM mode is only new for console).\n\nVergil:\n+Moves and skills from DMC3:SE and teleporting trick from DmC are mixed with this character along with moves unrelated.\n+Three weapons to choose from- Beowulf, Yamato, Force Edge.\n+Concentration gauge. Gauge raised by standing still in combat and making hits, losing gauge by missing and running around.\n+Teleporting is good for avoiding enemy attacks and is capable of cancelling most moves.\n+Summoned Sword and various summoned sword techniques in place of guns.\n\nTrish:\n+"Two" weapons- Bare Knuckle and Sword of Sparda. (Bare Knuckle moves are used with "Y" and Sparda used with "B").\n+Sword of Sparda is good for crowd controlling enemies, spins around dragging enemies in.\n+Bare Knuckle combines lightning effect with powerful melee moves in combination with the Sword's crowd controlling.\n+Pandora can be used in Bow, Bazooka, and Laser Cannon mode in place of dual wielded guns. The cannon uses some DT.\n-Dual wielded guns are quite weak and cannot be upgraded to charge. However this is not a big issue since Trish is a melee oriented character.\n\nLady:\n+A vastly different character than any brought into the series before. Completely focused around guns.\n+Three guns to choose from- "Bazooka, Dual Pistols, Shotgun"\n+All of the guns fully charged are insanely powerful. Fully charged shotgun blasts will shred normal enemies and focus down bosses with ease.\n+Since Lady lacks melee weapons combos are focused with guns which she uses with the "B" button.\n+DT releases a huge grenade blast which gives many invincibility frames along with massive damage to enemies.\n-Melee is lacking since the only option is the Bazooka's Bayonete. A "YYY" and "forward Y" aerial attacks, "YYY" and "forward Y" ground attacks. Not much of an issue since you will not normally allow enemies to get close enough for melee to be required.\n\nAll characters are strong in their on right however Lady seems to be superior to all new and old characters in terms of firepower and damage output. However Vergil maintains more versatility due to his ability to switch between three weapons.\n\nCostumes:\n+Each character gets "EX" costumes which switches their color palette to their oposite character. (Trish swaps with Lady, Vergil swaps Dante, etc.) Obtained in game as a reward.\n+Lady gets her old DMC3 costume and Trish gets her Gloria disguise. Obtained through DLC or preorder.\n+Characters start out with customization. (Nero gets a skin of his original design, Dante gets a sparda costume and sparda DT, Vergil gets corrupted Vergil.)\n+Vergil, Dante, and Nero get Super Costumes allowing them Infinite DT. Obtained through DLC or in game reward.\n-Corrupted Vergil costume does not transform him into Nelo Angulus like it does in DMC3:SE. This bothers a few people.\n\nMicrotransaction DLC:\nSome people make a big deal of this without realizing what it actually is. All this DLC is, is a time saver. Everything outside the Lady/Trish costumes can be achieved quite easily in game. No need to buy any of it unless you want to save a little bit of time.\n\nCutscenes:\n+Vergil, Lady/Trish get opening and ending cutscenes which give them reasons to be where they are. Both ending cutscenes both tease information and are welcomed to the game.\n-Vergil, and Lady/Trish do not get replacement cutscenes for story mode. Nero/Dante cutscenes do not even show which some have issues with. These issues do not bother me much, I'm in it more for the gameplay.\n\nControls:\nThis game has no mouse support, if you're a fan of the series and have played DMC3:SE and DMC4 on the PC then you'll know this ahead of time. I do not recommend this game to anyone who does not own a Controller. The only reason you should ever buy this game without a controller is if you wish to break every one of your fingers on the keyboard.\n\nPlay this with a controller.\n\nGame optimization:\n-Missing a few of the optimization options that the original DMC4 had.\n-Motion blur and a strange screen effect are quite annoying and impact FPS and performance. Sadly there is no in game option to remove these effects as of the time this review is made. They must be disabled through hex editor, without them the game runs better and has better FPS.\n-Some are reporting black screens and being unable to open the game, devs are looking into this but no fix as of this review.\n-Performance seems to vary, the majority report that the game works fine while there is a minority who cannot seem to run the game very well. Check your specs before you purchase however the slightly worse optimization compared to the original may be at fault. Hopefully devs are looking into fixing optimization problems.\n-For some reason FPS is slightly lower than the original. I assume this is due to the poor optimization.\n\nOverall:\nIf you enjoyed the other DMC games (1,3,original 4) then you will assuredly enjoy this game. There are those that believe $25 is too much for a "re-release" of a game that they may or may not already own. However the price is fine for the amount of content they have added. On average when compared to other games the addition of 3 characters and 2 new game modes will cost more than 25$ along with the cost of the original game. Optimization is hopefully an issue that developers will fix however as of this review they have not.\n\nI would have given this game a 10/10 however do to the optimization issues I will have to lower my score to 8/10. An extremely good game that will have to settle for a lower score until the optimization issues are cleared up.","June 27, 2015","true","52.6"," 239 of 250 people (96%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","96","239","250","10","11"

It doesn't get much more entertaining than this.\n\n- Sometimes a game goes over the top with trying to be cool and ends up being a horrid experience, but this game goes so far over the top, that it actually starts to work again! You'll just have to experience it to see what that means. This game is crazy! ;-)\n\n- Just make sure you have a controller... you'll be in trouble without one.\n\n\nFor players who are familiar with the series and/or the original DMC4:\n- The graphics felt a bit more polished, as I have played this on X-Box 360 previously. The difference is not staggering however, I could just see the action in slightly greater detail. That's all.\n\n- The new characters have moves that feel familiar gameplay-wise, and in fact are to an extent copied from other DMC titles or combined from existing DMC4 moves (allthough visually most of them look like new stuff). Nevertheless special edition managed to make combat feel fresh and exciting again.\n\n- The amount of video with the new characters acting is nonexistent, which was perhaps the biggest disappointment for me. A short lived disappointment though, since I would already be mashing "skip" on the second playthrough, but that's just how I roll. This might be a deal breaker for some of you ladies and gents out there.\n\n- It was a good time to restart "the grind". Getting everything unlocked is no small task and I gladly welcome the challenge to do so again with the new characters in tow.\n\n\nMiscellaneous stuff:\n- There's something strangely crushing about having a fairly recently assembled high end computer, that runs the in-game benchmark with full settings at a steady 60fps without even so much as a hint of lag - Resulting in a frigging "B"-rating (as in "A" and "S" would have been better). Dunno how the benchmark works, but I couldn't think of a way to tell the difference between the ratings B, A & S. Hunh...\n\n- I've got an (antique) Rumblepad controller and the game is having a tough time recognizing it. It doesn't recognize the D-pad at all for some reason. I had to use keyboard buttons to swap out Dante's styles. Also rotating the camera works when I push the control stick to upper right and lower left corners. In all fairness time to get a new controller!\n\n- Feels like Capcom fulfilled two primary purposes with this release:\n1) Give fans the playable characters that were most requested.\n2) Try out new combinations of combat mechanics and see how players respond... maybe, possibly, hopefully in preparation for the next title!\n\nThanks for reading!","June 25, 2015","true","50.0"," 90 of 98 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","90","98","5","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cuckshooter/recommended/329050/","cuckshooter","dangerous faggot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cuckshooter/","104 products in account","Having played the original Devil May Cry 4 on both console, and on the obviously superior PC (Debug mode, LDK, etc.) I have to say this remastering of the original 2008 game is every bit as worthy of praise as DMC3 special edition. While my profile doesn't show it, I've invested THOUSANDS of hours into DMC4 - way back before it was even launchable on Steam. Jump cancelling, inertia - you name it, I can do it.\n\nHaving three new characters to toy with, even after thousands of hours revitalised a game that was nowhere near dead for me. I've gone through multiple controllers from overuse in the past seven years, and this game has grown up along with me (I'm still pretty young :D). It goes without saying that DMC4 has a special place in my heart, but this isn't me talking out of bias - there are flaws.\n\nAuto-saving is a little jarring. I'm an avid speedrunner (My playtime for DMC4SE is only under 2hrs rihgt now and I've already beat Devil Hunter with Vergil), so having multiple save profiles for test runs would have been nice. It's a small issue though, my biggest gripe is that Debug Mode is no longer present.\n\nOften, Debug Modes are seen as cheatng tools - but for the dedicated, and for those who are REALLY into jump-cancelling, guard flight, inertia, or even combo videos - Debug Mode is a godsend. You can make a measly scarecrow invincible and use it as your personal plaything, toying with it and learning a plethora of moves that would require hours of trial and error to memorise otherwise. I'd have loved to learn Vergil, Lady and Trish this way but it seems I have to continuously bombard Bloody Palace (DMC4's selling point) until I'm at the level of play I am with Dante/Nero.\n\nDespite those two issues though, this game is a refreshing take on my favorite Hack n Slash of all time. The menus are reworked, loading is smoother, the textures are STUNNING (MT Framework is every bit as amazing as the FOX engine imo) and after a bit of tinkering, I was running this game above 60FPS. Vergil is so far my favorite to play as out of the five characters, Lady is slow but very technical which I enjoy (think DmC Dante with his guns), and Trish is just downright broken.\n\nIf you love DMC3/4, if you love Vergil/Lady/Trish, or this is your first DMC game - take it from me - this is worth your money. I will always maintain that DMC4 is the superior DMC game to DmC which came after, and this Special Edition dethrones that 'Definitive Edition' trash the console players got a few months ago.\n\nEnjoy this game, you won't regret it. And to those who feel my pain about Debug Mode - I hope I see some of you on InfernalWorks ;)","June 24, 2015","true","77.8"," 42 of 51 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","42","51","2","4"

You will love playing as the three new characters in the game.\n\nVergil, Lady and Trish are amazing additions to the game. Each with their own style and combo sets. Of course, Nero and Dante are also in the game and they still feel just as awesome as they did in the original DMC 4. It feels amazing to pull off a huge combo and seeing that "SMOKIN' SICK STYLE" in the corner.\n\nAs far as graphics go, It's DMC 4 with a small upgrade. Nothing too special about it but it's still a good looking game. I run this game at a consistant 60 FPS and every move looks smooth and fast. Especially when playing as Vergil. Overall, the game shouldn't be too much for computers to handle. Even then, there are some graphics tweaks you can do to increase performance.\n\nIn the end, this game is amazing. It's Devil May Cry. The style, the amount of cool, the satisfaction is intense. Buy this game if you like hack 'n slash games.

(why they didn't force the reboot through the same development hell is beyond me).\n\nDon't despair over what could've been though, because in this game lies the absolute best and deepest combat system of any single player action game to date, combat so deep that 7 years after the original game's release people were STILL making combo MADs showcasing off the ridiculous impossible looking ♥♥♥♥ they honed through thousands of hours of practice. This game is a must buy just for that reason.\n\nSpecial Edition enhances the game with gorgeous updated graphics and the addition of 3 new characters to the game's 2 already. Trish and Lady are easy to play and get high rankings with for more casual players, and Vergil is a deep character with hardcore challenge that will probably add even more years of life to this game alone. Also, it's wonderfully optimized, my toaster can run it on minimum settings. If this game is on sale, you love action games, and you're reading this right now, don't hesitate, buy it right now.","December 1, 2015","true","25.5"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","17","17","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ramziez/recommended/329050/","Ramziez","Ramirez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ramziez/","320 products in account","Devil May Cry 4 was the first game I owned for my Xbox 360 when I bought it, and I have to say, I love Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition. While it doesn't change too terribly much from the original the added characters Lady, Trish, and Vergil, are an amazing edition to the game. Since the new characters are really the big selling point for the Special Edition I'll just go through my experience with them when I played them.\n\nI started my playthrough of this game as Lady and Trish, and while Lady seems like a kind of lousy character at first once you get her upgrades for charged attacks she becomes a force to be reckoned with and does the most damage out of all the characters in the game being able to do huge screen clearing attacks with her rocket launcher and being able to tear apart shieled enemies with her shotgun.\n\nOnce I got to the point where I played as Trish I wondered how she would play since I didn't really watch promotional material because I like the surprised, and good god, while Lady is the Ranged combat god, Trish is an utter beast at close ranged combat being able to throw the Sword of Sparda just like Dante and Vergil (more on him later) and it homes in on enemies with deadly accuracy, and it is a much easier command than Dante and Vergil. Overall I would say Trish is my second favorite of the new characters behind Lady.\n\nThird is Vergil whom I will admit I don't have a lot of playtime with, mostly because I was busy with the other two stories. His combat is quite diffrent from Lady and Trish's due to the fact that instead of focusing on sheer power like them, he focuses on his concentration bar which you raise by connecting hits but it lowers by an insane degree from missing, running, and getting hit (of course). He's got a small array of weapons too, Force Edge, Yamato, and Gigimesh, and summoninbg swords. I do have to admit the ability to use summoned swords at just about any time adds a huge amount of variety to your combos. Overall though I am personally not a huge fan of Vergil but it might just be my lack of use of him, I am sure once I get used to his quirks I might like him better.\n\nPros: - Three new characters to use.\n-Performs very well on my PC (constant 120 FPS at max settings)\n-New Difficulty setting to test your skill on.\n-Game looks much better than the original.\n-New costumes for every character. Love Vergil's, Trish's Gloria outfit, and Lady's Costumes.\n-Increased drop rate for souls so you can get your moves faster.\n-Awesome Soundtrack (although it didn't change from the original)\n\nCons: -No cutscenes for new characters besides intro and ending (understandable though).\n-Very repeative after beating the game as one set of characters.\n\nAlso I wouldn't reccomend any of the DLC besides the Gloria and DMC3 Lady outfits since everything they are selling can be unlocked in game. So unless you just want a shortcut don't bother.","June 24, 2015","true","22.6"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

First of all Vergil is in the game, no, you don't have to beat the game to unlock him, he is already unlocked from the beginning so you can start having a blast with this Special Edition, he is a lot of fun you have no idea, if you are really going to buy this game just because of him you won't regret it at all. There are 2 new playable characters too, Trish and Lady which they both have their own play style, Lady focuses on using her guns, she hurts enemies by range and throws grenades when she is surrounded (or just use them whenever you think you should), personally didn't like the grenades thing too much, why? because it seems it doesn't matter how much DT you have, the grenades will just last seconds but at least they will do more damage depending on your DT gauge, but it's nothing to worry about though, she is a lot of fun to play and whenever you see the chance to use your charged up Kalina Ann, you won't regret it at all. Now Trish, she is the type of play style you are used to, just do a lot of combos with style, you have unique moves while you are holding Sparda's sword, but when you throw it to an enemy, you have more combos to do without it, I noticed she focuses on doing damage to groups of enemies, so just try to not focus only on one, you want to spare that electricity to your enemies too right? just attack them while they are together and you'll have a decent stylish rank.\nDMC4:SE counts with an autosave system, so you don't have to worry about saving everytime, just keep playing nonstop. They also changed the Speed ability, remember that one that takes a while for you to start running like hell? yeah okay, they reduced the timer a lot and now you can run fast almost instantly, is the first thing you need to buy when you start playing, I think it's awesome.\nI don't think I have to say more, words can't explain how geat this game is, I am very happy what Capcom did with this gem, and I have the best bf in the world for buying it for me. This is not a game, is a gem that you really NEED to buy it if you liked DMC3 a lot like me.\nIf you are hesitating between this game and DmC, buy THIS game, DmC it's not match for this Smokin' Sick Style game! (seriously though, buy this instead of DmC, I like the gameplay of that one but the characters suck, and what they did to Dante is unforgivable).","July 22, 2015","true","37.8"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","3"

No new boss, a small handful of costumes (no shirtless, either), not even a music remix for playing as the new characters so get ready to mute the game's audio and play your own tunes if you're as bored of the default music as I am by this point. To add insult to injury, 2 of the costumes are DLC... a disgusting move by CAPCOM to a game that was already lacking in content so much since the original release.\n\nThis is the bare mininum of what they could've added to justify a Special Edition release. I think they were banking on the idea that Turbo and LDK (loads'a enemies mode) being new 'features' despite being in the original PC release 7 years ago. Hell, they even advertised 60fps and that was in the original PS3 and XB360 release... which back then was an actual standard and didn't need to advertise it.\n\nI'm a huge DMC fan and I just cannot recommend this to any other DMC fan whose looking to make an informed purchase. No, it's not terrible. It's DMC4 with 3 extra characters who are not bad, but have the same flaws of Dante & Nero... rushed and lacking depth when you actually understand them. If you still cannot get enough of DMC4 to this date...  then of course buy it. If you're new to the series and happily slicing through them from 1-3, of course, get it.\n\nBut if you're like me, someone who likes DMC4 but couldn't stomach it any longer from the sheer shallowness of it compared to the previous games, then skip this. It's just not enough content and is precisely not worth your time/money. If there were just a few more costumes, none as paid DLC and maybe just one music remix in-game and maybe a sky-box change in blood palace... it would just be enough for me to give it a thumbs up. But as it stands, this is CAPCOM just trying to milk you.","July 19, 2015","false","62.0"," 76 of 131 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","76","131","3","2"

The game performance is great, no issues here. For references:\n\nPC specs:\n-----------\nIntel i5 3570k\nGeforce 670\n16 GB Ram\n\nSettings:\n----------\nResolution: 1920x1080\nEvery graphic setting on max\n\nLowest frame rate on performance test i had was 140 FPS. The game runs great, there's not even tearing appearing for me even though i don't have VSync enable, great stuff!\n\nWhat else to say:\n\nGameplay definitely got an upgrade, feels a lot smoother (for example load up time to start sprinting was lowered). Every character has his own moveset which takes quite some time to get together. Mainly played Vergil so far and the amount of potential combos is huge.\n\nCharacters don't seem to have much of an own story line and hardly any customized videos so far. But only played a few missions so far, maybe there's more than expected. You start with a full weapon set on the new characters, thus you don't need to play the "main" game first to dive fully into the new content\n\nVisual presentation is great, nice light and shadow effects. High res textures, not much to say and nothing to complain here.\n\nVoice over seems solid, no complains about not fitting voices or anything.\n\nResult: Everyone who loved DMC4 and who feels like, he wants to go the extra mile and get everything in terms of archivements can definitely grab this game and won't be disappointed. But especially for Hack'n Slay fans who didn't own DMC4 yet: 25 bucks for a massive game like this is nothing. If you love slashing monsters, you love over the top action and coolness, grab this game. If you guys are not sure, just check out some streams on Twitch.tv to get a better idea of the game.\n\nEdit:\n\nPlease be aware, that mouse and keyboard support is not really given. If you don't have a gamepad, better not go for this game.\n\nOther than that your previous DMC4 save files will not be recognized! You have to start over completely, keep that in mind\n\nEdit2:\n\nPeople seem to have significantly worse performance compared to the standard version, sometimes dropping from 300 FPS in the old version to around 120FPS. Didn't really compare it to the old version but it seems to be a lot more demanding because of the post-processing and blur effects, especially for older hard ware. If you have high resolutions (4k etc.) and monitors with high refresh rates, you might want to check if you hardware can handle the necessary load to prevent tearing or other hard frame drops.","June 23, 2015","true","11.5"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

Graphics were really upgraded and feels way more smooth.\n\nVergil was op on DMC 3. He is a god here. He is precise, fast and fun to play. I'm so glad they decided to bring this to us.\n\nLady is a completely different character from the others, I see her as a challenge but a fun one. Her style of gameplay is way different from the others yet that does not make her boring, instead she is so fun and it's great to try a new style on DMC. She does a lot of damage\n\nI still need to get Trish and i'll update this but i'm giving this Special Edition 9/10 due to the lack of story.\n\nEDIT: Tried out Trish and my god! You might have thought that she was a clone of Dante but no! She does have some moves as Dante but she totally feels different. She is the fastest in the game and she can do some pretty awesome combos. She like Lady feels different from the others :)\n\nI encourage you to buy this game in support of Capcom even if you already have 4 and to please give it a chance since they did improved it a lot. New characters feels like a totally new game and you can have a lot fun, I haven't stop playing since yesterday.","June 23, 2015","true","63.1"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","20","29","0","0"

Or I could just say this: This is the definitive Devil May Cry when it comes to gameplay. 1 and 3 outclass it in level, enemy, and boss design, but the raw gameplay of this iteration outclasses any other. This applied to the original version, and it's even more true now. With 5 playable characters and all the returning characters appearing with their greatest movesets yet, this game is an absolute blast to play. Oh, and it's only 25 dollars. For the amount of content that you're getting, that's an absolute steal. If you're a fan of series and have played the regular version of 4, I still say this game is worth it to play as the definitive versions of Vergil, Lady, and Trish. And if you're newer to the series, this is a solid place to start.\n\nTL;DR: Play this game. Now.\n\n\nP.S. A little note on microtransactions: Aside from the the "super" costumes (which I do feel are a bit too OP for microtransaction stuff), I don't think any of it's really that bad, as it really just saves you time. This is a very skill-focused game, so money can only get you so far. I only see it as being good if you're a series vet and want to rush right into high difficulties, and want to purchase the in-game resources to make that plausable.","June 30, 2015","true","56.2"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

It's really difficult to dislike playing as him though, as the game still retains its challenge and Vergil’s technique is something unique to DMC 4.\n\nMove-wise: Trish is the middle ground between Dante and Vergil. With no weapon switching she is as forward as Nero but with a more powerful move-set and a unique control scheme. You'll rely mainly on her combo of hand to hand and Spardas sword. She has near instant access to Pandora’s combinations which can potentially drain her Devil Trigger.\n\nLady is skilled in firearms, as a result of this her combat consist of finding the right distance and time to charge weapons or use special firemodes. She can get a SSS rank quickly in one move, but this requires quick response and planning. Charging her Katrina Ann and keeping it accurate is no easy task for most enemies. For quick combat you would be more likely to use her pistols and shotgun, which charge in shorter time and have a wider range.\n\nThe port is probably the most negative aspect to this update.\nWhile Its difficult to match the quality of DMC4s original port, SE sadly has some issues.\nGraphically the textures and effects are definitely improved, some more than others but it is certainly noticeable and looks great.\nThe game however adds an unwelcome Motion Blur and Depth of Field effect that cannot currently be turned off in-game.\nIt tanks some older computers performance and just doesn't look as smooth as DMC4 used to during high action.\nWhile I respect the implementation I think many would simply just like to choose what effects to have on or off.\nI've heard rumors of an upcoming patch and its less than a week since release, so hopefully this gets fixed relatively quickly.\n\nIn short:\nIt's the great hack and slash Devil May Cry 4 but with more content.\nFor $25 is a pretty good deal for DMC fans.\nPort needs a patch","June 27, 2015","true","147.9"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","13","17","3","0"

When I heard about DMC4 Special Edition, I felt the hype.  For me personally, Vergil was my favorite character back in DMC 3, I was better with him then I was with Dante.  So How does this version hold up? Does it surpass the ever infamous DMC 3 Special Edition?\nNo\nNo it does not\n\nBut that doesn't mean that this game is bad, quite from it, DMC 4 Special Edition was that extra little polish the DMC 4 needed to make it a great game.  It has costumes, a feature that was lacking in the original version of DMC 4, new characters. Vergil, Trish, and Lady.  Each character has unique gameplay that really adds to the replayability of DMC 4. Before delving into the characters and the story, first the port.\n\nIn my personal experiance of the 32 hours I have put into this game, I have not crashed once, no weird graphic bugs, nothing, and it runs smooth as butter. Though there are people reporting that they are having issues, I run a GTX 960 and have no problems. Other then that, it's a great port. At least for me.\n\nThe three new characters as said before is Vergil, Trish, and Lady.\nVergil is an absolute speed demon on 20 different kinds of drugs, all of his attacks can be followed up with an immediate teleport.  This reincarnation of Vergil is much MUCH more powerful then the DMC 3 Counterpart, that being said, I do have an issue with Vergil (Personal issue, not deducting points from the game for this.)\n\nVergil is much faster yes, but I do not feel like I have as much control over him as I did in DMC 3, this might be due to the fact that Vergil's Dark Slayer style, does not have all the added benifits from DMC 3. All dark slayer does now is teleport to enemy, and act as a double jump, that's it.  While back in DMC 3, we could teleport to an enemy, teleport away from an enemy(You have no idea how much I miss that move) and act as a potential triple jump, if a wall kick was used, if not, then it was just a double jump.  One more thing about Vergil is that he can sometimes feel very "easy button."\n\nThrough my playthrough of the game, I discovered that activating DT and spamming Vergils dash attack with Yamato would cause some bosses to lose half of their health before the DT gauge was empty. Yes, this was on normal, I did attempt this on Legendary Dark Knight, still does decent damage, but it still feels "easy button." but that is my own personal gripe.  Besides from those two things, Vergil is an extremely fun character, espically on LDK.\n\nTrish is bascially a rehash of DMC 1 Dante, for those of you who have played it will know what I am talking about.  Core moves from the first game make a reappearance along with some new moves for Trish to play with.  She is very fast, her combos can be brutal, espically if you time your combos well with the lingering lighting effects.  Sparda is a great sweeper and can keep crowds in check, I have not played with her on LDK but I am looking foward to it.\n\nLady...Dear god Lady. She has EXTREMELY OP range, considering her character though, that makes sense, but charging up that shotgun and going into a big crowd just rips fools apart. Lady does not have a standard DT, but rather she has a grenade Gauge, I two shotted the first boss using this\nIT WAS AWESOME\nStill though, Lady was awkward to play with at first since she is so unconventional in terms of DMC gameplay, but just give it some time and practice and she might very well become your favorite character.\nVergil will always be number one in my book though.\n\nThe story is this, you demon hunter, demons, go kill.  Let's be honest, the story has never been the strong point of any DMC game, but this games story is as follows.\nYour first character is Nero, you have a weird arm, you are a knight of some order or whatever and ummm....Dante comes in and kicks ♥♥♥. Look, I watched the cutscenes like one time and always skipped after that.\n\nA bit of catioun though, if you are buying this game to learn more about Vergil's story but are not a huge fan of DMC 4 I would not reccomend this game to you. The "New Vergil Story" has a total of 2 cutscenes.\nTWO CUTSCENES\nI thought I was going to get intervals of Vergil's journey through out the game but nope\n1 cutscene in the begginning, and 1 cutscence at the end, and to be honest it does't really explain much at all, but I won't spoil that...what little there is to spoil anyway...\n\nAll in all, DMC 4 SE put some fine tuning and polish one, and it make a good game(DMC 4) a great game(DMC 4 SE)","February 5","true","37.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HeavyWeaponsBaby/recommended/329050/","HeavyWeaponsBaby","Diana Night","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HeavyWeaponsBaby/","209 products in account","So of now I have played every character and beat their campaings (Do not be confused, everyone goes through the same campaing)\n\nAnd I must say, I never had this plenty of fun in a game in a while. I alreadly reviewed DMC4 vanilla, so you should read that, as here we will look at how Special Edition expands upon DMC4.\n\nNo matter how we look at it DMC4 lacked in content greatly and Special Edition easily makes up for it with 3 new characters with their play styles, new costumes for each character, new cut-scenes for the new characters  (They don't add anything to the story but it's nice to see these characters again) and tweaks to the gameplay and few graphical changes.\n\nThe main selling point of this edition is the Dante's twin brother Vergil who first appeared in DMC3 and was first playable in the DMC3's Special Edition, he now returns with far greater move list than ever before, he borrows some mechanics from DMC3 and DmC and also has new moves and concentration mechanic, this makes him the defenitive version of Vergil.\n\nHe is equiped with three weapons, that being Yamato, Beowulf and Force Edge. He also can summond swords which he can use in many ways to damage the enemy or to combo them. Best way to describe Vergil's play style would probably be "risk/reward" as you have concentration mechanic, a bar which fills up when you slowly walk around in a fight and dodge attacks and sucesfully hit the enemy, it depletes when you run or get hit (when you get hit it goes down to zero) the more of this bar you have, the stronger Vergil's attack become, he is still very strong even without, but with it he is a beast. Vergil is a perfect character for everyone, for beginners and experts, even though experts who are used to his DMC3 gameplay will have to get used to few changes, such as trick down being only usable only in devil trigger amongs of other features which are only avaible in his devil trigger form. Vergil is an incredibly fast character with his main way of getting to enemies being teleporting, his teleporting is really quick and can be pretty much spammed for all enternity.\n\nI am a big fan of Vergil's gameplay, as time goes on I may actually start maining him instead of Dante.\n\nLady and Trish share their campaing, with Lady going through Nero's mission and Trish's Dante's. Lady is a gun focused character she is basically an upradged gunslinger from DMC3, but with far greater strenght than ever before, she packs two pistols which can be charged to 3 levels, when charged shots are fired in the air it gives her a knockback, which can be proven most useful, she then also has a shotgun which also can be charged to 3 levels, when fully charged it is an incredibly OP weapon which pretty much blasts away anything, and then there is Kallina An, as you've expect it can be charged to 3 levels.\n\nLady was a surprising character who somehow works, she is really a lot of fun to play and changes the way you play the game entirely. I honestly didn't expect her to work as well as she did. Because Lady isn't a demon her "devil triger" is her throwing grenades all around herself destroying everything around her, just like Nero's DT it has a lot of invicible frames, which suits Lady perfectly as she is a character who isn't meant to get too close to enemies\n\nThen there is Trish who has a Sparda's sword and her fists of fury and Pandora's Box. Trish's gimmick is that she doesn't weapon switch yet she can use these weapons on the fly. She is a very flashy and fun character mostly meant for crowd control, after she throws her Sparda's sword she can do different moves with her fists, she is very quick and can disable enemies from attacking very quickly, yet she deals  lower damage, even with that she is very effective and fun to play.\n\nSpecial Edition also comes with new costumes, with Nero receiving his prototype costume which he was meant to have in the vanilla, it looks wonderful, he also has a costume where he cosplays as his daddy Vergil, it's cute I guess.\n\nDante has of course Sparda's costume...and Donte (DmC) costume, which funnily enough he looks better in it than Donte.\nVergil has corrupted Vergil costume and Vante costume.\nLady and Trish have their costume as DLCs, even though their costumes which you buy are easily the most "meh" Trish's Gloria costume is nothing to behold, I never liked Gloria's design, and Lady's DMC3's look doesn't look right to me for some reason\n\nYou still have free costumes as these characters though, Lady has a costume where she cosplays as Trish and Trish has the costume where she cosplays as Lady.\n\nAs fot the tweaks, and things I noticed, everything seems positive and an improvement, let me list:\nGyroblades activate much much faster, they're pretty much fixed now and are no boring chore anymore\nDice Game has been slowed down and is much easier to do and manipulate to get to where you want it to go, it's actually kind of nice now, believe it or not.\nAll character's "spring" abillity activates right away, making the exploration throughout levels much faster.\nAll characters can now throw the swords which Nero only could throw around with his buster, they do it by simply hitting it.\nDante's round trip seem to activate faster.\nProud souls drop rate is doubled\nAUTO-SAVES!\n\nThat is all I could find, I am happy with all  these changes though, as for graphics, it is more questionable, the game adds some nice lighging effects into the game which makes the game look prettier than before, but then there is the motion blur which some will despise and it doesn't help it cannot be turned off, I like it though, I think it's nice and makes it seem like the game is even faster, still, there should be an option to turn this damn thing off.\n\nAny other parts where the edition dropped the ball? I guess it bothers me that new characters have no new battle themes, you'll just be "bringing the fables from thy tomb as kinghts loam" again and again. Which is unfortunate, I love DMC's soundtrack, I always did and I was looking forward of hearing new tracks, oh well.\n\nSo why should you buy Special Edition? Wel, it's not a hard buy in my opinionl;\nIf you really liked DMC4, it has a lot of content so it's easy to justify it being bought again\nIf you never played or bought DMC4, just buy this, don't bother with vanilla DMC4, there is no reason to buy that over this.\n\nDefinetelly recommended\n\n\nDisclaimer: Please do not get into microtransactions which are here, only the costumes (Gloria, Lady) are hidden behind a pay wall, rest of the game's content can be unlocked without you having to throw money into your screen, please do not support this travesty. Do not encourage Capcom to put this into their next titles.","June 23, 2015","true","260.3"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

Basically what SE is, is 3 extra characters added into Vanilla DMC4. Lady, Trish and Vergil.\n\nLady offers almost exclusively ranged gameplay (which isn't good in a game like this) but she plays so differently from the others that shes worth a go. She is playable in Nero's missions.\n\nTrish is mostly a frankensteined moveset from Dante and a couple of Vergil's moves. Her unique mechanic is to throw her Sword for a few seconds and use alternate abilities. She specializes in mass AoE abilities. Playable in Dante's missions.\n\nVergil is largely his DMC3 moveset with a few ques taken from DmC's version of Vergil. He is so completely broken (in the right hands) that the other 4 characters cannot even come close to his potential. Vergil can clear Legendary Dark Knight missions (which have a staggering amount of enemies) in the same time that other characters take to clear Dante Must Die missions.\n\nAt the end of the day, it is still the half completed game that DMC4 was, but the new characters are so much fun to play as and the extra costumes still keep me coming back to Nero and Dante.\n\nMy personal recommendation is to new  comers, hardcore fans, or to those who never really put time into vanilla DMC4 because the entire roster of "Team DMC" is here and every single one of them is awesome to play as.","April 1","true","303.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

To call 2 less than stellar would be the understatement of the century, yet 3 still proudly claims its place as the absolute pinnacle of the entire freaking genre. Then just two years ago we recieved a very unnecessary and quite poor reboot in the way of DmC: Devil May Cry. And now we recieve the Special Edition of the last proper entry of the series with Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition. This is a faar better game than what we got the first time around. Not to say the original 4 was bad, far from it, but it's clear it wasn't the product it was supposed to be. While Special Edition doesn't fix that, it makes it quite a bit easier to forget that fact. The only real problem I have is the mandatory dash that you do outside of combat if you equip it instead of being able to toggle or something. Anyways. If you somehow haven't played this, you need to get on that.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheCitizenErased/recommended/329050/","TheCitizenErased","CitizenErased","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheCitizenErased/","112 products in account","Isn't it weird to think that Devil May Cry originally was planned as a sequel in the long running Resident Evil franchise? It spawned from a lost concept intended for Resident Evil by one Hideki Kamiya. Ever since it has evolved into a bonifide and excellent action franchise, spawning 3 sequels, one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reboot, an anime, probably a manga and a love pillow? You name it. It was dropped from being a Resident Evil game due to its supernatural elements and presence of "demons" not quite fitting the conservative tentacle-sausage monsters that look like they spawned from the deepest recesses of H.R. Geiger's soul, well enough\n\nYou could even be forgiven for thinking that recent Resident Evil titles seemingly bears striking similar elements to that of a Devil May Cry game with its radical tendency to burst into cinematic overload mode, with unfair quicktime events and ridiculous over-the-top stunts that defy all logic and physic laws as we know it. Devil May Cry 4 carries the term "over-the-top" with pride as it comfortably ravels in its glorious legacy as a great hardcore over-the-top action title.\n\nThe original Devil May Cry 4, however, had its share of issues like its nagging prediclection of repition in vein of Silent Hill 4. Half-way through the story you're bold-facely forced to walk in reverse order of the entire game's map and beat the same bosses twice along with the dreadful padded "board-game" section. The enemies are also a bit uninspired in comparison to the likes of Devil May Cry 3--Plus, can I just say that I hate camera sometimes? It's litterally the toughest enemy in the game to conquer. Bad, bad, bad, Capcom.\nLooking past that however, Devil May Cry 4's combat is delightful. The ability to launch enemies in the air and litterally keep them there by filling every orifice with lead as Dante, or cutting them in mid-air as Nero while using the Devil Arm as a bolster for keeping the momentum in motion.\nWhat is excellent about the Special Edition is the awesome addition of the 3 new playable characters. Lady, Trish and Vergil--All of them carry simply excellent movesets, unique to them and their personalities. Vergil borrows a lot of his abilities moveset from DMC3 and from Vorgil in the Ninja Theory's edgy reboot. He's ridiculously fast and precise with his katana "Yamato" which is balanced by his more brutal strikes with the gloves and boots he got in DMC3 (forgot the name) delivering powerful blows that will usually deal devastating damage at the expense of his speed-Oh, and of course Force Edge, which is more or less his father's sword, and grants him movesets similar to his brother Dante. Vergil relies on speed and precisition(as mentioned). The more precise you are with each attack, the faster he becomes, it is imperative that all attacks hit home while also attempting not to get hit in order to the get the most out of him.\n\nLady is a loaded powerhouse of ridiculous weaponry that will quite simply devastate all enemies, which makes her so much fun to play, but will probably diminish a lot of challenge from the game. But who cares? She's fun, damnit! Her shotgun and pistol attacks are similar to Dante's but vastly more powerful and packs quite a punch to enemies. Her shotgun can litterally make enemies bound off and on walls until they die should you position yourself appropriately for it to happen. She also has a form of grappling hook, which she can use to launch enemies into the air and smack them down again, or if you're a creative ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, to line them up for a shot with the rocket, in the air, and/or the guns for some extra Stylish points.\n\nTrish is the character I have least experience with yet -- So far she seems to play a bit similar to Dante though she has plenty of interesting range attacks using the sword Sparda, or whatever hell they call that monstrosity of a sword. I have admittedly not a lot to say about her yet but safe to say she's just as fun as the rest to play. I assure you!\n\nThe inevitable failings of remasters, as mentioned, is that they are usually always put into the uncomfortable position of carrying all of the detrimental issues the original had with them. I've lined most of them all up already, though they are easily ignored when playing the new characters because said additions to the Special Edition outweigh anything bad I have to say about the game... Well, except for the visuals. Its age is still showing and the remastered visuals aren't really taking advantage of my powerhouse PC's capabilities, so I can't really vouch for it there.. Maybe I just haven't optimized it properly but I wouldn't say the looks are anything to jump in glee over\n\nHaving said that -- Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition has build upon what was a pretty good game and made it into a really fun game! If you love games from Platinum or action titles in general then you shouldn't cheat yourself out of the Special Edition for DMC4.. Buy it, whenever it goes on sale anyway!","April 4","true","30.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","1"

It's wierd because the game runs fine for me with every character at 60 fps but ttrish just causes issues sometimes.\n\nOther than that Love the new characters Lady is probably my new favorite she's extremely powerful.

I've at least finished each game once or twice, even the reboot. I loved every game, yet Devil May Cry 4 was always a big favourite of mine. When I heard that the special edition was being released, I got super excited and pre-ordered it straight away.\n\nI don't regret doing that.\n\nThe special edition makes this game 10 times more enjoyable as new characters such as Vergil, Lady and Trish were added to the game. These characters were developed smoothly and beautifully and I could play these characters for several hours straight. The storyline is interesting and the side quests are challenging yet not impossible. There are a lot of things to unlock in this game which can take a long time to do, such as complete all of the difficulties (which I found almost impossible to do since I was so bad at the game). Honestly, repeating the game over and over again in different difficulties doesn't feel repetative at all. It's still a very enjoyable game to me even if I played for hours and hours for each day of the week.\n\nI can't say that there is anything bad in the game. The game itself runs very smoothly and I haven't caught any bugs in the 1000 hours I have played in my life.\nIf you're a big fan of the Devil May Cry series and isn't sure whether it's worth buying this again but in the special edition OR you're just a big fan of hack and slash games, I definitely recommend this game to you and I guarentee you that you will love it.\n\nRate: 10/10","February 17","true","49.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drspud/recommended/329050/","drspud","Dr. Spud","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drspud/","316 products in account","DMC4 is my favorite stylish action game. Now you get 3 new characters. That's CRAZY. And they are super well-designed. It's a Special Edition re-release that has more new mechanics than most sequels.\n\nMaybe you thought Nero played pretty differently from Dante. Vergil, Lady, and Trish are on a whole other lever. Hell, I think they feel more distinct than 2013's DmC does, and that game was supposed to be a reboot. And we're in a time when most new action games are Batman clones. These characters are a reminder that, yeah, there's a lot of uncharted territory in action game mechanics.\n\nVergil is a character about moving slowly and striking efficiently. He has a "concentration" gauge that fills up by standing still and walking, and drains when he misses attacks or runs. So you get to pace around enemies like a badass as you summon phantom swords that do the work for you, before teleporting to enemies and slashing them up. You get this cool back-and-forth between slow pace and fast pace. And instead of attacking / dodging / running like you normally would, you rely on your teleports to dodge and don't miss a beat with your attacks. It matches his style from DMC3 cutscenes.\n\nLady only has guns, and melee is a very minor part of her playstyle. She's all about distancing herself from enemies and raining down rockets and bullets. After buying yourself time, you can choose from a variety of ranged combos. The most damage she can deal out is by charging up her rocket launcher, which deals pretty ridiculous damage when fully charged. Like Vergil, Lady introduces some slower-paced decision making with her mechanics. She's the most unique character of the 5 IMO.\n\nTrish is a less wild departure from traditional Devil May Cry. She can throw out her sword to spin and trap enemies in an AOE, and her moveset changes when she does this. She also has the ability to leave lightning streaks in the air after one of her arial attacks, which also trap enemies. You can use these tricks to maximize damage on one enemy, or keep enemies occupied while you work on different threats. You can also get really creative with how you knock enemies into your AOEs.\n\n\nI have gripes, and they are the same gripes with the original DMC4. It still sucks that you backtrack for the 2nd half of the campaign. The story is still not as interesting as DMC3's. The lock on system will still occasionally not select the right enemy, and some of the fixed camera angles are awful. The last points I wish they would have fixed in the Special Edition.\n\nAlso, the 3 new characters get the same campaign minus cutscenes. It's... fine. But given how good the characters are, it's a shame they don't get something unique to play (or at least variations on the campaign). But hey, it's not a sequel.\n\nAt the end of the day, the characters are the important part, and they totally deliver.","July 3, 2015","true","31.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It's everything the original was with much more to offer with the addition of being able to play as  Vergil,   Lady,  and  Trish  with them having stories of their own, well sort of really its just a cutscene at the start and finish and they do the same things as  Nero  and  Dante,   Lady = Nero  and  Trish = Dante,  but  Vergil  takes his own by himself filling both  Nero  and  Dantes  rolls so you'll be killing all the main bosses  twice  with Vergil, technically  three  times. When it comes to playing as everyone you won't have to worry about  Nero  and  Dante  they seem to have nothing changed about them, but the new gems are  Lady  and  Trish  along with the return of our beloved  Vergil  to the field!\nVergil  is back in his prime bringing what he offered in  DMC3  with  Yamato,   Beowulf,  and  Force Edge  all retaining their moves and few new move similar to what his  Dmc: Devil May Cry  version does and also has a new "Concentration" mechanic, to summarize it basically if you fight as  Vergil  would your attackes are a lot stronger and more rewarding.\n\nLady  is and interesting new character to play with her making more use of ranged then melee where everyone does more melee than ranged. She brings to the table her signature  Kalina Ann,  duel pistols and a shotgun and these are the weapons you will be using the whole time when taking on demons. Unlike everyone else,  Lady  does not have a  Devil Trigger  with her being a pure human, instead she has a grenade count that increases the same way  Devil Trigger  would, but instead of it draining rapidly she uses it all in one go. Her grenades will pretty much kill everything they touch, pardon my language but she will literally make bosses her *****.\n\nTrish  in my opinion is the least interesting of the new characters, when playing as her she uses the legendary  Sparda  sword, her guns  Luce & Ombra,   Pandora,  and her lightning attackes. When fighting as her she have a good amount of moves to use but when it comes down to it you'll be using some of the same moves over and over since some are a lot more useful than others. It's more than likely me just being bad as her but when fighting bosses as  Trish  her attackes never really hurt them as much as everyone elses, with her I can takes hordes of demons with her no problem, she will kill regular demons like they were nothing, but bosses would not die for me as her, again more than likely I'm just bad.If I could also rate the characters enjoyment in my opinion it would be:\nDante\nVergil\nNero\nLady\nTrish Other new additions to be said is that everyone has costumes to use now instead of just switching from regular to Super.\nNero  - Regular, Super Nero, Prototype, EX Nero (regular with colors similar to Vergil)\nDante  - Regular, Super Dante, Legendary Dark Knight, EX Dante (regular with colors similar to Dmc:Devil May Cry Dante)\nVergil  - Regular, Super Vergil, Corrupt Vergil, EX Vergil (regular with colors similar to DMC3 Vergil boss fight as Vergil)\nLady  - Regular, DMC3 Lady, EX Lady (regular with colors similar to Trish)\nTrish  - Regular, Gloria, EX Trish (regular with colors similar to Lady) Pros:  + More characters to play with\n+ More costumes\n+ More Modes\n\nNeutral:  : Vergil, Lady and Trish will do the same things as Nero and Dante, it's not a big deal but could have been more.\n\nCons:  - Vergil, Lady and Trish's story was only two cutscenes start and finish each which was kind of disappointing\n\n9/10\nDevil May Cry® 4 Special Edition  is a nice remaster of the original and is worth the purchase of any fan of the original or series in general, if you haven't purchased either this or the original I'd advise this over the original with this having a lot more content at its disposal than the original.","July 4, 2015","true","99.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hideo_suzuki/recommended/329050/","hideo_suzuki","Hideo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hideo_suzuki/","448 products in account","This review is only about the performance of the port\n\nI NEED MORE POWER!!\n\n...to be able to run this game. I consider the original DMC4 on PC one of the very, very best ports ever made. But this port? Comparison is at the end.\n\nCapcom updated the engine for this title, so now there's Motion Blur, Depth of Field and "God Rays" light effects. So, um, good news? Not really, and that's the funny thing: It looks worse now.\n\nMotion Blur in itself is completely sick, because its actual purpose is to conceal the low framerate in movies (which run at 24 FPS). So you essentially spend graphics power to simulate a lower framerate (at least that's my explanation). And Depth of Field looks just... weird here, the same with God Rays. The game was just not made with them in mind. And not only does Motion Blur and Depth of Field look bad here, they also need a lot of graphics power.\n\nSo, why am I going so much into detail with these effects? If you don't like them, just turn them off, right? Well, jokes on you: You simply can't. You have to edit the Executable of the game with a hex editor to disable Motion Blur and Depth of Field. Good news is that it's very easy to do and there's even a good guide in the Community Hub.\n\n\nComparison Original and Special Edition\n\nMy Specifications:\nIntel Core i5-2500K @ 3.30 GHz\nAMD Radeon 5770[www.amd.com] (from 2010)\n\nNow, about the performance... I can play the original with max settings at 1920x1080, probably 4xAA, with solid 60 FPS ingame and in cutscenes. This port? I can play with (almost solid) 60 FPS ingame and 25-45 FPS in cutscenes at 1280x720 with 4xAA, and that's only after I disable Motion Blur, Depth of Field and God Rays. This is worse than the Xbox 360 version of the Original, which runs with almost the exact same settings (only difference is that it has 2xAA) with constant 60 FPS.\n\nThe reason I still recommend it: It's still a fantastic game and Capcom shows that the old DMC isn't dead. It's just a shame that the port is somewhat shoddy. But if you have the graphics power, don't worry.","July 4, 2015","true","13.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

Or you missed the opportunity to purchase DMC4, this is by far the superior edition.  It's optimized more for newer OS' and Direct X versions.

The extra content is nothing more then just character swaps and extra extra extra hard mode. This game feels cheap. What i mean by cheap is that nothing has really changed. It feels like they just added the characters and called it a day. There is no training mode to test out the skills you buy, the controls are not updated and just feel slugish compared to DMC:devil may cry remake and there is no new campaignfor the new characters. The same problems the original had are still in this one. That said i do really enjoy playing as vergil in dark knight mode, its amazing.\n\nThe worst part of all is that now the whole game is backtracking over and over and over. As Nero you play till the mid point and then Dante takes over and you get to play the same levels in reverse order, after that you get to do it again and again with the new characters. I would have loved a campaign for the new characters even if it wasnt as long as the main story.\n\nGet this game if you are a big fan of dmc.\n\nWished they had updated a few things.\nAlso the hell with day 1 dlc\nfunk off with dlc\n\n6/10","June 29, 2015","true","31.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And the added features didnt seem that fulfilling. I couldnt have been more wrong. This game is simply worth the twenty pups on Vergils gameplay style alone. It was fantastic. Absolutely amazed at how stylish and fluid the gameplay has been polished to. PS. Jump still sucks ♥♥♥. I implore any fan of the franchise to buy it. There are a few grips for me which were. Fullscreen mode is buggy when you want to shift in and out of windows.\nThe cutscenes. I didnt mind the original cutscenes being cut in vergil mode. But they brought the original voice actor in to do Vergil again. Why they didnt see fit to utilize this and add some juicy cutscenes of his own. I dont know. Overall though the game has renewed my love of DMC, (I hated DmC) I pray to god they give Vergil his own game or simply bring him back in a main story line. I also enjoyed the fact they gave each character in this a nice little ability that nobody else could have IE Vergil could collect orbs from further away ect. It added that extra little bit of versitility in each seperate gameplays.\n\n\nSolid 8/10 for me","October 1, 2015","true","17.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TWILTHERO/recommended/329050/","TWILTHERO","TWILTY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TWILTHERO/","92 products in account","Devil May Cry 4 has a lot of great things going for it. It has probably the best combat in any hack and slash game out there, 5 very different playable and unique characters to choose from, runs great (I don't have the best laptop, but I was able to run it pretty smoothly with low settings), some very fun boss fights, pretty cool music (THE TIME HAS COME AND SO HAVE I) and while the story is kind of...meh, it still has some cool moments (mostly the Dante parts). Overall, I really really enjoyed it, and while it's not as complete as Devil May Cry 3 as an overall product (I have the HD Collection on PS3), it was still a game that kept me coming back for more and more. Vergil's such a fun character to play as and Lady and Trish are really cool characters in their own right.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is still essentially only half finished, with the second half of the game basically repeating the first half, but in reverse. I didn't mind it as much since Dante and Nero played very differently, but it's still such a shame the game's an unfinished as it is. That said, this is probably an easy purchase if you're a fan of the DMC series/hack and slash games. Newcomers may want to think about it or maybe wait for a sale.\n\nI really hope Capcom learns from their mistakes in this game if Devil May Cry 5 ever happens because it has huge potential to be an absolutely amazing game. DMC4 I feel is only half an amazing game sometimes and that's a crying shame. I'm probably expecting too much from today's Capcom, but I really want to have faith. Hopefully, it will happen though, but until then, We Shall Never Surrender...","October 18, 2015","true","44.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Okay, that isn't true, the nextgen console port recieved higher resolution textures, 60fps and 1080p support, but for us PC players that was standard back when we got the PC version of the original relase on X360/PS3, and Legendary Dark Knight mode is also something we already had on PC. Other than that, there is a slight numerical rebalance for moves, but everything else is still the same, well optimized lightspeed running and beautiful Sick Smokin' Style we came to know.\n\nWhy would you want to buy this then?\n\nBecause DMC4SE has absolutely MASSIVE amount of new content, if you play DMC games for what they should be played: replayability and perfecting your fighting techniques in overly increasing challanges. Now you have on top of the original protagonists, Dante and Nero, 3, I repeat THREE new characters, returning characters from the classics, and each of them have drasticly different new gameplay mechanisms that are guaranteed to give even the most diehard DMC4 players a lot new things to learn, experiment with and enjoy. They all have their own intros and outros, but the campign is the same 20 missions for all from the main game (so same as DMC3SE method). You can skip the 1-2-3 parts if you don't want to read about new characters.\n\n1. Vergil, the number one cold blooded honorable swordsman returns from DMC3SE with all his moves, plus about a dozen new ones, and a "focus" meter that translates to "how cold and badass you are meter". The less you move while an enemy is locked, the less unnecessary moves you make, the most perfect you play, this meter increases giving vergil a massive power boost (many of his moves even change when it's full), and you can pretty much wipe the screen with super judgement cut. He is insanely fast in both movement and diverse attacks, and yet the most powerful when you slow down and hold yourself back for the sake of being stylish.\n\n2. Lady a.k.a Mary from DMC3's story, who is playable for the first time in the franchise's history. She fights only with varios firearms, such as double pistols, shotgun and her signature bladed rocket launcher and granades. Her moves and fighting style are so different compared to any other playable DMC franchise character ever that she didn't only earn the most unique character title in the franchise rightfully, but also the fact that I as a veteran DMC player had to learn absolutely everything from the basics to play with her. Your whole style, positioning, the way you exploit weaknesses of various enemies, everything is so different she could have her own game.\n\n3. And last, everyone's teenage dream sexy demon, Trish. She is also playable for the first time, and uses electricity as static damaging "objects" in the game, drawing thunder in the air that stay there for a while and keeps hitting enemies, transforming each battle to more of an area control tactical battlefield, much like the reboot DmC. Sadly, most of her moves while function uniquely (that gold ball hitting combo with Sparda's transformed sword is hilarious, in a good way), sadly are reused animations from mainly Dante's moves.\n\nSo... basicly this is it. Compared to the old, original edition of DMC4, Special Edition also comes with various steamworks extras such as achievements, cloud saving, trading cards. If you have not bought DMC4 yet, definitly go for Special Edition. The replayability that these games are built for anyway, is so astoundingly increased I'm not even sure how to put that into my review. Doubled the playtime? Tripled? Quadrupled? Even more? Depends on how much you are into the other characters, but for the fans of DMC, this is the most vastly content packed game ever in the series.","April 3","true","29.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There’s lots to do here although it does lend itself to repeat plays to get the most from the experience. The first run through is a learning process before you can really let off some steam and shine with style. With no differences between the console and PC versions it doesn’t really matter which platform you choose as this is well worth the investment regardless. A solid game from 2008 just got better and although not up to par in looks compared to more modern games, the gameplay is rock solid and shows that graphics aren’t always indicative of all round fun. For its cheap price Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition comes highly recommended, although be warned of the puzzles which might need some external help to pass.\n\nScore 8.5/10\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6kDFRJis1M\n\n","June 26, 2015","true","13.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Nero on the other hand is such a bore, the whole affair loses its stupid charm and comes chrashing down again.\nNow, you can play through it with your mind on standby and go to  the good part very quickly, so that isn't exactly a dealbreaker. Though the Gyroblade puzzles were a really bad idea, but the developers wanted to show off the Devil-bringer, I get it.\nNow, how does the Special Edition hold up?\nExtremely well in my oppinion.\nThere is a lot of love in Vergil, Lady and Trish.\nVergil plays exactly as he did in DMC3 with a few additions that are very welcome. His focus mechanic fits him and his style very well (you lose focus whenever you miss an attack of take damage) and his weapons are his classic trinity (Yamato, Beowulf, Force Edge). If you like him in DMC3 you will like him here.\nTrish plays like she did in DMC2 with a few additional moves from her DMC1 days as an enemy. She uses lightning skills, similar to what she used back then, has Luce and Umbra as side arms and can also call Pandora. While she can't change weapons, her lightning strikes form lasting lines and it is challenging to position them so that enemies get caught and then butcher them.\nFinally, there is Lady.\nOk, she is the best addition imagineable. She play very differently from the others, since most of her skills are far range and she is slower than the others. To master her, you need to herd enemies and use her dashs and stuns to you can charge up your primary arms and SHOOT THEM WITH A BAZOOKA. Seriously though, her style is unique and fun to play and she is a great addition.\nMy verdict: Buy it if you liked DMC3. Dante, Vergil and Lady are a lot of fun to play and the other two are at least decent.","June 28, 2015","true","18.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rezen1337/recommended/329050/","rezen1337","rezen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rezen1337/","315 products in account","As a series, Devil May Cry boasts the most robust combat system of its genre, with Bayonetta and Ninja Gaiden as its largest modern competitors.\n\nWhere Bayonetta trumps the rest in visuals, level design, and world building, DMC does so with unparalleled depth of combat across all its playable characters; with the Special Edition released, along with 3 more, the hold on this claim doesn't fall.\n\nThis game is more of a standalone expansion to DMC4.  More than a remake, but less than a "GOTY" version.  While things have been added, nothing has been overhauled.  Characters are placed into scenes as needed, but not generally changed.  The new characters were not given their own unique campaigns.\n\nThe most important thing to note about this game, however, is that it is essentially incomplete, as the first half of missions are essentially repeated backwards with a second character for the second half of the game.  While it does not directly affect gameplay, the fact that this happens cannot be ignored.  Players coming to the series looking for an enlightening and well told story won't be pleased with what this has to give.  DMC3SE does this job much better, which is another story, and while it had revolutionary combat mechanics, eventually gets eclipsed by what this game has to offer.\n\nAnd that's where the game easily shines.  DMC4SE has 5 unique, playable characters that all boast different weapons playstyles, and mechanics.\n\nNero serves as a welcoming to newcomers, and a refreshing, yet challenging, change of pace for the more advanced and hardcroe crowd.  Trish joins the cast with abilities that mostly resemble Dante, but without such a dizzying amount.  Lady offers a different take on the melee-centric combat that the series is known for, keeping all the style, and dishing out just as much damage.  Vergil is rewarded for making calculated, meticulous play, but that doesn't keep him from looking cuhrayzee while doing so.\n\nDante boasts a total of 5 styles, 3 melee weapons, and 3 projectile weapons where 1 of each can be equipped at any time.  And any can be swapped for another at any time.  And his moveset changes with each swap.  It can get ridiculous, but that's the joy of playing him and any of the others.\n\nAt the end of the day, you'll be buying one of the greatest action franchises of all time--not for its narrative, but for its combat.  And, hell, any time Dante is on screen you'll probably have a fun time, anyway, so maybe a little for the narrative.  The game boasts ~6 difficulty levels and a Bloody Palace mode (where you progress through a series of floors that progressively more difficult toward the end).  You'll have plenty of time to try and master any one's style.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend the game purely because its mechanics are unrivaled throughout gaming.  The game challenges the best out of you, and when you're able to lay the smackdown on 20 of the most brutal enemies at the same time while throwing cheeky taunts and looking stylish all the same--the satisfaction is unreal.  The depth of DMC4SE's gameplay easily outshines its flaws, but it obviously can't go without mentioning.\n\n\n+Gameplay mechanics\n+Personality and style\n+Proper Difficulty Curve (both regarding progressing from one character to another, and game pacing)\n+Easy to learn, difficult to master\n+Replayability (probably requires a bit of dedication, which isn't hard if you get hooked)\n+Honestly looks beautiful\n\n-Level variance and design\n-Narrative progression\n-Each character does NOT get their own campaign (which was expected, but is worth putting down)\n\n8.5/10.  I'm tempted to make it a 9, but I'll put it this way--if the game were simply given a proper... well second half of levels, it'd easily be 10/10.  I personally feel the mechanics are enough to bring it to 9, but people definitely want to have that drive to play other than getting better, and that's where the story would come in.","June 29, 2015","true","89.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's not as good as DMC3, but it's not a bad game by any means. Devil May Cry 3 set the bar extremely high for the series, and Devil May Cry 4 tries to reach that bar but just falls a little short.  You play as Nero throughout most of the game and eventually play as Dante.\n\n\nIt's fun to play as Nero, he has the guns and swords similar to what Dante uses but more flashy. Neros' sword has a charge up attack that just does insane amounts of damage along with his devil arm which makes fighting most basic enemies a breeze. Nero is considered to be the "noob friendly" character to play as in the series since he is so easy to control and his devil arm makes him slightly overpowered. Dante however, is a completely different story. Dante plays a lot like he did in Devil May Cry 3 with the different fighting styles though trickster is the default style most people will get use to very fast.\n\n\nI've yet to play as Veril or Trish and Lady but adding those characters in to be playable, a new higher difficulty, slightly tweaked combat, and different costumes for your character makes this special edition version worth the price. The game is starting to show its age but it is still better than your average run of the mill hack and slash game. Definitely recommended to people wanting to try out the series and the veterans that can finish the entire game in one sitting.","June 29, 2015","true","9.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Everyone was expecting Vergil to be added, but having Lady and Trish in there is more than a bonus since neither are reskins, both entirely new characters.  I guess you could say Trish is a simplified version of Dante if you wanted to nitpick.\n\nOnly downside is that the new characters don't have more than two new cutscenes per campaign.  Which is fine.  I rather Itsuno-san and his team focus more on the gameplay of the new characters rather than their story.  This is Devil May Cry, light on story, heavy on gameplay.\n\nAlso as a fan that owns the previous versions (PS3/PC and the Special Edition on PS4) I'm glad Capcom has stuff like the Proud Souls and Red Souls for DLC.  I love this game, but I'm not about to grind through the game for a fourth time to get  all ablilities unlocked.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rikulightvsdark/recommended/329050/","rikulightvsdark","Dio Brando","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rikulightvsdark/","52 products in account","Devil May Cry 4 was a game I played directly after Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition, and despite some hating the character of Nero, I quite enjoyed him. His style was a mixture between the power of Dante and the speed of Vergil, with the Devil Bringer giving him more versatility than the two.\n\nHowever anyone who has played DmC 4 originally already knows this. Vergil, Trish, and Lady all maintain their own respective styles that cause of each of the new characters to be unique and have their own capabilities. In short, they are all fun and I enjoy playing as each of them and don't have a hatred of any of them. In long, for those who are curious as to how everyone plays, here you are:\n\nVergil: He plays similar to that of he did in DmC 3's Special Edition, he is a lot faster and weilds the same three weapons: Yamato (His Signature Blade), Foce Edge & Yamato in a combination, and Beowulf (Gauntlets and Boots similar to Dante's Gilgamesh) Each of these weapons are situational for whoever wishes to play, however a few things have changed. Yamato has grown a lot faster, and now you can buy different combos with it using proud souls, yet it maintains its base power of being capable of being the only weapon you use the entire game if you so wish.\n\nThe Force Edge and Yamato combination attacks are also a lot faster, and instead of using Yamato during the latter half he entirely uses the Force Edge throughout the combo unless you buy a new one. It is a lot more powerful on the ground than in the air, forcing you to resort to ground gameplay if you wish to use it effectively, however it still is a useful weapon if you so choose to use it.\n\nBeowulf is ripped straight out of Devil May Cry 3 combo-wise from Dante's perspective rather than Vergils. Other than the standard combo, he gains Dante's Thousand-Kick (at least that's what i call the combo) and Rising Dragon uppercut, as well as the Kick-13 from DmC 1. You can also now charge the attacks if you so wish.\n\nThe Main add-on of his gameplay is the Concentration Gauge. If you stay still while locked on to an enemy, land blows, or use his improved Air trick (which now is effectively Nero's Devil Bringer grab that sends Vergil Right to the enemy) it increases and the more it increases the stronger his attacks, however if you get hit, run, or miss attacks it will lower. (with getting hit effectively reducing it to almost nothing) When it is maxed out, he can use his ultimate attack (when you have purchased it) Judgement Cut with Yamato while it is maxed and you are in Devil Trigger, which effectively kills almost all normal enemies and devastates bosses. Overall he is fun to play if you enjoy the 'Speed Fighter' in video games.\n\nLady: Her gameplay rather than relying on melee weapons is almost entirely reliant on guns, (which is to be expected for anyone who has played DmC 3) the ones of choice being Dual Pistols, a Shotgun, or her Rocket Launcer Kalina Ann. Her melee gameplay is lackluster, however she makes up for it with exceptional ranged gameplay. Her Main combo's come from her pistols, while her true power comes from the shotgun and Kalina Ann. Instead of a standard Devil Trigger, her DT gauge is for a massive Area of Effect attack that deals great damage when you have a full DT gauge. Despite this she is still fun to play with, yet not as 'combo-riffic' as the other melee fighters. (Or at the very least I am not the best at Combo's using her guns)\n\nTrish: The 'Dante' of the Lady/Trish scenario, her 'tricks' instead are powerful attacks with the blade Sparda. An opposite to Lady, she relies heavily on a combination of fast Bare Knuckle strucks and powerful Sparda slashes. Flashy and powerful, her great might comes from using the combination effectively. One of her most damaging and (in my opinion) useful combinations coming from her throwing Sparda much like the Round-Trip attack from Force Edge/Rebellion in combination with a bare knuckle combination causing her to (as I call it) break-dance across the area, dealing massive damage to enemies around within the round-trip tornado, or deal damage to enemies who aren't caught it its destructive spin.\n\nOverall, the Special editions content of new Playable characters is entertaining to play, and in my opinion it was worth the re-release. The only downside is that they only have a different opening and closing cutscene, no other additional add-ons in that case. But for a Devil May Cry game, that has never truly mattered.

So lets move on to the Pros and Cons\n\nPros\nRemastered Gameplay.\nWeird slow-mo which i fixed by turning up refresh rate from 40 to 60\nRuns fairly good on a mid-tier GPU (I get nearly 60 FPS anywhere indoor and from 30 to 45 FPS in outdoor on High)\nVirgil is back and he is a all around badass\nTrish and Lady are now playable which add new combat styles.\nTweaked system like the rating system and money system.\nand much more\n\nCons\nThe remastered player models on some charecters make Virgil look like a hunk of painted rubber\nThe game has a 50/50 crash bug when you alt+tab\nif you dont crash on alt+tab and you return to the game youll need to turn off fullscreen and then turn it back on.\nThe game wont allow use of mouse on standard gameplay (can be fixed with autoHotkey Script which you can find on steam guides for DMC 4 original)\nAnd last but not least...... Micro-Transaction. Why o' Why must they do this. Im not gonna lie they seem kinda overpowered for the price (Ex. two dollars nets you 300,000 red orbs, three dollars nets you 5 blue orbs, five dollars gets you Dante, Vergil, and Neros Super outfits.)","June 23, 2015","true","32.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Legendary Dark Knight is also unlocked right off the bat, making it easy to grind for Proud Souls and Red Orbs, and each new character retains moves from older titles while giving a new breath into the game's style.\n\nTo put it simply, new fans or old, Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition caters to everybody.\n\nThe only down side is the level of detail - even high-end computers and laptops can encounter lag if there are too many enemies on screen. Toning down textures and the framerate can fix this, though.\n\nEDIT 9/2/2015: A friend of mine asked me for my input on the characters, so I'm amending my review to include my thoughts on the five Devil Hunters.\n\nNero\n\nPros:\n\n+ Jack-of-all-trades pistol. Keep it charged during a combo, then let the shot fly and turn an enemy into a suicide bomber. Even bosses flinch at its power!\n+ Devil Bringer. Pound enemies into the ground, throw them at other foes, or pummel them to death! Summoned Swords are optional.\n+ Red Queen. A sword that emphasizes range, so you can send crowds of enemies flying with a single Streak!\n+ Exceed System. Rev your sword like a motorcycle, and watch as your slashes speed up, lit with flame and sending you piercing through foes!\n\nCons:\n\n- Lack of evasive maneuvers. The closest moves he has to Trick and Air Trick require either something to grab, a close shave, or both.\n- No additional insight into his background. Is he truly a descendant of Sparda?\n- Incomplete Devil Trigger. Compared to Dante, Trish and Vergil, Nero's DT is only truly useful during bosses. He doesn't even get a second Super costume like in DMC3.\n\nDante\n\nPros:\n\n+ Three long-range weapons, four melee weapons, five styles. Switch from uppercuts to shockwaves to pistols to EXPLODING SWORDS AND ROCKETS in a instant!\n+ Distortion. Timing Devil Trigger with certain moves lets you stack damage to astronomical proportions. Devils may cry? Devils WILL cry!\n+ Incredible defensive and evasive moves. Master Trickster so your foes attack thin air, or max out Royalguard and laugh as demonic claws and fangs bounce harmlessly off of your body!\n\nCons:\n\n- Lack of evolution for Dark Slayer. Despite naming a style in honor of his brother, Dante only has barebones techniques for Yamato. Only really useful in conjunction with other attacks.\n- No additional non-style evasive techniques. Unless you take the time to master switching styles on the fly, Dante's ability to evade with Swordsmaster and Gunslinger is restricted to dodge-rolling and jumps.\n- Noticeable recovery times. Some of Dante's techniques are powerful, but on higher difficulties his flashier moves leave you vulnerable to attack due to their cooldown periods.\n\nLady\n\nPros:\n\n+ Upgradeable firearms. Her pistols, shotgun and Kalina Ann launcher combine the best of Nero and Dante's long-range moves from DMC3 and DMC4 with her own flair. Lady can use improved versions of Twosome Time, Shotgun Stinger, and many other Gunslinger techs!\n+ Kalina Ann. Yes, I mentioned it in the above paragraph, but it can be used as a nuke launcher, a homing missile launcher, and a rocket barrage! One-shot kill much?\n\nCons:\n\n- No Super costume. Capcom could have given her a Super form, with unlimited magic meter, auto-healing and faster charge times for her weapons, but didn't.\n- Little melee potential. While the KA has a blade attached, Lady doesn't build on it. Her basic melee moves have to be bought just like other characters, but can't be upgraded further. If you're fighting enemies in close quarters, you'll have a hard time unless you use your guns.\n\nMixed:\n\n+/- Burst Attack. I understand that she can't use Devil Trigger, and the Burst Attack makes for a great countermeasure or crowd sweeper, but it's relatively small for an AOE move. There also isn't an option to convert damage dealt from Burst Attack into health, again something which could have worked for a Super costume, so you're restricted to healing via Green Orbs and items. For those of us who like No Item runs, it's a real pain-in-the-***.\n\nTrish\n\nPros:\n\n+ SWORD OF SPARDA! Hell yes! She can use every form Dante used in the first DMC - sword, axe, and scythe!\n+ A wide arrange of melee moves. When she has the sword, she can kick opponents silly. When Sparda is doing its own thing, she can kick and punch with the rest of 'em. She can even utilize lightning to use Just-Charged variations of her attacks, making her a force to be reckoned with.\n+ Pandora. While those moves need to be bought before they can be used, her Pandora attacks have better range than Dante's. Epidemic goes three times as far, Hatred has increased range and splits into three directions, and Revenge fires an electricity-powered laser that stops ANY non-boss foe in their tracks! Even the Savior will flinch if you manage to pull it off!\n\nCons:\n\n- Like Lady, Trish suffers from a lack of advanced evasive abilities. Besides her dodge roll, her jump can be upgraded into a damage-dealing attack that also functions as a counter. Cheap, tricky to time and not very useful in higher difficulties.\n- No Super costume. Really, does this need an explanation?\n- Little development for range. Her guns have no charge shot, she's restricted to three of Pandora's forms, and charging Overdrive to max leaves her a sitting duck, even with Devil Trigger active.\n\nMixed:\n\n+/- As Trish or Gloria, she is incredible eye candy. You can decide the pros and cons for this yourself.\n\nVergil\n\nPros:\n\n+ Cross-universal techniques. Vergil uses moves from both DMC3 AND the reboot DmC: Devil May Cry, capitalizing on his speed while expanding his moveset from DMC3.\n+ Expanded Summon Swords. In addition to Blistering Swords and Spiral Swords, you have a faster rate of fire, a stronger Sword Storm, and a new technique: Heavy Rain Swords, which allows you to stop enemy movements with a shower of swords. Even bosses stop in their tracks!\n+ Incredible evasion. Nearly every evasive technique involves teleporting. Need to dodge to the side? Teleport. Need to close the distance between you and an enemy? Teleport. Need a faster substitute for Air Hike that can be used with Wall Kick for a triple jump? Teleport!\n+ Easy to refill DT. If you give Vergil time to sheathe Yamato after certain attacks, you recharge a full DT rune as well as increase the Style Meter. Some of his attacks require DT, so the ability to quickly charge DT without using items is a real boon!\n\nCons:\n\n- NO defensive ability. Because Vergil's focus is on precise strikes while evading your foes, you have no means of defending yourself besides using DT for health recovery and increased resistance to stagger.\n- No Air Hike. Air Trick is good, but unlike DMC3 Vergil can't move horizontally after using it to gain air. This isn't a problem once you've fully upgraded his weapons, but on harder modes and Bloody Palace...prepare to be grounded.\n- Very easy to drain DT. If you love Summoned Swords techniques, DT will drain FAST. Use it with Devil Trigger, and you'll pretty much be in DT for less than three seconds.\n\nHope this helps people.

Along with the three extra characters, some bugs have been fixed and the drop rate for Proud Souls and Red Orbs (Items used to enhance your characters) has been more than doubled from the original. And if you for some reason don't like the changes, you can enter a code that restores the balance of the original version, while still having access to the new characters and costumes.\n\nAll three of the new characters play far, -far- differently than Nero and Dante, and Vergil plays a bit differently than he did in DMC3, but not in a bad way - He has a few unique mechanics and far more options.\n\nThe graphics have been improved noticably, making the game look even better, which is a feat considering how well the original aged graphically.\n\nThe Bad: The enhanced graphics do terrible things to the framerate, or so everyone thinks - Framerate in general is a crapshoot, some people with PCs better than mine are getting worse FPS than I am, and a few with -worse- PCs are somehow getting better. Most people are blaming this on a few of the new graphical effects, which most people don't seem to like anyway.\n\nIt's not even that the framerate is -bad- as much as it is DMC4 was known for being absurdly optimized to the point where modern laptops with built in graphics chips could set all of the settings to max and still get 60+.  I can't claim to have a very good PC, but even I was getting 120+ FPS, and that's with a rather outdated, low-tier when it came out video card.\n\n\nIf you're already a fan of the series, and you don't have an XBOX ONE or PS4 to play this on, the PC version will work, it's still really fun even with the awkward performance. I should note that none of these issues seem to happen on the console version, and the game has been out for PC for less than 24 hours as of me writing this, so there's hope that Capcom will be able to patch these issues.","June 24, 2015","true","25.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game brings back those memories, and with 3 additional characters + Legendary Dark Knight mode it's well worth the 25€ I put in.

I am a bit disappointed with the fact that Capcom wasted the opportunities to add new levels or a new campaign, and I would've liked to see more cutscenes with conversations for the new characters. The current cutscenes (at least with Vergil) involve little dialog (e.g. before boss fights), and don't have a lot of depth or things to make you even chuckle.\n\nOtherwise, great game so far for the money, 8/10","June 23, 2015","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Playing as Vergil was one of my favorite things in DMC3. And to play him again in DMC4? Well my excitment was through the roofs. I pre-ordered the game and played it on the day of its launched.\n\nHowever, the game didn't live up to my expectations, why? Well first I'll start with Vergils campaign - there is none. Granted I'm still at Mission 07, and this could be subject to change. But when you start the game, you recieve a cutscene stating that the game takes place decades before the original DMC4 would. The cutscene then goes on to Vergil being badass by slaying demons. After he kills them all a crowd comes out and passes him, with one random female looking his way after he walks by. What happens next? Absolutely nothing. There are no cutscenes, there is no plot. Hell, even the map doesn't change despite the game taking place decades before the original game.\n\nWhich proceeds to my next complaint. All the levels are customized as if they were still for Nero. There are some objects that you're meant to use Devil Bringer to obtain. Yet you can not, as Vergil is unable to reach them. For example in Mission 06. When you first enter the underground level. You'll see a Vital Star on the other end of the pathway. Which you can not reach due to an invisible wall. And while I'm on the topic of Mission 06. The first Agnus boss fight where you need to break the glass that seperates you from him. Normally you'd use Devil Bringer to chuck Gladius demons at the glass. With Vergil? You just wail on the glass until it breaks. If there's another way, please inform me.\n\nNow I know Capcom never promised Vergil to have his own story line nor have they commented on it, but the opening cutscene is a bit of a tease. But all-in-all, would I recommend this game? Yes, that is if you love Vergil. Right now I'm enjoying stringing his combos together and feeling awesome while doing it. And after this I can't wait to go through with Lady and Trish, then finally Dante and my all around favorite character - Nero.

However the release of Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition definitely sees a revitalization with the series we've all come to know and love.\n\nThis title is loaded with bonus content that ranges from additional replayability in the form of new characters all the way to artwork. By far the most anticipated feature in the game is the ability to play as Dantes twin brother, Vergil. Speaking from personal experience as a seasoned DMC veteran, I can confidently say that Vergil is an absurdly powerful character, but simple game mechanics hide the true depth of his gameplay.\n\nIn addition to Vergil, Trish reappears as a playable character and Lady makes her debut here. Trish is a much more control oriented character, using the Sparda to keep enemies at bay or pull them in, and her lightning attacks stagger enemies in place allowing her to land some heavy shots. Lady on the other hand, being a human, relies on her gunplay to get the job done. Wielding dual model 1911 pistols, a shotgun and her trademark rocket launcher Kalina Ann, Lady can keep enemies at bay with relative ease before blowing them to kingdom come with a barrage of missiles. You would think that a character with little to no melee attacks has no place in the DMC family, but rest assured, Lady is just as Stylish as the rest of them.\n\nWhile the new characters are a nice breath of fresh air, the overall game itself leaves a little to be desired. Even with the updated graphics, there are no new levels to the campaign, and some (including myself) might feel a little shafted that Vergil, Lady and Trish do not have separate campaigns all their own, complete with all new levels and possibly enemies.\n\nIn the end, what we have is a true Devil May Cry game with loads of bonus stuff to do and play around with. Just like DMC3SE before it, the game adds very little when it comes to new game modes and a lack of new levels, but the sheer amount of content that is laden within this game far outweighs the sins that it can possibly commit.\n\nI highly reccomend this title to any and all gamers.","June 26, 2015","true","51.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is really, really enjoyable, especially for a Special Edition/remastering of a game. In all honesty, I'm enjoying this much more than I enjoyed Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition. Improved graphics, 3 new characters (which aren't just carbon copies of other characters, by the way [aside from a couple of recycled moves, but they fit in perfectly with each character's moveset, Vergil has a move from DMC3 that Dante uses!]), and a couple of new cutscenes. Vergil is absolutely overpowered, but he's fun as hell to play as (while still being a little bit broken). Worth the 25 dollars. Seriously, if you're thinking of getting DMC4, spend the extra five bucks and go with the Special Edition. You won't regret it.\n\nHowever, this game isn't really optimized for lower-end graphics cards (unlike DMC4, which can pretty much run on a toaster), so you might have some issues getting 60fps if your card isn;t that great. I used to be able to run DMC4 at nearly 900fps. Now I'm barely passing 180.

The ammount of gameplay content is very high the best in the series based on its unique gameplay hours that u can spend on 5 different characters, some old and some new. This is the DMC 4 Special Edition, the HD remastering of the hit 2008 DMC 4 game that featured a new character nero alongside the franchise champion Dante. This time though in special edition Capcom has added 3 new playable character 2 the game, 2 of which (Lady and Trish) were already part of the DMC 4 storyline but werent playable, and the other is non other than fan favourite vergil. Vergil features new moves than that featured in DMC 3 Special edition, not to mention all 3 characters have their own openings and endings (with trish and lady sharing the cutscene :D ).\n\nNow about the gameplay :\nThose who know the DMC series will find this to be really satisfying to play and master. Each new characters feature tonnes of new gameplay mechanic and combos that makes the returning DMC 4 players something to look forward at. Vergil especially has been reimagined properly in terms of his gameplay. He is far more satisfying than the DMC 3 vergil although this vergil shares the same model (HD textures) of the DMC 3 vergil.\nLady brings a whole new style to the DMC franchise, ranged gameplay, her ranged offensive power play is really fun to play as considering she's the only character who doesnt have a DT so health is really a problem as u dont have any regeneration from DT unlike other characters. Trish is also fun and features massive area of effect damage play style than others  good for the Legendary dark knight modes hordes of enemies.\n\nPerformance\nI run a decent system that can run most games in average graphics and DMC 4 SE didnt trouble me at all in terms of performance . Considering it to be a remastered 2008 game i didnt expect to cause problems other than few game crashes here and there as i alt+tab or steam chat (its weird) .\n\nTL/DR\nreally great game coming from DMC series, tonnes of gameplay hours for those hard core gamers. Pretty much same enemies and bosses other than new playable characters (Vergil/Lady/Trish) there is no other change. The game saves Automatically which saves lot of buttong presses and precious time :D. 2-3 additional skins for all playable characters (counting the pre-order bonus skin).\n\nWould recommend this for any hack and slash fan, especially to a DMC fan :D","June 26, 2015","true","36.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The 3 new characters in the Special Edition totalling 5 characters allow for many combo options and fighting styles. It's an amazing game if you're in it for an extremely deep combat system. However, the game is lackluster in most other departments.\n\nThe story is just ok. The original release was made revolving around Nero and Dante, and the Special Edition hasn't seen any additional plot development; if you're looking for stories for these new characters, there aren't any. They feel more like DLC characters. The new characters have cutscenes at the beginning and end of the game, but that's it. The level design is exactly the same for all the characters across the board, so it gets repetitive. You won't find any additional levels or bosses unique to the characters you play.\n\nWhat the Devil May Cry series has always done well is definitely here in the gameplay. The games are meant to be repetitive to exploit more and more patterns with each playthrough. With plenty of difficulties, characters, enhancements like making the game 20% faster, and a horde mode with 101 waves, the game becomes what you make of it. In terms of differences between Devil May Cry 4 and the Special Edition, there isn't much aside from the characters and enhancements to the game engine and graphics. But, if you feel like being a badass, this game definitely delivers.","January 22","true","31.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The three new characters are fun to play and are pretty unique from Dante and Nero, which was nice. Lady is probably my personal favorite of the added characters, with the focus on ranged combat feeling the most fresh gameplay wise. The new game modes are also welcome, providing additional challenges for experienced players. All the characters also have a bunch of costumes to unlock, which is always fun. I was a bit disappointed that the new characters didn't get their own music or separate set of levels, but I can't complain too much in light of everything they did add.\n\nOn the technical side of things, the game is pretty well optimized. It runs at a solid 60fps fairly reliably, it never seemed to drop below that even with a ton of enemies on screen at once. Graphically the game looks pretty great, although I'm not sure what was all "enhanced" specifically. Granted, it has been quite a while since I played the original version, so I may have just simply forgotten what it used to look like.\n\nOverall it's a great game, I had a lot of fun coming back to it. Gameplay wise its one of the most refined and solid action games I've played, and it still holds up pretty well. With the added features you get a pretty good amount of content for the price (five characters, seven difficulty modes, and bloody palace) compared to most similar games. If you're a newcomer to the series it's not a bad place to start either, since none of the games are strongly tied to each other. Highly recommended.\n","July 6, 2015","true","31.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Trish as we all know came with Dante on his first visit so I saw nothing wrong with that other then using Dantes part of the story to fill in the gaps and Lady was pretty much replaces Nero's part of the story with no real changes.\n\n\nCombat I find to be flawless with combos and possibilitys in fighting styles, Lady has her guns and trademarked rocket launcher while Trish uses the Dark Knight Spardas sword and magic capabilitys, Vergil also comes with his trademark weapon Yamato along with Beowulf a punching and kicking weapon taken from DMC3 as well as his Force Edge sword that gives you almost the same style as Dante with his Rebellion.\n\nThing's to do would be the main story of course on whatever difficulty, Human(Easy), Devil Hunter(Medium), Son of Sparda(Hard), Dante Must Die(Very Hard), Heaven and Hell(1 hit kill on either you or the enemy so take that as what you will), Hell and Hell (Just a plain old nightmare) and my fave Legendary Dark Knight(Pretty much Dante must die with a hell of a lot more enemys at one given time).\n\nBloody Palace mode has also made a comeback with 101 floors and a boss at every 20 floors, makes for a good time and to learn the characters moves and combos, if you have played Bloody Palace before then you already know but to thoughs that don't. Bloody Palace is a floor based mode where you defeat all enemys on that floor to proceed with bosses jumping in from the story at ever 20th floor(20, 40, 60, 80, 100) and Dante being on the very last floor at 101, the higher you go the more hard it get's(so if you think you had a hard time with Creedo or Dante on normal to hard then boyyyy you about to have some fun). You're also timed on this mode but I do believe you can turn the time off (I may be mistaken) but turning it off will also make it so you can't get the achivments for completeing in under 2 hours or beating Bloody Palace(Again maybe wrong). It is worth a play through to test yourself as it does help to learn the combos making this the perfect place to learn, one downside though is you have to unlock this mode by beating the games Story on Devil Hunter mode.\n\nGraphics have definatly been given a boost as the game on very high looks beautiful, it runs smooth and the optamization is great, it also has a preformance check so you can see what frames you are about to be running( I have some Screen Shots of this)\n\nDLC: I honestly don't mind that you can do this for this game as it's just a pay to skip type deal when it comes to the diificultys so you don't have to go through each to unlock the next but it's whatever to the ones that do.\nThe extra outfits for Trish and Lady is up to you but I wouldn't really bother as the Gloria outfit is a bit ugh to me.\nNow the Super Nero/Dante/Vergil(Permernant DT for all three and always maxed guages for Nero and Vergil) is something that can also be unlocked in the game so is also a pay to skip deal only thing about it is if you was planning to go through the game with super characters and get that final S rating, you will be disapointed( S for style, time and orbs, still gave me a B rating) but it's fair as it's more for the after you done just show everything how OP you can really be type fun which is a great addition.\n\nAll in all if you're a hack and slash lover or a DMC fan like me, I would pick this up and would give a solid 7.5/10\nonly because of the lack of Story for one of the best DMC Characters ever in a area people that would have liked to know more about.","July 7, 2015","true","26.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However, If you haven't purchased the original DMC4, and look for a adrenaline-filled hack-and-slash, this is a game for you. Even the difficulty is the same as before - well, somewhat.\n\nYou might be wondering, why am I dissapointed to this to this game, since my reason for it is the content. Well, allow me to explain:\nFirst off, while the new characters bring new life to the game, all they did they created them. Capcom didn't even bother making new levels, new bosses. Nothing new was made. Trish, Lady and Vergil's mechanics sure all solid, but my interest well apart at the time I had run my first playthrough as Vergil. If you have watched the intro of Vergil, you can hear the soundtrack playing in the background that highly resembles the second fight against Vergil in DMC3. THIS SONG AINT HEARD ANYWHERE ELSE. The only ones you hear as Vergil are the themes of Nero, Dante, and the boss fights.\n\nBesides of music, the missions.. they ain't different in anyway. You will encounter same enemies in same missions in same places as in the original, Nero/Dante story. Even when starting the story of Lady/Trish, It could have began outside of the Devil May Cry.\n\nHowever, even with these complaints, I recommend those to purchase this game if they don't already own the original version. If you do own the original, I'd consider buying this when it comes out for sale.\n\nWell.. you can always buy this game because it has Vergil.... Right? Don't get cocky.\n\n","March 19","true","19.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, If you haven't purchased the original DMC4, and look for a adrenaline-filled hack-and-slash, this is a game for you. Even the difficulty is the same as before - well, somewhat.\n\nYou might be wondering, why am I dissapointed to this to this game, since my reason for it is the content. Well, allow me to explain:\nFirst off, while the new characters bring new life to the game, all they did they created them. Capcom didn't even bother making new levels, new bosses. Nothing new was made. Trish, Lady and Vergil's mechanics sure all solid, but my interest well apart at the time I had run my first playthrough as Vergil. If you have watched the intro of Vergil, you can hear the soundtrack playing in the background that highly resembles the second fight against Vergil in DMC3. THIS SONG AINT HEARD ANYWHERE ELSE. The only ones you hear as Vergil are the themes of Nero, Dante, and the boss fights.\n\nBesides of music, the missions.. they ain't different in anyway. You will encounter same enemies in same missions in same places as in the original, Nero/Dante story. Even when starting the story of Lady/Trish, It could have began outside of the Devil May Cry.\n\nHowever, even with these complaints, I recommend those to purchase this game if they don't already own the original version. If you do own the original, I'd consider buying this when it comes out for sale.\n\nWell.. you can always buy this game because it has Vergil.... Right?

The gameplay is similar to that of DMC3, albeit a bit slower and overall simpler. Same explosive action as bayonetta, if you enjoyed Bayonetta: You will enjoy this. The game looks like it would be a button masher but in reality the combat takes actual skill, similar to that of Dank Souls or God Hand(if you play on very high difficulties).

See info","http://steamcommunity.com/id/docofdailydose/","168 products in account","I really wanted to like this game. I came in with high hopes and prayed to the holy trinity, seven layers of hell, the Norse gods, the Roman gods, the Greek gods, and even ♥♥♥♥ing Yahweh. Turns out that one of them decided I was a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and deserved to be sad. I bet it was Thor.\n\nTangent aside. This is literally Devil May Cry 4, but with Vergil and two mediocre characters. If you're a Vergilfriend, then by all means buy this game. You should get $25 worth of enjoyment.\n\nThat reminds me. Apparently, if you already bought the vanilla version, you still pay the full price for this barely-touched rerelease. Capcom, are you even trying? This is depressing on your collective part.\n\nThe gameplay itself is unchanged for the original two heroes, Nero and Dante. They didn't even bother to give them anything besides a new costume. I am not exaggerating. However, they have one leg up over the new three: a story. That's right, Vergil and Lady/Trish, the latter two being their own campaign like Nero/Dante, have no justification for why they're there besides the opening and ending. Vergil's story takes place long ago, and just serves to imply he's Nero's dad with his ending of, SPOILER ALERT, his shadow resembling Nero's Devil Trigger. Wow, it's nothing. Meanwhile, for Lady/Trish, they just tagged along with Dante. Well, okay, that is kind of implied in the main story so that's okay. However, the main gripe I have is they don't get cutscenes like Nero/Dante. For new enemies and bosses, it just shows them and the foes before putting you back in the game. It's lazy and insulting.\n\nThe new characters are underwhelming, frankly. Vergil is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ strong and it shows that Capcom just threw him in with all these toys without thinking about balance, if you're a whiner about that. I'm thankful for this, but he still needs way too much effort for S ranking it up. And if you're not getting S ranks, there's no point at all to playing this game. Why do okay when you should be doing perfect? Checkmate atheists. No offense to atheists.\n\nLady and Trish, on the other hand, are insulting. Lady is basically Dante's Gunslinger style and has some rockin' guns. And I don't just mean her handguns, shotgun, and Kalina Ann. Fun to watch, not fun to play. Trish, however, is just a weakened Dante with no switching. She's basically the dump character for Capcom.\n\nBesides the much less optimized engine, nothing else changed. There is nothing on the PC version that is worth mentioning. Sure, there's Turbo mode, but that's it. It'll just make you get hit more, and why would you want to break your combos? Those things are already few and far between. Plus, the new battle themes aren't even properly implemented. Yes, Vergil, Lady, and Trish have themes but you're just going to hear Nero and Dante's themes because why would Capcom make a good decision?\n\nOh yeah, optimization. DMC4 could play on an N-Gage. DMC4SE, not so much. While my computer's fairly strong, I've heard some horror stories about the framerates.\n\nIn short, this game is not worth a buy, especially if you already bought DMC4. Just play DMC3SE.","August 11, 2015","false","5.3"," 60 of 121 people (50%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","50","60","121","10","0"

Tiny gameplay tweaks have been added to get rid of annoyances and make the game even better. Welcoming to newcomers as well as difficult enough to challenge the veterans. The only major flaw I could point out is the in game purchases to make the game easier. You can buy in game currency as well as buy powered up versions of characters to blaze through the game with minimal effort. Though it's completely optional it's still there.

The new engine also cuts the framerate in half almost, while the original could push 200-300fps on a Radeon 7950 and I see drops (nothing serious, just below 120) on an R9 Fury X in this version.\n\nSo yeah, cons:\n-Unnecessary new engine\nPros:\n+The same DMC4 you know and love\n+Three(!) new characters\n+Additional modes\n+A glimmer of hope that Capcom might once again commit to the main series instead of the awful reboot\nEh:\n+Graphics are sort of better - a handful of shaders are improved and there's light beams","February 28","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And I mean the REAL Devil May Cry 5. Not the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reboot.) I hope all old Devil May Cry fans buy this and try it out.

With 3 extra characters to play as you'll spent twice as long if you are revisiting the series.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/red_sozin/recommended/329050/","red_sozin","Vale Defender","http://steamcommunity.com/id/red_sozin/","99 products in account","Before early gameplay leaks and reveals it was my intention to only experience the gameplay myself, and I failed on that front. Because of previews my expectations were extraordinarily low. Vergil looked overpowered and simple to play in every regard while Lady and Trish both looked to be only moderate potential at best with loose options and pure fundamentals respectively. As soon as I started playing, thankfully, my preconceptions were crushed.\n\nVergil:\n\nThe very first thing I discovered starting with Vergil is that you have to commit to your attacks more than you would expect because jumping out of them requires much greater timing. This is good. Overall, Vergil is much, MUCH stiffer than his 3SE counterpart and demands you adopt an entirely new, more conservative playstyle than you'd be used to in any previous game except maybe DMC1. Trick's invincibility frames have been shortened considerably so it's no longer the easy perfect dodge button and because you trick to enemies by shooting a summoned sword, tricking too often is more likely to get you hit because you're more likely to hit a nearby enemy with a projectile than one outside of the range of the attack you intend to dodge. On the opposite side of this, many of your lengthier moves can be canceled by tricking so it balances out in speed. Potentially, 4SE's Vergil is much stronger than 3's, but at a base level he's much harder to play that well without spamming.\n\nLady:\n\nHeavily recommended that shooting/charging your gun be put on something other than the face button, I suggest swapping Square/X and R2/Right Trigger. It's also the configuration I use for Dante (With Sword switch put on Left Trigger instead). With this setup you're able to attack and charge your guns simultaneously to keep combat more active. Lady is very heavy damage with a bit of the same conservative, defensive playstyle. Meaning several of her moves aren't easily cancelled. Her equivalent to Devil Trigger allows you to break any of these animations, but doesn't function like a Devil Trigger. Instead, you get a large window of invulnerability along with a circle of grenades that does damage on par with DT Explosion from 3, draining the enitre meter in the same fashion. Her playstyle makes up for this and a lack of melee combat by being very mobile depending on what you're shooting with. Handguns charge for brust and delayed damage like Nero's Blue Rose and the second most mobile gun provided you compensate for recovery animations and end your rapid pressing early. Shotgun charged behaves like Coyote-A; Gunstinger is a great move that even hits if you end up on the opposite side of your enemy and allows for some close dodges. Kalina Ann seems to be the weakest of the bunch in terms of potential combos but grapple does its job and its moves are high damage. It's even more important to know your enemies as Lady than Vergil.\n\nTrish:\n\nMy prediction turned out to be correct about Trish, in that she's moderate potential with heavy and exaggerated fundamentals. From the perspective of someone who loves the franchise and picks apart every little detail, she's boring. That said, Trish is by far the best thing for beginners in this game and people need to be able to play her through the entire story without switching. Trish's weapons are the tried and true "Sword and Fist" combination all the way from DMC1. Unlike DMC1, or even other characters in this game, she has both simultaneously on two different face buttons. Fists function similarly to how they always have and Sparda brings along one of the major teachers of juggling: Round Trip. While Sparda is active away from you, your fists' directional input attacks are altered and its combos extended, allowing for overall fantastic crowd control. I can't stress enough how good this character is for people too stubborn to play the first game, despite it being the hardest and most complete in the franchise.","June 23, 2015","true","26.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game was great and even as an "advanced casual gamer" you could finish the hardest missions with the best results.\n\nNow i also bought the special edition but i have to say it feels different (minor spoilers ahead!):\n\n- Although i know how the game works I cannot dodge 50% of enemy attacks but it is absolutely essential for the game to dodge enemy attacks. (For example: 2 Frosts attack me, I fight one of them with a Yamato-combo and can see the other prepare to launch ice-bolts in the background. Of course I try to evade the attack but Vergil takes ages to interrupt the combo and start doing jumping/air tricks. Nero and Dante feel a bit slower, too. I don't know about Trish and Lady because i haven't played them yet.)\n- It feels like the producer put Vergil in Nero's and Dante's place during the missions without even adapting the Style-ranking to Vergil's abilities. I tried to fight Dante in SoS-mode in Mission 1 but it is impossible to get a better Style rank than C (most of the time it was D). Nero on the other hand just grabs Dante with his Devil Buster and instantly gets a C or B rank during battle. It feels like the producer didn't even try to get S ranks for the missions and see if it is doable with Vergil (for advanced players at least).\n- Some achievements are a pain in the ***. Get an S-rank in every mission in Human-mode although you already did that in Devil Hunter-mode or do the Bloody Palace 5 freaking times! It's just a waste of time for achievement farmers.\n- Vergil has no double-jump nor evasion moves to get away from the enemy (unless you are transformed into a devil). In DMC 3 he had trick down to get away from enemies. Why abandon that ability? Terrible decision.\n\n+ 3 new characters that feel really different from each other (Lady and Trish look like fun in some internet videos).\n+ A few new costumes come with the game.\n+ Playing as Vergil is really cool unless you get hit by 50% of the attacks.\n+ A few new cutscenes for the new characters, but nothing special really.\n+ Collecting Orbs and stuff with one character counts as collected with all others (For example: Collect all blue orbs with Nero/Dante. Then you start the Vergil campagin and he already has all lifebars.)\n+ No real problems with the controller adaption.\n\nI downvote this game because it is too expensive for the newly added content and the really, really bad Style ranking system and missing evasion moves of Vergil. I will change it once it is cheaper or fixed. (English isn't my mother tongue, hope you understood it)\n\nEdit:\n- Trish and Lady campaign is the easy mode. Lady builds up style with guns so she never has to get close to enemies. Trish has a lot of crowd control attacks and a laser beam that deals massive damage to bosses. Really easy gameplay.\n- Some enemies are infected with parasytes. When the parasyte starts attacking you cannot get close to the enemy. The parasytes attacking every 4 seconds for approx. 3 seconds. I have 4 seconds to attack the enemy and then i have to get away from them again and wait for another 3 seconds. Only option to fight them are attacks from the distance but these attacks do not improve your style. Terrible anti-DMC gameplay, no fun at all.","July 26, 2015","false","60.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

DMC4SE is thus a huge letdown after brilliantly ported DMC4 and I can´t stress enough how disappointing it is when you can´t even change the resolution from 1280x720 to anything else because it constantly crashes. No patch was released to remedy that and developer support is almost nonexistent now.\n\nIf you have a laptop, avoid this version at all cost! I really hope they will fix it in the future, but somehow I don´t think that will happen, which is a huge shame. The game itself is fun and enjoyable (albeit still worse than DMC3), if you are into hack´n´slash genre. There is a certain amount of repetition after half of the game (reusing the same levels, really?), but at least you get to play as Dante as well.\n\nPS: The addition of Vergil, Lady and Trish is awesome!

Now the original DMC4 seemed to have been coded using some sort of magic fairy dust that miraculously made it perhaps one of the most well optimized games of all time, it ran on literal toasters. Now I expected that the SE would make a few graphical updates and to be fair it does - but nothing too great - and thus it is a reasonable assumption to make that the performance would be fairly similar to the original. However most people seem to be running the game at almost half the framerate that they could the original and this is not acceptable. Especially for people such as myself with very low-end machines who could comfortably run the orignal at around 90fps and now have to make do with an uncomfortable 40fps (thats right for a lot of people the game runs at less than the almsot necessary 60fps!) The main cause for this as far as I can tell is that PC port was made by Access Games as opposed to Capcom themselves, who took the liberty to a add a variety of awful bloom and blur and some arguably unnecessary post-processing effects which tank the performance and in some instances make the game look worse than the original - AND CANNOT BE REMOVED THROUGH THE OPTIONS MENU! If you run a low-end rig then save your money and stay away from this frustrating port.\n\nNow with that said and done, if you do have a computer that can run the game at 60+fps, then please by all means by this game and support the series , so that one day we may see a DMC5 (as opposed to a dreaded DmC2). The game itself is fantastic, fast paced and fun - and the three new characters are unique and interesting to use (although due to poor optimization I could never experience them in their full glory).","June 24, 2015","false","7.7"," 26 of 58 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","26","58","2","1"

It's Devil May Cry 4, except good. No, really; the concepts are there, but actually developed: the main character isn't muscled out of her own series by an embarrassing, poorly-designed stand-in, and you get to control a demon-touched protagonist against angelic foes whose bizarre religion controls a largely isolated city.\n\nIf 'anime' were a singular style -- which it isn't, but if it were -- Devil May Cry 4 would be a prime example, a poster child, of that style. It tries so hard to be everything you'd expect from an upmarketed, glossy, designed-for-consumption experience that it forgets what made Devil May Cry any good in the first place. The first three games? Increasingly good! Some will whine about 2 being different, but most of them are sheeple. The plain fact of the matter is that all of them performed well, and 3 was probably the fan favorite of the whole series. So what do you do when a game basically embodies everything people love about the series?\n\nIf you're Capcom, you throw away what they liked and make something you for some reason believe they'll embrace despite that. They did it with the humiliating DmC, and they did it here.\n\nDante is shoved aside by newcomer Nero, who is basically a bland, unlikeable cardboard cutout of a protagonist. You will know his entire story by seeing five minutes of it. No, really. There is nothing about him that is original or surprising. He feels like the hero of some just-serviceable fanfiction. He's not fun to play, he's painful to watch and listen to, and 4's story is best forgotten utterly and brushed under the rug.\n\nBut you aren't here for that. You're here for the Special Edition, which adds new things! Vergil, Lady, and Trish playable, and more! Is it worth it?\n\nIn short, no, not really.\n\nDevil May Cry 4 is a clunky game with a bad plot that's hard to enjoy. Even though I admittedly skip the cutscenes now -- sitting through them once, years ago, was enough -- none of the extra characters actually has any real story of their own, and they're lucky to get even one cutscene. There's a premise, but then they're put into exactly the same stages as Nero and Dante are, with exactly the same situations. It's a big yawn, and it's a big shame, mainly because the level design in this game is also pretty poor; you spend your time advancing with Nero, and then once you finally get to play as Dante, basically the other half of the game is backtracking.\n\nSo if you wanted to do that with Lady and Trish, congratulations! Your dream has come true. Get this game immediately if that's the case. The same is true with Vergil, though he's alone in his mode. For some reason. So if you wanted at least half a game of backtracking -- congrats! Here it is.\n\nOkay, okay, so I have to admit that Trish, Lady, and Vergil are fun to play as. This is the first time Lady's really playable, and she's a blast...no pun intended. Trish returns to playable and she's a joy. Vergil's playable again.\n\nBut in all honesty, it just makes me think of the games where you could play as them and have a bit more fun. Trish was unlockable in 2 and a lot of fun in it. Vergil was playable in 3's Special Edition. They're both better and more enjoyable games than 4, and they feel far more distinctive than the samey kind of high-gloss, low-substance experience that 4 gives you.\n\nI got this to support the release so that maybe, just maybe, Capcom will get the message that we want to see more Devil May Cry, with Dante, Trish, and Lady, and less of the humiliating and inexplicable attempt at a redux they tried. I'm not going to hold my breath, though, since Capcom are notorious for handling franchises poorly and especially being contemptuous towards fans.\n\nI really can't recommend it to anyone who isn't trying to support the actual Devil May Cry. If you want to play better games in the series, get the HD collection of Devil May Cry 1-3. If you want to play a better game in general, get Bayonetta. It essentially takes the basic elements of Devil May Cry 4 and makes them an engaging, enjoyable, fun experience that you will find memorable and a classic of modern gaming.\n\nAs for Devil May Cry 4, it's just not a good game. It's not terrible, but it's easily the least enjoyable in the 1-4 series, and it has the least amount of character and interest to it. It's just a bland exercise in going though the motions, and the Special Edition's extras don't really add anything to that or make it much better.\n\nGive it a miss, unless you just really want to have this game on your PC for some reason, or feel like buying it may send Capcom a message that they need to get back to the roots of what made the series great. 4 isn't what made it great, but at least it had the actual Dante in it, along with his supporting cast, even if he was pushed out of the spotlight temporarily by some derpy twerp with a lazily similar character design.","December 23, 2015","false","5.6"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

Are we all seriously going to pretend the slingshot grapple nonsense, the stupid hockey puck puzzles, and the atrocious platforming is somehow acceptable? Like we're all biting our tongues because we're afraid Capcom will become inconsolable?! Is this seriously going to be something we all keep mum and tell sweet little lies about? "Oh honey, you totally pull off that pixie cut! It looks SO GOOD on you!" Yes, yes, you're happy she's all "motivated" now but the pixie cut is still stupid. And DMC4's levels are still absolutely terrible.\n\nLet's not even get onto the whole "Vergil, bane of chairs" nonsense you have to do if you care about rank.\n\nSo, yes, good news, it's DMC4 with new characters and you get to pay for the cheat codes. Bad news, it's still DMC4 and not DMC3 or DMC1, both of which clean this game's clock. You will still not be challenged by a single non boss enemy for two whole playthroughs of this tedious slog of a game because it neither gets hard or interesting until the third difficulty. Progress is not saved between the now three character selections you can opt for so if you want to unlock the boss rush for everyone on every difficulty that is a whopping 15 times you're clearing this game. NOBODY beat DMC4 15 times. And nobody will. Because everyone else spent the rest of their time using the debug mode to skip to the GOOD parts of the game... which you aren't going to get here because Capcom has paid DLC to unlock all the difficulties so if you try to get debug shenanigans or a 100% save file to skip to the good part, you are not paying Capcom for the privilege and thus will not be allowed it.\n\nAll that aside, absolutely worth it on a very good sale because the core of DMC is still a good game but good heavens, why remake this and not fix any of the dumb crap about it?","June 24, 2015","false","16.8"," 16 of 49 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","16","49","2","2"

If you want to say my view is not useful, please read it and see how little you know about this game. I bought this game and I knew I will just buy it no matter how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is, because I liked this series for many years and I bought this for my favourite Vergil in DMC3. If it is the first time you play DMC(No DmC, that is ♥♥♥♥.).try HD collection on console, but not this one.\n\nFirst I want to claim that DMC series (except the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DmC) is a hardcore series. If you quit before completing the DMD, you are not my reader and please ignore me. (Also I want to tell you DMD is the hardest mode because most hardcore players want 3S and no damage for each DMD mission. hell and hell does not include enemies with devil trigger so it is much more easier.) All essense of DMC is in DMD. I repeat. ALL ESSENCE OF DMC IS IN DMD.\n\nPros:\n1.Vergil is back. As a super fan of DMC3 since PS2 age, seeing an original Vergil in DMC4 is MUCH better than seeing an idiot with same name in DmC.(Yes DmC is ♥♥♥♥ and I do not want to argur this with anyone disagrees with me.) This is the reason I bought it on steam. That is enough.\n\n2.Improved texture, lighting and overall quality. One might find the frame rate slow if you play with a laptop. That is because the game will not use the graphic card as the 3D processor but the integrated video processor in your CPU. You need to configure it manually from Nvidia Control Panel. After that, just turn everything to super high and enjoy the game if you laptop is a relatively new one.\n\n3.Nice new custumes. This is somehow useless because DMC4 is an open mod game. There are many good mods out there and if you do not have the one you want, why bother making one yourself. I even see a miku mod some days ago.\n\nCons\n1. auto saving. I know US games like auto save but this is silly for DMC4. For example, top players can start DMD from NOTHING and still get 3S and no damage. To do this one needs to open a new save data. NOW IT IS IMPOSSIBLE. If we want to do that we need to delete the save data and forcely open the DMD mode using softwares like cheat engine. It will change values of bits in memory. Yes it is cheating but usually we make game harder using this. We used to have mode called GMD(God must die) which gives enemies much more HP, and enemies with devil trigger from the very beginning of each battle. EVEN THOUGH, there are 3S and no damage walkthrough. Auto saving just make these actions more complicated. Remember, JAPANESE ACT DO NOT NEED AUTO SAVING.\n\n2.Inverse control scheme with DMC3. There are many DMC3 players who plays 4se and I want to say I really want to kill the game maker for reversing the order of weapon changing and summoned sword. This is just so silly. Wepan changing problem is easy to slove just by interchaning the two keys but the summon sword gives me much headache. Capcom you need to know I buy this ♥♥♥♥ just because I deeply loves DMC3, DMC1 and I liked this series for 10 years. Can't you just\nshow some respect to players like me? You may make more money but I bet you will not make any more CLASSICS. ♥♥♥♥ IT.\n\n3.FS+DT. FSDT is the technique of Dante and now it is used for Vergil as well. You ONLY NEED 2 PUNCHES TO KILL M20 BOSS. ♥♥♥♥ IT. Now I am playing a similar system. In DMC3 SE the systems of Vergil and Dante are very different. Behind  a fancy new character, I see depletion of creativity.\n\n4.No rising sun of Beowolf. Rising sun of Beowolf in DMC3 is of great help because it has 2 hits. This 2 hits can be used for combo. No we don't have it. Instead you have lunar phase in the mid air. This will wipe out many possibilities for good combo construction.\n\n5.Reduced HP of Boss. No you cannot just reduce the overall difficulties and use it to attract causal players NOOOOOO!!!! Dealing with BOSS's different attack pattern is a very important part in ACT and now you tell me you can kill a DMD boss with 2 punches? ♥♥♥♥ IT. Capcom just make more good games please and do not use the old ♥♥♥♥ with lower diffculties to attract players who will just throw the game away fater they see all CG. Please DON'T do this. Alright you did it. ♥♥♥♥ IT.\n\n6.Some vergil's skill is from DmC, FUCCCCCK IT!!!!\n\n\nOverall, I bought this game for the series, but I did not recommend it.\n","June 24, 2015","false","8.7"," 6 of 32 people (19%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","19","6","32","5","3"

Even though the graphics supposedly have not been changed, I experienced a moderately lower fps than in original DMC4.\n-In some frames there is visible pixelisation for some weird reason.\n-Was kind of dissapointed that saves from original DMC4 are not supported :(\n\nThat's my impression of the first hour of gameplay.Even though it's certainly not enough for a decent review, my point was to inform people that currently game tends to be a bit unstable. As for now I wouldn't recommend it, hopefully most of the issues will be resolved in upcoming weeks.","June 23, 2015","false","6.9"," 14 of 51 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","14","51","0","3"

If you're desperate to play as Trish or Vergil and you're that much of a fan of the DMC franchise, by all means, this is for you. The graphical improvements are almost neglible when in comparison to the previous DMC4. The video settings set to 'Max' doesn't really do anything special over the first DMC4 for PC. Still, it's buttery smooth and quite a fast pace hack and slash game. I'd wait till this was on sale. It's not worth $24.99 that's for sure.

Mind you, I've clocked nearly 100 hours in the vanilla version between an old laptop and an off-the-shelf desktop, and I've never had a problem getting it to run at 60 fps. I don't see how the additions in this version warrant such a performance drop.\n\nIf you have decent specs then it might work just fine, and I would highly recommend this title to anyone who missed out on the original DMC4 if only to experience the base content.  But understand that this version's performance is completely unacceptable.\n\nThat said, even the content they added is somewhat unpolished. You'll still be playing through the same levels from the vanilla version. You can even see in the official previews that the new characters were implemented with a complete lack of effort beyond their gameplay. Notice how each time an enemy mob is activated, there's a short cutscene where the camera pans around a bunch of static character models. Where in Dante/Nero scenarios the enemies might at least have some spawning animations, with the new characters it looks like the scene was hastily thrown together in the engine as if it was an alpha build.","June 23, 2015","false","1.0"," 14 of 57 people (25%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","25","14","57","3","0"

So I stopped play and waited for the PC version. Now the "PC" version is out (go check online, Capcom announced that the DMC 4 special edition will only be on PC), and I still cannot use my mouse to control. Now tell me, what is the point of releasing a PC version? Dont get me wrong, I loved DMC, it is a great game, but what is wrong with the control design? Is it too hard to program the mouse controls on PC??????????????? Well if Capcom can design a unique score system for DMC, then I dont think it is that hard to design the mouse controls for the game right???? Please dont tell me to plug in a control sitck, if a game is on PC port, then it should be able to operate by just keyboard and mouse, that's it.

The game recycles the same campaign three times (With five different characters), which already repeats itself twice. There's going to be a lot of repetition, so you have to love the gameplay in order to get any enjoyment out of this game.\n\nAnd thankfully, the gameplay is really polished despite some hickups regarding enemy and level design. The two characters you could play as originally, Nero and Dante, are still as fun and complex as they were in the original title. The three new charcters, Vergil, Lady, and Trish are great additions to the game. Well, at least Vergil is. Lady is alright, but the gun gimmick doesn't click with me. Really didn't care for Trish. Her gameplay was so shallow I couldn't stand to play as her for too long.\n\nA criticism I have with this game is the optimization. The original Devil May Cry 4 was notable for being one of the only good PC ports Capcom has made. The port was so good in fact, that it was considered the definitive version of the title due to it's low requirements and the edition of Turbo mode and Legendary Dark Knight difficulty. Unfortunately, SE isn't as well optimized as the original. There's a lot of unnecessary post processing effects that make the game chug and stutter. You can't turn these off through normal means, so you'd have to look up a guide on how to remove those with a hex editor. I'm hoping Capcom releases a patch that better optimizes the game and adds more graphics options.\n\nAs I've said before, you'd need to REALLY love these sort of games if you want to get any enjoyment out of this. If you're the type of person that's in to hack n' slashes and has a relatively decent PC and a gamepad, try this game out and see what you think.","November 1, 2015","true","85.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The original game is very good, the combat is amazing, the plot is average (it's ok), but you feel like a badass. The main gripe I have about this game is that Dante does not have enough levels, sure he does get to play through speedier version of Nero's levels but it isn't enough, and once you beat the game twice, the levels become extremely repetitive. Nero's game play is amazing. The devil bringer is a really unique part of the combat and allows you to do actions that are otherwise not possible. Dante's mode switching is pretty good, but I find myself sticking to sword master mostly. I also wish you had more time to use Dante's new weapons. Final boss can be annoying with the boss constantly teleporting and flying around. But other than that the game was amazing. The combos and the style ranking keeps your blood pumping, the unlock able skills and abilities make you feel stronger as you play through the game. Also Vergil is a god like mother f*****. His weapons are all good, and his play style is different but very satisfying one. You feel truly powerful teleporting around and slicing up enemies, also the concentration bar keeps you aware of how many times you get hit. Lady and Trish are also pretty cool and unique, but Vergil is the real badass here. The thing that is most sad is that this game wasn't even considered 40% done. Dante and Nero were supposed to have their own story lines and Nero was supposed to eventually get a full demon devil trigger instead of the ghost he has. Not to mention that Lucifer, Gilgamesh, and Pandora were also supposed to be their own bosses, but instead he just get these weapons without a real back story. In conclusion, the combat is one of the best out there even to this date, but the story and levels will eventually become annoying to replay over and over. I hope they make a devil may cry 5 and get everything right.\nP.S there shouldn't be any micro transactions, that is a big no-no.

This much is already known. But is the Special Edition worth getting? If you haven't played the original version of the game, then the answer is a resounding "Yes:" this is the version you should get. But what if you have played the original? Then, the answer is still yes. The three new characters are all fun to play, and they all feel unique. Vergil plays a little bit like Dante, with swappable weapons, but instead of Styles, he has a new Concentration mechanic. The greater your concentration, the more damage your attacks deal, and there are even a few super-powerful attacks that can only be performed when your concentration is at its maximum. Concentration is increased by hitting enemies and taunting, and its depleted when you take damage, miss with an attack, or run. This encourages a vastly different playstyle where you actually play similarly to how Vergil fought as a boss in DMC3, and once you get it down, it feels amazing. Lady is a ranged-oriented character, with many types of guns, and a massive explosion attack instead of a Devil Trigger. She has very little in the way of melee attacks, but she has so many different moves with her various guns that she remains somewhat versatile regardless. The only complaint with her is that since so many enemies are designed to be challenging in melee, she makes many portions of the game far too easy. Trish is probably the most similar to Nero and Dante in her playstyle, but even she feels distinct, with her own suite of moves. She's also fantastic at grinding red orbs, as she has a combo attack that can obtain a ludicrous number from the giant red crystals. Besides that, the game has added new alternate costumes for the characters (some of which you will need to unlock), and increased the drop rates of Red Orbs and Proud Souls, to cut down on the grind.

This does provide some problems however for example Vergil and Trish Severly outclass the original characters of Nero and Dante but lets be honest if your a major fan of the previous DMC4 you have played them so many times you probably will only focus on the new cast.

Omnis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shinbomnis/","370 products in account","A well-made PC port of an old favorite of mine. Devil May Cry 4 was ironically the game to introduce me to the franchise, and so it has a special place in my heart, despite being an inferior game to Devil May Cry 3. This Special Edition makes it run well on PCs and has clearly been designed to allow pc gamers to better enjoy this old games with very useful options such as support for high resolutions and improved textures and FPS. The only truly new content added to the gameplay are the inclusion of Vergil, Lady, and Trish as playable characters, who all have very different playstyles compared to Dante and Nero, and add a lot of fun and replay value to the game. Vergil is especially fun if you're like me and enjoy that power fantasy of being an unstoppable badass tearing through enemies with his incredible speed and power. The combat is just as enjoyable as it has always been. The story isn't the best, and its not trying to be, settling for playful camp humor that displays a self-awareness many "serious" games today could learn from. Overall Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition is a welcome upgrade to the original which adds a few new bells and whistles to keep things fresh for an already fun, enjoyable game.","November 25, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I havent played it since 2008 for the PS3 so finally I can try it again. My only problem is that Vergil isnt so involved with the story, he is just shoehorned in the missions and the boss battles. He has only one move from Dante which is the million stab. Other then that I am having fun and so far no problems running this game but it is running the same old graphic engine, from the older game from 2008 and running on Direct X 10 so no graphic enhancements so you can tell this game has aged. I can say its still fun to play so thats all it matters.

The original game is very good, the combat is amazing, the plot is average (it's ok), but you feel like a badass. The main gripe I have about this game is that Dante does not have enough levels, sure he does get to play through speedier version of Nero's levels but it isn't enough, and once you beat the game twice, the levels become extremely repetitive. Nero's game play is amazing. The devil bringer is a really unique part of the combat and allows you to do actions that are otherwise not possible. Dante's mode switching is pretty good, but I find myself sticking to sword master mostly. I also wish you had more time to use Dante's new weapons. Final boss can be annoying with the boss constantly teleporting and flying around. But other than that the game was amazing. The combos and the style ranking keeps your blood pumping, the unlock able skills and abilities make you feel stronger as you play through the game. Also Vergil is a god like mother f*****. His weapons are all good, and his play style is different but very satisfying one. You feel truly powerful teleporting around and slicing up enemies, also the concentration bar keeps you aware of how many times you get hit. Lady and Trish are also pretty cool and unique, but Vergil is the real badass here. The thing that is most sad is that this game wasn't even considered 40% done. Dante and Nero were supposed to have their own story lines and Nero was supposed to eventually get a full demon devil trigger instead of the ghost he has. Not to mention that Lucifer, Gilgamesh, and Pandora were also supposed to be their own bosses, but instead he just get these weapons without a real back story. In conclusion, the combat is one of the best out there even to this date, but the story and levels will eventually become annoying to replay over and over. I hope they make a devil may cry 5 and get everything right.\nP.S there shouldn't be any micro transactions, that is a big no-no. Capcom needs to stop that.\n","October 29, 2015","true","28.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tittybonghit/recommended/329050/","tittybonghit","Chill Dragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tittybonghit/","83 products in account","This game is a bit hard to recommend to a good number of people. The game recycles the same campaign three times (With five different characters), which already repeats itself twice. There's going to be a lot of repetition, so you have to love the gameplay in order to get any enjoyment out of this game.\n\nAnd thankfully, the gameplay is really polished despite some hickups regarding enemy and level design. The two characters you could play as originally, Nero and Dante, are still as fun and complex as they were in the original title. The three new charcters, Vergil, Lady, and Trish are great additions to the game. Well, at least Vergil is. Lady is alright, but the gun gimmick doesn't click with me. Really didn't care for Trish. Her gameplay was so shallow I couldn't stand to play as her for too long.\n\nA criticism I have with this game is the optimization. The original Devil May Cry 4 was notable for being one of the only good PC ports Capcom has made. The port was so good in fact, that it was considered the definitive version of the title due to it's low requirements and the edition of Turbo mode and Legendary Dark Knight difficulty. Unfortunately, SE isn't as well optimized as the original. There's a lot of unnecessary post processing effects that make the game chug and stutter. You can't turn these off through normal means, so you'd have to look up a guide on how to remove those with a hex editor. I'm hoping Capcom releases a patch that better optimizes the game and adds more graphics options.\n\nAs I've said before, you'd need to REALLY love these sort of games if you want to get any enjoyment out of this. If you're the type of person that's in to hack n' slashes and has a relatively decent PC and a gamepad, try this game out and see what you think.","November 1, 2015","true","85.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I play ALL DMC's and i never had a serious complainant for one of there games ( apart from the damn camera! ). Now DMC4 on PS3 was interesting to say the least with the introduction of a new playable character to the lore, although when i first played Nero.. ill be honest i didn't care much for his persona ( KYRIE X 9000 ) but i got used to him and his versatile game-style makes him a joy to play with. Now, i seen the PC Special Edition and well.. I loved Vergil... always did... always will.. SO when i could play through with the dark brother and Yamato it was bought with very little hesitation.\n\nQuick run down,\nIf your new to the genre of games- this one can be challenging for a while.\nGame-play- as all in the franchise, the first play through is the story the rest is repeat,repeat but this one is so good!\nGraphics- for the age of the game.. very good in my opinion.\nStory- good, but lacks real meaning and i feel they could have done more with the Vergil play through.\n\nOverall score- 8/10.. I personally fell the story really lacks on the end and in certain parts, but the game as a whole is worth it..

So many years after I played its original version, I'm still excited to see the release of special edition. Compare to many other action games, battle in DMC4 is always like a show rather than a fight. If you are an action game fan, this is a must have. If not, this is where you begin to love great action games.\nGraphics: 9/10 It may not be that good compared to some games like witcher3 and dragon age. But consider it being completed several years ago, it is awesome at that time and even in today it still looks great. Minus 1 point for not making much progress.\nStory: 8/10 Minus 2 point for not having much story with three new characters. DMC's story script is always good among action games. But you know, it's action game. Action games usually have simple stories. Looking for some touching long stories? I'm afraid this is not what you want.\nMusic: x/10 It's ok for me. But whether you like it or not, you have to figure it out yourself.\nGameplay: 9/10 Great game experience. Every characters have their own style. Capcom has done enough optimization work to keep it running on fps. Never feel delay in game. Remember to switch to your discrete GPU. It lag as hell when play Dark knight with integrated graphics. One more thing to keep in mind is this game includes some puzzle. They are not that difficult, but if you don't know where to go next, use google.\n\nIn general, it is a great game to have.  When you get used to it, you will find much pleasure in your show time. Such a Pity Capcom stop making good games like DMC4 these days.","July 25, 2015","true","43.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So Vergil is pretty much a dante with the trickster and a swordslinger with a little bit of that snatch from nero. Summoned swords is not like nero's that stuns frost. vergil can only stun small enemies mostly scarecrows. Vergil's D.T is a bit O.P but hey its Vergil, he needs more power thats why. So thats sums up Vergils gameplay fast and APM depedent with a little bit of timeing included. For you combo folks out there you might want to stick with dante if you really want extreme style without the use of APM, BUT!!! if you have fast APM like me then make sure to play Vergil!!!! because its just stylish as crap!!! you can reach SSS extremly fast when his concentration bar is full and using his timed judgment cuts. (storyline) The only bad thing about this game is that the campain is short and it doesn't show how Vergil suddenly showed up out of no where. Thats the only bad thing about this game, the story, everything is awesome and if you don't mind the short story of this game your going to mostly spend you time in the bloody palace if your like me. :D\n=====================\nVerdict time!!:\nThis game is a stylish game that gives new comers a awesome character which is Vergil and a awesome competetor against dante for the veterans out there like I do. Because of the short story but awesome game mechanics im going to give this game a 10/10 with a SSS badge of awesomeness!!!!!!\n====================\nHope you enjoyed that review this is a must for new dmc comers and veterans a like!!!\nPlease check out my youtube channel its not the best but I have a 2 min long video for Vergil doing some sick combo!!!\nLink: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzljU6Srs7xfXYuxnBsX9fw\nalso add on steam if you want to play other games!!!","July 18, 2015","true","42.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From the very first game in the early 2000s to the most recent western reboot, I just can never get enough of the immensely satisfying and stylish hack-n-slash action. With DMC1 having the best story progression, DMC2 a complete tragedy, DMC3 SE being my all-time favorite and the original DMC4 being slightly disappointing; and the western reboot though excellent in its own way, doesn't quite feel the same--- So the release of this game is an absolute delight.\n\nAfter spending dozens of hours playing through the game, I am confident to say that this is the definitive Devil May Cry experience to any newcomers or veterans alike.  This is not just another HD remaster game like many tend to be in the market; this is a different beast on its own. First is the graphic upscaling and the new 60fps cap which render much detailed and sharper images and textures, smoother animations which only enhances the gameplay’s fluidity so much more than ever before. Turbo mode is a welcoming return from DMC3 SE. The biggest edition of this version of the game is the three new playable characters, Vergil, Trish, and Lady, which offers 3 new distinctive play style in an already excellent action-packed experience. Vergil can play through all 20 missions, while Lady and Trish plays Nero and Dante’s missions respectively. One really noticeable thing is that the new characters is clearly designed around the new Legendary Sparda mode in which majority of their move sets consist of huge AoE and crowd control effect which made them seem really overpowered, especially Vergil. Though I wouldn’t say they are completely unbalanced but to get the most out of their skills, playing on a harder difficulty is highly recommended.\n\nAbout the brand new “Legendary Sparda Mode”, it’s a silly idea on paper, and even more ridiculous in actual gameplay. Having an overwhelming number of enemies swarming at the same area, it’s hard to keep up or even see what is going on at times; enemies would just keep spawning and flying all over places as you press buttons. Not to say the game becomes a button masher in that mode, just the fact that the combat becomes mindless and instinctive rather than being grounded and tactical. I guess it can be both a good and bad thing depends on you play style, it is not a mode to be taken seriously, but one thing for sure that it is still tons of fun to play with. It also showcase in a technical aspect, despite all the explosive actions and the sheer number of things happening on screen, the gameplay still runs smoothly at a stable 60fps throughout, with no screen-tearing or slowdowns, which is definitely impressive.\n\nLoads of contents plus hours of fun at only half of normal retail price. Not to mention that this is an excellent PC port and really well optimized. Easy to pick up and learn, hard to master; this is the spirit of any DMC titles (except 2, that game sucks so much). Greatness through and through, anyone looking for an over-the-top action game, this is a must-buy. Any fans of the franchise will without a doubt, adore this gem.\n","July 19, 2015","true","29.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You poor, poor soul, you.\nDMC4 is a spectacle fighter. Basically, a spectacle fighter is just a really, REALLY flashy beat-em-up. What this boils down to is a game where you spend all of your time juggling enemies in insane fashions, with combos that are as badass as they are impractical, and weapons to match. You get bonus points for varying your combos up, and being as stylish and awesome as possible. The flashier your moves, and the cooler you look, the more the game rewards you.\n\nOut of all of the games, this one is probably the easiest to just pick up and play with no frame of reference or context for who the characters are. I'd say that's the best way to play this game, to be honest, because then you get to feel what Nero feels as he's meeting all of these iconic characters for the first time. You won't have any idea who Dante is, or Gloria, but neither does the guy you're playing as. This doesn't apply to the "bonus" campaigns though, those being Vergil, Lady, and Trish. The game doesn't really properly introduce those characters to you, so you'll be totally lost. But there really isn't much to the story in DMC, and these bonus campaigns don't really have their own storyline, so you don't really need to know them to have a good time.\n\nThe game is definitely the easiest in the franchise, but it's still Devil May Cry. You're gonna die a lot at first, and you're gonna get lost, but you'll take to it eventually. Once you get used to them, the controls are REALLY ♥♥♥♥ing good--everything you want them to be in a specular fighter.\n\nThe only thing I can really compain about is that this is one of those "Where the hell do I go" kind of games. Expect your first playthrough to be a lot of running around aimlessly, very frustrated, trying to figure out where the ♥♥♥♥ you're supposed to be. This is made even worse by the fact that, because it has roots in the Resident Evil series, you will see a lot of things in the levels that you can't interact with yet. These things will come in handy two or five levels down the road, but they only serve to make your first playthrough even more annoying.\n\nOverall, it's a very niche game, but it's also a very fun game. Considering you can get refunds very easily and quickly now, I recommend at least buying it and trying it if you have any interest at all, even if it isn't on sale. Trust me, you'll probably thank me for it.\n\n\n\n\nFor the Fans♥♥♥♥ yeah! You don't need this--buy this ♥♥♥♥!\n\nRemember the first time you saw the prerendered cutscenes in DMC4, and wished so desparately that the rest of the game looked that nice?\nRemember the disappointment when you completed the whole game, only to find out that the rumours were all lies, and you couldn't play as Vergil when you beat it?\nRemember the sheer sorrow when you found out that Lady and Trish practically aren't in the game at all?\nYeah. I know I do. This rerelease fixes ALL of those problems. The characters in-game now look nearly identical to their pre-rendered counterparts(On max graphics), and you now get to play as Trish, Lady, and Vergil right from the get-go. Well--sorta. Lady and Trish are bound to the same campaign, like Nero and Dante, and you just replay the Nero-Dante story as them. Likewise, when you play Vergil, you just go back through Nero's story as him.\n\n\nGo. Buy. Play. Now.","December 22, 2015","true","18.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fortheussr/recommended/329050/","fortheussr","chairbender","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fortheussr/","342 products in account","An great example of the hack and slash genre. I got introduced to this sort of game playing Bayonetta, then Bayonetta 2 and Wonderful 101. Despite some differences in the combat mechanics between this and Platinum hack and slash games, the core element that makes all these games fun is still there: a complex combat system and an invitation (and motivation) to master it. Playing through this game once on normal mode is hardly the full experience of this game. You will experience some sense of mastery of the mechanics, but you can get even more out of this by going for higher rankings, secret missions, playing as different characters, and all sorts of other stuff.\n\nThat said, after playing this, I'd still say I prefer Bayonetta 2. First, I had issues with the camera during combat, which is especially problematic due to the presence of enemies that can charge at you or hit you from a distance. It's something that you can overcome with experience, though. Second, I was really used to the heavily dodge and counter based gameplay of Platinum games, and I felt that there wasn't so much of an emphasis on that in this game (at least with how I was playing). It doesn't really seem to reward you with anything (like Bayonetta's slow motion) when you dodge stuff, and I found the controls for dodging to be a little unpleasant. You have to press to the left or right of an enemy and press a button, and if you don't get the direction right you'll end up jumping up or back. Compare that to Bayonetta, where you can just press one button and any direction and you'll dodge. It adds an element of execution to the dodging that I didn't really appreciate. I didn't find any sort of counter mechanic in my playthrough (maybe it had something to do with Royal Guard). So, basically, I'm just saying this game is different than Bayonetta 2 in some ways I didn't like.\n\nOverall, if you like hack and slash games, you'll find there's a lot to get out of this. If you don't know whether you like those sorts of games, this might not be the best introduction.","December 31, 2015","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lady/Trish highlights the most frustrating parts about the game, but Vergil gives you what the game should have been.\n\n\nIf you are looking for a recommendation, I say go for it. The gameplay is awesome, and the addition of 3 new characters is absolutely incredible.  If you are new to the series this is probably the best game you can get on steam if you want to see what all the hubbub is about (DMC3 is a better game, but the port is.... well terrible)\n\nIf you are wondering why this game got terrible reviews back in the day though, allow me to explain. First of all, and this is something that this new game cannot fix, is the game has the worse pacing pretty much ever because of character switching and environment reuse. Roughly 50% of the way through if you are playing as either Nero/Dante or Lady/Trish you will change to the other character, and then on the last 2 levels, during the famous Capcom boss rush and final boss you will switch back.\n\nThe Nero/Dante switch was considered annoying back in the day, but the 2 characters play somewhat similarly, so it was annoying but not the end of the world. However, the Lady/Trish switch, although I love both characters, is the most jarring and confusing mess ever, because the 2 characters aren't even remotely close. By the time I got used to how awesome Trish was, I was playing Lady again, and had to relearn everything to fight bosses. Super Annoying.\n\nBut if you play through the game as Vergil, that doesn't happen. Since he plays by himself, the pacing seems way better, despite of all the backtracking and dice games (shudder). This is how the game should have been designed, imho.\n\nI like the new characters, and if Capcom needed people to buy this in order to make more, I'll gladly throw money down. All I ask is next time, allow us to use whatever character we want for the duration of the story and switch, or have each character have their own complete levels that are independent of the others. Action games like DmC are about unlocking new abilities and getting better over time, when you interrupt that process via forced character switching you damage the natural pace of the genre. Don't do it again! :P","January 4","true","35.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Devil May Cry 4 was ironically the game to introduce me to the franchise, and so it has a special place in my heart, despite being an inferior game to Devil May Cry 3. This Special Edition makes it run well on PCs and has clearly been designed to allow pc gamers to better enjoy this old games with very useful options such as support for high resolutions and improved textures and FPS. The only truly new content added to the gameplay are the inclusion of Vergil, Lady, and Trish as playable characters, who all have very different playstyles compared to Dante and Nero, and add a lot of fun and replay value to the game. Vergil is especially fun if you're like me and enjoy that power fantasy of being an unstoppable badass tearing through enemies with his incredible speed and power. The combat is just as enjoyable as it has always been. The story isn't the best, and its not trying to be, settling for playful camp humor that displays a self-awareness many "serious" games today could learn from. Overall Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition is a welcome upgrade to the original which adds a few new bells and whistles to keep things fresh for an already fun, enjoyable game.","November 25, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The original game is very good, the combat is amazing, the plot is average (it's ok), but you feel like a badass. The main gripe I have about this game is that Dante does not have enough levels, sure he does get to play through speedier version of Nero's levels but it isn't enough, and once you beat the game twice, the levels become extremely repetitive. Nero's game play is amazing. The devil bringer is a really unique part of the combat and allows you to do actions that are otherwise not possible. Dante's mode switching is pretty good, but I find myself sticking to sword master mostly. I also wish you had more time to use Dante's new weapons. Final boss can be annoying with the boss constantly teleporting and flying around. But other than that the game was amazing. The combos and the style ranking keeps your blood pumping, the unlock able skills and abilities make you feel stronger as you play through the game. Also Vergil is a god like mother f*****. His weapons are all good, and his play style is different but very satisfying one. You feel truly powerful teleporting around and slicing up enemies, also the concentration bar keeps you aware of how many times you get hit. Lady and Trish are also pretty cool and unique, but Vergil is the real badass here. The thing that is most sad is that this game wasn't even considered 40% done. Dante and Nero were supposed to have their own story lines and Nero was supposed to eventually get a full demon devil trigger instead of the ghost he has. Not to mention that Lucifer, Gilgamesh, and Pandora were also supposed to be their own bosses, but instead he just get these weapons without a real back story. In conclusion, the combat is one of the best out there even to this date, but the story and levels will eventually become annoying to replay over and over. I hope they make a devil may cry 5 and get everything right.\nP.S there shouldn't be any micro transactions, that is a big no-no. Capcom needs to stop that.\n","October 29, 2015","true","28.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, this is NOT going to run on a toaster you poor pc peasant.\nLevel design could have been done way better and not just repeating the levels but with Nero and backwards.\n---------\nThe game features really fun gameplay and the best OST in the series, playing with Nero's demon hand is really fun, while Dante's gameplay is the best in the whole 5 damn games. Unrelated: It's really funny when you make Dante dance while changing styles.\nLady and Trish's devil trigger is OP\nDante's levels play really well since they're harder than Nero's, but that issue is solved playing harder difficulties with Nero  you scrub .\n\nThis game feels way more complete than the original.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tittybonghit/recommended/329050/","tittybonghit","Chill Dragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tittybonghit/","83 products in account","This game is a bit hard to recommend to a good number of people. The game recycles the same campaign three times (With five different characters), which already repeats itself twice. There's going to be a lot of repetition, so you have to love the gameplay in order to get any enjoyment out of this game.\n\nAnd thankfully, the gameplay is really polished despite some hickups regarding enemy and level design. The two characters you could play as originally, Nero and Dante, are still as fun and complex as they were in the original title. The three new charcters, Vergil, Lady, and Trish are great additions to the game. Well, at least Vergil is. Lady is alright, but the gun gimmick doesn't click with me. Really didn't care for Trish. Her gameplay was so shallow I couldn't stand to play as her for too long.\n\nA criticism I have with this game is the optimization. The original Devil May Cry 4 was notable for being one of the only good PC ports Capcom has made. The port was so good in fact, that it was considered the definitive version of the title due to it's low requirements and the edition of Turbo mode and Legendary Dark Knight difficulty. Unfortunately, SE isn't as well optimized as the original. There's a lot of unnecessary post processing effects that make the game chug and stutter. You can't turn these off through normal means, so you'd have to look up a guide on how to remove those with a hex editor. I'm hoping Capcom releases a patch that better optimizes the game and adds more graphics options.\n\nAs I've said before, you'd need to REALLY love these sort of games if you want to get any enjoyment out of this. If you're the type of person that's in to hack n' slashes and has a relatively decent PC and a gamepad, try this game out and see what you think.","November 1, 2015","true","85.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

DMC4 SE changes things enough for me to enjoy it. Currently at 10 hours and still have a lot to do in the game. The main campaign is still not as good as 3 - but that doesnt mean its a bad game. Legandary Dark Knight and Vergil specifically is what  make this game fantastic. Theres plenty of costumes too (which is nice). I've critqued this more on tumblr but if you like the DMC franchise this is a no brainer must have. My only real gripe is that outside of Legandry Dark Knight mode the game is a little easy.","July 24, 2015","true","108.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lady/Trish highlights the most frustrating parts about the game, but Vergil gives you what the game should have been.\n\n\nIf you are looking for a recommendation, I say go for it. The gameplay is awesome, and the addition of 3 new characters is absolutely incredible.  If you are new to the series this is probably the best game you can get on steam if you want to see what all the hubbub is about (DMC3 is a better game, but the port is.... well terrible)\n\nIf you are wondering why this game got terrible reviews back in the day though, allow me to explain. First of all, and this is something that this new game cannot fix, is the game has the worse pacing pretty much ever because of character switching and environment reuse. Roughly 50% of the way through if you are playing as either Nero/Dante or Lady/Trish you will change to the other character, and then on the last 2 levels, during the famous Capcom boss rush and final boss you will switch back.\n\nThe Nero/Dante switch was considered annoying back in the day, but the 2 characters play somewhat similarly, so it was annoying but not the end of the world. However, the Lady/Trish switch, although I love both characters, is the most jarring and confusing mess ever, because the 2 characters aren't even remotely close. By the time I got used to how awesome Trish was, I was playing Lady again, and had to relearn everything to fight bosses. Super Annoying.\n\nBut if you play through the game as Vergil, that doesn't happen. Since he plays by himself, the pacing seems way better, despite of all the backtracking and dice games (shudder). This is how the game should have been designed, imho.\n\nI like the new characters, and if Capcom needed people to buy this in order to make more, I'll gladly throw money down. All I ask is next time, allow us to use whatever character we want for the duration of the story and switch, or have each character have their own complete levels that are independent of the others. Action games like DmC are about unlocking new abilities and getting better over time, when you interrupt that process via forced character switching you damage the natural pace of the genre. Don't do it again! :P","January 4","true","35.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Take control of one of five playable characters in the Special Edition of Devil May Cry 4, the ultimate version of the smash-hit stylish action game!\n\nDevil May Cry 4 immerses gamers in a gothic supernatural world, where a new protagonist clashes with a familiar hero. As the new leading man, Nero, players will unleash incredible attacks and non-stop combos using a unique new gameplay mechanic, his powerful "Devil Bringer" arm.\n\nOn the coast of a distant land lies the castle town of Fortuna. It is here that the group known as the Order of the Sword practices a mysterious religion. They revere the demon warrior Sparda, who as their god fought to protect humans, and are committed to the extermination of all demons. Nero, a young knight from the Order, is tasked with finding Dante, the mysterious assassin who murdered the head of the Order of the Sword. At the same time, more demons begin to appear throughout the city. Nero will soon come to discover the motives behind Dante's appearance and the truth behind the intentions of the Order of the Sword.  - Highly Recommended!","July 29, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Game still has bad camera angles, but if you've been a DMC fan since it started, its not even a issue since we're used to it.\n\nNero & Dante: Nothing has been reworked (as far as I can tell) and it should stay that way. I felt like the fighting for both these characters was fine and you get to experience this all over again just like the original.\n\nVergil: I was wondering how they were going to go about Vergil, since they might have made his whole route just with Yamato, but they didn't. You get to use Yamato, Force Edge, and Beowulf (Weapons if you didn't notice). They also added an interesting mechanic called the Concentration Gauge. This mechanic allows you to do more damage while you land hits and idle while locking on yet and the same time do less damage while no lock-on dodging and missing hits. Btw Vergil is easily OP once you get the hang of it and I LOVE IT.\n\nLady & Trish: Lady's gameplay style relies more on keeping a distance and planning what guns to use. Max LvL Rocket launcher takes a LONG time to charge up, but dang SO MUCH DAMAGE. Dual pistols and Shotgun are fun to use. Btw Lady's Air hike (double jump) is a Rocket Jump..... Too stronk. Trish's gameplay style relies on a ridiculous amount of hits, but that doesn't matter when you don't do much damage. Trish really needs a slight damage buff and also fix the way you get more style with her because I did some crazy Pro SSS rank shiznit yet only get an A rank. I will give her brownie points for electric breakdancing though.\n\nOverall this game is very fun and I recommend it. And if you got the Original as well........... sorry you had to pay $25 for some DLC...","January 20","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The special attacks are simple to pull off if the camera is in back of you, if it's on the side, slanted, above, or even in front they are hard. Many attacks you have to go foward while holding down RB, the game doesn't register you doing the special attack unless the camera is behind you. Even if you try the reverse, like thinking the camera will view back as foward it doesn't work.\n\nIn some aspects Lady and Trish feel wrong. Lady is all about her guns. to defeat most bosses you jump around and shoot your rocket launcher at them which does a lot of damage. Plus Lady's Devil trigger is useless. Trish you never get to select weapons for, and every move you do seems like a combo but to get your combo rating up you have to pull two combo's off at once.\n\nI was never a fan of Nero, He was too much about grabbing and smashing with his arm, which oddly enough Lady plays somewhat like him with her hook.\n\nIt's a worthwhile game if your into devil may cry, and are feeling the urge to play with a new set of rules.

Well, then this game just may be for you. Devil May Cry is a series that has been tailored for just that, destroying demons and feeling amazing about how slick you did it. This title is an expansion pack to the original Devil May Cry 4 adding in new features such as new playable characters, costumes, a new play mode and even minor tweaks to the gameplay mechanics.\n\nDevil May Cry 4 is what I like to call a Technical Action game. What this means is that the game possesses many mechanics that have the potential to be mastered and require a lot of knowledge about the game to use said mechanics well. However, with that in mind, there is no reason a person who is just a casual player looking to just slice enemies up couldn't enjoy this game as well.\n\nIn terms of difficulty, this game is not lacking. There is a hefty amount of difficulty that this title brings to the table spread out across all of its modes. If you're a person who desires challenge, you'll find it here.\n\nThere is a lot to be appreciated visually in Devil May Cry 4. Taking a close look at the construction of the environments will leave you with the feeling of believing these characters belong here. The overall design really goes well across the board and does it job well of pulling the player in.\n\nI could not have been much happier with this game due to my passion for Technical Action titles. The game felt really nice in term of controls and left me feeling really good about nearly every fight. I felt like there was always something new to learn and improve on, but also could really feel the progress I was making in my own performance as a player.\n\nOverall, I would recomment this game to almost anyone. Within DMC4 there is a lot to do, a lot to see and a ton to learn. Unless you're really opposed to difficulty, you should grab this title. This game is not much for story but it is mainly focused on giving the player a self created cinematic experience through the dynamic combat.\n\n","May 5","true","24.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I know it says i only have under 30 hours, most of which was spent in BLoody Palace and practice with all the characters, i spent at least 3 to 4 times this on the Devil May Cry 4 for Xbox 360. For the entire series, ive dropped around 250 to 300 hours total (Yes including DmC sue me) and it shines as one of th best examples of Stylish action hack and slash. Of course, there is also the Xbox One and PS4 version, but what honestly makes the PC version stand out to me is just how much cool tech is being found daily and the amazing things speedrunners are finding. Some people who played DMC 4 spent years perfecting combo's that they furthered with the three new characters.\n\n(WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS READ AT OWN RISK)\n\nSpeaking of, the three new characters are:\n\nVergil- Older Brother of Dante. A very technical character who can be hard to master, he has thankfully been WAY upgraded combo wise than in Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition, and like in DMC 3, you start the game with Beowolf and Force Edge, but now they, like Yamato and Vergils skills, are buffed and more versatile.\n\nLady- Demon Hunter from DMC 3. Lady is centered around high damage and stringing gun combos between her two pistols, Shotgun, and Rocket Launcher. Not much to really say, as this was her first time being a playable character in a DMC game.\n\nTrish- Her moves copy Dante and Vergil, with some new flair and style in there. Her only other appearance being in Devil May Cry 2. I have personally never beaten Devil May Cry 2. She uses SParda, Twin pistols similar to Ebony & Ivory, and has lightning attacks. Her fighting style is similar to Rebellion Combo A and B, and similar to Beowolf and Gilgamesh combo's.\n\nThe game runs at a smooth 60 fps but can run at higher frame rates. The graphics are stellar, the sound still amazing, and the gameplay improved. Sadly, they couldnt change around much, becuase the original was a rushed game. This one still has the parts where it was rushed, but it shouldnt bother you. The core aspect is to kick ♥♥♥, get that SSS, and to hit that Jackpot!\n\nTL;DR:\nThis is a great game, even with a $24.99 price tag, if you've NEVER played DMC 4, don't buy it and just purchase the Special Edition, the extra $5 is worth it when the base game is $19.99.","May 4","true","37.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics still hold up for the age on this game, and the voice acting is pretty good, despite some of the lines being cheesy but that's par for the course in the Devil May Cry series, and I'm totally cool with that, same with the soundtrack, same kind of rock music that has been standard in the series that kicks into gear as soon as combat starts, nothing bad, just nothing that really stood out to me either. The combat is tight, responsive, and once you purchase more skills, it starts to really take off and the combos you can unleash lends themselves to even more epic moments during combat.\n\nSome of my complaints is that is that it takes a while to finally be able to play as Dante, and around that point in the game, he's pretty much exclusively used to backtrack through enemies, bosses and areas you've already beaten and gone through, which is a shame. It also kind of causes the game to become somewhat repetive if you chug through it in one go. I was expecting a whole other side to the game exclusive to Dante, but it is what it is, I still enjoyed it.\n\nThe other options in this version include being able to play through the campaign as Lady/Trish, as well as Dante's brother Vergil.\n\nPicked it up for cheap in a Humble Bundle, and I couldn't have been more happy with it. I've always been a fan of the series, and this game doesn't disappoint in the way that DMC2 did. If you're a fan of action games (Still hoping for a PC port/remastering of the Ninja Gaiden series), or a longtime fan of the series, check it out.
