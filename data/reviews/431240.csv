There is a colorful variety of custom options for the games, ranging from playing golf with cubes/eggs, to changing the gravity and changing how bouncy the balls are!\nI strongly recommend everyone to get this game if they have some friends that they can play it with, as I can see how it would get boring by yourself....just like real-life mini golf :>\n\nCheers,\n-trippy","March 30","true","13.9"," 71 of 76 people (93%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","93","71","76","9","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dirtydirtydirty/recommended/431240/","dirtydirtydirty","dirty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dirtydirtydirty/","108 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is a really nice mini golf game. It's currently early access on steam so theres quite a lot lacking but what you get now is worth the money I think.\n\nAnd what you get is two 18 hole courses: Forest and Oasis, played solo or with up to 11 other players. The courses themselves are varied, challenging and at times infuriating. Some holes require a bit of skill to navigate and others just rely on pure luck. At the moment Forest is the most complete level and you'll probably find yourself playing this most. There are currently a few bugs with Oasis that might sour the expirience a bit for you but the developers have a great road map planned out and i'm sure these bugs will be ironed out in future updates.\n\nThe graphics are similar to something you'd find on a Nintendo game: happy and colourful, which is perfect for a casual game like this. Music is fun and chirpy as well, but there are only 2 tracks that repeat so far. It would be nice to hear some new music in the future, as I eventually found myself muting out the repetitive music and playing my own.\n\nOptimization isn't great on mobile hardware currently (about 30 fps on low with a GTX965m) but runs great on my main PC and my friends one also. This game is very early into its roadmap so that's to be expected, and not really a huge problem right now. I think i'll probably get another 15-20 hours of fun from this game until they release more content.\n\n8/10","April 23","true","6.8"," 55 of 58 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","55","58","3","0"

Please note that the name change does not affect how the game plays. fs.\n\nFirst of all, with only 2 courses, this game ranks in my top 5 for price paid per hour of gameplay at 0.41c per hour, compared to rocket league (058.c) Euro Truck Sim 2 (0.63c) Civ 5 (1.24$) etc. for the amount of gameplay you get, its so worth the money.\n\nThis is the best mini golf game on steam already, only 3 months in to EA.\nThe two man dev team are passionately active on the forums, always taking into consideration what the community would like to see, they patch and fix bugs within hours (Most of the time) and are working really hard to make GWF a game that the community wants.\nAs for the gameplay, its terribly easy to point your aim and take a shot, but the difficulty comes from choosing the right power and path to the hole. If you play in a big enough lobby there is bound to be someone who is great at the game, who will be more than willing to teach you a trick or two!\nWith workshop support and new maps/reward system and skins coming soon you'll want to get on board straight away!\n\nAll in all a great little time consuming, semi-competitive mini golf game with boundless creativity that shows great promise if (like the community believes) the developers stay as passionate as they are already.\n\n9/10","May 5","true","17.4"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","33","35","4","0"

It is definitely worth it for the low price tag even though there is not much content at the moment (more is on the way).\n\nMaps\n\nThe two maps that currently come with the game are very replayable and I have not noticed many bugs in them at all so far. One of them is called Forest and the other Oasis. At the moment Forest contains less bugs than Oasis which contains a few minor ones.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nThe mulitplayer lacks players but it is very easy to create your own server and you can play with up to 12 people. Joining servers is not as easy though as you have to go through a list of about 12 pages. A search tool would make this much easier.\n\nCustomisation\n\nCustomisation is also available in the game with the ability to change the colour of the ball. As well as this, you can customise your server settings to change the way you play the game. For example, you can change the shape of the balls to eggs and add an ability to jump whilst playing.\n\nGraphics 7/10\nReplayability 9/10\nBugs 7/10\nMultiplayer 8/10\nOverall 7.75/10\n\nIn my opinion this game is definitely worth a try and I think it is the best mini golf game out there.","April 27","true","7.8"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","31","33","2","2"

I like the fact that you dont have to wait for everyone to shoot - you all get to shoot at the same time - like an orgy I would assume.

You can play single player for now but they soon plan to add in AI Enemies. I feel this game has a super amount of potential and will be very fun.\n\nPositives:\n+ Music - Awesome soundtrack which makes me happy\n+ Variety - The golf courses are real fun to play, they plan to add 6 in total but only have two on there for now.\n+ Very cheap price – For the price of the game I feel it’s most definitely worth it. Even with just these two courses.\n\nNegatives:\n- Not a lot of content yet (but that’s obvious as it’s in Early Access and runs risk of never being completed)\n- There is no real set difficulties to the courses. Would be nice for an Easy Course, Medium Course and Very Hard course instead of progressive which I get stuck on towards the end. I’m a novice! ;)\n- The game gets a bit rugged in the desert area and doesn’t run as smooth as the grasslands.\n\nI had a refreshing time playing Golf with Friends, my only regret is that I have no friends. (joke) I didn’t manage to test out the online section which would probably increase the games fun tenfold. I highly enjoyed single  player and practising on the courses which progressed from Easy to real difficult.\n\nI definitely recommend a purchase though and highly believe in the developers with following through, they are super friendly people and we talk often! We will see in time though! :) I believe in them!\n\nScore: Buy Now\n","January 30","true","1.3"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","0"

Here's why;\n\nMusic: The music is mind-blowing for lack of better words. It is capable of giving you a wide arrange of fealings from happiness to legitimate depression and agony. I would absolutely recommend turning it up to max as you enjoy/scream through your game of Mini-Golf with your friends. The composer has truely accomplished a feat with the one repeating song that plays throughout the entire game.\n\nPhysics: The physics in this game are surprisingly realistic and fair. That is, unless you change them so you're on the moon. Which brings me to my next point.\n\nOptions/Customization: Do you not like your white ball? Change it to hot pink! Not like that you can't collide with your friends? Make it so you can! Not like the gravity? Drag a bar and take a trip to Mars! Not like being in 3rd Person? Use the scroll wheel to go into 1st Person mode! I was actually surprised with the amount of things you could change in this game, which is actually cheaper than the average sandwhich. Use that logic to convince your friends to buy this game so you don't have to play it by yourself. Trust me, It worked for me.\n\nOverall Graphics: For an early access game this is top tier. Honestly. The screenshots aren't cutscenes, there actually aren't any cutscenes in this game, I mean it's mini-golf why would there be? All the screenshots are in game footage. Crazy huh?\n\nIt's Balanced: All the courses in this game are very well balanced, which suprised me since this is a golfing game. (aside for the ones you can access by turning on beta content, those need some work. Like ffs the Twilight map is hard af)\n\nBlacklight Interactive has done something spectacular with this game and I cannot wait for the Bogey Boy DLC.

Absolutely!\n\nWant to end friendships?\nTurn on collision and crank up the stroke limit!\n\nThis game is without a doubt worth every penny you pay for it. Even though it's in early access, it runs very smoothly and it's very popular with a large group of my friends.

Currently has 2 courses available with more planned on the way, a few quirky modes currently on the experimental version and possibly some of the best devs I've experienced despite only being a 2 man team.\n\nThey are very active on updates and have a roadmap in the forums if you want to see where they plan on taking it. They are very friendly and active on the forums and is taking community ideas and advice to make the game even better while also adding more to it in a fast enough manner.\n\nI highly recommend this to someone who wants a game that is more casual but has the options to make it a stressful race to the hole against others. There are plenty of Youtubers that have videos on it though they might be dated because of the constant tweaks by the devs but you can get an idea of what you'd be getting into from the videos, still though I think it's worth the price in it's current version with only 2 courses so when everything else eventually comes out it'll be more than cost efficient! :)","March 20","true","7.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","0"

After some updates have been made to the game, I can now recommend it. The price-tag isn't all too steep at $6 and for essentially a two-man development team, they have quite progressed since my initial review.\n\nThink of it as not "Golf" per-say, but Mini-Golf. It has two main areas which are the Forest and Oasis. Both have many holes to play through and they aren't as buggy as when I first started playing.\n\nYou can do custom settings like higher gravity, different types of balls(easter egg, sphere, isosphere, etc.), and some other misc. settings like collision.\n\nSome future maps are coming up, some party games, and some more additional stuff so it's worth investing and supporting the developers in the early stages.

The more players the better. Try it with many people on the shortest time and low strokes, great laugh!\n\nI do hope development goes by quickly and new maps are added.

This my friends is the ultimate expression of what the game of golf was always meant to be, in video game form. You will be taken to heaven in the luscious scenery of the "Forest" before falling to hell in the contradictory-named "Oasis". This game has been tailored for all the masochistic professional golfers of the world to devote their last bits of sanity to the glory of perfection. Also well suited for the beginner golfer setting out on his long journey from pallet town to collect all 8 gym badges and finally catch them all.

All you have to do is hold the left click and pull back the mouse.\n\nRuns great on most computers\n\nThere's a ton more pros but you guys get the idea.\n\n\nCons:\n\nNot a lot of players. Game came out Janurary 30th and didn't get featured on the front page of Steam, so it might be awhile before the playerbase gets heavier.\n\nOnly two courses, 18 holes each. They are currently working on some other courses and the potential of a content creator added.\n\nSome glitches. Just about all non game breaking.\n\n---\n\nAs you can see there are tons of reasons to by this game, the big one being it's not like other horrible early access games that are just buggy messes. It's $6, definitely worth it.\n\nMake sure to check out the subreddit!\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GolfWithFriendsGame","February 4","true","48.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The gameplay is very simple, and currently there are two courses with 18 holes each. That doesn't sound like a ton, but for 6 bucks, I feel that it's a great deal. Get a group of friends to buy this game, and let minigolf madness ensue.

There are only three maps and some bugs/glitches to be found. That's not terrible considering it's in very early access. The (3) maps are fantastic and all have a lot of replay value. Even though there are only (3) maps thus far I feel like the multiplayer is very fun. There are some cons, like not being able to voice chat in game or the lack of people playing atm (around 300-400 mid-day). Overall the game is very fun and if more people buy and try it out the better it will become.

I have never had so much fun playing a video game in YEARS now, Golf with Friends is easily the funnest thing I have ever done.\n\nThe game itself is extremely well polished for early access, if they didn't say on the store page, they could have easily sold this as a full release and nobody would question it, even with only two courses (18 holes each) it's so well done.\n\nThe music is very happy sounding, and quite addicting, it repeats on a loop basically forever... But you don't even notice it, even on a loop it's just that fitting to the game.  I could listen to this on a daily basis and still love it.\n\nThe physics of the game are almost flawless, with a little skill you can predict exactly where the ball will go, and sink that hole in one every time.\n\nThe courses, for there only being two... Are beautifully designed, with the classics such as windmills... All the way to being eaten by a sphinx, going throughout it's body, and being launched out into a temple of doom.\nYou've also got loops, half pipes, bouncing platforms that launch your ball all over, bank shots off pillars, running along the walls, fake holes that launch you off the course. They've got it all!\n\nIt's a lot of fun playing singleplayer, sadly there are no AI so you're all alone, but it's decent fun.\nBut once you add even a single friend to the game... Oh boy, get ready for one hell of a time! The more you add, the more fun it is.  Exponentially more fun, when on Skype or other method of talking to your other players.\n\nThe dev team for this game is very small, only two people, but they are extremely active in the community discussions, taking suggestions, helping with issues, and are just providing an outstanding experience for their users.\n\n10/10 game, 15/10 devs.","March 5","true","7.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game came out on January 29, 2016. I've played 2 hours of it and already love it. You wouldn't except a person who has 130 hours on Grand Theft Auto V to like an indie mini golf game but I believe it holds a lot of potential. Like I said, this game is super early access and only has 2 courses but playing with your friends is such a great and competitive time. Some people might argue and say that it's super limited and gets boring and they're right, about the first part. But I don't think it ever gets boring! Playing the same courses over and over again offers more fun because of the Online factor. You never know what's going to happen differently when you replay it with friends. That's why I recommend this game to anyone.","February 21","true","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Theres a few custom options to keep the game interesting, different golf ball shapes, altering gravity, jumping, and how bouncy the ground is, to name a few. If you play with the original options, you most likely won't run into any game breaking bugs, however some of the options when customized, may lead to a few holes that are extremely hard. Runs smooth on an Intel HD 4400 integrated gpu on low, at least, smooth enough for me to be able to enjoy it.\n\nIf you dont have friends, there's still enough games on around 7-9 pm EST in the NA region, I can't say I've seen the list empty, however I usually get on later in the day to play.","March 31","true","29.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Theres a few custom options to keep the game interesting, different golf ball shapes, altering gravity, jumping, and how bouncy the ground is, to name a few. If you play with the original options, you most likely won't run into any game breaking bugs, however some of the options when customized, may lead to a few holes that are extremely hard. Runs smooth on an Intel HD 4400 integrated gpu on low, at least, smooth enough for me to be able to enjoy it.\n\nIf you dont have friends, there's still enough games on around 7-9 pm EST in the NA region, I can't say I've seen the list empty, however I usually get on later in the day to play.","March 31","true","29.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Especially if you have friends that don't like the same genre as you do - because everybody knows how to play and enjoys some virtual golf. And if you want it to become crazy fun, just enable ball-jumping and bouncy underground in "Custom" mode and let everybody get creative with their snipes and slam dunks. xD Maybe even add low gravity to the mix. Or play legit minigolf physics in "Classic" mode. All of that you can do in the Early Access build and the two maps are really rich with basic but very diverse courses in two clearly divided difficulty levels where Forest is "Easy" and Oasis is "Advanced". And don't fear 12 player games, you can turn player collision off if you so desire.","April 10","true","4.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Due to it being early access at the moment, you might have a limited experience, but fun none the less. It's a fantastic game to play with your friends (I suggest being on voice comms with them, it's really funny).\nI feel that I can't explain it better than "it's good fun", so here's a list of good and lacking aspects of this game that I have come across in my 7 hours of playtime:\n\nGood:\n- Very easy to pick up and play.  Within 30 minutes of starting the game I was already able to play on a decent competitive level against others.\n- The controls are wonderful. Feels very smooth when you play it and it doesn't take long for you to master the ways of the putt-putt.\n- Stimulating/satisfying gameplay; this is the kind of game I just love to play while watching a movie or YouTube on my second monitor.\n- Playing together with friends is alot of fun and depending on how you customize the game rules, you can get some proper Mario Kart-esque competitive fun.\n\nLacking:\n- As of posting this, there are only 2 maps; Forest and Oasis. There is a big shift in difficulty between the two. Forest is very easy and the pars/hole-in-ones can be memorized within an hour, while Oasis is very tricky and requires alot of good timing. This will no doubt be no issue once more maps have been added.\n- I have experienced a few weird occurrences regarding the physics of the game. Sometimes when you hit a wall straight on, your ball can bounce away at an angle. Sometimes you can suddenly go off a jump and go way higher than you usually do.\n- The server browser is probably the worst thing right now, as you cannot sort the listings in any way, and you have to painstakingly check if the server is in the Lobby and has no password requirements. A way to sort the server list and filter out password requiring servers would be awesome.\nNote: Even though there are these lacking aspects of the game, the good aspects override them most of the time.\n\nAll in all, I'd say this game guarantees at least 3 hours of fun, and much more if you can get a few friends to play with.","April 5","true","12.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Due to it being early access at the moment, you might have a limited experience, but fun none the less. It's a fantastic game to play with your friends (I suggest being on voice comms with them, it's really funny).\nI feel that I can't explain it better than "it's good fun", so here's a list of good and lacking aspects of this game that I have come across in my 7 hours of playtime:\n\nGood:\n- Very easy to pick up and play.  Within 30 minutes of starting the game I was already able to play on a decent competitive level against others.\n- The controls are wonderful. Feels very smooth when you play it and it doesn't take long for you to master the ways of the putt-putt.\n- Stimulating/satisfying gameplay; this is the kind of game I just love to play while watching a movie or YouTube on my second monitor.\n- Playing together with friends is alot of fun and depending on how you customize the game rules, you can get some proper Mario Kart-esque competitive fun.\n\nLacking:\n- As of posting this, there are only 2 maps; Forest and Oasis. There is a big shift in difficulty between the two. Forest is very easy and the pars/hole-in-ones can be memorized within an hour, while Oasis is very tricky and requires alot of good timing. This will no doubt be no issue once more maps have been added.\n- I have experienced a few weird occurrences regarding the physics of the game. Sometimes when you hit a wall straight on, your ball can bounce away at an angle. Sometimes you can suddenly go off a jump and go way higher than you usually do.\n- The server browser is probably the worst thing right now, as you cannot sort the listings in any way, and you have to painstakingly check if the server is in the Lobby and has no password requirements. A way to sort the server list and filter out password requiring servers would be awesome.\nNote: Even though there are these lacking aspects of the game, the good aspects override them most of the time.\n\nAll in all, I'd say this game guarantees at least 3 hours of fun, and much more if you can get a few friends to play with.","April 5","true","12.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Buy it. Right now. Just do it.\n\nThis game is just amazing. I love it so very much, except there is one problem. I have no friends. Just Kidding. Well anyway, back to the review. You might think that you would easily get bored playing the same two courses over and over again, but no, there are customization options. There are so many combinations of custom options, such as jumping, low gravity, and even different shapes for balls. Many of these will majorly change the game. Even if you don't have friends, you can still host your own game and play by yourself. It also has a nice sound track.\n\nFor an early access game, it is incredible. 10/10 Would hole in one then stole out on the next hole again.","May 16","true","10.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Unfortunately, collision mode made me lose all of my friends to golf with. ):\n\nThe current price of $6 is perfect, because there are only two maps. This game will greatly benefit from the eventual six it will have when it leaves early access.

This game is just fun. There's really no other way to describe it.\n\nPros:\nCustomisation - Balls can be customised to a colour and the lobby host can change the physics of the game by changing the ball shape, gravity, bounce height, toggling collisions with other players, etc. Makes for a laugh with low gravity, bouncy eggs.\nSimplicity - The game is simple with a minimalist art style, runs on pretty much any machine very well. Do note that 'Medium' and 'High' settings have their FPS capped, where as 'low' is uncapped.\nFun - Just, fun. Like a game should be.\nAffordable - Definitely worth the price, an absolute blast to play.\n\nCons:\nMaps - only two maps at the moment, however these are very cool. I especially like the Oasis map as it has some really cool features like the river section.\n\nDear devs:\n\nPlease add workshop compatibility later in development, it would be awesome to have the community make custom maps, also please make more maps of your own as I love the level design currently in game!\n\nOverall verdict:\nFun, easy to run, affordable - get it, especially if you like mini golf.","March 17","true","2.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I was on the second hole of Oasis, and my ball stopped on the side of the bowl and just started this slow slide down towards the centre, turning what SHOULD have been a hole in one into a four-stroke before I retired from the match. This doesn't even get into the fact that my jumps are STILL not registering in parts of the Forest. I get that this is early access, and that we should expect bugs, but it seems like every patch that's being put out either breaks MORE stuff, or there's absolutely no change. It would be great if these little wrinkles are ironed out before full-release, but it seems like every "fix" just causes more problems than leaving it alone in the first place.\n\nOverall, it's a great game (Don't turn on collision, unless you want to cost yourself a friend or five).

Early Access is more about lack of content than stability.  My friend and I hit one bad bug in the time we played, but other than that the game is pretty solid.\n\nRight now the biggest draw back is that there are only two maps and only one mode (as of Jan 30th 2016), but as long as more content comes in this is shaping up to be an amazing minigolf game.\n\nThe netcode seems to work without a hitch, but that might be more because that everyone plays their turn asynchronously without having to wait for anyone else.  So 8 player games will go just as fast as a 2-player game, skillset obviously affecting the time.\n\nMy favorite golf games are Kirby's Dream Course and Tee It Up (XBLA) so I've always favored a more arcade type golf experience.\n\nVery interested to see what type of modes open up as the game progresses, like power-ups etc.\n\nPros:\n+Pretty Stable for an *alpha* game\n+Online Multiplayer works great\n+Games are fast without much waiting\n+Auto Spectate after you've finished your hole\n+Level design for the first two maps are very cool\n\nCons:\n-Limited amount of content (which should be fixed provided that more maps and modes come)","January 30","true","0.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The courses are fun especially when your mates don't have a clue where to go and they end up with maximum strokes for that hole resulting in them raging a little ;)\n\n12 player online support is awesome and I can't wait for more courses to be added to the game.\n\n10/10 would break the game again!","April 26","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(You know what I'm talking about if you've seen footage of the game. I don't know what else to call them)\nAlso, the possible customization options in matches are great with my favourite being the possibility to change the shape of the object you're hitting. It gives a very different experience when you try to get a hole-in-one with an egg or a cone.\nThis game is in general an easy way to have lots of fun with your pals.\nI'm really looking forward to the updates for more great content.","May 11","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls use the mouse. This game when played with friends you will those salty moments and hear your friend call swearing you out because you got lucky with that one shot that they cannot make. The makers of this game has a twitch stream where you may submit holes for courses and they may create and play the hole that you designed. This games is where you are able to relax and play a game of mini golf too. The game looks nice and since it is in early access, you can wait for more content to be created. content may be slow at times but waiting isn’t that bad.

TLDR at Bottom\nThis review is mostly compiled from what I have seen on the game's discussions\n\nIt's a really good game for early access with only 2 developers. The devs are very active and friendly with the community and seem to take suggestions/criticism very well. They are very helpful when it comes to helping someone fix an issue. From what I have played I have not encountered any bugs, but if someone is to come across a bug/glitch they can make a post about it on the discussions and relax knowing that the devs will notice it and work on fixing it. There's usually an update with new features around every month, but there seems to be a lot of bugfix updates usually every week at least.\n\nNot much to it as of right now, but that'll change over time. There's only 2 maps currently and they can be completed fairly quickly. Once you get bored of playing the maps on classic you can always do a challenge mode that involves changing the timer or mac strokes for each hole. And if that still isn't interesting enough there's modifiers like ball shapes and so on. It's best to play this game with friends because it's not nearly as fun alone. You can always play online with randoms, but that requires stable internet (that which I do not have) so I don't know how well that is, but I've seen very few people complain about the community or the lag so that's good.\n\nIf you have good internet and friends, then I'd say go ahead and buy the game. However, I wouldn't recommend buying it right now if you're like me and can't play games online. Technically speaking it's unplayable for me due to the fact that you have to be connected to the servers in order to play, but that's more of an issue for me. I'm certain I'll be able to recommend it 100% when they add local multiplayer, bots, and offline play.\n\nTLDR\nGreat game. Amazing devs.  Not much content currently. Worth it if planning to play online. Should probably wait if planning to play offline.","April 15","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But this game somehow managed to catch my eye.\n\nThe game is simple. You have fields, parkours, obstacles, tunnels, slides and every possible shape of object that a golf ball can fit, including the mouth of a sphinx. Your goal is, of course, to make it to the hole with a flag next to it.\n\nIf we have to talk about the aspects that would be expected from a multiplayer golf game:\n\nThe physics are really good. Friction is well-implemented. You can estimate the force while hitting the ball and can safely assume the place you will be landing. With physics being this good, hitting the ball to the obstacles with expecting to have some shortcut suddenly becomes a good idea.\n\nAs a multiplayer game, it doesn't lag at all. Even when there are 100+ people on the server. This makes it a good choice for playing with friends.\n\nThe difficulty for different fields and levels are really well balanced. If you don't be careful with your hits, the chances are you are going to find yourself landed on a mountain of soil. It is really fun to play, especially with a bunch of friends with voice communication. There are times that I find myself alone in a game room which was just full some minutes ago, but it could also be related to the ragequits of my cry-baby friends.\n\nThe game lacks content for the moment. But I can safely bet that the dev is working on it, as I see updates every other day. For a game that is in it's very early stage, this game has so much potential and I highly recommend it.","March 10","true","5.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Easy to pick up, fun to play, a great digital staple for anyone who loves minigolf irl (especially because the physics of real minigolf will never be this realistic and yet still entertainingly silly). It is in really early beta, and the future addition of more courses and a level editor will be more than welcome. On a more personal note, I'm hoping the clouds will be updated to something that hurts me less as an artist in the future.","March 3","true","12.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Even so... I can tell you it's one of the best games I was gifted because I can enjoy it with friends for the price of 6$. A lot of my friends have it and damn playing this while on call on Skype is a ♥♥♥♥in hoot. I am so loud when I play this game. My favorite features about it is collision mode. You can really aggrivate your friends by knocking their ball away from the hole to get your ball in the hole. One of my friends isn't the type of voice to cuss like. He's got a really nerdy voice so when he cusses It makes me laugh so hard. This game is so evil sometimes. I think it's really unique that they added in ball shapes because that is just all sorts of rage quit. XD I look forward to more courses and features when you guys upgrade! I can't wait. I rate this game 5/5 if not more.","May 25","true","7.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

We played the first two course happily, enjoying the unique mechanics and custom modes. And then the third map was added and some changes were made. With the game's current direction, I can no longer suggest it to friends, or even strangers. I can only suggest this to masochists, even with the fixes they made after adding the new map.(which was basically a revamped nighttime version of the first one with bland visuals and annoying traps)","June 5","false","7.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It was a nice and relaxing game you could play while talking to other people. Everyone was happy and we had a really good time. After playing for a couple of days we started to be more and more competitive which wasn't necessarily a bad thing. Instead of just playing, trying to have fun, we now focused on winning and beating each other. After a few more days things slowly started to go south and what started out as a fun activity became the reason why I lost most of my friends. We didn't play to have fun anymore, the only reason we played was to win and to find out who was better at the game. Death threats, insults and tears replaced all the joy we first experienced playing together. Over the course of time more and more of my friends started to quit the game because they couldn't deal with the fear of being humiliated anymore. To this day I still don't know what happened to some of the people I used to talk to on a daily basis, they simply disappeared and no one ever saw them again. I personally feel responsible to inform the public about the risk of buying "Golf With Friends", because it ruined not only my life, but the life of the people I was closest to as well. I'm dealing with severe depression and anxiety attacks on a daily basis because of the insanely competitive environment that surrounded me. I still recieve death threats and letters from people I won against because they want to take revenge. If you decide to buy "Golf With Friends" speak to your parents if you're not at least 18 years old and make sure they are aware of the possible long term effects this game can have on you. If you are old enough please take the time and ask yourself if playing a game is worth risking your health.","May 15","false","27.9"," 4 of 45 people (9%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","9","4","45","23","3"

They knew one of my friends I didn't even know was racist win because he had the confederate flag outside his house. Second game I play had the most cancerous mod ever BOUNCY F*CKING GOLD BALLS(wtf).
