Always a good sign :) ]\n\nRichard Morgan's a talented writer when he's not having to string a plot around pretty lightshows like Crysis 2 & 3 or that empty-headed Syndicate FPS (his Black Widow stories are darn good), so I was intrigued when this appeared on the storefront and figured at the price it would be worth a go. Generally preferring his sci-fi novels like the 'Altered Carbon' trilogy or 'Thirteen', I had read 'The Steel Remains', his first fantasy book and found it actually pretty good, like it was written by a nihilistic Michael Moorcock, though didn't get around to reading the following ones.\n\nSo this game takes place in the same world as 'The Steel Remains', and is a choose-your-own-adventure gamebook with three characters you play in turn in their own parts of the story. It makes reference to TSR's hero Ringil, but you're not playing him so it doesn't mess up the canon. You can adjust their attributes and skills in a character creation screen before the game starts, interestingly picking their sexual orientation as either homosexual or heterosexual. I've not got far enough at this point to see how/if that affects gameplay. Doesn't seem to affect combat :)\n\nThe story starts intriguingly, and the prose is vivid. However, it's riddled with stupid mistakes. "You father", "a children have gone missing", "you suspects they are all fake", "your unable to make up your mind", "making his presence a cold and hard", "you have a clear view on their lips". This is pretty inexcusable for a game that lives and breathes by the text, but if you're willing to overlook it, the story flows well and the characters are better drawn than much of the multi-million polygon NPCs in some AAA games who still have the depth of cardboard cutouts. Some things are silly: the shop screen told me "You have 499 money". Really? Couldn't you have at least written 'Florins', the gameworld's currency? Lazy.\n\nOh, and the 'Exit' button doesn't let you exit. You just go straight back to the main menu. There's plenty of sloppily-left in clues that this was originally a mobile game too: prompts to "tap" and "rotate your device to landscape orientation". Ahh modern gaming, what are you doing to us?\n\nSo why recommend it? Because as shotgunned as it is with the kind of errors you have no right to make once you leave school, the text has a pull and interest that should keep fans of darker fantasy engaged. I already want to know where the plot is heading, and what repercussions my decisions may have. I can overlook subliterate developers for that.\n\n(there's... morally questionable material here, admittedly. But nothing that'll shock you if you've ever watched Game Of Thrones)","May 4","true","2.9"," 42 of 47 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","42","47","4","5"

If you don't, and then enter fail state you must start story from beginning.  There is a note that a 3rd party account is required, but I mistakenly thought that would be for mulitplayer only.   Quitting the game preserves progress so you don't have to complete it in one sitting, which is something, I guess.\n\nThe combat is very thin; the only real value here is the story which is told in 3 alternating parts.  You complete chapter 1 for each character and then cycle back to the first character.  Eventually, you will get to use the entire party, but I did not make it that far.\n\n","May 7","false","2.5"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","2"

A Land Fit For Heroes is based on Richard Morgan’s dark fantasy trilogy of books and like its ancestor, it is first and foremost: a book. You follow the narrative of three characters, all of them, ehm, damaged (to say the least) by reading. You start with Kirellin, a sad ex-soldier with massive ptsd, then you change to Calnar, who is a tribal warrior, abused by his father during his childhood years. Then you change to Ilaria, who is a rootless thief, trying to find herself. You can choose any of them to be homosexual or heterosexual, it does have an effect on the flavor of the story, but not on the main storyline. Lots of details depend on this, like Kirellin’s relationship with Ringil Eskiath, Richard’s main protagonist in the original novels. After reading Ilaria, you change back to Kirellin, and so on…\n\nYour characters will have to cooperate by finding vital information (I’m not spoiling anything about how they communicate, etc) and as the story goes on, the three narratives get closer and closer to each other. Besides reading and making the usual gamebook choices (are you kind to barkeeper? do you kill the thugs?) which have consequences on the later pages, you get to fight battles. Previous reviewers said that the battle is “thin” – I kinda liked it, it reminded me of the old Pool of Radiance-type of games. But I’m above 35, so I like nostalgia, and I don’t have the fingers to click forty times a second, nor do I like FPS games. It is turn-based, you can roll virtual dice, you get to cast spell (after learning it), while learning and using Feats (special short-term powers) gives a small strategic element to each round.\n\nYes, you have to register to the publisher’s database in the game, to save your bookmarks to the cloud. I have no problem with this, though integrating the Steam’s cloud db would have been a lot more elegant.\n\nThere’s also some basic dungeon crawling, using an isometric approach for two characters, which I think is there to boost them before the final chapter, when you control all three of them and fight the Big Enemy together. It is fun, a bit rogue-like: some grinding, loot, some traps and locks to disable (with cool minigames) and then some more grinding.\n\nLike I said, I like this game. It is unusual, the narrative is deep, and even disturbing at some points. The characters are very detailed, so you can easily find yourself liking the anti-heroes of the gamebook, like I did. This game is not for everyone, I guess, but I think it will find its audience!","May 9","true","3.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"
