Game is really fast and hard, maps are beatiful and small, from all sides we are attacked by lots of enemies from small ones to really big ones. What we need do? Survive! To Wave 11 and then kill boss! So we unlock new maps!\n\nThe good\n+ Cheap price!\n+ First game made by Marko (Woah! is really good)\n+ 5 maps!

It's really fun once it's fresh and new to you, but this fun curve dips down shortly afterwards and doesn't recover. The game suffers massively from repetition and tedium, there's nothing hardcore or "semi-hardcore" about this. Where other twin-stick shooters are able to keep things interesting with more perks, enemies and level ideas (ie. Crimsonland) or graphics, or story (ex. Alien Breed, Hatred), Hordelicious falls flat on its face by having nothing particular to offer. By the end of it I was literally bored to tears. World 4 - what were they thinking?! Yes, there are lots of guns but at least a third of them are useless in practice and you want to get rid of them as fast as possible, shooting at the air if need be. Things like Toy Gun or Cupcake Gun or Guitar sound like the developer trying a bit too hard to be an EPIK TR0LL SO RANDUMB, in with the kids. Getting them is fun the first 2 or 3 times but after that it's just rolling ones eyes every time.\n\nIt's getting a thumbs up because I got it dirt cheap on sale and at that price it feels just right acceptable. Aaand I got the achievements. Can't bring myself to recommend it really, consider this more of a "neutral" / sideways thumb opinion.","January 25","true","7.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I won't talk about the gameplay, others have described it well enough. However, I have 2 gripes with this game:\n\n- You can't change the controls and are bound to WASD. Which isn't practical at all when you don't have a QWERTY keyboard. Also, I'm too lazy to change that manually in the .ini that must be somewhere on my computer. So I have to activate the English keyboard layout. Shift+Alt isn't hard to do, but it's still annoying.\n\n- The fullscreen mode isn't true fullscreen, as it doesn't retain the cursor on the used screen. Which means that when you have 2 or more screens, you might end up clicking on the edge of a secondary screen and end up seeing the game get minimized. Of course, it wouldn't be a major issue if the game paused itself when it lost the pointer's focus, but it doesn't. Which means that you will eventually die because of this. And it's very frustrating.  Also, there is no windowed mode as far as I know.","September 2, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is amazing, addictive, and 100% worth every penny. I have enjoyed every second playing this game but I am no longer able to launch it. I have tried reseting steam, reseting my computer, and reinstalling the game and none of it has worked. Whatever bug this is I would love for it to be fixed.","February 19","true","6.0"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
