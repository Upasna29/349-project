You can build teleporters, find a hair dresser in a spider cavern, and get a sword that shoots cats. You can take on the lord of the moon using a yoyo, summon a sharknado minion that shoots sharks at your enemies, and find sky temples where air wyverns spawn. You can buy a music box from a wizard and go record the music that you like the most so you can have it playing in your base whenever you want, and then you can go build a castle made entirely out of white marble.\n\nIt would seem the only thing Minecraft has over this game is 1 dimension. Trust me, once you get used to it and start learning about the game, Terraria is simply one of the most satisfying sandbox experiences out there.

His named was  Markus "Notch" Persson . He made a popular game called  Minecraft , a 3D kid's sandbox game. One of the most popular games ever. Then a man called  Andrew "Redigit" Spinks  made a slightly similar-looking game called  Terraria . Everyone put him in the  Minecraft  stocks and threw horse turds at him for making a "ripoff". Then some stopped and joined him. Eventually, his game evolved into that of the gods and  Minecraft  slowly devolved into the same thing as a boy with cancer that would die if it got chemotherapy.

I would like to apologize for anything that is miss-spelled or any grammar issues. Thank you.\nIf you'd like to skip straight to Pro's & Con's, please move to the bottom of the page. Thank you.\n\nUPDATED EDIT 7/6/2015: With the release of Update 1.3, Terraria has become three hundred times better. Update 1.3 adds in loads of new items, monsters, bosses, events, and more. The new bosses are a really big challenge and very cleverly done. The addition of achievements is addicting to any player who loves to hunt achievements, like myself. Including the new gamemode known as "Expert Mode" which is basically like turning the difficulty up to 'brutal'. Lots of other changes as well, like new textures and sounds, and the new addition of world stats to keep track of how many of each type of monster you kill (Which now rewards you with banners).\n\nHow I Found Out About "Terraria"I found out about Terraria the same way I use to always find games, YouTube. I randomly came across a video called "Terraria". I took a look, and instantly fell in love with what I saw, and knew I had to have the game for myself. It looked like a great combination of gerne' that I love to bits. Being a Minecraft fan since the beggining of Alpha, I knew I MUST have it.\n\nUnfair First ImpressionsWhen ever you ask someone about Terraria, read a review, or watch a video, 95% of the time you hear "Minecraft clone" or "2D Minecraft". Which is incorrect on so many levels. If you have heard this many times, and are thinking twice about actually playing Terraria, please read on as it is nothing like Minecraft.\n\nReview Of Terraria Terraria is a very unique game for what it does. There have been games like it in the past, but the amount of content and play ability is beyond anything I've ever seen before.\n\nTerraria is a sandbox, RPG, action, etc. 2D game. It does it's thing very well. I haven't noticed any UI bugs, or ones that I have, are fixed almost instantly after the patch is released. The gameplay it provides is not only smooth, it is addicting and fun. The combat system in the game is perfect for me, and a lot of others. There are so many enemy types in this game that are not copy paste, each one does their own thing and has their own weaknesses & strength's\n\nExample on the kind of enemies you could come across.\nNormal walking/running enemies, that have a soul objective to charge you until death. These may include enemies like the zombie or skeleton.\nAs there are other enemies who will do the same thing, but in a different way (So not everything is copy/paste.). Like the slime enemy type, which come in many varieties, which will bounce towards you. Or the spider enemy type, which will walk on the ground, but can also climb on the walls to get to you quicker. Just to name a few.\n\n"Well, how do I defend myself against these enemies?"\nGood question. Let's get that.\n\nItems & FurnitureThis is where Terraria gets big. Even though the world's are limited, they provide so much that you could spend 800 hours of game time on a single small world and still have many things to do.\n\nIn the world of Terraria, there are alternate versions of almost everything. What I mean by this is, each world you have will not be the same. For example, there is a 50/50 chance when loading a world to have the default version of something, or the alternate. Such as the music that plays, there are different tracks for the same biomes, just depends on what random one you got. Or for textures on things like, grass, and trees. Also things like ore, in a default world you would have Copper as your basic ore, but in an alternate world, you'd have Tin as your basic ore. What this does is really expands the play time someone can spend in Terraria. Allowing a single person to play the game over and over, and never have the same experience.\n\nBelow the surface are loads of blocks, dirts, ores, and more. Ore like Copper, Tin, Lead, Iron, Silver, Platinum, Gold, Cobalt, etc. And blocks like normal dirt, clay, stone, mud, cobwebs, and so many more. You need these ores to make your weapons and armor. You can find treasure deep underground, that holds many valuable things. You can increase your maximum health by finding Life Crystals underground.\n\nThe weapon range in this game is massive. You even have magic weapons, like spell books, and mana weapons. There are also bows, swords, pickaxes, axes, guns, lazers, cannons, familiars, and so much more.\n\nI won't get into to much detail here, but the amount of content in this game is massive, and it's still being updated. Sure, Terraria has been through some rough times with updates, but when it gets an update, the update is full of new things and changes.\n\nPro's & Con's (Overall Rating)Overall, Terraria is a great game that you can spend hours of time in, and still be having fun in many years to come. It's a steal for the price of $9.99, and especially when there is a sale that lowers the game to $2.00 or less. This game is definitely a choice for sandbox gamers looking for an easy to slip into, addicting experience.\n\nPro's:\n+Loads of content for hours of game time.\n+Great combat system.\n+Smooth gameplay, that's easy to slip into.\n+Provides a good challenge.\n+Fun and creative boss battles.\n+Amazing side events that you cannot resist.\n+Achievements are addicting to those achievement hunters.\n+Expert & Hardcore modes add hundreds more hours of gameplay and possibility.\n\nCon's:\n-No infinite world option. (Doesn't drop overall score - But can be annoying to some players)\n-No easy way to edit worlds before creation (Like choosing whether to have Crimson or Corruption)\n\nOverall rating: Is about a 14.5/15 (Must Own!)\n\nCredits & DisclaimerThank you for taking the time to read my review, I hope this helped out with your decision on whether to make a purchase or not.\n\nRemember, this review is based off of opinion only. You may not think the same way as me towards something, but that's okay, because we are all human.","October 25, 2014","true","654.2"," 1,848 of 1,997 people (93%) found this review helpful 123 people found this review funny","93","848","1","123","100"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sparkeelecaro/recommended/105600/","sparkeelecaro","[R] SparkeeLecaro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sparkeelecaro/","180 products in account","To commemorate the beta of Steam Reviews, as well as passing 1,000 hours in Team Fortress 2, it only makes sense that I finally write a recommendation for a game that has been close to my heart since the day I was first introduced to it: Terraria.\n\nTerraria has proven to be a lot of fun to play, and has been one of my biggest video game time sinks in recent years because of it. Between lenient system requirements, a solid (albeit imbalanced, at times) combat system, a broad permittance for exploration and a wide selection of building decor, it's the type of game that strikes me as having something for everyone. Which is good, when you consider that it also has multiplayer. Even better when you get to the late game, which has a wide array of weapons, armors and tools to allow for a wide variety of specializations.\n\nBuilding and exploration are strong points in favor of the game, but the gameplay mechanics are something I'd like to single out for praise. For a 2D game, its combat system has a lot of spectacle, and perhaps that's part of why I find it so charming. Hurting enemies--even those who are vastly inferior to you--feels good. It's satisfying to hear the hit sound on the more squishy enemies, and watch them explode into fine little chunks when they die. Ground movement could be better, but certain late game items give you the ability to dash and fly, which really expand how you can explore and fight. And with a wide selection of weapons, every player is bound to find a roster of tools, spells and fish-related artillery that fits their playstyle.\n\nThe game isn't without flaws, mind you. With the game's update history, the launch endgame now vastly differs from that of the current one. This has led to some balance and progression issues, the most glaring of which being how sluggish the early game feels. It worries me that the start of the game might dissuade some people from playing, when they might love what the late game has to offer. The game also has a bad habit of recycling mob AI with reskins, though this is averted by adjusting certain parameters and giving them unique abilities to hide the fact. Even though I have more to say about the shortcomings, there's just too much good in the game to stay mad about what effectively boils down to nitpicking.\n\nPlus, it has hats. Any game that has a selection of hats gets brownie points.\n\nWatch some trailers. Read some other reviews. If this looks like something you'd be interested in, then take it from me: give Terraria a chance. The game occasionally goes on sale for 75% off, so pick up a four pack for yourself and three friends. If I'm wrong, then I cost you a meal at Subway--not subliminal advertising--and I'm sorry. But if I'm right, then it'll be well worth the price. We're expected to pay $60 these days for a fulfilling gaming experience. This is one that'll run you $10, at most.","November 25, 2013","true","789.7"," 2,018 of 2,232 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","018","2","2","16"

And it's true, they are both voxel based mining games. However, Terraria tones down a lot of what Minecraft is in building and creativity, then makes up for it in the exciting combat and boss system. Don't get me wrong, you can still build interesting and exciting structures in Terraria, but the awe that some Minecraft creations can inspire is not found in Terraria. If you prefer emphasis on combat, boss battles, and equipment upgrades, but still want to be able to mine resources, create defenses, and terraform to your desire, Terraria is most certainly a good fit.

I met a lot of people and learned so many things through these friendships and communities and practically gone through what seems like the virtual equivalent to my childhood, so wow does this game have a special place in my heart.\n\nPutting my sentimental values in this game aside, content-wise this game is practically everything a fantasy-loving, retro game, sandbox, adventurous and architectually creative enthusiast could ever ask for (see if you're not a fan of any of those kind of games, then you probably might not enjoy this considering the beginning is rather.. slow). Gosh there's just so much to love in this game that I don't even know where to begin, that is, if you give this game a chance. I shall warn anyone who isn't a fan of reading guides that the game in the beginning isn't very intuitive, as it just throws you in the world with no tutorial whatsoever. However there is a Guide NPC, so if you do feel lost on what to do, you should speak to said NPC. The controls of this game is pretty basic; WASD to move, space to jump, number keys corresponding to the hotbar, click to attack, etc.\n\nBut once you got all of that figured out, boy is this game one heck of a ride, especially if you haven't read any spoilers and you have absolutely no idea what will happen next in this gem of a game. You'll be quite surprised with how many things you can discover, how many things you can create and conquer; I definitely recommend you play this with friends as progression throughout the game would be so much more funner, meaning you'll get to the fun stuff faster (i.e. the events and ridiculous weapons and mounts).","October 11, 2015","true","624.4"," 418 of 451 people (93%) found this review helpful 76 people found this review funny","93","418","451","76","19"

You start off with nothing but as you discover Terraria you notice how much is in this game.\n\nStats\nHere are some general stats about Terraria to give you an idea of how impressive this game is.\n\nTerraria contains:\n\n- 2748 Items\n- 401 enemies\n- 76 potions\n- 69 swords\n- 34 bows\n- 30 guns\n- 21 bosses\n\nAs you can see Terraria contains a massive collection of fun.\n\nGameplay\nYou will start off by creating your character and creating your world. A nice feature to note is that you can have your character travel through multiple worlds while keeping their items. You will be thrust into a new world where you will have to gather resources and upgrade your arsenal. Night in Terraria is not as forgiving as Minecraft. After you survive you will continue to build up your personal collection while building a house. You will build a house so that random people can move in take up a room and rip you off with prices (jk not all prices are bad). Eventually you shall fight your first boss and bosses in Terraria will give you a run for your money so you better be prepared guys and gals.\n\nSingleplayer/Multiplayer\nTerraria is a fun game and even more fun with friends. Friends will help you out and make it easier to advance without dying.... too much :D. However if you do not feel like playing multiplayer singleplayer is just as fun. In single player you do not have to share your loot and your friends are incapable of stealing it, because it is singlepalyer.\n\nHardmode\nHardmode is a gamemode that Terraria automatically places you in after you beat The Wall of Flesh. In Hardmode you will meet new bosses and new enemies. You will find new materials and you will quickly realize every is much tougher and you need to quickly upgrade yourself.\n\nRating\nPros\n+ Smooth gameplay\n+ Have not felt lag as of yet\n+ character customization\n+ huge amount of weapons\n+ HARDCORE\n+ entertaining for hours\n+ huge amount of armour sets with special abilities\n\nCons\n- a lot to grasp for a new player to Terraria (I dont think i can think of any more)\n\nFinal Thoughts\nTerraria is an amazing 2D sandbox that tests you. This game has given me hours upon hours of fun and I would gladly recommend this game to anyone who has money in their wallet.\n\nFinal Rating 10/10","June 20, 2015","true","108.2"," 247 of 263 people (94%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","94","247","263","24","8"

What's there not to overlook? The controls are obviously goggle-eyed alien in comparison to the simple 3D-roaming FPS-ness, the graphics look inappropriate for a complex game, and there is an overall feeling that the game refuses to take the "crafting" genre seriously. These were my first impressions.\n\nHowever, after 2 hours into the game, I've started to notice its sleeping greatness - the game is insanely HUGE in almost every aspect!! The worlds virtually span in 4 directions: there are your typical landscape biomes that include Forest, Jungle, Desert, Winter and a few more, each having their distinctly themed caverns underneath, which are biomes on their own, but also there is reportedly more terrain high above in the clouds (25 hours into the game, and I still haven't finished exploring the ground and below-ground level worlds!).\n\nThe amount and variety of the craftable stuff is immense! There is any set of decorative, combat and building equipment imaginable: for starters, there are myriads of building brick types alone! Even the wood has different color, depending on the forest type you chose to harvest. Seriously, imagine a device, a potion or a house equipment - Terraria has it!\n\nThere is also a huge variety of monsters, bosses (although the ones I've managed to fight so far have similar behavior), guarded dungeons, summoning rituals, NPCs (yes, unlike Minecraft - the game offers you to interact with unique characters that appear when you build a new room, with material and complexity of your choice, and which allow you to learn crafting recipes from them, and buy otherwise uncraftable equipment in order to bring balance into the game progression), and the sheer amount of stuff to be indulged into!\n\nAlso, there are genuenly fun combat and adventure aspects - I will never forget our descent to the center of the Underground jungle - a place that changed our characters forever (also, the Queen Bee drops awesome sword!).\n\nIf you have something to like about the game already, but are in doubt, or if you love Minecraft, as well as old-school graphics (represented here with MUCH more effort and finesse, than in most pixelated indie titles of today, virtually making it SNES-grade in terms of quality), my advice is - go for it, and you will inevitably love it. Just be sure to invite some friends (I play with just one, but it is already one of, if not the best, multiplayer experiences I've had in years).","December 2, 2013","true","195.1"," 472 of 540 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","472","540","0","17"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CC67/recommended/105600/","CC67","Felvet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CC67/","87 products in account","Terraria is a sidescrolling sandbox rpg. The game uses procedurally generated maps to provide the player with a unique experience every time. While some say the game is a ripoff of Minecraft it is, imo,  rather a testement to what Minecraft could have been.  The game uses a sidescrolling pixelated style and focuses on the standard rpg fare of collecting items and then using them to explore locations and fight bosses to collect more items. The game focuses less on the creation aspect of sandbox rpg and moreso on the rpg part while Minecraft does the opposite.\n\nWhile the game has a variety of cosmetics and various building materials that simply isn't the point of the game. The point of the game is fighting the boss, progressing to the next level, and getting to, and beating, the inevitable hard mode.  This focus does mean that the game eventually, like all rpgs, dims out and you will find yourself unable to progress and not so willing to farm for rare items. It is an issue experienced by even MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft. Terraria sadly does not come out with enough large updates (Expansions if you wil) to warrent continous playing from update to update.  The bosses are varied and the enemies are fun to fight, the caves are fun to explore etc. Everything you would want from a sandbox rpg game but unlike Minecraft's seamingly endless tracks of land you can easily explore the entirety of your Terraria world. This is sad as some things such as Pyramids, ice caves etc are not going to spawn on every world unlike in Minecraft where it is simply walking around trying to find the right biome. This issue is actually an odd one. As all the creativity in building a house could go to waste when you find there is not teh right biome you are looking for on this world. The act of having to world hop with your character is a poor one and while it is there for a reason the fact that there is a chance you will HAVE to do it is saddening and ruins a portion of the game and breaks imersion.\n\nAnother issue the game struggles with is online play. Unlike games such as Diablo where the enemies grow in strength the more players that are in a single game the mobs of Terraria do not care if as many as 8 people are in their world they will stay the same strength. This makes large parties of friends able to easily chew through a majority of the game undergeared as they may be. And while they require more resources to upgrade there are so many of them to fight and die to kill the boss that it does not neccessarily matter. This means that while playing alone can be incredibly difficult and require alot of pre-planning and execution with multiple people you just kind of gang-bang the boss until it stops moving and drops it's loot. The various classes (Magic, melee, ranged etc) are fairly balenced with Melee providing the most armor but doing the least damage  in and so on in standard RPG fashion.\n\nWhile the game does have issues it is still a great sandbox rpg that can provide hours of fun especially when played with a  few friends so as to keep the game challenging. Defining your character, mineing and crafting your weapons and armor, building a small village for the npcs to live in all feels good and is fun to do either alone or with friends.  I rate the game, in it's current state, a 8.3/10","November 1, 2014","true","184.6"," 386 of 435 people (89%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","89","386","435","16","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CinemaFromage/recommended/105600/","CinemaFromage","CinemaFromage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CinemaFromage/","614 products in account","Oddly enough, Terraria was the first game I'd bought on Steam.  I had been away from PC gaming for a fair amount of time and a good friend had discovered the game on SA and started pestering me to play.  The buy in was dirt cheap and it looked mighty weird with it's retro chic graphics, but I figured if said friend was so fired up about it, I might as well give it ago.  All of the praise I could find at the time compared it to Minecraft, so I was a bit leary.  I'd watched my kid play hours of Minecraft and it just wasn't my bag.  I'm glad I was able to push that stigma aside, because I ended up finding a gem of a game that pulled me away from my fancy consoles for a good chunk of time.\n\nWe've all been kids; kids love to explore.  Exploration is the foundation of Terraria.  You start out with nothing more than a pick axe and a large map, then you're left with simply trying to figure out what's there.  Start to dig, maybe build a house and you're off and running.\n\nThere's something mentally satisfying about being able to click away at the soft earth, digging a path ever deeper.  It may seem pointless, but as you tunnel down, maybe you take a jog to your right and all of a sudden a hidden cave opens up before you.  Dig some more, perhaps you find an underground lake.  Maybe after a few hours of digging, you find something far more sinister.  Then, you spice things up by spinning up a server and letting your friends join you, and now you're working in conjunction, worming your way through the contryside with a misdrected sense of manifest destiny, coupled with the thrill of shouting 'ooh, look what I found!' and getting them to come see.\n\nTerraria's not flashy, but it doesn't need to be.  It's a relaxing good time and it'll bring you a wee bit of the childhood joy of exploring.","July 24, 2013","true","23.8"," 586 of 691 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","586","691","0","9"

Some people complain that this game doesn't have enough content or doesn't get updated enough, and then claim that Minecraft is better (even though Minecraft only has at most 1/4th of the amout of items Terraria contains). Minecraft has had more updates overall and is barely as complex as the coding in this game! There are only a few things I find extraordinary in Minecraft: Creepers, anything involving the Nether, anything involving the End, and anything involving the Mushroom Islands. The list is so much bigger for Terraria! There are even more than 10 bosses and countless enemies that are either semi-original or 100% original. In fact, the only thing I wish Terraria had that Minecraft had was more mod makers and map creators. This game isn't even 'endless' like Minecraft claims, and still packs more of a punch with just a few content updates over the years! I strongly reccomend this game (if you can't already tell). This game should set the standards for upcoming sandbox games: lots of items, the developers stay in touch with the community, and has so many more enemies than any other game that you will be like:\n0_0 WOW.","June 26, 2015","true","286.3"," 361 of 418 people (86%) found this review helpful 69 people found this review funny","86","361","418","69","41"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Quanyails/recommended/105600/","Quanyails","Quanyails","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Quanyails/","20 products in account","Product received for free\n\nThis review is relevant to Terraria 1.3.0.8 and earlier.\n\nThe essence of Terraria is that it prioritizes fun! It's not a game where players must fear losing progress due to forgetting safety measures or manage breakable tools. The game knows how to bring out a sense of enjoyment and achievement. Grinding is an option, not a requirement or an excuse to drag out game time. Besides, there is much to discover and do in the game. Clocking in at 1,000+ hours, having all 88 achievements, and introducing multiple friends to the game should be indicative of that. With that being said, I'll list some pros/cons I've found memorable.\n\nPros\nCustomization: There is a staggering amount of customization available in-game. You not only can choose from several basic character designs but also have a plethora of armors, costumes, accessories, and pets for your character. You can also color/dye any of your equipment and get all sorts of flashy effects. Dyes aren't consumable, too, so you have no restrictions on perfecting your assemblage.\nExploration: The Terraria world may be finite, but it is incredibly diverse. Each biome has its own personality and houses many unique elements. It takes a minimum of three worlds to discover everything, and that's only with absurd luck (see "The Creation of the Guide" painting). The game additionally has an impressive number of flavor. That rubble on the ground can be dug up, and a Worm might pop out from it. You can reignite the burnt-out Campfire in that small cavern. You didn't think that NPCs could fend for themselves during a Blood Moon or invasion, did you? Just when you think you've learned everything about the Terraria world, you discover something surprising.\nCreativity: Terraria is as much as about creating your world as it is exploring it. Blocks and furniture are not just for aesthetics, but they also introduce some neat mechanics. Players looking to engineer stuff will enjoy the contraptions possible by the wiring mechanic, and designers will love being able to paint the overworld with a wide spectrum of colors. Terraria features innovative design at its finest.\nProgression options: Like any good RPG, there's a great sense of progress made in a playthrough. You mine or slay enemies for the materials needed to upgrade equipment, and the world is bountiful enough that this progress never feels linear or constrained. Even the achievements flow nicely, never feeling too easy, cheap, or absurdly difficult.\nYou never need to rely crutch items to make progress. Rather, in my experience, my friends and I frequently had too many options and had to reluctantly store away some of our neat loot. There is always something to switch to if a playstyle becomes easy or repetitive.\nBalance: A game can become boring if there is a certain playstyle players fall into. Terraria manages to find the right balance so that all playstyles have a fair shot at completing the game. There is no bottleneck or singular Infinity+1 Sword needed for progress.\nDiversity: Terraria promotes itself as a game for any type of player, and that claim certainly has truth in it. The game has gameplay suited for battlers, explorers, and builders, and I can also tack on several options that appeal to other types of players. Collectors will balk at the quantity of items and achievements offered, and players can challenge themselves to make progress with nearly any conduct. Play with only melee/ranged/magic/summoning weapons? Sure. A yo-yo only run? That's popular! No crafting/mining? Certainly. Play the entire game upside-down? Of course--and that's bug-free! If that's not enough, you can fire up a world in Expert Mode for the extra challenge. There's something for everyone.\nI've had a friend who would ask on his first playthrough 'Can I do ____ in the game?' and I could answer in the positive the majority of the time. Just for starters, you can teleport, build trap-filled dungeons, set up PVP minigames, and record the soundtrack. The game's breadth is incredible.\nAutomation: Terraria would be daunting without any form of automation. You have thousands of items, hundreds of monsters, dozens of mechanics, and an expansive world to build on or dig through. The game offers much to ease the burden of management. Auto-select picks the right tool rather than requiring manual selection. The smart cursor allows for one-click digging. Quick-stacking is much more convenient than depositing items one-by-one, chest-by-chest. Farming is not only feasible but easy. Making measured builds is simplified with items like the Ruler. The game naturally provides the player ease-of-use tools so a playthrough can be focused on the fun stuff rather than on chores.\nPerformance: Many games fall off a prospective player's wishlist due to system requirements. Terraria is a game that features a crazy amount of sprites, particle effects, physics, lighting, and entity interaction. Being a 2-D game only nets you that much speed before optimizations come into play *cough*Starbound*cough*. The game's requirements are reasonable and the gameplay is optimized such that it doesn't require a bulky system to run on. I was able to run it decently on a 2007 year-old desktop on Windows XP with low-end specifications. The performance of the game to medium- and some low-end systems makes it accessible to a broad demographic of players. On the other hand, if you have a high-end system, go ahead and fire up that Color lighting mode and enjoy Terraria in its full glory.\nQuality of life: Many games have little quirks that people have to accept to enjoy. Not only is Terraria's gameplay mainly devoid of bugs, but it also buffs out these quirks. Players are separated from worlds, allowing for easy singleplayer-to-multiplayer transfer. Characters can ascend blocks without needing to jump. Chests containing items don't explode if you try to harvest them. Keys are easily remappable for those familiar with alternate control schemes. Quick-stacking skips 'favorite' items. You can use the in-game system for taking wide screenshots for giant builds. You can set player configurations to ease the smallest of annoyances. In general, you never feel you're fighting the game's controls and interface.\nContinued updates: It would be very easy for Terraria, as popular as it is, to offer game expansions as paid DLC. The developers, instead, make their continued updates absolutely free to owners of the game. The developer-community relationship is superb.\nCons\nNew player friendliness: The in-game help system is stunted, and players can easily become overwhelmed by the ever-growing number of toys in Terraria's sandbox. Many people resort to a guide to help them through the game.\nGrinding: While the game does not require noticeable grinding to progress, several tangents in the game require patience and luck. That fancy teleportation item pretty much necessitates a farm in the Hallow. The last component of a PDA could be hundreds of monster drops or fishing quests away. At a rate of one quest per in-game day, the 200 fishing quests achievement would require 4,800 minutes (3 1/3 days) to complete without resorting to tricks. It can be frustrating to have an achievement be left incomplete as a stretch, yet Terraria is not above this issue.\nModdability: Terraria is extensive enough that it doesn't need additional features, but people have been able to decode the game and develop external software and mods for a better game experience. It would be a boon if the game was open to the modding community for extended gameplay.","May 17","true","043.4"," 145 of 147 people (99%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","99","145","147","17","15"

Underground hosts greater and cooler enemies, treasures, cave systems, etc.\nBuilding-\nMinecraft- Limited supply of blocks, blocks take up lots of space, the few interesting blocks are impossible to get easily.\nTerraria- Hundreds and hundreds of blocks, blocks stack into higher quantities (M=64, T=999), blocks are easier to get.\nCombat-\nMinecraft- 3 bosses, 5 swords, and a bow. 5 types of armor. Not much variety for pvp, it comes down to whoever has a stronger weapon.\nTerraria- 29 bosses, Swords ranging from shortswords to nyan-cat projectile swords, ranged weapons, magic, summoner weapons, etc. Pvp comes down to who has the most manuverability.\nSo Terraria has more good points then bad, when compared to MInecraft.

I will review the game in some paragraphs, and then I will give it 1-10 points.\n\n[Gameplay]\nIn the beggining, your quest it's to find wood, and make a shelter to survive the first night. "The First Night"-that was the longest nigh in Terraria for me. Then, the game starts getting harder and harder. There are zombies, slimes, skeletones, Bosses and many, many other creatures. It's very interesting game! 10/10\n\n[Crafting]\nAh.The crafting system in this game is quet hard to solve.It was hard to me, I didn't know even how to make a torch.\nThe coolest thing about the crafting system is that, you only need the items for the thing you want to craft, not like in Minecraft, where you need to put every material in some "speacial" position. If you're a new player, talk to the first person you see in the game. Just do it!!! 9/10 It was hard...\n\n[Bosses]\nThis is the coolest part of the game. Beating the bosses! So, The Bosses are made on 2 difficults, Easy and Hard.\nIf you fight on easy difficult, don't worry. The Bosses have like 2k HP to 10k HP. They can be easly beaten up with a good armor and good weapons. IF YOU ARE A NEW PLAYER DON'T START WITH THE HARDMODE! JUST DON'T!!!\nOn Hard mode, the Bosses are very hard, and If you die, you lose the game... Ex. The Eye Of Cthulhu it's on 2,8k HP on Easy, but on Hard mode, the Eyes are two and their name is "The Twins" The one have 20k, the other 23k HP.\nGood luck! 11/10\n\n[Multiplayer]\nOh my God. This is the game I can play with friends forever! It's very funny and when you and the crew get all on HardMode characters and start beating bosses, it's cool. The worstest thig is that, Terraria is made on Small, Medium and Large terrain. This is the worstest thing, not like in Minecraft, to be infinite. But it's a'ight. 8.5/10 Can be better.\n\n[Final Review]\n"Terraria" is a very good game. Even better than Minecraft, lol. So BUY it, what're ya' waiting for? This is an big adventure in a small world, which can be played with friends. What more do you need? 9.5/10 - I highly recommend this game!\n\n*Sorry for my bad english!*","November 8, 2014","true","92.3"," 299 of 348 people (86%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","86","299","348","32","9"

There probably isn‚Äôt much I can say which hasn‚Äôt already been said. Many gamers have heard of it, and many gamers know it is considered to be generally ‚Äúgreat,‚Äù transcending most genre preferences and prejudices. And I now count myself among those people. But the inherent quality of Terraria  isn‚Äôt necessarily that obvious when a total newcomer decides to give it a shot, as the game can be quite uninviting at first. And that is something I want to address.\n\nSo I will tell you, like the thousands of others, that Terraria is an incredibly enjoyable game. It is hard to concisely describe exactly why it is so enjoyable; but it basically boils down to the fact that there is an air of quality inherent to every gameplay aspect and those aspects synergize so well that that quality is multiplied exponentially in the end result.\n\nBut when I first decided to try it, I failed three times to get into it.  Each time I sat down and tried to see what all the fuss was about, but each time I wound up extremely bored and confused as to why I couldn‚Äôt see what was supposed to be so fun about it.  The lack of any clear purpose and direction at the start of the game had me running around with no real incentives, and it ended up feeling unrewarding. Then I played with some new friends online who could offer a bit of direction. We started a new world together and the next thing I knew hours had flown by and I realized that I was finally enlightened.\n\nIt was difficult to get over the initial hump of a learning curve and having a starter character.  There is no tutorial, there are no objectives; simply moving around is tedious at first, the digging is slow, and the building options are minimal‚Ä¶ and it can all feel rather boring. But when you finally start making progress into the game, all the upgrades and item-tiers you climb through feel so gratifying. And I think having that initial slow-climbing grind at the start is a major part of what makes the game so satisfying once you finally delve into the heart of it.\n\nOnce you reach this point of enlightenment, you will be eager to explore all that Terraria has to offer.  Hunt down exotic loot.  Fight epic boss battles.  Build giant castles with thousands of items. Make new friends and enjoy the enormous replayability of playing online. Maybe even try a role-play server. There are many hours of fun to be had.\n\nPerhaps the only negative aspects worth noting are the simplistic graphics and the lack of any clear story-mode. But due to the great gameplay and nature of the game, both of these things are easily dismissed as a non-issue by most. That said, if you really like story-driven experiences and/or gorgeous, current-gen graphics, you definitely won‚Äôt find those here.\n\nSo in short, Terraria is something that can be easily enjoyed by almost any gamer. If you haven‚Äôt yet given it a go, you should probably consider it. It is a pretty safe bet for all but the most extremely discerning gamers. Just don‚Äôt forget that it may feel boring at first, but it is worth fighting past it; and playing with some people online can make it significantly more fun, especially when you are new.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","April 14","true","48.4"," 151 of 162 people (93%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","93","151","162","16","7"

It also never lags, one of my pet peeves.\nI espessially love all of the machines and bosses. This is a true sandbox game, Thank You Terraria.","November 7, 2014","true","284.2"," 226 of 261 people (87%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","87","226","261","14","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GetOutNowDontStayLeave/recommended/105600/","GetOutNowDontStayLeave","Jack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GetOutNowDontStayLeave/","605 products in account","Terraria, the best sandbox game on Steam. Well, that is obviously my opinion and to me, it holds true. The first thing you should realise about Terraria is that there is no real "story" to the game. Besides collecting resources, building a base and most of battling the fierce monsters that Terraria has to offer. And oh BOY does it have monsters. I think the best place to start this review would be talking about what I love about the game and what I sometimes wish was worked on a little bit.\n\nFirstly, what I really love about this game is the sense of accomplishment. And I don't mean accomplishment as in "congrats, you killed a single enemy here's 100 great items and 20 achievements". I mean accomplishment as in you fight your hardest and kill a boss which you've been grinding for (will expand on this point later), which gives you a good item. Now, once again, when I say a good item I in no way mean game winning or game breaking items. I mean items that should carry you through until the next boss and the cycle continues.\n\nNow, as I said earlier about grinding. Yes, this game does have grinding in it. However I deem it necessary to explain how grinding i this game differs to grinding in an RPG. First and foremost, yes this game will require a bit of grinding just to get something new and helpful in your quest. However you must not worry. If you choose to grind alot, which I know most people will choose to do, you will get better gear. However if you just run in and collect all ores that you see and kill everything that wants to do harm towards you, you'll still get good stuff; stuff that will help you defeat the next boss. So, to sum that up let me put it like this; This game doesn't require you to grind, just to dig and collect everything that you need for that next big battle.\n\nSpeaking of bosses, this game has multiple (14, to be exact!), all of which are unique. I'm going to talk about 3 of the main bosses that you'll be seeing early on in the game. Those 3 bosses are Eye of Cthulu, The Eater of Worlds (The Brain of Cthulu on Crimson worlds!) and Skeletron. Each of these bosses are VERY unique. Now, whilst I don't want to spoil these bosses, I think the best way to describe them is like this:\n- Eye of Cthulu is a giant eye boss which charges you down and enters rage mode after a certain amount of damage is dealt.\n- The Eater of Worlds is a giant worm which will home in on you as you destroys it's segments, each dropping loot.\n- The Brain of Cthulu is a giant brain (suprisingly!). It spawns eyes which have to be defeated before attacking the actual brain itself.\n- And finally, Skeletron. Skeletron is a monstrous skeleton, with 2 hands which can be destroyed to make the fight easier.\nWhat I really love about these bosses is how different they all are from each other. End game bosses are equally amazing, but may require a giant WALL to be passed. Could cause a lot of FLESH wounds, if you catch my drift. End/Hardmode bosses are amazingly well done and should honestly is one of the most well done things in this game.\n\nEnough about the bosses, let's talk about weaponry. There's a multitude of weapon TYPES to choose from. Melee, Ranged, Mage and Summoner. And the amount of weapons within each catagory is well.. It's insane to be quite honest with you. If you're not enjoy swords, why don't you switch up to a staff which spews magical balls of damage to your foes? This game has a wide selection of weapons to choose from, and with that you also get the different armour types to help you. Once again, armour comes in a multitude range; Melee, Ranged, Mage and Summoner. Now, some people may not exactly understand what the classes are so let me help you understand what they are.\n- Melee is predominantly swords and some other weapons like maces and things like that\n- Ranged is mostly bows, guns and all the things like that.\n- Mage is staffs, books of magic and guff like that.\n- Now summoner, is where people probably don't understand what it is. Summoner allows you to summon minions to help you fight, like Slimes, Ravens and Pygmys.\n\nFinally, where this game kinda falls short. I mean, it's nothing 100% game ruining. Achievements. OKAY, OKAY, LOWER THE PITCHFORKS, ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN MYSELF! I love the achievements in this game, they're fun, rewarding and allow me to play a different way in the game. But some of them are just so damn grindy. I mean, I think if you've played this game you understand where I'm going with this; the God damn Angler missons. I don't want to spend my time fishing when I could be fighting badass bosses and having a ball of a time. I don't want to fish. It's not as if it's just 5 or 10 times. It's 250 times. I don't want to fish for that long.\n\nLook, this game is damn near perfect and there's no way I can deny that. The constant work the devs put in is astounding and I must say that it's amazing the time and dedication they put into it. And, well, it paid off. This review is simply a slither of what the game is. And with that, I bid you all goodbye and farewell. I hope you have an amazing day or night dependant on your timezone!\n\n\n\nEnjoy the review? Please consider checking out my curator!

This is something different though. It combines the adventurous feeling of "path of exile" and the 2D yet amazing type of art of "starbound" and "edge of space". This came as a gift from my brother. He noticed that I was getting kinda left out because a few of my friends could play it and I didn't have it, so he spent his own money, or steam credit, to buy me this game. It is worth the cost and will bring you a lot of enjoyment. Thanks bro.\n\nMany people would call this "2D Minecraft" and "pointless, silly and plain rubbish". I however disagree, as this game has more enemies, bosses, items, biomes and many more. This game is out on many platforms and I simply love this game. 9.5/10. I would like to give my thanks to re-logic and the rest of the group for this game. It is astoundingly beautiful.\n\nI shall now talk about the gameplay. You may customize your character's original look, and can have extra items in your accessories bar to increase strentgh, allow double jump, save you from from injuries by dodging, etc. You also have a vanity bar to put on cloths over your armour, therefore letting you have a nice amount of defense without clamping down on your style. You have a bigger inventory and hotbar than minecraft and better items, too. You can be wearing a big bulky helmet made of toughened mushroom while also wearing a rainbow coloured bowler hat. I personally collect hats as a hobby, so I could wear a turquoise fez or boater while also have on a high end helm. The multiplayer allows pvp, and it's own version of ctf (capture the gem). It also has teams, allowing you to play pvp in a group if your friends without killing each other. This game has a wide range of NPCs, ranging from an arms dealer to a party girl. The nurse can be a bit rude though... But I don't care. She gets the job done. You can build a condo by the ocean, or a mansion in the roots of a tree. You can hollow out hell, or reside in the clouds. You could even build a secret hideout hidden in a lava pool. The crafting is fun, you can make potions easier than in minecraft, and the traders don't go "HMMM". That is an automatic upgrade.I just love this game, and if anybody says that it is bad, then I have a tear run down my cheek. Just joking.\n\nI would like to thank: Redigit, D-town, Cenx, Crowno, Will, Aaron, Jim, and anybody else who helped make this game. I have changed my rating from earlier: 10/10. Terraria has a lot of potential, yet is still a FANTASTIC game.\n\nAnyway you look at it, it is full of colour and beauty. Thanks. This is a true game.","October 29, 2014","true","568.3"," 201 of 233 people (86%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","86","201","233","12","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thomashenryguy/recommended/105600/","thomashenryguy","thomashenryguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thomashenryguy/","63 products in account","I sometimes find myself envying people who sit down to play an outstanding video game for the first time. It's like a Christmas morning: putting the toy back under the tree and tearing opening the box all over again will never quite replicate the excitement of seeing it for the first time. Terraria is this sort of game. Starting a new world with a new character still feels like an exciting adventure, but the experience of stepping into that bright two-dimensional world for the first time, and discovering piece-by-piece all that it has hidden, is worth the asking price all by itself. Subsequent playthroughs only add to the value, and how! And if it's on sale - it is, often - I can only advise you not to hesitate.\n\nTerraria is a very versatile game. You can play for hours at a time, clocking up days' worth of play, and still have a 'to-do' list as long as a Bone Serpent. Alternatively, you can casually dip in and out when the mood suits you, building a little here, digging a little there, working on some great artifice a bit at a time. You can challenge gods and monsters with the finest weaponry crafted from the rarest metals, or simply make a treehouse for all your NPC friends with matching furniture sets and mood lighting. Become an arctic explorer! Go fishing! Drain the ocean into the dungeon! (I have actually done this, it was hard work but good fun.) Go to hell - literally! You can try to be bored, but it will take a lot of effort.\n\nOne of the advantages Terraria has over so many other games is the involvement of a dedicated development team. When updates come  - and they may not come forever - they add great stores of content to the game, with new NPCs, items, mechanics, enemies and locations, not to mention all the tweaks and fixes which aim at keeping everything balanced, no small feat given that every change has to keep Terraria accessible to new players, whilst offering bigger and better challenges to existing players whose kingdoms span from ocean to ocean. This is all done remarkably well: the devs maintain a good community, and there is always the sense that the players are being listened to when new content arrives, without ever compromising the creative vision behind it. In an age of cowboy developers, corporate spin and micro-transactions on every street corner, Terraria is a welcome example of good practice in video games, and if I needed to buy it again, I would quite happily pay the full price - although, as I said, sales do happen.\n\nOf course, nothing is perfect, and nothing is for everyone. When it comes to armour and weapons, and things forged out of fantastically rare ores, it can be very 'grindy' (if that's a word). Building anything of any real size takes time, as does the collection of large quantities of wood and stone and whatever else you may be using to put together your palace. Boss fights can take a lot of preparation, and the later-stage bosses can feel genuinely punishing when attempted repeatedly. As a rule, I find that Terraria is very good at compensating for these issues, (a quick trip to collect wood for house-building can turn into a hectic race through zombie-infested tundra, or an expedition to recover unknown loot from the bottom of some murky chasm,) but not everyone will want to give it their time. A mere two dimensions may be a deal-breaker for some, not to mention the rather old-school, pixel-y art style. But even if this sounds like you, I recommend giving it a try. For me, Terraria worked where Minecraft didn't, and I still feel that the former deserves some of the credit that is typically heaped upon the latter. So give it a go, walk around that forest for the first time, dig a little below the surface and see if the spirit of adventure takes you. If it does, keep digging - after one year and 262 hours of play, I still haven't stopped.","November 19, 2014","true","618.9"," 130 of 140 people (93%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","93","130","140","12","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Crazher/recommended/105600/","Crazher","Crazher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Crazher/","3275 products in account",""2D Minecraft" - It is a thought almost everyone has had (and anyone claiming otherwise are lying to themselves), but Terraria is much more than just that, and here is why I recommend it.\n\nTerraria's world is literally designed as a Terrarium, you start somewhere towards the middle of your world, and whether you go left or right - you will eventually stumble into an "ocean" with an invisible wall a little ways out. You have a couple options, build a base, and start exploring the surface, or you start mining and spelunking through the cave systems.\n\nTerraria's surface contains a little less than a dozen different biomes for you to explore and utilize as grounds for your home base (or outpost), and you will stumble into various enemies throughout them, and even sometimes fight the biome itself (Cure the corruption/crimson, or heck even help it spread!). Be sure to build shelter for the night as monsters are prone to hunt you down. Additionally there is also the chance of events happening, such as the goblin invasion.\n\nThroughout its underground system (which can be around 2000 blocks deep) you will find mini-dungeons, deep cavern systems and even bosses at times. And of course, we have a hell-ish biome at the very bottom filled with lava and demonic creatures.\n\nAnd when you think you have done it all? Defeat the boss in the hell-biome and start a NewGame+ esque event that makes everything in your world harder - even the bosses.\n\nSo is Terraria recommended? Hell yes. For $10 (it's been on sale as low as $2 if you're on a budget) you will literally get days (or weeks!) worth of gameplay, and even more so if you have friends to play with!

Dig like a boss.\n\nThis is one of, if not THE best values on Steam for the amount of time you can play it vs. the money you will spend.\n\nTerraria has had two massive updates for free already, as well as both a Halloween and a Christmas update that added many more items, enemies, events, and bosses as well.\n\nThe game caters to most gamers in that it has several ways to enjoy the game.\n\nExploration, mining, and item collecting is a big part of the game. With the 2 major updates, and the two season ones the game has hundreds of items to find, get from bosses, and simply craft. For the item collectors out there you can spend a good 50-100 hours searching for all of these alone. You can find and craft armors, melee weapons, ranged weapons, and magic weapons. You will be able to find and craft dozens of accessories that can be improved and combined with others. You can plant gardens for potion ingretients, find special keys to unlock more chests, banners, paintings, statues, etc. for decoration. You can even craft dyes to allow you to change the color of your gear and paints to change the color of your blocks.\n\nBoss fights are for the more action orientated players. The game has 2 modes. You start in the normal, or "easymode" we all call it with just a handful of bosses that shouldn't be too difficult for you once you learn the mechanics and have upgraded your weapons, armors, and accessories. After defeating a certain boss in this mode the game will enter into HArdmode. This is where the more challenging enemies and bosses appear. You also will get access to much higher level gear and you will have much much more to find.\n\nThe real longevity of the game, however comes in the crafting and building aspects of Terraria. AFter you have dominated all the bosses and mined all your ores, found your gears, etc. you can still spend hundreds of hours designing and building massive towns and structures. The game even has a bunch of wires and mechanical items that you can set up to do things such as teleport! The building aspect is most certainly my favorite part of the game.\n\nNot only can you do ALL of this alone in single player, but Terraria has CO-OP/Multiplayer! You can do everything you can in the single player mode, but with friends! Share and trade items with others, go and fight bosses together, or join together and create a massive art project, or city. Look around the net for Terraria artwork. There are truly some pehnomenal art designs by the Terraria players out there.\n\nTerraria is one of my favorite games I have on Steam and is one that every STeam gmaer should own. The game goes oon sale regularly at 75% off so you can get it for $2.50 regularly. It's a steal even at full price.\n\nAlso, don't forget to check out Terraria Online for the wiki and the modding community. This game has a very nice and active mod community. So even after all of this you can still get mods too!\n\nThe game also has trading cards.","November 30, 2013","true","730.3"," 101 of 113 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","101","113","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ScorpsTheScorpio/recommended/105600/","ScorpsTheScorpio","ScorpioTheConqueror","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ScorpsTheScorpio/","111 products in account","Terraria, Terraria, Terraria. Old old Terraria.\n\nI used to play this game with my sister and my friend on my server, it appears I played almost 140 (138) hours of this game and it was pretty darn good.\n\nTerraria is a sandbox sidescrolling indie RPG with a lot of crafting needing to be done but it is NOT a Minecraft copy in any stretch of the imagination, no no no. To some, it could even be better.\n\nTerraria features a huge amount of enemies, items and bosses all of which are incredibly designed. It also features funky 16 bit style music which is pretty awesome.\n\nFirst off and perhaps my favourite feature and the reason I love the game are the amounts of items, there are so many magical items almost all doing something unique and different such as a harp which sends out musical notes to attack your enemies or a wand which shoots out a beam which you control with your mouse. Let's just say the designers are very creative fellows indeed.\n\nNext off and my second favourite thing are the incredible amounts of bosses! From a giant worm to Cthulu's old eye, there is no limit to the amount of randomness and awesomeness you can find in this game.\n\nHowever, Terraria still has it's flaws. And one flaw is very big and slightly game ruining to me and why I don't play anymore.\n\nThere is a large amount of grinding involved. Certain enemies drop certain items (Skeletons and Piranhas used to/still do drop hooks, but only Skeletons and Piranhas) and some have very low drop rates. Again, this might have been fixed. However, that was merely one floor amongst many positives.\n\nBack to the positives: One thing I forgot to mention was the housing system. Whenever you make a compatible house (You can't just make a random crevasse and expect it to work, you need to create a proper actual house) an NPC will move in, but only after you complete the achievement which will earn the NPCs respect, such as kill a boss which I think you needed for the Dryad. There are many, many NPCs for you to get and they all sell different things and say funny things, especially the Nurse who seems to have a crush on the Gunslinger, but again nothing is done with that. Don't expect cute Guide X Dryad crap to happen, sorry shippers. That'd be cool, if couples could actually happen or you could spy on the conversations between two or more NPC's.\n\nThere is a huge amount of enemies to battle from flying eyes to unicorns, they're all unique and it'll take you a lot of hours to get bored and want new enemies, and not to mention the amount of hours you can put into this game is INSANE. It'll take estimated 200 hours and over (Don't quote me on that) to see every little tiny bit of content, if not 300 hours. But once you're done with that I'm not sure if you'd want to come back to it.\n\nAnd finally... The combat system. It's very basic, especially melee wise. But once you get late into the game you'll find all kinds of unique swords and magic items that'll mix everything up.\n\nAnd the final verdict for Terraria is... 6.5 out of 10. I feel bad for not ranking it higher, but the grinding (and the fact that it's not really my kind of game altogether) causes it to be a 6.5/10, which is a 'great game!' to me.\n\nUntil next review :) Bye!","November 7, 2014","true","139.4"," 149 of 181 people (82%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","82","149","181","16","3"

It just becomes more enjoyable each hour... and with each boss killed. Even if you finish the game multiple times, I‚Äôm sure anyone would still find something new to do. The first few hours may be boring (I think it‚Äôs boring, personally) but after some time you realize how great it is. The developers did a great job on keeping the game alive with new content every few months. It really does have a lot of content and they are now working on Terraria: Otherworld.\n\nIf you have friends to play with it‚Äôs even more fun. Also you can speed up the progress by playing with them, which is always good. The 1.1, 1.2 and the 1.3 updates were the biggest updates to the game. If you played the game before ATLEAST the 1.3 update, you know how much content they add to the game. Even if you started playing the game after the 1.3 release, you will notice the huge amount of content.\n\nI had lots of fun playing this game and the hours put into it was well worth it. I might not play it ever again but since I have lots of other games to play I just don‚Äôt have time for it.\nAt the end, it‚Äôs great and I‚Äôm SURE 90% of the people on steam has this masterpiece in their library. If you don‚Äôt own it, what are you waiting for?!

There are a few overpowered things here and there (such as the very early obtained gem grappling hooks with massive range) but it's a very solid balance over all. Lots of objects you will find will already be useless because you've found better, but each time you play through the game, who knows, you might just happen upon an item earlier than usual.\nWhat you'll want to play this game for is the multiplayer. Playing alone is all well and good, but playing with friends, building projects with them, that's what can't be beaten. The bosses are incredibly difficult to beat alone anyway, so it'll make your life a lot easier to work with others. I seem to always manage to get a lot more hours from this game every time someone new decides they'll play it with me.\n\nFinally, a suggestion. 1. Get this game. 2. Play on a LARGE world. Small worlds run out of space to explore quickly, and it'll mean anything you build isn't kept, because when you finish exploring a world, you'll want to go to another.  Sky islands will be more difficult to find, and you'll have to build outposts close to the dungeon and the jungle so you don't keep having to run from your original spawn, but it's worth it. It'll also mean the corruption won't spread over your house as quickly once you get into hardmode.","January 14, 2014","true","924.5"," 76 of 80 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","76","80","0","1"

To have an honest review here, Terraria is pretty boring when you first play it. Right? I'm sure everyone would agree with that one. BUT, as you play it more, it starts to get more addicting to you because you realize the wide variety of opportunities you can do inside the game. MEANING, you can do things like spawn more than 1 boss and fight them all at the same time, (The bosses are pretty beast btw) you can get a lot more loot (Swords, spears, yo-yo's, summoners, magic, guns!?) and even build really nice buildings to show off! You can also change the color of your character with different dyes for your armor. The dyes aren't just normal colors though, most of them have very unique mixtures that can make your armor look VERY impressive (around 30 unique and exclusive dyes, not just generic plain colors.) I myself have spent the first 2 weeks on this game ONLY. (Fitting in about...100 hours those weeks) so it's pretty obvious that to ME it was such an amazing game, with so much amazing loot and bosses. And there's a lot more where that came from. The game also has an excellent soundtrack, the music gets even better the farther you get in the game.  Anyway, thanks for reading the review, hopefully maybe I changed your mind about the game, (If I didn't it's completely fine.) but I strongly recommend it. Just remember, you will not regret buying this game if you AT LEAST make it into hardmode.\n\nHonest Rating: 9.5/10","May 7","true","278.7"," 75 of 80 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","75","80","7","3"

And the first game I ever bought on this platform. That was about 2 years ago.\n\nWhile it might be tempting to dismiss Terraria as a simple 2D Minecraft knockoff, its heavy focus on sidescrolling combat, boss fights, and crazy weaponry reveals just as large a debt to classics like Metroid and Castlevania. It clearly rests on the shoulders of giants, but is this enough to render Terraria a satisfying experience in its own right?\n\nAs with Minecraft, you start your adventure by exploring a randomly generated landscape where you gather resources and build shelters in order to protect yourself from the hostile creatures that come out at night. Don't expect much in the way of a tutorial--while you can pick up some random tips from an NPC that follows you around, you're essentially left to figure out how to play the game on your own. Once you do, however, you'll find that you can build fortresses and craft weapons and other items with ease, and you'll even attract helpful NPCs such as merchants and nurses if you build homes for them.\n\nYet Terraria is less about assembling monumental structures and more about crafting gear and fighting monsters. And the monsters are everywhere. During the day, you'll be hounded by lightweight slimes whose persistence makes building even the simplest structures a challenge, and during the night, you'll have to endure hordes of relentless zombies and floating eyeballs that batter your fortress.\n\nBut the real challenges lie deep below in the underworld, where you'll dig tunnels to battle giant worms, skeletons and other horrors that drop the rare materials needed for the best upgrades. Gather enough materials, and you'll be able to craft a surprisingly eclectic arsenal that includes grappling hooks, lightsabers, and boomerangs--all of which will come in handy when summoning and battling the game's bosses. And if you find that it's a little too dangerous to go alone, you can always play with your friends in multiplayer.\n\nIn the end, Terraria presents an experience similar to Minecraft, but it manages to distinguish itself with a heavy dose of breakneck fun that Minecraft often lacks. There's something for everyone here, and a host of free updates, a polished retro presentation, and a reasonable $10 price tag make this sandbox more than worth digging into.\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","October 6, 2014","true","385.9"," 118 of 143 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","118","143","7","7"

It's really awesome but not perfect:\n\nPros:\n+Tons of things you can spend your lifetime doing for (searching for extremely rare drops or collecting all boss trophies like me)\n+With friends this game is just perfect because of the epic boss fights and actually making tactics against bosses (hell bridges for WoF and stuff like this)\n+graphics are pixels that have been done very well with a lovely simple style\n+Game is really easy to mod. You just create your own sprites or just recolor olds and copy/paste their .ini files in a mod folder. (It sounds hard here but this game has literally one of the easiest modding there is)\n+Tons of potential to become more awesome\n+Never lacks content\n+Boss fights are something beautiful\n+Has funny items (example: Christmas Tree Sword, Sand Cannon, Swordfish) but also epic items, and even beautiful items\n+Hundreds of hours of gameplay time\n+Softcore for people who hate in Minecraft that you lose all your gear if you die. You just drop half of your money you carry on that moment\n+Able to recall to your spawn point with appropriate item/items (Magic Mirror, Recall Potion)\n+Tons of roles you can get into like in RPG (Healer, Tank, Warrior, Ranger, Mage, Summoner)\n\nSomething that's pros and cons at the same time:\n+/-Is fun in singleplayer but it lacks the fun multiplayer brings\n+/-Some mobs do damage like ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• even though they aren't bosses\n+/-Playing with a lot of friends is a struggle to find resources sometimes\n\nAnd now the cons (God I hate this part):\n-Even large world is really small for exploring (approx 13,000 Ft from end to end)\n-Mid-phase in game is really REALLY hard, but lategame with proper items is just too plain easy (i.e. you don't even need to avoid boss hits)\n-Never finding Magic Mirror\n-Some enemies resist KB (knockback) like ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and thus makes early-game Warrior extremel difficult.\n-You need to git gud in this game before you actually can survive to endgame.\n\nMy overall opinion is that I love this game way too hard. I have modded the game and I have played the game from 2012 (cracked version I admit pls dont hit me). This game never lacks fun and something to do unless you really have done everything in the game which takes hundreds and hundreds of hours to do. I have played this game for over 300+ hours (if cracked version is added up too) and I still miss a lot from the game.

At least there is the hardmode which opens another bunch of items and possibilities.\n\nIt's too much to discover, so that there is even a wiki out there: http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Terraria_Wiki\nThe game is fully worth its price. If you play with your friends together in the same world the fun is more than doubled.\n\nUpdate: The new 88 achievements in the 1.3 version make it even more challenging to tryout the hardmode and rise up the complete  techtree.

The guide explains few basics of the game and gives few tips that can help you out but he can also be a gentleman and open the door to your house to fellow zombies, because, let's not be rude to the guests shall we and let them have a fair meal of brains.\n\nIn Terraria, exploration is the key. Chests and a multitude of other nice loot lay down underneath the layers of dirt and stone, which is completely wonderful. But not only that... the most amazing feature... POTS. YOU CAN SMASH POTS. The dream of smashing all the pots in your way has come true, they come in all variations! Pots, so many pots to break! But not only that- they hold rope, coins and more, something else really nice. Rope is useful when exploring caves at the very beginning, since you don't have a grappling hook of any sort and the wood platforms and others just don't do it. Rope is your ally.\n\nThen comes the most important objective- mining of the ores. You'll need them to start crafting better gear for a better protection and damage, so you don't get destroyed by powerful creatures and advance to the corruption where you'll have even more business to attend there. It's up to you to explore, Terrarian!\n\nGraphics\nAnother feable comparrison to Minecraft is the pixelated art style. However, I have to disagree. Minecraft's visual aesthetics are based upon blocks just like Terraria. Though, Terraria has a lot more dynamic designs and aesthetics, and a much more vast colour pallet to boot. The art style is simple, yet very eye catching and has its own identity. Most sprite games try to base their style on games like Mega Man or Mario. Terarria, however, has its own style that is unique to itself. When you see the art and sprites, you don't think Mega Man or Mario. You think Terarria.\n\nTerarria also boosts a lot more visually stunning and diverse environments. The world also seems just so much more alive. Since this game is a sidescroller, the designers don't have to worry about Z axis. Because of this, Terarria has a lot more intricate world and level design and is a lot more vertical than its Mojang-created counterpart. Terarria also features a lot more enemies and NPCs than Minecraft. This game just feels alive and there's always something interesting on the screen, whether you're in the forests or deep underground. This game is just a joy to the eyes.\n\nOST & SFX\nProfessionally done sound effects so you can get the most out of your gameplay, and awesome chiptune tracks to keep you going with the mood! Absolutely love the tunes and I look forward to buying the official soundtrack, it's that awesome! The rain and snow biome tracks are the best in my opinion, check both of them out on YouTube.\n\nTerraria OST Rain\nTerraria OST Snow\n\nShould you buy it?\nYes, you so should buy it! It's worth the full price for all the content it has to offer and fact is- it will offer even more on the plate soon enough.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group:  Original Curator Group","March 5","true","100.0"," 48 of 53 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","48","53","2","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trancator-official/recommended/105600/","trancator-official","Vokun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trancator-official/","62 products in account","Terraria,\nA game about you, trying to survive the world of? Terraria, build and fight your way up to the end, you just start off as a person, only carrying nothing but the basic tools, and there you are. Deciding what your first step will be, will you go collect wood? Or immediately dive into the horrors below! It's all your choice in terraria.\n\nThere's a lot to do.\nWhat will be your first step? What will you do to become the Lord of Terraria? Well, the distance between  you and that tittle, is... let's say, pretty big, you got lots of things to do before you're done, and that is what keeps you playing.\n\nAmazing gameplay.\nThis is not just your average game, you got to use tactics, in fact, this game and its playstyle will keep building up. Though it can be frustrating sometimes, but aren't a lot of games like that?\n\nHours and hours of never ending exploration.\nOh? You're done finding what you wanted? There's always something else, waiting to be obtained. Maybe it's a rare drop? Maybe it's just an easy-to-get item that you badly want. However, you're never done trying to find whatever your heart desires.\n\nAmazing boss fights.\nNow, how can you be the 'Lord of Terraria' without proving it? You can't. That's why there are these strong foes that will challange you, all you have to do is defeat them. Sounds simple you may think? Well, it gets harder, but when it does, you'll find much better weapons and accessories. Some of these bosses are pretty challenging and require a good strategy.\n\nWonderful soundtracks.\nNot only is the environment of this game beautiful, but the soundtracks just finish it off. You're in a nice green forest, and what is the first thing you want to hear? Something peaceful. The soundtracks have all, their own special message, rather you're fighting a boss, exploring the caves or just wandering around at night. They all have their way of saying: "This is where you are."\n\nChallenging dungeons and caves.\nIf exploring the surface became boring, and you got bored? Then digging your way underground will have you exploring a lot longer! Mining these precious ores to craft materials or maybe some armor and weaponry to protect yourself. But, are you able to survive what's waiting for you down here?\n\nAwesome weapons and items.\nIn this game, you have to be able to defend yourself. But how? With weapons of course! Do you like to slash your opponents with a mighty sword? Then crafting a good sword is the first step! Oh? You prefer to stay a safe distance away from your opponent? Well, that is possible! A bit later in the game you can own yourself a gun! But? What if you love to use magic? Is that even in the game? Well, it is! Either you can be a mage or a summoner! Wait, what's the difference you ask? Well, a Mage uses magic to fight and defend himself, a summoner on the other hand, summons creatures that will fight for him. However, magic items aren't quickly obtainable when you first start. But the time will come won't it?\n\nAn epic final boss.\nFinally! You've defeated every boss! But... what is that? You feel a strong presence around you, as the final battle is about to come... you know... that you are not finished yet, for yet, to become to Lord of Terraria, you have to defeat the one who is... and that... is.......\n\n\nSomething you'll find out on your own, spoiling it now would be rather pointless now wouldn't it? But what I can tell is, the items that this Lord will drop are very strong, and with these items, you can call yourself, The Lord of Terraria!\n\nNow, that was it. I hope you liked my little story.\nPersonally, I just love this game. And I highly recommend it for those who love exploration and survival games. I hope this helped you a bit too see what Terraria is about and what it has to offer.\n\nUntil then, I hope you'll have a good time playing and becoming, The Lord of Terraria!\n\nHave fun!","January 2","true","449.5"," 49 of 56 people (88%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","88","49","56","7","10"

Good thing is, every new world you generate, differs drastically from the last one. You‚Äôre getting randomly generated dungeons, biomes, deserts (with pyramids!), jungle, the hell, and all the world objects. There are thousands (literally) crafting recipes, and it will take tens of hours to explore them. Single player is pretty good, and you will enjoy exploring the world, building castles (or dirt houses) and digging deeper into the ground. Multiplayer, however, is absolutely amazing - it really makes the game shine.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mstrchiefalexed/recommended/105600/","mstrchiefalexed","Stadarooni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mstrchiefalexed/","75 products in account","Boy, I remember buying this game when the 1.1 update came out. At that point I thought it was a well-done game, but when 1.2 was released, this game became one of my all time favourites.\n\nTo get things out of the way, this game is definitely inspired by Minecraft. It takes its elements such as mining, exploring, fighting monters at night, and crafting (along with others), but turns to dial to 11. The part of the game that feels the most "Minecraft-y" is when you start off in your world, but after that point the games true colours will start to show through. For clarification, I'm not here to compare this to Minecraft (which I still think is a great game), or even bash it. I'm here to tell you why you should buy Terraria, so let's get to that.\n\nFirst off, here's a few questions: Do you like sandbox games? Do you like games that have a retro 2D twist to them? Do you like playing with friends or by yourself? If your answers were yes, or in the the case of the last one either of the answers, then you might as well have just already bought the game. Not convinced? Ok then.\n\nIn Terraria, you start off in a forest, with measly copper tools. It's your job to build a shelter before night comes, to build better equipment, and to start mining. As I said earlier, this is where the game feels the most like a 2D Minecraft, but stick with me. Later on you'll gain NPC's which all provide unique services (such as a merchant, or a nurse), and realize how expansive the game really is.\n\nThought that forest you started in was too clich√©? Well, wait until you encounter the fiery depths of the Underworld, the blood-curling Crimson, the barran Desert's, or the monster infested Dungeon. These all have their own unique identity in terms of both looks, monsters, and geometry. Think zombies, slimes, and demon eyes are all pathetic losers? Well, wait until you fight an army of Goblin's, a horde of Demon's, and even a legion of blood-thirsty Snowmen. Hate your dinky copper equipment? Wait until you rock a full suit of Shroomite armour, weaponized with a sniper rifle and a rocket launcher. Where you end up in this game is amazing, the journey even more so. I could NEVER give the game justice when it comes to describing how much content and variety exists, so go take a look at the Terraria Wiki. Actually, experience it for yourself.\n\nIn terms of sound, each monster may have a growl or roar or whatever, but to be honest it's not something you'll really notice. The music though, it's quite amazing. Each envirnment has its own track, which creates an atmosphere you would expect out of a boss battle, a desert, or a snow forest. As for the graphics themself, the game has a very nice retro appeal to it, which is very charming and nice to look at.\n\nProgressing however is where the games structure, and even some of its faults start to show up. Progressing through the game involves you killing bosses, which are all unique challenges by the way. You evetually reach Hardmode, where your world transforms with more equipment to get, more monsters to kill, and more bosses and events to fight. However, once you kill a boss called Plantera the games main problem shows up: You need to grind. Now, to be fair their currently isn't a whole lot more progressing at this point, but getting the best equipment can take you a while. Actually, it could take you a shorter amount of time, or even a longer amount of time. That's another problem here: The RNG. There's only a certain chance some items will drop from slain monsters, which is also another issue with the game. Luckily, developer Re-logic is currently working on some more balencing changes, which should be helpful when the endgame update comes out.\n\nOh yes, the developer. Re-logic is amazing when it comes to making Terraria. They listen to their community and regularily keeps in touch with them, and all the post-laucnh content for the game is FREE. No DLC. No micro-transactions. All FREE content. And even though the main dev at Re-logic wont be working on the game anymore after the next update, the game will still be developed for however long it will be.\n\nSo, in short, Terraria is an excellent game. This review itself does NOT give the game enough justice for just how great it is. For $10, Terraria is a grab. Even the problems I listed above shouldn't minimze your enjoyment of the game, as you'll still have fun throughout your journey. Not every game needs a AAA budget, or a great story to be amazing. And that's Terraria. A 9.5/10 from me, in it's current state (v. 1.2.4.1). When 1.3 releases I'll be sure to edit this review as well.","October 25, 2014","true","89.3"," 43 of 49 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","43","49","0","18"

There are tons of different biomes and areas to explore, with unique mobs and loot in them.\n\nWeapons are for four different "classes" (warrior, ranger, mage and summoner.) Certain items give you bonuses for specific classes, so specializing yourself as one of them will give you a ton more of damage on the chosen weapon style.\n\nThere is also a wide variety of different accessories and items based on mobility to spice up the regular gameplay. (e.g. double jumps, grappling hooks and even wings.) The list keeps going and going.\n\nHowever there is no particular system for character progression in Terraria. (leveling, skillpoints etc.) But you will be gaining health crystals throughout exploring caves, which increase your maximum HP. Same goes for gathering Fallen stars for increasing maximum mana as mage.\n\nIn my own opinion, Terraria is one of the best games to play through with your friends. It is almost too addictive, and keeps me grinding for the rare drops no matter how lucky or unlucky I could be.\nIf you're not willing to buy it at full price, make sure to give it a try when it's on sale. (as you're still reading this.)\n\nPros:\nHuge variety of different weapons and items.\nRandomly generated world. (every world is different.)\nStill stuff being added.

In minecraft, it is all about being creative and building, whilst in terraria it's more about exploring, getting resources and upgrading equipment to fight epic bosses (to get more epic gear).\n\nTo give a clear comparison:\n- MC: Mostly building, a bit of exploration and surviving\n- Terraria: Exploring,  finding gear and fighting bosses, a bit of building\nOfcourse, it could still be possible that some people prefer to just explore and fight in minecraft instead of building. And some people might like building more in terraria than fighting. It's all personal... But enough of that. Let's talk about what this game has to offer.\n\nGAMEPLAY: the gameplay is very enjoyable. The game starts out a bit slowly, as you have NOTHING at all, except for a sword, an axe and a pickaxe. With those tools your adventure starts to find resources, to explore vast caves and to build a (relative) safe shelter/house/castle/whatever :p. There is a lot of progression to be found in this game and I find it very rewarding. Having finally found enough ores to upgrade your equipment, you can fight tougher bosses. You don't need to go through all the equipments though, if you just want good gear rightaway, good luck fighting your first boss without any armour and (with a bit of luck) a few bombs/shurikens ;). There are also accessoiries to be found in this game (like wings, hermes' boots - aka speed boots...) that really increase the fun! After your beat the WOF (wall of flesh), hardmode starts and difficulty increases. You'll find new bosses, new equipment, new ores etc. Be careful though - when hardmode is triggered, there is no way back!\n\nYOUR WORLD "LIVES": You may be aware of it or not, but when you enter your world, you automatically have to deal with the crimson/the corruption. On normal mode, this is easy controllable, but on hardmode, things can get wild. So better keep your shelter(s) safe from it, because otherwise your NPC's will despawn.\n\nNPC's: this game has a lot of NPC's that spawn under certain conditions. You'll need a shelter/house for them in order to enjoy all the goods they sell (seriously, some of them sell amazing things that you absolutely want to have!)\n\nMUSIC: this game has some good soundtracks. They change according to where you are (each biome has its own track), or whether it's day or night, you're fighting a boss etc. Even after all those hours I still did not get bored of these enjoyable soundtracks.\n\nGRAPHICS: some enjoy them, others don't. I personally think they fit the game really well.\n\nSo, again, I HIGHLY recommend this game. It offers great fun for countless hours. With friends it becomes even more enjoyable, but singleplayer is amazing too. The only negative point about this game is the "lack" of things to do. With this I don't mean there's not enough content, but you'll have to set your own goals. There's no questsystem whatsoever so you'll just have to explore the game yourself and see which hidden treasures you can find.\nIf I had to rate this game, I'd give it an 8.5/10\n\nPS. make use of the wiki sometimes, it can provide important information! :)","August 3, 2014","true","205.1"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","34","37","0","3"

I wasn't impressed of it before i started playing, because it is a 2D game and I'm not a fan of them (when i say im not a fan of them i mean i hate the graphis of these types of games), so you can conclude that this has to be a very special game to impress me so much and make me write a review about it. What I like a lot about this game is that it is so simple to learn, yet so challenging, especially when you have to beat bosses.\nStarting out At first you have to create your own character and island. You can customize your character, but the game gets to choose wheather you will have one of the following types of island - infected with corruption or with crimson.\nCrimson and Corruption  The crimson and corruption are types of bioms which everybody will have on their island. You can have only one of them. The two contain similar hazards, though each has its own unique enemies, items, and blocks. The tools, weapons, and armor obtained via Corruption materials are slightly less powerful than those obtained via Crimson materials, and Corruption enemies are also slightly less powerful.The corruption is purple colloured and the crimson is red colloured. This infection spreads with the time you spend playing on your island. Although some players don't mind it and even let it grow, I personally would advise all new players to make sure that this infection doesn't spread on your island. It infects trees, blocks, even the creatures are different and the music is kinda creepy and really annoying. So at the very beggining of your game find the infected part of your island and try to dig around it - maybe - 4,5 blocks around every infected part. One more thing this infection can spread even underground, so is very important to dig fastly, so you don't have more work later. In the end you will have something like an underground tunell. You can put lights so that it is easier to dig. If you feel lazy to dig, keep in mind that while you dig underground, you can stumble on to different furnitures (yes there are a lot of furnitures, decorated small rooms undrerground which you can take and decorate your house with it). So that can motivate you to dig more. When your tunell is ready, you island is now safe and can't get get infected anymore.\nNPC An NPC is an non-player character. This is a friendly automated character that provides different services to players. You just need to stand close to them and you will be able to buy the items they provide. They will generally walk around during the day, they can talk to each other, or to the player. Why it is good to have more NPC in your house?\nThe more rooms your house has, the more NPC will move in and the wider choice of bying items you will have. Also town NPCs that have moved into Houses reduce enemy spawn rates in the area, an effect that increases when more of them move in your house.\nEquipable items  While digging underground you can find weapons too. Keep in mind that you can equip those weapons and make your character stronger. Also when you beat a boss, you earn even more powerfull weapons. You can equip wings, so that you move faster, different kinds of items which boost your atack speed, health regeneration and e.t.c.\nCharacter and world modes There are 3 types of character modes - softcore, mediumcore and hardcore mode. And there are 2 types of world modes - normal and expert mode.\nBosses Defeating bosses makes you advance in the game in some way. Each boss has its own particular way of being summoned, and warning messages appear whenever one is about to appear. There are pre - hard mode bosses, hadmode bosses and event bosses. When defeating a boss, he can drop and item or a weapon (or nothing xD). Stronger bosses drop stronger weapons.\nHealth Health is the character's life count, they look like heart icons and you can find them at the top-right of your screen. Each red heart is equal to 20 health. Taking a lot of damage causes health to drop. Your health will regenerate when you stop taking damage. Regeneration can also be boosted using various equippable items. Also when you dig undreground, you can find  Life Fruit to increase your health. With 15 Life Crystals and 20 Life Fruits used, a character can reach 20 yellow hearts, which equals 500 maximum health.\nMultiplayer  The most enjoyable part of this game. If you want to progress faster, you will deffinetelly need friends to play with. The more people, the easier to beat bosses and creatures, find materials and build different kinds of buildings or just explore your island.\nSummary In conculstion, you can continue playing this game hours and hours before you are able to stop. There is a countless number of materials which you use to make  weapons, armor and a whole bunch of cool stuff you can find exploring your island. You can construct different buildings using the materials you have found and decorate them, you just have to have a big imagination. I absolutelly love the co - op part and it is really fun when you play with someone else. There are bosses which you have to take down and they become harder to kill with higher difficulties, so it is essential to have a buddy to help you out. There is just simply so much to learn about this game that it can never make you bored. Overall 11/10 one of my best choices so far ^^\n\nWarning:\n\nIt is also very important that you  back up your files. It is done when you open the game, before entering your island. You will see a little cloud icon under your character. That is steam cloud and I strongly advise everybody to move their character and world to it.\n\nOverall this is one of the best games I have played so far and there are not many games which are near to give you that joy of playing them.","July 24, 2015","true","320.3"," 41 of 49 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","41","49","3","3"

In reality, it's so much more than that. Terraria provides a large world the explore, tons of monsters to defeat, NPC's to befriend, loot to gather, a constant stream of upgrades, loot, and progress.\n\nThere is always something to do in this game, and it'll most likely benifit your progress in some way or another.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing, the graphics are very charming and gives the game a "SNES" style to it.\n\nIf you bring some friends along for the ride, it's even better! The boss fights are amazing, and well designed. Teamwork will play a huge key if you're playing with your mates.\n\nDoesn't matter if you're going solo or have assembled a band of merry heroes, Terraria will have something in store for you from the Eye of Cthulhu to the Moon Lord (Even after that).\n\nAnd that is why I give this game a solid 9/10.","April 29","true","97.3"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","33","36","9","0"

Over my playtime of this (245.3HRS) currently, I had quite some fun on this game.\n\nTo start off; NPCS can be floating around, you can bassicly explore anywhere, even acquire some of the most CRAZY items that i cant even explain.

Yeah, even if they are eye balls with no limbs or anything...They will tear you limb from limb.\n\nSo you decide to dig down into the dark abyss of the ground for minerals that you can craft into weapons and armor to fight monsters that tear you limb from limb and then you discover there are even more powerful monsters that you must destroy to help clear the land so you can enjoy peace and quiet. So you collect loot and build your tiny prick-free home into usually a giant prick-free home filled with all kinds of gear you collected or crafted and are prepared for any monsters or demons. Then it turns out, there is a Giant Flesh monster thing in the very bottom pit of the world that you must destroy.

If you do buy Terraria then after finishing it check out "The story of Red Cloud" mod/story/map because it's amazing as well - it's a community collaboration mod and it's incredible how much work and effort they put in, link is at the bottom.\n\nSummary:\nSo at the bare bones of it all, I'll compare it to Minecraft (Vanilla - no mods) and to sum it all up; Terraria is SO much better than Minecraft by a long shot and even when considering mods "The Story of Red Cloud" is an exceptional mod too. Basically, Terraria is a Dig, Mine, Craft and Combat game. You'll be spending a lot of your time spelunking, and fighting monsters. There's quite a few bosses in the game and lot of things to aim for. The average playthrough I do now is about 35 hours (with 3-4 total players) so if/when you buy this be willing to put quite a few hours into the game as there is a LOT to do.\n\nGameplay - Combat:\nThe combat is pretty straight forward and basic, the range weapons (Bows and Guns) shoot very similar, you point where you want to shoot and it shoots there, simple as. When it comes to choices you don't really have a choice between weapons until later on, at the start it's basically a bow that you replace when you come across better versions but after reaching a high stage in the game you'll end up getting decisions about which paths you want. Arrows/Bullets are really where you'll have more choice between your attacks and so on. You'll see what I mean when you get it. WHEN you get it!\nMagic is slightly different but essentially the same, most of them shoot and instead of arrows you consume mana, most magic weapons a lot of fun and it gets a lot better when you reach the later stages. At the start you can pretty much chuck the idea of magic out the window as you'll barely find any spells for the first part.\nMelee though, is kind of lame, you swing a sword and most swords are exactly the same but just deal more damage, some swords hit hard but swing slow, others hit low but swing fast. You don't really have much choice here and generally  you forced to Melee for the starting period anyway, still fun though.\nArmour in the game is slightly more in-depth, having all 3 pieces (Helmet, Chest-plate, Leggings) and it gives you a passive, most of the early game armours give you more defense but end game armours give you more unique attributes. It's fun to mess around to see what the best one is for you and your kind of playstyle is, but overall you do get quite a bit of choice when it comes to armour, more than Minecraft EVER as (even with mods).\n\nGameplay - Items:\nThen there's accessories, they give you a special trait when equipped, Hermes boots allows you to run really fast if nothing is in your way, Philosophers Stone allows you to drink healing potions faster, Rocket boots allow you to fly, a lot of these are different but you will see alternatives for certain play styles, for example, there are damage accessories that respect each type of attack, Magic, Ranged and Melee, you get a LOT of choice when it comes to these. It's best if I leave to your imagination.\nOverall, items in this game are very very abundant and you'll have a harder time choosing between which ones you want to use than actually getting the items in the first place.\nSome items that you may want can have a very small chance of dropping, as a result you can find yourself farming creatures for a long time in order the get the item but it's a double-edged blade, as they are percentage drops you can find it straight off the bat, equally you can spend hours trying to find it. It's a pain but it is rewarding in the end.\nAlso, certain items can only be found in certain areas which adds to exploring.\n\nGameplay - building:\nLike Minecraft, you can build, but unlike Minecraft you won't be spending too much of your time building, nor will you really care on the appearance of your house all that much either. The only real building you'll be doing is making an arena to fight bosses, and making little flats for the NPCs to live in.\nIt's set up into 2 layers, the primary layer - the one that affects the player and gets in the way of the player, acting as walls, ceilings and floors this is the one you directly interact with. Then the background layer which is basically the game wall, you rarely interact with it and you only really build to make things look nice (or so it acts as a house so NPCs can move in - did I mention you have NPCs that you need to build rooms for?)\nSaying that though, there are a lot of items to make your house look nice, a ton if different block choices to pick from. Even though the building in this game is basic, I've seen some pretty amazing builds from people, so don't let that put you off - especially if you like pixel art.\n\nGameplay - exploring:\nThere's a lot to explore in this game and it's randomly generated too, all over the world you'll find chests to loot with nice goodies in including money and items that you can use, it's very fun to follow a cave structure down into the depths of world whilst lighting the entire path up with torches. There's a lot of little secret areas you'll come across and there a lot of different biomes in the game each with varying difficulty (bloody Jungle biome is a pain). When you reach Hard Mode you'll come across even more biomes.\nThis game has a lot to explore, and a lot to find as well, most of the time you won't be coming across the same items in the chest and they almost always contain something you want (unless you've finished the game already).\nAlso, certain items can only be found in certain areas which adds to exploring.\n\n\nGraphics and sound:\nThese are very basic elements of the game, it's a pixel game, but the graphics complete the gameplay with their simplistic but comforting style. Unlike Minecraft, you won't want to download a texture pack for this game. Sound is also pretty basic too, it doesn't really do much and the music of the game is a lot better. Chances are though you'll be playing with others and talking over the sound anyway. That or listening to your own music.\n\n\nRe-playability:\nIt really depends on how much you like this game, but as you can see I've got ~350 hours in the game and I still really enjoy it, I often find myself coming back to it time and time again and play it through with my mates from start to finish just for the sake of it, it's a great multiplayer game I should mention. I also find myself playing it through again when one of my friends say "I haven't played it before" and I'm just like "Well what are you waiting for!?".\nIt's just a great game and I can't wait for Terraria 2 when it comes out in the year 2052.\n\n\nYes, I would DEFINITELY recommend this game.\n- Vince\n\nLink to "The story of Red Cloud" mod/story/map:\nhttp://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/map-feature-the-story-of-red-cloud.87904/\n\n\nLink to my YouTube Channel.\nLink to my Twitter Page.\n{LINK REMOVED} Link to my Blog.\nLink to my Curations.","December 28, 2014","true","576.0"," 44 of 55 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","44","55","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PURESEXCELLENCY/recommended/105600/","PURESEXCELLENCY","Squire Grooktook","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PURESEXCELLENCY/","360 products in account","Terraria is a pretty interesting hybrid between a metroidvania style adventure and a Minecraft style sandbox/building game.\n\nOnce you start the game, you're immediately dumped into a huge randomly generated world with no idea what to do or how to do it. You really have to explore and figure out how things work on your own, which gives it a really oldschool and immersive feeling at the cost of being a bit time consuming and difficult (unless you look things up in a strategy guide, as many older players had to for certain rpgs, ha ha).\n\nProgressing through the game requires the player to explore all the various aspects of the game. From building a base, managing items, and fighting enemies, you'll have to do a little of each to reach each of the games bosses, which will award you with the tools to further explore the hidden reaches of the game world such as the fiery underworld or hidden fairy tale land. Each of these elements is fairly well executed, with combat and platforming being an eon above Minecraft and its ilk even if it's still somewhat clunky by most 2d standards. The rpg, building, and sandbox elements are also well done, allowing you a lot of options in building and a host of ways to customize your character and world in the long run.\n\nThe game also has co op and PVP. With the huge assortment of weapons and bases to build, there's definitely some interesting potential for pvp tomfoolery. Having multiple friends all building, exploring, and cooperating in such a massive world can also be immense fun.\n\nTerraria is very much do-it-yourself type of game. Whether you want to completely teraform your world, build it for multiplayer, or simply make it to the end and defeat the final boss, you'll have to be pretty self motivated in your goals since nothing is really pushing you forward to do any one of these. As a Metroidvania/Sandbox hybrid rpg, it makes for an interesting breed of old school roleplaying. Some players seeking excitement and progress may ultimately grow bored once they've seen all there is to see, but working your way up to that point is definitely an interesting, if time consuming journey.","June 21, 2014","true","79.3"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","27","29","0","0"

Its pretty hard to get into when your new. Having a friend showing you the basics helps. But you will spend alot of time looking at wikis to figure out what to do. Some people may like it since you get to explore. However you will probably miss huge chunks of the games content.\n\nIt also has alot of useful items only obtainable threw RNG. *cough* cellphone *cough*\n\nOne slighly more minor thing is that somtimes. Your world or charecters may get corrupted. This usually never happens but if it does there is no way to recover them. However this rarely happens. I have only gotten a charecter lost once without mods.\n\nOne thing if you do get the game. DONT GET ITEMS FROM OTHER PEOPLE. It does severly ruin the game. If you play multiplayer, make sure you either play with another new player. Or somone who is willing to start over. This game is about the journey not the destination.\n\nPeople who do say this game gets boring fast have gotten items from other people.","March 5","false","055.3"," 373 of 609 people (61%) found this review helpful 64 people found this review funny","61","373","609","64","89"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mryyelo/recommended/105600/","mryyelo","MrYyelo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mryyelo/","241 products in account","This is a story about how Terraria got me into Steam.\n\n"You should get steam." said my friend to me a long time ago, "Get this game called Terraria, it's like Minecraft but with working multiplayer.". Being a younger me, and following the crowd of minecraft fanatics who were no good at it and had to look up tutorials just to figure out how the hell redstone works, I really liked the sound of this "Terraria" thing. At first I was reluctant to use Steam. But once I got into Terraria, many games followed in its footsteps and ended up in my gaming library. To this day, Terraria holds a special place in my heart. Reserving a seat for a possible sequel that is hopefully the gift that I want it to be.\n\nThat's a nice story, but it doesn't say anything about the game. Let me get to that right now. This is a game that is quite a lot like Minecraft. Only slightly better. "Better?" I hear some of you say, "But it is an ugly 2d piece of poopy that could not compare to the perfection that is Minecraft!". Aha, but that is where you are wrong, because what it lacks in third dimensions, it makes up for in so many ways. There are more features in this game for you to poke your sword at than Minecraft can propose.\n\nMinecraft hands you nothing but your fists and a world to explore. This is a wonderful feeling, building up your home, expanding, killing your first monster, and cooking some meat to keep yourself alive. But the problem with that game, is that once you have the best gear, that's it. You win. You defeat the boss, and it's done. You basically have no reason to play anymore. While with Terraria, once you get the best gear, go beat the boss, you think you beat it. But then you realise that you have unleashed a whole new hell on your self and your awesome armor is now mere paper compared to the new enemies that you will face. Time to upgrade your gear, and reinforce your home, you're in for a bumpy ride. This happens about 3 times. Bring friends along to make it even more fun.\n\nThe only thing that Terraria fails in is the Survival aspect. If you enjoy having to worry about your food, water, and fatigue, then you may be disappointed. Death is not a worry, all you lose is some money. The loss of which is easily prevented via use of a convenient piggy bank. Food in this game gives buffs to make you fight better, but it isn't necessary to your survival. The only liquids you will drink are ones that will heal you or give you more mystical energy, and sleeping is a foreign concept to the people of Terraria, beds only serve their purpose as a resurrection point for the common folk. This game is a fun game to play by your self, or with friends. However harder on your own. But more rewarding. Another bad thing is that this game has a lot of good loot that you may just have to have for yourself, which will require you to farm certain enemies many times to get them to drop one.\n\nI do recommend that you get this game and give it a good run. It's only 10 USD, but it gives so much more than your 10 dollars worth.","June 8, 2014","true","023.6"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","25","26","0","5"

Terraria seems to do a lot of the stuff Minecraft does but better. Combat is way more fun and there are at least 50 weapons in the game. from Shark-powered guns to spear and TNT sticks. There is Magic with all kinds of spells. you can get special ammo for you guns, like one that tracks your target. and there are ROCKET launcher! need i say more? Combat in Terraria is fast and fluid (and a little bit gory). Players can fight PVP or PVE.  and one of the best parts in Terraria, Bosses. These large hostiles range from rather easily to insanely hard, making Co-op and almost must to finish the biggest Boss. and even when you defeat the most powerful enemy in your wold, The Wall of flesh, you aren't done. on the Walls death your world is overcome with even more powerful enemy and several new tougher bosses. needless to say this will keep you busy for a while.\n\n\n\nNow, Exploring in Terraria is better to me than Minecraft. i can't really explain but Terraria's underworld and caves feel more random and different than Mincraft Caves. also with some many different biomes there really is a lot to discover, like a mushroom biome or a jungle or a giant bee hive. Terraria has a simple feature that makes exploring easier and more fun, and that is real-time torches/lighting. by this i mean that you can just hold out a torch without placing it and it will light the way. (it makes me feel like Indiana Jones). later in the game you can get a miners helmet that lets you use your weapons/gear without having to place lighting. the liquid in Terraria is more life-like, because liquids don't spawn an infinite source they can and will drain away if you make a hole or pump it all out.\n\n\nTerraria has a lot of neat little features like gear, you can get wings,jetpacks,measure tools, and more. one of my favorite items is the ivory whip. this allows you to cling to walls making it a lot easier to climb and build. another fun thing in Terraria are the NPCs. these guys/gals will move into Empty homes that meet the requirements, and then sell you items like weapons,ammo,gear,blocks,wires(more on that later), and even Party items.\n\nanother epic feature in Terraria is the wire system. it is what it sounds like. a red-stone like system that allows you to control pumps,lighting,traps, and doors. The Wire system in Terraria has some better features that Minecraft. you can put the wires anywhere and they are not visible unless you are holding a wrench.\n\nAnd even with all these features and with a second gaming be made the Devs still update and fix bugs in Terraria. Terraria is well worth your $15.","March 24, 2014","true","40.8"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","26","28","0","0"

It is not Minecraft 2D!\n\nTerraria is a sandbox, crafting based, metroidvania, rpg, surviving, exploration game. You actually have to do something, a sort of "campaign".\n\nIt's not only about surviving, because there isn't a hunger system, you could just build a small house and stay there forever.\nYou want to be the best, you want to rule the world, you want to thrive.\nThis is all about crafting and gather resources.

Terraria is a classic veteran of my library that was originally given to me as a gift. Being the tasteless, unrefined scrublord that I was back in the day, I didn't understand the controls and the fact that "E" was not universally the use button. I then dismissed it and left it alone for 3 months before picking it up again. It was the best decision I had ever processed through my hormone-riddled child mind. Terraria is a beautifully crafted game that only aged well (so far, but in a game like this it's hard to mess up), like cheese to wine.\n\nPROS:\n+ Mother of Jesus I can have all this content and you're telling me I DON'T have to purchase DLC for it? You're telling me there is NO in-game purchases for self-entitled whiny brats? Oh Re-Logic, you lovable scamps you. Seriously marry me I have the ring in my back pocket and my front pockets and my trachea\n\n+ Better than Minecraft in many different regards, and you don't even NEED to mod this game or be in 3D to experience it! Sure, lack of depth. Lack of environtment or whatever. Hope the sheer amount of gear and lack of the "we sold this game to Microsoft" smell compared to unmodded Minecraft doesn't mean jack to you.\n\n+ Virtually no bugs! Unless you go about searching them to report 'em and be a buzzkill/sincerely good person, playing the game normally shouldn't really cause any problems. Hey Skyrim, look at THIS game and tell me that it needs Unofficial Patches, eh?\n\n+ Customization is just oh. Gimme some'a dat. More costume items then you have chests for. Dyes in all colors of the rainbow (including rainbow). A recently-added feature that allows your trinkets to be shown visually on the player. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY ANY OF IT.  Stop complaining TF2, Spiral Knights and Fashionogi, you got burned so hard dry ice is backing away in fear.\n\nCONS:\n- The griefing can be a real pain. This all depends on the moderation and quality of the server, however. Walking into a server, you can expect to see either a beautiful metropolis with almost all the real estate taken up, or a barren wasteland devoid of all asthetic wonders besides for dirt walls floating in the sky and some torches. Maybe a table.\n\n- Adding on to the whole griefing con, TNT and explosives in general. These simple blocks (and two ammo types) and throwable projectiles can WRECK near anything in the environment, which includes your house. Fortunately for you, most good servers come with some form of protection so that your house isn't raided and destroyed after 3 hours away. Or you could, y'know, share a house with someone else.\n\n\nIn conclusion, Terraria is good. No, I'm serious. You read any of my reviews? This is normally a paragraph in itself. But whatever, TERRARIA IS GOOD. IT JUST IS OK TRUST ME I KNOW WHAT I'M KNOWING JESUS CHRI","October 5, 2014","true","508.2"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","31","38","0","9"

The game is about getting better equipment, fighting monsters and beating bosses. This is nothing like Minecraft don't be mistaken, just in 2D building bases and other constructions looses its meaning. Terraria remind me of 2D World of Warcraft much more than Minecraft. There is a big potential in crafting system, but it is very confusing for new players, too many types of material and a huge scale of items that you don't even know what to do first, but luckily you don't need most of it - just give it enough time and you might more than like it.\n\n6.5 /10","October 8, 2015","true","11.3"," 36 of 47 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","36","47","4","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ApolloMB2/recommended/105600/","ApolloMB2","Hestia(Apollo)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ApolloMB2/","316 products in account","Terraria is a 2D sandbox action/adventure game. When you first open the game, you will have to create a character and a world. This is a feature I really liked, because not every world has all possible items and it adds to the overall replayability. Some worlds may have a crimson biome instead of a corruption or actually have a pyramid or two. Gameplay-wise the game is really good. You have so much weapons, armor and accesories to chose from and 4 different play styles: melee, ranged, magic and summoner. The fighting in general is just awesome, especially when tackling bosses, which are alot. Mining and building is also a big part of the game and you have pretty much the basic equipment: picks for any type of block or background object, axes for cutting trees and hammers for destroying background walls and changing the shape of blocks into slopes and half-blocks.The crafting is simple, just open your inventory and on the bottom left you will see a scroll-down list of things you can craft. You can expand the list by standing near crafting stations like workbenches, furnaces or anvils. it is quite simple and there is an NPC that shows you everything that can be crafted from a material. Speaking of NPC's, there are about 20 of them in the game. You have to build houses and do certain tasks for them to spawn. They allow you to do plenty of things like sell unneeded items, buy items or reforge weapons for better stats. Building a house is pretty much required if you want to get some good items. There are so many block types in the game that you can pretty much make alot of different buildings that don't look the same and are unique. Once a house meets the requirements for an NPC to move in, you can then wait a while and they will appear. The graphics are just beautiful and have that Super Nintendo style. The music is also exactly good and there is alot of variety for it. Not many biomes share music and the overworld and cavern biomes have an alternative track.\nOverall, I'd reccomend this game to everyone. It has alot to do, has free updates that add more content that you could imagine and is well optimized, so even older computers can handle it. I give it a 10/10. There are a few bugs, but most of the game-braking ones from a recent patch are fixed within a day or so.\n","June 15, 2014","true","554.7"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","0"

The weaponry and magic items are created with incredible imagination and a bit of twisted, demonic humour ( my favorite sword being named " The demonic blood butcherer") I even came across an enemy by the name of tim, a dark caster in a cavern. After a bit of research i confirmed my suspicions to tim being a reference to "Tim the enchanter" from Monty python and the holy grail.

Chances are you‚Äôre already familiar with the game and you already have deep-seated opinions about it. Even so, I‚Äôm going to write out this review to provide some closure and articulation to my own thoughts.\n\nBefore trying it, I assumed Terraria was 2D Minecraft. I was wrong. Although many game elements are clearly inspired by Minecraft, and comparisons between the two games are inevitable, they are very different games. Terraria is less of a sandbox game, and more of an action-RPG with destructible terrain. The focus is placed on questing, combat, and underground exploration. In Minecraft, you can have the ultimate equipment after a sufficiently lucky 30-minute cave exploration, but in Terraria it can take 40 hours or more to conquer all the quests and the bosses.\n\nMinecraft is largely a survival and engineering game ‚Äì success comes through careful planning and calculated risks. Unlike Minecraft, Terraria‚Äôs building aspect is severely downplayed. There‚Äôs no survival element at all since you‚Äôre given unlimited, (almost) consequence-free respawns.\n\nTerraria is tricky to criticize; all of its greatest strengths are simultaneously also its deepest, most irreparable flaws. These are elements you can‚Äôt remove from the game ‚Äì removing them would destroy what makes it uniquely Terraria ‚Äì but they cause so many problems in the grander scope that they hinder and ultimately destroy its longevity.\n\nFirst issue: items are tied to the character rather than the world. If you load up your character‚Äôs inventory with loot, you can simply hop into another server and it all goes with you. On the surface, this is a fantastic idea that allows you to grow attached to a character and continue their adventure across multiple servers. The big problem comes with multiplayer. This system absolutely does not work with mismatched character levels. At all. Power creep is massive in this game, and so is ‚Äúbored god syndrome." A maxed character can plough through all the game‚Äôs events in about a half hour, whereas it takes a good 20-40 hours to do everything from scratch. Underleveled characters won‚Äôt be able to keep up. Powerful characters don't like waiting around for them.\n\nThis is especially problematic playing with newbies who don't know the game‚Äôs basic progression. If a newbie is on a server with high-level characters, they won't learn how to summon the Eye of Cthulhu, or what demon altars do, or what the Pwnhammer is, and so much more. They‚Äôll be given some spare items without getting to learn where they came from and how they were made. Worst of all, the weak characters will know that they aren‚Äôt contributing anything to the server since they can‚Äôt do anything that the overleveled characters can‚Äôt do with fifty times more efficiency. And since there's no server option to force a blank character, there is no way to prevent this from happening. Having been on both sides of this coin, I can honestly say that it‚Äôs depressing to see or to be a weak character playing on a server with strong characters.\n\nAnother issue is that the game has far, far too many items. Compared to Minecraft‚Äôs 5 sword tiers, There are over 75 different swords alone in the game. Multiply that by the types of bows, pickaxes, armors‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs not even counting the block types, potions, fish, accessories, plants‚Ä¶ We're talking over 3,500 different types of items.\n\nIt‚Äôs great because it adds a deeper sense of diversity to the game. Unlike Minecraft, you can actually choose a pseudo-class in Terraria, specializing in any kind of combat. You can then collect and manage the items that are beneficial to that class. It‚Äôs satisfying being something other than a standard diamond-armored archer like in Minecraft. And it keeps exploration fun: the game can always surprise you with rare drops and new discoveries at every turn.\n\nBut at the same time, the staggering number of items in Terraria just goes to show how smart Minecraft was for limiting them. Storage and categorization of items is an utter nightmare. Now, Terraria includes many conveniences to help you manage your items, including auto-sorting your inventory into nearby chests, ability to use color-coded and named chests, the complete bypassing of the crafting grid by simply listing all the crafting recipes for you, and even a garbage can built into the inventory screen itself. Yet, even with all these great inventory tweaks, it still isn‚Äôt nearly enough to keep the sheer number of items from overwhelming you, stuffing your inventory full. Item sorting is so time-consuming that I always gave up on keeping an organized storage room, and just started dumping my items in the nearest open space. The times when I decided to tackle the organization, I‚Äôd give up after an hour and not even be halfway done. It‚Äôs probably the most unfun part of the game.\n\nFurthermore, many of these items are useless because game progression happens a bit too fast. You‚Äôll make a full set of Iron armor, then get Demonite ten minutes later, Meteorite thirty minutes after that, and so on‚Ä¶ repeated for about 20 tiers of items. You‚Äôll constantly be throwing away tools you may have only used for a few minutes before making something better. If you want to fully appreciate any one tier, you‚Äôve got to intentionally slow down your play and pace yourself. It‚Äôs awesome that the game is self-paced‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôve got the patience for it.\n\nAnd finally: the longevity problem. You know how some RPGs hide the best sword in the final dungeon where it‚Äôs useless because there‚Äôs nothing left to use it on? That‚Äôs Terraria‚Äôs endgame in a nutshell. It‚Äôs so bad that there‚Äôs been two huge updates which have basically doubled the length of the game progression, one adding a ‚Äúhard mode‚Äù that adds several more quests, and another adding an ‚Äúexpert mode‚Äù that serves as a ‚Äúnew game plus‚Äù for your overleveled character to conquer. But it still just prolongs the inevitable for a few dozen hours. Worlds are fixed size and are not infinite, and there‚Äôs no sense of risk and reward because deaths mean nothing and you can always use your trusty Magic Mirror to panic out of a bad situation. The core of the gameplay is the long, progressive struggle for power; once you have the power, there‚Äôs no gameplay left unless you want to start all over again. Unlike a Minecraft server which is infinitely large and immersive, a Terraria server will ‚Äúend‚Äù and ultimately be used up completely, unable to offer anything new. Clinging to your character and taking your loot to a new server will just make the same thing happen, but faster. The only way to keep the game alive is to let go and start over ‚Äì but after all the work it took to become a god, will you really want to do that?\n\nDespite any complaints, I loved the game. Those 100+ hours were incredible while they lasted. I laughed, I cried, I raged, I geeked out over stats, I soared through the sky on beetle wings. I discovered mystery and celebrated victory alongside my friends, and I made some memories I might never forget. The questionable design choices I complained about were deliberate risks which made the game into exactly what it is. They may have caused game balance to ultimately crash into a wall due to the ridiculous power creep involved, but the ride itself was completely worth it.\n\nI‚Äôll give Terraria a 7 / 10. It may not last forever like some other sandbox games, but there‚Äôs too much here to discover and enjoy. If you haven‚Äôt played this game the way it is best played ‚Äì with everyone starting from scratch at once, without overpowered friends doing everything for you ‚Äì you‚Äôre missing out. Terraria is about the journey, not the destination.","April 1","true","139.9"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","23","26","3","5"

Every biome is colorful, looks different and overall looks very nice. And before you say it's pixelated i am not talking about resolution, i am talking about how it looks and is pleasing to the eye.\n\nGameplay is more in a straight line. In Minecraft, you do what you want, but you follow a set path, iron, diamonds, nether.... In Terraria this is expanded even more, because of bosses, hard mode, and new ores.\n\nControls are very good. This is a game that was meant to be played on PC, and it feels like it, which means playing with a controler is not recommended. Anyways, everything feels smooth, and the control will work in more peacefull situations, like building a house, and in boss fights and other times where fighting is a must.\n\nAnother amazing thing about Terraria are the classes. If you play alone, you can use what you want, but you can adapt to one of the classes - melee, gunner or mage. This comes very helpfull in multiplayer, when in other games everyone wants the best weapons, here everyone plays with only weapons and armor of his class.\n\nThere are also some bad things in Terraria. One thing is you can't have an infinite world. Don't get me wrong, if you select large world it is pretty large, but even then you can run out off chests, or you may not get that pyramid in your world which isn't very good. Luckily you can play with your character on other worlds, but you have to leave all of your structures from the other world.\n\nAnother thing that can be stressfull is mining for ores, especially the end-game ores. To craft armor, you need around 50 ingots, and for every ingot you need 3-7 ores. This can take a long time, especially if you're playing multiplayer and everyone wants armor, but someone has to do other things than mining.\n\nThe last bad thing is that items you can buy are very expensive, so you must make a gold farm, or sell all of your freshly mined ores to buy them.\n\nOverall, Terraria is a fantastic game and if you have time to play it, there shouldn't be many problems. And if you become bored of the random worlds, different biomes and play styles, there is also a ton of mods, or custom maps to try.","July 15, 2014","true","312.9"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","3"

It does it's thing very well. I haven't noticed any UI bugs, or ones that I have, are fixed almost instantly after the patch is released. The gameplay it provides is not only smooth, it is addicting and fun. The combat system in the game is perfect for me, and a lot of others. There are so many enemy types in this game that are not copy paste, each one does their own thing and has their own weaknesses & strength's\n\nExample on the kind of enemies you could come across.\nNormal walking/running enemies, that have a soul objective to charge you until death. These may include enemies like the zombie or skeleton.\nAs there are other enemies who will do the same thing, but in a different way (So not everything is copy/paste.). Like the slime enemy type, which come in many varieties, which will bounce towards you. Or the spider enemy type, which will walk on the ground, but can also climb on the walls to get to you quicker. Just to name a few.\n\nIn the world of Terraria, there are alternate versions of almost everything. What I mean by this is, each world you have will not be the same. For example, there is a 50/50 chance when loading a world to have the default version of something, or the alternate. Such as the music that plays, there are different tracks for the same biomes, just depends on what random one you got. Or for textures on things like, grass, and trees. Also things like ore, in a default world you would have Copper as your basic ore, but in an alternate world, you'd have Tin as your basic ore. What this does is really expands the play time someone can spend in Terraria. Allowing a single person to play the game over and over, and never have the same experience.\n\nBelow the surface are loads of blocks, dirts, ores, and more. Ore like Copper, Tin, Lead, Iron, Silver, Platinum, Gold, Cobalt, etc. And blocks like normal dirt, clay, stone, mud, cobwebs, and so many more. You need these ores to make your weapons and armor. You can find treasure deep underground, that holds many valuable things. You can increase your maximum health by finding Life Crystals underground.\n\nThe weapon range in this game is massive. You even have magic weapons, like spell books, and mana weapons. There are also bows, swords, pickaxes, axes, guns, lazers, cannons, familiars, and so much more.\n\nPROS\n+Loads of content for hours of game time.\n+Great combat system.\n+Smooth gameplay, that's easy to slip into.\n+Provides a good challenge.\n+Fun and creative boss battles.\n+Amazing side events that you cannot resist.\n\nCONS\n-No infinite world option.\n-Still no easy way to download mods/texture packs.\n\nOverall rating: Is about a 14.5/15 (Must Own!)","January 25, 2015","true","224.2"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","19","20","0","3"

I say that because it has the building aspects of Minecraft, the platforming aspects of a slightly-out-of-the-ordinary platformer, and RPG styling (there's a set of armor that effectively makes you either a white mage or a black mage, for one.) But really, where Terraria really shines is how quickly it can be updated. The gap between updates in Terraria is about 2 months. Compare that to Minecraft's 4-6 month average (Minecraft 1.8 has been in development for what, 9 months now?) Because Terraria has a stronger foundation (Java is not Minecraft's cup of tea--no pun intended--but it's a necessary evil for them,) it got an upper hand.\n\nAs one reviewer put it, Terraria is Minecraft's first real competitor. Because it can update faster and give players new options more quickly, it gets the advantage. The real disadvantage is that the lack of the z-axis kills some of the creativity. I myself can ignore that however, as I suck at Minecraft art. So really, if you want to see what Minecraft would be like with 15 boatloads of more features, then Terraria is for you.","May 10, 2014","true","880.4"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","2"

Before you say it, this is NOT another Minecraft clone. There are 100s even 1000s of differences between the two games. If you're down for more than just building then Terraria is the game for you. Not only is it a sandbox mode game but it's filled with adventure. You start off by building your world and then you're slapped into this beautiful 2D world filled with flowers, trees, bunnies and more. You need to not only build a house to survive in but you need to build a house for NPCs to come to your world so that you can buy guns, bombs, get heals, etc. As you get more and more geared up you keep taking on more and more bosses. With the addition of the 1.3 patch a lot more content got added to Terraria so there's more to explore and more bosses to kill. You can even up the difficulty if you're up for a real challenge. If you love to be creative and have an amazing time adventureing then Terraria is the game for you. Terraria is a must have for ANY Steam user so why not buy the game for not only yourself but your friends. You won't regret it. You'll spend countless hours farming, building and adventuring all while you're in the good company of your friends\n\n- Insane amount of content\n- Great combat\n- Challenging bosses\n- Beautiful Soundtrack\n- Huge updates\n- Amazing art\n- Events (Pirates, Solar Eclipses, Slime Rain, etc)\n\nFinal Verdict;\n\n10/10","August 21, 2015","true","27.9"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","20","22","3","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scientistB/recommended/105600/","scientistB","Sciwako","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scientistB/","67 products in account","Oh gosh.\nTerraria. Ter-freaking-raria.\nWhere do I begin?\n\nWell first off, I wish to write this because I LOVE this game. I also want to write this because I come across a lot of people that are like "u r dum, minceraft iz bettr." I even had a friend who, whenever I said the word Terraria, would correct me by saying "You mean, 2D Minecraft." Those are the people who probably haven't gotten past the spawning point. Yes, the basics of Terraria are rather comparable to Minecraft; you break trees, make a crafting station, build or dig a house, and go mining. Simple, right?\nThat is, until you reach further into the game.\n\nThis game gives you a reason to explore each biome. There's a massive variety of enemies, most of which drop specific items needed to make specific things. On that note, Terraria has over a hundred different enemies, while Minecraft only has a small handful. Most of Minecraft's mobs don't quite belong in a number of biomes either. I can understand spiders in jungles and forests, but not skeletons. Those belong in the desert (or underground where Terraria's skeletons spawn). When creating a home in Minecraft, the only thing that influences your opinion is your favorite biome. I tend to make homes in deserts because it's a lot easier to see and traverse. However, in Terraria it's a lot more than that. Each biome has its own unique music, as well as their own set of hazards. Here, I make my home in the basic forest biome because it has the easiest set of enemies. And, the trees are in the background and don't obnoxiously block your way or obscure your vision like Minecraft does. (If possible, in Minecraft I'd prefer to live on a mushroom island, which doesn't spawn hostile mobs and actually has a uniquely-spawning creature, Mooshrooms. But even those are so rare to find I don't even bother.)\n\nThere's a ton of unique loot with each biome too. I know what you're thinking; Minecraft has jungle temples and desert pyramids as well. True, but I'm in no mood to trudge over vast lands just to find a jungle or desert that doesn't even have a darn temple because they're ridiculously rare. And even if I did find one, what's the point of looting nothing but bones and rotten flesh? The chance of finding gold, diamonds or emeralds in these chests is beyond incredible. Terraria's naturally-generated structures are guaranteed to spawn within the world, with the exception of the desert pyramid (but even that got an increase in spawn rate with a recent patch).\n\nI get it, Minecraft is full of dungeons and other things. I'll also admit that the loot you can find in dungeons and mineshafts is well-varied and has a good amount of surprise factor. I don't have a problem with mob spawners either. But it doesn't come close to the variety of Terraria's dungeons. Most biomes have an underground extension of themselves as well, each with their own different kinds of loot. Yes, a lot of items will generically spawn in any chest, like torches and coins. But each chest is guaranteed to have something of peculiar value; this could be an accessory, a new weapon, or potions (which are so ridiculously tedious to brew in Minecraft that my brewing stand is collecting dust). Furthermore, these special items also vary depending on the biome. Makes sense that I'd find an Ice Blade in the underground arctic. So like I said, while it's possible to get almost every good item in Minecraft while staying in a single biome, you need to explore almost every inch of Terraria's world to get the full adventure.\n\nSpeaking of which: Terraria's sense of adventure is awesome. Each place you explore is always different from the last, with accompanying music to only add to the effect. One time, during my first playthrough in Terraria, as soon as I fell into the underground layer, out in the distance I could see the purple glow of Demonite through the darkness. As I stared at it, thinking "what the heck is that...?" the underground music started to play. In the trace-like part of the first few seconds of that music, a shiver went down my spine. I knew that this was going to be an awesome adventure. And let me tell you, it was. Exploring the cavern layer, raiding the Dungeon while fighting various angry skeletons, discovering shrines in the jungle and dying like a noob while trying to fly over the lava oceans in the underworld.\n\nThe Dungeon has a huge sense of history. It has different walls, and different banners to indicate different legions that once inhabited the Dungeon. Only, there are still the average Angry Bones and Dungeon Slimes. Only after you defeat Plantera in Hardmode, a message will appear saying "Screams echo from the Dungeon..." Upon revisiting the Dungeon, there's a whole swarm of new enemies. As you learn, only specific types of enemies correspond to their different legions, only spawning within the walls of the legion they belong to. So basically, these centuries-old beings reappear because their angered souls are unable to be put to rest, causing them to haunt the Dungeon and attack you. And even after all this time of being undead, they still remain loyal to the legion they were a part of so long ago.\nGulp, gulp... hold on, I'm drinking in all this atmosphere.\n\nYou know what else I love about this game? The combat system. Yes, you start off with a really lame copper shortsword that does nothing but poke things. That's nothing compared to Minecraft's wooden sword, as the shortsword has an extremely limited range, and you can't really aim where to hit. You can also make a bow, just like in Minecraft. I will admit that Minecraft's bow makes more sense in the way that you have to charge it first before firing the arrow, while Terraria's bow can  fire every half second as long as you keep clicking. But Minecraft's combat just about stops there.\n\nI understand, even Terraria has simple upgrades of swords depending on what they're made of. However, many swords are different, such as the Muramasa and the Night's Edge. I'll also admit that most swords have the same functon; swinging around your character at varying speeds depending on the sword. But some of them have different effects. The Fiery Greatsword sets things on fire and glows brightly, helping to illuminate caves when you're out of torches. And others like the Enchanted Sword can fire a beam-like projectile, which can help if you're out of ammo on bows or guns.\n\nOh yeah, that's right. This game has guns, by the way, and a multitude of different bullets, more of which are available the further you progress through the game. The same goes for arrows, because there's also a whole lot more than just a wooden bow. Once you make a repeater, which is a sharp upgrade to the standard bows, it makes sense to hold the mouse button and constantly fire arrows; because it's a machine, not a normal bow. Just as well, Terraria has a large amount of magic weapons, which are my personal favorite (Edit: Nope, Summoner weapons).\n\nAnother thing, this game has so many challenging bosses. I know, Minecraft has some of its own as well. But the Wither is completely optional and nearly impossible to summon, and the Ender Dragon can only be fought by finding a Stronghold, which each world can only spawn three of, making it impossible to find. Terraria's bosses are usually in a set order as you progress, and they usually drop epic weapons... or items used to craft epic weapons.\n\nI just realized there's a character limit, so I'm gonna wrap this up now. Terraria is one of my favorite games ever, and it has succeeded where Minecraft has failed. I say it is certainly worth your money, especially since it's less than half of Minecraft's price. Some might say these games are too different from each other to be comparable. I've played Minecraft in its entirety as well. But if I had to choose, it'd be Terraria all the way.\n\nWhy do I have to keep writing these walls of text?\nJust freaking buy it already.","April 8, 2014","true","185.7"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","20","23","3","7"

There are a lot of challenging bosses to fight, each with their own fighting style that requires specific tactical approach. And depending on how well you are equipped, regular enemies can pose a constant threat, especially in the areas that are meant to be hard. There is also a huge selection of weapons and magic spells (that act just like weapons, but require mana for each use) available to the player, most different from the others not just in damage they do, but in how they work in general. So the combat mechanics is very good when it comes to both enemies and the player.\n\nWhen it comes to environment, Terraria has a fair amount of different biomes, each of which is very well-designed with unique enemies, treasures and atmosphere. Terraria also has very interesting Corruption/Crimson/Hallow mechanics that is currently unique among the games of this genre. Corruption, Crimson and Hallow are biomes that spread over time, consuming other biomes, and keeping them contained (if you make it your goal) can be a real challenge in the Hardmode, where few things can halt these biomes‚Äô growth.\n\nIf you enjoy 2D sandbox exploration/building genre and somehow missed Terraria, you should most definitely give it a try! And if you haven‚Äôt played the games of this genre yet, Terraria is a solid choice to get familiar with it.","March 8, 2015","true","419.8"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","0"

I bought it while it was on sale for $2.50 which is like less than the cost of a meal nowadays, but, as one can probably see, gave me many more hours of enjoyment than any meal could have.

If you like creating stuff, there's tons of different building blocks and decorations and paint to make your creations beautiful. If you like destroying the world, EXPLOSIVES. If you like collecting pets, the bug catchers net will let you collect all the little critters in the game. And so on.

They generally quote "Minecraft 2D clone" and such, however, Terraria is nothing like Minecraft in its diverse crafting world and gameplay.\n\nTerraria is more or less based on epic boss fights, advancing into the game further, and amazing fights against mobs of enemies  in the ground, sky, overworld, and hell. The enemies vary greatly and each have their own special rare drops and common drops, such as money, which is used to buy from the various merchants that exist around the world. We'll get into merchants later. But now, let's dive into Terraria a bit more.\n\nTerraria has an astounding amount of gear, armor, weapons, and items that are used to craft boss summoning items and whatnot. The crafting system and just how diverse the item structure in this game never ceases to astound me. The player starts out with a set of tools - shortsword, axe, and a pickaxe - and lets them explore the world of Terraria. There is a guide NPC, however, who will help the player throughout the game, so the player is not jumping into an unknown world, but generally, you get to explore on your own. Oh. Don't worry. When you die, you lose only your money, unless you decide to change the settings of your character. After your familiarize yourself with the system, you further advance into the game by upgrading your armor and tools. Some special items are bought from merchants, which are unlocked by obtaining the different items they carry (finding bombs unlocks the Demolitionist, and finding ammunition unlocks the Arms Dealer, etc.), and building homes for them to live in. Items are purchased from these merchants with money dropped from enemies. More money is found from defeating tougher enemies that are found farther underground, and harder enemies are fought when Hardmore is unlocked by defeating the special boss in hell. Afterward, more and more enemies, bosses, and items are unlocked throughout the game and the player is free to explore and advance further. There's too much content to talk about in a review, you'll just have to check it out yourself.\n\nThe only bad thing about Terraria is when you finally defeat the ending boss and obtain all his possible loot. Then there does not seem to be a purpose to playing it further. However, there are a few more updates that are supposed to come out before Redigit works on Terraria 2.\n\nOverall, Teraria is more for the adventurous type of pixelated player. But don't listen to me continue rambling on! What are you waiting for? Buy the game already!","May 22, 2014","true","713.6"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

(The updates are free)  Everything you see is destructible, which is fantastic! I love landscaping the worlds, and building awesome housing for my NPCs. It's exciting to break through a wall I could not get through before, because I didn't have the right gear/powder to remove that tier of material. The more you explore, the better equipment you can craft or  find . As well as discovering underground biomes you didn't even know the game had , and recreating them in a different location to harvest the materials or just decorate with !\nHowever, I would have to say the main reasonI like Terraria is that it's one of the most evolving games I have ever played. I started playing it shortly after release on my boyfriend's account and enjoyed it, yet felt many things just... weren't quite right. I quit for a little while because Oblivion and Skyrim had completely captured my gaming interests at that moment, and the PS3 controller is just so much easier to use. This last year I began playing more Terraria, and really I like what the developers have done with the game. It took a lot of time to adjust, and a lot of research into what had changed and how to properly manipulate everything (which I still have yet to do, but look forward to).\nThere is a lot to learn, that is for sure, but the game is so much fun. Once you've read through a few  short, well written guides (or intro videos, easliy found online), and have found a few useful items to help you properly maneuver through the worlds of Terraria, you will likely find something that peaks your interest. Don't forget you are  not bound to the ground , there are Flying Carpets, Clouds/Storms in a Bottle, Umbrellas and Balloons that help you  fly  , as well as Wings later on . There are many goals in the game, but no exact order to complete them in. In every tier there are better materials to build & craft with & more dangerous playing areas available to you.\nI find something new in this game literally every day! Terraria never fails to amuse and surprise me, I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in building, landscaping, exploring dungeons, multi & single-player boss fights/mob fights, random world generaters, zombie survival, open-world sandboxes... or pretty much anything!\n\nEVERYONE SHOULD BUY THIS GAME!

The guide may hint you torwards your next objective in the some what obscure story. You progress by collecting new weapons and armor and defeating bosses but the real game starts  when you use your creativity to make buildings, monuments and just about anything the 2D universe can allow.\n\nApart from being a procedural sandbox, this game is also a deep and intricated RPG. There is a vast number weapons, armor, potions etc. to be crafted, found or bought, which helps you fight off various and colorful enemies, mobs and bosses. By progressing through the 'story', you get access to new items, blocks, weapons and armor to play with.\n\nThere is also multiplayer which allows for PvP and PvE modes, but the IP based connection may take a long time to initiate a game online. I would have enjoyed it more if there was a steamworks integration.\n\nSince it's release in May 2011, the game has recieved many updates that have not only made the game more accessable but also added tons and tons of new items to play  with.\n\nSo the conclusion would be is - If you  love sandbox games, adventure games,RPGs , online games , 2D games - then this game is definitely for you. If you do not like those kind of games then you should definitely give it a try :)\n\nMy rating is a 9/10","March 6, 2014","true","548.4"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/-TiLT-/recommended/105600/","-TiLT-","tiLT * Tt eSPORTS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/-TiLT-/","236 products in account","Terraria is an indie game for PC, console, and mobile devices. It was one of the first game to be inspired by Minecraft. As in Minecraft, you explore a randomly-generated world of blocks. Monsters lurk around every corner, and the only way to get ahead is by crafting more powerful items. You can explore alone or with friends, and in the course of play you'll discover a strange fantasy world of peril and wonder.\n\nThis does make for a much simpler game world. But it also serves to streamline a lot of the frustrating aspects of Minecraft. One of the most stressful things about Minecraft is the way that monsters can sneak up on you, as you have a first person veiw. With flat, 2D graphics, you can see all of your enemies out to get you at a glance. One thing I also enjoyed is that items don't wear out. Although I haven't played much Minecraft myself, things wearing out after you've spent hours finding resources to craft them, doesn't sound so fun. You're even given some tools right at the beginning to start off with.\n\nCrafting options appear automatically when you have the necessary resources. When you first start out, there's a NPC standing next you who serves a guide. Talk to him, and he'll give you some basic instructions to get started. They don't expect you to trawl the wiki just to figure out what's going on. You can build houses, and fit them out with chairs, tables, and other accessories. Expanding your home is a big requirement for progression,  If you build extra rooms on your house, NPCs will spawn, selling items, and helping you along your journey.\n\nThe more you progress, the tougher enemies become. The only way to cope with these ever-increasing threats is by upgrading all your gear, and it's this challenge that makes up most of the game. Your doesn't wear out, but there are so many weapon classes, and there's always just one more upgrade to buy. The world and enemies are amazing, you really do feel compelled to explore. There are so many different treasures and surprises to find.\n\nIn Minecraft, and other games similar, you often reach a point where you run out things to do. Terraria fixes that problem by including bigger and bigger enemies, and more and more cool weapons to take them down. I loved how there are so many items and weapon classes, even if some of them are a bit useless. You feel like you're exploring a real place, and figuring out how everything works in this world is part of the charm. I'm not sure if I have the patience to keep burrowing until I'm crafting my own laser guns, however this game will keep you entertained for hours. The game is decently priced, and often goes on sale. With how much you get with this game, such as Steam Trading cards, Steam achievments, (Also the option to save worlds & characters to the Steam Cloud), this game offers many enjoyable hours of single player, co-op and multiplayer, and is definitely deserving a 9/10.","April 8","true","70.1"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","21","26","0","7"

Terraria promises quite a substantial amount, and then delivers.\n\nThe Good\nThe graphics are 8-bit, but not 'cheap', with quite a bit of effort having been taken for the way things appear despite the low resolution.  Character customization is substantial, allowing for players to define who they want to appear as quickly and easily.\n\nAudio is decent, though the musical score may get repetitive after a time, cycling through different tracks for day and night, as well as for the different zones; night time deserts have a different sound to daylit jungles, to the Corruption in the rain, to the Hallow, etc.\n\nEquipment is varied and expansive, with an incredible number of tasks that a player can take, and tools to cover them.  A player could play as a gun-toting ninja dungeon raider, a demon-summoning architect of marble towers, a bee hunter, a fishing enthusiast, and more.\n\nAt it's core, Terraria is about exploration, and covers this with an exhaustive terrain palette, with distinct features that prevent each zone from being a cut-out copy with different color hues.  Ice is slippery, sand falls when there's nothing to support it, jungles have thorns, etc.\n\nExploring through caverns and tunnels is pleasantly alternating, allowing for players to traverse marble halls, granite caverns, lava pits, and more.  Treasure can be found in the form of minerals to craft tools from, unique stones to build with, lost chests of gold and equipment, plants to grow, and more.  As the game progresses, changes can occur to allow the player a chance at exploring new environments that are opened with the death of a particular boss, for example.\n\nCombat styles can be broken down into a number of equally-viable groups; yoyos (thanks to their partnership with One Drop Yoyos[onedropyoyos.com]), boomerangs, summons, swords, spears, bows, chainsaws, guns, flails, bombs, spells, and crossbows.  Pickaxes, hammers, and other tools are typically less viable for combat, but can still be used in a pinch.  Different weapons allow for alternate approaches to battle, and may give benefits such as heavy knockback, lazers flying off per swing, and so forth.\n\nMonsters are diverse, from the standard 'charge in and hit' to ranged attackers, spellcasters that can teleport, flying and burrowing brawlers, debuff and damage-over-time specialists, summoners, and more.  The AI typically has monsters seeking you despite all situations, though some will run when on low health, some will stop to collect treasure, and similar.\n\nBosses are neither standardized nor just 'harder hitting normal monsters', giving a range of single-target juggernauts, multi-target swarms, bullet-hells, and brutes for players to try whittling down, or grouping up to fight together.  Rewards typically measure up to the challenge that has been overcome, allowing for a sense of progression through the game.\n\nConstruction is quite in-depth, allowing players to complete projects of giant, labyrinthine towers with a lava-filled "eye a la Sauron", or sprawling castles, or farming fields, and more.  A set of simple 'mechanical' tools allow for some forms of automation, and enough different forms of material texture exist to allow a discerning builder immense free reign for their expression.\n\nSetting up a server to host a multiplayer game is exceptionally simple, both for "while online" and "long-running" server styles.  Resource usage is noticeably low, allowing players to enjoy their own server without fear of disconnecting friends from half a globe away, though latency does tend to parse poorly in transcontinental multiplayer.  PvP is possible in duel, free-for-all, and team-based combat, with items spattered through that can be used for competitive games akin to variations of 'capture the flag'.\n\nDevelopers are both friendly and active, having made numerous updates to the game project, including cross-referencing it to their other games.\n\nThe Bad\nWhile varied, the music selection per zone is limited, so staying put for something (like construction) can lead to the sound getting quite repetitive.\n\nA steep learning curve for new players, though mitigated by a helpful 'guide' who can tell you what you can build from materials you have.\n\nDespite the wide variety of textures and models, typically weapons, armor, and tools tend to homogenize at the top tier of play, neutralizing the customization on offer.\n\nMerciless with difficulty increases (such as the hardmode plateau), which can put off players who are easily discouraged.\n\nThe Ugly\nPlayers have no choice as to taking part in certain boss fights; various bosses will spontaneously spawn and attack regardless of player activity, location, or readiness.\n\nBosses can appear at the player spawn point, allowing them to repeatedly kill players as they enter game.\n\nSuggestions\nThe developers seem to actually pay attention to their customers, and have a steady update queue.  So, can't really say much for suggestion that the team doesn't already tackle.\n\nPerhaps linking the boss spawns to a certain gear score and/or time playing.  New players will be put off by finding that they just purchased a spawn-camping simulator.\n\nThe Summary\nEminently playable, more fun with friends.  8/10.\n\n---\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","August 26, 2015","true","77.3"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","23","30","2","9"

You can craft items to help you survive, battle, or build. The game is centered on defeating several tough bosses, ranging from somewhat spooky such as the giant mechanical skull, Skeletron Prime, or just silly, like the incredibly large shark/fish Duke Fishron. In order to prepare to fight these bosses, the player must find materials to craft their own gear. They'll go from makeshift wooden armor to the fabled Hallowed Armor, earning and finding weapons on the way. The game has violence in it which most of the time cannot be avoided. Finding some materials and sometimes just surviving means defending yourself against monsters small and large, ranging from floating eyeballs to surprisingly dangerous unicorns. When killed, enemies can splat pixelated blood that isn't very realistic. Most children and almost all teens can handle this. While not supposed to be a learning game, it does have some learning aspects, such as logical thinking. If I want to craft this sword, what items are most likely to make it? Besides that, it's not too inappropriate. The only other thing inappropriate in the game is that the player can craft a keg and brew their own ale and get an effect on their character called "tipsy." Besides this, I'd say it's good for anyone with a passion for adventure","August 10, 2014","true","46.4"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

You start off as a simple human, overcoming many obsacles, until you can be the best dark or light magician spawning creatures to fight for you, or have the best sword currently in the game and slash stuff and be the king. You can choose your way in many ways. You can build, kill and even dig stuff. It doesn't have sotry elements, but killing the bosses one after another makes me do that by myself. The best part is this game is now alive again. It has had many updates since 1.2 which was the biggest update ever.\nMusic - Awesome, suits the game in many ways. Favorite: Underground Mushroom Biome.\nGraphics - Very awesome, pixelated in a good way, the game looks much nicer in pixels than 1080p non-pixelated graphics.\nWorld Design - The backrounds are awesome as well as interacting with the world (breaking objects) makes you feel inside it.\nA.I. - The enemies are not stupid at all, they can see you. Amazing too.\nThere's no story or cutscenes, because it doesn't need to. It's too much awesomeness for a game. If you're looking to buy it, please, check the 1.2 trailer on this page and you will change your mind.\n\nTerraria. Awesome game to spend your time, but better with friends.A masterpiece without the need of next-gen graphics.                                  10/10","July 1, 2014","true","798.4"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

Terraria is a 2D side scroll adventure-ish sand-boxed RPG game! (really it is!)\nsimple enough by traveling through world up,side ways and mostly... downward. Also Fighting monsters and discover\ntons of loot.... surely you can solo this or with your freinds,how cool is that!\n\nSo? Anymore detail?Sure it is! Terraria gave you quiteeee a frustration at first about hints. For every detail there's a price.\nAnd for the first 20 minutes of the game I have to search the info from the community ASAP to understand\nof "WHAT THE HECK IS THIS GAME AND WHY ARE WE PLAYING THIS?". Soon the first and the biggest -CON\nsuddenly showed up.\n\n" Fustrations "\n\nAs I progress through the game, it tells you to start build a house with a wall.... you gather NPC and more. But in some point its still lag of something.... I can't fight or move anywhere left or right. Because the monster are too strong! So\nwe need to improve the character. This part of thinking makes 2 group of people.\n\n1.Meh! Boring! I quit because I don't understand what is going on and I don't want to.... -/Ran to DotA2\n2.What is this game? Can I be stronger? Can I upgrade my gear? Is there a Boss? -/Desperately gather more info\n\nThis is where my terraria start.... yes it's time for adventure!\n\nSo.... I really want to play this game! What now?Wiki is your friend!  cause the game don't tells you everything... but there's a good random events and boss\nalong the way. Not too much, not too boring. Aim for your equipment and boss fight! TONS OF EQUIPMENT!\nThis is where the fun begins, you want a sword? There you go! You want a Rifle? There you go!!\nYou want to be a wizard? There you go!!! You can be and adventure Almost every stance that you can find suits your play-style in terraria but you have to put up with it......\n\nAs soon as your Hunt the first boss down.... you want more! and more!!\n\nSo..... Basicly this game is?+It's a RPG game, with lots of weapons, Gears, Funny stuff and Boss to choose from!\n+You can play solo or with your friend!\n+You think this game is too easy? Try moderate! or HARDCORE! this mode are only for the REAL HERO!\n+There's no realdeal story here, but it's still fun to play and progress are along the way while you play. don't worry.\n\nAhuh.... I might interest in this game...OKAY! now let's review other stuff that's not a game then!\n\nGRAPHICS SOUNDS AND OTHER STUFF\n-2D Flat.... Woman cc are Flat.... Spectacular retro 2D graphics with rich pixelated enviroment.\n-Not laggy, Smooth game play and support for co-op, can sometimes be ram-eater for your PC.\n-dedicated server and mods, also 8 people playable. or maybe more!\n-Controls are understandable, modifyable and user's friendly.\n-Sounds are lovely done. Even the boss theme!\n\nSO yeah.... overall I've played this game until the last boss. and I would  say It's a good co-op game I'ven't met once in a while!\n\nhope this Review gave you some ideas.... annnnd Cheers for now!

Straight away as you launch this game you will realise that it is not a building game and focuses on adventuring instead. There are hundreds of Boss Battles and adventuring to be had in this game. The buidling is still fun and enjoyable though so don't be put off! The Multiplayer is really fun and building and surviving with friends is where the game really shines with friends.

I kept playing and realised that is not the case, the game is unique, filled with content and, in my humble opinion, even better than Minecraft.\n\nTerraria will take hours of your time because of how fun and immersive it is. There is an ocean of things to do, and you will rarely get bored. The combat is pretty decent (mainly against bosses) and exploring the world is one of the best parts of this game. There are several things that are really annoying though. NPCs for example, they are really irritating and stupid, and sometimes it may even look like they are trying to kill themselves.\n\nBut in conclusion, the game isn't perfect, of course, but it's a joy to play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dalmasin/recommended/105600/","Dalmasin","Dallenson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dalmasin/","72 products in account","Terraria is an exploration platformer developed by Re-Logic (Headed by Andrew "Redigit" Spinks and Jeremy "Blue" Guerrette) in March 2011. The game went through multiple updates ever since then, first culminating in the 1.1 release of December 2011 before developement ceased in February 2012. In April 2013, development continued with a promised 1.2 update that was released October 1st 2013. The game is availible on Valve's Steam platform and a console version released by 505 Studios around late 2012 is availible on Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network.\n\nGameplay: Gameplay is focused on a 2D side-scrolling playing field. Players initially start out with gathering wood from trees to erect a basic shelter for the first night. This may sound similar to Mojang AB's Minecraft but Terraria makes a more exploration turn. Even while mining, players can find underground treasure chests with unique items, accessories. Fighting your first boss of the game is where Terraria truly shows it's not any sort of Minecraft clone (even when people claims it is, Markus "Notch" Perrson supports the game). Players also delve into the corruption or crimson to fight the nasties hidden, a dungeon filled with skeletons, an expansive underground jungle buzzing with hornets and even beehives and the lava filled underworld as well. Even after beating a strong monster in the underworld, there's still a massive amount of content ahead that I should probably not go into detail of it all, as tempting as it is.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are appealing, much like an old SNES side-scroller along with some neat effects such as flames, smoke, rain and snow and despite it's almost cute style, it manages to be scary at the same time.\n\nSounds & Music: The sounds are simplistic but very effective such as tinks of mining stone or using your inventory. Meanwhile the music is composed by Scott Lloyd Shelly. The soundtrack in it's 2011 days were quite limited (Title, Day, Night, Cave, Boss, Eerie) before we got more varied soundtracks come 1.1 and then even more varied music in 1.2, some of it brought over from the Console version.\n\nGoods: Very addictive that can have you playing for hours on end (if five ingame day cycles pass, you've played for two hours because that's 120 minutes). Adventurous, fun to play with friends.\n\nBads: Some of the longetivity is caused by enemy drop rates being so low (for example, one is 0.025%) making some of the gameplay just simply killing enemies in the same general area for a hard to get item. It's also frustrating dying to a boss.\n\nOverall: It's cheap. Buy it. It's worth it.","September 24, 2014","true","882.5"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","3"

There is over 100 enemies to fight and there is over 10 bosses to fight so they will bring the difficult up.\nIf you didnt notice already but if you questioned who is that girl staring at the bunny beside these words well she is the Dryad who sells nature-like things like a dirt rod, a magical rod which you can move dirt (useless). There are over 20 NPC but only 19 NPC can be in 1 world (i dont know why but go with it) and if you want them to spawn, you must complete a certain objective which you gotta ask the guide which is beside you when you 1st enter a new world. Once you completed the objective, you have to build a house thats 6X6 with a door,table,chair,walls, and a `light source`.\nThere is a LOT of weapons to find categorized from ranged to melee and magic to summons.\nIt is recommended that you make at least a wooden sword during your 1st play. Many of the items can be found by killing a mob. NOTE: the Slime Staff is currently the hardest item from a mob (1/10,000) and it can be dropped from the most common enemy in the game, a slime. 60% the items you need are dropped from enemies and if i were you, watch out for mimics, for they are desguised as chests but if your near the chest it will expose and lunge at you with its teeth.\nAs you progress through the game you will need armor which if you wear a full set,you get a set bonus which is really helpful.\nTheres 1 problem about multiplayer and that is when you play on a new world server, many people tend to hide items that they arent suppose to have, either their too scared to actually leave their good stuff that they didnt get leget or they wanna be idiots by playing the game cheap.\nI give this game 9 out of 10 due to the popularity and the little greifers in the Terraria community.","May 4, 2014","true","683.9"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","9"

Just, piles and piles of the stuff, and I'd build things which, to be honest with myself, were probably quite rubbish. But I lost myself in these worlds, where the possibilities were endless and I could keep playing and playing and playing...\n\nAs I grew older, life started hitting back. My Lego got dusty. There were moments, when younger family came round, when the Lego would come out and I'd look at and wish I could have that feeling again - I felt like I would never really have that childlike immersion in something again because my brain is filled with useless things like how taxes work and how to open a bank account.\n\nTerraria solved that. I get so distracted in this game, there's so much stuff I want to do, and so much stuff to do. I love the freedom and I love the fact that there are bosses and quests to do but they're not shoved down your throat. There are elements of kookiness (the Hallows) and elements of seriousness (the Wall of Flesh, the Crimson) and nothing beats stumbling on some new area and thinking "I wonder if I can use these things to make a suit of bees?".\n\nIt's a fantastic game, well worth full price, and definitely recommended jamming with friends.\n\nAnd yes, you can make a suit of bees.

After a couple years and much patching, Terraria has gone from a game with promise to a game with fully realized potential.  It features an in-depth, extensive crafting system that allows for both cosmetic and practical items.  No resources you gather are useless - you can make something out of nearly anything.\n\nCombat is challenging and very fun.  A variety of weapons - both crafted and dropped by enemies- allows for every combat playstyle.  Yoyos? No problem. Swords? Sure. Boomerangs? You got it. Spells? Duh.  The armor and weapons that you progressively acquire really give you a good sense of achievement as you continue on through the game.\n\nAlthough I have found myself getting frustrated and rage quitting on some nights, the difficulty of the game only makes it more addicting.  I just keep finding myself being pulled back into the game despite dying several times in one night (depending on the activity I'm trying to participate in).\n\nBoss fights are fun and diverse, and the bosses all have really neat visual designs.  Building structures is a source of never-ending entertainment, and many different styles of building tiles are available.  The tools that are available later on in the game really add a nice touch.","August 28, 2015","true","182.3"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","6"

I used to have friends. I used to go outside regularly. Hell, I had ambitions once. Then I started using Terraria...\n\nFor years, I heard friends and family rave about how awesome Terraria was. I didn't really understand what they were saying. "...defeated Wall of Flesh with Hellstone armor..." "...Skeletron dismembered me...." "...built a giant set of genitals out of gold in the jungle..."\n\nIt all sounded too weird for my tastes. Everyone insisted I should play it. I wasn't interested.\n\nThen it was on sale for $5 during a Summer Sale, so I figured, what the hell...\n\nSince then, I've been in a downward spiral. I became so focused on building cool houses and terraforming that I often forget to eat, sleep, and talk to those who used to be my friends. I didn't realize I had a problem until my girlfriend came into my room sobbing uncontrollably, saying, "You care more about protecting these NPCs than you care about me!" Then it turned out that I had never had a girlfriend, but was hallucinating severely due to the lack of sleep.\n\nI've tried several times to quit, but the developers...they just...keep giving me more stuff to collect, endless amounts of things to build, and more enemies to destroy. I don't know what to do.

We built a few really nice things, and had alot of fun with the game 300+ hours later, the game has alot of replay value to me, trying out the different classes, making potions, hardcore mode, and hours of grinding.

However do not judge book by its cover. Behind the almost ugly, square like face of Terraria lies humungous world filled with adventure. Craft your own equipment and set to explore many underground layers, called biomes, each with their unique set of creatures. Gear up and face different bosses to get your hand on more exclusive materials and eventually face the final boss to push the difficulty to another level by unlocking hardmod.\n\nOn second look even the graphics are not as bad as they seemed. Sure they are simplistic and really "squary", but when everything gets put together the image can get quite amazing, considering we are dealing with kind of a pixelart. Some sceneries are really rather breathtaking and stretch your imagination to its limits.\n\nIn the end it is your imagination that is going to decide whether you are going to like Terraria or not, because the game is about putting IT to use in the first place. The adventures are only half of the game, the other half is about building whatever you can imagine and the potential of the game is almost limitless. Are you up to the task?","January 1, 2014","true","188.6"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

It nails everything so well, the environments, the music, the gameplay, the crafting, the exploration and mining, the difficulty, the sheer amount of amazing items you can get in this game, and last but certainly not least.....the bosses. This game has a suprisingly large amount of content, and I feel me and my friends have only scratched the surface of what this game has to offer. It's  just such a pure, fun experiance. The game is best to play with friends, and even better playing with people who have NO clue what they are getting theirselves into. I reccommend this game to any one who enjoyed survival games like Minecraft, and to any one who loves discovery, the unkown, and dungeons. This game has them, and they are scary. This is a title that stands on it's own against games like Minecraft. Which is good considering it came out a couple months before Minecraft. It has so much of it's own to offer, and I can not wait to get back into this contuining adventure of a game.

From fighting the Eyeball Of a Monster to Slaying the Lord of the moon, This game can get you addicted in mere seconds of gameplay. 3000 items makes it even better, including the weapons and tools, such as the final Prism that shoots light, to a portal gun straight from the game, mechanics and all. If you haven't gotten it yet, I recommend you buy it now.\n\n\n\n1.3, The Final Update.\n\n\nIn this version, the golem is now broken and torn up, and you think you're safe, however a new pressence sends you back to the dungeon to meet the cultists. They seem harmless, until you see they're worshipping a mysterious god. After you kill all 4 Cultists, The Ancient Cultist is summoned. Beat him, and terror breaks out. You must destroy the 4 Celestial towers with new weapons you will find, such as Daybreak and Nebula Blaze. In order to break the power that shields the towers, you must slay 100 (150 for expert) of their individual monsters. Then, you can damage,  then soon destroy the towers. When you thought that was hard, you're going face to face with the lord of the moon, the reason for the chaos and evilness of this realm. After a long and hard battle, you'll be seeing a flash of white as he decays into nothing but bones, and, with special loot too, you've beaten the game, destroyed all evil, and saved Terraria. And with that, you can live without Chaos and be in peace...\n\n\n\n~~~THE END~~~","August 4, 2015","true","712.3"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

By the way, don't be too mean and buy it(about 3-4$)\nMusic is beautiful and changes depending on which biome/area we are in. Yeah! it has lots of music :)\n\nLets go to the point body :\n\nIt is a wide-open sandbox style game; we can edit the terrain and go anywhere we want to.\n\nThe game starts in a randomly computer generated world. We start with three basic tools: a pickaxe for mining, a shortsword for combat, and an axe for woodcutting. Many resources, notably ores, can be found while mining or exploring underground caves. The player starts off with 100 health, which can eventually be increased up to 500 by finding special items (life hearts and fruit ones)underground. Some resources and most items may only be found in certain areas of the map, stored in common and rare containers, or dropped by certain enemies. The player uses resources to craft new items and equipment at an appropriate crafting station for that recipe. For example, tables or other items can be crafted at a work bench and bars can be smelted from ore at a furnace. Several advanced items in Terraria require multiple crafting operations where the product of one recipe is used as the ingredient for another.\n\nYou can encounter many different enemies in Terraria such as simple slimes, zombies, demon eyes, and various region-specific enemies. The occurrence of certain enemies depends on several factors including time, location, random events, and player interactions. We can fight against enemies with swords, bows, guns, magic spells, and other weapons. Each map will have several zones with unique items and unusual enemies.\n\nTo sum everything up: gameplay and musical design is so great. You will be an idiot if u had some money to spend and and didn't buy it.\n\n50/10 worth playing.","May 31","true","51.0"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","100","11","11","6","2"

I've never been trapped in my room for so long.\n\nTerraria is that sort of game that is very unusual when you get your hands on it for the first time. I found myself swinging at a tree mindlessly without taking into consideration that I have an axe! Then theres a guide. He tells you stuff. That's it. Terraria made me feel curious at the beginning because of that, and 2 minutes later I'm already falling to my doom right into a pit. Anyway, after a couple hours of playing I really didn't get the point of exploring and I got really frustrated then left the game in the dust until 1.2 came out. At the time I didn't even beat the mechanical bosses following 1.1, so 1.2 caught me completely off guard. That's when I got addicted, real fast. I played the game for A WHILE that year, probally racking up atleast 180 hours. I finally beat the golem, then ANOTHER update comes out, 1.2.4 introducing the new boss  Duke Fishron. I got to about 190 hours. Then 1.3 was announced. After it was released, I was stuck in a cardboard box.\n\nForever.\n\nAnd ever.\n\nAnd I slowly rot.\n\nIn my box.\n\nThinking about how dumb I am to spend so much time in a game.\n\nThen beat the  Moon Lord.\n\n10/10 would die 20 times in expert mode again.","July 7, 2015","true","221.9"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","87","13","15","9","4"

Yes, gone. That means farewell to hundreds of hours spent on hard work. I had lots of fun and great times with friends building mansions, landscapes and some few masterpieces of architecture. Now, all I have left are memories and screenshots.\n\nIf you kept your saves in another folder though, you can still find some fixes via third-party softwares found on the web, but until when will they work?\n\n\nBelow is the old review of mine from 1st January 2014 and it still applies:\n\nPros\nTerraria is a little wonder, a must have if you're a fan of Minecraft or Ace of Spades. You build whatever you want and the way you wish, get amazing creatures as pets, and have fun with people you meet and the evil slimes you beat, too.\n\n\n\nConclusion:A great game, but don't buy it unless you're sure to cope with big updates, which inevitably means future loss of data and personal time, and frustration.","January 1, 2014","true","267.8"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

You spot a slime (most basic of enemies) here and there. Then comes night.\nNight is honestly one of the most combat-filled times in the game. There are so many hostiles to fight including zombies, demon eyes, slimes and fish-birds.\n\nThe game itself feels like a bit of an RPG the way it's designed. I kinda feel like I'm playing as a hero trying to end evil in the world. There are quests (not major ones) set by a couple of NPC's.\nThere are 2 types of world (excluding the small, medium and large). You can either have a 'Corrupt' World where there is spooky music and flying demons called 'The Eater of Souls' or you can have a 'Crimson' World (my favourite). Basically the same thing but with different hostiles.\nProgression in the game is honestly rewarding and difficult. I genuinely feel like I have accomplished something in the game when I upgrade my armour and/or weapons. There are 3000 different items in the game and about 89 different hostiles which makes the game new everywhere you go.\n\nPeople compare this to Minecraft, I say you either go with a 5 year old's game full of squeaky children or you go for a buffed, more mature version with more to do and a variety of different people with different personalities that play it.\nTerraria with friends is honestly the most fun I think I've ever had.\nFighting bosses in the game feels absolutely amazing but it can really ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you off if they glitch inside you and spam the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out of their melee attack.\n\nOverall, the best game I think I've ever played (beside Battlefield: Modern Combat 2 on the Playstation 2 and Crash Team Racing on the Playstation 1).\nBUY THIS GAME NOW, THERE IS THOUSANDS OF HOURS YOU CAN PUT INTO IT EASILY.","November 15, 2015","true","85.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","10","10","4","2"

To finish the game in the 1.3 update you need to kill the Moon Lord... all the people are saying ,,Moon Lord down, game done'' no, no you have alot of stuff to do next, you can play in expert mode, a big challange, in expert mode bosses and mobs have more HP more DMG + AI and abilities (you can get more loot). When the expert mode challange is done you can actually play, let's say class challange: summoner, ranger, warrior and mage + more challanges like: sword, bow, spear, etc... and that's cool, really cool, it's the brother of the "Minecreft" c: and you can do nice looking houses, cool again, farms for biome keys for the biome chests in the dungeon (post-plantera ~ One of the jungle bosses) or farms for the events like: Solar Eclipse, Frost Moon or Pumpkin Moon. Farming the Bosses for better items or Dev sets in expert mode, in multiplayer can be some lag, I don't have but in big servers you can have, i'm not playing in multiplayer so is not a problem.\nThe Celestial Event comes with awesome stuff, after the Golem the Lunatic Cultist will spawn at the dungeon doors, kill the Boss and you will enter the Celestial Event kill the pillars and you will get fragments you can craft items with the "crafting table" dropped by Lunatic Cultist like weapons, with 18 fragments, fragments + luminite bars (from Moon Lord) = Armor for each class (Warrior = Solar Armor, Mage = Nebula Armor, Ranger = Vortex Armor Summoner = Stardust armor) and tools.\nA long review, yeah I know but I hope a helpful one too.

I'll tell you why.\n\nDon't listen when people say it's 2D minecraft. It's a wildly inaccurate statement. It's great because of it's (If I'm using the right word, hell if I'm not) voxel-based world. You can create, explore, and destroy, and the only limit is your willingness to put forward the effort. This game allows you to be rather expressive with your imagination; given, this game shines as a co-operative game for dungeon crawling, fighting all sorts of beasties, and building massive strongholds. Definitely a bit more fantasy-action based than minecraft.\n\nThis game definitely holds your attention for awhile.\nTl;dr version:\nLots of things to do, things to fight, weapons to find, lovely game.","April 14, 2015","true","156.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","11","12","3","2"

Terraria is the best Indie game I have ever owned. It has so much for you the player to do. Here is my separate ratings for some of the game aspects.\n\nMusic (8/10) Amazing retro soundtrack that fits the game so well.\n\nGraphics (9/10) The retro style graphics mixed with the music gives off a very light hearted tone to the game.\n\nCustomization (10/10) The building system in this game is perfect for the 2d world you live in, and the player customization is amazing with over 100 items that change your characters appearance.\n\nGameplay (9/10) The game can be played all by yourself which is really fun, but bring your friends into the mix and it‚Äôs even better, fight massive amounts of mobs and bosses with your friends for some awesome loot.\n\nOriginality (8.5/10) Terraria has plenty of unique game items and aspects to bring to the table and are pulled off fairly well, the developers have mixed in some great references to other media such as Doctor Who, Zelda, and more.\n\nThe price tag for terraria is $9.99 which is cheap for the amount of content and hours of fun you will have with this gem. It goes on sale fairly often so if you see it on sale and don‚Äôt own it yet grab it.\n\nNote: My grammar and spelling sucks I know sorry.","March 2, 2015","true","521.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","11","12","3","5"

Luckily for me, Terraria showed me that not not all sandbox adventures are Minecraft clones. I played with friends who were a mix of battle hardened veterans, and dirt covered noobs (myself included), but we quickly learned the value of having a group, and enjoyed the experience of constructing a small town with elaborate and unique houses, digging to the center of the earth, being attacked by a wide variety of deadly foes, and ultimately unleashing hell upon our little world.\n\nPlaying alone was equally satisfying, as the game offers a wide variety of things to keep yourself occupied with, but I still recommend finding friends to experience Terraria with. The beauty of the sandbox genre is being able to share your creations with others, and Terraria offers hours of just that.\n\n10/10\n","June 20, 2014","true","190.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","2"

However it might get boring for people who doesn't like to mine for hours to get armors, tools and weapons.

Sure, you can build a stylish base if you want (and it can be incredibly fun with a bit of imagination), but if you find that kind of thing boring, the game also has a lot more depth than just building. I find the combat a lot more fun, because rather than just a sword and a bow that only comes in one flavor, you've got magic items, guns, boomerangs, and several other different kinds of weapons that I really feel keeps combat fresh. Also, by endgame, you're so OP that it's hilarious to just watch everything around you burn. The multiplayer, while hard to set up at first, is also a blast. Who wouldn't want to beat up baddies with your buddies?\n\nOh, and the music's great too. I've always loved good game music\n\nThat being said, it's not perfect. There are still a couple problems with it, but they're just my opinions. First up, the game can feel a little bit too grindy at points, especially with the endgame loot. Some of the ultimate weapons are locked in chests, and require drops that are a 1/2500 chance to drop. (It was previously 1/8000... roughly about the chance of finding a SHINY POKEMON) I won't spoil much else though. Another problem I have is that after you beat all the bosses and become that ultimate one man army, there's not much else to do besides building and PVP. But hey, it was a fun ride there.\n\nSo where am I going with this? Well, first for you TL;DR people (You know who you are), I'll just list the pros and cons.\n\nPROS\n+The game has a lot more depth besides just buiding and exploring\n+The various weapon types keep combat fresh and interesting\n+The world, while not infinite, has a lot of different types of environments to explore\n+When building, there are a lot of thematic options to choose from, as well as a lot of options to decorate your buildings\n+Multiplayer is a lot of fun\n+You can choose exactly how punishing you want death to be (Lose half of your money, lose all of your inventory, lose your character outright)\n+The music is so awesome\n\nCONS\n-Can get a little grindy, especially for endgame loot\n-After you defeat all the bosses and are fully geared up, there isn't much else to do\n\nAll in all, Terraria is one of my favorite games on Steam, and you should give it a try if my first sentence applies to you.\n\nIf there's anything I left out, I'll edit this as more things come to me.","August 8, 2014","true","541.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

At only $10, it's a steal for the amount of replayability that the game offers.\n\nCo-op with friends offers countless hours of fun, as you explore the randomly generated world, fight interesting and dangerous creatures, and collect better equipment in an effort to constantly improve yourself for the bosses. It's one of those games that really makes time fly by. One look at the clock after playing this, and you'll wonder where your day went to.\n\nTerraria is one of the best Indie games that I know of for building structures. The amount of freedom that it gives the player to be as creative as they want in house design is truly amazing, and the structures that can be built are virtually limitless. Want to make a fully underwater headquarters? Easy. Or are you the type that likes to build a sprawling land fortress that's heavily defended with traps? You can do that too. Or perhaps a space station is more your style? Go for it.\n\nAll in all, this game easily deserves a 10/10. With co-op adventuring, building, and fighting, you'd be silly not to invest the $10 and have this game in your library.","February 10, 2015","true","593.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

You see, there is a sense of achievement in Terraria. It's got character. And you can't say that about many games.\n\nOriginally posted by Tom Mc Shea on GameSpot: Terraria uses an empowering sense of discovery to grab you, and that unrestrained freedom is a double-edged sword. Free to explore the untouched lands, you may happen upon a monster much more powerful than you, or you may find a chest filled with precious treasures. You're never sure where your travels will lead you, but your curiosity is always rewarded. You may gain knowledge, such as knowing not to talk to old men at night, or happen upon a cache of gold, which can be used to forge a powerful sword. It's a world bursting with possibilities. Terraria is an incredible adventure that continually excites your imagination with the endless secrets that await.","December 26, 2015","true","140.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","2"

Even the video trailers for this game, including most recent updated ones, are NOT enough to describe this game.\nI think I might even have to make a video review about this one, has a special place in my heart <3\n\nAdventure, mystery, travelling, exploring, fighting, running, sharing and having lots and lots of fun. It combines the elements of an open world, there to be explored and seized, while at the same time being an rpg modeled game(?).\nIf you like looting, there's tons of it. If you like epic BOSS fights, boom you got 'em. Or if you're more like me, and this is trully what I find most beautfil in Terraria, you can just spend your time away, building whatever your imagination comes up with. A lot of people say this resembles to Minecraft, which in some ways, it does. Excavating and mining for ores and rare crystals, to build them into an armor or weapon at a crafting table. Stuff like that.\n\nBut its just so much more. Even if its a 2D game, it has so much depth.\n\nYou can either play as a melee fighter, a mage, a ranged class, a throwing class, and a caster class (epic pets fighting for you and your team). All with equipable unique items, with different atributes. Even very rare developer items!!\n\nAnd without spoiling much, I can tell your there are a LOT of quests and bosses to fight, this game is HANDS DOWN my most played game in Steam, with well over 400 hours (Starting from the date when I oficially had it purchased >.<)\nI strongly recomend this game to anyone who wants a fun and comic adventure, and invite some friends to check your world, and help them in their own planets.\n\nMy final rating for this game: A green Slime / 10\n\nDont forget to invite me to your worlds =D","January 29","true","434.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/105600/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","I have absolutely zero interest in Minecraft and haven't done much research on Terraria, but I do know it was a 2D version of what 3D Minecraft is.\n\nI have yet to reach Terraria's full potential but from what I see so far, I'm liking it. I'm warning my reader, very easily can you spend a bunch of time playing this game. Why? You can literally make a stairway of dirt to the sky, you can dig to the deepest of the lows, and you can walk continuously left or right to see where the world takes you.\n\nTerraria is a splitting of Minecraft. Almost anything can be picked or chopped away at resulting in gaining a resource. For example, you can dig away at a stone, clay, or dirt block and add it to your inventory. With this, you can determine the topography of the immediate surroundings. Don't want a house above ground? Dig a nice big hole, put some wood or stone surrounding the hole or even dirt to find the altitude you want everything at. Besides building with resources, the player can place work benches to construct additional material. What's additional material? It can be weapons, can be armor, can be torches to light up a path for your player at night, can be campfires to heal your player, can be walls made out of cacti, train track for your mining cart, tables, chairs, or antiques that make your house look pretty. It is pretty insane considering the amount of control and combinations that are in this game. I feel like I can literally do anything and go anywhere. There is, of course, exceptions to this. The further you travel from your spawn point, the harder the enemies become as well as the terrain. Random enemies will spawn throughout the game such as walkers or flyers, but at night, zombie looking creatures will come and attack you consistently.\n\nThe enemies although a welcomed feature, can get pretty annoying after spending a lot of time fighting them. I personally find them numerous and annoying at times, especially when I'm building or cutting something. Traveling to different areas of the game yield different resources. The background/drop will change relative to your position on the map. I also have to add that the way they organized the characters and the worlds is fascinating. I've never had a head-ache free experience with something as similar as this. If you'd like to create a new character but use an old world, you can. If you want a new world with an old character, you also may do that!\n\nGraphics are decent and aren't meant to be anything substantial. The artists did a good graphical representation of everything, so it's somewhat difficult to confuse a stone block with an iron block. I did like the fact they added different locations as you progress the map, and the fact they added a day and night scheme. The backgrounds are dynamic and will change over time, even if it is the same background. Sounds are decent. You might go crazy after picking away at your 100th dirt block (*click *click *click).\n\nAll in all, it's a pretty good game with a lot to do. You will easily find yourself immersed in this sandbox game trying to collect whatever you can get your hands on. Though the premise is cool and the game play, I've had some friends have a hard time get into the game.\n\nRATING : 7.35/10\n\nThe price is reasonably fair but I would recommend a buy on sale.\n\nScreenShots :\nWhat my first home looks like.

It's just that addictive, and for good reason too.\n\nThe special thing about Terraria is that it isn't too focused on either being a sandbox game or an RPG. It's equally balanced in both aspects and that's what makes it so good. With hundreds of different monsters to fight, thousands of items to collect and infinite options on what you want to do in the game, it's not unusual that it still has a loyal playerbase after so many years.\n\nThe single player experience is by no means bad. The game itself has more than five years worth of dedicated development put into it and the amount of content it presents for its price is very surprising. Even now, the developers of Re-Logic are still working to create new updates for Terraria. However, while the game by itself is sufficiently enjoyable, the multiplayer experience is what puts the crown of sandbox games on Terraria. Playing with friends or simply playing on public servers online with people you don't know is just that much better than exploring a world on your own. I had barely played an hour of single player before going out to find servers to play on.\n\nLike Bukkit is to Minecraft, tShock is to Terraria. This server software greatly enhances gameplay, whether you're a server Administrator or a normal player. There are many other mods out there, of course, which you can also download and install to add even more content to the game. Most servers have plugins and addons to make them significantly different from one another. If you're looking for something to play with friends or even find friends with, multiplayer Terraria is for you!\n\nWhether or not you decide to buy this to play with other people, it's still a really great game on its own and it does go on sale very often. If you're a little short on cash and don't feel like paying $10, just wait till a seasonal Steam sale or a promotion on a third party site. Terraria is still very much worth paying full price for, though!","December 30, 2015","true","239.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

This game is one of those games you'll get stuck with for a long, long time.  Off Steam I played this for at least 600hrs. And now I am still playing it on Steam every now and then, since it sometimes gets huge updates that pretty much could make me start the game from scratch if I wasn't a hoarder. Many many items and builds with which you create your class from. Summoner, Mage, Ranger, Sniper, Warrior, Hybrid or whatever you want. It's all up to you.

It's a creative sandbox game that lets you collect, place, hoard items, upgrade, play different styles, explore, dig, burn in lava, fly around, get murdered, get killed by eyeballs, get eaten by worms, and have an amazing time with friends of any gaming experience online, or just play single player!\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  You're still reading? I thought by now you'd have concluded "this game is amazing because Atratzu said so. I'll get it right now and stop reading his review. I'll even forget to click the thumbs up button for all the writing he does".\nI'm just filling space, there's not really much of a story to Terraria, you start in a world and need to make shelter and then build more houses for your townsfolk (NPC's) to spawn in. You can interact with the npc's each one does something different. Learn to be good friends with your guide, and you'll do just fine.\n\nGame Play: The controls are pretty straight forward, a little difficult to explain in words. you need select tools to pick up certain blocks. Hammer for backgrounds, pickaxe for blocks, axe for chopping down tree's... there is a range of how many blocks you can reach, but most people can figure that out for themselves. If you can't... I'm sorry.\nYou can carry some accessories, armor, and then you have an inventory. It's very straightforward and basic. A lot of the fun of the game is discovering how to use the various items you get. Some items are vanity items, other go "pew pew" (I wish a gun someday would literally say "pew pew" for me)\nThere's a strong sense of progression in the game, it's very gear based and as you progress different gear has different effects, some lets you have more mana, some makes you tanky, some makes you move faster. Want to know more? check out the wiki-page or get the game already.\n\nAchievements: Achievements have been added, however I haven't started working on them yet. (I realized there were achievements as of 07/20/15.\n\nPrice: Terraria is $9.99 that might put people off, which is fine I didn't buy the game full price I got it on a 75-50% off sale. but even if I had payed full price I have now put over 500 hours into the game. The only games that I've played more than that are Minecraft, Guild Wars 2, and World of Warcraft.\nSo for me, it was a huge deal and value to get this game. For others it might not be so great, or put as much time into it.\n\nConclusion: I really don't have anything negative to say about this game. I do get tired of people saying "it's like minecraft on 2D". Even I said that in my first review... but if you play the game a lot you see more differences then similarities.\nI recommend this game to anyone who is creative, or even if all you did was play with LEGO's as a kid I recommend this game. The only people who might be put off by this game, would be people who are used to having always-high-action (example would be FPS-only Genre).\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update August, 9 2015:\nRequested edit: "You can make male genitalia out of obsidian too."\n\nEdit/Update July, 20 2015:\nAdded update about achievements (need another update later, when i start working on the achievements)","August 9, 2014","true","589.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Varexos/recommended/105600/","Varexos","The Clutching Clucker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Varexos/","176 products in account","Terraria is a very fun game.\n\nIt combines some aspects of sandbox, RPG, and general free-roam exploration. Especially if you choose a large world size, the world can take so long to explore. You can make multiple characters (with RGB color customization!!!), each with their own special names, make multiple worlds and play any character on any world, with three world sizes, and literally over 2,000 different things, let it be enemies, items, blocks, events...there's so much to do. Over a DOZEN bosses, two modes, three difficulties.\n\nI have two characters, I've played over 200 hours, and have not even explored half of each world, and not even CLOSE to getting all the best of the best items. Once you've defeated all the bosses, then they'res two more events to summon, the Frost Moon and the Pumpkin Moon, each with waves and the absurdity of fighting MULTIPLE BOSSES AT ONCE. Of course, absurd in a good way.\n\nUnlike some other good games, Terraria has a little built-in wiki. Several, actually, the foremost being the Guide, the first NPC you get. He can tell you how to craft things, unlike (sorry to bag on it) Minecraft, in which, if there was no wiki, you'd be CLUELESS as to what to make and how to use it and such. The guide will literally tell you EVERY RECIPE AN ITEM IS USED IN, and where it is crafted at. There's so much stuff, over a dozen biomes, and.....this is a beautiful game. (Plus, it has two wikis).\n\n9001/5 Stars\n\nPS: Vanity, so you can have awesome armor but look like an archaeoligist or a wizard, dyes, so you can change your colors, wings, because wings, and hundreds of hours of gameplay, FOR ONLY $10!!!. Like, a freaking amazing deal.\n\n~VoidRipper717","February 3, 2014","true","442.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","2"

And I have fun playing it with them. It's kind of like Minecraft turned into a sidescrolling 2D world. Kind of. But it's really a thing all its own. You build a home, a fortress, a village, whatever you want. You craft all sorts of crazy items, armor, and weapons. There are a lot of decorative features you can make for your place, and the developers seem to be adding a lot of content. When you get tired of doing this or that, you can do more and more, and then you can unlock hard mode which changes your world in significant ways... or not. My kids like to make a homebase on one world, then create new worlds to explore and mine together. I guess we have made something like Starbound with our imaginations only without any space travel. There are a few bosses to fight if you are looking for a challenge, and it seems like there's always something more to do. I'm not sure how it would hold up if you played to do and beat everything, because the worlds aren't all that big, but if you are looking for a fun leisure activity to do with your kids, give it a try. Check out the graphics before you do, and make sure they're okay with you. Check out the wiki to learn how to make and do different things. I don't think you'll regret your decision if you do get it.","June 9, 2014","true","292.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","3"

Terraria, Terraria, Terraria. This game is amazing.\nI became interested in this game when I clicked on a random video on Youtube. It was a Terraria video from Pedguin.\nI watched it. I immedietly started loving this game.\nTerraria is fun because there's so much content. I have played 241 HOURS of this game. And I STILL need a wiki sometimes. There are a lot of clever weapons, the monsters vary, the bosses are amazing. First of all, it doesn't give you a tutorial. That makes Terraria more hardcore for newer players. I love this. This game was inspired by a handful of games, including Legend of Zelda and Minecraft. Oh and by the way I don't like Minecraft anymore.\nThe Building: great. Terraria makes building enjoyable by adding LOTS of decorations as well. You can also attract NPCs to your houses, which they will live in and provide assistance. There's an Arms Dealer, a Wizard, The (stupid) Guide. Hell, I can't count them all. But they all provide clever and witty dialogue. And you NEED the guide to progress. Not to mention that they are all useful and most sell things while others can heal you and change your hairstyle. The money system is great. You need money to buy things from the NPCs. AND HOW DO YOU GET IT? By murdering monsters. The currency is from least to greatest; copper, silver, gold, and plat, or platinum. There is a lot of mining. A LOT. But it's usually worth it to get a new set of armor or a special weapon. The mining is great because you are ALWAYS under attack by monsters. Did I mention the events? No? Well, the events are awesome! Events sometimes are either summoned or just happen. The events are: Blood Moon, Goblin Invasion, Eclipse, PIRATE INVASION (yes), and the coming "Lunar Event". The Bosses. Ohhhh, the Bosses. Terraria seamlessely makes the bosses AMAZING. The bosses are a mix of bullet hell and dodging their attacks. The bosses are really fun.\n\nThere are a lot of Youtubers who play this, and I'm gonna point out a few; Yrimir, HERO, and Demize.\nOverall, amazing game. And it has even more potential.","December 20, 2014","true","295.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

My brother literally loves this game; he finished everything and built a massive mansion with millions of chests containing a full stack of every time in the game.  Absolutely tanked the game and they added in a few massive updates and now he has ten times as much more to do now.\nSo for it to still be growing, I think is a selling point a lot of people appreciate.\nIt‚Äôs a lot of fun and is something simple and easy to play on your own or with friends.\nOne of the best side scrolling games I have ever played.","February 3, 2012","true","103.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","12"

Terraria has become my new favorite game. I haven't played Minecraft since." (The guy in the story is me).\n\nNow on to the review stuff. Lets do pros and cons. Some are opinion based though.\n\nPROS\n-2D (opinion) I think it is actually better than 3D with Terraria.\n-TONS and TONS of weapons and tools.\n-Player creation. I think the player creation is great.\n-NO DURABILITY. Tools and weapons don't break. Build a pick, keep the pick.\n-Lots of unique enemy types. Demon Eye, killer glowing jelly fish, and so on.\n-Lots of classic enemy types. Zombies, Skeletons, and so on.\n-Lots of exploration possibilities.\n-Torches stay lit while in hand so you don't have to always place it.\n-Modern. One of the things I didn't like about minecraft was that it was set in times before tech. THIS game has guns, grenades, something I can only assume are jetboots, and so on.\n-Great gameplay and replayability.\n-Mods\n\nCONS\n-No creative mode unless you have a mod. (Opinion)\n-(This may just be me but) Hard to find iron and upgrade tools.\nThat's all the cons I can think of.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 11 out of 10.\n\nReally fun so you should get it!","December 19, 2014","true","109.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

You start off in a world where there are various different areas to explore. You can mine, build, explore, and fight bosses. There are many different items you can collect and use to progress through the game.\n\nOpinions\nThis is an all time favorite of mine. I like how this game combines a sandbox survival with a linear style RPG game. The world is huge, even if you chose "Small World". I like how there are alternatives in the worlds so its not the same thing every time. This adds lots of replayability to the game. The multiplayer is really easy to set up since it has dedicated servers now. The community for this game is huge. There are millions of very loyal fans to this game, and I am definatly one of them. I see this game compared to minecraft alot because of it's art style, genre, and gameplay. Ill admit that there are lots of similarities, but I don't agree with people calling this game a 2D Minecraft. This game has more of an emphisis on linear gameplay, while Minecraft has practically none.\n\nRatings\nGameplay: 5/5\n\nReplayability: 5/5\n\nMultiplayer: 5/5\n\nValue: 5/5\n\nConclution\nEven at full price, this game is a steal. There is so much content and so many different ways to play this game. As of 1.3, the game is pretty much finnished and won't see anymore major updates. But the final thing that develepers are working on is mod support, which will give the game even more replayability than it already has.","April 17","true","343.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","0"

Terraria offers it's own unique and thrilling experience the further you get into the game, whether it's spamming shurikens and knives at bosses, to picking away at ore pockets in the caverns and even just going about your stroll over to the oceon.\nRecently, I got playing this game again with a friend of mine, early on they kept asking 'when's the fun part?'.\nOnce we actually had semi-decent gear, she finally said 'Oh yea, this part's pretty fun'. Long story short, keeping new friends to the game is a struggle but rewarding, best times are on expert mode where you can start ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing about who gets what and framing ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• on each other.\nWith the updates that game with this game such as the chaotic madness of 1.3, they've brought so much more to treat yourself with, and makes all the effort and time much more rewarding.\nHow about the sountrack? There isn't a single decibel that i could complain about, it adds to the ambience and atomsphere of every level making the game even harder to leave.\nI took a look at the achievments and the percentage of people who've earnt them and I feel that not enough people are reaching these exciting components of the late game. People either than out of time or interest in the game and move on.  I can definately assue you that the game is worth every single penny.","March 7","true","848.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","2"

I really like this game, from the countless hours I've enjoyed mining with the music changing depending on what biome/depth level I'm in. I've enjoyed creating blocking houses while looking on with envy at the screenshots of amazing buildings people have created. Killing some of the many bosses with abundant equipment drops. Getting my butt handed to me countless times. Falling to my death while constructing and generally derping off way more times than I care to admit.                                                                                                                                    I don't know, I just enjoy this game in it's entirety. From that moment when you find your first wooden boomarang,the moment you find your first spear, the moment when you dig straight into hell and fall into a pit of lava.\n\n\nThere is always something new happening. Many bosses to kill and maim you untill you go full badass and womp em. Build your equipment up as a mage/fighter/ranged weapon user, or just combo everything! Armor sets that give you bonuses to everything from crit chances to mana and extra summons. I can totally understand how this game might not be for everyone but it has a style that just clicks with me. I whole heartedly recommend this game.\n\nCan you survive in this world and make it to hard mode? Or will you be crushed by the slimes and zombies?\n\nI've played this game off and on for a while recently been getting back into it, thought it'd be a good time to do a review.\n\nNot sure about the quality of my review though.\n\nOh yes! NPC's build housing for you Npc's and you can start a village and get some people to set up shop! From simple Merchants to Gun salesmen! Make use of the guide if you don't know what to do/craft next show him an Item and he will show you what you need to finish an item Weapon/Armor/Trinkets/thingies.\n\nThey have a hardcore mode if you wish to test yourself, with every map being randomized with equipment in chests and biomes tons of replayability.\n\nYou can also wear a bucket on your head.","June 17, 2015","true","339.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","6","6","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisisatrash/recommended/105600/","thisisatrash","Keem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisisatrash/","384 products in account","An old man awaits at the entrance of a dungeon. Stricken by a mysterious curse, he urges you to return after the sun has set, to free him of the madness that has infected his body. So you spend the day amid the grassy splendor of Terraria, surveying caves, slaying rabbits and slimes, as the hours tick by. Once night has set, you return to the old man, to free him of his curse and reap whatever rewards he wishes to give you. It turns out that the little curse transformed the old man into a demonic skeleton, a hovering monstrosity that unleashes holy hell upon your poorly equipped explorer. The battle rages for 10 seconds, maybe 20 if you run away at the onset, and then you're left staring at your corpse and wondering how you could ever defeat such a beast.\n\nBut there's no reason to be deterred by such a thorough beating. Terraria uses an empowering sense of discovery to grab you, and that unrestrained freedom is a double-edged sword. Free to explore the untouched lands, you may happen upon a monster much more powerful than you, or you may find a chest filled with precious treasures. You're never sure where your travels will lead you, but your curiosity is always rewarded. You may gain knowledge, such as knowing not to talk to old men at night, or happen upon a cache of gold, which can be used to forge a powerful sword. It's a world bursting with possibilities. Terraria is an incredible adventure that continually excites your imagination with the endless secrets that await.\n\n\nAn apartment complex reaching toward the sky gives your helpers plenty of room for themselves.\nTerraria debuted on the PC almost two years ago, and I was worried how such a mouse-heavy game could make the transition to a traditional control scheme. After a little practice, my worries were thankfully banished. Movement works remarkably well on the Vita, which makes sense given that Terraria feels like a 2D platformer. Performing precise jumps and grappling up walls feel even better using an analog stick instead of keyboard keys, so there's joy in traversing the world that didn't exist before. However, movement isn't nearly as important as excavation, and that's where patience matters. No longer can you dig precisely with a mouse; instead, you use a stick. The game has two options, manual and smart, which have different strengths and weaknesses. If you're clearing a deep hole, smart is blunt and effective. If you need to focus on individual blocks, manual works fine. Unfortunately, your cursor is controlled by both the right stick and the back touchpad, and there's no way to disable the second scheme, so you do have to hold the Vita carefully lest you dig haphazardly.\n\nTerraria is an incredible adventure that continually excites your imagination with the endless secrets that await.\nDiscovery is the essence of Terraria, but thankfully that doesn't extend to basic play concepts. The PC version struggled to communicate exactly what you were supposed to do in this expansive world, and though the Vita version doesn't spell out every detail, it does a great job of pushing you in the right direction. Shelter is the most pressing matter for a lone explorer. Chop down trees to gain wood, and then use that wood to build a house. Once you lay out the frame, you need doors and a chair to complete the requirements, and that's where you get your first hint at what makes Terraria so appealing. You're told to make a crafting table, and by standing near it, you can make the rest of the pieces to finish your house. And there are a lot more items you can craft beyond that. With a bevy of weapons and armor, clothes and decorations, there are tons of tools you can make that help you become a better explorer.\n\n\nA little snow never hurt anyone.\nThe items you can craft are clearly spelled out for you, so you're never unclear about what's possible. Once you acquire any of the plentiful materials strewn about the land, you learn how you can use them to craft something that could help you on the journey. Turn cobwebs into silk and then combine that with wood to make a bed. Melt silver nuggets into bars and then pound those into a shining suit at your anvil. By seeing exactly what items you can create, you're pushed to gather those materials as quickly as you can. You want that jungle hat, right? Well, you better find an underground jungle and gather spores if you want to sport that fine protective gear. An enticing cycle of hunting for materials followed by reaping a reward crops up in the early moments. Once you have golden armor and tools, you can venture further, which allows you to access even more powerful weapons.\n\nMuch of your time in Terraria is spent digging elaborate tunnels beneath the surface. It's there that the most precious resources are buried, so you grab some torches and try to fend off the skeletons and bats as you dig ever deeper down. It's a slow process that stays compelling for two important reasons. First, with so many secrets hidden below, you continually stumble upon exciting new areas. Maybe you land at a place filled with bioluminescent mushrooms that can be brewed into a handy potion, or find a makeshift house hiding a treasure chest. You never know, so you keep digging. Second, there's a puzzle element to digging successfully. When you chip away at rock in the deep end of a lake, you have to figure out how to manage your dwindling supply of oxygen while going further down. Or you may have to divert water toward smoldering lava to create obsidian. You're always planning the best possible route, while fending off enemies, which keeps you engaged during those solitary hours carving out earth.\n\n\nIt would be so much easier to mine this meteor if aliens weren't flying at your head.\nOnce you harvest enough gold to drape yourself in it, you may wonder where you're supposed to go next. Well, thankfully, there's a guide who can point you in the right direction. Building houses attracts non-player characters, and each has his or her own way to help you. The guide tells you that it's finally time to fight a boss, and even details how to summon it, which is a godsend if you're lost. If you have an explosive in your inventory, a blast-happy dude moves in who happily sells you dynamite and bombs. There's no way to know exactly what will lure more NPCs to your commune, so just experiment with everything possible. None of them are necessary to complete your adventure, but they are a handy resource when you're stumped. Just make sure you fortify your walls. You wouldn't want a goblin army killing your only friends.\n\nCombat in Terraria is often simple. Killing slimes is more about positioning than deeper tactics, so most enemies serve as a distraction rather than a serious roadblock. Of course, you could play with permadeath if you want a real challenge, or lose all of your items upon every death, but such consequences were so severe for me that I didn't want to venture forth, which defeats the point of the game. The normal option is that you lose money when you die, which is a gentle scolding more than a serious setback.\n\n\nDigging a helevator is the quickest way to reach the bottom of the world.\nBe prepared to die a lot when bosses make an appearance. Every battle is against a massive beast that dwarfs your feeble adventurer, so you have to be smart and well prepared if you're going to come out on top. If you collect enough shooting stars beforehand, you can craft mana crystals that let you use magic. It's much safer to shoot magical strikes from a distance than to get up close with your warhammer. Still, there are many different tactics to take out the various bosses. And, who knows, maybe you won't have a chance to plan out a strategy at all. The Eye of Cthulhu randomly appears once you've become powerful enough, and it's crazy to fight this flying beast while in a subterranean jungle. Always be prepared for a fight; you wouldn't want to lose your hard-earned money because you forgot your bow","August 30, 2014","true","74.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","3"

With the never ending updates and mods that comes out there will always be something new to discover.  You can play alone or with friends and still enjoy it just at much. The survival, sandbox and crafting is perfectly combined. Enemies are hard until you get better gear. And you will always have a hard time against your next boss. The game is paced perfectly, because of this you won‚Äôt get tiered from playing it too much. It might be a bit hard to find out how things work without googling. But it makes the game still fun to play. It‚Äôs not too much grinding after thing, maybe I just got lucky with everything.\nYou never feel like there is nothing to do. There is always something cool to build or a boss that you need to kill. The cool thing is you can build your own boss arenas where you can build defensive walls and traps. With the statues and some wiring you can build some really cool and creative stuff. And mods even add more to that. You have the chance to build fully automatic machines that can farm things for you. The further into the game you get the more diverse the armours and weapons get. So if you want to be a wizard you can get your magic gear and if you want to be a warrior you can build the tanker gear. In the beginning there is less of this which makes the game easier to understand and you will have something new to learn while you get into the late game.\nWith every update adding a lot of hours of new content you always want more. There is no stopping the need for more. It‚Äôs like an addiction. The game is very cheap and every update is completely free which is why the developers are very loved by the community. The game got released in 2011 and still get very big updates.\nSomething I used to get really annoyed at in the past was the lack of endgame weapons for each class. The summoner really didn‚Äôt have any good end game weapon. The best weapon was a melee weapon, it had the highest DPS. But all of this is fixed with the latest update giving all 4 different classes their own type of end game weapon, and not only 1 for every class. E.g. there are 3 different melee end game weapons. They have different effects and use but usually the same DPS depending on how you use them and what gear you have.\nThe developers really take in feedback from the community and mould the game after it. If you have tips for future updates just leave them in the forum and someone from the development team will probably read it. This really makes this game great. If there is something that does not work after an update the fix is probably going to be out in just a couple of days.\n","October 29, 2015","true","221.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","2"

Terraria offers it's own unique and thrilling experience the further you get into the game, whether it's spamming shurikens and knives at bosses, to picking away at ore pockets in the caverns and even just going about your stroll over to the oceon.\nRecently, I got playing this game again with a friend of mine, early on they kept asking 'when's the fun part?'.\nOnce we actually had semi-decent gear, she finally said 'Oh yea, this part's pretty fun'. Long story short, keeping new friends to the game is a struggle but rewarding, best times are on expert mode where you can start ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing about who gets what and framing ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• on each other.\nWith the updates that game with this game such as the chaotic madness of 1.3, they've brought so much more to treat yourself with, and makes all the effort and time much more rewarding.\nHow about the sountrack? There isn't a single decibel that i could complain about, it adds to the ambience and atomsphere of every level making the game even harder to leave.\nI took a look at the achievments and the percentage of people who've earnt them and I feel that not enough people are reaching these exciting components of the late game. People either than out of time or interest in the game and move on.  I can definately assue you that the game is worth every single penny.","March 7","true","848.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","2"

I really like this game, from the countless hours I've enjoyed mining with the music changing depending on what biome/depth level I'm in. I've enjoyed creating blocking houses while looking on with envy at the screenshots of amazing buildings people have created. Killing some of the many bosses with abundant equipment drops. Getting my butt handed to me countless times. Falling to my death while constructing and generally derping off way more times than I care to admit.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/angrytigerp/recommended/105600/","angrytigerp","Angrytiger [USN IRL]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/angrytigerp/","738 products in account","Terraria is oft-derided as "2D Minecraft", but I feel that this comparison misses the point. Yes, it was developed sometime in the beginning of Minecraft's meteoric rise, but beyond the aspect of having the world portrayed by bricks and allowing players to construct things, the focus of the games is entirely different.\n\nTerraria, unlike Minecraft, is -- even before mods, unlike its contemporary -- a game about progressing in an RPG-like manner through a steadily more-dangerous world. Yes, there are resources to collect and things to craft, but there the similarities end. Fundamental to the Terraria experience is the "Metroidvania"-style item collecting: You can find (or craft) new armor, weapons, and accessories that give you new powers and ability throughout your growth in the world. But to label it as a spawn of Metroid also misses the point somewhat, as at no point is it strictly NECESSARY to get these improvements; they simply make progression easier. For example, sure, the grappling hooks make exploring underground caves easier, letting you more easily mine materials for better armor and weapons, but you aren't stopped from making progress towards harder bosses if you don't have them.\n\nAnd this progression is the core of Terraria. Instead of having static levels or maps to travel, you get a single world, containing (as randomly determined by a procedural system) any or all of a mix of biomes from snowy winterlands, sandy deserts, flat plains, and the alway-present ocean biomes bookending either end of the world. Yes, the world is finite, but as it delves hundreds of 'blocks' into the ground (and, in the case of the Floating Islands containing unique goodies for those willing to build up to reach them), this limit isn't easily reached by most players except after literally hundreds of hours of play. Instead, 'advancing' in the game is dictated by defeating bosses, summoned by certain criteria, and after certain bosses you cause the world to change under your feet.\n\nOne boss, for example, guards the "Dungeon", an always-generated construction consisting of gloomy halls, spooky scary skeleton enemies, and plenty of unique and useful equipment to find. Only after defeating him can you get into it. Another is the boss of the lava-filled Underworld, and upon its defeat comes the game's change into "Hardmode", wherein a certain action after its defeats causes several new tiers of ores to be automatically generated in your world (transforming existing deposits of 'basic' ores). Gear constructed from these materials are almost necessary to have a fighting chance to fight the new bosses, allowing more and more progression, and so on and so forth.\n\nWhile on the topic of boss-beating, this plays a major role in a crafting metagame, where some of the late- and end-game gear can only be constructed from drops specific to certain bosses. While it gets "grindy" in some cases, this means that you are always pressured to replay some boss fights, and in the interest of making farming more efficient this means you have to learn new ways to fight them, or take advantage of new gear.\n\nLast, but certainly not the least, is base-building. While it lacks the grandiose nature of many of Minecraft's greatest constructions, the Terraria world does enable no small amount of player-driven building to occur, allowing everything from simple wooden huts to huge multi-level castles, limited only by your creativity and willingness to gather materials. This aspect will only provide as much entertainment to you as you allow it, but that's the best part of Terraria -- building is a sideshow, a distraction, NOT the sole purpose of the game.\n\nWith a new team of devs taking on the project and driving the game's growth (for example, Hardmode was a post-release addon, and basically doubles the game in doing so), Terraria is poised to continue expanding in all aspects -- combat, crafting, building, mining, whatever drives your experience.

Build, dig, chop, fight and survive are the 5 major elements in Terraria. Enemies that are small, to major bosses, you'll have your hands tied in an experience so great you don't want to stop playing.\n\nTerraria has proven to be one of the best 2D survival games for its multiplayer to play with friends, down to the part where it can be very hardcore to master. Terraria also has simple character creation, basically changing the color of your character's hair, body, etc.\n\nBuilding in Terraria is very basic and honestly great at times. Kill bosses to unlock npcs, build traps to protect your home from invasions or master it all with endgame gear. Yes, that's right: gear. Terraria has thousands of items to sell, keep or fight with. If you think you've done it all, re-think that.\n\nWith a new team re-developing Terraria, they have made the expectations high for Terraria: reworking a lot of in-game features and adding brand new features like fishing or mounts to make you play even longer!\n\nMy OpinionStill actively developed, Terraria is just one of those overwhelming games, if you've experienced it. Character creation is basic, which why would it be crazy? Half the armor you get in-game will basically cover your character up. Multiplayer is fun  when you play with friends, basically creating great structures, down to owning bosses. Terraria has been one of my favorite, well put together games ever since it released and when it was picked up to be continued via development.\n\nThousands of items to collect, hundreds of bosses to kill, possibly thousands of enemies to conquer, and world changing difficult experiences.Terraria will keep you playing for a long time.\n\nOverallI have no complaints. Terraria is a great game overall.\n\nRating: 10/10","December 20, 2015","true","258.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

At the time, the game was extremely bland but still had lots of gameplay. Re-Logic has gone back several times to create amazing updates for this game even after several times they said they were done with the game. I can surely tell you that 90% of what you see in this game was never around during the first build and it's truly amazing.\n\nThis game is fun alone and with friends.

I don't write reviews often, and usually when I do, it's to let people know I accidentally purchased something awful, and to warn them from making the same mistake.\n\nBut Terraria's fun!  It's good!  It's even what some might call charming.\n\nTwo-Dimensional procedurally generated world-conquering/colonizing.  Pixel-building/Pixel-Art.  Guide Voodoo Dolls.  These are just a few of the 'features' Terraria has to offer.  And as someone who's played from beginning to now, let me tell you, the Guide Voodoo Doll REALLY IS a feature.  I remember how much anger and table-flipping he used to cause me, and still does from time to time...  You'll never get tired of dropping his doll in the lava, even if it does summon giant walls of evil flesh with wormy mouths that pop off and try to eat your face.  Oh yeah, that's totally a feature too, killing the Guide to start a boss-fight.\n\nThis game knows exactly what it is and makes no attempts to convince you otherwise.  It's 2D Minecraft.  It's Minecraft if Minecraft had a better combat system, more content, more mechanics it could work with.  Mods might alleviate some of the mellow nature of a game like Minecraft, but it'll never stand up to Terraria in combat.  And Terraria knows it'll never stand up to Minecraft in the "Turning random things into beautiful art-pieces" space.  And that's okay.\n\nBecause while Terraria knows it's 2D Minecraft, it also knows it's not at the same time.  With a much stronger focus on gearing up for fights than just for the sake of it, Terraria quickly begins to make itself stand apart the first time you fight one of its many bosses.  From Cthulu's Eyeballs and brains, to the revived metallic skeleton that probably housed them, to EVIL EFFING SPIDERS WHY DID YOU ADD THOSE RELOGIC to towering Golems, there are a whole whack of bosses to fight, and a whole whack of sub-bosses and special bosses to find and fight in-between.\n\nIt's a much more customization-friendly game too, designed to do what it can to help each player try to stand out from their friends in-game.  The King Slime has your precious Ninja Outfits guys, but good luck with the farming, you'll be at it a while.  I'll stick to my Jungle Rose in my hair thanks.  But don't think that flower in my locks makes me weak, not ever since they added visual armor slots.  Ya never know when Santa might be wearing full Adamantite armor...  It serves him well to do that too...\n\nBecause sometimes, even the world itself tries to kill you.  Goblins, Pumpkins, Turkey's, Snowmen...  A few different invasions, and not all of them are normal things...\n\nDid I mention the game has seasonal events too?  Like finding snow and candy-canes around Christmas-time, Pumpkins and Turkey's during the months before...  I wonder if we'll see something Easter-themed this year added?  Hmmmm...\n\nAnd lastly, ReLogic does keep tabs on this game.  Official support ended a long time ago...  And then came back...  And then has been kind of in the wind, with ReLogic taking their time, but you know, supporting a game like this with genuinely massive content updates, minor patches, User Interface fixes and streamlining, re-balancing, new bosses, biomes, gear, special blocks and decorative blocks and craftables...  This is a game that sees more than its fair share of love, not just from its community, but straight from its creators, too.\n\nTerraria is a game that I keep coming back to over and over.  It's a game that the very creator of it himself just can't quite manage to stay away from.  Give it a shot, and maybe it'll be a game you keep coming back to over and over again too.","November 30, 2014","true","643.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

When you start terraria you create your own character in anyway possible to hair to shoes. Then you create a world, There are 3 different sizes to choose from when creating you world, Small, Medium, and Large. Small is a good size for someone who has just started the game, While Medium Is a good size for a more skilled player, Large is Good for a server more than 5 people. Each world is randomly gererated.

Take well recieved mechanics from 2011 Indie bomb Minecraft and combine it with the notion of gameplay being prioritized rather than the best looking graphics - and Terraria is born. A Indie developer clearly took a very, Very demanded genre and turned it to a side-scroller with pixelated art-style. As expected, people called the game a "Minecraft clone" and an imposter, today that is completely unreasonable. It is to be expected when new games comes along with relations to previous Video Games that people will rant all day about it's similarities. Once a few years has past, you realize that there is Plenty of room for fresh ideas no matter the genre.\n\nRe-Logic did the logic thing and took a awesome game mechanic with high demands, and made something new with it. The entire Survival genre had been unknown territory until Minecraft triumphed along and showed people what can really be done with the right focus on gameplay and not graphics. The notion of starting out as a weakling, no armor, no weapons in a hostile, unknown world. Slowly progress to make your first tool, build a shelter, slaughter something for food. I think you can relate to that rewarding feeling when it feels like you have survived the first night, and you are a bit stronger than the day before.\n\nTerraria has mechanics that extend futher than the ones of Minecraft, namely it's RPG addition. You do not level up, but you will gradually evolve with more Health Points and progress through difficult enemy encounters, boss fights and challenging environments. Loot is also a factor in this game, you will find random chests that will cease your hunger for luxury weapons and items. The boss fights also provide as gateways, once beaten you will be able to craft one higher tier of armor, weapons and tools. Giving the game a progression system and a goal, and ultimately - an actual ending.\n\nThere is a very long way throughout a complete game though. If you decide to play on the Large map size, it will take hours to find all the biomes on the surface, as well as countless of hours under ground and to some extent - in the clouds. The progression comes naturally, as you have to extend your mining, crafting and hunting opperation deeper and more further out, to proceed. When you are tired of mining, then hunt, when tired of hunting, build. Your small house will eventually grow to a massive fortress, even with NPC's players in it to help you in your journey.\n\nSomething that I have not tried too much is the PVP mechanic of the game, which is also something unique with this game. You can essentially team up into up to 4 teams, and play your game while being under the threat of other players on the same world. Try and infiltrate the other team's base of opperation to slow their progress, or meet up for an epic PVP battle. Of course you can all choose to play coop and focus the imminent threat of the hostile world you are all in instead of fighting each other.\n\nAs mentioned, new genres will go through a bumpy road before the community accepts it being a new genre. Survival games are no different. Today, a few years later, we see a lot of survival games, and we do not judge them for it. It is a very fun genre for Video Games, and Terraria is no different - You will spend 100+ hours into this game if you are into the genre. Few games have grabbed me as much as Terraria have, with over 300 hours in it and I have yet not done everything there is. The game is still getting updates too, not only on PC but the game is available on Playstation 3, Playstation Vita and even mobile devices. In the end, this game became a very successful title, today with a little "clone" of it's own - Starbound.\n\nDo pick this up if you are interested in survival games, you will not regret it! Terraria is also an excellent pixel-art building simulator. For the modern little brother, check out Starbound (Review)","March 19, 2012","true","379.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"

There really is not much to say about this game as it is really straight forward, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nI would like to start off by saying I have played a limited amount of time with this game and I have limited knowledge of it, so please understand this as you read my review. The first positive thing is the idea of the game. Someone has gone ahead and made a simpler version of MineCraft at a cheaper price (sort of). But honestly, that's also a negative, great idea, but you ripped it off someone...\n\nNow onto the actual game, it's frustrating that's for sure, in the 1 hour that I played it I made a good underground house (imo) and I was beginning to like it, then in about the period of 5 minutes I died maybe 5-6 times and my house became ridden with creatures. Certainly not the start I was looking for, but fun to deal with. In the next .7 hours it became apparent that I was a 'noob' the amount of crafting recipes and formulas was never ending, and I realised that this was not a simplified MineCraft, but rather a more advanced Minecraft...\n\nThere, that's all I learnt from like 1.7 hours of it, do as you please, I sit on the fence.\n\nOverall Rating: 7/10","September 12, 2014","true","1.7"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","4"

Like some people, when I first came into Terraria, I exepcted something of a 2d Minecraft. After spending 40mins trying to figure out how to place a damn door, I realized that this really shouldn't be compared to Minecraft alone. This game feels like something of a hybrid between Minecraft and Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. Yes, it sounds strange to say that, but considering the items you can get, the boss battles, and the general atmosphere of the game, I feel that is pretty much what Terraria is. That being said, it is unique in a lot of ways and highly worth getting.\nIt may be confusing, difficult, or frusterating at first (I didn't look at the wiki until at least a good 15 hours into it, so that might explain that), but once you pass that hump, it is quite enjoyable.

There are also places like the Ice bioume, Crimson, Croupted, Jungle. And Mini bioumes like the bee hive, floating islands, and metors! There is also multiplayer, servers that can be 2p game, to capture the gem! Altough it loses points for not being always updated it regains them for Terraria 2. Software from here is good.

Don't get me wrong it's a good game but there are flaws like Rod of discord grapple flaw. It's been patched and stuff have chagned. I can't wait Till Terraria 2. Good game, Good second.

It's not only my favorite game, but a game that's very special to me on a personal level for a lot of reasons.  I've spent many happy hours playing this game, goofing off and laughing with the person I'm playing with.  I listen to the soundtracks (first one at least) regularly.  I got a tattoo from this game to symbolize my love for it (well, also my love for bunnies because it's a bunny from the game, but my love for the game is part of the meaning).  It's a fantastic game and I love it a lot.\n\nIt's hard to describe exactly what kind of game Terraria is.  It's a 2D platformer, but it's open world.  It's a sandbox game, but it has RPG elements.  It's an adventure game, but it's also a survival game.  It's many things rolled into one spectacular experience.\n\nThere's something for (almost) everyone in Terraria.  Like exploring?  Go exploring.  Like combat?  Plenty of things to fight.  Like crafting?  Gather materials and craft away.  Like building?  You can make some incredible structures in this game.\n\nThere is no real lore to the game.  There are no set parameters for what to do or how to play.  You spawn with crude tools, and the rest is up to you.  There is a distinct progression - some biomes are more difficult than others and most people make it their goal to constantly upgrade their gear to progress through them - but even that is optional, and if you choose to do it, how you do it is completely in your hands.\n\nA nice thing about Terraria is that the game can be tailored to your preferences in a number of ways.  For difficulty, there's the "normal" mode, Softcore, Mediumcore in which you drop all your items when you die and have to go retrieve them (lest they disappear), and for those who want a real challenge, there's Hardcore mode with permadeth.  You can also choose if you want a small, medium, or large map to explore and build in.  Characters aren't tied to worlds either - any character can go to any world you make.  Play across multiple worlds if you want to.\n\nThe amount of content in this game is ridiculous too.  As of the time I'm writing this (April 2015), there are  2835 items in the game.  That's a lot.  There are 401 different enemies and 13 (regular) bosses, with several others that spawn during the optional combat events that can be triggered by the player in game.  There are many biomes providing a vast range of environments also, in addition to unique enemies and loot.  There's even another update coming, tentatively scheduled for June of this year, that will contain hundreds of new items and much more.\n\nAlthough I have no experience with any of this, there are many external tools that can alter your playing experience.  There are mods if you want to change up the content of the game, map viewers and editors if you want to check out your whole world or change something about it, even inventory editors if you just don't feel like searching for, farming, or crafting that particular item (the inventory editor does come in handy if you want to make a world just for building but don't want to actually explore and work for the materials).\n\nSince your worlds are randomly generated and the loot and items always vary, the game has a ton of replay value.  You have the freedom to do anything you want when you play, then to start up a new world/character and play that one however you want too.  Due to the random nature of everything, after hundreds of hours I have never tired of this game, and almost all those hundreds of hours were before the big update a year and a half ago that added 1000+ items.\n\nThis game also has wonderful drop-in/drop-out multiplayer.  I have played all but a few (<10) of my hundreds of hours with someone, and it is exponentially more fun to have a friend to build, fight, and explore with.  It does make things easier, however, since there are two of you to gather materials and fight.  A couple things about multiplayer I will say though - One, since this game allows you to have so much control over what you do and how you play, multiplayer might not be for you if you think you'll butt heads with someone else over how to do things.  I have not encountered this myself, but I imagine it would be difficult to play with someone who has an entirely different vision of how to play than you.  Secondly, there is a lot of potential for griefing in this game.  People can steal your stuff, blow up your structures, all sorts of crap, so be careful of who you play with (I only play with my boyfriend, for instance).  Wouldn't want someone in multiplayer to screw you over.\n\nAs for the look and feel of the game itself, the environments and enemies are colorful and vibrant, with beautifully done pixel art.  The original soundtrack, composed by Scott Lloyd Shelly, is fully instrumented (not just chiptune or electronic), and the songs fit their individual situations (there are unique songs for different biomes, bosses, weather events, etc.) perfectly.  There are two soundtracks, the original and the one for the giant update from October of 2013, that can be purchased[re-logic.bandcamp.com] (or whatever) if you enjoy the music.\n\nAll in all, this game gets a 10/10 from me.   The varied and vast content paired with all the freedom it gives you to do what you want, in addition to the beautiful visuals and music, all come together to create a fun, unique experience that could provide nearly anyone with hours of entertainment.  After hundreds of hours and countless fun and special memories of playing myself, I have not grown sick of this game in the slightest and I'm sure a lot of people wouldn't either.\n\nSidenote:  Terraria is also available on Xbox 360, PS3, and Android.  The console version and Android version each have unique content.  I have not played the console version, but the Android version is great (note: not as much content as the PC version!) and I highly recommend that too if you like Terraria.  Much easier on a tablet than a phone though.","April 25, 2015","true","472.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I say the greatt combination of those two. THere are some simple rules in the game and that allows you to get really creative. While there are also many bosses and mobs to grind for items. Different biomes with different enemies, make the world worth exploring. Numerous crafting recipes that will satisfy every type of gamer will surely be the highlight as even some building block need to be crafted.\nIf you heard about Terraria from someone who refered to it as cheap 2d Minecraft clone then i suggest you forget that descriptive review and read this next part. Andrew 'Redigit' Spinks has said upon release that game is inspired by Minecraft, but if you look beyond the surface of 'Sandbox' Genre you'll notice some key differences. So here we go:\nMinecraft has lots of building and not so many mobs and bosses.\nTerraria on the other hand, although it has many building block, wires and hidden entrances is still just a 2D game, don't get me wrong you can still make wonderfull buildings or Pixel art, but you're bound by only two dimensions. Terrraria does however have more enemies items mobs and most importantly spells.\nSo let's put it like this, Minecraft great for 3D building, Terraria great for fighting and Pixel Art\nMy favorite thing about Terraria is the community of Terraria Online forums. Even if you don't own the game join the forums many people there often make Giveaway Raffles or contests so be sure to watch out for some prizes.","February 13, 2014","true","203.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

However, underneath its crafting, mining and exploration based surface, lies a game brimming with content and adventure. The game's main concepts revolve around the mining of various resources to craft new weapons and armours, or to design and build houses and structures. This crafting system ties in well with the game's combat and exploration aspects, and gives a greater sense of progression. There're many hidden treasures to be found, along with a multitude of customisation options. The combat is very fast paced and the amount of content featured is astonishing.

This is a must buy.\n\nEdit: Almost 3 years later from the original writing of this review.  More content, dedicated servers, more content... did I mention more content?

Buy this game and convince all your friends to buy it too, you won't regret it.\n\nObviously, there's the survival side of gameplay - exploring, crafting, mining, et cetera, just like Edge of Space, Starbound, and other games of this genre. What defines Terraria, for me at least, are the abundant boss battles. Boss battles in Terraria are plentiful, and possibly the most varied I've seen in a long time; the bosses range from something as simple as a giant slime, all the way to  The Moon Lord, a colossal Cthulu-esque monstrosity that serves as the final challenge .\n\nThe graphics are, for the mostpart, cute and bright. The pixel art is done spectacularly, and the NPC sprites have been given a revamp in the 1.3 update. Although the Comic Sans text isn't superb, it fits the style of Terraria well.\n\nWithout a doubt, you should give this game a try, it's worth so much more than the price.\n\n10/10, would be mutilated by unicorns again.","June 6, 2015","true","407.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

But it stops there. Even those concepts are so much more different from minecraft. It is a great game, and it has great replay value. It is more RPG focused than minecraft (Especially if you download Nterraria), and it can take real life weeks to get to "Endgame", at which point, you are ready to begin the mid level of game.\nHighly Reccomend.","November 5, 2014","true","178.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

First of all, If you like 2d sidescrollers you would like the consept of this game. Merge it with awsome bosses, wepons and uber cool events you got yourself a game. Terraria the jaw-droping game is cool because of stuff like mana. Ever used magic in a RPG and wanted to use it in a adventure game? Well now you can! There are also places like the Ice bioume, Crimson, Croupted, Jungle. And Mini bioumes like the bee hive, floating islands, and metors! There is also multiplayer, servers that can be 2p game, to capture the gem! Altough it loses points for not being always updated it regains them for Terraria 2. Software from here is good. I recommend this game for the First-Stop-Shoper thing. You make your own char and you get stronger when you play so I give this game a... *drumroll*  8/10! Don't get me wrong it's a good game but there are flaws like Rod of discord grapple flaw. It's been patched and stuff have chagned. I can't wait Till Terraria 2. Good game, Good second. There may even be a third.\nSo did I do a good job? If you got it beacuse of me then...*blush* Thanks! You can also become my friend if you have it or get it.

There is so much to do and collect that at this point, I don't think I'll ever be able to find every item. Terraria has great replayability and since your characters can visit any world, it allows you to begin anew without losing your progress. I've set up a gigantic storage world so I can horde every item and block I've ever collected and my collection continues to grow. But out of all this, the best part of Terraria is co-op.\n\nSince the game progression is fast paced, you can start a game with a friend and reach end-game in about a week or sooner depending on how long you play for. Co-op really works well in this game mainly because the fighting style. Spelunking with a friend is always safer especially once you plunge into hardmode. And the boss fights are a blast with more people.\n\nThe environments and random terrain generation create beautiful environments to explore. The textures and lighting fit perfectly together and the unique game music is the icing on the cake.\n\nSo basically what I'm trying to say is: I love this game! I've put a ridiculous amount of time into Terraria and I even feel that the game is worth way more than the full price.","July 14, 2013","true","916.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

With unique art style and sort of new gameplay, Terraria is a great choice for new sandbox/survival gamers. Through my time of playing Terraria, I have found an attachment to the game like no other! The unique weapons and armour, plus the amazing (yet some difficult) monsters you face! Not to add, but the music and sounds for the game add a hint of retroness to the game itself, making this game's soundtrack a taste of my liking :). Not to forget, those spine-chilling boss battles with so much difference between them, a huge challenge for new beginners and great fun for semi-pros to pros. Terraria unfortunately falls a bit short with the reason being that the superb game is only available on Windows computers, meaning Macintosh and Linux users don't get the awesome gameplay that Terraria has to offer. Overall, Terraria is an excellent game with Exciting new bosses, difficult adventurous dungeons, new monsters to battle and a wide variety of awesome stylish weapons plus defence.\n\nMy rating for Terraria is as followed:\n\nGameplay: 6/10\nLandscape: 7/10\nUniqueness: 9/10\nGraphics: 8.5/10\nFun I Had Playing It!: 8/10\n\nAverage: 7.7/10\nRating: B\n\nYours sincerely,\nLiam","September 2, 2014","true","92.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Those 2 games are completely different from each other because Terraria is more focused on dungeons/PvE/PvP while Minecraft is more focused on the building part. Of course you do a lot of PvP and PvE in MC as well but in Terraria it's an essential part of the game.\nI really enjoyed playing this game especially with friends. It's really funny to mine around with friends, farm things to kill your first boss, to loot the dungeons and so on!\nThe only thing I have to say is that once you did everything in the game it gets reaally boring. Ofc they try to update the game as much as possible but often times it's mainly a little patch bringing up a few more items.\nThis game is a must-buy game when it's on sale if not a must-have game overall!","February 18, 2014","true","160.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

If you're looking for something in praticular check the index below but this review dives really deep into how Terraria isn't like Minecraft at all. It is also in beta which means more content will be added in the future.\n‚òÖ 1. Terraria vs. Minecraft (long) ‚òÖ\n‚òÖ 2. Building Aspects ‚òÖ\n‚òÖ 3. Weapons ‚òÖ\n‚òÖ 4. Mobs ‚òÖ\n‚òÖ 5. Npcs ‚òÖ\n‚òÖ 6. Rating ‚òÖ\n\n‚úß So Terraria vs. Minecraft. Let me just say first of all Terraria is such a better game. More things to do, items to craft, weapons to kill monsters with, monsters that actually have a purpose (not to mention there are 235 before 1.3), bosses, tools and ores.  ‚úß\n\n‚úß Terraria is 2D, Minecraft is 3D  ‚úß\nThis comes up quite a lot in arguments about which game is better for people. I guess some could say that it matters what dimension the game is in or what not. Yes, Terraria is 2D, no there isn't anything wrong with that. It reminds me of Super Mario Bros. or games from the past or the nintendo entertainment system. Minecraft is in 3D, umm...cool? I don't really care all you squeakers...\n\n‚úß New World  ‚úß\nI am excited when I start up a world in Terraria. Wondering if I would get Corruption or Crimson, copper or tin, iron or lead, silver or tungsten, gold or platinum. The combinations vary. Will I spawn by any chests? Will I get a cool place with a ton of tall trees? Will a pinky come by, by chance? If I play Minecraft I always spawn in some boring forest or grassland. There isn't much to do in them, no hidden chests. So basically starting a Minecraft world is pretty boring.\n\n‚úß Progression through game  ‚úß\nI am in my Terraria world, got some nice armour and weapons. Now I am ready to fight my first boss, the eye of cthulhu! Nice, he's defeated. Next one eater of worlds! Minecraft: Oh, I'm walking around still haven't found a good place to build my house yet. Oh, I found some iron, yipee?\n\n‚úß End  ‚úß\nTerraria: Yes! I have fought 19 bosses so far! Time for number 20, duke fishron! I got my mythical razorpine, and my legendary terrablade too. Minecraft: I am fighting my first boss, the enderdragon. It is such a coward it flies away from me and attacks rarely.\n\n‚úß Weapons  ‚úß\nTerraria has wayyyy more weapons in Minecraft, I mean lets be honest here. What does Minecraft have? 5 types of swords and one bow? that is quite embarassing, it really is. I mean Terraria has at least 60+ swords alone not to mention all the other ranged bows, repeaters, and GUNS. Oh, you need mods to get stuff like that in Minecraft. What is a seven attack damage diamond sword going to do to a 100 defense, 500 heart Terraria player?\n\n‚úß Mods  ‚úß\nTerraria doesn't need mods to be awesome. It just already has enough stuff to be amazing. In Minecraft, you sort of need mods to have a good time. Terraria mods actually add a whole crap ton of stuff to the game while a lot of Minecraft mods like the "lucky block" mod adds stuff that is pointless.\n\n‚úß Price  ‚úß\nMinecraft is $26.95! How could they charge so much money for such a poorly updated game.\nTerraria is $9:99 which always goes on sale for $1:99! Amazing game = amazing prices.\n\nThat'll wrap up Minecraft stuff for now, I'll be adding more stuff there in a while.\n\n‚òÖ Terraria Building ‚òÖ\n\nIn Terraria there is so many building variations, blocks, walls, furniture, paints it simply blows my mind. Never have I seen a sandbox game with this many ways to build. Make a boreal wood house, or maybe a mythril brick castle. An underground house with lava flow walls or starry night wallpaper. Paint my golden chests blue to make them look awesome. I can build biome boxes, or amazing pixel art. There are bricks that light up, blocks that change colour (rainbow block)\n\n‚òÖ Terraria Weapons ‚òÖ\n\nThis is one category where Terraria is huge, the amount of weapons. There are so many wepaons I can farm for, craft, collect, kill with! a dolphin gun, a golem fist, a rainbow rod, a sword that shoots stars, a bow that shoots FIVE ARROWS FOR THE PRICE OF ONE! Guns have many different bullets you could use. Some lock on to enemies, some give you more gold, some poison your enemies. It is virtually insane!!! There is also a ton of armour with unique full set abilities. Full chlorophyte will give me a green gem to shoot at enemies. Meteor Armor will never make my space gun run out of mana!\n\n‚òÖ Mobs ‚òÖ\n\nAnother huge thing Terraria is for. Unlike Minercaft that only has like 15 mobs, say hello to Terraria 235! Zombies, swamp things, slimes, mummies, bone serpents, skeleton snipers, rainbow slimes, wraiths, wyvrens. I mean come on what else do you want! Terraria's mobs also have cool drops. Whether it's a banner, an accessory or a weapon. A lot of them are rare, but toally worth it for your time!\n\n‚òÖ NPC's ‚òÖ\n\nUnlike in Minecraft this game doesn't have people that hum, with squidwards nose. Terraria has an actual money system where you can buy items from actual NPC's that you get to move in to your house. Whether you have 50 silver for a merchant, or killed Plantera for a Cyborg, the NPC's are great!\n\n‚òÖ Rating ‚òÖ\n\nThis game, hands down deserves a 10/10. If someone were to say otherwise they're a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing idiot. The options are limitless in Terraria!\n\nThank you for reading this whole review, or even a part of it! This review is in beta which means once in a while I will come back to and add more content. It would be appreciated if you were to thumbs it up, I mean thumbs it up if you think Terraria is better then Minecraft too! Have a great day~\nP.S. If you have anything to add or suggestions just tell me, I'll be sure to add them!\n~TerrariaCody\n\n\n\n","May 17, 2015","true","315.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","6","7","3","5"

It was only then Terraria was on Sale on steam so i decided to buy it to be kept up to the latest version automatically.\n\nAnywho, Terraria is a game where u go on adventures. Hunt, mine, dig, fish, craft, and build.\nWell, since a lot of people are comparing this to Minecraft, I'm gonna join in the fun!\n\nSome may say that Minecraft and Terraria are similar games but i can say that both are completely different. Having experienced both games, I noticed that Minecraft is much more creative in its mechanical aspect whereas Terraria is more RPG-like.\n\nCREATIVENESSITY\nMinecraft is 3D (Duh) and has a lot of different ways to build a house or an office tower by using all 3 dimensions to fit different designs for every wall.\nTerraria, being 2D, is limited in that structure as you're restricted to foreground and background only.\n\nFIGHTINGLYNESSITY\nMinecraft has limited combat as in its current state only has Swords and Bows. Although the tools can also be used as weapons but they are meant to be tools. The only way to expand this system is by installing mods unless Mojang adds more.\nTerraria consist of 3 different classes in its combat mechanics: Warrior, Ranger and Sorcerer. Warrior being the one with Melee weapons like Shortswords, Longswords, Polearms, Flails and Boomerangs also having the highest defense due to class-based armor. Ranger, one with the Bows, Repeaters and Guns has the highest DPS. Sorcerer is mainly the support class but its the longest lasting class as they have the ability to heal others or themselves if they are equipping the endgame armor.\nNOTE: In Minecraft, there's Enchanting to improve weapons and armor with higher values of damage and resistance respectively. In Terraria, you have prefixes that changes a weapon's stats negatively or positively.\n\nNON-PLAYABLE-CHARACTERSNESSITY\nMinecraft has villagers as NPCs. Consist of a Farmer, Blacksmith, Priest, Librarian and Butcher.\nTerraria has multiple NPCs and are unique in their own way. Consist of the Guide, Nurse, Merchant, Painter, Dye Trader, Demolitionist, Dryad, Arms Dealer, Party Girl, Stylist, Angler, Goblin Tinkerer, Witch Doctor, Clothier, Mechanic, Pirate, Truffle, Steampunker, and Cyborg.\nYou are also able to get Santa himself as an NPC.\nEach and every one of these Terrarian NPCs has a randomly generated list of names.\n\nBOSSNESSITY\nMinecraft has the Ender Dragon and the Wither.\nTerraria has the Eye of Cthulhu, King Slime, Eater of Worlds, Brain of Cthulhu, Queen Bee, Skeletron, Wall of Flesh, The Twins, Destroyer, Skeletron Prime, Plantera, Golem and Duke Fishron. On the console and mobile version of Terraria, there's the Ocram and Lepus.\nThere's more bosses for Terraria but they are Event based.\n\nBIOMENESSITY\nMinecraft has a very very long list of Biomes but they only vary in height and scale like Plains, Mountains, and Oceanic. To summarise the list of biomes: Grasslands, Forests, Jungles, Oceans, Deserts, Savanna, and Mesa. Including some weird looking biomes such as the Nether, Mushroom, and The End.\nTerraria seem to fall short on the variety of biomes as to summarise them: Forest, Desert, Jungle, Corruption, Crimson, Mushroom, Ocean, Hallow, and Space.\n\nThat is about all for my Review although it's more of a comparison.\nI just want to say that Terraria seemed to be longer lasting due to its rich content without mods. However, Minecraft also has much to provide for but falls short when compared out of the creativity aspect.\n\nTo conclude - Get Terraria if you're the type of person who loves APRGs that doesnt have regenerated maps.\nGet Minecraft if you love to travel far and wide to explore undiscovered structures such as the Ocean Monument and/or Desert Pyramids.\n\nI personally recommend Terraria to any sandbox / RPG lovers out there. Seriously, i've spent more than 2 years playing this game and i am not tired of it.\nMy final verdict for Terraria is an 8/10","October 15, 2014","true","250.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

If you aren't good with hard survival games that can be confusing at the beggining if no videos or people tell you anything about it. AND IT IS NOT ANYTHING LIKE MINECRAFT SO STOP SAYING THAT! Here are some tips throughout the game:\nFirst, get wood and make houses so that you and NPCs can live in them. For it to be a valid house, you need to have solid blocks, no  holes in the wall, a table and chair, and a background wall.\nNext, go mining and exploring. Don't forget to bring torches, NIGHT AND CAVES ARE REALLY DARK WITHOUT LIGHT.\nYou may find cool gadgets that you can equip in your inventory, also, you should make some armor.\nNext, fight bosses such as the eye of cthulu and get even better gear.\nYou can go and fight skeletron at the end of the world and have access into the dungeon.\nKeep playing the game and progressing further.\nNext, go to the bottom of the world, make a long, straight, pathway and then throw a guide voodoo doll into lava and fight the wall of flesh.\nYou will now be in hardmode which makes a new biome and every enemy is buffed incredibley.\nI will let you continue from there on your own.

I had heard it was similar to Mindcraft, except it was a side scrolling game. I actually found Terraria to be a lot of fun. You can explore underground tunnels, or create your own. Fight off a variety of monsters, collect treasure chests, harvest vines, trees etc. There are also quest areas where you can go into a dungeon, fight bosses and find exceptional loot. What I liked about this game most was probably how I could play with friends. Co-op play, travelling to different biomes and gathering new resources depending on what biome you are in, makes this game a challenge as well as rewarding. If you enjoyed minecraft, you may find this to your liking as well. The graphics are dumbed down, but it is done that way on purpose and gives the game a special charm. Pick this up if you don't have it in your library, I think you will really enjoy it.","May 27, 2015","true","89.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","9","13","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grapenuts/recommended/105600/","grapenuts","Rusty Hardy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grapenuts/","301 products in account","Wow!\n\nI have had this game in my Steam Library for nearly two years and had only played it once , for about 10 minutes before uninstalling it. I didn't understand how it worked. Plain and simple. Frankly I was spoiled by the flagrantly straightforward nature of Minecraft.  Here recently though, and for no reason whatsoever, other than; I guess, curiosity, and the fact that I‚Äôm burned smooth the heck out on Minecraft, I decided to give it another shot.\n\nFirst, let me say this: I love Minecraft, but seriously, aside from building some random things, some quite cool, and proclaiming, "Look what I made," there isn‚Äôt much to it. You can pretty much see everything there is to see, in a mere five hours of goofing around, if not much less. Terraria, on the other hand, is massive! I am constantly surprised by just how enormous this game is. I‚Äôm actually quite stupefied by this games lack of visibility. After spending some time with it, I can‚Äôt see why anyone would even want to play Minecraft. This game has everything and way, way more. Its just 2D, which is probably a turn off to most and pixel art, BUT, it‚Äôs fluidly animated, with tight, precise controls and runs fantastically on even the most basic system. The particle effects and simple physics, along with plenty of gratifying explosions, colorful dismemberment, -of enemies‚Ä¶.and you- are pleasing enough to allow most people, I would imagine, to get passed their initial deterrents with relative ease.\n\nWhat really grabbed me about this game, wasn't just the overall vastness of the map, but the incredible range of craftable items, armor and weapons. It feels so nice when you get a rare drop or find a new more powerful weapon or accessory, that makes traversing the world easier. It starts out rough and certainly seems mind numbingly basic, but get past that, and you will find that it‚Äôs well worth the time. Just dig deeper, literally, the games best content, by far, is deep below the surface of the world.\n\nMe, I love to explore and find new things. I love getting more powerful weapons and not having to worry about breaking or losing them, due to some stupid, unavoidable event (although there are harder modes which penalize you a bit more ruthlessly; dropping gear, items and even permanent character loss for the Hardcore players). I love going back to places I used to get trounced in and do the trouncing. If I can bring a friend to help, all the better.\n\nThe co-op in Terraria is crazy fun. My girlfriend and I, are enthralled. I Highly recommend this game to couples who, along with knowing how to portforward and research how to run their own servers (it‚Äôs easy) also love exploration and loot quest games. For instance: Do you love Zelda games? Metroid Games? Castlevania, maybe? This is your game and For 10 bucks, you are basically stealing it.\n\nNote: If you get confused on how to start, or what to do in general. If the size of the game overwhelms you, don't worry, there are plenty of immensely entertaining YouTube videos of people playing from start to finish as well superfluous wiki.\n\nHave fun.","October 7, 2014","true","104.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

That right there is an uneducated and ignorant summary of the indie masterpiece which is Terraria. While some of the concepts are alike Minecraft, it is unique in it's RPG elements and wide variety of items which is well over that of Minecraft's amount. With over 1000 different items and blocks, just under 20 NPCs, 100s of enemies and a charming retro artstyle, there is little I can find that disappoints me in this game. Gameplay is relatively simple and even though once you get up to the Frost Moon event you will still find new things to do. On top of that the game is actively being updated; with updates providing players with a hefty amount of new content. Multiplayer is good fun although I prefer the more easygoing experience of singleplayer. Like most games there are large public servers but you can easily make LAN and Private servers with the aid of programs such as LogMeIn Hamachi. Terraria is a relaxing, fun and unique sandbox; don't listen to the naysayers who shun this game because of it's small and irrelevant similarities to Minecraft.","January 16, 2014","true","836.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If you take it for what it attempts to be, it is absolutely a near masterpiece; not on the same level as design paragons such as Team Fortress 2, but, all things considered, there is no game quite like Terraria.\n\nFire and foremost, Terraria's most major strength is how its combat plays out. It's clear that Redigit had one goal in mind when creating this game: To allow the player to have as much fun as possible, limitations and logic disregarded. Every single weapon, armor, and accessory in this game is unique in its own way. Terraria strays from the ever-too-common (and, to be frank, rather boring) path of a linear upgrade of tools based on mining materials and crafting new items from them in a way singular to the genre. With so many various ways of dishing out pain and making your own character hardier, faster, more agile, or more powerful, combined with the ability to switch between any weapon instantaneously, it's no wonder that Terraria's combat is so enjoyable. As a result of these things, we have a game that's fast-paced with a surprisingly high amount of thought and skill able to be invested into it.\nWhen it really comess down to it, though, Terraria's best (and most challenging) combat-related quirk has to be its wonderful bosses. Remember when you first fought the Wall of Flesh? Jumping and flying backwards desperately, avoiding lasers and firing your own as leeches leapt from the ground, practically biting at your feet? THAT... is the type of thing you can expect from Terraria's bosses. It practically plays like an action movie. On a Small world, one could easily cover half or more of the map fighting just a single one of the hardmode bosses, with every little bit of it being intense and action-packed. These guys certainly keep you on your feet, and, if you want to be victorious, you'll have to make the proper preparations... both mental and physical. The bosses are no pushovers.\n\nTerraria's other major strong point is in how the game itself is designed. In fact, one could say that this point in particular has clearly had a lot more thought invested in it from the developers, but, as far as the player is concerned, the combat plays much more into enjoyability. Anyway, if you take a step back and reflect on both the minor and major details... the progression of the game, the extent to which it has been fleshed out... you'll find that there's quite a lot to love. I've garnered quite a bit of respect for the Terraria developers on this notion alone. For example, think about how your character grows and develops; both movement and combat capabilities. You start off the game slow and weak, with little means to maneuver around enemies or caves. As such, you're forced to be careful with how you dig, tackle enemies, and explore the many underground caverns of your world. You won't be able to jump very high, so you have to make do with parkouring blocks or using wood platforms to get back up. Not much later into the game, you'll probably get your first bit of rope. With this new and fascinating tool, your caving has been simplified somewhat, at least vertically; by placing climable ropes, getting in and out of your mine will be much easier and safer.\nTo save explanation time, later, you get things like the Hermes boots, rocket boots, cloud in a bottle, etc., all of which change the way you can move around your world. Not only that, but this ties back into combat as well; changing how the player character can move affects their possible strategies and fighting fitness as well. It results in a strange sort of "progression" based entirely on gear alone that stands out among other types of progression. In terms of how the enemies and environments need to adapt to this, the developers totally accounted for it.\n\nThat's not all, of course. A good example of a small detail would be how the biome and wall backgrounds are designed. The layering and method/style in which they are drawn creates a feeling of 3D-ness in a completely 2D game, which is something to be commended. The one place where this game may be lacking is in replayability, although you could probably make an argument for that, too. Although there are many ways to play through the game, thanks to the sheer number of ways you can acquire useful items and the various distinct areas the game has to offer, a character is certainly a bit of a time investment. Getting to endgame could easily take several days, which is really more a good thing than bad. However, this means that, once the game has revealed all its tricks, there is really no value in playing it through the exact same way twice.\n\nI think I've said enough. Overall, Terraria wins out against its competitors, Minecraft included, by keeping a focused concept and having some of the most amazing game design possible. If you've come for the combat, do it. For $9.99, you can own and play indefinitely one of the greatest games ever made, in my opinion. Don't even wait for a sale; ten dollars isn't a lot. Terraria is more than worth it, and you're only hurting yourself by putting off playing it.","June 3, 2014","true","371.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

I didn't understand how it worked. Plain and simple. Frankly I was spoiled by the flagrantly straightforward nature of Minecraft.  Here recently though, and for no reason whatsoever, other than; I guess, curiosity, and the fact that I‚Äôm burned smooth the heck out on Minecraft, I decided to give it another shot.\n\nFirst, let me say this: I love Minecraft, but seriously, aside from building some random things, some quite cool, and proclaiming, "Look what I made," there isn‚Äôt much to it. You can pretty much see everything there is to see, in a mere five hours of goofing around, if not much less. Terraria, on the other hand, is massive! I am constantly surprised by just how enormous this game is. I‚Äôm actually quite stupefied by this games lack of visibility. After spending some time with it, I can‚Äôt see why anyone would even want to play Minecraft. This game has everything and way, way more. Its just 2D, which is probably a turn off to most and pixel art, BUT, it‚Äôs fluidly animated, with tight, precise controls and runs fantastically on even the most basic system. The particle effects and simple physics, along with plenty of gratifying explosions, colorful dismemberment, -of enemies‚Ä¶.and you- are pleasing enough to allow most people, I would imagine, to get passed their initial deterrents with relative ease.\n\nWhat really grabbed me about this game, wasn't just the overall vastness of the map, but the incredible range of craftable items, armor and weapons. It feels so nice when you get a rare drop or find a new more powerful weapon or accessory, that makes traversing the world easier. It starts out rough and certainly seems mind numbingly basic, but get past that, and you will find that it‚Äôs well worth the time. Just dig deeper, literally, the games best content, by far, is deep below the surface of the world.\n\nMe, I love to explore and find new things. I love getting more powerful weapons and not having to worry about breaking or losing them, due to some stupid, unavoidable event (although there are harder modes which penalize you a bit more ruthlessly; dropping gear, items and even permanent character loss for the Hardcore players). I love going back to places I used to get trounced in and do the trouncing. If I can bring a friend to help, all the better.\n\nThe co-op in Terraria is crazy fun. My girlfriend and I, are enthralled. I Highly recommend this game to couples who, along with knowing how to portforward and research how to run their own servers (it‚Äôs easy) also love exploration and loot quest games. For instance: Do you love Zelda games? Metroid Games? Castlevania, maybe? This is your game and For 10 bucks, you are basically stealing it.\n\nNote: If you get confused on how to start, or what to do in general. If the size of the game overwhelms you, don't worry, there are plenty of immensely entertaining YouTube videos of people playing from start to finish as well superfluous wiki.\n\nHave fun.","October 7, 2014","true","104.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Your first goal is survival. During the first day, you deal with pesky slimes while you gather the materials needed to build a shelter before nightfall. Once night comes, the undead swarm you. Are you resting safely in your new house, or are you forced to fight until daybreak?\n\nIf you thought slimes and undead were all you had to worry about in this world, you were wrong. Outlandish minions and deadly bosses await every turn, as you explore the many different environments in the world. Defeating them will reward you with new materials, weapons, armor, and even trophies to display.\n\nBeware of the corruption, an environment native to Terraria, that slowly spreads, trying to shroud your world in darkness. Or, will your world contain the crimson? A festering landscape, oozing with blood and flesh that constantly tries to devour you. You will not be left defenceless against these horrors, however! You can work to purify the land to its original state.\n\nIn your travels, you will find resources that you can mine and gather. Combine them into powerful weapons and armor, or shape them into building blocks for new structures. As you grow and progress, NPCs will begin to flock to your buildings, offering you aid. You will even find some out in the world, waiting to be rescued.\n\nTunnel through the earth, or take wing and fly to the clouds. Purify or corrupt. Build or destroy.

I have not owned it for long, but I have played enough to know it is  and always will be one of my all time favorite games. A beautiful mix of building, exploration, fighting, and crafting. I would reccomend this game to anyone who craves a game in which there is so much to do and so much to collect. This game will definitely keep you hooked for +1,000 hours. Overall, a 10 dollars well spent.\n\nGameplay: 9/10 -- The gameplay is certainly wide in variety and there is so much to do. I give it a 9 because of grinding, as it isn't my typical favorite. Still amazing, however.\n\nSoundtrack: 10/10 -- Terraria's soundtrack is absolutely amazing. I love every single tune that plays in different biome's (Underground Hallow is my favorite). :-)\n\nBuilding: 10/10 -- With 20 truckloads of different blocks, banners, and furniture, you could build a dragon, inside a chicken, eating a lamb while being trampled by an elephant, so to speak. The building can be simple and complex, depending on one's creativity.\n\nExploration: 8.5/10 -- As amazing as the biomes are in Terraria, the exploration can sometimes get repetative, however, this happens very rarely. Aside from that, the exploration is very exciting if you are a newcomer.\n\nTerraria, in a nutshell, is a game like no other, with plenty to do and heaps of fun.

Terraria is a game that's not like minecraft in many ways, alot of people think it's just minecraft flipped into a 2-d enviornment... It really isn't, and it's alot more complex than minecraft when you first pick it up... On the outside, this looks like a "cutsie" minecraft clone where you chop down trees and such... Then there's the corrupt/crimson caves... This game can be very cutsie, but can be very dark when it wants to... There's so much to remember that you may even need a steam guide to help you through it... Also, you can play this game in many, many different ways, and I'd actually call it a pseudo RPG, you could play as a brewer that can brew up many helpful potions and dangerous poisons, you could play as someone that's a straight up warrior, you can even play as someone that uses only magic... There's so much to love here, and if you haven't played it, I reccomend you pick it up, I've seen it go as low as 2 dollars during the steam sales, so it shouldn't be too hard to get yourself a copy...\n\nThere's also a very very small modding community with this game... The devs aren't as open to modding as minecraft is, but if you want to get into mods I reccoment "Nterraira" it essentially turns the game into a real rpg... I'd almost call it a 2-D skyrim where you build things...\n\nThat's about it, there's alot to see here, and It's 100% worth your time and money to pick up!","May 13, 2015","true","514.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

One of the best sandboxes out there, standing in my rank around Garry's Mod, GTA, Minecraft etc. This game lets youre imagination take over your gameplay, however if it's not your thing, you can also have fun hunting, mining, exploring etc. This game could be a RPG game, alrought it doesn't have any quests or LVL / EXP. But there is one possibility, if you prefer RPG games over normal sandbox game, i prefer the modification called N Terraria, which adds quests, items, classes, EXP, levels and other stuff that's present in RPG's. This game is however one of those games that are like drugs, you try a little bit, then you stay for 5 hours, and you can't really wait until waking up the next day to play it again. It also seems that every game i had cracked (counting Terraria), when i buy it, i have far better luck, also i feel much more reliefed on my soul. So it is good to buy games, even if you have the crack, because it's supporting the developers. Seeing how i go too much off-topic, i must say that you just never know what happens in Terraria. The only thing i lack now is progressively generating world, as Terraria is updated preety frequently and new items come. You don't really need to be really creative to play Terraria, because it is easy to do simple, yet beautiful buildings. For those, who prefer building over exploration, i prefer installing some mods / cheats and building whatever you like. If you didn't play Terraria in your life, i feel very sad for you.","January 5, 2015","true","95.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","2"

It's a game where you need to get used to. It's not like when you start you are instantly used to the controls, it's a bit different that other games. And a clear nope, it's not even a bit like Minecraft. In Terraria you can't get mods, but you can do alot more than in the vanilla Minecraft. You can fight bosses and even get more than just... material? WAY more classic mobs like zombies and stuff, also you can select between classes, of course not where you create a game but when you are in lategame you can select between archer, mage and meele. It won't help you out if you are a mage with archer armor. Anyway, now to the graphics :\nAs you may have noticed, this game looks simliar to Minecraft, since both are pixelated games I need to admit I like the look of Terraria more. What really russles my jimmies in these Reviews are people that compare Minecraft and Terraria.\nAnyways I would say the graphics are good, it would be really disgusting (depends HOW it would be) if it would be 3D and HD. As I said there are boss fight's, more mobs and the thing I like at the most is that there are events & special armor/items. This game is a clear 9.5/10 I guess. Should buy it! By the way, I like playing warrior, archer and then mage in this order, because it gets really hard if you start with the mage. You could really get confused if you would start with mage since there are different weapons and potions.\nThis was the postive thing, still I'm gonna stay at 9.5/10. The negative thing is :\n---","November 29, 2014","true","385.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","4"

Its simple gameplay design, brightly coloured world and the ability to shape an entire village with actual NPCs make it a decent game. What makes it a great game however, is the enormously expansive amount of things there are to be found in Terraria. The lots of bosses, special events every few in-game days and an absolute boatload of items increased Terraria's play-a-bility enormously for me; even after more than 35 hours, I feel that I haven't even seen 10% of the entire game.

If you take it for what it attempts to be, it is absolutely a near masterpiece; not on the same level as design paragons such as Team Fortress 2, but, all things considered, there is no game quite like Terraria.\n\nFire and foremost, Terraria's most major strength is how its combat plays out. It's clear that Redigit had one goal in mind when creating this game: To allow the player to have as much fun as possible, limitations and logic disregarded. Every single weapon, armor, and accessory in this game is unique in its own way. Terraria strays from the ever-too-common (and, to be frank, rather boring) path of a linear upgrade of tools based on mining materials and crafting new items from them in a way singular to the genre. With so many various ways of dishing out pain and making your own character hardier, faster, more agile, or more powerful, combined with the ability to switch between any weapon instantaneously, it's no wonder that Terraria's combat is so enjoyable. As a result of these things, we have a game that's fast-paced with a surprisingly high amount of thought and skill able to be invested into it.\nWhen it really comess down to it, though, Terraria's best (and most challenging) combat-related quirk has to be its wonderful bosses. Remember when you first fought the Wall of Flesh? Jumping and flying backwards desperately, avoiding lasers and firing your own as leeches leapt from the ground, practically biting at your feet? THAT... is the type of thing you can expect from Terraria's bosses. It practically plays like an action movie. On a Small world, one could easily cover half or more of the map fighting just a single one of the hardmode bosses, with every little bit of it being intense and action-packed. These guys certainly keep you on your feet, and, if you want to be victorious, you'll have to make the proper preparations... both mental and physical. The bosses are no pushovers.\n\nTerraria's other major strong point is in how the game itself is designed. In fact, one could say that this point in particular has clearly had a lot more thought invested in it from the developers, but, as far as the player is concerned, the combat plays much more into enjoyability. Anyway, if you take a step back and reflect on both the minor and major details... the progression of the game, the extent to which it has been fleshed out... you'll find that there's quite a lot to love. I've garnered quite a bit of respect for the Terraria developers on this notion alone. For example, think about how your character grows and develops; both movement and combat capabilities. You start off the game slow and weak, with little means to maneuver around enemies or caves. As such, you're forced to be careful with how you dig, tackle enemies, and explore the many underground caverns of your world. You won't be able to jump very high, so you have to make do with parkouring blocks or using wood platforms to get back up. Not much later into the game, you'll probably get your first bit of rope. With this new and fascinating tool, your caving has been simplified somewhat, at least vertically; by placing climable ropes, getting in and out of your mine will be much easier and safer.\nTo save explanation time, later, you get things like the Hermes boots, rocket boots, cloud in a bottle, etc., all of which change the way you can move around your world. Not only that, but this ties back into combat as well; changing how the player character can move affects their possible strategies and fighting fitness as well. It results in a strange sort of "progression" based entirely on gear alone that stands out among other types of progression. In terms of how the enemies and environments need to adapt to this, the developers totally accounted for it.\n\nThat's not all, of course. A good example of a small detail would be how the biome and wall backgrounds are designed. The layering and method/style in which they are drawn creates a feeling of 3D-ness in a completely 2D game, which is something to be commended. The one place where this game may be lacking is in replayability, although you could probably make an argument for that, too. Although there are many ways to play through the game, thanks to the sheer number of ways you can acquire useful items and the various distinct areas the game has to offer, a character is certainly a bit of a time investment. Getting to endgame could easily take several days, which is really more a good thing than bad. However, this means that, once the game has revealed all its tricks, there is really no value in playing it through the exact same way twice.\n\nI think I've said enough. Overall, Terraria wins out against its competitors, Minecraft included, by keeping a focused concept and having some of the most amazing game design possible. If you've come for the combat, do it. For $9.99, you can own and play indefinitely one of the greatest games ever made, in my opinion. Don't even wait for a sale; ten dollars isn't a lot. Terraria is more than worth it, and you're only hurting yourself by putting off playing it.","June 3, 2014","true","371.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tbotbg/recommended/105600/","tbotbg","BlueWolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tbotbg/","94 products in account","Terraria starts like a less satisfying version of Minecraft, squashed into a 2D platformer. It ends as a terrific exploration game, packed with places to discover. Floating islands, festering Corrupted Lands and huge multi-level dungeons guarded by boss monsters are just a few things you can unearth once you‚Äôve crafted yourself a pair of pants sturdy enough to survive this world.\n\nBuilding and crafting in Terraria is simple once you know how, but the only help you get upon jumping into your procedurally generated world is a few cryptic hints from a guide NPC. It took persistence and a lot of help from a wiki before I figured it out. Clicking on any block in the world will smash it and deposit it in your inventory, where mined substances can be combined to form increasingly insane items that you can equip, or use to improve your hand-built home. Standing near a furnace or an anvil opens up more crafting options. If you‚Äôve got the right gear, you‚Äôll eventually be able to craft grappling hooks, jet boots and phase swords (lightsabers!).\n\nNow I have a golden broadsword, a ring of health regeneration, metal pants and my very own palace. I flaunt my new copper trousers at the floating eyeball that‚Äôs attacking me. I‚Äôve come a long way since my first night, spent madly whirling a pickaxe around my head to fend off waves of zombies.\n\nTo find the materials and items to build these things, you‚Äôre going to have to go travelling, which is where Terraria really shines. Tunnelling into a vast and intimidating cavern for the first time was horrible. How nervously I threw a torch over the edge to find out what new creature was emitting the awful growling noise that had made me tarnish my copper trousers. Then there was the time I found that underground jungle full of nether-hornets, or the giant mushroom forest guarded by a Mother Slime. It feels like there‚Äôs no end of new areas to discover.\n\nTheoretically you can turn your world into a server and invite as many friends as your connection can handle, but currently the netcode is extremely buggy. One of the regular patches could clean this up, but for now most players resort to using hacks such as Hamachi (a shareware virtual private network) as a workaround, which is not a surefire solution. For the short time I had it working, the multiplayer was more chaotic, faster and more exciting than playing alone.\n\nCombat is haphazard, too. There‚Äôs little strategy beyond madly waving your weapon at your foes. The warrior with the best sword wins.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt mind this, and are happy to go online for crafting recipes, then Terraria offers dozens and dozens of hours of rewarding exploration. The lack of in-game tutorial and the slow start are drawbacks, but at only $10, Terraria is a steal for those with the patience to reach its deepest caverns.","January 11, 2014","true","14.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","6"

It promotes playing as a community only to ruin friendships and create bitter divides that will last lifetimes.\n\nTerraria is a game which on the surface seems benign and creative, however hides a darker secret underneath it's cute and lovable exterior.\n\nA modern day Tower of Babel, Terraria takes a community of individuals who understand each other and work together for something amazing, only for them to fall apart in complete distrust and violence. Similarly to Sodom and Gomorrah anyone who looks back at their time with multiplayer Terraria turns into a pillar of salt.\n\nIt is easy to see that Terraria is filled with selfish depravity. As we watch friends turn on each other like animals over a Magic Mirror and houses destroyed with an 'accidental dynamite', one can only imagine what horrible purgatory this world would be if Terraria was any closer to the real world.\n\nTerraria is like Pandora's Box. It seems benign and harmless, even pretty. However even the Eater of Worlds, Eye of Cthulhu and Wall of Flesh pale in comparison to the darkness that blossoms in each Terraria player's heart. Save yourselves. Don't open that box.","September 2, 2014","true","202.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

It's a game where you need to get used to. It's not like when you start you are instantly used to the controls, it's a bit different that other games. And a clear nope, it's not even a bit like Minecraft. In Terraria you can't get mods, but you can do alot more than in the vanilla Minecraft. You can fight bosses and even get more than just... material? WAY more classic mobs like zombies and stuff, also you can select between classes, of course not where you create a game but when you are in lategame you can select between archer, mage and meele. It won't help you out if you are a mage with archer armor. Anyway, now to the graphics :\nAs you may have noticed, this game looks simliar to Minecraft, since both are pixelated games I need to admit I like the look of Terraria more. What really russles my jimmies in these Reviews are people that compare Minecraft and Terraria.\nAnyways I would say the graphics are good, it would be really disgusting (depends HOW it would be) if it would be 3D and HD. As I said there are boss fight's, more mobs and the thing I like at the most is that there are events & special armor/items. This game is a clear 9.5/10 I guess. Should buy it! By the way, I like playing warrior, archer and then mage in this order, because it gets really hard if you start with the mage. You could really get confused if you would start with mage since there are different weapons and potions.\nThis was the postive thing, still I'm gonna stay at 9.5/10. The negative thing is :\n---","November 29, 2014","true","385.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","4"

It's a great time sink. (Don't know whether that's a good thing, but I just don't notice the hours going by when having fun.)\n\nI'm not much for action, but I like building, at my own pace. Here I can build, and when I want to do something else, go whack a zombie over the head. Or throw foul eggs at the Idiot (aka Guide) when he opens the door and lets the zombies in at night. Or go on a (non-capital q) quest to find stuff to make better equipment.\n\nEven progression is at my pace. I can go beat up the next tougher boss, or not. Or ask a friend to host a new world where he and other friends help beat up a really tough boss that makes stuff available that I can then drag home to my peaceful world to continue building.\n\nI'm really into doing it my way, doing what I want, when I want, and this game lets me.","November 18, 2013","true","529.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aiur122/recommended/105600/","aiur122","CJ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aiur122/","195 products in account","This game is just amazing. One of the best sandboxes out there, standing in my rank around Garry's Mod, GTA, Minecraft etc. This game lets youre imagination take over your gameplay, however if it's not your thing, you can also have fun hunting, mining, exploring etc. This game could be a RPG game, alrought it doesn't have any quests or LVL / EXP. But there is one possibility, if you prefer RPG games over normal sandbox game, i prefer the modification called N Terraria, which adds quests, items, classes, EXP, levels and other stuff that's present in RPG's. This game is however one of those games that are like drugs, you try a little bit, then you stay for 5 hours, and you can't really wait until waking up the next day to play it again. It also seems that every game i had cracked (counting Terraria), when i buy it, i have far better luck, also i feel much more reliefed on my soul. So it is good to buy games, even if you have the crack, because it's supporting the developers. Seeing how i go too much off-topic, i must say that you just never know what happens in Terraria. The only thing i lack now is progressively generating world, as Terraria is updated preety frequently and new items come. You don't really need to be really creative to play Terraria, because it is easy to do simple, yet beautiful buildings. For those, who prefer building over exploration, i prefer installing some mods / cheats and building whatever you like. If you didn't play Terraria in your life, i feel very sad for you.","January 5, 2015","true","95.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sauspls/recommended/105600/","sauspls","saus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sauspls/","41 products in account","On the surface, Terraria looks like a "2D version of Minecraft". However, once you immerse yourself into its gameplay, and start to discover more about the world you live in, Terraria has so much more depth and variety than meets the eye.\n\nFor starters, just look at the armour and combat system. Most armour sets give their own specific set bonuses, and once hardmode is unlocked, each hardmode armour set allows you to choose between 3 different playstyles, melee, ranged and magic. Also, the 3 "endgame" armour sets (Beetle, Spectre and Shroomite) allow you to receive either a defense bonus, increased sustainability or just the ability to deal more damage with a projectile type of your choice.\n\nMoving on to the weapons, there is a lot of variety when it comes to weapon choice. For melee weapon users, you have the choice of using a lance, shortsword, broadsword or melee weapons that shoot shards of ice or summon pumpkin heads to chase after your enemies and destroy them. Ranged weapon users get to choose between the bow and arrow, guns or rocket launchers (proximity mines included). Magic weapon users can alternate between a variety of spells, ranging from a sphere that autoattacks enemies for a couple of seconds to a shower of ichor that makes enemies appear as if you've just ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• on them.\n\nThat's just the combat system. Each world in Terraria is unique, randomly generated and has resources that you may be unable to obtain by playing on another world. Terraria encourages the creation of multiple worlds in order for one to explore more land, and discover how each world is different. Some worlds may have giant trees while others may have pyramids partially buried in the ground.\n\nThere are also so many blocks for one to experiment and build with in Terraria. Ranging from rainbow blocks that change colour rapidly to asphalt blocks that allows you to run faster, Terraria allows for each person to showcase their own build style through the insane amount of blocks in the game. Not to mention the number of decorative items in the game, such as banners, tiki torches and chinese lanterns. Almost everything can be created in the 2-dimensional world of Terraria, where the only restriction is how many of the block you need, and the size of your build.\n\nWires also allow for electronic and automatic contraptions to be built, from arenas of death to a teleporter system that works like a railway system. Electronic devices can also be used to produce infinite amounts of liquid, or drain an ocean just because you can. Actuators allow bases to be extremely well hidden, crops to be harvested at the flick of a switch and a door to open for you once you approach it, adding a lot more complexity to the electronic devices in Terraria.\n\nMultiplayer just makes Terraria so much more fun. By allowing friends to connect to your Terraria server, some armour set bonuses really shine, such as the reduced chance for mobs to target you, or just the ability to heal your allies by dealing out damage to mobs. Caving is so much more fun with more than one person, where it would normally be so grind-ish and boring. Boss fights become so much more interesting with players taking turns to lure the boss and distract it while others happily fire away at the boss with their weapons.\n\nAltogether, all these factors combined is why Terraria is so fun and addictive. Once you enter the world of Terraria, there is so much to discover and build that you just can't put it down. Overall, Terraria is definitely worth the money, and is a solid purchase for everyone who buys the game. 9/10.\n","March 16, 2014","true","410.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
