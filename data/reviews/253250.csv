Usually the problems are solved with a reboot of the game due to errors while the game engine is still in developement.\n\nI have almost 900 hours on this game. Already for more fun than most AAA titles with far better replayability. Obviously it's an alpha so there are bugs but I've never seen a company so dedicated to getting the bugs squished as quickly as possible. I really can't give this game a high enough rating and it just continues to get better with every release. It is already well worth the money and it's a game that every member of the family can play.\n\nEdit: apparently my review was suspiciously positive and didn't contain enough...something. So, for the people who are suspicious of positive reviews (seriously?) Here's your version:\n\n"Ths gam r grate. I ply this game lots and lots. Yay!

The game is becoming more polished and seems to be headed in a positive direction. I would recommend this to someone who enjoys a sandbox building and crafting games where they can design towns and villages with a little bit of hostile goblins thrown in to the mix.\n\nI do not recommend this yet for someone that is expecting a finished polished product or get upset when an error message pops up.\n\nThe Good\n- I find the game extremely fun to play with the ability to design your own houses and structures.\n- The pace of the game is relaxing and the music is very soothing.\n- The Heathing are amusing as they try to carry out your commands\n- There are more creatures to worry about now as Giant Zombie, Stone Golems, Eants, and what looks like a mutant alligator roam the land. Undead Villages complete with crazed necromancers pop up and flood the night with undead critters.\n- The ability to create Mods will mean continued content. I hope that this also continues to develop end game content.\n- Weekly twitch feed keep you updated on developments and lets you give feed back to the developers.\n\nThe Bad\n- There are still errors when trying to build structures, and it takes a while to learn what works and what does not. It seems the building logic really wants you to lay down your design in a certain way. I watched a twitch feed were the designer was working on this to allow the engine to be more flexible.\n- The Hearthling become idler as your town, village, Kingdom expands. I am unsure if this is caused by distance, memory issues or pathing (although sometime it’s because I ran out of wood). The developers have work hard and these issues have improved greatly since I started playing it. (I still have to chop my own wood of course)\n- The end game is not there yet.  There is a basic scenario evolving Blood thirsty goblins which ends after 4 or 5 encounters.  Following that you only have to fend off random creatures once or twice a day.\n\nI will continue to play and follow this game as it develops.\n","January 31","true","689.8"," 119 of 125 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","119","125","6","1"

DUDE. Look at this.\nIt's an Early Access game... and they're WORKING ON IT.\n\nI've been playing Stonehearth on and off for a while, the interest spikes obviously coinciding with updates, and I am glad to say this game does not have potential. It has promise. Because a promise is something you actually follow through on.\n\nLike everyone else is saying, it is by no means complete. Think about it: it's a sandbox game and they only just put the zombies and water in. How complete is that to you?\n\nBut it all works, more or less. More THAN less. There are peculiarities, certainly - when I tell you tiny voxel people to pick berries, I mean I want you to TAKE those berries back to town - but it doesn't hiccup too often. And there have been some interesting hiccups. The biggest one, which involved two separate timers ingame and their misbehavior, the devs actually detailed in a blog post.\n\nWhich brings me to the dev team, Radiant. These people talk with their community, and their community talks back. And they communicate often. Weekly - or so, ♥♥♥♥ happens - posts keep everyone appraised of what's going on with/in to the game, which is always nice to see. And I've seen some ♥♥♥♥, man... I purchased Cube World.\n\nNow, I want to draw attention to something that I think is important. Stonehearth is currently in Alpha 10 - every time there's a large content update, they bump that number up by one. And it's only just now on Early Access, despite it going up on Steam early so Kickstarter patrons would have an easier time of it.\nThat means they waited until they had a significant amount of content in the game before going Early Access.\n\nSeriously, Radiant. Y'all're beautiful.\n\nIf you like boxy sandboxes and RTS-type games, give this one a whirl. I think you'll like it.","June 5, 2015","true","246.2"," 152 of 169 people (90%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","90","152","169","35","0"

It's a merge of Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft; The former for it's 'base-building' and management aspects, the latter for it's voxel graphics.\n\nTL;DR Pros/Cons list:\n+ Good replay value\n+ Looks great\n+ Large amount of craftable items and professions\n+ Building Designer\n+ Villagers level up and unlock skills\n+ Frequently updated\n\n- Rather buggy, villagers tend to get confused very often and so on\n- Combat is slow and iffy at times\n- Game will often break if you don't save often to avoid doing things that break it\n- Some 'texture' issues\n- Few pre-built structures\n- Lack of game customisation (monster spawn rates, villagers, etc)\n\nIn Stonehearth, your goal (if any) is rather simple: to build a thriving medieval village/city, and take care of the various needs of your villagers (known has hearthlings) along the way.\nYou don't have direct control over your villagers like an RTS; you give them orders to perform and they'll find a way to do it (most of the time) themselves.\n\nAs you progress in-game, and your villagers level up, you'll slowly unlock more proffessions for them to practice, and thus more furniture, decoration, tools and weapons for them to use.\nYou will not, however, unlock new buildings, as the game only has 5 (I believe) pre-built ones. The rest is up to you to build, using the game's Building Designer feature, which works more or less the same as 'The Sims' Build Mode, with a tab bit less freedom.\nHearthlings tend to have issues when building; I have had to help them off of roofs, demolish a building because they couldn't build scaffolding or because they just go on strike and won't build anything at all.\nBe sure to leave at least a block of space around a building when planning it out; your hearthlings won't be able to build the scaffolding if not.\n\nDecoration-wise, there are tons to choose from, ranging from beds, to flower pots or braziers. Each crafting profession has some form of decoration. My villages have gotten prettier and prettier over time as I've discovered new crafts.\n\nThe game's replay value is rather high, as attempting to create a functional village in different environments can be a challenge at times (on top of a mountain, for example ^^).\n\nThe game is also rather buggy in it's current state; several times I have had to start a new game because I placed a path over another and the villagers refused to build anything else, or because I was planning a custom building and none of my orders would work anymore.\nMany blocks/items sometimes overlay eachother as well, causing flickering textures which can get rather irritating at times.\nI've also had issues where my one fighter hearthling has gotten themselves stuck in an infinite loop of 'Attack Golbing Chieftan > Run away from Goblin Chieftan'. Seeing as there is no direct control over the villagers, I can't do anything to get them to stop, and just have to wait for something to hopefully kill them.\n\nAll in all, Stonehearth is a great game to own if you're into the genre and I highly recommend it.The frequent updates make it a great game to come back to from time to time.\nIf I were to rate it out of 10 like everyone else seems to, I'd have to give it the following:\n\n7/10.\nFor an Early Acces game, it has a good amount of content, looks good, is fun to play, but the bugs it has in it's current state sometimes ruin the experience.","June 13, 2015","true","9.6"," 103 of 111 people (93%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","93","103","111","7","5"

I mean if you're into expanding and creating towns and furnishing the houses with the prettiest of flowers, you'll love it, but if you're like me with just striving to hit the top of the research chain/skill tree, it's a bit easy. I'd say you could compare this a little bit to Banished in some several yet different ways.\n\nPros:\n-Easy to learn\n-Visually nice\n-Can design your own buildings\n-Nice mix of city builder/management\n-Some slightly unique concepts\n-Is playable in it's current state\n-Slow progression, but actually being updated\n\nCons:\n-Bugs, lots of 'em.\n-Crashing is frequent (Until you update your drivers)\n-Occasionally slightly broken UI (F5 to fix)\n-Not fully complete job tree (yet)\n-Weird inventory viewing system\n\nAll in all, I would reccomend this game. I did find it enjoyable for the 2 hours I played, but until more is added, I'll just wait patiently.

I first got hooked when it was a concept from someone that seemed to have a passion for what he wanted to do and what he wanted to make.\n\nThis game is the type of early Access that steam needs. More developers should actually follow this style. Here we have a guy that had his game available while in developement with it hardly being playable. We had the chance to see the game receive slow but steady streams of content flowing in and bug squashing. I used to not be able to get 5 minutes before everyone decided they wanted to sit around and do nothing. But unlike other developers, This guy actually kept at it. and unlike other developers. When the cash flowed in... they slowed down, He sped up.\n\nThe closest relation i can give this developer style is like Dwarf Fortress. Not in terms of gameplay, but how he steadily adds content while fixing issues with the game. and any dwarf loving fan will know that it takes a while for each of the updates to come out.\n\nTL:DR - Developer set realistic goals to meet with limited resources.

Steam Early Access! I couldn't be happier for Team Radiant! :)\n\nDisclaimer: I am an official fanboy, and hold this development studio in the highest esteem. But in my defense, I think this is perfectly justified given how open and transparent this team is with their fans and supporters.\n\nAll that aside, what do I actually think about Stonehearth? I think it has the potential to be one of the most entertaining games we've seen in these combined genres in ages. There's a wealth of things that the team has already implemented (building!, classes, crafting, mining, combat) and a whole host of others in the works.\n\nWith each new update the team trickles out improvements to the game's foundation (better performance, more stability) and introduces new mechanics and content as well for the community to test drive. You will be hard pressed to find another team that is as open with their backers as these folks, and its always rewarding to see topics discussed with the team in their bi-weekly stream actually implemented in the game.\n\nI think I'll leave this review for now, and revisit as each new major release is dropped (roughly every month to month and a half). If you are at all interested in the title, I highly encourage to drop by the Discourse and mingle with some other fans and backers.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/redinjun/recommended/253250/","redinjun","Devlosirrus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/redinjun/","366 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBefore I begin, let me say this:  I understand Stonehearth is in Early Access.  I don't expect everything to work flawlessly. That having been said, the game needs a lot of work.\n\nI picked up Stonehearth based on a lot of Steam user reviews comparing it to Dwarf Fortress.  I like Dwarf Fortress, even though the game is notorious for its extremely obfuscated interface.  Stonehearth sacrifices a lot of DF's detailed simulation for a more accessible experience, which is fine with me.  However, as of March 2016, the current build is badly broken.\n\nA few of the weird AI glitches I've seen include Hearthlings that join the settlement, but idle in one place permanently.  After accepting a new Hearthling (hereafter referred to as "plebs"), I watched her stand on a hill for a week, regardless of any orders I issued.  She was eventually eaten by wolves.  Footmen, Stonehearth's 'soldier' class, will charge after enemies they have no chance of defeating, regardless of their current orders.  When they're reduced to 1/4 health, they flee for a few moments, then turn back and resume fighting.  I've lost at least four Footmen because of this behavior.  Mobs also have a tendency to spawn in weird locations, like at the end of a long tunnel with only one entrance.  I got a notification informing me that one of my plebs was mauled to death by wolves, at the end of a mining tunnel with a closed door at the entrance.  Either something's up with the spawning algorithm, or all dogs don't go to heaven.\n\nI'm saying they're ghost dogs.  Way of the samurai.\n\nThe building system is suprisingly robust.  The interface makes it easy to plot foundations, walls, upper floors, and roofs.  I actually designed some pretty handsome structures, and the process was fairly intuitive and straightforward.  However, once I actually placed my blueprint and ordered my plebs to build the structure, I ran into more AI issues.  On two separate occasions, my plebs stopped building before the structure was complete.  They'd build to around 3/4 completion, then idle, as though they had nothing to do.  Reloading the game did nothing.  Suspending all jobs, then re-assigning them did nothing.  I simply had a partially-finished shell of a building in the middle of my settlement.  I tried to remove it, but my plebs demolished about half of the building, then idled again.  My town looks like Detroit in 1996.  Shameful display.\n\nDespite all the AI issues, I still like the game.  The art style is charming, and the UI makes it easy to place buildings and command your plebs.  Once they iron out the issues with plebs abandoning construction halfway through, I think it's going to be a joy to play.  The interface handles walls and roofs very gracefully, and building blueprints for structures is a breeze.  I remember placing roofs in "Towns," a similar town-building game, was a living nightmare.  Most importantly, while scanning the forums for solutions to my AI issues, I saw that the devs were very active, involved with, and respectful to their players.  That's a very good sign.\n\nFor the time being, I'm going to recommend this game.  I was excited enough about the premise that I didn't mind the $25 price tag, but if cost is an issue for you, I'd recommend holding off until they get a beta build up and running.  Bottom line:  despite some pretty rampant AI issues, the game shows a lot of promise.  As long as the devs stay active and listen to their player base, I think this is going to mature into a very enjoyable experience.\n\n[UPDATE 3/13/16]  All of my footmen got thwomped by a one-two combo of ghost dogs and giant zombies, so I decided to start a new settlement in sandbox mode.  So far, I've experienced none of the AI glitches I saw in 'normal' mode.  It seems that something about combat, or placing my settlement on defense mode, breaks the AI.  I'm hoping the devs fix this, because I enjoyed the challenge of defending against sporadic attacks from invaders and thieves.  For the time being, however, I'd recommend you play in sandbox mode.","March 12","true","23.2"," 58 of 61 people (95%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","95","58","61","10","3"

As time goes and and your life has drained away you will have walls up with footman patrolling keeping those pesky goblins and undead in check. Your village will be growing, your workers mining and working, your craftman crafting and your village having life. Quite a site to see.\n\nIf your not into building villages, You can always go to peacful mode and build what you want.

The gameplay is similar to a strategy game, as you do not control directly any character. You just give orders and expect them to be followed. You start with 7 Settlers, each having their own sets of strenghts & weaknesses. One may be thriving in handcrafting while another is suited for military missions. With these settlers, you'll build and develop a camp thanks to all the resources available. These resources are various, and it can be compared here with Terraria for instance.\n\nTo grow, you'll focus on developing the skills of your settlers, assigning them jobs, and gathering as much resources as possible. But these objectives can be endangered by the presence of enemies at night: zombies, skeletons, goblins.

If you think a complex city building and management game is a clone of Minecraft, you need to really get a reality check, bud.\n\nAnyway, moving on to the actual review. First, you should know that I've been playing Stonehearth since the pre-alpha days, and that this review is for Alpha 10.5. I'm also basing this only on the content that is currently available, and not promised stuff due out later in development. Though, I'm personally looking forward to PvP combat, which is going to be a feature later on.\n\nSOUND\nSound design is average, and everything you'd expect to be there, is there. You've got grunts, a catchy (if not a tad repetitive) soundtrack, and all the other standard musical cues you'd expect from a video game.\n-7/10\n\nGAMEPLAY\nYou've got the foundations of a pretty awesome city building game, though there's a clear lack of content as of this writing. The core city building aspect is most definitely there, and you're able to build custom structures, mine for resources, and even fight invading monsters. I've yet to actually figure out what happens if you lose all of your guys to a city invasion, and the enemies don't seem to do much other than invade, and rush you with numbers. But at the very least, it's the start of something major. You're also able to create squads to better fend off enemy invasion, and the city building animations are fascinating. I found myself building random structures just to see how my little minions (yes, that's what I call them) would construct it.\n-9/10\n\nFEATURES\nUnfortunately, the game is currently lacking in the feature department. While the actual gameplay is polished beyond what you'd expect for an Early Access game, it isn't without its faults. For starters, there is very little in the way of configuration. There's no graphic slider, or volume control. This is really just a core experience right now, and you know what? I'm oddly okay with that. This is just an alpha after all. Things will improve.\n-8/10\n\nCONCLUSION\nAll in all, Stonehearth offers a very solid city building experience. Considering as how this is only just in alpha, Stonehearth feels like a finished product. It has polish, it has style. It's just an all around fun experience. Sure, there's a fair number of bugs, though none of them are game breaking, at least in my testing. This is an alpha, so a bug or two is expected. But the fact that Stonehearth plays and feels like a finished product? Well, that's just darn amazing.\n\nSo yes, I recommend Stonehearth.\n\n\nFinal rating?\n8.5/10.\n\n(note: this review was for alpha version 10.5)","June 8, 2015","true","12.9"," 73 of 89 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","73","89","7","11"

Want to support a developer who is upfront about the struggle, needs the communities help, and is rewarding that community with continued work?  Well, this is the game.

This game means quite a bit to me it really got me back into gaming which I was very apathetic about all newer game titles. I've been in the testing phases of this game for a long time pretty much as soon as they allowed you to buy in from their website and I honestly have never regretted it.\n\nThe game itself is quirky. There is a lot of stuff going on and bugs happen, but I can absolutely assure anyone who is put off by this that it will be fixed. In the older builds there were major funny, and breaking bugs.. which messed up the gameplay but the devise are always diligent to squash anything they can as promptly as possible.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough simply because it has such an amazing community. It already has modders, the devs are very active and as transparent as possible, biweekly dev streams where people in chat can actually influence the shape of the game, devs are very appreciative of their community and open to suggestions, and much more. The team definitely has a vision of where this game is going, and they are honestly working their asses off to achieve it.. And so far they are hitting the nail on the head every time. Their over all may not be exactly what I was wanting... But the modding scene well have us covered on that front.\n\nNew builds come out every few weeks.. Sometimes they are buggy sometimes they are not. It all depends on what what changed or how much new content is thrown it. Fixes usually come within a few days but sometimes require a larger update to fix. I pretty much play this game for 5 or 10 hours every other weekend testing the new content, trying out new ideas, etc.. The content is steadily growing at decent rate.\n\nOverall for me this game scratches an itch I've had since finally abandoning dwarf fortress.

It is still in development, but the developers are extremely engaged and regularly release updates with bug fixes, new content, etc. The core of the game is solid and offers significant room for customization of the buildings within your town. At present, there are bugs, but this is expected. What is promising is that many of the bugs I have observed over the course of the past 6 months, have been taken care of. Do new bugs pop up when new content is released? Of course. However, they are typically resolved within a month, at most, of the new content's release.\n\nThe game itself is primarily a city builder with random raids of goblins, undead, etc thrown in to keep the game play interesting and varied. The combat system is a bit wonky at present, but has been steadily improving over time which is a good indication of future improvements to come.\n\nResource gathering has become rather staightforward and it is relatively easy to keep your villagers gathering what you want them to. It does require a bit of micromanagement as there is not a way to automate their gathering behavior at present (e.g. mine when copper is below 20 in storage, gather wood when inventory is below 15, etc). Once the resources are gathered, though, the tradesmen can be completely automated to maintain inventory levels of the items you wish to produce (e.g. set the Blacksmith to maintain 5 swords in inventory, etc)\n\nIn sum, despite the bugs that I have experienced and room for future improvement, I would highly recommend this game. It has vast potential, a very active development team that is engaged with the community, and is generally enjoyable to play.","May 7","true","31.5"," 47 of 52 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","47","52","0","0"

Stonehearth is a sandboxish city builder, simulation game with added rpg like elements. Whether you just want to build your dream village, fight off incoming invaders, or dig the deepest mine, this game has it all. Designing buildings has never been easier and allows for many possibilties and custimizations and your hearthlings will automatically build what you design for them. The profession system gives you various choices to decide which directions you want your little town.\n\nRadiant Entertainment are some of the most community driven developers I have ever come across. They are constantly livestreaming the game development and intereacting with the community on the forums. As this game  has a tendency of having some (often hilarious) bugs here and there as any Alpha game does, the team is very quick at releasing patch versions to adress these kind of errors.\n\nModding is another core component in this game. Being new to moding myself, it is amazing to see how easy it is to mod the game, even in this early state, and should get much easier as the game develops. There is already a nice variety of community made mods available on the stonehearth forums.\n\nAll in all I definitly recomend this to anyone who loves city builders, rpgs and sandbox games.  If you are a hardcore Dwarf Fortress gamer, I suggest you give Stonehearth a try. With the progress Radiant has made so far, I am definitly excited to see what they have in store for multiplayer and the other features they want to add to this wonderful game!\n\n~Avairian","June 3, 2015","true","223.2"," 45 of 49 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","45","49","3","3"

Solid core game aspects, and random generated Quests and Map. It still is missing quite a lot of the bulk stuff.\n\nWhat in my opinion they need to do is:\n\nAdd more jobs.* (like 5-6 more) *note: I did read the roadmap content.\nFix the combat system.* UI restrictions - Orders to Guard(and eat while guarding), Patrol routes, Sentry zones.\nFix the lighting.* Make it so spans farther on fire braziers and other forms of light.\nFix some of the sound skips.*\nMore building material/items to craft.*\nMore drops from mobs.* Also more rare items.\nAdding a more permanent way to buy/sell goods* Like sending caravans and stuff.\nBeing able to use the gold for something.* Right now I have like 12k gold and nothing to spend it on.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who likes building towns but not for those who build in like Minecraft.

But i've had so much fun with it i cant give it a "thumbs down" either.\n\nIts a colony building game in the same vein as Dwarf Fortress or Gnomoria. You designate the little people to be farmers or blacksmiths or whatever, designate a building here and a building there and, whenever they get around to it, they'll build it & live in it. Some of the fun details are that while the game has prefab buildings, you dont have to use them, you can opt to design your own instead. And if you come up with a good design you can save it to use again later. Eventually you'll be able to share your designs & others can use them in their colonies, which will be cool, but its not in yet.\n\nTheres a lot thats not in yet, if you read the design goals, the devs have a LOT in mind for this game. I'll be amazed if they can do half of it. But they keep working on it very steadily. Ive been following it for a long while now & updates & new features have always come in on a regular basis. The devs are very connected to the player community & it shows. Its certainly not another one of those "grab the money & run" fly-by-nights we've seen so many times on early access. These guys are serious about wanting to make a good game.\n\nIf you like to use early access games to observe the game development process, this is a great game for that right now.  If you want it to, the game is happy to show you the nuts & bolts of exactly whats going wrong inside the AI's little brain when it gets stuck on a lamp post or whatever. And if you post a bug report, the devs will almost certainly have a fix in the next patch.\n\nHowever if youre the type who gets upset when you find yourself beta testing a game you paid for, perhaps skip this one for now... but keep an eye open for it, if/when it goes gold its gonna be really good!","August 23, 2015","true","39.3"," 41 of 47 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","41","47","0","1"

The goblin raids that went through your little village when you were nothing but a small team of builders trying to build up their first mess hall and houses for your people. How you were so helpless then and then near you complete your village and are happy with it you are very proud of it. The amount of time you spend and how much love and care you spent with each little villager with the classes and how you can see them work hard on any new structure you build from scratch.\nThe game is beautiful for a voxel game with the cell shading and voxel enviroment.

As a citybuilder/manegment game Stonehearth shows great promise and while it's a bit thin in its currect state (Alpha, so missing a lot of features/content) it's still pretty competent overall. Oddly, my favorite feature isn't the game itself, but the team behind it; Radiant. Those dudes have some of the best community outreach in the business and they are always putting out dev blog updates, keeping the content comming at a pretty good clip and letting you know what's on the horizon when they can't do that. It's cute, it's chirpy, it's got the foundation for a truly great town manager. I particularly love the ability to build custom buildings with relative ease, though style options are slightly limited, what with still being in development.\n\nThere are a few Cons though; one, it's a slow game. Incredibly slow. Pace is apparently something on their list to work on, but as it is, I can only bear to play on fast and even then I feel like there should be a faster setting. There also aren't really any options for stockpile flow--the ability to have a particular stockpile pull from others, and it's one of the major things that's keeping Stonehearth from being truly great. This is also impacted by the speed (since your hearthlings have to walk AAAAALLL THE WAY to the stockpile, then ALLLL THE WAY back) which becomes more problematic as your town gets bigger.\n\nI imagine some of the problems I have will get resolved as the game works its way through Alpha, and I'll update this review as new things get added, problems arise, and good stuff crops up. If you're hard up for a city builder, I only see this one getting better over time. If you're a bit more skittish, that's fair; but keep at eye on this and I encourage you to give it a shot when it's more complete.","June 4, 2015","true","67.4"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","23","23","0","0"

I love building and simulation games theres just something that appeal to me about creating my own little world and watching it grow.  I love The Settlers, Banished, The Sims and other games like that. This game ticks the boxes for me.\nIts a great game with lots of potential and while it may look like a minecraft clone it most certainly isn't.\nWhilst it still has a lot of bugs, which is to be expected in Alpha, it is still quite playable.  I found the worst bug was when i had too many hearthlings and they all started to just stand there and do nothing although if I shut the game down and restarted it, it fixed it for a while.\nA great Dev team is what makes it a gem too. They actually listen to their community and implement updates and bug fixes on a regular basis.\nI hope that they continue to update and finish the game as so many early access games seem to get abandoned and it would be a shame if that happened to this game.\nIf you want to support a game in early access then I wholeheartedly recommend this game.","August 7, 2015","true","17.8"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","27","30","0","0"

Tone down some of the rogue-like elements. Replace the esoteric production chains and mood  simulations with more accessible and managable alternatives. Add a charming 3D voxel art style with tons of character. Introduce some truly innovative mechanics, including the way hearthlings simulate building. Voila.\n\nOr, for readers that haven't had the privilege of learning how "losing is fun", we'll try a more popular game for comparison. Take Minecraft, pull it back to  a strategic level, give yourself hearthlings to manage, add in a bunch of depth with jobs and production chains, and smother it in buckets of charm. Welcome to Stonehearth.\n\nWhat Sets It Apart From Other Sandbox Strategies?\n\nCharming and effective 3D voxel art style.\nDeep production chains that don't dive off the deep end (ie: stocking a hospital in Dwarf Fortress).\nPromotes mixing form with function through a powerful and versatile building creator/editor.\nEngaging, visually appealing, and immersive construction simulation.\nDeep, yet accessible, statistics and job system with fun role-playing elements.\nInteractive military campaign that allows the player to engage in diplomacy or war.\nIntelligent user-interface design maintains accessibility even in areas of the game with more complex mechanics.\nThe Bottom Line\n\nI am recommending Stonehearth not only because it is already a successful sandbox strategy game in its own right, with truly innovative mechanics and an on-point blend of strategic depth and accessible fun, but because the small team at Radiant Entertainment have proven their exceptionalism. Since backing Stonehearth on Kickstarter I have enjoyed weekly updates, steady content addition that is continuously polished, and interactivity with multiple team members on their community forums. These guys care about making a great game, and it truly shows.\n\nStonehearth is a game that is worth your money and time right now, as of Update 10.x, and one that will only improve in value as those updates continue rolling in.","June 3, 2015","true","86.3"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","22","22","0","4"

You can even have people come to your town and reward you for killing off goblins\nCon's\nOne of the major issues with this game is the UI user interface it's extremely hard to work with, sometimes it glitches out and other times just completely shut's down and even makes you force shutdown the game.\nOne of the things that also really irritates me is the constant lag that occurs that is unpreventable no matter how much you Tinker with the options internally and (externally, outside the game) you cannot fix the lag issues I personally have constant issues with completing buildings and helping my citizens survive from goblins invaders, because the lag is so horrendously bad.\nNow keep in mind this lag is so extremely hard to work around and it only starts when you progress into the game far enough. Errors will occur almost every single play-through and it really makes you wish that they had some sort of patch for people to work with instead they're going update by update.\nThing's I want to see happen\nI wish that they would fix all performance issues and make it so your PC recognizes it as a game instead of a program.\nI want them to make an online multiplayer addition so you can play with AI or other players.\nI want them to make a campaign for story. Also add more action to the game so you can be full out assaulted and have to defend for like 5 minutes or longer.\nI want them to FIX something I did not mention above, which is when you ask a group of people to work on something new you can choose which citizens you wantr to work there so you have a spreadsheet. For example okay I want 3 citizens harvesting wood 7 citizens building a mansion and your guards to patrol in a certain pattern you choose.\nAlso larger worlds, larger threats as you progress so it won't be a breeze to clear out 6 invaders with 1 guard(with a wooden sword)\nOther than that this game is FREAKING AWESOME. At it's current stage it's fantastic minus all the performance issues. 8.3/10","July 16, 2015","true","33.3"," 39 of 51 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","39","51","3","10"

There really isn't much of a storyline, but I go in depth as far as gameplay goes.**\n\nSo I spent a good few hours on the game, getting a feel and really seeing what it has to offer. The fact that it is in alpha was a little worrysome, given how many games are labeled with early access and seem to die without much improvement or support. This game, so it seems, is different.\n\nIt's a refreshing change, it's truly quite unique in multiple aspects ranging from gameplay to art and design. This game is most certainly sandbox in nature, but it actually carries a very strong similarity to Dwarf Fortress, and almost seems like a branched-off, reskinned version of it. I can only imagine the vast amount of direction and improvement this game has in store if only the developers remain diligent and active.\n\nTo start.. As of the current build -524, you have the option of choosing a biome, starting location, and race. I haven't experimented heavily with these options; I've only had the pleasure of one play in which I haven't come all that far. That being said, once you choose your world, you then choose where in said world you will build your camp. Naturally, you'll want to choose an area with plenty of trees, wildlife, and minerals. Upon choosing, you're dumped off without much of a tutorial, which usually seems like an overwhelming experience, however.. This game is fairly straight foreward. After a few minutes, I quickly learned my way around the UI, the different tools, navigation, and issueing commands to my Hearthlings. Before long, the first raid on my settlement had taken progress. I immediately knew the general idea of what to do, click the large, red sword icon, right? It was as simple as that; my Hearthlings ran to a safe position as my assigned soldiers made short work of the beast. As of right now, the game doesn't seem to be too unforgiving. I am expecting that to change as I come further along and mine deeper into the ground.\n\nGraphically speaking, this game is very crisp and clean. There are a few annoyances which are more gameplay issues than graphics, but I'll get to those in a bit. The game has a bit of a minecraft appearance, but one with customer shaders and higher quality picture. Textures are almost non existant, but I can do without those, it simply works for this game. All in all, there isn't a whole lot of clutter, which can really turn into a big problem for games like this.\n\nIn terms of bugs, this game definitely has its share, but it's to be expected. I feel confident that more and more bugs will be fixed as time continues, the support website seems very much alive with devs attempting to help those who experience issues. A few bugs I've personally come across include goblins exploding into sunlight instead of fighting my soldiers, a Hearthling that never wakes up from his sleep, and not being to change to a specific class despite having met all requirements. Obviously two of these can be considered game breaking, however I'm not letting it kill my opinion of this game. Save often is the best fix for most problems.\n\nAs for one final in-depth review, this game is, as I mentioned, like a replica of Dward Fortress, though with FAR less features. I suspect this game is very heavily influenced by Dwarf Fortress. You have the ability to custom-build structures, or choose from a preset list. You can place said structures where ever they fit. You can alter the environment by taking down trees, creating mines, etc. As you create mines, it really opens up many different possibilities for construction ideas. Perhaps an underground fortress? All in all, in the short amount of time that I've played this game, I'm enjoying it a lot. If they can implement some more features or similarities from DF such as complex contraptions, many more monsters and biomes, etc, I'll be thrilled. Perhaps even a mode to take complete control of a single, hero-like individual to explore the lands, loot, plunder dungeons, and seek bounties, much like DF. I might be going a little far comparing the two, but regardless, the game can (hopefully) only improve from here.","February 21","true","4.9"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","27","31","2","0"

If you've ever play'd a game called 'RimWorld' It's much like that. Stonehearth is like a village management game, you gain a new civ every night [If you reach the days goal E.g. Enough wealth, Happiness & Food] This goal is meant to get harder as the game goes on, but it isn't really that hard to reach.\n\nCon's-The building in Stonehearth could use some improvements and I'm sure the developers will make this mechanic better. Once you place a building it cannot be removed.\n\n-You are not able to build easily inside E.g. In a cave/ Mountain.\n\n-When the goblins start to raid, it seems like they never stop coming night after night. They could use tuning down [Spawning less]\n\nPro's-So far I have experienced very little lag, to fix this all I did was re-load the game.\n\n-There're soo many options for the civ's. For example you can appoint them different jobs such as Warrior, Cook, Farmer, Trapper... Each with a new set of uniform & tools.\n\n-Very attractive game. Although the graphics are not Arma 3 standard, it doesn't need to be - the games graphics suit the game, the blocks have near enough a plain texture and puts less strain on your PC.\n\n-When your village does get attacked, It's not like a few games out there, where you're entire village would get destroyed Age Of Empires, I'm looking at you here.\n\nI've stopped playing StoneHearth for now, not because It's a bad game but because I'm waiting for more items to be implemented into the game.","August 29, 2015","true","9.7"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jomaxro/recommended/253250/","jomaxro","MacGyver","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jomaxro/","142 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst Steam review here, so go easy on me please!\n\nI had been following Stonehearth since its Kickstarter campaign back in 2013, and I finally bit the bullet back in August.  Since then I have enjoyed (almost) every minute of gameplay.  As many reviewers have noted, this is really a niche game, and if you are into a slow-paced city building sim with some RPG and RTS stuff mixed in, this is the game for you.  For me, I love setting up my little town so that it is self-sustaining, and then sitting back and watching.  Seeing the little Hearthlings running around, farming, shepherding, and cooking, all the while getting hungry and eating, and eventually relaxing by the fire and sleeping, it is really quite pretty to see.  Let me detail some pros and cons as I see it:\n\nPros:\n+Voxel Based graphical style\n+Custom Buidling Designer\n+City Building and strategy combined\n+Playable! (can't say this for all EA games)\n+Crafting system\n+Frequent Updates\n+Easy to learn\n+Game Community\n\nTo explain some of those, lets start with "playable."  You can install the game, launch it, and play away.  It works, and you can easily lose a couple of hours right off the bat.  Next, the custom building designer.  Is it perfect: no.  Can you make any building you can imagine: not yet.  But unless you are really trying to build an abstract, strange angled, multi-story building, chances are you can build it.  The crafting system is very nice, particularly the interaction between the crafters.  You start the game with a carpenter.  He/she can make basic furniture, building elements (like doors and windows), and a few other things.  He/she also makes some tools, like a farmers hoe to allow a farmer to be promoted, a mason's chisel for a stoneworker, a weaver's spindle, etc.  Once you promote another Hearthling to a new position, more crafting elements are unlocked.  For example, by him/herself, a carpenter can make a basic bed.  Promote a weaver, spin some thread, and a high leveled carpenter can make a fancy bed, with bonuses for the Hearthlings who sleep in it.\n\nThe final pro I listed which I want to detail is the game community.  Stonehearth has a fairly active community over on their forums, and everyone there is kind and helpful.  Members on the forum do their best to help each other out, and support is quick.  When I first joined the forum, I was greeted by a moderator after my first post, and recived quick help when I had an issue.  That made me want to spend time there, and as I became more familiar in the game, I started to help people out myself.  The developers are very active on the forums too!  They will help with game issues like crashes, keep you updated on bug fixes, and join in the many discussions about the game and where it should go.  They also stream development sessions 3 times a week, where you get to see work on the game live!\n\nCons:\n-Bugs, you will encounter bugs!\n-Crashing can happen\n-Saves are not always compatible between versions\n-Game is not feature complete\n-Can't build everything\n-Hardware intensive\n\nTo explain the cons: the game has bugs.  If you were not expecting that, I suggest you review what Early Access is.  That being said, the developers are amazingly responsive to fixing them, especially if they are game breaking.  Patches are frequent (sometimes too frequent), and they can break save compatibility.  Fortunately, they have 2 branches of updates on Steam, so if you do not like frequent updates, you can stick to a "stable" branch, and not deal with the frequent develop releases.  Crashing can (and likely will at one point) happen.  Many times it is due to driver issues, but also due to anti-virus programs.  As the games AI is based in an embedded chrome browser, programs that add extensions to chrome can cause havoc.\n\nFinal con, the game is not feature complete.  You cannot build every possible structure, there are many classes/professions that are not availible, and the game is not fully optimized.  I have played games where Stonehearth has used as much as 9 GB of RAM!  While the usage has dropped significantly in the latest patches, it is still not perfect, and honestly higher than I feel it should be.\n\nSo, should you buy this game?  I will answer with a qualified Maybe.  If citybuilding, simulation, strategy games are your thing, then this is an awesome game.  If you want a say in how the game is developed, than take the plunge.  If you like being a part of an active community that is passionate about the game, then hop aboard.  However, if you want a bug-free, fully optimized, feature complete game, then this is not for you (yet).  The game is in alpha, features are in active development, but it isn't quite there yet.","November 19, 2015","true","198.2"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","0"

The devs are also slow to add content to the game, so their support for this game is quesionable give how long this game has been in early access.\n\nAlso, the UI can be clunky in places and your townsfolk while mining can trap themselves and die. The game tries to notify you when they're about to die, but it's usually too late. I think they should be able to build ladders themselves and get out of the mine without having to send one of your other people over to build a ladder to get them out. Also, your townspeople will literally work themselves to death if ask them to carry something back to your town from too far away. It seems like these people could say something like "I'm not strong enough to that" to prevent accidental deaths or a UI indicator of how far they can go out to carry stuff back without dying. These kind of things are very annoying but you can get new villagers to replace them fairly quickly at least.\n\nYou can make buildings for your townsfolk, but I don't see a point to it other than you like to build things. There is no weather cycles or seasons yet and the towns folk have no issue with sleeping in beds outdoors and eating outdoors. Buildings take a long time to build and they don't seem to be worth this investment in survival mode. Walls are okay, but monsters tend to bust down your gates rather quickly. The maps are very wide open in places, so the option to build bigger wall sections would be nice.\n\nThe classes your villagers can become are cool (there's about 10 or so), but there really isn't a lot they can do and many items are there just for cosmetics. Some classes feel much more fleshed out than others currently. I think this feature will be great once it's finished.\n\nStill, the game has a lot of charm and I had fun with it while it lasted, but the game in no way feels finished, so buyer beware, it may be a while before this game is done!","June 4","false","11.6"," 32 of 44 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","32","44","0","0"

I jumped into this game at alpha 2. Not as far back as others, but right around the begining and man have I loved the ride. This game is not a minecraft clone nor is it "stealing" hearthstones name. It is a wonderful sandbox city builder with rpg elements to it. The devs are amazing and stream every week allowing the community to be involved and have input into the game. Yes there are lot of bugs right now and yes its fustrating at times, but this is an early access game, this is still in development and its still amazing. My only regret is not finding about it sooner and because of that I didnt get to back the kickstarter, but i have been with the game since. The game is easy to pick up and hard to put down, it lets you be as creative as you can get and challenges you at times. The devs allow mods to be made so if there isn't something in the game you want, you can add it! Over all the game art is cute, the music is beautiful and the game has so much more to give!\n\nIF YOU DO NOT LIKE: bugs, works in progress, unfinished games, more content to be added THEN DON'T GET IT AT THIS TIME!! no one is forcing you to buy it now, wait if you want until more things are in the game. DON'T buy it and then complaine about the bugs and problems... Its EARLY ACCESS for a reason.\n\nI love this game and I recomend it to anyone. I also recomend taking a look at the discorse. The community is wonderful, you can get the answers and news you want to know and you can give suggestions that the devs will see and could add into the game.","June 3, 2015","true","117.5"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mindlessme/recommended/253250/","mindlessme","MindlessMe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mindlessme/","419 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst and foremost you need to understand that Stonehearth is currently in ALPHA. This means there will be bugs, unoptimized code, and a range of other things that appear in alpha level content.\n\nAlthough Stonehearth isn't a revolutionary game, it is still very enjoyable. Even though I’ve only owned the game since Alpha 9, I have spent enough time in the game to get a good feel for the gameplay, features, and overall value of the game. At this point in development I can recommend the game for those looking for a fun game, but aren’t afraid to test out builds, and find bugs.\n\nIn the games current state your goal is to not kill all your hearthlings. When starting the game you are given virtually nothing to survive other than a tool to make a carpenter and a trapper. From there your job is to craft tools, give hearthlings jobs, and start to grow a tiny civilization. If you are playing on the Peaceful game mode then you really don’t have anything to worry about beyond keeping your hearthlings well fed. The other game mode at this time is Normal, and includes some nice goblins for you to fight with. The goblins don’t make the game overly difficult at this time and really just add another degree of play. Personally I enjoy playing Normal since it can be somewhat boring playing on peaceful mode.\n\nAs of Alpha 10 the goblins haven’t been in the game very long. They do a nice job of adding more gameplay options though. With the inclusion of goblins you will need to take defense into consideration while building. They will not attack you immediately upon starting a game, but they do increase in difficulty as you grow stronger.\n\nOne of the strongest points this game has is the robust building mechanic. You can build whatever structures you can imagine, as long as it’s within the boundaries of tiny blocks. The build mode is very simple to use and really help you personalize it to your taste. When you get a structure created you can even save it to use at any time after that. It’s a really nice feature since you don’t have to worry about designing each building every time you need it. The game also allows you to edit the building before placing it, giving you a chance to personalize each one without the need to recreate it from scratch. The only issue I have found when designing the buildings you can’t add in items like desks, beds, chairs, or other things of that nature without having them created and sitting in your stockpile. Luckily you just need 1 on hand to add them into the building blueprint.\n\nAt this time the hearthlings don’t really have traits, but they do have stats. The stats are things like speed, courage, diligence, etc. and can affect how well a hearthling does his/her given job. As development continues I am sure we will see more stats, traits, and other features added to the individual hearthlings.\n\nThat is really just a rundown of the main features the game has at this time. If you are interested in learning more about the game feel free to join us over at the Stonehearth.net forums. We always have some discussion going about the game, and keep up with all the little bugs in need of squashing. You can also find my pros/cons breakdown below.\n\nPROS\n- Music\n- Art style\n- Crafting system\n- Builing/Blueprint system is awesome\n- Fun factor\n-Replayability\n-Great development team\n\nCONS\n- Occasional building issues\n- LUA issues(LUA hits 100% causing game to lag and freeze)\n- Ocassional errors while playing\n- Lighting/Shadow issues\n\nThe only con that I’ve found to really be a hindrance is the LUA problem the game runs into. You can see the game resources in real time while playing via a small bar on the bottom right of the game client. Once the LUA usage hits 100% the game will lag completely out. This is a known issue and will hopefully be addressed soon.","June 3, 2015","true","34.2"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","0"

Think about it as Banished in casual mode, your whole town won't be wiped out by a deadly plague or cruel nature, just simple attacks from goblins, so if you enjoy more building than surviving through series of rage, I'm sure you'll enjoy this game a lot more. You get to control these villagers called Heathlings, assign them classes, see them working it through and even advancing to other classes. (which are not complete yet since it's still an early access, many classes are still ???) You get to craft many furnitures, design your buildings, decorate it as well. (To add to this, the furnitures are also very cute♥) If you can look over the early access and horrid perfomance issue that they're continuously fixing, (I have to use the word horrid, I have to restart my PC everytime I'm done with this game and it lags like crazy after a few days ingame which is still a common issue atm.) it's a relaxing fun game nontheless.","January 8","true","83.9"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

This is the kind of game I can lose myself in, starting a play session, getting really focused on building and defending my town, and then I look at my clock and 6 hours have somehow gone by.\n\nThe latest focus on combat and hardmode have brought a much more intense feeling to the game. Enemies can catch you offguard if you don't think about all angles you need to defend, and the new RPG classes have added a lot of depth to the combat side of the game. As far as developing your town/fort/city-whatever goes I becom a kid again, playing with lego.\n\nThis is in alpha, so there are still a lot of glitches, missing features, and polish that is getting fixed/added. Building elaborate structures is usually very difficult especially getting the hearthlings to construct them. You can cheat structures in with console commands, but hopefully some day you won't ever need to use commands again and the little guys will be able to make anything you want.\n\nOne of the best things about this game is it's devs. They are very community focused and they actually stream on twitch coding and art sessions three times a week. They aren't very active on the steam community hub, but on their own website's discourse they are very active.\n\nI really recommend this game even in it's current alpha state. Very enjoyable building game with some decent RTS RPG style gameplay.","May 13","true","256.3"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","1"

Basically, it's a work in progress alpha game.\nPros:\nExcellent dev team, great mod support, fun game with lots of potential.\n\nIf you want a polished, feature filled, bug free game then stick StoneHearth in your watch list and wait a bit.\n\nIf this looks like your kind of game, you want to have input into the development, you don't mind playing a game that will crash on you or just break because you clicked a button that causes an error, and you want to support Team Radiant.  Then buy it now.\n\nFull Alpha 10 ReviewIntro\nWhen you buy an early access game you are not just buying the game, because that isn't ready yet.  You are buying a look into the development of the game and the team behind it, and you get to play along as it's made, and then get the finished product at the end of it.  In my opinion the team at Radiant Entertainment are an amazing developer and I would happily buy into another early access game from them in the future based on my experience with them so far.\nWhat started out as a 2 man team when they launched their kickstarter has grown steadily over the past couple of years.  They have always interacted with the community with regular updates on their Dev Blog[stonehearth.net], answering questions, and helping on their Forum[discourse.stonehearth.net], and regular (currently multiple times per week) streaming through Twitch[www.twitch.tv] where they listen to and make changes from live feedback in the chat stream, explain the processes they are going through to help modding, and answer any questions people have for them about the game and it's development.\nI have total faith that this game will see it's completion and continued support afterwards.\n\nThe Game (so far)\nYou start with a small band of settlers with limited supplies and tools with the aim of building up a small town.  This is acheived harvesting materials, creating jobs, building items and tools, creating buildings (pre made and custom), and defending yourself from enemies.\n\nControlling your town is a a bit of mix at the moment between telling your Hearthlings (the citizens) to go do something and then being able to forget about it (such as farming), and having to heavily micro manage other aspects (such as controlling production of individual items).  The initial concept from the kickstarter was that you wouldn't have to micro manage things in the town, so I would hope that this will be the case as the game matures.\n\nThe building aspect of the game is developing well, and has had new features added with each new alpha.  You can choose to use a selection of pre-designed houses/buildings from Radiant or go all out and custom design your own.  The custom buildings part of the game is where I personally have experienced the most game breaking bugs, but it is certainaly getting better all the time.  If this is the part you are most looking at this game for I would hold off for a bit.\n\nEach Hearthling can be assigned a job/role within the community and will improve as they perform their tasks.  These include farmers, trappers, craftsmen, and guards.  These all work pretty well, although are all work in progress with the higher end skills still to be implemented.  And there are also new professions being added with each update.  Aplha 11 will be bringing us a cook, no more raw food!\n\nEnemies currently come in two varieties; undead, which will spawn on random nights and head to your town; and the goblins which are currently being worked on as part of the campaign that runs in game.  You do have the option to play on peacful mode if you want to build in peace and quite without having to worry about defending yourself.\n\nModding\nStoneHearth has been built from the ground up to support modding, and already has several great mods available, adding extra content into the game, changing the themes of the game and more projects in the works.  Because the game supports mods at it's core it is as simple as downloading a mod from the forum and dropping into the games mod folder.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nStoneHearth has a great team behind it, and is showing great potential for being an amazing game.  In it's current state you can definitly get several hours of enjoyment from the game, and get a taster of what is to come.  If you decide to purchase now expect to see bugs every game, from the amusing floating helmets, to annoying error messages, and I would recommend using the pre-made building templates until you are familiar with the rest of the game before venturing into more complex custom buildings.","June 6, 2015","true","183.2"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

The graphics have remained beautiful (if you like voxels) throughout, each iteration has led to massive improvements in gameplay, and a number of bugs have been fixed - and the game is still in alpha.\n\nOne of the "big deals" about this game is that it takes the dwarf fortress approach to items in the world and materials.  It then layers LUA scripting and html (no joke) for the interface.  Its modding system isn't a modding system so much a content-delivery system.  You want a new race? Describe some things in JSON and boom.\n\nThis leads to some very, very awesome potential for BETA once all the systems are fleshed out.  The latest update added the second Kingdom, and playing as it evolves into a completely different playstyle.. and as near as I can tell it wasn't much of a code update, just a "mod" from the dev's standpoint.\n\nThis is working out to be the ultimate kingdom builder / simulator.

Similar to Minecraft but relying on the villagers to do everything for you, you’d think the ai would work more effectively, but they still struggle from time to time.  Even trying to help prompt them so any ways, they still fail to complete tasks or build buildings.

It does not however, have the difficult learning curve that makes DF so in-accessible for people. Also, it has beautiful graphics, and has the option for a peaceful setup (for those not interested in fighting).\n\nIt has come a long way since the first alpha release for the Kickstarter backers (I joined post Kickstarter): the team is dedicated, and has been steadily working at improving the game, adding features.\n\nIt is by no means complete - but the team has been steadily working on the core functionality - and the promised set of features is large - multiple races, digging, and many more.\nThe development page which tracks features to be added is worth visiting.\n\nThe game also supports modding (which was built into the game from the start), which means that the final version should have lot of replay value / add-on value once the community creates mods.\n\nDefinitely a game worth supporting.","June 21, 2015","true","1.9"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","20","26","0","0"

I've followed the game and development team for 1 1/2 years and they put other Early Access developers to shame. They always keep in contact with us players, and are very transparent (hosting livestreams twice a week - where they show content being developed, and answer questions, and take suggestions/ideas, weekly development blog posts, responding to PMs and threads on the official forums, etc.). When you buy this game expect monthly-ish updates and alongside that pre-release versions to test out. (Very few Early Access games, update this often at all.)\n\nThe community is also awesome. Check out the official forums where you'll find lots of mods, artwork, animations, Let's Plays,  interesting discussions and very mature and respectable people.\n\nI really love this game, and its admirable and impressionable devs. I can tell you right now this is not your typical let-down Early Access game! I can say full-heart'dly to buy this game. It's 100% worth it.\n\nPlease note though, if you buy this game right now. It's still EARLY ACCESS, and things such as optimization or promised features are not all completed yet. The devs have worked really hard, and I hate seeing people flame the game, while blindly ignoring the fact that it still has a while to go in development.\n\nAs of now there is plenty of content, and it's fairly replayable. It runs quite smoothly for an Early Access game, too. I say go for it, but if you're picky maybe wait a while! :)\n\n[ P.S. - If you buy the game, please watch the weekly livesteams almost every Tuesday and Thursday - and also join the official forums, again really awesome community! :)! ]","June 3, 2015","true","1.4"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

Are you willing to wait for more features and enjoy the current game in the mean time? Do you like the genre of this game?\nIf you ansered yes, this game is for you.\n\nI have been playing this game pre-EA release, and honestly believe it is one of the most satisfying kickstarters I have ever backed and is already quite fun to play. It has a brilliant balance of city building, crafting and RPG elements, and rewards the player with a real feeling of progression. Each citizen has their own stats and skills which you can improve and you are able to get very creative with your architecture already with a little effort.\n\nPRO\n- Developer communication, every week there are numerous posts on their websites dev blog covering their progress and frequent developer streams where you may have direct imput in the creation of the game.\n- The game is being designed to be ULTRA modder friendly, I myself, someone with NO prior experience making mods have already made a few myself without causing bugs in the game in an alpha state. (Expect workshop support)\n- Frequent updates, the game is beginning to progress rather quickly and is adding features and busting bugs EVERY patch.\n- A wonderful art style, it maintains a simple charm while still looking brilliant and handling rather well even on less powerful machines.\n- Balanced progression, the game in this current state is slow enough to last but fast enough to hold your attention.\n- A fast forward button, I personally find this extremely important for things such as building or mining, or passing time while not active.\n\nCON\n- This is an alpha, EXPECT bugs. For an alpha it is a relatively low amount I have seen and they will be fixed soon enough but there WILL be bugs and if you go in to an early access game not expecting bugs you will be dissapointed.\n- Villager progression through classes is currently limited, only a few are implemented so far which does reduce the games variety.\n- can be hard at times as death of a skilled citizen can set you back for a while.\n","June 3, 2015","true","269.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","13","14","2","0"

By that I mean (and I don't know if others have this issue) when steam connects me to make one it brings me to a new window where I am not logged in. But that is neither here nor there.\n\nLet me begin by saying this game has AMAZING POTENTIAL! However currently the villagers' AI is lacking though it is still an alpha build. Even then the game is still playable though you'll have many of your troopers standing around staring off into the sun like idiots.\n\nThe great pros to the game:\n\nGreat potential.\n\nGood graphics that aren't hard on your computer (I'm on a laptop, furthermore one built for office work and NOT gaming and I still rarely crash).\n\nThe ability to build ANYTHING! Yes... anything! You can even build a giant hotdog if you wish.\nA city builder that isn't annoyingly complicated.\n\n\nThe bad:\n\nWell, the AI sucks as forementioned. That's a work in progress I hope.\n\nGoblin attacks happen very early. I only had a carpenter and I was still working on making a guard when the first attack happened. I lost three of my five villagers. So yes, this is a bad thing but this also hasn't happened every game so perhaps it is just bad luck.\n\nVillagers don't seem to really want to work but that's probably just the AI again. Also, there needs to be a method to making each villager assigned to a specific home or shop area.

The development team behind it has been super friendly and open with the community about their progress. They've provided a steady stream of updates since they launched their series of alphas and their weekly dev blogs are a good way to see what they're working on.\n\nThat said their progress hasn't been particularly impressive, there are many bugs and glitches and essentially a time limit as the ai eventually becomes so bogged down that the game slows to a crawl. Even one of their recent updates which added more interesting enemy types, only served to bog the game down.\n\nEven the coolest part of the game, how it lets you handcraft buildings is constantly held back by bugs and glitches. When it works you'll marvel at how cool your designs are, however when it doesnt work you'll wonder why the workers are so inept at something that in my opinion is a core feature of the game. If they could just get this one feature to work flawlessly it would probably single handedly make this game worth playing.\n\nSupposedly their process for adding content is completed and things like new classes, and enemy types are being added regularly. However things like co op, and their AI storyteller have seen little to no progress. The former hasn't even been started and considering all the technical hurdles they've had to overcome to just get this far, chances are multiplayer will be a loooooong way off if not abandoned, as they're already well into their second year of development.\n\nI suppose this is the nature of early access/ kickstarter. Despite how i've enjoyed this game on and off for these past years, the whole experience has just served to put me off on the idea of early access in general. In it's current state there's enough to keep you interested for a few hours, however sooner or later something will happen, some bug or glitch that will make you want to reload, start over, or quit till a new update.\n\nTLDR; this is definitely a game to watch, but they have a long road ahead of them.

I absolutely adore this game. I have learned about it some time ago and purchased it via Humble Bundle. Since then, I fell in love with it like never before, as this game is my dream game, one I have always been looking for. It is excellent mix of Strategy, Sandbox and City Simulation. This game, as you can probably tell by the screenshots and movies, have it`s own unique feel and it`s as cuddly and cute as it can get.\nFor now, the game is still in early to mid alpha, so there is much content to add, but even now game can be and is fun to play.\n\nWhy should you buy this game?\nDevelopers of Stonehearth, team Radiant, are the most amazing team of developers I have ever encountered in my gaming career. You wouldn`t probably believe how much they involve us (the community) onto the process of making game. First of all, they stream on http://twitch.tv three times per week, showing us how the game is being made, also taking countless advices from players (you could affect how the monster will look in game, how some mechanics should work or even name characters yourself). They also let us decide on how the game`s development should go from alpha to alpha (using https://trello.com/b/4XvM0SUd/stonehearth-community-roadmap) so we can choose what content should be made next.\n\nThe game have an amazing building system, presented in the trailer. Your little Hearthlings will build everything you can imagine voxel by voxel, using scaffoldings. The building system is very intuitive yet complex, and is being updated even more.\n\nStonehearth is made in a way that allows players to easily add mods to the game. There already some amazing mods made by community members, and we can expect even more of those coming soon.\n\nIf you, like me, always want the game to be as filled with content as possible, you can expect some good things from Stonehearth, In the final version there will be alternative planes, additional biomes, extra races to play as, huge campains to play, dozens of enemies and events randomed by computer Game Master. And much more, that`s for sure.\n\nLast but not least, you don`t have to be afraid of this game being abandoned by developers. They seem so excited about this game, and they don`t slow down while making this game in front of our eyes. I believe it`s a privilege being able to take part of making this awesome game.\nI r8 8/8 m8.","June 3, 2015","true","68.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The game is in development, and it will get better. With that in mind I’ve loved this game so far, and it’s been the easiest timesoak game I’ve had for years.\n\nThis game, in a word is pleasant. I've played games like Banished (which is probably the nearest comparable) where the biggest problem was keeping people alive, and the only way to do so was to go balls out at it deal with problems decades in advance.\n\nThis, like I've said is pleasant to the point of a city-building game being relaxing. I personally play games to chill out with, and I've always enoyed games within this genre so getting something I can actually chill out with is wonderful.\n\nIt's easy to understand, easy to progress through and at the time of writing (04/07/15) there are very few problems with it in terms of bugs that I’ve experienced, but I’ll detail any below. I do also have one or two suggestions but I'll detail those at the bottom. (Again, all in development stage. I don’t expect these to be addressed three weeks ago, chill your beans)\n\nOn the whole though, I've thouroughly enjoyed what these guys have offered already, and I can't wait to see what comes up in the future. It's a solid game as it stands, and it's far from a regretable purchase.\n\n-- For the below, I'm just assuming the devs are watching these things --\n\nBugs I’ve noticed\nI was able to place single tables within dining tables after building the wrong tables. I don’t know if this is unique but moving things around to get it straightened out was a ballache.\n\nSuggestions\nThe daily report – while I fully respect people’s desire to blast through games like this. A play through on peaceful mode (for example) where you play at a fairly slow pace leads to a situation where you can’t keep up with the daily goals. If these goals were changed from what seems to be programmed based on what day you’re on, to a flat ‘Achieve this level of food/happiness/net value to get a new person’ the whole thing would flow a lot better.\n\nA priority system, or a worker grouping could be set so sorting to storage can be made more efficient. For instance If I can make Phil gather a set range of materials (or if stores are refined enough, just tie workers to those stores). That or create a 'Runner' class of citizen, where their tasks is simply to move things around.

I actually Recommend it. The only bad thing about this game is the Price for the content the game has at this moment in time. Perhaps when the game is finished or when they add multiplayer this game will be worth it but right now it is worth around 10-20 bucks. Depending on how much you love games like these will depend how much you are willing to pay for it. I bought this game just to see if its worth it for the price and for the content it has right now its not exactly worth my money.

They have shown consistent and impressive improvements to the game, regular updates on the game and the team, and an active role in the discussions.\n\nA few notes on the game itself.  It is still very much a work in progress.  Features are still being developed and released, each one coming with it's share of bugs and quirks.  As should go without saying with any Early Access game, only purchase if you are interested in seeing the game grow, and want the chance to add your voice to the development.  Radiant has done a very good job of adding polish to the game as they went, but their primary focus has been features, the rest of the polish comes later.  That being said, I thoroughly enjoy this game, even in it's unfinished state.

I am still very excited that the devs for this game are really behind this and whenever there is an issue its fix ASAP, not something you can get for most other games these days.

As with most of these, you start with 7 people (In this game, they're "hearthlings") and from there, you need to set up for food, shelter, resources, and defense. So far so same, right? The two largest twists on this one are how you can set up the housing (completely planning out a building, instead of either a hole in the wall or a prefab structure), and the animation style.\n\nI'm trying to find a good descriptor for the animation style, and I keep coming back to "cute". It's not the word I'm looking for, but it does indeed match, in my opinion. I feel emotionally vested in these hearthlings in a way I don't really get from the likes of Gnomoria, Towns, or even Dwarf Fortress, and I honestly feel it's the way they're animated. When goblins are charging into your town and you see your farmers scatter from their fields and cower, it makes you want to protect them. The victories feel more visceral when your footman is taking a giant stone hammer to the goblins instead of just getting lines of damage text.\n\nThat is the best way I can really put it right there. If you're looking to just build a town, then there are hundreds of other games that do the same thing.

It's so buggy that it is absolutely unplayable. The developers update it regularly and I have full expectations that it will be one of the greatest city-building games ever made when it is finished.\n\nIt's essentially Minecraft mixed with Banished. You assign jobs and tasks that need to be done, and your little hearthlings go do it. You don't controll the hearthlings directly, you simply guide them. They can die from combat and starvation, so careful planning and resource management is very important. It's as much a game of strategy as it is creation.\n\nThe game is currently somewhat limited in the designs you can create based on the terrible AI of your hearthlings and the bad UI.

A lot of essential features are still missing. Being unable to tear down anything you've built being the big one. But there is a solid foundation and a lot of promise for the future and the devs are great at instilling confidence that they'll get there.\n\nCurrently the game seems a bit torn between macro and micro management. The devs are constantly struggling with how much they want the game to "play itself". You can quickly and easily design custom buildings or plop down existing ones from templates. Farms are plotted out and then self-sufficient. But then you have to go in and tell your carpenter exactly how many beds, doors, chairs, fense posts, etc to make for the buildings you're planning.  Most of the game so far is "set and forget" but then you have to keep a close eye on your crafters to keep them producing what you need.  I could do without that part myself. I'd rather be the city planner than micro-manage the supply chain.\n\nCombat is very basic right now. You have guards you can make better gear for, and set areas to patrol or attack but you have no direct control over them. It's more about "were you prepared ahead of time" than skill or micro-management.  This approach could work I think but there needs to be a lot more to it. Hopefully new additions like ranged combat that are being worked on will do just that.  If not, I think they might do well to have combat be the one area they allow micro management to play a key role in player engagement.\n\nOne thing is for sure, Team Radiant is handling the game's development very well. Communication is definitely one of their strong points. The community is always in the loop and updates are consistent and substantial. Bugs are common but generally fixed quickly.  I get the impression development has gone substantially slower than they initially anticipated but their commitment to see it through is rock solid.\n\nThe game seems destined to be good at the very least, so it's an easy recommendation. It just remains to be seen if Radiant has the design chops and polish in them to make it great.","June 4, 2015","true","89.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

That being said the price of $25 is a little steep for a game that is barely playable. I have put about 20 hours into it off steam, and will surely put more.\n\nIf you are  reading this i am sure you understand the game is in ALPHA and is pretty buggy, however the devs are great at talking to their community and are squashing bugs constantly,\n\nThere are several Game breaking bugs within the main mechanics that make it unplayable.\n\nThe building UI is a great idea, however the coding isn't right on it yet, Walls not being build, crashing when creating a big building, hearthlings not building a roof for your house for virtualy no reason. there are ways to make buildings with multiple walls, but most of them are tedious, requiring manual wall building, planning and erasing to get the building to work right, that is if you game doesnt crash on wall building or just make it so that you can not plan buildings anymore without save scumming.\n\nOther than the bugs, there are features that are not present (some that they plan to add) that i belive are needed to round out the game and make it playable. I will list them here in hopes of Dev eyes and to establish discorse :D\n\n-Stairs (they have already said its on its way, but without them it is hard to make multiple floors, ladders are visualy unappealing and dont support multiple hearthling travel)\n-Manual Job Prioities (I wish that hauling wasn't a top prioities unless i set it as such)\n-Underground Walls and rooms (Though possible, it is tedious, anothering on their to-do list)\n-Better Mining Interface (Wish i could change all three tunnle dimentions)\n\nThose are some basic things that i am sure they will add, but without them currently it makes this more of a proof of concept than a game. Here is a list of some otherthings that i belive will make up for the lack of depth\n\n-Hearthling Personalities (Other than 3 stats, there is nothing that seperates one hearthling from another, making the game a bit shallow)\n-Diffrent Starting Zones/Biomes/Varity (These are already on the To-Do list, right now there is almost no varity in starting zones.)\n\n\nReally i had intentions for making this a long review and listing out everything i want to happen in this game in hopes of others seeing it and influencing the game, however it is just to soon to tell, they have so many good things planned for this including Multiplayer i only wish i didnt hear about this until it came out of early access, i yearn to play it everyday in its complete state.\n\nSo should you buy it?

Charging $20 for a a game that you can experience everything in within 4-5 hours of gameplay is criminal, in my opinion.\n\nWhile I was watching some of the video reviews/let's plays, I saw that the characters don't have any sort of customization. They have no outfits, you can't assign them to a bed and decide where each one lives. This is fine with me, but I figured it was a trade-off for a more in-depth crafting system and/or building system. However, I was disappointed to find out that this was NOT the case. The crafting is very surface-level(and extremely annoying to level). The buildings have very little functionality other than to make your villagers do what they already do, better.\n\nOverall, the experience was a bit underwhelming. It was too much of a simulator(and not even a good simulator at that) and not enough of an interactive city-builder, like I thought it would be. I actually bought this game because I played Cities: Skylines and felt that too much based on the simulation and less based around fun, but in the end, this game left with a similar feeling.\n\nTLDR: Fun game. Cool art. No depth. Very little content.\n\nIf I could reccomend a couple things to the developers:\n-Add more character customization. Instead of trying to build more into the "job tree", give each person with that profession a separate talent tree that gives each character some identity and gives you a reason to have more than one of them other than just that their job isn't being taken care of.\n-Add more functionality to buildings.\n-Increase villager cap and allow for more space to build on and allow towns to be converted into cities.\n-Add more tutorial information. Almost all of the stuff I had to learn how to do, was learned via videos. The tutorials taught me very little about how to play the game.\n\nP.S. I will be keeping an eye on this game with high hopes that it will be improved in future.","January 3","false","2.1"," 53 of 95 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","53","95","3","0"

HOWEVER...\n\nI have been with this game since it's first playable release... wait... sorry since it's second playable, you get it.\nIt is charming, and rewarding. You build up each and every buiding as well as Hearthlings (your villagers) for better or for worse. Each Hearthling can be given a job (Blacksmith, Carpenter, Hunter. ect. ect.) and based on some seemingly random stats, they will preform well or just level really slow.  When you have enough food/shelter/wealth - more villagers will start to join you (I swear they just  appear, no idea where they come from) Yes, they level to. They also die as well... which is why it is important to have someone with a sword handy at all times, otherwise the raiding goblins or night creatures... will end the town abruptly.

Sure, and I would recommend buying it LATER if you don't want to deal with small and some major bugs.

Support the devs and then go to their forums to post any bugs you find!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrestonGarveuy/recommended/253250/","PrestonGarveuy","Preston Garvey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrestonGarveuy/","80 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTL;DR\nA great Village building game with mechanics similar to Minecraft, Banished and Dwarf Fortress. Well worth the money asked. Developers are HEAVILY involved in development and community relations, along with consistant and crisp graphics.The community of Stonehearth show how amazing this game is, and how much potential the developers have.\n\n---------\n\nWhere do I start on this brilliant game? I've been watching this EA game since Alpha 2, and have finally decided to buy it. There are hundreds of pros and minimal cons. It is well worth the money asked for (you could wait until the summer sales heil gabeN) Or you can spend it right now!\n\nPros:\n\n- The Developers\nThe developers are heavily community focused, implenting features people think would suit the game, as well as fixing game breaking bugs that are encountered. They do frequent updates (Around one every few weeks) and keep the community informed with "Desktop Tuesdays" where they show off new features being implented\n\n- Beutiful Graphics\nI don't often judge a game by it's graphics. But this is an amazing exception. The graphics are smooth, clear, and crisp, it often reminds me of Minecraft (minus the 16 bit textures) due to its simplicity. The graphics are consistent, and don't randomly change with updates.\n\n- The Community\nThe community is very well knit, and are welcoming of new players. You can often find them helping new players settle in to the world of Stonehearth, and help solve problems with bug fixes.\n\nCons\n- Crashes\nLike most EA games, there are lots of crashes, there are a few crashes here and there, but if you remembered to save, you're in luck, they've recently added an autosave feature, which is absolutely brilliant, to make up for these crashes. They can be often caused by new features (the 64 bit update)\n\n- Steep learning curve\nLike Banished, it's going to take A LOT of tries to hit the ground running, but after learning why and where you went wrong, it gets a lot easier (my current "village" is on 40 hearthlings) and eventually you will end up with a small town.\n\n- AI\nThe AI in this game can be, at times, tedious, often when you mark a place to be deforested, they cut it down, but refuse to transport it to a stockpile (knowing me this will be the problem on my end), but eventually they get around to it.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI believe that this game has a HUGE potential, and that the developers are prime examples of what should be the norm in the game industry (I'm looking at you EA) The community is one of the huge aspects of this game, there is some mod support, but sadly most are either broken or outdated. This game is well worth the £19 asked, with many features still to come.","June 9, 2015","true","14.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

I love the medieval, high-fantasy settings of the first three, and the feeling of control in the last two. I have always been looking for a city-sim game that has a medieval look and feel, with an optional mixture of (high) fantasy. World of Warcraft was one of my first games. It certainly knocked the medieval requirement out of the park. Then, in 2011, I found Skyrim. Boy, did I love Skyrim. It was perfect, except.. it wasn't a city builder. I had no control of my environment in those other two games, I just had to play with what I had. So then I found Banished. It was perfect - medieval, city-builder.. but no real touch of (high) fantasy, and the only thing I had to worry about was resource management.\n\nSo a couple days ago I saw this game and fell in love with it the minute I saw the trailer video. It had everything I wanted - it was in a medieval setting, (high) fantasy, and it was a city-builder. Sure, it was in Alpha stage, but so what? I bought it and love it. The bugs and constant errors are annoying, but it is barely close to a final stage.\n\nAll I can say is, is that if you want a city-builder where you can pretty much control every aspect of your game, set in a high-fantasy medieval style, you'll love this. Some people might not like the voxel-based graphics, but it is worth it.\n\nNow, I know I didn't delve into the actual game much, but if you're interested, when the game hits Beta or final release, you can check back for my full review. For now, if you want to help in the development of an amazing game, here it is.","July 4, 2015","true","299.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","9","12","4","0"

This game if you can run it (i have an asus M32bf with a gtx 770 and i can run this at 80/130 frames) is really addictive since you can make a large sprawling city after about 2-3 hours of gameplay OR you can make like a mining civilization that lives in caves.\n2- Engaging.

Stonehearth is a game like no other, it combines City-building/Sandbox/Survival genres into this perfect storm of New-game feel.\n4- A E S T H E T I C, This game has GOOD pixel graphics, and because of this, it makes it very simple to pick up if you are used to Medium-Long learning curves to games.\n\n"Cons"\nOk this game is in alpha, so what, if you are anything like me, a simple bug or two is not gonna bother me, but if you are annoyed by a villager not doing what you want, then buy this game later when it's a bit more stable.\n2- Pricey, if you don't have disposable income like me, don't bother yet, try and wait for a steam sale.\n\nGuys and Gals, this is who inspired me to buy this.

(Some times it works.)\n-Footmen will continue to fight even when they are almost dead and you keep telling them to retreat.\n-Villagers often will stop constructing a building and never finish it.\nMost of these bugs force you to restart your village.\n\nAlso speaking of buildings, the current building tools are kind of limited as you can only make simple structures. The visuals are limited too, as you can only use  one or two material types and colors for each section (Except roads and floors). Also you cant make big stone castle walls, or add individual voxles to make detailed stuff.\n\nCritisism aside, it's a wonderful game.

I backed the game for $30 USD in April 2013 on Kickstarter, while the project timelines of the original crowd funding were not met, the transparency and progress on the game by the developers at Radiant Entertainment have always been thoroughly communicated.\n\nDespite original project timelines not being met, the team has continued to grow and be staffed were needed, which in my opinion demonstrates sound management on the part of team. This is not a pick up and run with your money type of project. Updates are provided consistently and feedback is incorporated via the games blog, forum, trello roadmap, and Tom and Tony's tri-weekly twitch development streams.\n\n\nRadiant Entertainment was founded by evo2k (the fighting game tournament) and shoryuken.com, founders Tony and Tom Cannon, who had years of working at vmware before venturing on this project. Tony Cannon also wrote netcode middleware GGPO, which was a turning point for online play in the fighting game genre.  I backed the game because of their history, these two have remained accountable and have earned the FGCs trust having been a cornerstone of the community.\n\nTo conclude, the development of this game two years after its successful crowdfunding campaign continues to demonstrate a level of accountability and trust that is among the best of early access games.","June 3, 2015","true","3.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Open and honest Dev team\n2. Game is genuinly fun\n3. Endless possibilities for its finished potential\n4. Mod support is a thing\n\nI have been a supporter of this game since the kickstarter campaign. It has gone through some very rough, very unpolished builds (seeing as this is currently in alpha 11), but the progress is constant. Each update comes in a timely manner and each one is noteworthy. The devs are open and honest about who is doing what and when things are likely to happen. If there is a setback they will tell you. This in of itself is a massive selling point for this game, just look at the mess that is Godus for a comparison. Regarding the game itself, its what I always wanted in a voxel style game; the freedom to create a city/kingdom from the ground up with my own unique band of citizens.\n\nBuilding is fun; you can follow a few set blueprints or make your own from scratch. As the game develops you will eventually be able to make massive castles, but for the current version as of june 2015 multi-story buildings are the new thing.\n\nCombat and resource gathering are about what you would expect, but agian this game is in its early stages and will become deeper as builds go on. Some of the stretch goals filled include elemental enemies and several magic using classes of hearthling. It is still in its early stages, but with the team behind it I am confident the potential will be realised.\n\nAnother commendation to the dev team behind this game is that from the outset they have encouraged modding. In the future I would not be surprised if the modding community embraced this game like they do bethesda games.\n\nIn closing, its a great game with a great team behind it and its only going to get better as it develops. Grab it now and become part of the community and help the devs out, because you will be hearing about this game in the future, and you will want it then anyway.

Development is promising, and the game itself is continually growing. I love this kind of game, however, in its current state, stonehearth is probably worth between $5 and $10.\n\nThe game is very easy - I've so far been able to repel every attack, destroy every enemy base etc with two soldiers (I might have been overdoing it adding the second soldier, too!).\n\nBuilding is very bugged - I've had to cancel innumerable buildings as my villagers couldnt construct certain things or have gotten themselves stuck whilst trying. Being able to watch individual pieces on your building be placed by your citizens is cool but has lead to so many issues when actually performing this key functionality.\n\nProgression is basic and unfulfilling - you are a fully self-sustaining within 1-3 days of in-game time. Sure, this might not be a problem, as the game may intend to focus on thriving rather than surviving. However, thriving is impossible as the game cannot seem to handle having >12 citizens (at such numbers, you will see a lot of idling, and citizens with professions flat refusing to do their allocated job whilst there are other things to do - and no, the citizen management screen does not resolve these issues).\n\nKeep it on your watchlist, but unless you are looking for a very surface-level experience, steer clear until further down the development cycle.","January 11","false","50.2"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","1"

It's like a god game where you boss around a group of Minecraft players. You don't control your hearthlings individually, you simply direct them on what to do and they go and do it. The most control you have is in putting down a banner to tell a group of footmen to fight in a particular area (useful for invasions). Of course, you also tell them exactly where to mine, what trees to chop down, and what to build, you just don't control your workers to do this directly. Do well, and more hearthlings will join your mighty settlement. Do poorly, and your hearthlings will die by the crude sword of a goblin or die of starvation. It's a fully 3D voxel game in a randomly generated world where you mine, harvest, build, and conquer. The crafting system is still a work in progress, but there is a lot of stuff you can build, lots of upgrades for your workers and soldiers, and you can pretty much do whatever you like in the sandbox setting. Just look out for campaign events sent your way by the Game Master system (right now there's one campaign in three parts, but many, many more campaigns are coming). In addition to the campaigns are visits by travelers and traveling merchants you can deal with. These will give you some opportunities for trade that may benefit your settlement. Oh, and did I mention the game is extremely moddable? Oh yes, this is an indie game company that recognizes the value of their community, and wants to put the same tools in your hands that they use themselves to create content.\n\nRight now Stonehearth is in alpha, Alpha 10.5 as I type this. Please don't buy this game yet in Early Access if you can't handle some bugs, even game-breaking bugs. Don't get too attached to your settlements, either; your save game won't be compatible with the next alpha, and new alphas come fairly quickly. Radiant Entertainment is a fantastic company and they've been great about keeping players informed about what's going on, and fixing bugs pretty fast, but some of you may find the game unplayable at various times. If you're willing to help them test and submit useful bug reports, great. If you're coming here expecting a fully playable game hold off and wait for Stonehearth to get into beta, at least. You'll have a lot more fun then.\n\nAccording to their roadmap, about 90% of their custom core engine and technology is built. They're still about 70% on world generation, 60% on building tools, 50% on classes, 30% on the Game Master, and 20% on monsters and denizens. Multiplayer is coming too, but that's a long ways off. It's also worth noting that Mac and Linux versions are coming too, once they've got the core game finished.\n\nThat said, Stonehearth has come a very long way in a short period of time.\n\nThere are now 8 classes in the game in addition to the regular worker type class you get as the base. These include the Carpenter, Farmer, Weaver, Footman, Trapper, Shepherd, Mason, and Blacksmith. These provide the raw materials, and food your settlement needs, as well as the various tiers of crafted goods that allow you to advance up the tech tree of the game. Workers wearing a fancy set of clothes move quicker. Footmen with upgraded weaponry and armor are a lot better equipped to handle invasions of zombies, goblins, and wolves. And, of course, unless you want your hearthlings to live in a hole in the ground and sleep on the cold hard dirt, you'll want your carpenter building doors and windows for your houses, and your weaver can build nice curtains and make the cloth for your upgraded furniture like comfy beds. The mason will build stone walls and gates to keep invaders out or your shepherd's sheep in. Your crafters will of course build the tools necessary to upgrade your workers to advanced classes, as well. You can't have farmers without a carpenter to build wooden hoes. The interactions of these systems, combined with the need to manage your limited workforce, make the game complex and strategic. A lot of farmers means lots of food to attract new settlers to join your community, but not as many workers digging out tunnels to mine for valuable ores and increase the wealth your community has, wealth being another requirement for attracting new settlers.\n\nIn terms of the rest of the game, the building and harvesting tools have come along very well since the earliest alphas. At this point you can actually play the game, and get pretty far, doing pretty much what you want. Want to build a gigantic fort with a moat? Yep, that's possible. Want to build a deep lair in a mountain, with the entrance looking like some kind of huge voxel head with flaming eyes at night? Yep, that's doable! Just carve away into that mountain. There is, as I mentioned, only one Game Master campaign at the moment, so each play-through will feel a bit repetitive, but they are still building the systems behind such things. Once these systems are in place, they will add a lot more Game Master content (and modders will be able to add their own campaigns as well).\n\nWhat I like best about this game is that you can really just play it however you like. The settlement I keep building each new alpha is very different from the settlements I see other people building. Technically the game is a sort of RPG/RTS/Roguelike, but at its core it's a sandbox game. It's a very fun sandbox to play in. While I would recommend this game to everyone, I wouldn't recommend you play this yet if you'll be bothered by pop-up error logs or if your game suddenly stops working and that settlement you spent hours building suddenly can't be played with anymore. These problems do happen. They've gotten a lot rarer since Alpha 1, but this is still an Early Access game in alpha, and you should only buy this now if you have a tolerance for bugs.","June 3, 2015","true","119.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's like a god game where you boss around a group of Minecraft players. You don't control your hearthlings individually, you simply direct them on what to do and they go and do it. The most control you have is in putting down a banner to tell a group of footmen to fight in a particular area (useful for invasions). Of course, you also tell them exactly where to mine, what trees to chop down, and what to build, you just don't control your workers to do this directly. Do well, and more hearthlings will join your mighty settlement. Do poorly, and your hearthlings will die by the crude sword of a goblin or die of starvation. It's a fully 3D voxel game in a randomly generated world where you mine, harvest, build, and conquer. The crafting system is still a work in progress, but there is a lot of stuff you can build, lots of upgrades for your workers and soldiers, and you can pretty much do whatever you like in the sandbox setting. Just look out for campaign events sent your way by the Game Master system (right now there's one campaign in three parts, but many, many more campaigns are coming). In addition to the campaigns are visits by travelers and traveling merchants you can deal with. These will give you some opportunities for trade that may benefit your settlement. Oh, and did I mention the game is extremely moddable? Oh yes, this is an indie game company that recognizes the value of their community, and wants to put the same tools in your hands that they use themselves to create content.\n\nRight now Stonehearth is in alpha, Alpha 10.5 as I type this. Please don't buy this game yet in Early Access if you can't handle some bugs, even game-breaking bugs. Don't get too attached to your settlements, either; your save game won't be compatible with the next alpha, and new alphas come fairly quickly. Radiant Entertainment is a fantastic company and they've been great about keeping players informed about what's going on, and fixing bugs pretty fast, but some of you may find the game unplayable at various times. If you're willing to help them test and submit useful bug reports, great. If you're coming here expecting a fully playable game hold off and wait for Stonehearth to get into beta, at least. You'll have a lot more fun then.\n\nAccording to their roadmap, about 90% of their custom core engine and technology is built. They're still about 70% on world generation, 60% on building tools, 50% on classes, 30% on the Game Master, and 20% on monsters and denizens. Multiplayer is coming too, but that's a long ways off. It's also worth noting that Mac and Linux versions are coming too, once they've got the core game finished.\n\nThat said, Stonehearth has come a very long way in a short period of time.\n\nThere are now 8 classes in the game in addition to the regular worker type class you get as the base. These include the Carpenter, Farmer, Weaver, Footman, Trapper, Shepherd, Mason, and Blacksmith. These provide the raw materials, and food your settlement needs, as well as the various tiers of crafted goods that allow you to advance up the tech tree of the game. Workers wearing a fancy set of clothes move quicker. Footmen with upgraded weaponry and armor are a lot better equipped to handle invasions of zombies, goblins, and wolves. And, of course, unless you want your hearthlings to live in a hole in the ground and sleep on the cold hard dirt, you'll want your carpenter building doors and windows for your houses, and your weaver can build nice curtains and make the cloth for your upgraded furniture like comfy beds. The mason will build stone walls and gates to keep invaders out or your shepherd's sheep in. Your crafters will of course build the tools necessary to upgrade your workers to advanced classes, as well. You can't have farmers without a carpenter to build wooden hoes. The interactions of these systems, combined with the need to manage your limited workforce, make the game complex and strategic. A lot of farmers means lots of food to attract new settlers to join your community, but not as many workers digging out tunnels to mine for valuable ores and increase the wealth your community has, wealth being another requirement for attracting new settlers.\n\nIn terms of the rest of the game, the building and harvesting tools have come along very well since the earliest alphas.

Stonehearth wears its inspirations on its sleeve but has its own unique charm and play style.\n\nStonehearth is, as is described by its creators, "a game about exploration and survival in an epic fantasy setting where your job is to help a small group of settlers survive and carve out a place for themselves in a hostile land". In other words, your goal is to help a group of settlers (or "hearthlings" as they are called) to create a colony.\n\nYou are the mind beyond the operation, you do not control your hearthling directly, you lay out the general plan (mine, build, etc) and your hearthlings commit your plans by themselves. There are also a few RPG elements in the game, like a job three, levels, stats and percs.\n\nTwo things that i really like about the game are the art style and the emphasis on modding. The devs of the game have built their own game engine with emphasis on modding, which can only increase the lifespan of the game. The game has a really easy to use, and nice looking GUI. the animations are cute and i really like the character design. there is a lot of small things that makes the style of the game charming.\n\nThe last thing i would like to mention is the awesome community that as been created around the game. since the kickstarter days the game has come a long way, the devs are active in the forums and are actively engaging with the community, they even stream the game development 3 days a week on twitch!\n\nAll in all the game is very promising, and even though it is missing features it's very fun in is current state. it has a long way to go but I'm really hopeful for its future. if you like what you see give it a try!","June 3, 2015","true","20.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You will be able to design your own town however you want by gathering resources and deal with goblins, zombies, and Skeletons invading during the night. You will promote your workers (hearthlings) to gain more food or build certain items. Now I know that doesnt sound like much but getting to play with all the different types of layouts, buildings, and designs is enough fun to make you play for hours. Of course this game is not complete so you will find bugs which many of us players have been reporting in.\n\nWe the players also have the important job of reporting bugs and telling the Developers what we would like to see next.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kalbintion/recommended/253250/","Kalbintion","キャルビンシュン","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kalbintion/","99 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is a highly enjoyable, in development, town building game. I have spent many hours building towns, learning the game, and enjoying the new game aspects they are adding from patch to patch as well as the bug fixes.\n\nWith all of the good things however, there are a few bad.\n- The map generation takes quite a while per map roll (time consuming when looking for specific setups)\n- Save files are not compatible with updates, meaning you will need to restart each time there's an update\n\nThese two things are not game breaking major, and they are wanting to implement the backward compatibility with save files, to prevent the need to constantly restart with updates, so it should no longer be a problem when they implement it.\n\nThis game offers unique textures and means to build your town as well as prevents the need to have them always be building whatever is placed, which helps prevent accidents. This lets you build roads, houses, and other structures the way you want it. Do you want a flat area? Doable, do you want a roof-less house? Doable. Multi-structured mansion? Doable. Throw your guys in a hole and never able to get out? This can also be done, and those who are fans of the Tycoon games, such as Rollercoaster Tycoon, you will be familiar with the ability to trap your visitors where they cannot leave, or killing them with rides. Make this your own experience with the city and enjoy yourself as you do so.\n\nI will modify and go into more detail with this review as time goes on and as the game develops.\n\nUpdate 11/27/2015:\n\nThis game has received quite a few updates since the original review. They have added the ability to create multi-tiered structures in the game, however this feature is a bit wonky and not 100% working in my opinion, as the settlers will often fail to build the bottom half of the house before the upper half or not build the building at all. They have also improved the errors that may happen in the game - if something were to bug out, it is no longer in a nasty developer box, but rather something a bit more user friendly to understand and depending on what fails, offers instructions on fixing the issue.\n\nThere are some present AI issues in the game that can make it a bit frustrating to have a large amount of tasks, I've been able to circumvent this issue in the developer versions of Alpha 13 - which is said to fix the AI issues in regards to building, etc, but may not be 100% done yet - by removing the request and redoing it or suspending/pausing the task then resuming it. Assuming there isnt still a ton of things already requested for them to do, they often figure out that it still needs to be completed. The game is still very much in a playable state and I still highly enjoy it and my original review still stands at this point in time. They are making progres toward finishing the game and adding features. Please note that at the time of this update, that saves are still not backward/forward compatible. And my original con of the map generation taking a lot of time still stands as well, but it feels a bit faster than it once was.\n\nA few other major things they've added are a new style of settler and a new map biome type - the desert and raya's children. I've been able to play around with them in the developer build and its a very interesting change of pace to the normal gameplay that I had grown to love. This in combination with new professions and crafting systems in place permit for a more diverse and intricate creation system, making it feel like the crafters actually rely on each other to make the final product rather than it being a one man army. They have also vastly improved the game experience with making it run faster on my machine, and offering various options to help with slower/older machines as well as bug fixes. I haven't had massive bugs in regards to the UI or other pop-ups outside of one where I was clicking on buttons rapidly.\n\nSo let me mark off my cons at this point in time in regards to Alpha 12/Dev Alpha 13:\n- Some AI issues in regards to tasks where they fail to complete (see above for my solution and some info)\n- Map generation still takes too much time\n- Save files are still not backward/forward compatible\n\nThis said, let me list some pros of this game thus far\n- Multi-tiered structures\n- Intricate crafting system\n- Ability to trap your settlers\n- Aggressive (normal surviving) & Peaceful mode (for building)\n- Various travelling merchants\n\nThere's a lot more as well that I would list off but this review would end up to be too long.","June 3, 2015","true","70.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

For people unfamiliar with the game, the LUA/Pathfinding increases in memory usage until your citizens stop moving, building, or completing any actions, so the game comes to a complete stop. It's happening to pretty much everyone in the community, people are complaining on the forums, and in a recent Twitch stream the game developers have stated that fixing it "isn't a priority for them", instead they want to add staircases(?). With the current development cycle it will probably be a couple years before this is playable and I can fully recommend it.","September 24, 2015","false","57.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game is not finished yet but still worth the price.\n\n=INFO ABOUT THE REVIEW=\n1. This review is about my point of view and opinion. [If you disagree on a certain point or want to correct me: Be reasonable or i will ignore your comment.]\n\n=REVIEW=\nFirst i just have to say how happy i am that this game finally hits Steam. It was on Greenlight for a while and now finally it is on Steam. I have gotten the game before over kickstarter and i am just going to say that i usually dont get things over kickstarter. For me kickstarter was always a big risk and i never wanted to take that risk. But with this game it was completly different. The cute style and the idea behind it made it to something i just wanted to have.\n\nThe game overall is a normal little Building/Survival Sim. You have a certain amount of Settlers when you begin and start with nothing but a fire and a Townsflag. Over the time you build up your village and go up the steps towards a city. Mining, Smithing, Farming and even Fighting is already included in this and makes the whole experience already alot better than it looks on the pictures, even though they look quite good. (<3)\n\nI cannot say how much i love this litte piece of art. This is one of those games where the devs really sit behind their game. And i am not saying this just like that. First before buying the game i had a chat with one of the Devs and i gotta say that i enjoyed it. After buying it i found a bug to submit and it got rid of right away with the next patch that came a few days after the report.\n\nThis game has a big future. Please whoever reads this: Be part of this future because i am sure that you will love it!","June 10, 2015","true","31.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There's not much game here yet, but you can tell the devs are seriously devoted to making Stonehearth the best they can make it.  Even in this early stage you can tell it's the most charming, enjoyable 'concept' of a game out there (check my hours, and that's just through Steam).\n\nThe devs work closely with the community every step of the way and are immediately responsive to most all bug reports and suggestions.\n\nThe only caveat I can think of, is that it has been a long, long time getting to even where it is now, and it still has a long long way to go.  I do think it will get there and I have the utmost faith in the devs, but don't expect it in a mere few months.\n\nYour money invested here is not to have a fleshed out playable game today or tomorrow, but to help ensure the devs can make Stonehearth all it can be.  You won't have a game you can play day in and day out... just yet.. but it will happen and it will be wonderful.\n\nEdit:  I've changed my recommendation to NO for the time being.  There's just too little game here for the high price they're charging.  That high price was fine for kickstarter where you were investing, but now they're selling it on Steam and there just isn't much of a game here for that kind of money.  I also have concerns about how long development is taking.  Don't forget, this game has been in development for two years before it hit Steam early access. Over two years now and frankly, not much has happened for such a long dev cycle.  I honestly think the devs have gotten in over their heads and don't quite know how to dig themselves out of this hole.\n\nI'll happily change to Recommended when I see this game kick into high gear, but for now, it's 'wait and see'.","June 3, 2015","false","96.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But i'm afraid for myself personally, that after night 10-15 I've run out of anything to do. You build houses, and then........ um..... well thats it. Even on the "survival mode" you can get by the entire survival mode with 1-2 warriors. Or just build a wall or a fence and you've outsmarted the game.Only thing i've found lately to make it a bit more challenging, is to increase the number of goblins or undead attacking me to keep it difficult. After about day 15 or so the workers kind of stop caring as much about getting things done, they also seem to get confused with where their food is even when theres a stockpile next door to them. I'm personally having a hard time with the food concept of the game, and NO I dont want it to be a sim. But why do I need 18 acres full of food to get one more person? No one eats much but for some reason I need SO MUCH FOOD. I feel like this game doesnt have any point after you made your first couple cute houses and made room for all the food you will need to get more people so you can...... so you can have more people to.... to build more houses.. well you get the picture. Can't reccomend in current state or for that price. Look forward to see what's on the horizon for this game.

So since there are regular updates and fixes i have no reason not to recommend this game.\nNot all is great but i believe that it will be polished on the way.\nDigging up and down is badly done, needs re-thinking. The whole way how to look thru the ground in various heights is pretty badly made making it very difficult sometimes to see what you need to see when you ve been digging quite a bit.\nThere is no way how to place dirt blocks back, they make no drop, no resource, so if you accidentally dig away something, you can only "build" a piece of stone back, but in x-ray view you will always see it there. There is no way how to make the your folk stop picking certain stuff up. So if your warrior dies in a gnome camp, your minions will keep running there to pick up the sword after the dead body, dying one by one. Sometimes they appear to die for no reason just like that, since the game doesnt tell you what happened you are just left wondering. I only played two games but there seems to be some sort of randomisation in various jobs position in the job tree, sometimes its the potter that is below the mason in the tree and sometimes its viceversa, this left me quite confused. The building system as a whole is a bit strange, i managed to design my stone tower, placed it on the ground and ordered start of construction, but nobody did anything and i didnt know why. There isnt enough of information about things, sorta ingame wiki. What does affect the sattisfaction of shelter? Food? Which food is the most sattisfactory?\n\nOptimization is another issue which surprised me. When you town is population 15+ the game will start somewhat lagging. Sometimes re-loading the game helps, sometimes it just stops on its own, its weird. But on my high-end PC its defo not a HW issue.\n\nThere is a whole lot of things id like to see improved and i have no doubt that they will get improved. It already is very pleasant to play, has nice music, nice graphics, nice gameplay. Its very similar to game called Gnomoria, only with nicer graphics and heading in a little bit differend direction, direction that i like more.\n\n\n","January 6","true","8.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skalibran/recommended/253250/","skalibran","Skalibran","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skalibran/","253 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAlright, I've played this game far longer than steam is showing, because I played it hours before I had it on steam at all.\nAlso, I've been following this game for around two years now, and I think you can call me a fanboy. So is this review going to be neutral? No, definitely not! I love this game, and I probably oversee a lot of bugs. But at least it has a reason why I'm calling myself a fanboy.\n\nTwo years ago, I think summer 2013, I've noticed a game called Stonehearth. A german video game magazine called "gamestar" reviewed it. A sandbox town building game in a voxel based world? Call me childish, but I loved to build huge lego forts so this game was bought instantly using the humble store for a much higher price than it's here on Early Access. I do not regret a single penny. Back then, the game was nearly unplayable. You enjoyed the concept for 15 minutes, but no longer. But, and this is at least for me one of the only criterion of an Early Access game, the developers were active. They posted news frequently and from time to time a new update was released. Not that often like - let's say Space Engineers - but frequent and huge updates.\nNow we have come to the point where I can honestly say that you can play it for some hours - if you are aware of some gamebreaking bugs. For example: Your workers need to eat, but sometimes the AI is stuck so they don't go eating and then they starve to death. Also if you have some more workers in your town the performance is getting really worse.\nAnd there is not that much of content, but you are busy for some hours. And don't forget: You buy an Early Access game to support the developers, to get an idea of what the game is going to be and to have a nice game for a cheap price when it's released!\n\nNow to the game itself:\nImagine you play Minecraft. But not as a player, but as a god. And you can command your players to build stuff, to gather resources and to fight. Combine that with some RPG-mechanics (your workers, fighters, farmers, etc. can level up to be more efficient) and you have a nice combination of Minecraft, The Sims and SimCity in an medieval fantasy setting.\n\nThe thing I love the most about the game is the great atmosphere. When it is getting dark, your workers will put wooden logs in a fire pit, they will light it and then they will sit around it warming up. Then they go to bed. After waking up, they go back to work. There is a living day/night cycle.\n\nAlso there is a living world. At least a little bit. Don't expect too much right now, Early Access, remember? At night, skeletons and zombies are trying to kill you and at daytime, armed goblins try to take your stuff. You can defeat them and raid their outposts. Not that hard, not that satisfying, but the developers are on a good way.\n\nThe last sentence could say all about the current state of the game. You will experience bugs, you will experience gamebreaking bugs and you will have to restart a lot.\n\nBut Stonehearth is a lovely made game. The atmosphere is great. The gameplay is great. It is going to be awesome.","June 3, 2015","true","26.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game itself.. Is pretty nice, however.. You've got to admit that it has loads of flaws in it.. And one of them starts to shine through best when you try and play in hard mode. Makes it (almost) impossible to get off to a good start in that game mode, and will really start to have you wondering exactly how stupid your hearthlings are...\n\nAnyways.. the game needs some sort of way to prioritze things.. No.. I'm not meaning the little switches that say "This person should do farm, while this person builds." I'm meaning "Hey you stupid piece of meat, go pick up that herb. RIGHT NOW so that I can make an Herbalist or a potion." Without a way to give some sort of priority to what your hearthlings will gather.. Those who like to setup their villages to have a lot to do, won't usually have very much fun in hard mode.. If you try to plan too far ahead, the game will punish you greatly. As there doesn't seem to be a way to instruct your hearthlings to even drop all of their current queued projects.. And that is probably the most simple way to fix the issue.. It would suck to have to command your hearthlings to get back at it.. But It's better than having all of your starting hearthlings die, because you instructed them to build a house and they don't want to stop building that house to go get a herb until they're dead...\n\nFor crying out loud.. I told them to go gather some wild herbs, and had a farmer working on growing some herbs, and he ALMOST finished growing the herbs by the time my gatherers brought the herb into town... But to my surprise, they STILL WOULDN'T GATHER IT!\n\nEither the AI need improved to recognize that a lack of items is bad, and make it so that getting items that are currently set at 0 is more important than carrying back the wood that you have 500 of or there needs to be a way to prioritize certain tasks.. Like by holding shift and telling them to gather this item.. They know that is more important to do than anything else.. Or even a way to over-ride it and say "This needs to be done first." Alternatively.. Like I said.. a way to tell your hearthlings to stop EVERYTHING. could work as well.\n\nMaybe some of this is already in the game and I'm just not seeing it.. But before a hard mode can really be explored too much, little simple things like this really need to be fixed.. Even if there is a way to clear all commands.. A priority system would go leagues and bounds beyond it.. and make the game feel more professional as well.","May 18","true","87.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","4","5","3","0"

I recommend this game to anyone who likes creative sandbox games and even the casual RTS gamer.\n\nIts alpha, so obviously there are bugs being worked out. None of the bugs are game breaking and most can be fixed by simply saving and reloading. They also make console commands available as a work around for some bugs.\n\nIts great for releasing your inner creativity. Think of building something in Minecraft or Terraria, except not having to place each individual piece yourself. You design the building in a design mode and when you are finished editing you hit the build button and then your people do all the work. This makes building larger more complex structures much less time consuming. There is a building template saving feature so that your creations can be saved for other games. If you make a massive structure simply save it and you can copy paste it to another world, all you need is the materials.\n\nThe combat is fun as well, but can be turned off if you wish to play in the sandbox mode. Being able to assign units to gaurd (footmen) roles and creating/finding better gear for them to use. The game gets progressively harder to a point then seems to level out and nothing can defeat your footmen. But again its alpha and the combat was only just released so its basically there to be tested and tuned.\n\nMultiplayer has not been implemented yet but it is planned in the future and I believe that this game has some great potential at some fun multiplayer gameplay.","February 9","true","25.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Do you like Minecraft? If you answered "yes" to either of these, you'll most likely enjoy this game. If you answered "yes" to both, you'll DEFINITELY enjoy this game.\n\nTHINGS TO LIKE:\n\n+ The building system is the most robust of any citybuilder I've seen to date. You not only get to lay out buildings for your Hearthlings to construct (very intuitively, in my experience!) but you get to place furniture within and without at your whim. There's already a great deal of different types of furniture and decor your Hearthings can craft.\n\n+ The music is excellent. It's rich and well composed, and it gives the game a very quaint feel.\n\n+ Game generation is simple but fun and really makes you feel like you're having an impact on your game before it even starts. You roll a set of Hearthlings, each with their own stats, and can even name them. You also get an amount of gold to spend on a selection of items to start yourself off with. You select your options in storybook form when the game asks you to pick between two types of Hearthlings (one medieval-ish group and one nomadic, desert-like group), two types of biomes (temperate or desert), and two types of game (either you can be raided by enemies or you can't). Then your map is generated and you select where on that map you want to settle. Each region has access to different resources.\n\n+ Trade events. Just about every day, a trader will come by offering different deals. You can buy or sell certain goods from some, some will ask you to make them x number of items then come back after a set amount of time to trade you something agreed upon for them... It keeps things fresh and gives you new ways to get resources you maybe don't have access to based on where you settled.\n\n+ Hearthling jobs. There are several different jobs in the game and they all feel useful. Every Hearthling starts off as a basic laborer, who can only gather resources, haul them, or build. With items (most of which are constructed by the various crafting jobs), you can promote a hearthling to any number of other jobs such as Farmer, Carpenter, Tailor or Trapper. Every job has levels that increase as your Hearthling performs that job and gains experience. At each tier, a new ability is unlocked. These range from increased speed to the ability to randomly create high-quality furniture that takes on a finer appearance than the base item being crafted. Many jobs are also laid out in a tree wherein you must have a Hearthling of level x in one job to promote to another. For example, Cook requires Farmer at level 3.\n\n+ The ability to save your building designs for easy placement later.\n\nTHINGS THAT NEED WORK:\n\n- Currently it's very difficult (possible though!) to build a second floor that functions. I'm sure this will be ironed out as the game plods along in development, though.\n\n- A few of the job abilities aren't implemented yet, but this will definitely be remedied later just on nature of the status being "not implemented".\n\n- You get occasional errors when trying to do things, pretty much always in regards to building. They haven't crashed the game for me, it's basically just the game telling me the engine didn't understand what I was trying to do.\n\n- Sometimes the building bugs a bit, but all that generally means is that you have to cancel building and start designing from the start again. Bit of a pain, but with trial and error, you'll get where you're going, and this is sure to be ironed out in the long term.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\n\nIt's already an incredibly addictive game for me. In its current state, I'd rate the game a solid 7.5/10. It has the potential to be at LEAST a 9. If for whatever reason you trust my opinion, I'd tell you this game is worth the buy right now. It's one of the sharpest alpha states I've ever seen for a game and there's already so much to enjoy and lose hours in. Five hours in, I've only scratched the surface of jobs and the like and I'm still going strong. I can see myself easily logging over 100 hours in this thing.","February 15","true","15.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It does everything a simulation civilization survival game should do. It has a bit of leveling up, looser micromanaging, customizing buildings, unlockable classes, and a better feel of the open world. When your Hearthlings get hungry and you ask them to harvest berries, they don't starve themselves on a job and wait for another job class to go do it, they stop everything and grab some wild berries. I will say Gnomoria has a leg up in terms of making your own classes and uniforms but I'm sure as this game progresses it'll have the same options if not more that Gnomoria had to offer. The music isn't half bad and is soft however it does keep reminding me of the little mermaid...\n\nIt is an EA and like all EA's theres errors but to have the game working on the day of steam release is a first +1 for its score, having a few options +1, having a save and load function +1, having most of the key features working in-game +1, having a balanced and playable gameplay +1, and finally I only encountered 2 bugs that have already been reported the headless bug and the red error box when making a custom house, neither were game breaking or that annoying due to being able to move the red box and the heads stay on if you zoom out. So for me a personal +1. I also want to wrap up by saying a huge HUGE THANK YOU to both the greenlight voters and the developers! The developers I thank you for stepping up to the plate WHEN YOU FELT READY, taking time to process your game and release it almost stable is a huge hat off to you (even though I don't wear hats).\n\nThe price is a bit of a shock to those with lower paychecks and what with the economy the way it is don't be to embarrassed to wait. This game has great delivery, great promise, and a great dev team so far from what I can tell at least. I'll wrap this up by saying Steam needs more Indie dev teams like this who wait until the game is stable and has most of its key elements already in game.","June 3, 2015","true","11.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The development team is very transparent, honest, and are not willing to give up on their vision like so many other games have. Unfortunately, that means that some things take longer to do and have more bugs because the implementations are more complex.

I’ve been playing the game since Alpha 3 and it’s the only early development game i’ve had zero regrets about purchasing.\n\nCommunity And Developers:\nThe Stonehearth Discourse is full of awesome and helpful people. It’s a very good grouping of gamers really trying to help each other out. Friendliest discourse on the net.\n\nThe developers at Stonehearth truly are one of a kind. They continue to be very open about what is happening with the game and participate in discussion on the discourse. They REALLY do listen to feedback, i've seen it happen multiple times where the community will spotlight a great idea and it makes it into the game.\n\nBut the main thing is… they stream THREE times a week on Twitch, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Two design live streams and one coding stream. Tony and Tom answer questions accept feedback with the best of them.\n\nOn top of this, they do a development blog once a week, sometimes twice.\n\nAlphas get pumped out one every 6-8 weeks on average. In between that, they update the unstable branch that allows you to play test the upcoming features, and those come pretty quickly after main Alpha releases.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game plays great You set up the tasks and then can kick back and watch as your Hearthlings go to work. Farmers need to direction as they constantly plant, harvest, and replant food. The trapper will automatically head to the trapping zones you set up, survey the lands, and place out traps to catch small game. And one of my favorites... footman will patrol along your roads and stockpiles, wary for danger.\n\nWith the Dungeon Master Ai system, it spawns events and campaigns (I won't spoil what) that come to mess with your village. In some cases, you are given multiple options on how to handle it.\n\nOverall:\nI think the Devs said it best\n\n"It’s important to understand that Stonehearth isn’t finished yet. Not by a long shot. But Stonehearth, as it stands now, is a game with fun, robust gameplay and plenty to do and explore."\n\n\nPros:\nCommunity ++\nDevelopers ++\nDevelopment Speed +\nDeveloper Openness and Communication ++\nPlays smooth\nJust good Fun!\nOozes Character and cuteness\nDungeon Master System AI\n\nCons:\nBuggy! (it’s alpha)\nPrice is in the mid-high range for EA, but seems right for the final game.\nGame Still has a long ways to go to be fully featured","June 3, 2015","true","144.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I recommend this game to anyone who likes creative sandbox games and even the casual RTS gamer.\n\nIts alpha, so obviously there are bugs being worked out. None of the bugs are game breaking and most can be fixed by simply saving and reloading. They also make console commands available as a work around for some bugs.\n\nIts great for releasing your inner creativity. Think of building something in Minecraft or Terraria, except not having to place each individual piece yourself. You design the building in a design mode and when you are finished editing you hit the build button and then your people do all the work. This makes building larger more complex structures much less time consuming. There is a building template saving feature so that your creations can be saved for other games. If you make a massive structure simply save it and you can copy paste it to another world, all you need is the materials.\n\nThe combat is fun as well, but can be turned off if you wish to play in the sandbox mode. Being able to assign units to gaurd (footmen) roles and creating/finding better gear for them to use. The game gets progressively harder to a point then seems to level out and nothing can defeat your footmen. But again its alpha and the combat was only just released so its basically there to be tested and tuned.\n\nMultiplayer has not been implemented yet but it is planned in the future and I believe that this game has some great potential at some fun multiplayer gameplay.","February 9","true","25.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Do you like Minecraft? If you answered "yes" to either of these, you'll most likely enjoy this game. If you answered "yes" to both, you'll DEFINITELY enjoy this game.\n\nTHINGS TO LIKE:\n\n+ The building system is the most robust of any citybuilder I've seen to date. You not only get to lay out buildings for your Hearthlings to construct (very intuitively, in my experience!) but you get to place furniture within and without at your whim. There's already a great deal of different types of furniture and decor your Hearthings can craft.\n\n+ The music is excellent. It's rich and well composed, and it gives the game a very quaint feel.\n\n+ Game generation is simple but fun and really makes you feel like you're having an impact on your game before it even starts. You roll a set of Hearthlings, each with their own stats, and can even name them. You also get an amount of gold to spend on a selection of items to start yourself off with. You select your options in storybook form when the game asks you to pick between two types of Hearthlings (one medieval-ish group and one nomadic, desert-like group), two types of biomes (temperate or desert), and two types of game (either you can be raided by enemies or you can't). Then your map is generated and you select where on that map you want to settle. Each region has access to different resources.\n\n+ Trade events. Just about every day, a trader will come by offering different deals. You can buy or sell certain goods from some, some will ask you to make them x number of items then come back after a set amount of time to trade you something agreed upon for them... It keeps things fresh and gives you new ways to get resources you maybe don't have access to based on where you settled.\n\n+ Hearthling jobs. There are several different jobs in the game and they all feel useful. Every Hearthling starts off as a basic laborer, who can only gather resources, haul them, or build. With items (most of which are constructed by the various crafting jobs), you can promote a hearthling to any number of other jobs such as Farmer, Carpenter, Tailor or Trapper. Every job has levels that increase as your Hearthling performs that job and gains experience. At each tier, a new ability is unlocked. These range from increased speed to the ability to randomly create high-quality furniture that takes on a finer appearance than the base item being crafted. Many jobs are also laid out in a tree wherein you must have a Hearthling of level x in one job to promote to another. For example, Cook requires Farmer at level 3.\n\n+ The ability to save your building designs for easy placement later.\n\nTHINGS THAT NEED WORK:\n\n- Currently it's very difficult (possible though!) to build a second floor that functions. I'm sure this will be ironed out as the game plods along in development, though.\n\n- A few of the job abilities aren't implemented yet, but this will definitely be remedied later just on nature of the status being "not implemented".\n\n- You get occasional errors when trying to do things, pretty much always in regards to building. They haven't crashed the game for me, it's basically just the game telling me the engine didn't understand what I was trying to do.\n\n- Sometimes the building bugs a bit, but all that generally means is that you have to cancel building and start designing from the start again. Bit of a pain, but with trial and error, you'll get where you're going, and this is sure to be ironed out in the long term.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\n\nIt's already an incredibly addictive game for me. In its current state, I'd rate the game a solid 7.5/10. It has the potential to be at LEAST a 9. If for whatever reason you trust my opinion, I'd tell you this game is worth the buy right now. It's one of the sharpest alpha states I've ever seen for a game and there's already so much to enjoy and lose hours in. Five hours in, I've only scratched the surface of jobs and the like and I'm still going strong. I can see myself easily logging over 100 hours in this thing.","February 15","true","15.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Listening to the gentle hum of my PC as I watch my little hillside hamlet of Edoras expand, 4 houses, a public feasting building, a guard barracks, a blacksmith and a completly filled food storehouse. Every little hearther is happy, at peace and happy in life as we press further into the hillside, ever expanding, handing out food to passing merchants - we have plenty- in exchange for fancy chairs and rustic fire pits for the long houses. We gather to eat and jest, then sleep in simple beds with roaring fires to keep us warm.\nThis is simple. Peaceful. This is Edoras.\n\nOk, I'll be truthful, i was expecting a quick hour or so to get into it, set up farms, housing... basic stuff then just steam roll it for a half hour then refund it cause i wasn't enjoying it.\nBut no, Stonehearth has this... charm to it that i just can't pinpoint. Maybe it's the building system - you have a few preset designs and the rest you can build using a fairly simple but effective system of drag selections and semi voxel based building -, maybe it's the constant strive to better your town and lure more hearthers (little voxelly pixelly villagers) into your town for workers.\nMaybe you just enjoy the sense of wonder of seeing your town flourish by your hand.\n\nStonehearth is probably already worthy of a release, i don't even begrudge them £18.99 because the game is truly extremely fun.\n\nBUT\n\nOne problem is... The AI... the hearthers are a little... single minded, monkey see, monkey do sort of thing. Like place desings for a house... they start building. Good. Place designs for another hosue and a... idk, a storehouse, and sometimes theyll  all flock to build the storehouse and begin construction. So that house you placed first unless you reinstate the build order, will become last priority. Not bad as such, just a little... irritating seeing half built buildings (storehouse and blacksmith in my village) being used and slept in with no roof, half a wall missing, and no door.. :p\nPersonal peeve and i'm sure others will feel the same way...","June 24, 2015","true","18.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has become one of my favorite pc games ever. No joke. It has unique gameplay and a very nice plot. It even has story progression for once you get to about the second in-game month, goblin camps start appearing. The game itself looks very well made and polished but even for this game, it has got PLENTY of cons.\n\nFirst off it is highly buggy and mainly when designing or building a house. Sometimes building the second story wall makes it two layer and overlap leaving it unable to undo or do anything otherwise without restarting the game. The AI could also use incredible amounts of work. They don't build under bridges of any kind and they need to be specifically ordered to do so or they will never get anything done. There is a feature that needs to be added single-handedly and that is making it to where the AI always run back to headquarters. Everytime there are mobs coming out and chasing after my Hearthlings, do they go towards the footmen who could kick some goblin ♥♥♥? Nope. They run out to the woods to dig their own harty graves. That's not all for I have had to start my game over far to many times due to the poorly-made engine failing from doing simple tasks.\n\nBut the reason why you see this thumbs up on this review is that this game overall has massive potential. And since I adore early-access games so much, I have gotten used to these bugs. But, then again, when the developers ditch the game to run off with the thousands and millions they make, then it is a big thumbs down for me. But greatly enough, they are still updating it. Maybe a bit slow at times, but they are still producing the game towards better recreational fun.

It does everything a simulation civilization survival game should do. It has a bit of leveling up, looser micromanaging, customizing buildings, unlockable classes, and a better feel of the open world. When your Hearthlings get hungry and you ask them to harvest berries, they don't starve themselves on a job and wait for another job class to go do it, they stop everything and grab some wild berries. I will say Gnomoria has a leg up in terms of making your own classes and uniforms but I'm sure as this game progresses it'll have the same options if not more that Gnomoria had to offer. The music isn't half bad and is soft however it does keep reminding me of the little mermaid...\n\nIt is an EA and like all EA's theres errors but to have the game working on the day of steam release is a first +1 for its score, having a few options +1, having a save and load function +1, having most of the key features working in-game +1, having a balanced and playable gameplay +1, and finally I only encountered 2 bugs that have already been reported the headless bug and the red error box when making a custom house, neither were game breaking or that annoying due to being able to move the red box and the heads stay on if you zoom out. So for me a personal +1. I also want to wrap up by saying a huge HUGE THANK YOU to both the greenlight voters and the developers! The developers I thank you for stepping up to the plate WHEN YOU FELT READY, taking time to process your game and release it almost stable is a huge hat off to you (even though I don't wear hats).\n\nThe price is a bit of a shock to those with lower paychecks and what with the economy the way it is don't be to embarrassed to wait. This game has great delivery, great promise, and a great dev team so far from what I can tell at least. I'll wrap this up by saying Steam needs more Indie dev teams like this who wait until the game is stable and has most of its key elements already in game.","June 3, 2015","true","11.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love RTS games and iv allways wanted/missed a city building game with a medeival/fantasy theme and now here it is. It gave me a realy good first impression; artstyle of the game is wonderfull, the mechanics for now is also nice though it still needs some work, most features are great. I have much hope and belief that this game will become a great.\n\nSome important notes:\n\n- Graphics/artstyle is fine and refreshing, it resembles minecraft obviously but much more clean and polished so i wouldnt be worrying about the graphical look if you're that type of guy. Artstyle, by the look of the concept art there is a lot more cool stuff to come and im eager to test out the upcoming updates.\n\n- Mechanics in the game are okay: Not bad or to unique which fits perfectly, it may be a bit tricky to learn the basics in the game without a tutorial or guidline in-game but its workable.\nI love the ability to  customize the buildings and housings entirely from scratch , this was a suckerpunch for me and sold me. You can then later on decide what the building should be used for and as (example blacksmith, barracks, tavern etc.. etc). You can also customize the interior as in rugs, curtains, style of furniture and so on.\nI find it amusing that this is a RTS with such neat customization features, it realy makes it fun for people who appriciate city building games down to the tiniest details.\n\nClasses of the workers so far is well made, cant complain besides the lack of a ranged/archer class but that will be added later and many more other classes as well have they noted.\n\n- Lore/Story, not much to say about that now in the Alpha but after what iv read it looks promising for what is to come. There are some quests with the goblins which are pretty neat but there isnt much else to say about that.\n\n-Upcoming features; Multiplayer, coop will be fun i believe. Im looking more forward to the concept of coop in a city building game, im interested to see if they will make it so players can build one big city together and manage it as well, if so that would be awesome.\n\n\nThe negative about the game?\n\nIts an alpha, bugs and glitches are to be expected. Only major flaw i find in the current alpha is that the game will lag/crash when you pass the villager/worker limit of 25 +. Besides that i cant find much flaw in it knowing a lot more concent will be added and fixed.\n\n\n\nI strongly recommend the game 8/10, its a neat mix of RTS and RPG . Its like a small mix of Warcraft 3, Banished, Age of Mythology and Age of Empires.   40 hours in  and its just a alpha! Realy entertaining so far, and i look forward to what the developers will do with the game.","September 1, 2015","true","167.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It took me an hour to get the game going in the compatibility section of Windows and editing the "user_settings.json" file.  Even after I had the game running, it crashes every 30 to 60 minutes.  There is also a User Interface problem that keeps showing up that prevents you from clicking on GUI buttons and makes the game unplayable and prevents you from saving the game.\nThis game is early access, but for $25 dollars I feel it should be more playable.  If it was selling for $10 these issues would be more forgivable, but not at this price range.\nFrom what I see on the forums non-Windows 10 machines have much better luck running this.  I would recommend Windows 10 users waiting three months or more and then checking the forums to see if these issues have been resolved.

The game has settlers left in the wilds to fend for themselves.  They slowly start to learn the basics to create their own city and a home for themeslves.\n\nAt this point, though, the game is not ready.  The bugs are hard to get over and the game has not been updated to handle 'end of game' content or what happens when you level.  I build a place for everyone to sleep, to eat and then I'm pretty much done.  I have everyone collect resources, but really this only happens sometimes.  My blacksmith or Mason level up to create new things for my settlement, but I'm unable to impliment them, I don't see a reason to use them, and I can't make my own due to glitches.\n\nNow I don't want you to stray from the basic game.  Despite this all, as I frist stated, the game is headed in the right direction and I hope it continues that way.  If the developer can pull this all together I think we'll have a huge hit on our hands a game I won't be able to stop playing.\n\nI do think the game is worth a try!

The play-style is very much as a Cultures-like game, where you give your citizens a profession, which they get better at/more experience with. And then they can learn the next step of the profession tree. As an example Trapper(Hunter), who get's the bright idea that, "Hey, i can just have animals in a pen, don't have to run around setting traps". Much like how it works in Cultures, but you do not have any direct control over your citizens besides assigning them jobs. Some jobs, needs a workbench placed (Click on the citizen you have assigned a job to set a workbench), from there you can order items that the worker will make over time. The more they make, the more they can learn to make, some items can also be "Fine" which looks nicer.\n\nAny citizen that dosen't have anything to do, will help build buildings, mine, gather items and cut trees if given the general order (You select areas to mine/cut trees, which then whoever got time for it goes to do it). The games building system is pretty smart, tho still needs some slight work. Easy to build, place the floor. Auto-snap walls, auto-snap roofs, manually placed windows and doors. But the game also offers building templates, so just click and drop more or less(Works well if you don't want to use time building fancy buildings).\n\nThere are currently two game modes, one which has enemies (Normal) and one without any dangers (Peaceful). The game is not very challenging just yet. Tho it might be a good idea to try out peaceful, just to get the general hang of things before heading into normal.\n\nThe game itself looks great, very aesthetically pleasing, the characters look charming, smooth animations, pretty great character variety, trees have different ages and sizes. Terrain looks nice, eventho slightly plain right now. Will be looking forward to a bit more variation.\n\nCurrently the game is in need of optimization, but that is something that will come along, especially since this is still in a early alpha. Alpha is all about adding new features and stuff for you to do. Optimization mostly comes from the beta. If you get a low framerate, i highly recommend turning down shadows if you have some performance problems.\n\n\nConclusion:\nPersonaly i really love it, it is a solid city-builder/managing, with some added rpg and combat. I know city-building isen't for everyone, but this is a great entry into the genre.\n\nWorth buying, if unsure, take a look at some gameplays!","June 5, 2015","true","79.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Constant content updates but no bug updates. (Early access rules clearly state the game must be playable through all stages of development) but as time went on the game's bugs were slowly pushed back, some weren't completely removed. Of course this is all expected of a early access game, however it was pretty bad.\n\nEvery now and then I come back to stonehearth and see the amazing improvements they have made. Since the game is early access it has its limitations, one of the major ones was the "idle bug" which caused all of the villagers to permanently cease any and all activity and the save would be permanently broken. However they added a cap of 24 villagers now and optimized the game. So now we are limited to just 24 villagers.\n\n\nAll in all I love the game and love the spirit of stonehearth 8/10","May 21","true","145.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has been a true joy to watch this game grow from the core mechanics into what it is now.\n\nI will not say that the game is complete or necessarily good. There is a lot of content still to implement, features to add and polish to be put in, but as it stands, Stonehearth is playable and offers several hours worth of gameplay in its current state. Given the price of almost $30, I would not recommend buying it unless you want into the early access system. The game does not, currently, have $30 worth of content.\n\nIn spite of that, I do strongly recommend this game, both now and most likely when it leaves early access. The team is dedicated and communication is open and transparent. The game's modability is very good and new content rolls out every few weeks, showing that development is definitely active and lively.","June 15, 2015","true","9.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

One major issue I have problems with is after about 30 minutes of game time it slows down and starts lagging. I'm not sure of the reason for this, I assume it's because it's loading more of the map into RAM as I explore. So i find that the more of the map I explore the slower the game becomes until it's basically unplayable.

You have accomodation, a few farms and traps and a small military squad to fend off invaders.\nFrom that point onward it is literally just wathing your villagers eat and sleep.\n\nIf the devs would add more content this would definitely be a recommendation.

Here are the pros and cons, pros run well (most of the time) the animals and people are cute looking, you can get a lot of people(I got at least twenty eight in the alpha) there is a lot of exploring and the goblins look ridiculous. Cons (everyone likes these) :steammocking: after your town gets bigger it starts lagging more, the goblin raids can be devastating and I think there needs to be more weapons.

It already had a lot of special features before, giving you the feeling to play Minecraft inside visuals that reminded me of Final Fantasy tactics... and not only the beautiful Indie graphic style, but the whole job system reminded me that game I loved. And then the combat update (alpha 16) just bring the game to a whole new level. There's a story line, a scenario where clans of orcs and goblins will come and try to take you out after offering you to pay tribute or be killed. You have the choice. This is an open-world-Indie-RPG-sandbox-Minecraft-style-realtime-strategy game that is definitely worth trying ! You can choose to explore and fight in almost non-stop action or choose the peaceful mode or just hit the pause button while you design slowly a whole civilization block by block with all the details you want to add. You can dig your hole through the mountain and keep hiding there or just build the biggest castle in the middle of a big lake with bridges and secret tunels... it's all up to you!

You start out with a handfull of "Hearthlings" to start out your village. By making buildings, gathering food, getting wealth, and keeping moral you can grow your population. I have been playing this on and off for the past year or so and have seen some great improvements from the devs and can't wait to see what is coming in the future. You kind of have to be in the right mood to play this game; sort of in a relaxed, animated fantasy sort of mood. But I suppose you kind of have to be in the right mood to play any game.\n\nToday, I'm going to break the mold and start with cons:\n\n-It's still in alpha. There are some bugs yet and I have found some in various parts of the game.\n-There isn't much of an end game. (That I know of)\n-the bugs that are fixed cometimes create new bugs.\n\nPros:\n-The building aspect offers some cusomization with custom floor plan, building material, and a bit on roof design.\n-Depending on which job you give your Hearthling, they will progress in levels and you can promote them to an advanced job or let them increase their level at the current job and be more productive.\n-You have hard mode which offers a big challenge to your management with planning and managing.\n-The devs are very active and take in feedback and bug reports and fix them within a few weeks.\n-The devs also keep regular updates in blogs every other (or every) Tuesday about what's going on and near future plans.\n-I enjoy the cartoony art style. The Hearthlings are cute and the monsters are kind of ugly but in a cartoon, funny kind of way.\n-There is a job tree with various different jobs to give your villagers which is still in progress but improving with every alpha release.\n\nHope this helps.","May 25","true","38.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

You see the list builds there only 4 options and want to make a better build so making it and guess what u want to remove a piece because it looks or mistake (this part already placed were u dont want to undo) guess what can't and forced to deal with it or remove the whole building build it again.

To mention a few:\n\n- 64-bit lags my PC up, have to force it to 32-bit\n- Music is stuck on combat for some reason\n- In-game bugs, AI faults etc.\n- I have a 'random' crash approximately half an hour into the game almost regularly now\n- Several GUI errors, clicks don't go where you want them etc\n\nI really like it, and if these errors were weede out, it would be a much better gaming experience...

I am very impressed from playing so far (Alpha v11), yes there are bugs which can be game breaking and there is so much more that needs to be added, but this really has the beginnings of a good game. I've done a couple of play throughs and am getting the hang of managing the little town and it is very addictive. At the moment there is a bit of a lack of things to do at the later stages of the game, mining for minerals has only recently been added and beyond upgrading gear doesn't seem to have much purpose, but I'm sure more will be added.\n\nOf course, it is still in Alpha so there are many issues that can be annoying, the AI of your workers can be poor at times and they can just get stuck doing nothing. I think it would really benefit this game to allow some control over individual workers, or at least allow some prioritization of tasks because at the moment it is a bit frustrating when for example you want a worker to pick something up that he's stood next to but he just doesn't do it.\n\nThese bugs aside the game is very promising and I will certainly be following its development closely. If bugs annoy you then I would wait for the retail version. If, like me, you like the look of the game and can't wait, then I don't think you'll be disappointed.","September 9, 2015","true","42.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

But they they just leave it behind fastforwarding or use using normal speed 15 days later barly any thing is in storage I got the space but more than 7/8 is not in storage.\n\n2nd issue process of making custom building. You see the list builds there only 4 options and want to make a better build so making it and guess what u want to remove a piece because it looks or mistake (this part already placed were u dont want to undo) guess what can't and forced to deal with it or remove the whole building build it again. Part 2 of 2nd issue Okay everythings done you have just finished build but wait a sec weres the finish build button aprently the game doest want the keep the button hay game make sure that button is always avliable.\n\n3rd building there are 2 issues in building that seen constintly they build it but then won't build it even though i haven't pause(and of course this is after days of waiting) then forced to cancel it and rebuild it again. The part 2 of 3rd issue is that when they build they put up those ladders and wooden platforms right and they dont remove it so i got a build with stuff that i cant even remove.\n\nThis is after 14.7 hours of game time and this issues i've encontered so far the game crashing seems to be a issue also but its not to constint.

The art and play style are very endearing very quickly, and it's a good way to spend a few hours relaxing. My only real complaint is that ATM, it's somewhat limited and repetitive. I hope to eventually see some greater variety in building types, not just living and eating spaces, and maybe some more goals you have to meet in order to gain your next villager.

Only hope at that point is to start a new game or have a village that looks half abandoned.\n\nSo it's all inconvenient\n\nWhen the game actually works, it works well, but until it's updated futher it's not really something I'd reccomend, the games description and screenshots hype it up a lot more than it needs to be, as do the reviews.

If you're a fan of games like Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, or even Towns (or what you had hoped Towns would become), Stonehearth may leave you wanting for a bit more control over your individials and their priorities, or just the allotment of work between citizens.\n\nI hope to see Stonehearth grow bigger and stronger, particularly with things like Seasons, expanded climates and map varieties, and some additional aesthetic content, but that's no reason to not pick up a copy and try it out for yourself.

It is way over priced at $24.99 for what you get in return.  The game is fantastic up to the point where you get numerous engine error messages.  The game completely freezes up after about 60-90 minutes of play.  No crashing, game just pretty much stops.  Now you can either check on the game every 10 -15 minutes and see if any of the people have moved or start a new game.  Starting a new game just puts you back into the position of having the same freezing game problem in another 60-90 minutes.  I have played on the 11 build and the 12 build version and the freezing problem happens on both vesions.  Hope this will get fixed so the game is playable rather than the DEVS adding in more content.  The portion of the game that I could play was really great, would just like to be able to actually play it longer and see what the people can actually do.\n\nThis is not on my end as I run an AMD FX 8350  Eight Core Processor   4 GHz  8 GB Ram   64 Bit Operating System  Win 10.

You have the ability to 'finish' a game in a few hours, wherein you can unlock everything and have little left to do, then have the opportunity to go nuts!\nThe extent of my current accomplishments (before the game crashed in previous updates) was to build a town of ~30 people over 5-6hours (2 of which I walked away and did housework and listened to the music for when I should give input).\nThey had half the world covered in a "To-Be-Mined" segment, a backlog of items to be created by the individual proffessions, and frankly more money than Bill Gates.\n\nFrom there I took the minecraft approach and figured "Well lookie here, I have 4bazillion gazillion stone... ... ...Lets build a castle of such complexity and awe that god himself shall be impressed with what I can do in 7 days."\nAnd so i did! The people kept on peopleing, and I kept on creating, and by the end I had a metropolis that noone even really lived in cause they were to busy building my metropolis bigger!\n\nIf you have the ability to think of this like Minecraft, then you will realise half the fun is when your production seems to overcome your output.

Style is great, idea is great and gameplay is good. Bug squishing is pretty good (with interim updates for bug fixes between major updates)\nProgress?\nNot so good. Months can pass and then the new features added can be a little underwhelming - but they are still added.\nTo even compare this to DF - even with the suffix "lite" is a stretch at the moment.\n\nIn the genre of indirect control build agent or abstract build agent games, Stonehearth is pretty well known\n\nIn terms of gameplay depth and features it's still a long way off Gnomoria, TImber and Stone, Prison Architect, Banished, Rimworld etc never mind DF.\n\nBut slowly (oh so slowly) it is getting there, and along with Clockwork Empires - might be the best of the "abstract build agent" games yet - in 2019 or thereabouts.\n\nThumbs up for now.

Not only have the stability improved but some more content has been added and you can really see the long gameplay to take shape.

I purchased it shortly after it's EA release and it had heavy AI flaws and problematic controls. I thought to myself, "Give it some time." Some time has passed, and I'm still encountering the same bugs as before.\n\nWhenever I try to design an advanced building, using all the tools available, workers won't start build it. It seems some combinations of walls, items or whatever are just not possible, even if the tools allow it in the building menue. Sometimes they start digging the ground out, but then they just stop. Even loading the savefile or restarting the game doesn't solve the problem.\n\nSometimes the people at the workbenches just won't do their job. There is a log on the bench, there is work to be done, but they won't do anything. These bugs are stoping the game in its function, are very frustrating and happen pretty frequently.\n\nMaybe it's just something with my system (I doubt it), but I guess it's simply not really ready to be played yet. You can buy it to support the developers and try it for yourself, but I honestly would suggest: Wait.\n\nEDIT - 25.01.16\n\nI gave it another shot and I'm still encountering the same problems. I can't get passed the first two houses for my seddlers, because they just won't start building them.

It's a really fun game, but bugs bugs bugs bugs. I crashed 3 times in one hour, that's 3 resets of progress.\n\nThe UI have problems of the last century: key leaking -- if you press a key that have a binding when you are typing text, that binded function gets triggered. For example numeral key 1 2 and 3 are for game speed, so everytime you enter a number with 1, 2 or 3 in it the game speed changes. This should simply never happen anymore. What kind of idiot does that?\n\nAI is stupid. My blacksmith insists on putting ingots on the ground despite there's a crate next to him that only accepts metal.\n\nTo be honest at this time I simply doubt the developers have what it takes to make it right, because if you have these types of error, it's typically the code underlying is a mess.

It should just be used to allow easy modding. Their use of it is the main problem, it seriously limits the performance capabilities of the game.\n\nThere are many other problems now that they can solve easily. Such as building editor and then the engine that gets the 'hearthlings' to build. From my understaning, they are already working on this. But progress is slow, and instead of concentrating on important issues such as this, they instead release updates that add useless hats (which are nice but not a priority).\n\nIf they reduce their dependency on LUA and improve performance, I would be inclined to change my review.

What these reviewers meant by "Metroidvania" was true in only the barest sense: get new weaponry -> use to open path to next boss.","February 27","true","8.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

So far I've really enjoyed it. I think it really has the potential to become a very good game as development continues.\n\nThe game looks great, has good replayability, and looks to be frequently updated. I love that there's a building designer! The crafting is good so far as well.\n\nThe downside is that it's early access which means there are a lot of bugs, some of which require you to start a new game due to their severity (but the game is so replayable that it's not that big of a deal right now) and there are features that are not finished or not implemented yet. The UI is also a little clunky and there are some quality of life features I would desperately like to see rolled out soon.\n\nI would definitely recommend if you don't mind early access and bugs!\n\n\n","July 13, 2015","true","8.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is by it's self at this stage not much better or worse than any other, but it does have dedicated devs on its side. It will like most games in Early Access, be given as much love as possible and with a positive community behind it will grown into something great.\n\nThe newest build release adds a lot of fixes and features to the game and is beggining to pad it out. With the addition of the cook we finaly see some end food processing. We need to continue to play these build and find the bugs, this will make the game a better product between patches. Bug fixes and staility issues continue to be worked on. I would like to see in the next patch a build that really helps the late game lag issues. As i do notice from 14 plus people in my village it becomes to slow down a little. The most i have been able to get to without it beocming unplayable is 22/23, and i would like to reach a lot higher.\n\nI love the style and game play. and i like the new inventory and character sheet system. The devs are listening to the players and are revolveing the game not only around their concept and ideas but the players ideas for changing and improving. The best thing about a game in early access is the fact the devs can actually to do this. As well as this some of the better finihsed games out of early access have done just that, listened to the players.\n\nReally looking forward to the progression of the game. At present i do recommend it even in its early access stage. Get involved by playing and chat to the community, they are great.\n\nPlease not that there are still lots of bugs and issues with the game. I would definitely watch a Lets Play on Youtube or watch a broadcast before buying. Other than that have fun :)","July 16, 2015","true","18.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is a fantastic little game. I can tell it still needs some work, but so far, pretty fun.\nThings I wish were better:\n-The camera is a little awkward, and I wish I could get on a power perspective to the ground sometimes, since the animations and art are so damned cute, it would be nice to be a little closer to the inhabitants.\n----It would almost be worth it to have a 'walk around' mode, where you can 'be' one of the characters\n-When you have a blueprint for a building, and don't build exactly the required item for your specified blueprint there is no way of knowing, and the workers will not override one door for another, and if you decided to manually place items into the build, the ghosty blueprint remains\n-Items like fences don't 'auto complete' the way I wish they would, and leave gaps\n-I wish you could follow around a specific character, and their overlay wouldn't cover up the entire screen.\n\nAnyway...that is what I noticed so far....I will be building adorable little towns soon...and I am sure I will find little irksome quirks.

If you're a fan of games like Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, or even Towns (or what you had hoped Towns would become), Stonehearth may leave you wanting for a bit more control over your individials and their priorities, or just the allotment of work between citizens.\n\nI hope to see Stonehearth grow bigger and stronger, particularly with things like Seasons, expanded climates and map varieties, and some additional aesthetic content, but that's no reason to not pick up a copy and try it out for yourself. Stonehearth has got a solid foundation, a history of active and attentive devs, and a bright future ahead.","June 3, 2015","true","20.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I purchased it shortly after it's EA release and it had heavy AI flaws and problematic controls. I thought to myself, "Give it some time." Some time has passed, and I'm still encountering the same bugs as before.\n\nWhenever I try to design an advanced building, using all the tools available, workers won't start build it. It seems some combinations of walls, items or whatever are just not possible, even if the tools allow it in the building menue. Sometimes they start digging the ground out, but then they just stop. Even loading the savefile or restarting the game doesn't solve the problem.\n\nSometimes the people at the workbenches just won't do their job. There is a log on the bench, there is work to be done, but they won't do anything. These bugs are stoping the game in its function, are very frustrating and happen pretty frequently.\n\nMaybe it's just something with my system (I doubt it), but I guess it's simply not really ready to be played yet. You can buy it to support the developers and try it for yourself, but I honestly would suggest: Wait.\n\nEDIT - 25.01.16\n\nI gave it another shot and I'm still encountering the same problems. I can't get passed the first two houses for my seddlers, because they just won't start building them.

Style is great, idea is great and gameplay is good. Bug squishing is pretty good (with interim updates for bug fixes between major updates)\nProgress?\nNot so good. Months can pass and then the new features added can be a little underwhelming - but they are still added.\nTo even compare this to DF - even with the suffix "lite" is a stretch at the moment.\n\nIn the genre of indirect control build agent or abstract build agent games, Stonehearth is pretty well known\n\nIn terms of gameplay depth and features it's still a long way off Gnomoria, TImber and Stone, Prison Architect, Banished, Rimworld etc never mind DF.\n\nBut slowly (oh so slowly) it is getting there, and along with Clockwork Empires - might be the best of the "abstract build agent" games yet - in 2019 or thereabouts.\n\nThumbs up for now.

They had really improved the game a lot. Much more stable, so far after these months I haven't had a single crash or save that had to be abandoned. Not only have the stability improved but some more content has been added and you can really see the long gameplay to take shape. There is still much more to be done but so far the developers have proved to me that they are working hard and they well deserved the money I droped for this game.

It is way over priced at $24.99 for what you get in return.  The game is fantastic up to the point where you get numerous engine error messages.  The game completely freezes up after about 60-90 minutes of play.  No crashing, game just pretty much stops.  Now you can either check on the game every 10 -15 minutes and see if any of the people have moved or start a new game.  Starting a new game just puts you back into the position of having the same freezing game problem in another 60-90 minutes.  I have played on the 11 build and the 12 build version and the freezing problem happens on both vesions.  Hope this will get fixed so the game is playable rather than the DEVS adding in more content.  The portion of the game that I could play was really great, would just like to be able to actually play it longer and see what the people can actually do.\n\nThis is not on my end as I run an AMD FX 8350  Eight Core Processor   4 GHz  8 GB Ram   64 Bit Operating System  Win 10.

You have the ability to 'finish' a game in a few hours, wherein you can unlock everything and have little left to do, then have the opportunity to go nuts!\nThe extent of my current accomplishments (before the game crashed in previous updates) was to build a town of ~30 people over 5-6hours (2 of which I walked away and did housework and listened to the music for when I should give input).\nThey had half the world covered in a "To-Be-Mined" segment, a backlog of items to be created by the individual proffessions, and frankly more money than Bill Gates.\n\nFrom there I took the minecraft approach and figured "Well lookie here, I have 4bazillion gazillion stone... ... ...Lets build a castle of such complexity and awe that god himself shall be impressed with what I can do in 7 days."\nAnd so i did! The people kept on peopleing, and I kept on creating, and by the end I had a metropolis that noone even really lived in cause they were to busy building my metropolis bigger!\n\nIf you have the ability to think of this like Minecraft, then you will realise half the fun is when your production seems to overcome your output. Then you get bored and build, and build, and BUILD!\n\n*Edit: Oh, and normally I will finish a game, then wait for the next update, then feel special getting to play the next alpha and have a reason for a new game :-D","November 12, 2015","true","100.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

If you're a fan of games like Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, or even Towns (or what you had hoped Towns would become), Stonehearth may leave you wanting for a bit more control over your individials and their priorities, or just the allotment of work between citizens.\n\nI hope to see Stonehearth grow bigger and stronger, particularly with things like Seasons, expanded climates and map varieties, and some additional aesthetic content, but that's no reason to not pick up a copy and try it out for yourself.

(It is not MP right now to be clear.)\n\nI'm an EA who ore but this is one of the ones I would recommend with no reservations.\n\nIn the game you plop down a group of curated settlers in a hospitable or inhospitable landscape and have a solid town building survival experience.  Give Hearthlings jobs and watch as they level up, then you can promote them into higher tier professions.  With awesome mods like Candledark you can really add some variety to your game.

That said, heed the "Early Access" warnings. This is most certainly alpha quality software. That's not to imply that the game crashes often but there are a lot of kinks to be worked out in the gameplay. In about 2 hours of play, I encountered significant issues -- hearthlings spawning under water and unable to exit, default buildings with no doors, in progress buildings with "confused" workers that never seem to finish the job, an in-progress teardown of a building that left four hearthlings permanently trapped inside.

OSX/Linux versions are on the backburner and may never come yet they were one of the first stretch goals.\n\nThe game itself is hardly what I would call playable. Here's a list of the many things that go wrong:\n* Construction of buildings stalls. This means they never complete a building, which is a pretty important aspect.\n* Villagers consistently fail on their tasks meaning you have to re-task them. Again, and again, and again.\n\nAnd of course at one point in the game the AI just stops.\n\nI do not recommend the game as early access.

Things that are in the game work well and good (until you meet bugs), and the whole process of managing your town is quite smooth and nice, easily the best or near-best of that I've seen in similar games.\n\nSo, why it's "not recommended"?\n\nAt the moment, there isn't much to do there. The amount of content that you can try is extremely low, vertical progression is basically nonexistent - you can unlock all the things that are currently implemented in the game in 2 to 3 game days (that's 1-1.5 hours of playtime at most), and afterwards there's nothing left to do apart from "build more stuff because you can and it's the only thing you can".\n\nAdditonal grain of salt is the building editor - customizable buildings is one of the defining points of the game (that is, one of the defining points that is actually implemented right now), but the editor is rather clunky and hard to use in cases other than traditional 1-story building (multiple stories aren't implemented at the moment) with simple inner structure and minimal amount of walls. Try to do complex multi-room irregurarly-shaped buildings, however, and you will be fighting the UI much more than actually planning.\n\nAnd finally, the pacing of development is nothing to write home about. The initial plans (from Kickstarter campaign) were to release the game towards the end of 2014, you know. Now it's the end of 2015, and we recently had an alpha version where devs were mostly fixing internals, such as pathfinding. Going by this, it is extremely unlikely that we'll see any reasonably-sized chunk of gameplay - that is, content and actual mechanics - available until the end of 2016, and beta/release stages may follow even later. And that's only if the development won't stop abruptly at some point.\n\nTo summarize, it's a game that promises really great things, but currently allows you to plant turnips, design and build simple small buildings, dig through mountains, and hit randomly-appearing enemies such as goblins with some swords (archery is not implemented yet).

After I first installed it, I could start the game und play my first round, but after like 2 hours the game started heavily lagging and after I restarted the game it always brings up an error message and I can't play anymore. I really expected more for an early access game that costs over 20€!!!\n\nSo here are a few things I can tell about the game:\n+ The building system is very interesting. You have a managing system where you generate a building and then the little fellows start build it. You don't have to worry about that anymore as long as you have enough ressources. Even the scaffolding is made by their own.\n+ The job managing is also very simple. You have a good overview over the little fellows and which jobs they are doing. Some of the jobs have a question mark, but I guess they will be implemented over time since this is game is still in developing.\n+ Ah! Finally there is a game where you know what you have to do to get new citizens :D So every morning there appears a message which shows your food, wealth and a third thing which I stupidly forgot :P If you reach the value for the new citizen you can directly accept or decline it and he will automatically enter your town.\n\n- Mining into a mountain can be a bit annoying since the control is a bit buggy or maybe I did it the wrong way. Anyway I had to zoom with the camera to the ground and then follow the path through the mountain to select a new area to mine. If I go a little bit to far left or right I'm hanging in the mountain and I have to zoom out and do the same again.\n- Many bugs and errors which make the game unplayable, like the lagging or the error message which doesn't let my play again.\n\nNevertheless while I managed to play the game it was really good. Since I'm a fan of the survival/building/crafting genre I really hope that this game will be playable within the next patch again. I have high expections in this game and I really want to see what the next patches are bringing.","December 9, 2015","false","16.4"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

Unfortunately this game is so rough, with so many bugs, that it's just too frustrating to play at the moment.\n\nEven primary mechanics such as building are broken (you have to access the console and type a code, just to remove a block) and the menus, of which there are too many, are a confusing and convoluted mess (when you switch to the next tab, the previous one will remain open, even though it's redundant now). There's no master delete button, so lots of menus hide their relevant remove/delete/undo functions somewhere within them, which is different for each individual task or item. You would have to play a ton of hours to remember where they all are, so you spend a lot of time clicking around in order to perform what should be very basic, simple funtions. Every ten or fifteen minutes an error will also pop up on screen, but most of the time I have no idea what they mean.\n\nLastly, that addictive hook that most creative games have isn't quite there yet. I don't think the game does a good job of showing off it's best assets, ideas and goals. It doesn't nudge you towards it's strengths in the way that even minimalist games like Minecraft manage to do.\n\nI'd hold off for now if I was you.

Poorly optimized, pathing needs a lot of help, and guards cant use ladders. Over all I like the style of the game, BUT in its current state I would hold off on getting this. If you want something more optimized I would say take a look at RimWorld. When I say its not optimized I mean when you get to around 12-14 villagers the game starts lagging bad. (dont start saying I have a bad rig, 16gig ram 1Tera SSD 7950ATI card and 8 core 4.2ghz cpu) Most of the class's arnt in the game and about 25% of the skills for the class's that are there dont work. The game itself is easy going but when your village gets up in size everything slows down. I cant even get them to make a wall. Ive been waiting over 5 hrs for them to hang 2 doors. Give this game some time to flush out everything. Should be good if they fix the bugs(there is a lot of them atm) and do some real optimization.","July 26, 2015","false","14.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

I'm sad that I did.\n\nI like the defence/survival element of Stonehearth, where camps of enemies will spawn around the map and periodically attack your settlement, you can either attack them early and risk your guards, or just wait out the attacks for the XP. There are also loot boxes and such around the map to be discovered, usually guarded by some mini-boss creatures. That part they did right, it's fun.\n\nFor a game that's been in development for such a long time, I really wonder why there are so many bugs. I understand it's a early access game, but that's not really an excuse for the really terrible building mechanics. It's a city-builder game, if i was developing a city builder, the first thing i'd get sorted would be the building mechanics, at the moment they're extremely frustrating and unintuitive. You have no ability to change things once you've placed them, so if you want to extend your wall out by 2 squares, you need to undo everything you've done to get back there. This is really frustrating when building and planning complex structures.\n\nI'd like to see defensive walls (properly) added, or at least the ability to create stand-alone walls outside of the custom structure editor, for a simple project like a perimeter wall the player shouldn't be forced to stuff around too much. I noticed also that it's very clumbsy at sticking to things. i tried to incorporate a pre-existing structure in my town into the wall, instead the custom structure editor decided that the sections of wall touching that building now belonged to it, and not my wall, so the only way to get rid of those walls was to destroy that building. Annoying to say the least.\n\nAlong with numerous bugs that caused my workers to get stuck on window ledges, placing objects is a real pain. I've been forced to build a cobblestone fence piece-by-piece because if i try to place more than one at a time, the workers freak out and wont complete the task.\n\nAt this point I can't reccommend the game, I feel like I was ripped off, to be honest.","March 28","false","42.0"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

On the other hand when you want to compare graphics to anything other, i would say best comparision would be... Minecraft. Yup. But i really do not found it as an odd... Rather, it was kind of funny like for me.\n\nSo you do not played none of those?\n\nWell, This game is based on developing small village, with couple "Earthlings" droped somewhere on the wild, to survive, and build prosperous village... Or town. It depends only on you, there is not limits on building size, shape or really anythin'! Free your mind, and construct your own city of dreams!\n\n2) AI\n\nSo... How does AI works? Well... It was surprisly good. I expected a little more problems with movment, and decision makin', but it really went smooth and wise. But not whole the time. Earthlings, sometimes decide to go mad, and run away from village, or dive into water, just to... idk... Well. Depends on their humour! I spotted problems with warriors, wich sometimes decide to walk around crops, and ignore attackers, wich goes rampage inside my village. That was REALLY anoying after all... But if you get used to, and understan algoryth of their decision makin', u are able to predict, what they will do in certain moments, so it doesnt't bother me so much in later stages of game.\n\n3) Level up mechanics.\n\nIn game we got Couple intrestin' things. For example, every Earthling got "statistics, wich let you choose what each Earthling should do as his proffesion. Unfortunatly it is a little unclear, and hard to guess how it works, because dev's, does not care about "obviousness" of his game.\n\nBut on my own experiance i already found this things:\n\nWisdom (mind): Let's you Earthling level up faster!\nBody: Let's your Earthling move faster, or endure more hits from enemies!\nSpirit: Kind of useless statistic, Shows how much "trust" does you Earthling have, and hwo fast he will scatter from formation,\n\nWhat does level up's of Eartlings gives? Well. their abilities, and further jobs higly depends on their level, so do efficientcy. Well. Mostly that is all.\n\n4) Is it easy to control everything?\n\nYes, ofcurse! or at least i'd like to say so. It is really hard to control movement of your Earthlings, because u got actually no control over them at all! they just move and do things as they please, even if that means that they do not "want", and just stay and watch the ground for a god's sake!\n\nWhat's more anoying, there is not option to dig vertical tunnels, and that is annoying as hell! What does it mean? Well. That means 2 things.\n\n1| You can not dig upward.\n2| You can not dig downward.\n\nSecond one is actually not true, you can dig downward, but it is really anoyin', cuz u have to dig level, by level, u can not dig to certain depth. Anoyin'. REALLY anoyin'.\n\n5) Okay, so we know that it needs skill to control you workers, but what about buildings?\n\nOh, That is the part wich is most important! Buidlings! This game is mostly 'bout this! Annnnnnd it's gone.\nCertainly. This functionality of game is most important and so it got's tons of bugs. TONS of TONS. Actuually at present version of the game, it is impossieble to construct you own building... Otherrwise it will most likely crash. Daemn. ;-;\n\n2016-03-06\n\nI see lil correction on that point. They are hard working on making it better.\n\n6) Okay. So what 'bout interface?\n\nOh! that's the easy part! But still crashes every 6/7 minutes when you Earthling get's stuck. Well. It is not right.\n\n7) But what 'bout interface project?\n\nPoor. That is only thing I cna say about this interface. It is totally not thought well. It is like taking 10 kg water canister just to pee. Why do I have to do it?!\n\nThat is what you are thinkin' while playin' this game. Custom binds, does not exist, and you havbe to use long routes to get to certain point. Sad.\n\n8)My overall opinion?\n\nI really like this game, and gonna keep playin' it, but I advice everyone who is readin' this, to do following thin:\n\nTurn on youtube.\ntype: "Lets play StoneHearth".\n\nWell. I Change my opinion, from "It is shiat" to "Can be", but Still not worth 20 bucks.\n\n10)Great Final.\n\nHave I spoted problem that makes this game unplayable?\n\n(2016-03-21)\nNo. It is really enjoyable at this point. But problem is that you can not remove structures or control your earthlings fully... But it is great step forth.\n\n\n\n\nOverall overall.\n\nWell, at start, here you could find tons of acid... but now I kind of find dev's as going in right place. Still.\n\nI will not say it is worth 20$...\n\nNot bad. Well improved, dev's\n~~Black\n\nEdited:\n2016-01-23\nThanks to GreenDragonHart for pointin' out and askin' to update review\n-Corrected typos, and deleted patch crin'\n2016-03-06\n-Corrected part with "no updates" issues.\n-Couple of updates in short term happen.\n2016-05-06\n-Corrected typos\n-Changed the Overall, and Ram monster part.","January 16","false","12.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","46","6","13","4","2"

This game has simply reaffirmed my convictions in this matter.\n\nThis is not to say that this game is terrible - it's not. It has potential, and there are a lot of good things about it. It has cute animations, enchanting music, and a nice crisp graphic style (although I must admit that the minecraft-esque aesthetic is getting a little old at this point).\n\nAs for how it plays, it is a minecraft derivative (not necessarily a bad thing), though instead of building and defending your settlement by yourself, you must order AI-controlled peons to do it for you. This would seem to be an excellent premise on paper, and sometimes it works beautifully. Watching your peons work, collect, harvest, eat, sleep and fulfill their tasks is sometimes very rewarding.\n\nHowever, in many other ways, this game leaves something to be desired. The UI is confusing, tutorials are nonexistent, the camera controls are clunky, the building tools are even clunkier, and the minion AI is so glitchy that they will fail to build even the simplest of structures. Even the basic building designs that are shipped with the game will be left incomplete by your peons once they start building - even if they have all of the materials available. This forces you to scrap those structures and attempt to rebuild them again, and of course there's no guarantee that your peons will actually finish them the second time they try.\n\nOther crippling bugs include peons who will simply freeze in place and refuse to move. Even when they become exhausted and start to starve, they won't move even to help themselves. The only way I've found to fix this is to reassign them to another job, but in doing so, they lose all of their accumulated levels. Not fun!\n\nIssues like these are a bit concerning, considering that the game is over halfway through Early Access by now. But even with the bugs aside, Stonehearth seems to be sorely lacking in content. The plain, empty expanses of the landscape really aren't very stimulating, and there's very little to do out there. Once you get your settlement up and running (and it's not hard to do), you will simply repel invader attacks over and over again, collect whatever loot they drop, and continue to farm your crops.\n\nThis might actually be fun if the inventory management was enjoyable, but it's not. You can't really manipulate the objects in-game directly, so you have to rely on your peons to manage and care for the plethora of items that you will craft and collect. Usually this means that they will throw them into an unsorted jumble within your stockpile; other times, they will squirrel it away in crates and boxes, and if you have more than one, it will be anyone's guess as to which one they've put it in. If one of your items is missing and you can't seem to track it down, good luck finding it!\n\nStonehearth gave me a few moments of fun within the hours that I played it, but mostly I just felt bored and frustrated. It's a shame, because I really like the idea behind it. I may revisit it once it leaves Early Access, but if what I've seen is indicative of the final product, I could probably take it or leave it.\n\nThe good news is that the developers are providing regular updates, and are obviously very dedicated to this project. It should improve over time. I really hope it does.","February 9","false","3.1"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","6","13","2","0"

I bought this game before it hit steam, for $30 USD.

They reponded back by saying there was a post on their website telling people it would release on steam for cheaper. Thinking to myself that i was an idiot and feeling kind of down, i let my friend know about what had happened, he went on the website and found out that they had actually created that post AFTER the date in which i bought the game, and lied about it.

Almost everthing they have done with the game is perfect. The art design, music, and the UI are all really good. There are a few down sides that are game breaking though. 1. The game has been in alpha for a long time, sure updates have been coming out but not as often as you would like. 2. The really bad thing about this game is that when you jump right in, it doesnt take long for you to realize that there are some really serious and obvious game breaking bugs. A really big bug that ruins this game for me is the entire User Interface disapearing like a fart in the wind. You start clicking buttons and moving your mouse in hopes that it returns... but it never does. You can still hear the action sounds of menues opening a closing. Another terrible bug that can just make you want to rip your hair out is the view hotkeys that allow you to view through buildings and even the ground. Sometimes once you have pressed that hotkey you're stuck in that view and you can't see anything. You can keep pressing the hotkey again but nothing usually happens. If you really want to pay to be a betta tester then go ahead and get the game, but just remember these bugs may never get fixed and the game may never be completely finished.","September 17, 2015","false","44.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

This summer will be the end of the third year (going on the 4th) since this game has been in development. To say the progress has been slow would be an understatement. Triple A games take less time to develop than this has and it is still far away from release. Very little content because so much time has been spent constantly fixing things that should have been fixed in the early alpha's.\n\nA lot of the bugs have been with this game since Alpha 1. Especially with AI. They have fixed AI building at least 3 or 4 times and it still doesn't work right. They have to keep going back and rewriting code over and over again.\n\nThey are nice developers but watching this game being developed has been amatuer hour. I was really into this game the first year watching all the dev streams and such but then it became obvious that it was going to be one of the longest development cycles in the history of gaming and I lost interest. Here it is - March of 2016 and they just had another stage of Alpha dedicated totally to bug fixing and fixing AI - Again!\n\nThis game is very charming and the music is top notch.

Originally, I bought this around the time I was playing Towns, and liked the idea that it was graphically superior to Towns and had a few more features in planning. Many features were still in development, but I don't mind supporting independent developers. Skip forward some months, and the problems inherent to this kind of development become self-evident. Even easy-concept games can be a nightmare when you start adding in features.\n\nWhile the community is very strong and supportive, the developers communicate frequently and consistently, the game itself is fundamentally flawed. Gameplay is only tenable for about 12 hours, from there it's the same thing in a new setting. At the moment, many core features of the game are either uninteresting or broken. The engine itself is unsustainable or poorly written. AI still breaks itself after enough time has passed (or becomes so inept at tasks they become useless). Town areas are by default limited to 20 citizens, because the engine really can't handle much more than that. The map bogs down after about 10 in-game days with very little activity (2 gb ram and 16% of a decent quad-core processor on PAUSE).\n\nIf you're looking to purchase this game, wait. See if the developers iron out the bugs, but even then know that it's likely not going to be a game you're going to come back to or play for too long. It'll be something casual when you've got nothing else to do - download, install, play, get bored and repeat in a couple months.\n\nPros:\n- Good looking UI and general landscape - blocky but tastefully done.\n- Good conceptual design of core elements.\n- Good balance between difficulty vs. reward - easy enough for new players, but can't immediately make everything.\n- Consistent small updates, if a little slow for what the updates usually are.\n- Consistent and constructive communication from developers and community.\n- Implemented crash reporting that actually means something will get fixed eventually.\n\nCons:\n- AI bogs very quickly.\n- Processor hungry for package size.\n- Gameplay can get repetitive (not talking about unimplemented features).\n- Spend much time after initial rush just watching your citizens do things.\n- Buggy as hell, but to be expected in Alpha.\n- Gameplay is geared to non-expansion - there's no reason to really expand much beyond starting area. Just pick a good one and wall yourself in.\n- Gameplay itself is very short. When you've done it once, it's the same thing on a different map.\n\ntl;dr:\nWait a while if you're following this game. It's buggy and VERY casual. Devs are slow, but do communicate.","April 23","false","91.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The crafting system is very simple and easy to learn, while still being of a good size for this early on in development. The raids on your town can be very simple and easy to fend off, to brutal cavity defiling, child sodomising, soul endingly devastating. So always make sure you have a Fighter or two ASAP. Focus on getting them better equipment over getting your next crafting milestone. Your people can live on without a Trapper for a few more weeks. They won't be living if a horde of goblins kill your Defenders and then your people because all they have for equipment is still padded armor and wooden sword and shield.\n\n\nThis game is very much still in progress but I like the progress thats being done. Most games in early access that say they are still in Alpha (Which this one tells you it is right at the start) have half the content, and 1,000 times more bugs and crashes. All this has that I've noticed so far is a couple of UI and AI bugs and logic loops, and a small tendancy for data leak. So restart your game every hour and a half or so and you will be fine. Also you have to turn on Auto Save, which was weird. Sometimes your Citizens will go to move an object you designated to be moved elsewhere and someone else will get to it sooner and that previous citizen will still go to where that object is. Though once they find out the object is there they move on to the next objective which is nice. Sometimes in Gnomoria (A finished and released game) Gnomes will do the exact same thing but instead get stuck in an AI Loop and you pretty much have to wait for them to get hungry or tired to reset themselves.\n\nSo far the majority of negative reviews about this game are about buildings not being able to get fully done. In my opinion since I have a fully functioning town with 12 buildings, 5 of which are custom design, roads, pastures, lengthy defensive works and what not, all of them 100% completed. That the complainers are idiots, and that they try to do multiple projects at one time, run out of materials and then complain that the game is broken. Much like that meme where a guy rides a bike then puts a stick in his own tire and complains about someone else doing it. Your citizens will do multiple projects at a time, and the game will tell you that you have enough resources for a building if the resources are still in your stockpile. That means that if you pause the game, and try to construct 3 houses, each time it will tell you that you have enough resources in your stockpile. If you are that tired and don't notice that logic issue, please go to sleep. Or stop being a ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\n\nA couple of suggestions that would be nice in my opinion.\n\n-Make it to where when digging a mine tunnel, they auto construct ladders, since people will sometimes forget and well there goes 3-6 of your citizens.\n\n-Possibly already in development but if there could be some sort of food preservation thing. Like an Ice box or something that will keep my fruits and veggies fresh longer would be nice.\n\n- Lower the amount of food it takes to get a new Citizen at ALL levels. I am currently sitting at 15 Citizens and producing enough food for 80. Still can't get a new Citizen. I realize this may be due to the developers wanting to give people a possible Siege supply incase they take heavy losses to Food or Food production capability from a raid, but there is an option wether or not to accept a new Citizen. Let us take the risk.\n\n-Developers. This tip more than all the others is the most important and I hope that if you read this review and take anything from it, that you take this one to the heart.\n\nGive yourselves a pat on the back, and some high fives all around. You state clearly that this game is in alpha and its already so well done. I don't particularly enjoy games like this. Gnomoria is a bore and I couldnt stand to play it for more than 30 minutes. Any other game like this that involves city management with no Army management or Cities to pillage and conquer leave me bored and moving on to another game. YOU got me to play this for 4 hours so far, and once there is more content I can happily say I will gladly add 100 hours just to explore and enjoy this finely crafted game you have made.

Highly addicting even for early access if you enjoy sandboxy games.

Very much looking forward to watching this game evolve and happy to support it.

Your "Heartlings", or "Lazylings" as how I call them, go idle after a certain point in the game. Mostly when you go above 17-20 heartlings what i've noticed the past months. They stop mining, stop collecting resources and when you want to build a new building, they build it up for a part, then stand idle for many ingame hours... As a gamer you want to make progress but this game lacks a good enough AI to let you make progress. You can only build up a little, then the AI fails. Only thing you achieve here is stress and irritation, dont pay money for that.\n\nWhen the game has a proper AI I will probably update this review.

The dev team has a lot of work to do to get the game finished, but its the dev team behind the game that makes me want to like this game. They constantly release new content that addresses mine and others issues with the game, and its progressing quickly.\n\nIn a few months I believe there will be enough substance to it to make it a really fun game. Get it only after taking a look at the devs homepage and deciding yourself if what they have planned still makes you want to buy it.

It would be great for them to fix this, but I can definately live with it. Also I think it would be great to add some more wildlife besides foxes and racoons?

Unfortunately I can not recommend it due to being unplayable for more then 5 hours on a single world, on average 3, before hitting a game/save breaking bug. I understand early access concept, I have bought over a dozen. This games abundant number of issues and slow rate of fixes make it more of a struggle in futility. If they stopped adding features and actually fixed the broken aspects I could easily recommend it. Having buildings disappear at random for close to 5 months is unacceptable. In the last 15 years I could count the numer of reviews for games that I have written on 1 hand.

While true, this game AS OF NOW is a little shoddy in some places. However, even with those problems the game remains to be a fun and enjoyable experience. The devs spend countless hours fixing bugs and moving the game forward, relesing beta updates on a weekly basis and constantly keeping the players informed, even taking in their suggestions on their dev stream and the Stonehearth forums. The game is, unlike most, being molded by not just the developers, but the players aswell. These qualities make me certain that this game will travel from the state it's in now, which is still a good game as is, to even grater heights.\n\n4/5 would recommend AS IS.\n5/5 would recommend for the future.","June 8, 2015","true","72.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The devs make excuses to some very long time game breaking bugs. If you like restarting your game every 10 to 15 minutes to make it work, or losing whole towns because of errors.. then maybe this game is for you. In its current state it is unplayable and all the devs focus on is new content without correcting the game breaking bugs. What good is new content if you can't play the game?\n\nYour town people will idle for no reason (stop working).\nThere is pathing issues that will make your town people die of hunger.\nThey will not complete buildings early in the game, this is for the simple designs forget trying to build complex buildings.\nRestarting the game every 10 to 15 minutes in hopes it corrects the issues ( and most the time it does not).\nIt will use up your ram at high velocity and spam you with error messages (got over 5k a few times on error messages).\n\nThis is just a few examples of the state of this unplayable game.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\n2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

This game has way too many game breaking bugs. It has potential but is horrible at the moment. Your world may last about an hour before the bugs start happening. If you wan this game, wait for it to update a couple of times because this version is really bad. Now, on the bright side, this game is still an ALPHA game, which means its not complete and has many more updates and bug fixes.

That's this game.\nI got suckered in by the Kickstarter, and it's been the same glitchy mess for three years.\n\nAt its core, the game wants to be a city-planning, strategy, completely customizable dream of a game with strong community support.  The problem is that, at the moment, there's very little customization, no strategy, and no real city planning.  Towns rarely last long enough to build more than a handful of homes before glitches break a save.\nThe new features that have been added over the years have been nice, but they'd be nicer if I could actually enjoy them without having to restart because of a game-breaking bug.\n\nOne of two things will happen.

The "voxelated" graphics are a poor and cliche aesthetic choice.  Progression is slow and meaningless.

Building custom buildings is near-impossible, the controls are often non-responsive, there's a nasty memory leak (this game should not require +6 gigs of RAM), and that's only the biggest problems. Workers that don't work, ladders and furniture that can't be deconstructed, etc. There's many small things that combine to make the game very hard to enjoy.\n\nPutting aside the bugs and building problems, the game is well designed. The progression of your minions is simple but effective, the resource harvesting likewise. My only quibble is that it takes a very long time to do anything with only a 2x speed option. I'd like the ability to go up to 8x at least.\n\nGiven the strength of the underlying design, I look forward to playing the game more once it's had some bug-fixing done.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lpxGamer/recommended/253250/","lpxGamer","GreenGamingFish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lpxGamer/","24 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo far, after a few of hours of play, I think the game has potential but gives me the feeling that Alpha projects like this shouldn't be "Early Access" or more so paid for. Though I feel good about the developer and hope things update often. Hopefully weekly. If I get updates often and ones that pay off like I'm used to with the Early Access games I'm currently playing, then It should be well worth it.\n\nThe art and sound all seem pretty good. More so for an Alpha... so much so that it worries me. I won't say anything bad about it... just that it seems like that energy could have been used to make better gameplay. Maybe they had more artistst durring development. I understand they have a plan and all but I'm not sure what they are going for.\n\nI'm looking at my red LUA error window, and it's up to 3000+ errors. I can sometimes still play but the window likes to pop back up a lot. I think this already exists sort of, as some kind of building error so I technically would be submitting a duplicate report... so I don't report it. Not even sure which or what of the errors I'm supposed to report.  If I could just push a button and send off a report, that would be fantastic. Alas, I have to navigate to the bug forum and search through a bunch of other existing errors to make sure mine don't already exist as posts. 3000+ of them. This just turns me off and discourages me. I came in with the concept that the game would be test-playable and easy to report problems, but that's not the case. Make it easy to report problems and a lot of that frustration goes away. I'm all for helping debug and I wouldn't have minded paying as much if there was just a little bit more attention to problem reporting detail before the Steam release. Feels bad to have to pay and do grunt work to get bugs worked out. Maybe there is a reward in it somewhere if one plays long enough. If future mod support is superior, that might make me feel better. Speculation and promises don't at this point.\n\nThe other thing that is boggling and disappointing is that the game has fully featured building elements but no way to demolish the buildings that are made. Seems like someone is missing something important. I don't know if the developers are locked in some strange dimention far away from logical game mechanics... I don't want to sound mean, but this seems very dumb even for Alpha.\n\nThe other things, like villagers not finishing buildings properly, idling when stuff could be done... I think these are already reported a few times in the "bug tracker". And most of the time I can close/open or just save and re-load and that seems to fix some weirdness and the error spams. So I got a bit of fun out of it but the problems seem to crop up frequently, killing the flow and feeling more like developer work than gameplay. It seems worth giving it time, or rather I want to feel like it's worth giving it time, but if I don't see a good bug fix in a week I'll probably have to ask for a refund. I can't recommend paying for this yet and I feel dissapointed considering what I paid.","June 7, 2015","false","83.6"," 22 of 53 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","22","53","2","8"

Currently most lot of the planned content is no where near being in which makes me question the pricing decision. Right now only 1/3rd of the intended jobs are in.\n\nDuring my five hours of gameplay I consantly ran into UI crashes and system failures, which would result in parts of the UI or game becoming unusable forcing you to reload. Twice now it has nearly crashed my pc to the point I was forced to do a false restart where the computer shuts the program down since you hit the power button but you then cancle the restart when it asks you to close your notepad. The game draws more ram then needed from your system causing sound glitches. Also combat in it can be frustraiting, having to use a badly designed party/designated area targeting system. And a warning, do NOT save when one of your characters is in direct combat, when you load the game takes a while to load the ui and seems to suddenly jump a minute or so ahead in combat, often instanly killing any non guard character without giving you the chance to react.\n\n","June 13, 2015","false","98.8"," 4 of 18 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","4","18","0","0"

It seems that the development team is going backwards each time they add a new feature.\n\n-Multi-story housing construction nearly impossible.\n-Roof construction causes severe Lua errors.\n-Almost every game I've started becomes unplayable after a few hours of gameplay.\n\nAvoid this title at the moment. I'd hardly call it Alpha.\n\n\nAlthough I would normally recomend this game, I just can't justify recomending it for now. The idea is there, and the foundation of the game is more or less built, but it seems that the developer doesn't know what they want to do.\n-Very little content. The addition of goblin packs and wolves have extended gameplay somewhat, but at best it is a bare minimum for your average game.\n-The content in game is very repetitive.\n-Extremely slow development schedule. It seems to me the developers are working on this either part time, or are severely short staffed. It can take months for systems to be completed, and usually once implemented are extremely buggy.\n-Extremely buggy. Be prepared for constant crashes and damaged saves. I'm not certain with version 10+, but every new version requires a whole new game.\n-Game is not what was advertised and has switched focus/goals. What originally was intended as a city/realm management game, has turned into a village micromanagement game.\n-Game has lost focus in that it wants a combat RTS element, but still relies on its old villager micromanagement foundation.\n\nIt's a good idea and so far a solid foundation for what could be a great game in a few years (think Kerbal Space Program).

TL:DR it is nothing like the Kickstarter pitched it would be, which might be just fine, but it isn't what I backed.\n\nOne of the first tags you will see for Stonehearth says city builder and when you see that tag do you think of something like Gnomoria or Towns? Probably not. Those are more like town or village builders with some micromanagement and customization of each individual villager, which is great because you you start with maybe half a dozen and build up from there, but even if you end up with 20 villagers (which is a lot for this game) would you say that is a city? You might argue that I'm just talking semantics and being trivial, but let me quote what the Stonehearth Kickstarter summarized the game to be, "A sandbox strategy game with town building, crafting, and epic battles!" It certainly does not have town building and crafting at the moment, but a strategy game it is not.\n\nAt the moment the game is very much like Gnomoria, Timber & Stone or Towns. You start with a few villagers, build a few structures, place stockpiles, farm, mine and craft things while also defending from random attacks from enemies. I've seen the game grow into something that has some level of polish to it and visually looks pretty good, but never has the game seemed like it could technically manage anything like an actual city. Once again, my focus is that this is meant to be a city sim with light micromanagment for people and focused more on the large picture, not the small. Like, the original explanation for multiplayer was, "Share a living world with your friends and family! Build sprawling empires of towns, cities and castles, and unite in mutual defense against the towering threat of ancient titans." There was this huge focus on building cities, castles and fighting off these big factions and threats, as a city with some level of strategy and more like a city sim mixed with a game like Dwarf Fortress. This isn't that and it has going in a direction that makes me think it will never be anything like that.\n\nIt will certainly be a good or great Dwarf Fortress, Towns, Gnomoria, style of game at some point and that is fantastic, so if you want another one of those then good, but if you were an early backer like me who wanted something with strategy and a larger scale then I think you will be vastly disappointed. I was drawn in by early screenshots of cities with over a dozen structures, a castle in the background, large statues and tons of moving citizens going about their work, and that's just not going to happen. Which is fine, but I don't want anyone else to think it is that game either.","June 3, 2015","false","11.9"," 37 of 129 people (29%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","29","37","129","2","15"

You'll chop down some trees, farm a bit, build some buildings for sleeping and then the game mostly dies off. They've just started integrating a "goblin campaign" wherein your settlement is supposed to be attacked by increasingly dangerous hordes of goblins, but I just sort of killed them all.\n\nThe game developers need to focus on how they are going to challenge the player within their simulation. Right now, that focus just isn't there. Instead, they're doing things like advanced programming to make water flow realistically, but water has precisely zero significance for gameplay. This, I believe, exemplifies why I'm concerned not just for the state of the current game, but future development as well. If the game eventually reaches a point where gameplay is enduring and well-thought out, I will gladly remove/rewrite this review.","June 3, 2015","false","27.4"," 48 of 165 people (29%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","29","48","165","6","15"

EDIT HERE 22/03/16:*\n\n"So I must edit this review as there is new ALPHA, ALPHA 15, developers fixed lot of bugs and glitches and I must say that they improved game a lot. Yes they are still really slow, but they are trying as hard as they can. In ALPHA 15 is one big change and that change is compatibility of SAVED GAMES. So yes, you can build huge city in ALPHA 15 and well well well you can continue building in ALPHA 16 and 17 and 9446421.... This is huge change for me (and for everyone else as well) so here I am going to change my review from negative to POSITIVE.\n\nGO and play this game, yes it's not so complex (yet) but it's fun. I believe if you spent your money now, you will become a happy gamer in one or two years, when the game will be released."\n\n*END OF EDIT*\n\n\nI must say that I played more than 60 hours even before the steam version\n\nRight now I can't recommend this game.\nWHY??\nWell this game is in developed for more than two years, and only think that developers do, is adding a new features to the game.\nThey were unable to fix compatibility between versions of their own game (if you build huge city and they release next version of ALPHA you will not be able to load this city, you have to build new one)\nThey were unable to fix many bugs and when I am saing many, I don't mean small bugs and glitches. I mean really huge ones, when your city become unplayble and you have to build another.\nThey were unable to fix the problems with firts race and they already add another one\nThey were unable to do what the community wants.\nThey were unable to focus on the playability and they focuse only on visual side of the game\n\nAaaand we can continue\nI am not saying that this game will not be perfect (or at least good) but now it isn't\nGo play something else and when you see that this review changed to POSITIVE you know that it's time to buy this game.","December 1, 2015","true","27.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I saw the trailer and thought it looked amazing, so so I picked it up.  I'm glad I did.\n\nAs of now, Jan 21st 2016, Stonehearth is in an alpha state.  This means that features are not yet implemetned and the game is bare bones.  That said, it manages to have all the implemented features work well.  There is plenty of annoying things that happen, but the core gameplay is solid.  The bugs and glitches were relatively minor and did not destroy my experience.\n\nThe developers for this game seem amazing, and they have weekly blog posts detailing the new content they developed.  They are in touch with the community and support the game, as opposed to many early access developers.  This is a great thing.\n\nThe art style of the game is fantastic, and the music is delightful.  The theme that plays when you turn on the game is great.\n\nThis is the lightweight version of Dwarf Fortress that I have been waiting for.","January 21","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its unusually addicting. I try not to play it very often because i want to experience more of the game all at once. Remember it is still very heavily under construction, so buying the game means expect bugs and what not, and please add constructive feedback. This game is backed by an excelent group of Devs.\n\nGreat graphics for the style of game, music is addicting to say the least if not a bit repetitive right now. Gameplay although lacking many of the features they want to put in, even in its current state its amazingly fun.\nSimilar to Timber and Stone but a little less hardcore in the mechanics (another game i recomend you check out). Free build cities block by block. Assign jobs to your people (Carpenters, Stonemasons, Chefs, Soldiers, and many more). Keep them fed happy and protected from an assortment of baddies.\n\nThe only con i can see is the price. For the state of the game $25 is a little iffy. Certainly worth maybe $15 if you can catch a sale, and as long as the Devs stay on point it will be worth the $25 or even more.","January 22","true","22.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each hearthling will gain experiance in their given field, which unlocks skills or perks that improve their job performance, unlocking more recipes and such.\n\nThe dev's are very active, they stream 2-3 times a week and almost always post updates on their website each tuesday, and update their game on a regular basis.\n\nWhile it IS an alpha, there is already a lot of content, and more is always being added. Defs worth checking out the roadmap on their website, and talking to the community, which is super-friendly.\n\nMultiplayer is part of stonehearths future - I know many will be wondering this!

It had a bit of a rocky start, but as time went by we backers received a nice series of very interesting updates, fixing bugs and adding new features.\n\nRight now the game is still in Early Access, mind that. It still lacks many stuff and bugs are prone to lurk around. Having said that, this what you can play here is a beautiful experience with tons of potential. Think of it as a kind of Dwarf Fortress, but with nice (cute, even) Voxel graphics and a much, much, much kinder difficulty curve. You will begin each new game with a group of settlers, and from there on you must help them survive. Gather raw materials. Craft items. Grow plants. Build your town. Survive.\n\nOne VERY interesting feature of the game is the building system, which allows you to design your own buildings, letting your settlers do the whole construction stuff. Of course, be aware that larger building will take longer to build (as well as require more materials).\n\nPerhaps the current price is a bit steep, but if you like this kind of game (Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria) then StoneHearth might be just what you were looking for.","June 9, 2015","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It includes designing your own buildings, Promoting your hearthlings to more specialized jobs like Farmers,Blacksmiths, and Footmen. You'll of course have to harvest resources such as chopping down trees or mining for ore and stone and defend your town from would-be invaders. StoneHearth is in EA so the usual caveats are present but Radiant is diligent team and im confident they'll finish this.

You lay claim to some land and thriving place were your villagers can live without fear of the zombies, goblins and anyother terror that can come from the woods.\n\nI seriously think this is a huge step up from anyother type of AI run villager system too. Them seem to have been able to make it smooth and also the villager AI are very smart and intuitive. If they have some wood with them, and are trapped in a whole they will build a ladder to get out. Also when you ask a worker to make somethings, or a traders person to make a specific item, they actually do it and don't just eat all day like other AI villager systems I have been subjected to in other types of games like this.\n\nFor a Alpha this is a very good start even in somecases almost close to a beta when it comes to graphics and gameplay.\n\nIt does however need the rest of its trade's classes made in it and also some tweeks when it comes to eqiuping villagers with trait specific items that are already in the game. Example, better clothes to increase your worker speed. Can't and don't know or atleast haven't found a way to equip it. This holds for almost all items. The ones it doesn't are the items needed to change the job of your villager.\n\nAll in all this is a awesome alpha in my opinion but the price seems high for a alpha when the finished product isn't made yet and could possibly be a few months to a year away.","June 9, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is somewhere between Terraria, Minecraft, and Banished.  It has the Terraria feel of managing villagers.  Minecraft feel of Graphics and Blocky Texture.  A Banished feel because of the Mangement of the game keeping on top of you're Food supply.  Having mangement over you're Villagers'  jobs.\nThis game is one step up from Banished as you can determine your Villagers' house space and how the houses look, Windows, Doors, Wall Color, Heigth of the House  The Comination of buildings are endless.  But getting a handle on how to run a successful village is tough, it may take you a few tries but you'll get it soon enough.  But keep in mind this is still Early access so expect bugs.\nI love when a new villager comes to town... "Hi, my name is Smitty Werbanjiggermanjensen and I like to farm!"  Okay you're named Bob now and you can be a Blacksmith... Do It!\n\nI'd recommend getting this if you have alot of free time and nothing else to do.\n\n-Game Feature Ideas-\n~A Option to adjust the priority you're hearths complete Jobs.  Example, Hearths think Building is more important than Mining so they would Build instead of Mine.\n\n-Bugs-\nI sent my Hearthling Workers to start building a House, about half way through I was attacked so I went into Defensive Mode everybody went to the rally location then when the attack was over, they went on their merry way and never completed the house.   I started Building on the 4th day of Deepmun and it's currenty 24th of Deepmun.  And for some reason when I try to Save (Overwrite and/or New) there is a UI Error, I press F5.  Try to save again... UI Error, I press F5.  Try to save again...

It just needs to be regularly updated and developed further.  After all, it still is in the early access phase!","August 2, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then i when i figured out what to do i felt quite stupid (Personally).\nAt first i was just gathering resources but wasnt sure what to do, but then realised you have to set you people jobs, after that i started expanding, defend my self from goblins, then built a wall round my town and have just expanded on.\nAlthough it can be quite annoying to play due to the bugs and what have you it is only and Alpha so dont expect bug free.\n\nProblems\nNow yes it is only and alpha im not hating on it i understand but im only sharing a few bugs people should know about.\n\nBuildings with more than floor\nThis can be a pain as they will get stuck on the inside of the top floor if your not planning on using the second floor.\n\nUI\nIts written in C++ json files, similar to Minecraft. so yeah can expect the kind of bugs from it, if your changing a Person job and your looking at the list it can crash and stop you from setting Jobs, saving, crafting, and other things that require the UI to pop up a menu.\n(To fix this just press F5 to reset the UI)\n\nLag\nyou wont notice this till you have explored your area a bit and have at least 20 people in your town. When this happens prepare for all the Bugs. The UI system comepletely fails and stutters the game due to the all the for loops and the while scripts (Basically 24 FPS is coming your way).\n(I have found a way to sort of delay the lag, when its happens Reset the UI by Press F5. this resets all the Loop Scripts causeing it to refresh all the code thats waiting or looping in the game it wont cause any harm that i know i do it and i have no problems)\n\nConclusion\nYes there are problems but its an alpha and this game has insane potential im sticking around for the updates and playing it daily you ignore the bugs and just get on with it. i still recommened getting this game.","November 30, 2015","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is receiving updates every Thursday.  An update usually includes a new entity or two (some new content) and a lot of bug fixes.  While the pace seems a little slow, the updates are frequent and the two developers have a reputation of interacting with the community and effectively implenting feedback.\n\nThe developers are talented individuals with computer science degrees and related career experience.  Check out their website: http://www.radiant-entertainment.com/\n\nThey're not your average joe indie developers working out of their parents basement to make a quick buck.  These two are passionate individuals that want to create something truly enjoyable and worth playing.  That being said, Stonehearth still has many bugs and is definitely not as enjoyable now is it's destined to be.  And Stonehearth is destined to be the best Dwarf Fortress-like game of our age, that doesn't require a nerdy learning curve to actually enjoy.\n\nStonehearth is promised to be a depth-filled, fun adventure of building a village.  But unlike Banished or other village-builders, you will find yourself fabricating stories about your villagers as you explore, survive and build.  Just watch half the youtube Let's Plays if you don't believe me.  It's that imaginative element, that makes games like Stonehearth more than just another city-builder.  Stonehearth is not just another game, it's a journey into your own imagination as you build a village.  So, if the experience resonates with you, support this young and promising studio, as the developers craft a gem in the indie gaming world.  Personally, Stonehearth rubs off that feel-good aura, that this early access is an investment that's worth the risk!","August 16, 2015","true","26.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First, Ill start with the fact that the game is amazing. I realy like games where you build a city but in this game you have freedom to build the city as you like. Starting from editing the houses and buildings to naming each member of the city.\n\nNow, I think the game is a bit too buggy. For example, I ordered one of the crafters to craft 3 weapons, and he built only one and then he forgot his job and just wasted my time.\n\nI realy recommend this game for anyone who like games like SimCity, Banished, ZooTycoon, or Dwarfs.

They estimated the game would be out of early access within 8-12 months after launching in June 2015, so it is shaping up they will overshoot that target by quite a bit, but that's all pretty normal for game development.\n\nIt's already very playable and the development team are clearly talented coders, but I recommend waiting until the release as that will offer the best experience, plus they will have multiplayer then (hopefully).","November 4, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is quite, quite enjoyable, if you're a fan of city-builder/resource gathering games, if not, you might not want to buy it. At full price, it might seem like a bit of a trap for the less wary, but, if you want to support the developers(and have a few extra dollars laying around.), it isn't that big of a problem.

Then i when i figured out what to do i felt quite stupid (Personally).\nAt first i was just gathering resources but wasnt sure what to do, but then realised you have to set you people jobs, after that i started expanding, defend my self from goblins, then built a wall round my town and have just expanded on.\nAlthough it can be quite annoying to play due to the bugs and what have you it is only and Alpha so dont expect bug free.\n\nProblems\nNow yes it is only and alpha im not hating on it i understand but im only sharing a few bugs people should know about.\n\nBuildings with more than floor\nThis can be a pain as they will get stuck on the inside of the top floor if your not planning on using the second floor.\n\nUI\nIts written in C++ json files, similar to Minecraft. so yeah can expect the kind of bugs from it, if your changing a Person job and your looking at the list it can crash and stop you from setting Jobs, saving, crafting, and other things that require the UI to pop up a menu.\n(To fix this just press F5 to reset the UI)\n\nLag\nyou wont notice this till you have explored your area a bit and have at least 20 people in your town. When this happens prepare for all the Bugs. The UI system comepletely fails and stutters the game due to the all the for loops and the while scripts (Basically 24 FPS is coming your way).\n(I have found a way to sort of delay the lag, when its happens Reset the UI by Press F5. this resets all the Loop Scripts causeing it to refresh all the code thats waiting or looping in the game it wont cause any harm that i know i do it and i have no problems)\n\nConclusion\nYes there are problems but its an alpha and this game has insane potential im sticking around for the updates and playing it daily you ignore the bugs and just get on with it. i still recommened getting this game.","November 30, 2015","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have done a great job devs!!\n\nBut as always there are things which isn't so great:\n- Should probably be a little bit more difficult to defeat the one man/wolf "army" attacking you. I know there have been one instance where there were 3 i think.\n\n- Building!! Building should feature walls inside, but I think you are already working on that.\n\n- You can't destroy building after you have startet building them. This is why i restart so often because something didn't turn up the way it should and then the butiful world destroyed.\n\n- The looting of goblin camps after you have killed the enemy dosen't work the way you expect. I want the loot, but don't get it maybe because it is too far away from the settlement?\n\nThese missing things are not all, but are of big effect on the experience\n\n\nBut all in all I am actually pleased with this game!! And YES, I do recommend this game to all you gamers out there, but be advised: this is a early access game which means there will be bugs and missing features.","December 22, 2015","true","64.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However the large amount of bugs I keep coming across prevent some simple tasks.\n\nIt'd be nice if when you start tunneling down that the villagers could at least know they need ladders to get out.\n\nI will also point out how the interface is very simple to get the hang of.  For those who have played the game Gnomoria, the stockpile system is very similar and won't be hard to get used to.\n\nAll in all, this game has a ton of potential as a sandbox village creating game.

I will say the game is not all perfect it has a few bugs that i hope will be fixed, but we must remember it is only in Alpha. On the other hand i have put lots of time and effort into my town to strive and survive from gobblin raids, zombies, skeletons, and wolfs. The best thing about this game is that once you find your town grows, you become a target! I would give this game a 8 out of 10. 8 only because i got my town to be so big and i loved it so much, but every time i play that save i get server crashes that wont allow me to move on, which sucks.
