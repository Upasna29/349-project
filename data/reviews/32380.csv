And the version there is vastly superior to the Steam release. The background music works and it finally lets you run the game properly. I HIGHLY suggest you get it there.\n\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_jedi_knight_dark_forces_ii\n\nOriginal review:\n\nDark Forces 2 is a game I grew up with. It's an amazing game that I think has aged extremely well and is as enjoyable today as it was back in the 90's.\n\nHowever as good as Dark Forces 2 is. It is completely ruined by how shoddily the game runs on modern operating systems. It's to the point where if you try and run it in a 64 bit OS you have to trade between getting the game to render with proper colors vs a playable framerate.\n\nThis is a major case of buyer beware. It's near impossible to run on Windows 7 and 8 64bit properly, and the only way I got this game to work was by installing a Virtual Machine. Only purchase if you're willing to put up with how badly this game runs.","September 16, 2014","false","11.7"," 105 of 128 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","105","128","2","25"

Partly due to nostalgia for a game that I grew up with, but despite somewhat out-dated graphics there is still great gameplay. The levels aren't all boring straightforward run and shoot, and it still contains the best lightsabre use of any starwars game I've played to date.\n\nHowever. This version of the game takes so much work to actually run that i'm amazed that steam has released it as is (and have not even attempted to fix). I needed to install old graphics drivers, run in compatibility mode, download the music separately (outside of steam) and insert into the files manually. Thankfully the steam community has a couple of walkthroughs on how to get the game to run. But - desptie this it will still regularly crash when exiting a menu, or after saving the game.\n\nI would not reccommend you buy the steam version of it only due to these horrible compatibility problems (apparently the GOG version works much better).","May 3","false","10.7"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","29","34","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KungFooZombie/recommended/32380/","KungFooZombie","KungFooZombie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KungFooZombie/","203 products in account","Final edit: I have played through both Jedi Knight and Mysteries of the Sith (the expansion). To do so I followed Steam user -FwG- ^ Bucky's instructions (thanks, man!). I had to roll back my AMD videocard drivers. This means I had to remove all current videocard drivers and install this, older, videocard driver: 13.1 WHQL, which can be found here: http://www.mediafire.com/download/s5tl45g6sce5wp7/AMD_Catalyst_13.1_Non-Legacy.zip\n\nAlso, I had to download a DLL file from the JKHub website, which can be found here: http://www.jkhub.net/project/get.php?id=1804. Put the file in the same folder where you JK.exe or Mots.exe is.\nDon't forget to turn on hardware acceleration in the setup menu in-game.\n\nSo, does all of this change my opinion? Well, no. Jedi Knight and its expansion are awesome games, but the way Steam provides them to us is unacceptable. The amount of tweaking that has to be done, is quite severe. If you're not very technical or aren't allowed to change videocard drivers the game is unplayable on PC's with AMD cards.\n\nBesides the tweaking, several issues remain. The cutscenes in Jedi Knight and Mysteries play in a minimized sceen in the top left corner of your screen and the soundtrack doesn't loop, leaving out music for an incredible large part of the game (a Star Wars game without the epic music?!).\n\nIf the game was playable as it was intended I would give it ten thumbs up, if I could. But in its current state on Steam, I cannot recommend it. The way Steam throws a broken version of a beautiful game online to be sold, without any heart for how much this game means to people, is unacceptable.\n\n\n\nEDIT: After toying with videocard settings and in-game resolutions, I was able to get some gameplay out of it. Still, there are the crashes (when going to the menu screen and back), the small windows in which the menus and videos are shown, the ingame music that doesn't loop (tracks stop after one play-through, so the rest of the level is without music) and the lack of 3D accelaration.\n\nSo, contrary to what I stated in my review below, the game can be played, but not stable and with a poor audio and video presentation.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn short: are you running Windows 7, 64Bit with an AMD video card? Then the game will not run.\n\nI'm really wondering if the positive reviews on this game's store page are by people that bought the game on Steam and are playing that or are they by people that remember the game from way back? I would think the latter. If I would have to grade it by how I remember it, it would have ten thumbs up. But now, through Steam not so much.\n\nIf you're using Windows 7, do not expect to install and play. It requires a lot of tweaking, downloading unofficial patches and files to get it running. At this time it is not possible to get it running like in the old days. The videos, for example, will only run in a small window in the upper left corner of your screen.\n\nThe thumbs down is more for Steam than for the game itself. I love the Kyle Katarn saga and this game was one of the finest in the series. But I feel cheated for buying this and I was so looking forward to this after finishing the first Dark Forces game.\n\nI expect to buy something that works. I have very limited technical computer skills, so trying to make sense of how to get this game to work, is ruining my experience.\nI'm now browsing through forums, downloading god knows what kind of files and trying anything to be able to play this game.

You get full motion cutscenes, which contribute a true Star Wars feeling, and the giant levels are designed really well and are never TOO challenging yet rarely easy. Even before you get the lighsaber you become addicted because you are looking for secret areas and taking out jerks with guns like a badass! The graphics don't hold up quite as well as the latter entries in the series, but they are still good enough to keep you interested; which is something I cannot say of the Dark Forces. The final thing that makes this game great is the story; you can choose the light side or dark side and both stories are pretty awesome. Your actions can change the story and the 7 Dark Jedi you have to fight don't take it easy on you! Out of the countless Star Wars games I have played over the years, I think this one is the most fun. (The Super Star Wars series, Battlefront games, and KOTOR are very close) But seriously, any Star Wars fan needs to get this game!!","September 30, 2014","true","19.7"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

Note that I'm not judging the gameplay itself-- I haven't gotten to experience that, thanks to how they put no effort into making sure it was compatible before putting both games up for $11 total.\n\nYup, it's pretty well-known at this point that the Steam edition of both DFII and MotS are broken.  I mean, I've fixed a lot of games myself for Windows 7.  Guess what?  I actually CAN'T!  Even if I got past the framerate issues and color problems (which I was, by literally shutting down explorer.exe along with doing all this other ♥♥♥♥ just for a 90's Star Wars game), the soundtrack's gone.  It was on the disc directly read, and the lazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who ported this to Steam didn't think it was necessary to bring over the soundtrack that makes a Star Wars game a freakin' Star Wars game.\n\nOverall, 1/10.  Broken PoS.  Note that this is a score for the re-release.  I was excited to play it, as it's supposedly the best Star Wars game ever made (arguably, of course there are some people who prefer Battlefront, KotOR, etc).  However, I didn't get to play the game they were charging for because what's more of a joke than this game's compatibility is how much of an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Lucas happens to be.\n--\nBut don't worry, there IS a solution!  Star Wars week(s) on GOG, came as a surprise and the games it brought was even more surprising, stuff we never thought we'd see again.  If you aren't aware of what GOG is, sit down and I'll tell you what's up.  Perhaps you've heard of The Witcher franchise... maybe?  Okay, whatever.  Well, they're a team based in Poland that also happens to have a site called GOG, where they legally sell games DRM-free and have excellent support teams for issues that come up.  Perhaps what I like the most about the site, though, is how they do everything they can to FIX the game for modern platforms.  This game works in widescreen 1080p without any of the bugs (it even has the soundtrack working properly, and the "No CD" error is gone) if you get the GOG Edition.  Get it there, and thanks to GOG for saving yet another classic.  $6 for not just a fully Windows 7/8-ified Dark Forces 2, but a similarly fixed Mysteries of the Sith comes with it at no extra cost.  GOG is officially better than Steam when it comes to old games.\n\nWant to play this game the way it was meant to be played?

It caught my attention a couple of nights ago, sitting there in my Steam "pile of shame" and all - and well, what can I say, didn't have this much fun with a shooter in a LONG time.\n\nNot exaggerating, I am pretty much impressed by the quality this game still offers. Sure, it doesn't look too hot and the Steam release is kinda busted  with no ingame music (which would be kind of a dealbreaker (as the audio is AMAZING), if I hadn't played the original back then without CD Audio too - because you had to add some extra cable between your CD drive and your soundcard for CD Audio and the family computer at home didn't have that) and menus as well as cutscenes displaying in a window with SVGA resolution (which is less than 15% of my current screen setup).\n\nBut even with these flaws, the game itself felt quite refreshing compared to more recent shooters I have played. One part is of course the license attached, you cannot beat classic Star Wars. This is before the Prequel-Trilogy turned everything to ♥♥♥♥ and Star Wars was awesome without a doubt. Luckily, the cutscenes are done with real actors and as such aren't nearly half as bad as old ♥♥♥ CGI stuff usually is - this was actually pretty well done and the story quite entertaining / engaging even though it's certainly neither original nor clever.\n\nThe main reason this game is blast is certainly the level design, you can easily tell that a bit of that old John Romero-magic has inspired the people behind Jedi Knight. The levels are both maze-like and complex but have a lot of landmarks and offer a certain flow once you get into the groove. I remember being completely lost back in the day, but this time around all these areas just clicked with me and I made a lot of progress and even enjoyed checking out a few odd ends uncovering secret areas. Due to technical limitations, it's still kinda abstract - but in that Doom Episode 1-kinda way were everything feels like it kind of makes sense though your imagination fills in a few of the blanks that the technology just couldn't handle in '97. And there is a LOT of memorable situations crammed into these levels - dramatic battles hundreds of meters above the ground on various platforms hovering in mid air, crawling over fuel pipes between space crafts and space ports, venturing deep into the bowels of imperial battlestations by way of ventilation systems and tunnels. Some maps are also impressively expansive, without chopping the areas up into several smaller maps like certain other "classics" (*cough* Half-Life *cough*).\n\nThis enjoyment of exploring these levels gets amplified when the force powers are introduced - force jump and force speed open up a lot of possibilities to reach places that you couldn't reach otherwise - also allowing to shortcut here and there and of course uncover many of the hidden secrets (which actually serve a purpose and allow you to get more force stars to spend on various abilities) - it is a kind of liberating freedom and more often than not you get rewarded for checking out that weird ledge that seems kinda out of place but reachable or the suspicious platform that just might be the right way to go.\n\nAs I said, the maps really impressed me and certainly have that classic style to them that got lost over time, just to be replaced by the boring and straightforward map designs of today - pretty much my number one reason to check Jedi Knight out. The rest of the game is sort of outdated and/or requires you to adjust to it's quirks like the somewhat floaty movement or the less than optimal lightsaber action. It is still playable and all (and I certainly enjoyed the rather simplistic shooting (not hitzones as far as I can tell) with barely any enemy taking more than 2 or 3 hits and most of them being struck down easily with a single lightsaber attack) but it doesn't control as amazing/precisely as Quake 3 or Unreal Tournament. And I can't quite say anything good about the lightsaber duels, those can be a right pain - I like that they are in the game and they certainly add to the uniqueness of Jedi Knight but they are frankly put not the strongest point of it (to be fair though, even in 2015 nobody got first person melee right in my opinion).\n\nAll in all, I think Jedi Knight is an incredible game (considering it's age) - in my book it is the far better alternative to Half-Life, which was released just a year later - funny how it took me almost 20 years to figure that out. Highly recommended to check this one out the next time it's in a sale or something, if you can stomach it's visuals and the somewhat poor performance of the Steam release that is. Impressive piece of code.","November 11, 2015","true","7.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","2"

Playing this game in the year 2014 gave me more respect for this title than disgust. Besides what most would call outdated graphics, I found Dark Forces 2 to still look beautiful with very well done levels that you could see the people who made them were passionate about what they were creating. This is reinforced by the live action cutscenes, which at first you think would look quite weird. But they look perfectly, which helps you get immersed into the story. I think live action cutscenes are also great cause you can see their passion for the game as it takes more reasources to make movie like scenes for a game. Anyway, the game is enjoyable, features a great story, and still has great gameplay. Each enemy type feels unique and presents their own challenge, each boss fight feels rewarding and different. The story is flawless and is a great introduction to the Expanded Universe of Star Wars for hardcore fans to fans of the movies. I strongly recommend this title as I could see no faults with this game. It's sad to see most people I see own this game and never play it. I also strongly recommend those people to give it a try.\n\nIf anyone has any other questions or concerns don't hesistate to add me i'll be happy to answer them!","May 13, 2014","true","10.7"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","3"

Kyle will start as in Dark Forces with his blaster, making his way with laser shots, but the moment he finds the lightsaber the game will suggest you a third person view (you can use a first person camera if you prefer, but I never did). This will be useful to better control Kyle during lightsaber fights, use of force powers and jumps... Long and very high jumps. This game was a great innovation for its time as it's the first successful attempt to give the player the control of a jedi knight in action (and no, fight tournaments doesn't count at all...), with force powers and all. Of course, it's very crude and unripe, animations are really simple (not to mention the coarse secondary lightsaber attack), force powers are a little cluncky to control at first, but everything comes more handy with time. Another very important part of this game is the double ending. Kyle can end being a Jedi (Canonic ending) or fall to the dark side, and everything according to your behaviour ingame, for example with civilians, or when you choose which force power to improve (you can choose between, neutral, light and dark powers).\nOf Course it can't be a Star Wars game without the original amazing soundtrack from John Williams. Unfortunately they're no longer dynamic tracks as in Dark Forces and the music doesn't loop immediately so there wil be moments of silence which kind of ruin the atmosphere.\nLevels are pretty big, and with some little puzzles involving switches and timings, but the most particular side inherited by Dark Forces is the maze-like structure sided with hidden passages. To go ahead you have to find THAT hidden passage and this leads to the next place, and this can be sometimes very frustrating, especially in the falling ship level, for example. But that's an example of a good thing as well, as there are levels and situations designed with creativity, with the falling ship being the best example of this.\nUnfortunately the game shows its age really bad. Very low polys for models and levels, low resolution textures, the lightsaber looks made of plastic not to mention the very LOW compatibility on modern systems. I had to apply patches and look for more alternatives to get past glitches and very bad issues, but at last I've successfully made it playable. There are also patches that improve a little some textures and the lightsaber effect. At least it compensate with something quite rare: cutscenes with real actors! I wouldn't give any of the actors, nor the FX crew an oscar but I just love them and they did a good job especially if you consider when this was done.\n\n+++PROs+++ STORY. Definitely a very good story with everything, Kyle, Jan Ors, the Foe Jerec, his disciples, all with different motivations and nature, great situations and surprises. Everything told ingame or with Live-Action cutscenes!\nJEDI! For the first time we get to move and control a Jedi, with a lightsaber and force powers.\n...OR SITH? It's not supposed to be a canon part of the story but your behaviour is monitored and your choices and actions will tip the balance towards the light or dark side giving different endings.\nSOUNDTRACK. Of course there's always the amazing music from the Original Star Wars soundtrack.---CONs--- SOUNDTRACK. ...But unlike its predecessor and successor it isn't a dynamic soundtrack that alternates calm tracks in exploring situations and more active music during fights. Besides the music won't loop immediately leaving moments of silence.\nSTORY. "Grab a lightsaber -> become a Jedi" is a very wrong axiom, but I'm too kind and I forgive them for this simplification.\nLOW-COMPATIBILITY ISSUES. This game is very old and of course issues and glitch were expected. My first attempt resulted in a black screen ingame with all sounds and events running, or completely inverted/pixel-blasted textures. Luckily, after GTA IV I've gained enough patience to read deeply the Steam Community to find different solutions and patches, and I've made it work eventually... Too bad that seems like the GOG release is already patched and fully working... -.-\nLEVELS STRUCTURE. Especially in the last sections they're really tough, with some particular puzzles or a mandatory too well hidden passage for the next place. It requires very good observation and attention to details.","May 27","true","7.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/recommended/32380/","Drakevarg","Drakevarg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/","94 products in account","What is it with Nar Shadda? The place has featured at least three times over the course of the Dark Forces Saga and once in KOTOR II, and it was the weakest part of the game every time. There's just something about the Smuggler's Moon that lends itself to rubbish level design.\n\nAnyway, after checking a few guides on getting the damn thing to run, I finally got Dark Forces II to play. The game starts out a bit rocky, as most of your ammunition is scavanaged off of your fallen enemies, an ineffective strategy when about half of your enemies come at you with good old fisticuffs. This led to a few occasions when I had to take out a dozen enemies with six blaster shots and my own punches, and sadly it seems Kyle hasn't been working out quite like he used to as the fists that could once drop a Kell Dragon are barely enough to put down passing thugs.\n\nFortunately once you get off Nar Shadda, enemies are universally packing heat, and the game starts to come to life. Ugly, early full-3D life, but life nonetheless. The level design is somewhere between the original Dark Force's nonlinear approach and Jedi Outcast's straight shot from start to finish, and manages to have the strengths and weaknesses of both. The levels are truly impressive in size, and lead to some memorable setpieces (most dramatic, if relatively brief, of which is a scene when you're left trying to sprint for the hangar bay of a ship in freefall), but they also follow a highly specific thread of advancement that, while not so bad as Dark Force's tendancy to block off progression to people who can't use sideways moon logic, still can leave you poking around a level for half an hour looking for the solitary path forward. Perhaps they felt the necessity due to the actual presence of maps in the game, but the locations beat out Jedi Outcasts in that their layout actually seems to have something to do with the location you're alledgedly visiting (for example, a starship whose rooms are actually laid out in the shape of a starship).\n\nHowever, despite the strengths I mention, I ultimately can't recommend the game because its sprawling design isn't quite as good as Dark Forces, and its storyline isn't as good as Jedi Outcast's, lacking relatable characters and quite often much of a plot at all. For example, once you aquire a lightsaber from your father's droid, you start using Force powers without training, or indeed any exposition that you had any Force potential at all (the lightsaber isn't even your father's, so a hereditary connection isn't implied either). Just "here's a lightsaber, start using superpowers." Not to mention the lightsaber is basically useless in this game. Sure it can deflect blaster shots if you're facing in the right direction, but I ultimatley wound up using my normal weapons for 99% of the game, only pulling out my lightsaber to cut open grates and fight the bosses.\n\nSpeaking of which, apart from the game's tendancy to dump you somewhere with not much more than a cursory mention of why you were there (such as letting me run around in a fuel depot for an hour before I actually realize that I'm trying to use it to sneak onto a ship through the fuel lines), the bosses are also generally pretty weak. Unlike the first enemy you make in the game, the sleazy protocol droid 8t88, who obviously can't put up anything resembling a fight, all of the bosses are the main villain Jerec's Dark Jedi cronies, who mostly just stand around in the background of expository cutscenes until they randomly turn up at the end of certain levels for a boss fight apiece. Who are they? Dunno. A smug twit, a domanatrix, a big-guy-little-guy alien duo, and a giggling Twi'lek who I'm reasonably certain was brain damaged. That's about the extent of characterization you get. As for the fight themselves, they weren't as luck-based as Jedi Outcast and Academy's Dark Jedi fights, but they gave very little indication of how well you were doing so I usually just jumped around clicking my very slow attack button until the bad guy fell down.\n\nUltimately, between the compatibility issues with modern machines, the weak plot, and the occasionally frustrating gameplay (looking at you, rocket Stormtroopers), I can't really recommend bothering with this entry just to enjoy its middling-quality level design.\n\n-----\n\nI recently went back to play this one, and at first I thought it might be a similar case to Jedi Outcast, where a second playthrough was giving me a better outlook on the game. This, however, turned out not to be the case. Nar Shadda was a pain as before, for the same reason of simply not having enough gun-toting enemies to supply your ammunition needs. However, things picked up again afterwards, roughly up to the point where you reach the planet where the Valley of the Jedi is located, maybe halfway through the game.\n\nI should clarify my old remark on the game's "middling-quality" level design. It's not middling-quality. In fact it's remarkably good, giving you a firm sense of scale, location, and continuity. I'm legitimatly impressed that they managed to stretch a single starship across two or three levels without ever giving you the impression that you've visited the bulk of it. Sure it's very game-y in the sense that navigating them is far more complicated than one could reasonably expect the people who actually belond there to put up with, but compared to the cramped squiggly hallways and bottomless pit abuse of later entries it does its job very well.\n\nHowever, this falls apart around the halfway point of the game. Once you reach the Valley of the Jedi, the entire rest of the game is spent on that planet, and consists entirely of navigating narrow cliffs and Imperial outposts whose existence is never explained, given that the vilains would never have had a chance to set up this elaborate series of bunkers, ventilation shafts, cardo areas,and drills before you got there, seeing as how they explicitly reached the planet at the same time you did.\n\nBut more importantly than that mild bit of fridge logic, the real failure of the latter half of the game is that it's just bland. The sets are just as big and interconnected as before, but they now lack context, being little more than a meandering series of setpieces with no obvious purpose, simply stalling time between you and your actual destination. The temple itself, which you spend the entire time trying to reach, is also pretty small by the game's standards, basically just three or four floors of tight corridors until you reach the end and get 'rewarded' with two boss fights in a row and the game ends.\n\nSo in conclusion while a second playthrough gave me a renewed appreciation for the level design, the latter half is dull enough that I still can't recommend it, especially given how crash-prone the game is.","February 12, 2015","false","21.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The only thing that didn't age well in this game is the graphics.  The models can look horrible at times, but overall the immense levels create a sense of immersion rarely seen in games these days.  The level design is top notch, the length of each level is very long, and the variety of weapons is perfect.  This is a Star Wars game at its best.  The storyline is well done too, though the video produced cutscenes are cheesy at best, but at least they keep the story going, and the story gives you reason and meaning to why you are fighting.  I did have some issues with the game.  The amount of times that I died and had to restart from a save from a long time ago was very frustrating.  I wish this game had auto save, which would have been perfect when specific goals on your objectives were completed.  Also, the lack of the audio music from Star Wars (which was played from the CD in the original format) is absent in this Steam version.

I don't recommend it for WIndows 8/10 PCs as it usually runs pretty badly. My WIndows 7 rig ran it without a lot of issues.\n\nIt's a pity, because the game is just absolutely fantastic. Levels are huge, but not empty, and make great use of verticality. The automap is great at showing you where you're supposed to go, and really gives you a much better idea of how big levels are.) There are a lot of nooks and crannies to explore throughout. The guns are satisfying, not great (Dark Forces I had better looking and feeling weapons IMO) , and the movement is really great, kinda like Quake's movement but with less momentum, handy, as JK tends to have more platforming and tight passages of which you don't want to fall out of. Force Powers are nothing special (This was before the prequel Trilogy, though), but some of them are well used in levels (especially Force Jump, but also Speed.) There are Dark Side (mostly damage-dealing) and Light Side (buffs/healing) It also has a lot of battles with Dark Jedi, but they're quite lackluster, since the lightsaber combat is pretty clunky.\n\nThe story consists mostly of live action cutscenes with some pretty cheesy acting, but pretty good overall (sadly, they run on what seems to be a 640x480 window on my PC, same as the menus.) The cool thing is that on about the last third of the game, you get locked into either Dark Side or Light Side. This will depend on how many innocents you've killed, and whether you invested in dark or light side force powers. Keeping mostly loyal to a side gives you a special force power (Protection/Deadly Sight.) I should probably play the game again to Force Lightning the hell of out everyone :)\n\nIf you run on Windows 7 or older you might be fine. 8 or 10, give it a try!

Requires a bit of homework to get running on modern systems but is worth the effort. Feels a bit clunky at times but you get used to it. Weapon choices are cool but many go unused. Lightsabre fighting seemed novel, though duels, while interestingly breaking up gameplay, felt a bit slapdash. Force powers were similarly cool, sometimes clunky. The FMV cinematics between every level were a combination of awesome and cheesy, much like the story itself. Sadly the music seems to have been gutted from this version, and little bits of lore are lost on the loading screens because the game loads so fast.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/contaan/recommended/32380/","contaan","Booty Bamboozler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/contaan/","93 products in account","The sequel to Star Wars: Dark Forces, now with live action cutscenes, lightsabers, Force Powers and Jedi! This game is another nostalgic piece to my 90’s gaming history and once again, another classic in the Star Wars gaming lineup. Once again, it features Kyle Katarn and his journey to becoming a Jedi and stopping Jerec, the main antagonist from becoming all-powerful. The game also does what its predecessor did not do: gives you some moral choices which affect the ending. The cutscenes are fairly comical (especially Jerec), even though the story is once again, in my opinion, fairly dark. Another outstanding game in an outstanding series of games from LucasArts so I recommend you just buy the entire Jedi Knight series.\n\n\n*The game requires DosBox however, with the Steam download, everything will be set up for you to enjoy as soon as the game is downloaded.\n\nStory/Characters:\nYou continue to follow Kyle Katarn in his quest for continuing to kick ♥♥♥ and saving the galaxy. Characters are given live actors which is either good or bad as your mileage may vary. Looking back at the cutscenes, I find them enjoyable.\n\nGameplay:\nFor the first several levels, you will be doing the old shooting and scooting until you get your lightsaber. From there, its hacking and slashing to victory with Force powers mixed in. The actions you do in-game will affect the “path” you will go down, either with the Light or Dark Side. This includes saving civilians and making choices in the main storyline. As with the last game, you will be fighting mini bosses in the form of Jerec’s Sith cronies. The lightsaber fights are awkward in my experience, as the hit detection seems to be off so you will end up just flailing your weapon around like a madman hoping to get a hit. There are some cool Force powers available however, ones that were not seen in the movies which is a bonus!\n\nGraphics:\nOnce again, your mileage will vary. Either you like the 2D pixels of Dark Forces, or the angular and stiff 3D appearance of Dark Forces 2… pick your poison. Regardless, it gets the job done as it is oddly satisfying to see sparks fly when you hit the walls with your lightsaber. I did get this extremely annoying color glitch and it seems many old games have this issue (Starcraft), where the colors all turn into a headache inducing, blinding neon such as bright teal and pink. I had to mess with the graphical options in-game which I believe was 3D acceleration and make sure the game ran with Admin powers with the compatibility options enabled.\n\nSound/Music:\nEnemies make the appropriate noises as they are dismembered by Kyle’s lightsaber of justice or riddled with bolts from the Repeater Rifle. Guns and the lightsaber make their iconic sounds. Lightsabers make their crackling noises as they strike each other in the boss duels, or thermal detonators going off in that Rodian’s face. The music is excellent as it usually is in Star Wars games… the Imperial March is as good as it was in the 90’s, as it is now.\n\nControls:\nThe game allows you to use a joystick or the standard keyboard and mouse. I prefer the latter but I do believe I remember playing it with the joystick when I was a kid. (Note: I did not get very far.) You may also customize hotkeys from everything from moving to weapons to force powers.\n\nReplay value:\nYou may play through the Dark and Light side paths and try out all the Force powers but there are no achievements or any real incentives to play over and over.\n\nOnline:\nThe ancestor to Jedi Knight Jedi Outcast’s multiplayer. Nowadays, there may be some group somewhere in a galaxy far, far away playing this multiplayer if you look hard enough but I have never played it.\n\n---\n\n***If there are any mistakes to the facts pertaining to the game, please let me know. Also, if you have further questions not covered by the review, or if something were unclear, I will try to clarify as best as possible. Thanks!\n","November 24, 2012","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/recommended/32380/","korerat","KoreRat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/","636 products in account","Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II is the second game in the Jedi Knight Series.  With some new tech in the engine, actually its a whole new engine.  Some keen ideas in the story, and a few role-playing game elements mixed in.  Jedi Knight is a visible step up from the path that Dark Forces paved.  But just how much of a step is it, and will it surpass its predecessors Breakdown?\n\nJedi Knight, in my opinion, has some of the best story telling I’ve seen in games of its era.  It uses what has almost become a lost art, full motion video.  So many games today are switching over to scripted sequences that are rendered right in the game with the engine carrying the load.  While this can be a great tool for the story telling, at times the better tool is a FMV sequence.  The other great thing about Jedi Knight’s FMV’s are that they use live actors.  Actual people interacting with the CGI characters at the CGI locations.  That does a great job of putting you in the world with a small graphic budget.\n\nJedi Knight had very little compatibility issues, I simply installed it within Steam and in minutes was playing.  At first I had some interesting graphical problems, but with a little help from the Steam Community I got things working in fine order.  The resolution is changeable, but 1280 x 1024 is the highest it goes.  Which was not issues for me, since that’s what I operate with these days.\n\nThe game does play full screen, but it goes windowed in between levels and to show the FMV’s.  This sometimes caused issues where the full screen shows a blinking or faded border.  Not a game breaker, but was just an eye-sore.\n\nControls were a bit clunky, especially the lightsaber combat.  Fighting Storm Troopers was easy enough, but once you had to fight another Jedi it became a real conflict.  There was a definite delay from mouse-click to saber-swing, which made fighting the more challenging foes that much more challenging.  Also Jedi Knight has a auto-aim feature, something akin to the games predecessors, like Doom and Quake.  You only need aim in the general direction and the game will make sure the target is hit.  There are times where this is great and brings the skill level of the game down a notch or two, and a couple points where its an annoyance.\n\nThe grenades, or Thermal Detonators as the game would call them, even though actual Thermal Detonators would be far more powerful than what appears in the game.  Either way, they are virtually useless.  A simple click while holding one will practically drop it at your feet.  You throw them at an odd arc that I was unable to get the hang of during my play.  By holding down the fire button you can throw the Det further, but the angles were too hard for me to master and I typically just threw it into the wall or ceiling.\n\nJedi Knight has a Light/Dark pseudo system.  There is a point in the story where you make the choice of Light or Dark.  This choice is made for you, based on your actions up to that point.  If you were bad and killed too many non-hostile NPC’s then you’ll go the dark route.  I was actually bummed when I got the dark route.  I’d known I had killed a few non-hostiles, but had hoped it wasn’t too many.  And unfortunately I had learned about the prospect of different endings too late into the game, and didn’t want to start it all over again.  So I had just been hoping for the best.\n\nThe levels are fairly par for the time.  Mostly inside buildings, with doors, switches, and decent lighting.   Most of the maps have you searching for a key or switch to unlock the other side of the map.  Often this is easy enough, however there were a couple times where the door or switch was annoyingly hard to locate.  In many cases doors are simply a different sheet metal looking texture, and have no marking to show its a door.  And switches can be found in some very strange places.  There was many a time where I strafed walk along a wall rapidly tapping the ‘Use’ key.  Jedi Knight also makes sure to fill the Star Wars cliche of massive bottomless chasms to fall into.\n\nThe maps are typicality very large, you can tell the developers were going for that classic Star Wars feel of large spaces.  Many times you can see out windows or over ledges to these vast expanses.   These must have looked nicer years ago.  Because now I feel a lot of the effect is lost in the lower end graphics.  You can clearly see the repeating textures and where the map surface ends and the skybox begins.  Sometimes this is hidden fairly well with fading, as a way to try and preserve the feel of distance.\n\nOverall the game is pretty solid.  It has parts that have short comings, but they all fit together nicely.  Showing just how solid of a game it was back in its day.  It shows a good level of improvement from its predecessor, which raises hopes of a continues level of improvement into the rest of the series.  There are far worst games from the late nineties that you could play.\n\nWith a few exceptions, one of the biggest being the headaches some of these older games cause, I did enjoy my time with Jedi Knight.  It was nice to venture back in time with Kyle Katarn.  I know him well in many Star Wars novels, but finally get to take the time to really learn his backstory.","May 16, 2013","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So, does it work? The answer is no, probably not. If your hardware supports DirectX 9.0 or above, Dark Forces II will experience numerous graphical errors. However, there is a user-made patch that forwards broken functions to working DX7 functions, solving any graphical errors. This patch should have been packaged with the steam version, considering most people who use steam probably have a graphics card that is less than seven-ish years old.\n\nReview:\nIn Dark Forces II, you step into the shoes of Kyle Katarn as he tracks down his father's murderers. He quickly discovers that Jeric, a Dark Jedi responsible for his father's death, has embarked upon a journey to find the "Valley of the Jedi", a source of power that would make him virtually invincible. Kyle travels home and is granted a lighsaber, and is then able to unlock and evolve his force powers as he confronts Jeric and other Dark Jedi. Your available powers and the game's story adapt to your choices. These choices will eventually lead you down the path to the dark or light side of the force.\n\nThe multiple endings are unparalleled even by more modern games, and this introduces a fantastic level of replayability. The replay factor is further increased by an array of secrets hidden in each of the levels that are quite fun to hunt down. You can use powers like speed and jump to reach previously unreachable areas, so upgrading your powers in different areas will yield different secrets, and a different overall gameplay experience.\n\nThe gameplay itself is very fun. Dark Forces gave people lightsaber control for the first time, and the level of immersion that it achieves ranks much higher than more modern Star Wars games, such as The Force Unleashed. You are also granted an arsenal of guns, crossbows, rockets, and grenades (along with special attacks on a few of them) to wipe out entire fortresses of enemies. The introduction of 3D graphics also allow you to move into third-person mode, which is a preferable viewpoint for control of your lightsaber. Later in the game, you can unlock powers such as force lightning, grip, throw, and more. The introduction of new elements through the entire game keeps combat exciting and non-repetitive.\n\nThere are cutscenes after most levels that feature live actors on pre-rendered backgrounds. Although the rendering was very good, some of the acting was pretty bad in my opinion. However, the actor playing Kyle, the protagonist, is fairly good, and I still looked forward to the cutscenes.\n\nIn terms of graphics and design, all of the levels are completely unique. I've played a few games from this same era, and a lot of them are quite brown and lifeless. The game designers did a very good job of incorporating different colors and worlds into the game, giving you an excellent sense of where you were. One level even takes place on a stinking ship, distorting gravity and allowing you to run up walls and elevator shafts (something that you probably saw in Episode III, however this was done many years before).\n\nThere was also 3D sound incorporated that game developers reportedly "tweaked extensively" to give whole new level to the immersion already present. This is something that a lot of gamers take for-granted today, but we have to remember that modern sound is "standing on the shoulders of giants", LucasArts undoubtedly being one of the giants in the industry.\n\nOverall, Dark Forces II is a very good and innovative title. It introduced many concepts that were never before seen in gaming, and executed them perfectly. The amount of work put into this game is something we don't often see in the cash-cows of today's gaming industry, and it can be clearly seen in the game's immense success.\n\nDark Forces II is a timeless classic that will always be held close to the hearts of Star Wars fans. I highly recommend that you play it, it's an absolutely fantastic game!","May 16, 2013","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

For that, they've earned my respect.\n\nBefore the patch, the game didn't work in fullscreen properly, the music was entirely missing, and was highly prone to crashing. The update has fixed all of these issues. There are still issues with 3D Acceleration mode, limiting you on the color depth, but I'm hoping those will be fixed as well.\n\nBeyond the technical aspects, my review of the game follows:\n\nThis is an old game. It is not a pretty game, and it is not a polished game. It is a very good game for the time, and if you either grew up with it, or can go back and appreciate classic titles, it is well worth full asking price, let alone sale price. I grew up with the Jedi Knight series, so I'm applying a heavy helping of rose-tint nostalgia paste to my goggles.\n\nThat said, it is still a fun, though at times puzzling and confusing game. It's from that era of shooters where we were just starting to experiment with platforming elements and puzzles, and as a result, it can get very frustrating on both.\n\nQuicksave is your friend, you will need it. The Medium and Hard difficulties are brutal, par for the course at the time. Those of you who grew up with 90s-early 2000s PC shooters know what to expect, and the game is a blast if you enjoy that kind of run-and-gun gameplay.\n\nThe story is fairly cheesy, read the accompanying novels, if you can find and stomach them, as they shed light on a lot of details the game glosses over.\n\nOverall, before the update, I probably would only recommend this to hardcore fans of the series, but now that it works out of the box, I think I can recommend it for anyone who's interested in the history of the series or PC gaming in general.","May 6","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Craftian/recommended/32380/","Craftian","Craftian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Craftian/","147 products in account","Dark Forces II was, arguably, one of the best shooters of its day. Provided that you don't mind a bit of effort to get the game up and running properly, the follow-up to the original DOS classic is well worth a look, providing an excellent example of how great a licensed title can be and the capability of its now defunct developer LucasArts.\n\nJedi Knight places you once more in the role of Kyle Katarn, a battle-hardened, side-switching mercenary of the expanded universe. Taking place a short time after the events of Episode VI, a small corrupted faction of the Empire's remnants known as the Dark Jedi are in pursuit of the legendary Valley of the Jedi and the unstoppable power that it supposedly grants. With an obvious interest in tracking them down, the inevitable confrontation allows you a chance to avenge the death of his family.\n\nA huge step-up in terms of narrative alone, JK is also a significant depature from its predecessor in most respects. Levels are now bigger and more sprawling than ever but not baffling to explore, and there are plenty of hidden surprises across the various locations of the campaign. Sound is no longer technically limited by the MIDI format of the early '90s and John Williams' score plays on top of all the classic sound effects taken straight from the films. Combat is more refined and easy to get into and enjoy, with an impressive range of weapons on offer rather than an over-reliance on the Stormtrooper's blaster rifle or thermal detonators. The introduction of lightsaber combat is also worthy of note, though is admittedly prone to clunky, hack-and-slash gameplay.\n\nUnlike the atrocious in-engine rendering of Mysteries of the Sith, JK uses the classic (almost nostalgic) combination of live-action and early CGI to establish the fairly well written narrative during the frequent (and occasionally lengthy) cutscenes. Most of the cast seemed to have thoroughly enjoyed acting in them and in-game dialogue uses the same high quality voices, which is a nice touch.\n\nAs one who has never been that invested or interested in Star Wars, (I've only seen the six episodes once and have little interest in the reboots), I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable this turned out to be. Having picked up the entire Jedi Knight collection and Battlefront II during the recent sale, it's encouraging to see licensed titles that are actually decent and, more to the point, satisfying to play.\n\nThe game certainly does have compatibility issues, (considering it's age), and requires a decent amount of time to tweak, fix and optimise for modern PCs. Yet it is a relatively straight-forward process and there a plenty of excellent guides and tutorials available in the community hub here to help you get it going.\n\nAs a result, I really can recommend Jedi Knight - Dark Forces II; a shooter that caters to pretty much everyone. It is a vastly superior experience compared to the first yet still retains the depth and style of it's now non-canon lore. Star Wars fans will have an absolute blast playing through this, undoubtedly coming back for more playthroughs, and for those such as myself, it provides an excellent example of the '90s shooter and a worthy alternative to Doom or Quake. Thumbs up.","May 9","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Still have the original cd-rom, from 1997. Found it in a bargin bin for $7.99 in 2003. Best purchase I ever made.\n\nGraphically it was crap (like old school N64) even back then, but it's gameplay mechanics can still hold it's own. Huge levels to explore. Good variety of weapons. Lightsabers! Plus you can save whenever you want to! Why in 2015, are there first person shooters that still use the check point system, instead of being able to save anywhere? The actors were so-so but still better than a lot the games that are released nowadays. Why does it feature a better soundtrack than the Force Unleashed?\n\nThat said, I can't recommend buying this game or it's expansion on steam. Hasn't been properly patched for modern machines, so it plays like total crap.

It features The Valley of the Jedi which is the foundation of the lore in the upcoming games.\n\nThe story is very, very driven by the actors in the cutscenes, and these cutscenes are the only ones in FMV throughout the series. FMV was a thing of the mid 90's and it really works in these games.\n\nDark Forces II was a part of my childhood and I have a lot of nostalgia attached to it. That being said, the game has not aged too well. A lot of the levels are fun and you can use both a lightsaber and force powers. Both of these are no where near perfected and Dark Forces II is one of the few games with force powers that you can complete without using Force Powers a single time.\n\nThe system where you choose Force Powers is not perfect (you don't even HAVE to choose a single power if you don't want to) and the fact that the number of Secret Areas you discover determine the overall number of "Force Stars" is just a dumb idea.\n\nThumbs up for the fact that you can choose between Light vs Dark side, but other than that... no it is not the best aged of games. The graphics are really bad on your own character model, but work better on for instance Storm Troopers. Sound effects are really good, but the overall level design is just not on par with many other games from the era - such as Quake II.\n\nThe Jedi boss battles are really, really not good. The clunky design of the lightsaber just makes these battles forgettable. The actors are however very good and each jedi has maybe the best personalities of the whole series because of this. Gameplay is, however lacking.\n\nIt is, on the other hand, short and gives a good back story to the following 2 games in the series. The actors are likable and the "evil ending" features a really cool cutscene.\n\nSummary:\n\nPositive\n+ Nostalgia value\n+ FMV Cutscenes\n+ Force Powers\n+ Sound effects\n+ Somewhat cool story\n+ Actors\n\nNegative\n- Graphics\n- Level design\n- Jedi Fights\n- Overall Gameplay\n\nSummary\nIf you want a back story to the following games, or if you like retro gaming this is the thing for you. Otherwise.... check out the cutscenes on YouTube before playing Jedi Knight II.","May 6, 2015","true","4.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

While the graphics aren't aged well and people who can't tolerate pixels won't appriciate it for that, it's story is amazing( the cutscenes are so good, almost like a real Star Wars movie) and the combat is just awesome. I've played only 4 hours on this so far, but holy ♥♥♥♥, i see myself completeing this game multiple times since you can either be Evil or Good. Now I hear that it's a mess to make it work on Windows 7 and Windows 8, but I'm using linux, and It works without any problems, just install the windows version of steam on linux and it should work. Crashes are somewhat rare, but thankfully you can quicksave in this game, so a crash once a couple of hours don't affect me. haven't tested the multiplayer yet, but I doubt anyone is still playing this. Too bad, because it's an amazing game. First Person Shooter fans and Star Wars fans should get it asap.\n\n\nTL;DR  -  Get it, now. Especially if you're not using Windows 7 and 8","October 21, 2014","true","12.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Released in 1997, this game ushered in a new era of gaming, specifically for the first person shooter, that was predicated by games such as Quake and Wolfenstein where simply running and gunning was the only play style that counted.  Then came Dark Forces II and its ability to deliver gaming narrative, something that had not previously been seen in the shooter genre, with interactive storytelling through live action cut scenes and a storyline that could actually be influenced based upon your actions throughout the game.  While this aspect was great, the gameplay itself carrys Jedi Knight far as well.  With solid controls, impressive sounds and music that come direct from the Star Wars universe, great visuals for a game released in 1997, and an array of weapons and powers that create multiple play sytles and tactics, Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II is a game that continues to stand the test of time.  Thanks to it, games such as Half-Life and the like (the story based shooter) were able to become a legitimized powerhouse in the gaming community and continue to rule the shooter community.  Very much worth the $4.99 Steam price tag.  May the Force be with you!","March 1, 2014","true","14.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game has not aged well, in the slightest. The jedi experience is poorer than bantha fodder, dried under the Tatooine sun. The overall lack of oomph in force powers makes you facepalm, but it's nothing compared to the double facepalm that is the lightsaber. The moment you whip it out for testing, it just screams "IT'S A TRAP!". So you fall back on your "uncivilized" weaponry (which feels pretty *MEH* too) and combined with your force powers, you continue blasting things away, while admiring the amazing level design (which was praised and critically acclaimed during its time, and still holds up in this day and age, if you ask me!) and live action cutscenes along the way.\n\nDespite the appalling negatives in the above paragraph, there is a fair to great amount of fun to be had in this game, due to the enormous amount of community mods. One in particular, Saber Battle X, gives a jedi experience that is albeit, not very fancy, but quite fun and challenging. The neutral force powers actually give Jedi Outcast/Academy a run for its money. There are also several dozen deathmatch mods that have some very fun and interesting weapons as well. There is also no shortage of maps either. You could spend dozens upon dozens of hours playing through all the maps that are available. Sure, getting a group of friends together to experience all this content is a longshot, but these gems exist and await any who dare to give them a look-see!\n\nwww.Massassi.net hosts most of the said mods & maps.","April 23, 2014","true","3.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

To this day I still have my copy of the game in working condition.\n\n**Story Info|Possible Spoilers**\nThe game is set one year after the events of Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. Former mercenary Kyle Katarn meets an info broker droid named 8t88 who informs Katarn that is father, Morgan, was killed by Jerec, a Dark Jedi with plans of rebuilding the Empire. Kyle is given a disk from 8t88 that only a droid in his father's home can read. Kyle Katarn sets out to find this droid and put an end to Jerec's plans to keep the galaxy at peace.\n\n**Gameplay**\nDark Forces II much like its predecessor is a First Person Shooter, but now you are given the option to use a 3rd person camera if you so desire. The main game is divided into 21 levels, each with an objective and are completed in order.\nGiven at your disposal are various weapons, explosives, and various force powers categorized as Light Side or Dark. later on you'll get a lightsaber after finding Morgan Katarn's droid.\nThe lightsaber combat in Dark Forces II is very primitive and therefore feels dated. You can swing the saber diagonally left and right standing in place, swing in the direction you are moving, do a "fury" attack when moving forward, and a power attack using right-click on the mouse.\nThe gameplay overall is slightly dated, but I think still holds up to today.\n\n**Graphics**\nDo not expect the graphics to be outstanding! Since this is a game from 1997, the graphics are blocky, pixelated, and at times messy. However, for 1997 standards, it's good for its time... Assuming you are not playing it with the 3D Hardware Acceleration disabled, then it just looks bad.\n\n**Verdict**\nStar Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II is still a blast to play 17 years later, but don't be surprised by its dated feeling. I consider it to be up there with my personal top 5 Star Wars games. As a guy who has been playing it all his life, I definitely recommend you get this game. This is not one you should pass up!","August 22, 2014","true","5.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Which side you choose will determine the outcome of the story (Light side is canon in the series of games). You get 10 different weapons ranging from fists to rail gun to lightsaber.\nThere are a number of boss fights versus Dark Jedi which can be pretty challenging if you don't know how to beat them (for example the neutral Force Seeing ability will make the second boss fight a lot easier).\nYou also travel to different planets starting with Nar Shaddaa.\nBeware of the scary squid on level 4.

It's still fun and has fantastic gunplay, however, the lightsaber isn't that satisfying to use and force powers come without explination. The live action fmv cutscenes are also riddled with bad acting and cringey dialog. The story isn't the best either.\n\nI didn't feel like the badass mercenary working for the rebels on his terms only in this game. And I didn't feel all that much like a jedi either.

Of course, it's a worthy sequel to Dark Forces and an excellent transition to a tridimensional engine. The graphics are very weird and too "pointy" even for its time. The gameplay is very fast paced, and eventually you get your own lightsaber to hack enemies away! Of course, like its predecessor, there are some levels in which the level design makes no sense whatsoever, and some impacient folks will probably skip to a walkthrough. The FMV cutscenes are very weird but kinda cool, I guess.\n\nDo I recommend buying it here on Steam? Not so much. This game is notorious for having compatibility issues on every Windows that came after XP, so prepare to lose some time testing fixes, patches and whatever the hell else to get the game working. I would recommend that you get it a very, very low price, like I did, so in case you can't run it, at least you won't be losing too much money.

Didn't age well and almost all levels feels like a maze. There's a level I spend one hour to find a freaking button small as a pixel to deactivate a door shield! Running around like a crazy mofo to find the exit of the level and I wanted to give up.\n\nThere's many levels you need to search and have to die to find the freaking answer to go further. When it's not that, the A.I are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s shooting with Concussion Rifles, they spam you with it very far far away killing you like in three hits. If you do survive that then the gravity will do the job, dying by falling. I was playing in normal difficulty and felt I was doing hard or even higher.\n\nSomething that really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, mines, dev's put them everywhere and never where you expect them. The surface of the water in this game is a texture, you can't see what's under it, in chapter 6 I think, somewhere there's a place with water that sort of points you that you need to go underwater to proceed, so your thought will be "Maybe it's a secret or a passage"  You go forward and bip! bip! bip! BOOOM!!! you're dead! Sometimes they put like 5 mines together and if one explode then the rest will, you can't survive that explosion.\n\nIf you forget to save then you will start all over, checkpoints don't exist, no mercy either. You do want to be careful but me I love to run in all games, this one is risky, If you thought that because it's old and fast paced thinking be able to go fast and do crazy ♥♥♥♥ like Quake, Wrong! You just can't. Well unless you don't care and love hearing Kyle screaming when dying, then go ahead, please.\n\nCutscenes are made with real actors and their actings is so bad, that doesn't matter because it's funny, it's like watching the movie The Room from Tommy Wiseau, it's so bad it's good kind of way. you can still skip it though.\n\nThere's things you need to know before buying, when you will launch the first time you might not be able to play, everything will be made of a rainbow. you'll need to search for fixes, patchs, mods, lots of ♥♥♥♥ to make it work, ATI, Nvidia, I tried both. Steam version there's no soundtrack, I would recommend to get the gog version instead, it's going to work first try.\n\nEven though I don't like this game anymore, it will be always a joy to play it for nostalgic reasons, I'm not saying the game is extremly bad, but it's not a good game either, it's just decent. Overall I give it a 5 out of 10.","December 30, 2015","false","22.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Along the way, Kyle discovers his latent connection to the Force and recieves a Lightsaber, allowing players the opportunity to play with a lightsaber for the first time in Star Wars Gaming History.\n\nToo bad this game is broken on Steam.

Although it hasn't aged well at all, it is an instant classic along with its predecessor Dark Forces. Featuring very fast paced and fun FPS action, and very well made lightsaber combat for a game of its type once you first get your Lightsaber, it can be very fun to play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/256color/recommended/32380/","256color","michael","http://steamcommunity.com/id/256color/","315 products in account","I don't think that Steam version of this game can give new players a chance to understand why is it a great game. First, there is no music - and music is so important here. Second - to run it properly, one has to go at some lengths.\n\nBut this title was extraordinary at its time for numerous reasons, and the biggest advantage is immersive and addictive gameplay. Paradoxically so, because graphics are pretty bad. But not many people remember that this game was out when 3D accelerators were still not something to take for granted. I first played Jedi Knight in the software renderer mode, and believe me, without 3D accelerator it looked better than any other title of the time. But the biggest thing about this game, as I think of it now, is its silence. You know, modern games are afraid to leave you alone, there are always some NPCs yelling at you, your guide telling you where to go, hints, messages and directions pop up from everywhere... It doesn't let you sink deep into the story and feel like you're there. But JK is the opposite. You are always on your own, which is emphasised by the gigantic proportions of the levels. The classic John Williams' score is tastefully woven into the atmosphere and is changing dynamically to make it even more dramatic. The cutscenes tie the story together and it all makes sense, you are no longer wandering from checkpoint to checkpoint for some obscure reasons, killing people; you always know your mission. Plus to that you carry the responsibility for your actions - the way you play will define your fate - become a Jedi or be consumed by the dark side of the Force. Add to it a lightsaber, the Force powers, and you forget about the graphics, and feel like it is all happening to you.","December 18, 2010","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/The_CrY/recommended/32380/","The_CrY","The_CrY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/The_CrY/","231 products in account","Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II is the first game to ever allow you to play as a Jedi with actual Force powers, but so far the only one to combine it with old school FPS and a enthralling storyline. While the old engine certainly has its limits and leaves a lot to be desired in terms of eye candy, the leveldesign and ambience of the total experience is far superiour to games like Jedi Academy or The Force Unleashed. Of course, this is also the only game in the entire franchise that allows you to choose between the Light and Dark Side, based on your actions in the preceding levels. So on the crucial moment, it's not as if you make a 180 degrees turn, like in Jedi Academy, but you are instead just following the path you had already descended upon.\n\nThe leveldesign is totally old school FPS. It contains platforming puzzles; many secrets (I still haven't found them all) and easter eggs; and, of course, a freedom to travel as you please. Some of the levels therefore are a true maze, such as "Palace Escape" or "The Return Home to Sulon". In both cases you can travel into multiple directions without running into places the game doesn't want you to be, which gives a sense of freedom. The platforming puzzles are sometimes simple cases where you must jump at the proper moment, like in "Double-Cross on Nar Shaddaa"; sometimes the puzzles rely on your Force powers like Force Speed or Force Jump, like in "Into the Dark Palace", which means you can't go on if you have forgotten to upgrade those powers. In other cases, there are physics puzzles to solve, like in the "Fuel Station Launch" level. Hidden within the levels are many hidden areas, some more obvious than others, which adds to the replay value. And on top of all this, there is a lot of variety in the leveldesign. You never have the feeling some tricks are repeated all the time, with the exception of the lightsabre duels, which brings us to a new subject.\n\nThe old engine has its obvious limits. Aside from not looking too well, especially not for modern standards, the game mechanics are hopelessly outdated as well. The most obvious problem is the addition of Force powers. While these work smoothly in later games, this game still kind of struggles with the concept of being a Jedi. Once you get the hang of it, it's endless fun, but until such fortune, you will likely wonder why your lightsabre doesn't make you a bit more invincible than it should. Force Jump still requires specific activation in this game, making it hard to control direction and height. Force Pull is limited to items, so you can't Pull enemies over. There is no Force Push yet, which is sincerely missed. Force Blinding and Persuasion generate the same effect, but Persuasion is much more effective, making Blinding obsolete. Force Lightning also is hard to control and slightly disappointing in effect. The lightsabre has limited ways of hitting the enemy, resulting in you sometimes losing a lot of health to a single stormtrooper because you don't manage to hit him while he's standing still. Combined with the right Force powers however, your level of invincibility will rise to endless heights. If you can overcome and accept the limits of the engine, none of these problems will ruin gameplay, but instead make it more challenging.\n\nThe variety of enemies and your arsenal of weapons also do not disappoint. Naturally, you grow tired of shooting Gran and Rodian thugs after a few levels, but once you reach "Into the Dark Palace" you will battle actual stormtroopers, Imperial officers and AT-STs. Other hired guns are Trandoshan bounty hunters armed with deadly concussion rifles. And be careful not to run into the monstrous Kell Dragons! And of course the seven Dark Jedi led by Jerec. You can battle most of them with your lightsabre, which is of course the most fun weapon in the game, regardless of its limitations, but the other weapons are not less useful. You can choose from simple sidearms like the Bryar Pistol, but there's classics like the Wookiee Bowcaster or the Imperial Repeater. Even Thermal Detonators can be used to blow up your enemies, and when heavy fire power is necessary you may even call upon the Rail Charger or the Concussion Rifle. The latter weapon has some quirky effects, but once you see its devastating power you will soon forget about that.\n\nOne last element that makes this game as awesome as it is, is the storyline. Without spoiling too much, you are Kyle Katarn and you are chasing the droid 8t88 in order to find your dead father's message, which he left for you. He instructs you to follow Jerec, who is in search of the Valley of the Jedi; a place in which hundreds of souls of dead Jedi and Sith are trapped. Jerec intends to absorb their power and become invincible. Of course, he must be stopped. On your way, you'll meet his six servants, all of them with their own unique character and duelling style. Yun is the insecure apprentice, whose loyalties are uncertain; Pic and Gorc are two genetically engineered Sithspawn who always battle together; Maw is pure hatred and muscle and has the unique feature to be able to fly, which makes for an interesting duel; Sariss is cunning and strong with the mental side of the Force; Boc is annoying as hell; and Jerec of course is the mastermind. You can tell by the way I describe the lot that I am pretty fond of them. A game that can achieve that has a great ambience. So unlike in the follow-up titles, Dark Forces II features a very fascinating and realistic storyline within the confines of the Star Wars universe. For the full experience, I would recommend the Dark Forces Trilogy novellas written by William C. Dietz, because those books provide the full background story to the game and each character.\n\nTo wrap this up, Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II is hands down the best Star Wars game ever released. The graphic aspect of the game is obviously outdated, but the storyline and the ability to wield the Force are the most important aspects of a Star Wars game. Combine the exceptional storyline with the old school leveldesign and the variety within the enemies, levels and weapons, and the verdict can be nothing but positive. I would recommend this game to all fellow Star Wars geeks!","August 14, 2014","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I'll try my best to list the good points and the bad.\n\nI should note I finished the game in 9 hours, getting most of the secrets and watching all cutscenes.\n\nThings I liked:\n\nThe music. The score comes straight from the films, so it's always going to be fantastic. This is of course if you choose to install the music with a patch, it dosen't come with the Steam version as standard.\n\nThe story. This is one of my favourite Star Wars stories, maybe it's the haunting voice of Rahn from the cutscene's or the fact all the bosses are genuinely interesting. I like the whole notion of the Valley of the Jedi.\n\nThe cutscene's. Let's be honest, alot of why this game was so popular was the live action cutscene, which were of the quality of something from the films. Wonderful actors like Jason Court bring the whole game to life.\n\nHere's some things I didn't like:\n\nI had trouble getting the game running well on new systems. There's some great guides to help you out there mind.\n\nThe cutscenes, for me, would only show in a small boarder window. I mean at least I got to watch them, but it's not ideal.\n\nAs I've already noted, the game does not come with the original music, you'll have to add it in a patch (it's well worth it)\n\nAs a shooter the game holds up very well, infact it's better than most modern day shooters. If you're worried because you've looked at the sceenshots and you're wondering if you could adapt to such an older game, I'd advise giving it a go.\nBut you should be warned, as most buying will most likely be running the game on newer systems, you may need to do some fiddling around to get the game running.\n\nTruely a timeless cassic, if you're willing to get past it's age.","August 22, 2014","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like most of the Dark Forces/Jedi Knight series after this point, you find yourself wanting to defeat enemies using a combination of the lightsaber and force powers.\n\nGraphically, this feels somehow worse than the previous game (with the XL engine) due to the fact that you are switching from pretty sprites to blocky poly's, although its technically much improved.\n\nWork your way through the first few levels with guns (and even fists to start with) until you get your lightsaber and force powers. From then on you must allocate your force points and then you may use various force powers (14 to choose from) to help you on your way. You can continue using your regular weapons, and sometimes they are somewhat required, but its much more fun zooming around slicing at people with a glowing energy sword.\n\nI had various issues running the game, most of which were fixed by going here: http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Jedi_Knight_%E2%80%93_Dark_Forces_II\n\n\n\n","March 11, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/recommended/32380/","espresso651","Espresso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/","281 products in account","This is one of my all-time favorite games.  Seriously one of the best gaming experiences I ever had.  The Steam release, however, is not a good presentation of the game.\n\nIn Jedi Knight, the sequel to Dark Forces, you once again play as Kyle Katarn, a mercenary sometimes employed by the Rebels.  His father, once a Jedi who left the order, is killed for a secret he kept by a group of dark jedi.  Kyle must avenge his father and stop Jerec from rising to power as an omnipotent new Sith lord\n\nThis game stood apart from the FPS games of its time because of some innovations.  The use of a lightsaber, which serves as both an offensive and defensive weapon, was a bit deal.  Lots of games had melee weapons, but the lightsaber handled differently.  The force powers let you do things you could not do in any other FPS.  A rudimentary morality system allowed you to kill NPCs to change the outcome of the game, in an attempt to add a role-playing aspect.\n\nAs an FPS the game is satisfying enough.  There is actually a good story, told through cheesily acted cut scenes that still are more Star Wars than the prequels.  I find the focus of the Single Player campaign less about perfect aim (some of the weapons are kind of random, actually), but on cleverness and reflexes.  More often than not, the game insists on a stealth approach to some fights.  Like DF, JK is more interested in mental puzzles than being yet another Doom.  Every once in awhile, the game takes a break from the FPS mold for one-one-one (sometimes more) Jedi battles.\n\nThe game really shined in Multiplayer, though, back in its heyday.  A thriving mod community (thanks to a simple modification system) expanded on the already great gameplay.  Fighting an AI with a saber and force powers was one thing, playing a deathmatch against fully-powered Jedis was something amazing.\n\nUnfortunately, this release, the Steam version, is not that version of the game.  Single Player is intact, with the exception of the music, which was redbook audio of John Williams' score.  It does leave something lacking to the campaign, as a result.  The Multiplayer system no longer works at all.  While this is not Steam's fault, it is something you should be aware when buying the game.  With the exception of painstaking modification and router configuration, this is now a single player game.  Which is a crying shame.\n\nThe executable for the game is also not always compatible with some patches and mods.  It can be frustrating trying to get the game to work with customizations.\n\nNot all of the differences are bad, though.  The Steam version defaults to a windows GUI for menus, which might seem annoying, but addresses a bug in the original version of the game.  Instead of manually setting the workaround, Steam auto-applies it.  The game contols have been changed to WASD as default, as well.  And while this is not exclusive to Steam's release, this also applies to retail, the game has full native Widescreen support, and always has.  This seems a bit unusual for a 1997 game.\n\nThe two sequels that followed were worthy successors, but this was one of the best titles LucasArts made in their heyday.  It's definitely worth playing if you've never experienced it before.","February 13, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/The_CrY/recommended/32380/","The_CrY","The_CrY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/The_CrY/","231 products in account","Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II is the first game to ever allow you to play as a Jedi with actual Force powers, but so far the only one to combine it with old school FPS and a enthralling storyline. While the old engine certainly has its limits and leaves a lot to be desired in terms of eye candy, the leveldesign and ambience of the total experience is far superiour to games like Jedi Academy or The Force Unleashed. Of course, this is also the only game in the entire franchise that allows you to choose between the Light and Dark Side, based on your actions in the preceding levels. So on the crucial moment, it's not as if you make a 180 degrees turn, like in Jedi Academy, but you are instead just following the path you had already descended upon.\n\nThe leveldesign is totally old school FPS. It contains platforming puzzles; many secrets (I still haven't found them all) and easter eggs; and, of course, a freedom to travel as you please. Some of the levels therefore are a true maze, such as "Palace Escape" or "The Return Home to Sulon". In both cases you can travel into multiple directions without running into places the game doesn't want you to be, which gives a sense of freedom. The platforming puzzles are sometimes simple cases where you must jump at the proper moment, like in "Double-Cross on Nar Shaddaa"; sometimes the puzzles rely on your Force powers like Force Speed or Force Jump, like in "Into the Dark Palace", which means you can't go on if you have forgotten to upgrade those powers. In other cases, there are physics puzzles to solve, like in the "Fuel Station Launch" level. Hidden within the levels are many hidden areas, some more obvious than others, which adds to the replay value. And on top of all this, there is a lot of variety in the leveldesign. You never have the feeling some tricks are repeated all the time, with the exception of the lightsabre duels, which brings us to a new subject.\n\nThe old engine has its obvious limits. Aside from not looking too well, especially not for modern standards, the game mechanics are hopelessly outdated as well. The most obvious problem is the addition of Force powers. While these work smoothly in later games, this game still kind of struggles with the concept of being a Jedi. Once you get the hang of it, it's endless fun, but until such fortune, you will likely wonder why your lightsabre doesn't make you a bit more invincible than it should. Force Jump still requires specific activation in this game, making it hard to control direction and height. Force Pull is limited to items, so you can't Pull enemies over. There is no Force Push yet, which is sincerely missed. Force Blinding and Persuasion generate the same effect, but Persuasion is much more effective, making Blinding obsolete. Force Lightning also is hard to control and slightly disappointing in effect. The lightsabre has limited ways of hitting the enemy, resulting in you sometimes losing a lot of health to a single stormtrooper because you don't manage to hit him while he's standing still. Combined with the right Force powers however, your level of invincibility will rise to endless heights. If you can overcome and accept the limits of the engine, none of these problems will ruin gameplay, but instead make it more challenging.\n\nThe variety of enemies and your arsenal of weapons also do not disappoint. Naturally, you grow tired of shooting Gran and Rodian thugs after a few levels, but once you reach "Into the Dark Palace" you will battle actual stormtroopers, Imperial officers and AT-STs. Other hired guns are Trandoshan bounty hunters armed with deadly concussion rifles. And be careful not to run into the monstrous Kell Dragons! And of course the seven Dark Jedi led by Jerec. You can battle most of them with your lightsabre, which is of course the most fun weapon in the game, regardless of its limitations, but the other weapons are not less useful. You can choose from simple sidearms like the Bryar Pistol, but there's classics like the Wookiee Bowcaster or the Imperial Repeater. Even Thermal Detonators can be used to blow up your enemies, and when heavy fire power is necessary you may even call upon the Rail Charger or the Concussion Rifle. The latter weapon has some quirky effects, but once you see its devastating power you will soon forget about that.\n\nOne last element that makes this game as awesome as it is, is the storyline. Without spoiling too much, you are Kyle Katarn and you are chasing the droid 8t88 in order to find your dead father's message, which he left for you. He instructs you to follow Jerec, who is in search of the Valley of the Jedi; a place in which hundreds of souls of dead Jedi and Sith are trapped. Jerec intends to absorb their power and become invincible. Of course, he must be stopped. On your way, you'll meet his six servants, all of them with their own unique character and duelling style. Yun is the insecure apprentice, whose loyalties are uncertain; Pic and Gorc are two genetically engineered Sithspawn who always battle together; Maw is pure hatred and muscle and has the unique feature to be able to fly, which makes for an interesting duel; Sariss is cunning and strong with the mental side of the Force; Boc is annoying as hell; and Jerec of course is the mastermind. You can tell by the way I describe the lot that I am pretty fond of them. A game that can achieve that has a great ambience. So unlike in the follow-up titles, Dark Forces II features a very fascinating and realistic storyline within the confines of the Star Wars universe. For the full experience, I would recommend the Dark Forces Trilogy novellas written by William C. Dietz, because those books provide the full background story to the game and each character.\n\nTo wrap this up, Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II is hands down the best Star Wars game ever released. The graphic aspect of the game is obviously outdated, but the storyline and the ability to wield the Force are the most important aspects of a Star Wars game. Combine the exceptional storyline with the old school leveldesign and the variety within the enemies, levels and weapons, and the verdict can be nothing but positive. I would recommend this game to all fellow Star Wars geeks!","August 14, 2014","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The score comes straight from the films, so it's always going to be fantastic. This is of course if you choose to install the music with a patch, it dosen't come with the Steam version as standard.\n\nThe story. This is one of my favourite Star Wars stories, maybe it's the haunting voice of Rahn from the cutscene's or the fact all the bosses are genuinely interesting. I like the whole notion of the Valley of the Jedi.\n\nThe cutscene's. Let's be honest, alot of why this game was so popular was the live action cutscene, which were of the quality of something from the films. Wonderful actors like Jason Court bring the whole game to life.\n\nHere's some things I didn't like:\n\nI had trouble getting the game running well on new systems. There's some great guides to help you out there mind.\n\nThe cutscenes, for me, would only show in a small boarder window. I mean at least I got to watch them, but it's not ideal.\n\nAs I've already noted, the game does not come with the original music, you'll have to add it in a patch (it's well worth it)\n\nAs a shooter the game holds up very well, infact it's better than most modern day shooters. If you're worried because you've looked at the sceenshots and you're wondering if you could adapt to such an older game, I'd advise giving it a go.\nBut you should be warned, as most buying will most likely be running the game on newer systems, you may need to do some fiddling around to get the game running.\n\nTruely a timeless cassic, if you're willing to get past it's age.","August 22, 2014","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game follows the events of Return of the Jedi, as you play as Kyle Katarn, the hero from Dark Forces who sent the Death Star plans to Princess Leia, and stopped the Dark Trooper project.  This time he's back and discovers he's force sensitive and is out to stop the Dark Jedi  Jerec from taking the power from the Valley of the Jedi, (where all the dead Jedi's force energy goes. Like Anakin, Yoda, Obi-Wan, Mace Windu, Qui-Gon, etc...) As a huge Star Wars fan, I enjoyed this game while I was growing up, and I have fond memories with this.  With the release on Steam, I was able to see if it still holds up.  And, it most certainly does.  The graphics have been improved since the first game, and the ability to weild a lightsaber, and force powers is quite fun.  The enviroments are massive and the secrets are welll hidden.  Not many games today have those elements.  While future games Jedi Outcast (my personal favorite of the series,) and Jedi Academy advanced this is what started it all.  If you have not played thos game, please do.  It is one of the greatest first person shooters of all time.  Even if you are not a fan of the Star Wars franchise, this is still worth a shot.

Running this game without any sort of external fix on Win 8.1 was a nightmare! Menus ran only in windowed mode, and the actual game ran in a full-screen window (the menu bar was visible but it's fullscreen) at a terrible resolution.\n\nThat's if it ran at all! The game crashed repeatedly and randomly, so you will probably not be able to even beat the first level. Besides crashing, I had a bug where the weapon would just spazz out when I am running, and just go insane when I switched it. It was comical, but it definitely adds to the game being unplayable.\n\nLuckily, there's lots and lots of fixes for the game that will fix the game... In theory! I have been going through the Community forums to try out all sorts of patches and fixes, but to no avail. Many people have gotten it to work, but others weren't as lucky (like me).\n\nThing is, you can get this game on GoG and their version is optimized. I purchased that version too after hearing that it works better than the Steam version, and I was able to beat the first three missions, so I can attest to it working... Mostly. The game crashed once, but it hasn't had any problems since then. The game also runs at fullscreen, though changing the resolution causes the game to crash as well. Still, if you want to play Dark Forces II, go for that version as it is at least playable.\n\nThis version though?

The ones I had- with 3d acceleration on game screen goes crazy and only things I could see were shattered and stretched textures- in my case none of community fixes worked; some random (but luckily quite rare) game crashes, usually after saving game in menu. It's a pity it wasn't properly fixed when released on Steam...\n\nI really enjoyed coming back to this game after years. It may look weird right now but if you also played it back in end of 90s you should not care ;) It has one of nicests gameplays I've experienced.\nLike Star Wars universe? Or do not like but like good action games with story with little bit of building the character? Or maybe you like oldschool games more than modern ones? Go for it :)\nFor modern players it can be too difficult (no auto healing, shield recharge or infinite ammo, sorry), not everyone may like this ascetic style of old 3d games, but hey, try it. If it's too much for you try SW: Jedi Outcast which is more eye-friendly and inherits everything the best from Dark Forces II.\nOne thing I didn't like like- no music. In original version of Dark Forces II music was on game cd in audio format played during the game. Pity the soundtrack wasn't included in this Steam version.\n\nTo sum up:\n-game is great :) note it's oldstyle, so not everyone may like it\n-you may experience some tech problems, but game is fully playable, so don't worry. You will have this problem also with orginal cd version on modern PCs.\n-no soundtrack? why? :(\n","December 21, 2014","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is strong.   The levels are fairly large even by today's standards.\n\nThe downside?   Unless you're running a fairly old video card (not as old as this game, but at least 5 years), you probably won't be able to run it 3D accelerated.   The chunky textures aren't that bad, but it would have been nice to see the textures blended a little.  Checking off the 3D accelerated setting will just cause the game to lock up for a minute and crash to the desktop.\n\nAlso, cut scenes and menu screens are, oddly, rendered at the native 640x480, so they open in a small window in one corner of the screen.\n\nBy modern standards, I give it a solid C grade.   It's a good game, but there's a certain expectation when a game is put back on the market that it'll be modified to function properly on the mainstream hardware of today.    I already own the boxed version of the game, and when it went on Steam, I expected them to have fixed those problems before putting it up for sale again.

But then I thought about it... and thought about it some more, and I only went back on a few things. I do now recommend this game now to casual and Star Wars gamers, but I still think that Jerec and Yun are terribly acted in the live-action cutscenes. Kyle, Jan, and even Boc are actually interesting. The moral system I think is total wank, still. Seriously? I kill one man accidentally, and two seconds later I am evil enough to kill my best friend. And the Dark Side story particularly is a lot more sloppily put together than the Light Side, after the story's big fork in the road. So many times it jumped from one scenario to the next, with no explanation at all. But still, the gameplay is greatly improved, lightsaber combat (while it can be very repetitive. All you do is click) can be rewarding at times. The boss battles are decent. The voice acting's fine.

They are either lacking and uninteresting in their gameplay or just a mindless run-and-gun game.\nRare are the games where the action is fast-paced, but not too fast or bugged. Gameplay that is fluid and quick, but not mindless.\n\nFor this reason, older games are often a breath of fresh air, as was the case with this game. I got this game through a Humble Bundle, and I am very pleased that I did.\n\nThe levels are fun and well thought out, making you think about what you are doing and how you are going to move forward. You also have to pay attention to detail, or risk spending time searching for that lever or button that will get you moving to the next area. At the same time movement is quick, ensuring that the levels don't drag out and get boring and tedious.\n\nThe action itself is much like newer games. There's a good spread of different weapons, although I tended to prefer the lightsaber once I god it. It was great fun slashing through my opponents. The boss fights are, at normal difficutly, easy and satisfying at the same time. The only exception to this was the final boss fight that was somewhat drawn out and got boring towards the end. Without spoiling anything, the endings depend on how you play and I felt that it made up for the somewhat crap boss fight.\nI never really used the force powers much, except for Force Jump. I did use some in the final boss fight, but the actions is more than good enough without the powers and I had a great time blasting and slashing my opponents.\n\nThis game has the benefit of being a Star Wars game, and therefore able to use the appropriate music. I rarely enjoy the in-game music as much as I did in this game. The music itself is fantastic, well-timed and just that little bit extra that makes this game even greater. A lot of the time I was actually listening to, and enjoying the music as it really set the mood for a specific situation or level.\nTowards the middle of the game I had constant flashbacks to the Nintendo 64 Star Wars game. Good times.\n\nThe graphics arent all that great, which is also obvious from the screenshots in the store page. That being said, I got used to it very quickly, and after about 10 minuts I wasn't offering that graphics a thoght. It felt just as natural as when playing Crysis or any other game (not that I enjoyed Crysis anywhere near as much as this game).\nAlso worth a mentions is the cutscenes. I really like this style of doing them and wish more games would do the same.\n\n\nAll in all, this is a very good game and I recommend it to any fans of FPS or Star Wars games without hesitation.\n\n\nBe aware that Steam has also been sloppy (again) and the game doesn't work 100%. A few levels in, the game started asking me for CD2 in order to play cutscenes. Naturally, I didn't have one as this is a digital Steam copy, and therefore I had to watch youtube every time I wanted to see the cutscenes which sucks because the cutscenes are awesome, and in the finale you have to find the right video or risk confusion and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ness.\nI do believe there are some other issues with the Steam version as well, but I didn't really notice (or care).\nI got this through a bundle so I didn't really care about the smaller issues that the Steam version has, but if you want a better version you might want to take a look at the one being sold on Good Old Games. Rumour has it that GOG has a better version.\n\nAlso note that the main menu and cutscenes of the game will always be showed in a small window. I don't believe this is related to the Steam version, but rather the fact that this game wasn't designed to run on the hardware we use today.\nThe game itself is always full-screen and works perfectly.\n\n","February 28, 2015","true","28.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/recommended/32380/","espresso651","Espresso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/","281 products in account","This is one of my all-time favorite games.  Seriously one of the best gaming experiences I ever had.  The Steam release, however, is not a good presentation of the game.\n\nIn Jedi Knight, the sequel to Dark Forces, you once again play as Kyle Katarn, a mercenary sometimes employed by the Rebels.  His father, once a Jedi who left the order, is killed for a secret he kept by a group of dark jedi.  Kyle must avenge his father and stop Jerec from rising to power as an omnipotent new Sith lord\n\nThis game stood apart from the FPS games of its time because of some innovations.  The use of a lightsaber, which serves as both an offensive and defensive weapon, was a bit deal.  Lots of games had melee weapons, but the lightsaber handled differently.  The force powers let you do things you could not do in any other FPS.  A rudimentary morality system allowed you to kill NPCs to change the outcome of the game, in an attempt to add a role-playing aspect.\n\nAs an FPS the game is satisfying enough.  There is actually a good story, told through cheesily acted cut scenes that still are more Star Wars than the prequels.  I find the focus of the Single Player campaign less about perfect aim (some of the weapons are kind of random, actually), but on cleverness and reflexes.  More often than not, the game insists on a stealth approach to some fights.  Like DF, JK is more interested in mental puzzles than being yet another Doom.  Every once in awhile, the game takes a break from the FPS mold for one-one-one (sometimes more) Jedi battles.\n\nThe game really shined in Multiplayer, though, back in its heyday.  A thriving mod community (thanks to a simple modification system) expanded on the already great gameplay.  Fighting an AI with a saber and force powers was one thing, playing a deathmatch against fully-powered Jedis was something amazing.\n\nUnfortunately, this release, the Steam version, is not that version of the game.  Single Player is intact, with the exception of the music, which was redbook audio of John Williams' score.  It does leave something lacking to the campaign, as a result.  The Multiplayer system no longer works at all.  While this is not Steam's fault, it is something you should be aware when buying the game.  With the exception of painstaking modification and router configuration, this is now a single player game.  Which is a crying shame.\n\nThe executable for the game is also not always compatible with some patches and mods.  It can be frustrating trying to get the game to work with customizations.\n\nNot all of the differences are bad, though.  The Steam version defaults to a windows GUI for menus, which might seem annoying, but addresses a bug in the original version of the game.  Instead of manually setting the workaround, Steam auto-applies it.  The game contols have been changed to WASD as default, as well.  And while this is not exclusive to Steam's release, this also applies to retail, the game has full native Widescreen support, and always has.  This seems a bit unusual for a 1997 game.\n\nThe two sequels that followed were worthy successors, but this was one of the best titles LucasArts made in their heyday.  It's definitely worth playing if you've never experienced it before.","February 13, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This set of games seems to be completely un-usable "out-of-the-box" on a Win 7 Bootcamp system. I've browsed the forums and there seems to be some sort of convoluted work-around to get them working, but that's not the point. At this point, when I buy a game on Steam, I expect to press the "install" button, and then the "play" button after it has downloaded and that's it. I don't want to waste my time working out some silly re-routing of ports and download this extra file from some random location and whatever else it takes to get the game running. Yes, I only paid $6 for this game, but it should still work when I press play.  Case in point: I went to GoG.com and downloaded the same games and they work fine. That's what I've come to expect from Steam, so it's disappointing to have so many issues with what is now considered a very simple game compared to modern game system requirements. There seems to be no recourse for a refund, nor would it be worth getting a $6 refund, but I'm obligated to at least say someting.","May 2, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"Flat" enemies have been exchanged for 3D polygons, animated cut scenes have been replaced with FMV, the levels are huge, more enemies, more action, etc. However, it is not without its shortcomings.

I thought it unfocused, with bad actors, and that the lightsaber combat really weighed down the core gameplay that I loved so much in the first Dark Forces. But then I thought about it... and thought about it some more, and I only went back on a few things. I do now recommend this game now to casual and Star Wars gamers, but I still think that Jerec and Yun are terribly acted in the live-action cutscenes. Kyle, Jan, and even Boc are actually interesting. The moral system I think is total wank, still. Seriously? I kill one man accidentally, and two seconds later I am evil enough to kill my best friend. And the Dark Side story particularly is a lot more sloppily put together than the Light Side, after the story's big fork in the road. So many times it jumped from one scenario to the next, with no explanation at all. But still, the gameplay is greatly improved, lightsaber combat (while it can be very repetitive. All you do is click) can be rewarding at times. The boss battles are decent. The voice acting's fine.

The game crashed repeatedly and randomly, so you will probably not be able to even beat the first level. Besides crashing, I had a bug where the weapon would just spazz out when I am running, and just go insane when I switched it. It was comical, but it definitely adds to the game being unplayable.\n\nLuckily, there's lots and lots of fixes for the game that will fix the game... In theory! I have been going through the Community forums to try out all sorts of patches and fixes, but to no avail. Many people have gotten it to work, but others weren't as lucky (like me).\n\nThing is, you can get this game on GoG and their version is optimized. I purchased that version too after hearing that it works better than the Steam version, and I was able to beat the first three missions, so I can attest to it working... Mostly. The game crashed once, but it hasn't had any problems since then. The game also runs at fullscreen, though changing the resolution causes the game to crash as well.

It's what led to all the awesome games you youngsters play. :P You think Skyrim is moddable? JK is what started modding communities! Back in my day, we had to "dial-up" on our 56k "modems", and our gaming experience would studdenly COME TO A SCREECHING HALT whenever our parents would pick up the home phone to make a call! And by golly, that's the way we liked it, daggummit!! :-P\n\nOkay, I'm gonna go drink some prune juice, watch the news, and fall asleep in my recliner with my dentures sticking out.

It's hard to believe that this game is almost 20 years old and is still as entertaining now as it was when it was first released.  It doesn't take long to stop noticing the dated quality of the graphics (which were pretty fabulous when the game first came out) and get entirely absorbed in the fun story line and great level design.\n\nI don't know how many times I've played this game from beginning to end, as both light and dark, and it still keeps me interested and entertained.  I bought the discs soon after it first came out, and I was thrilled to see that Steam was offering it when I was away from home and starving to replay this game.  I never encountered the technical issues that some have complained about (running the game on a Windows 7 laptop); some minor tinkering in the in-game set up menu got everything running fine (although no way to make the cutscenes full screen, but not a deal breaker).\n\nIf you have never played this game before, buy it now!

It worked fine on my system but apparently has had many technical issues on others.\n\nStar Wars: Jedi Knight - Dark Forces II is the first FPS game to allow you to wield a lightsaber and use force powers. This was an ambitious project to make a grand adventure and a full jedi experience and that is exactly what you get. Everything has received an upgrade from the original Dark Forces game. "Flat" enemies have been exchanged for 3D polygons, animated cut scenes have been replaced with FMV, the levels are huge, more enemies, more action, etc. However, it is not without its shortcomings.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/recommended/32380/","sharuun","No More Please","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/","204 products in account","Originally, I hated this game. I thought it unfocused, with bad actors, and that the lightsaber combat really weighed down the core gameplay that I loved so much in the first Dark Forces. But then I thought about it... and thought about it some more, and I only went back on a few things. I do now recommend this game now to casual and Star Wars gamers, but I still think that Jerec and Yun are terribly acted in the live-action cutscenes. Kyle, Jan, and even Boc are actually interesting. The moral system I think is total wank, still. Seriously? I kill one man accidentally, and two seconds later I am evil enough to kill my best friend. And the Dark Side story particularly is a lot more sloppily put together than the Light Side, after the story's big fork in the road. So many times it jumped from one scenario to the next, with no explanation at all. But still, the gameplay is greatly improved, lightsaber combat (while it can be very repetitive. All you do is click) can be rewarding at times. The boss battles are decent. The voice acting's fine. I actually do enjoy this game, and I think anyone who plays this will enjoy it as well.","May 15, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Going through the singleplayer story and messing and having a bit of fun with the multiplayer.\n\nWhen I saw the game on Steam, I had to get it. But there's a few problems I ran into.\n\nYou'll notice right away that the main menu is windowed. There is no way to make it full screen. The game itself has the opposite problem; It's full screen all the time with no way to make it windowed. If you want to change a setting while playing the game you'll have to do it through the small window. And it's not really an instant thing to do. The game will black out and you'll have to wait a second to do anything. It can be pretty annoying since it also does the same thing when you're done with the menu can go back to playing the game. You can change your display in-game but this is just for the game itself. And it's not recommended to have your game be something like 1920x1080 since it'll make the HUD really small.\n\nThe game runs just fine without any major problems that I noticed aside from wanting to make some adjustments to the controls. However it's noticable that there's no music. When you're in a bar or something, that has it's own little jingle. But the game has it's own music to play in addition which is absent in the steam version. So for the most part it's silence. You might not mind that though but it's worth mentioning.\n\nThere's lots of secrets to find and the levels each are pretty lengthy. You eventually do become a Jedi with force powers and that's alot of fun to use. There's a lightside and a dark side ending. I think some missions have differences depending on the route you're on but I forget the specific details.\n\nI would have to say that this game is one of my favorite star wars games or FPS games in general. But with the Steam it's bit harder to recommend. I've heard people having plenty of issue with the game that I didn't run into, strangely enough. I'd recommend getting the game physically or via GOG.","December 6, 2011","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game came out when I was just a child and I never actually played this game back then, but I did enjoy countless hours of repeating the demo mission from the old free Mysteries of the Sith demo (MotS is the standalone expac for this game) over and over again, as well as the original Dark Forces. I then began playing Jedi Outcast a few years later, then Jedi Academy. Needless to say, I'm a HUGE fan of the Jedi Knight series as a whole.\n\nThis game has to be one of the most unique shooters out there for the sole reason of force powers and a lightsaber. For the time, this game had beautiful graphics, a remarkable art style that very strongly captured the Star Wars atmosphere, and combine that with the lightsaber/force powers, you take what would be an average 90s shooter and turn it into one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nWhen I purchased this game two Christmas sales ago (with the Star Wars pack), I excitedly hopped onto Steam and installed this game first, and since then I've probably played through it over 50 times. It's not as if there's a lot of choice, as there isn't. Basically, you choose your force powers (and how proficient you are with them) as well as whether or not you kill innocents/droids. No, is is neither the choice nor secrets that keep me coming back to this game. It's purely because this is a GREAT game, even by today's standards.\n\nGraphically, this game is definitely straight from the 90s with FMV cutscenes, blocky polygons, and low-res textures, which leads many people to opt into downloading graphical overhaul mods but I have not once wanted to change the graphics. Sure, they're an eyesore compared to today's games but they still have a nostalgic charm. Plus, as an aspiring developer myself, I am in awe at how they pulled off some of the effects by tapping into their creativity-- something modern devs need to take a look at. My favorite effect is the lightsaber, which uses animated sprites in just the right way to achieve the proper effect.\n\nGameplay-wise, this game runs pretty similar to modern shooters. The number keys select your weapons, you have jump, crouch, run, and activate buttons, you fire using your mouse. The only major difference between this and modern shooters is that there isn't an ironsights feature, nor do you have a separate key for grenades/explosives.\n\nIf you can get past some of the compatibility issues (I can't run in fullscreen on this PC which uses Windows 7), this game is worth every penny if you like Star Wars, shooters, and/or classic 90s games. In fact, the whole Dark Forces/Jedi Knight series is worth a purchase, as they're all great games with great stories and addicting gameplay/level design. I'd say this is my personal favorite in the whole series followed closely by Jedi Academy.\n\n10/10","January 16","true","49.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm pretty shocked to be honest. I love Steam however with a platform of it's size I see no reason why the game has been mistreated the way it has. specially a classic like this. If your going to buy it do yourself a favour and buy the GOG.com version it's DRM-Free and worked for me like a charm without any messing about even at 1080p.\n\nhttps://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_jedi_knight_dark_forces_ii\n\nReview:\n\nThis is one of my all time favourite games which I feel captured the spirit of Star Wars with the continuing adventures of Kyle Katarn. After single handedly stealing the Death Star plans and putting and end to the Dark Trooper program in Star Wars Dark Forces. Kyle now is pitted off against a group of Dark Jedi and must reclaim is Jedi heritage to defeat them one by one, With live action cut scenes although now dated, massive levels and all you can imagine from a First Person Shooter. Multiplayer was awesome on this back in the day aswell!! Dark Forces 2: Jedi Knight has it all. Defintely you should check it out if your a fan of the sequals such as Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast or Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy!","February 3","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You continue from the first game in a story that finally brings in the almighty lightsaber and Jedi. But wait they are killing innocents so they must be sith. No they’re Jedi, but they are “dark” Jedi. I don’t know the difference nor do I care, but I digress. I won’t get into the story, but you basically go around trying to find this droid who takes your stuff and you learn that some of that stuff holds info on the Jedi temples and that you are force prone. You get a kick ♥♥♥ light saber and begin to learn the ways of the force while encountering the “Dark Jedi” along the way.\n\nJust like the first game you get a lot of weapons and that keeps the game relatively fresh and the learning of force powers makes it easy to get to certain places and obtain secrets as well as level progression. Unlike the first game you can actually look up. The game is now a more sophisticated first person shooter. The force powers are fun, but most of the time, or at least in my case, they were nothing more than helping you get from point A to point B. They didn’t assist you in combat all that much. I mean sure I could use force pull and take the enemies guns, or I could just pull out my own gun and shoot them while running in a circle because the AI can’t hit for ♥♥♥♥. Even in the fights with the Dark Jedi I just ran around and swung my saber and in later battles occasionally healed.\n\nThe story was good, the game was action packed, still had the confusing maps and navigation, but overall an enjoyable experience. Even though I went light side on my first play through I know you can go dark and get different powers and maybe even a different ending which means the game has replayability.\n\nOverall I would rate this game an 8/10. Enjoyed the game, story was fine, and mechanics were introduced which made the game that more interesting.\n\nMy Advice, even though I didn’t, before you play this game go look for some mods. The game crashed a lot on me and the texture color could only be fixed by picking up something or hitting the ground with my saber. While this didn’t stop me from play it did get annoying. So before you play this just go online and find some mods to help make this game more of enjoyable experience for you.","February 13","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm gonna go right ahead and start this review off by saying this game is absolutely attrocious looking. I say this within the context of knowing fully well the age of the game, and knowing fully well what games of the time looked like. I stand by this statement because, frankly, the character models and environments in Dark Forces 1 were blurry, but holy crap they looked *so* much better than this. Gunfire graphics look jumpy, your hands cut to different spots when you punch (really, they kind of disappear), NPC's look so blocky and standoutish within the environment, and honestly, even the HUD looks vastly inferior to its predecessor. Add to this the fact that the game crashed immediately when I asked it to save, and the fact that I couldn't get it to go into full-screen mode, and there is just no way I could recommend this to anyone. If you like classic shooters like DOOM, but still want that Star Wars theme, go ahead and pick up Dark Forces 1 instead. (While you're at it, if you like this sort of thing, look into the "Marathon" series by Bungie, you can get free versions online for all three of Halo's predecessors (Search for Marathon Aleph 1 project), and they are next-gen to DOOM and Dark Forces, with classic game feel and space/other world settings.)","January 5","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As it is an older game, it isn't "optimized" when running through steam with the chief complaint being a small window for the FMV sequences and main menu.  However, if you read in the forums, this is due to launching from steam and not the .exe itself.  Since there are no achievements or cards, etc...if you care about running the FMVs fullscreen (the rest of the game works perfectly fine) then launch from the .exe.\n\nAll in all it is a great game to go back to after many years.  I still own box copies of all the Dark Forces/Jedi Knight games but couldn't resist the $5 bundle of all the games on the last Christmas sale.\n\nI still maintain that LucasArts screwed themselves over by not making a full motion picture(s) about the Kyle Katarn saga...it is one of the best.","January 20","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After DOOM, I had yet to find another FPS that caught my attention quite like this one did. That's not to say that Dark Forces was bad, it's just that I didn't adapt to it's odd control scheme as well as I do now a days, so I wasn't able to appreciate it's full glory at the time.\nDark Forces II on the other hand I picked right up on! I loved the ease of controls and the ability to look all around and jump, which contrary to many FPS's of today, was HIGHLY utilized in this title as it did not just have you running around horizontal land scapes, merely scaling a flight of stairs here and there, but it also had you carefully travelling across cat walks, being carried by a stream of water, scaling and decending sky scrapers and other large structures that seem go on forever (as Star Wars structures should), and on and on and on.\nOn top of this you not only get to run and gun and eventually pick up new weapons, but you also acquire force powers as the game goes on, and more than that, you can alter the outcome of the game based upon the the choices that you make within it. And if that's not enough... cut scenes, lots and lots of cut scenes to help push the story and your cuiosity foward as you progress from one unique level to the next.\n\nWhat this lacks though is hi-def textures, the hi-def model pack, and the ability to run this under Wine. Also it may not be clear that you have to reverse the Y Axis in order to un-reverse look, and you also need to set it to use your 3D GFX card else the graphics will look like a gay pride parade.\n\nThat being said, it's worth the download, just don't expect it to be free of configuration needs, and don't expect it to look like a modern game, though map wise, it's got most of the modern ones beet, and the story ain't half bad either, I even read the book!","June 5","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
