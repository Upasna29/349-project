"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fartsaregreat/recommended/448080/","fartsaregreat","MACHINEFEIGN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fartsaregreat/","28 products in account","All of the other review so far for Fibbage aren't in depth, so I though i might do a pros and cons-type review, so you can get the basic idea of Fibbage XL\n\n\n\nPROS:\n+Low system requirements\n+Up to 8 players\n+Local gameplay (one PC required)\n+Simple gameplay\n+Tons of questions\n+Easy to set up\n+Controller support\n+Host (Cookie) will occasionally make some pretty funny jokes\n+Relatively quick rounds (15 minutes tops)\n+Great for people who love trivia\n\nCONS:\n-More expensive than XBOX ONE version, which is only about 7 USD\n-After a while, questions while repeat\n-Requires that every player has a phone/tablet with internet connection\n-Tablet/phone will occasionally connect too slowly, thus causing the player to miss the question\n-Some occasional lag\n\nFibbage XL is a great party game, and is worth getting if everyone has a device to use. If you do own an XBOX ONE, though, get it there unless it's on sale for a lower price here.","April 5","true","5.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","2"

Even parents.\nThe game gets more fun and difficult the more players playing at a time (up to 8)\nThe game also gets more fun the more drunk you and your friends are.\n\n\n11/10 would lie and ♥♥♥♥ myself again.","May 4","true","2.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
