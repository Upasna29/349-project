If you answered yes, then go get it. It's a good buy.\n\nLONG VERSION\nBlazBlue: Calamity Trigger is a 2D fighting game, and the first entry of the BlazBlue franchise followed by Continuum Shift and Chrono Phantasma.\n\nCalamity Trigger features 12 fighters, each with their unique gameplay, strengths and weaknesses.\nAs a fighting game it's important to mention that the game can be played excellent on keyboard without any trouble. The combos are fairly easy, and you will always find new ways to chain them into better ones.\nThe controls are responsive and there's no delay at all. Graphics wise the game looks gorgeous: the 2D sprite models are looking good, and blend well into the 3D background, while animations are smooth and beautiful as well.\nAside from the usual story mode, there is an Arcade mode for every character, mini-games and tons of unlockable artworks to keep you busy for a long time!\n\nHowever like most games, Calamity Trigger has its' flaws too: first off the Developers removed the multiplayer, though it was part of the game for the Games For Windows Live release, and second the game tends to have 30 FPS limit sometimes due to a bug. To fix the 30FPS limit you have to restart your PC, aside from this issue, the game runs smooth with 60FPS cap.\n\nOverall Blazblue: Calamity Trigger is an amazing fighting game. I can highly recommend this to anyone, whether you're new to fighting games or a veteran in the genre.\nAnd as a Guilty Gear/Blazblue fan is a no-brainer to buy, since it increases the chance of seeing more recent games from the developers on Steam!\n\n\nPRO\n- Graphics are beautiful. The 2D sprite models seemlessly blends into the 3D background.\n- Animations looking smooth and nice.\n- Soundtrack is amazing.\n- The game features 2 different language voice acting: Japanese and English. Both are solid.\n- Controls are responsive. The game plays smooth. Combos are easy to pull off. Can be played with keyboard without any difficulties.\n\nCONS\n- Lack of multiplayer.\n- Occational 30 FPS cap bug. To fix the FPS limit you have to restart your PC.\n- Steam cloud doesn't work, though it's shown on store page.","May 22, 2014","true","12.1"," 73 of 80 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","73","80","0","5"

That’s not a problem with the game however. As for how it works, it ran pretty responsively, and the command inputs were near-perfect. (Bang’s Astral is still ♥♥♥♥ing hard to pull off and I haven’t done it yet) Performance-wise in terms of FPS and lag, there was no delay, and any slowdowns the game might’ve experienced were due to the fact that I’m playing it on a crappy two year-old laptop. Otherwise, slowdowns were minimal, and they didn’t make the game unplayable. The Steam port of BBCT isn’t the best PC fighting game I’ve played, (better than how KOF13 ran but not as well as Skullgirls or Guilty Gear Isuka) but for 10 bucks it’s worth a shot if you’re a BlazBlue fan. And the one plus to Steam? If you buy it, you have it for GOOD. So if your computer dies and you need a new one, you can redownload BBCT on it free of charge.\n\nAnd hey, if enough people buy this, that might convince Arksys to bring Continuum Shift and their other fighters to Steam. :D Here’s hoping for Chronophantasma and Persona 4 Arena as well.","February 13, 2014","true","16.3"," 73 of 86 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","73","86","0","0"

'BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger', on the other hand, looks amazing and is probably (one of) the best looking 2-D fighter game out there.\n\nThere are 12 characters to fight with (or against). Not a very big number but at least every character is unique and plays totally different. The gameplay is great, fights get your adrenaline pumping and there are lots of special moves.\n\nThere are a few modes you find in every fighter  like; Arcade, Time Attack and Story mode, so nothing special there. Also, there's no option to play vs friends online, which is something a game like this should have.\n\nThere are also a few things I did find weird, probably because I'm not into anime. Things like; a round is called 'rebel' in this game? and before every match a voice says "the wheel of fate is turning"...\n\nIn my opinion, BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger is a great game but it wouldn't hurt if there was more content. Still, if you don't mind playing story mode or have some friends to play with locally, you can still have lots of fun with this one.\n\n\n\n","May 27, 2015","true","2.7"," 42 of 44 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","42","44","0","0"

That being said, BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger is a huge exception and although I have only really scraped the surface of the game so far, I enjoyed every minute of it! Here are some of my observations:\n\n-The number of characters to select from is relatively small but this is no doubt made up for with the fact that they are all so unique in playstyle and personality. Some of them even use their own energy systems to pull off combos, which really adds depth to the learning curve.\n\n-While learning every characters unique play-style is difficult and time consuming, the basic controls are pretty easy to grasp. The combat seems to be mostly based on momentum and pulling off sick combos that hardly let your opponent hit the floor, but that is not to say that it's impossible to come back from a beating. I wouldn't recommend using a keyboard to play this game. It is much smoother and enjoyable with a gamepad or preferably a joystick setup. I got by just fine using a gamepad.\n\n-There is an overwhelming amount of content as far as the story goes. Every one of the characters has an interesting, somewhat silly, story line with many twists and turns depending on how you play.\n\n-10/10 on the soundtrack, it's pure gold. It compliments the games style perfectly and is one of the best things about this game in my opinion.\n\n-Currently, online multiplayer is non-existent and this definitely hurts the games replayability quite a bit. Thankfully there is a lot to do with the story and offline vs. bots, but I can't help but feel that the game is incomplete without online capabilities.\n\nAll in all, BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger is a great game despite it's lacking of multiplayer. If you are a fan of anime, you're sure to fall in love with it right away!","January 30, 2015","true","5.1"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","38","41","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rayofdope/recommended/263300/","rayofdope","LeGloriousUnderboob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rayofdope/","55 products in account","First of all, Blazblue's one of my favourite fighting games/franchises of all time since I played it on PSP years ago and I've played all kinds of fighting games since Street Fighter EX2 Plus (if I remember correctly) so I would highly recommend it to any fan of the genre. Most negative opinions about the game (from myself n others I guess) are mainly due to knowledge of the better sequels that are not available on PC (yet?) It feels like we're being told to be grateful for having anything at all. Thanks to Arc System Works I can cry myself to sleep...\n\nNote: I would have a lot more hours if my PC didn't currently have problems n bluescreen when I played some games :/ but I played lots before Steam version.\nI type a lot :l Tl;dr (too long; didn't read): read bold text.\nValve: bold text needs to be bolder.\n\nGraphics:\nI put this first 'cause of the game's description of being the first hi-res 2D game, I find this particularly awesome (in all modern 2D fighting games) 'cause these games use pixel art whereby characters and most in-game elements are drawn pixel by pixel and char/sprite animations are done via the same way as GIF images that play according to button input. I'm only assuming this is still how it works today and although I think KOFXIII's pixel art is more godly Blazblue does a great job in keeping the characters alive throughout the battle & making beautiful, fun and non-distracting stages. Animations are smooth and special effects/attacks are pretty. You also get a wide variety of colour palettes when picking a character, more than most other games I've played, just remember to press start when selecting char. The UI/main menu is also very nice & simple.\nP.S. You can skip pretty much all loading screens - just press start - how awesome is that!\n\nGameplay:\nFor those not very familiar with fighting games, one thing to note is the main difference between 3D & 2D fighting games (IMO) is the pacing. Blazblue: Calamity Trigger incorporates this very well for me; it's very fast-paced and requires almost if not constant input and quick response (in a good/hard match). The basic mechanics are very simple. Main input commands are 'weak attack', 'medium attack', 'strong attack' and 'drive' which is a special attack/ability that is unique to each character. Characters don't have a very large skill set but as with many 2D fighting games you can kinda make your own combos as you get used to the mechanics, making efficient use of your 'drive' & your position. There are many levels of difficulty to use to your advantage ranging from "very easy" to "hell mode" so you can go from absolute beginner to master I guess :D and the AI is nothing to laugh at either. Button response has about no delay in this game and attack animations are quick so countering and whatnot are something to look out for (I'm looking at you Hakumen). Each character has about 2 super moves and one 'Astral' move, astral moves are highly animated finishing moves that must be unlocked for most chars and can only be used under certain circumstances, rendering you high with joy when you get to use them.\n\nStory (mode):\nThere is an arcade mode and a story mode, each with different endings for each character. First thing that really gave this game a unique identity to me was the story mode, it plays out like a Visual Novel until you come across trouble and have to fight your way through. The narrative is written very well with no linguistic errors (Engrish) and all dialogue said by any character is fully voiced and it is done absolutely well! You have the option to choose b/w English and Japanese voices and although I would normally go with Japanese, BB's English cast seem so perfectly fit for it and do a great job. Each character has their own story which includes most of the other characters (if not all) and there are at least 2 routes/endings to each story. There is also additional dialogue/extra sequences if you're defeated and sometimes it triggers an alternate route/ending. To reach 100% completion you have to lose & win against each opponent. Tip: Basic sequence is - save game>fight>lose (game over)>load game>fight>win>repeat for 100% story completion. The story itself can be very confusing at first, depending on the order of characters you play in story mode, but overall I love it! Synopsis is available in game description :/\n\nCharacters:\nBB's weakness, as the beginning of a fighting game franchise, is the no. of available chars. There are 12 characters readily available to play with (including the boss/es), each very unique in design and fighting styles. Overall theme is very steampunk. The character relationships are interesting and show in-game during a fight (through dialogue & pre-battle sequences). Later installments of BB add a lot of characters as well as some additions to existing characters' attacks. Overall, I think the characters, their backgrounds and personalities, are more interesting than the main story and they're sorta what make it what it is.\nNote: although later games have a lot more to offer, they kept changing artists for the character cards (what you see in the loading screen before a fight/the VS screen) and I think Calamity Trigger has the best artwork among all Blazblue titles. Noel Vermillion <3 Chronos Phantasma is great too but Continuum Shift's art is the worst IMO, wish we could get BB:CP next :/\n\nMusic:\nIt's Badass! Aside from the main theme, ending credits theme ('Limited again', one of my faves), menu and whatnot, each character has their own fitting theme music and if you set bgm to auto it will play the theme of your opponent (iirc, or the stage, I'm not too sure). The soundtrack is essentially a great mixture of heavy metal & orchestral music and as it is downloaded with the game (in the directory), you can add it to your music library.\n\nExtras:\nThere's a large gallery to unlock which includes concept art, character art, arcade end scenes & a few videos. You can also unlock 'unlimited mode' versions of characters by completing arcade which is a slightly powered up version of the character that you can set when selecting characters for vs battle (not sure about arcade battle). There is also a comedic story-like tutorial about BB's world accessible within story mode called "Teach me miss Litchi".\nBTW, I highly dislike this game's opening, mainly because the one on PSP was far better IMO. The PSP version's opening had the same video (second video up there) but used the arcade music from the first trailer up there on the store page ("Calamity Trigger"), it was so badass and much more fitting than this song (see on youtube)...I used to watch it everytime on PSP but I must skip it on PC.\n\nSpecial element:\nOne of the best things about BB (IMO) is the special element of immersion in the game, characters are lively & have a lot of dialogue within a battle + unique dialogue for certain characters. There are also some special animations before a battle between some characters. This makes it more fun and interesting when you listen to their insults & comments while you fight. This adds tension and/or enjoyment to the already exciting battles. The normal dialogue in a fight also adds so much more, like characters saying "Saw that!" n "Missed!" when you dodge/block/counter. I just love how there's so much effort & personal touches put into this intoductory title.\n\nPeace.","October 18, 2014","true","6.1"," 46 of 57 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","46","57","3","12"

Those crazy Japs just gotta overachieve in everything. They count better, they're better at playing music, and of course they can write a stupidly insane story that's complex as ♥♥♥♥.\n\n\nBut of course, the Japanese are also really weird. I mean, that's just how they are. It's in their culture. Like how each American is born with a gun clutched lovingly in their little baby arms.\n\n\nWhen all of the weird Japanese things come together to become an overwritten fighting game, what do we get? Blazblue.\n\n\nOriginally in arcades, because Japan still has those, and later released on Xbox 360, PS3, PSP, and PC, Blazblue is the weird mix of fast-paced fighting and visual novel. The spiritual successor to Guilty Gear, Blazblue thrives on super complex mechanics and diverse, well-designed characters.\n\n\nThis game's got everything, man. Incest, half-squirrel amine girls in schoolgirl outfits, cats that are actually biological weapons with ♥♥♥♥, cats that are actually cats but they have sex with humans to create magical hybrid people, a milf with big ♥♥♥♥ and a tentacle fetish, a playable blob of tentacles, and a little girl that's actually a million year old vampire so she's actually completely legal.\n\n\nYeah, she's like 7, but go right ahead. She's a vampire, it's okay. She's in elementary school, she's still learning basic math but she sucks blood so shove your ♥♥♥♥ in her. It's all cool, she's actually a million year old vampire. It's alright dude. Your Honor, I'm sorry, I just, I thought she was a vampire. So I'm free to go?\n\n\nAside from being kinda creepy and fetish fuel on a whole lot of levels, Blazblue is a hell of a fighting game. By far one of the best I've played, despite having a smaller roster than most popular fighting games. Fast-paced, easy, and fun to just play. But its mechanics go super in-depth, and you can pull off some sick-♥♥♥ combos if you actually know what you're doing and you're not just mashing buttons randomly.\n\n\nThere's only 12 characters to play as, but each one plays vastly different from the next. They each have their own sort of gimmick, a play-style that fits their personality and sets them apart from the other characters.\n\n\nFor example, Big Sword Main Character is a gruff dickbag, and his weapon drains his health when he goes into super mode, so his play-style is very quick, brute force, and heavy hitting. He recovers health whenever his sword hits, so ideally you'd go into super mode and blitz your enemy with a bunch of heavy sword attacks to keep your health up and their health down.\n\n\nOther characters are similar. Preschool jailbait vampire is kind of an upper-class ♥♥♥♥♥, you know, she brings Lunchables to school. So she doesn't want to get her hands dirty in the sandbox. Her moves are generally ranged, and involve letting loose little minion-type projectiles to whale on you while she just sits there sipping her Caprisun like the ♥♥♥♥♥ she is.\n\n\nIt's almost like, instead of just making a bunch of balanced, basic characters and maybe one with an unfair gimmick, they just gave every character an unfair gimmick. Everyone is overpowered. You can't ♥♥♥♥♥ about people playing one character because he's totally OP and impossible to beat, every character is pretty much that if played competently.\n\n\nI'm a robot with ♥♥♥♥ that can spawn magic swords out of nowhere? You're a blob of tentacles that moves in insane ways, gets crazy airtime, and can get 100+ combos with ease. I can freeze you solid? You're actually two characters being controlled by one. It's all fair, mang.\n\n\nBlazblue just manages to appeal to everything I like in fighting games. The artwork is gorgeous, the soundtrack is super kickass, the spritework and animation is smooth and visually pleasing, and it's just satisfying to watch and play. Combos are fun to execute, and you can finish with some badass super moves.\n\n\nBut there's more to Blazblue than just ♥♥♥♥ and big swords. There's a Story Mode, which plays like a visual novel with some occasional fighting mixed in.\n\n\nReally, just a little fighting. Not too much. Like, maybe a round every couple paragraphs. No big deal, don't worry about getting your reading interrupted.\n\n\nThere's a lot of story. A lot of ♥♥♥♥ing story. Like it's literally a book, it's a ♥♥♥♥ing book inside of a fighting game. It's a good book, don't get me wrong. Very nicely written. Compelling story and characters. But it's a ♥♥♥♥ing book. Each character has their own story to play through, detailing their intricate back-story and where they fit in with the Blazblue mythos.\n\n\nTheir stories are at the very least interactive. You'll be offered a choice now and then. This path or that path. Fight this guy or don't. And choosing different paths will allow you to see more of each character and their story.\n\n\nI personally thought it worked, the writing is excellent and even witty at times. Lots of humor injected in here and there. Sometimes even entire story paths will be humor-oriented. The game takes itself seriously, but not too seriously. It's aware of how stupid it is at times, and it embraces that.\n\n\nSome story paths are actually hidden behind losing matches too, or winning matches with a finisher move. Which is nice, you know, having extra story. Unfortunately, losing matches is required for 100% completion. You'll need to play every story chapter twice at the very least, once to win and once to lose if you intend to get 100% and finish the game. Which is, you know, kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Sometimes the dialogue isn't even anything valuable or interesting, sometimes it's just "oh no I'm dead" and then the Game Over screen. Why the hell does that take up a precious 10% of my 100%? That's ♥♥♥♥ing stupid, dude.\n\n\nIf the story is your thing, there's a whole game worth of story here for you. There's literally a humorous little side story purely for the sake of trying to explain the batshit crazy story in an easier to grasp way. It can be a hassle, but there's so much for you to sink your teeth into. It's the kind of writing where you can tell it's definitely going somewhere, and there's a lot more planned in the mythos to flesh out, so you kind of have to analyze every little tidbit they share to try and figure out what's actually going on.\n\n\nIf the fighting is more your thing, the standard Arcade mode will feature plenty of that, along with the basic structure of a story. So you can kind of figure out what's going on just by playing that also, though not to the same degree.\n\n\nAs far as fighting games go, it's a fantastic story. It's not "an evil organization is having a fighting tournament for like the fifth consecutive time, literally, and they're secretly doing some kind of evil science project at the same time as everyone is fighting". There's much more substance to the plot.\n\n\nFor a fighting game, there's a lot here and yet there isn't at the same time. There aren't 50+ characters with customizable movesets out of the box or anything like that. It's definitely a smaller title. But the amount of effort put into the world of Blazblue is clearly double that of an ordinary fighting game. It's definitely a must-play for any fighting game aficionado at the very least.\n\n\nIts charming cast of characters and overly complex writing and world won me over. I loved every second with Blazblue. It's definitely worth checking out just on its writing alone.\n\n\nAnd if nothing else, hey, if you don't like fighting games or reading, like any amine game there's always some pretty pictures to jack off to in here.","December 30, 2015","true","24.2"," 56 of 76 people (74%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","74","56","76","33","4"

However Just like GG isuka I got burned with a terrible port, no online play, lack of controller support for anything that isn't a 360 controller (it took me several hours of finicky work arounds just so I could use my logitech usb controller)  and a mass amount of confusion on why we got the insanely old version of this series.\n\nDue to GFWL shutting down (which this game was original for) it seems the developer just ported the game over to steam to make some more money off the title and instead of adding in a new netcode for online play they just stripped the feature completly. It is unknown at this time if purchasing this game will have any impact on whether or not future titles will come to pc and steam. One can hope But I will not being holding my breath.\n\nFor 10 dollars you will get however a great story mode with fun loveable characters and the ability to play around with imo one of the best fighting systems out there. The game is fantastic and if it had some form of online play I would start gifting copies of this game, to my far away friends that is how much fun it is. You also get the soundtrack which is fantastic on its own and for the price it might even be worth it to you.\n\nI will recommend this game as for me I would have probably still purchased it knowning it didn't have online play attached, however for many of you this will be a deal breaker, and I would not recommend this game to you.","February 15, 2014","true","2.0"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","1"

This may be an outdated game, gameplay-wise (multiple new editions have come out since this one, with new characters, balance changes and continued story and such), but I think it's still worth getting the first game for the sake of the story mode. The story mode of this series is actually quite rich and detailed with a very thought out lore and world (rare for this genre) with very lovable and charming characters and funny situations, and in a gorgeous visual novel style. Other than that, there is arcade mode and versus with a very expansive gallery mode to collect for.\n\nMy favorite thing about BlazBlue other than the story mode is how unique each fighter plays. They are totally distinct from each other, and in more ways than your usual fighting game because of their Drives. Drives are a special ability each character has unique to them. For instance, one character's drive attacks steal a little bit of HP with each hit, and another's freezes them, and another controls a puppet, or pulls you in with magnetism, or summons flying swords out of thin air. Just awesome stuff, and it makes the characters so much fun to play as. This is a 4-button fighting game, with weak (A), medium (B), heavy (C) and drive (D) attacks. And last but not least, the taunt button! It's a really sophisticated combat system, and it's just outstanding. Also, the graphics and music and overall presentation of the game are just absolutely beautiful.\n\nFor $10, this is certainly worth the price, especially when that includes the amazing soundtrack. Hopefully this means the sequels get on Steam eventually too, as well as more from Arc System Works in general.\n\nUnofortunately, this version of the game doesn't include online multiplayer, since it was sacrificed in order to get it here without Games for Windows Live. For me, that's a worthy trade-off, but for others it might not be. This is a fantastic game and I am so glad it has finally made it to Steam, but buyer beware.\n\nAlso, it is blue.","February 14, 2014","true","112.1"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","25","29","0","4"

I'm a fairly casual fighting game player and mostly play Street Fighter, but I found BlazBlue easy to get into, and I love how uniquely each character plays. Ragna feels like a pretty standard melee character and is a good way to get used to how to the game works, but then you also get characters like Nu, who doesn't play like anything I've ever seen before, with a focus on ranged attacks without the use of complex inputs. The cast is a little smaller than I'd like, but this is unavoidable due to the age of the game; unfortunately we have yet to see any PC ports past the first game.\n\nThe art and sound design are also top-notch, just as they were in Guilty Gear, though this game is considerably more modern and much prettier graphically than the even more aged Guilty Gear titles available on PC. Game runs well too, with a pretty steady 60 FPS even on my fairly weak machine. There's no online multiplayer, but for someone like me who tends to get walked all over online in fighting games by the people who play the game more seriously, that's fine by me. In addition to the arcade mode, which does have little clips of story here and there, there's also a full-fledged story mode that plays out like a visual novel and adds some content to help keep things from getting stale.\n\nOverall BlazBlue is probably going to be my go-to fighting game going forward. It's not perfect, but I've been enjoying my time with it immensely (especially Noel's combos, my God). The only thing this game is missing as far as I'm concerned is BANG BANG BANG BANG BA-BANG! If that song played every Bang fight, no, every fight, no, at all times, I would be a happy man.\n\nEDIT: So I just realized that one of Bang's specials does actually change the battle music to that song for the rest of the match. Good enough. And here I was worried it wasn't in the game because it wasn't in the soundtrack files included alongside it.","October 27, 2014","true","12.3"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","21","29","0","1"

Intuitive but deep is the only way I can describe the combat, and the small but diverse roster and good backstory helps a lot as well.\n\nCore Gameplay:\n\nPretty solid, with moves that fluidly turn into combos; I'm playing with just a keyboard, which is probably not the recommended setup, but I'm still doing fine. The simplicity of the game is really helpful; no enviroments to get in your way, just two combantants duking it out. The seperation of the "drive" - one of the most often used abilities - into a seperate key is the cornerstone of the easy to learn, hard to master fighting system in the game.\n\n\nCharacter Roster\n\nTwelve is a pretty small roster for a fighting game, but a fantastic point is the game's favour is that there are no clones; each character fights in a totally different style befitting their personality and powers. My favourite, Jin, keeps his opponents at a short distance using ice projectiles before freezing them and moving in for the attack. Carl, on the other hand, uses his robot sister as both a shield and a catspaw to catch an opponent off guard. You're sure to find the one right for you!\n\nAesthetics/Graphics\n\nThe designs in this game are some gorgeous 2D stuff, no mistake, but if you have an aversion to anime and anime-like designs for backgrounds and characters this game will turn you off; it subscribes to many, many anime conventions. However, the bold stylistic choice results in a very diverse group of character designs; they look distinct, in both clear and subtle ways. For example, Taokaka,  Iron Tager and Arakune look totally different, coming from various backgrounds. On the other hand, Noel and Jin wear similar uniforms (both belonging to a military called the NOL) but are easily told apart on the battlefield due to minor but well placed differences in how they wear it, no mean feat.\n\nStory and Story Mode\n\nAs with the designs, the story is very anime-ish; it is presented piece-meal, but after playing through several different perspectives (which, incidentally, is a good way to become familiar with the roster) you start to get a handle on it. Really, the powderkeg personalities of the roster are the key here. I found myself liking even characters like Taokaka and Bang, who I initially thought ridiculous, because their individual stories are told with humour and pathos. Of course, not everyone is guarenteed to be likable (I can not bring myself to bear Noel and her constant whining) but odds are you'll find a horse to back in this very confusing and at times incomprehensible plot.\n\n\nThe best thing is how gameplay and story co-incide! Characters will offer voice clips when they fight each other relating to the situation and how they view the other person; this is amazing for building atmosphere. It can range from simply recognising the opponent as an agent of a rival faction like Sector Seven or the NOL, to calling them a pet name, to swearing at them or giggling psychotically at their pain.\n\nThe bosses (by which I mean the two "hidden characters", who you will likely face on your first runthrough of any story) can be very difficult, especially if you're using someone you're not familiar with. However, they never feel impossible or super-cheap.\n\nConclusion\n\nI've still got a lot to do on this game, and I hope they add acheivements and maybe even steam-supported netplay, but for its low price tag and taking into account single player and local multiplayer, I encourage you to give it a shot, especially if you're interested into starting out in fighting games!\n\nThe Wheels of Fate are Turning...","January 2, 2015","true","24.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

The game itself is a nice fun 2D fighter game from Arc System Works, creator of other 2D fighters like the Guilty Gear series and other games.\n\nAnyway good points: theres not a whole lot to be onnest, fights are fun and if you feel the need for a challange theres the score attack where the difficulty is cranked up to the max, and even the story mode has its fun moments from time to time.\n\nNow the bad points: if you was hoping for some good online fights well sadly this game doesn't have it, in the old ps3/Xbox version there was a online section so why its not here i do not know, so you are limited to having a friend round to play with you. Also not super relavent but the story mode has multiple paths in the game for each person that people might find annoying, such paths like multiple choice, ending a fight with a super or astral finish, or even just dying to the enemy itself.\n\nOverall, its still a fun game to play if you like 2D fighters or like the old nostalgic fighting of BlazBlue, but as most people will put it, Its missing out the online part of the game.

Surprise as this is coming from someone who didn't really enjoy or have any interest in the genre outside of Super Smash Brothers (if you even want to count that, I consider it more of a beat-em-up) and a couple oddball games like Soul Caliber and Virtua Fighter 5 as well as even a Street Fighter game, none really caught my attention until I bought this on a whim. Just like with Skyrim, I wanted to give it another chance, maybe I'd find something enjoyable here that I didn't with the other games and did I ever.\n\nThe first thing that I loved most about this game was the art style, the main reason why it was high on my list. That annnd it was on sale...heh. After playing a bit of the Arcade and Story, I immediately fell in love with the game and all it's characters who really shine in their own unique way. Each one plays vastly different from the other, though there are a couple who play kind of similarly. BlazBlue is a game worth picking up if you're are wanting some gameplay with some excitement, a low-ish skill floor but a very, very high skill ceiling compared to some other titles.\n\nWhile playing through, you notice you have all your attacks plus a special? Yes, this ability, called the Drive, allows your character to do neat attacks such as regain health, control a puppet or chain some gunplay. Along with the amazing roster of characters you can play, there's also a mode to go through each of their tales to figure out the overaching story (as of me writing this, I have not finished it, but am about ~70% the way through).  I believe that this is where the game shines brightest alongside the amazing characters. As you go through, they become memorable because of their personality as well as movesets. I'm really loving the story, though it might not be for everyone as it makes you try to put together all the pieces which may seem more of a chore than fun.\n\nThere's also a vast gallery where you can unlock art and movies, all of which are really well-designed. Again, I really love the art and aesthetics of this game, the music is alright, nothing too special although some are relaxing yet give a nice tone when you do listen. Surely there's nothing wrong with such an amazing title. Well, there is and probably the greatest downfall, a lack of an online multiplayer and a tutorial. You're pretty much left to either play single player or get a friend with another controller/keyboard. From what I've read around, it's because it is a port from the original XBox launch. Still, it's a nice game worth the time I've put into it. I highly recommend using an Xbox controller or an arcade stick if you want to play.\n\nYou probably noticed I said high skill ceiling. That's the greatest thing I've found out about this game, a lot of the characters you can pretty much mash buttons and still do damage. However, with practice you can do some pretty amazing things. I'm pretty sure that this goes for a lot of fighters, though I think it's a lot more noticeable in here. If you're looking for a nice entry into fighting games, I highly suggest giving this a try, the replayability, while little, is really worth it for those who are looking for something nicely competitve.","December 1, 2015","true","24.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Most games in this style just demand that the player keep pressing buttons to win, or keep spaming the same movements over and over again. This is not the case here. The learning curve of Calamity Trigger is not easy, but it's certainly rewarding.\nYou have 12 characters to play from, and to some, this may be a small amount to play with. But the thing here is that you don't have two characters who have a similar style. Everyone has different fighting mechanics, and certainly, one of them will become your favorite:\nYou have Ragna the Bloodedge, who fights with both his giant sword, and using his fists and kicks, and is able to drain life from his opponent when he uses his Azure Grimmoire. There is Jin Kisaragi, who have a sword similar to a katana, and has ice powers. There is Noel Vermillion, who uses two giant pistols. There is Rachel Alucard, who is similar to a lady doll from the noble parts of society, who uses his shapeshifting cat and his sidekick to move graceously in the battlefield. Use her special movement (Those are called Distortion Drive in this game) early in the battle, and you will probably miss, but try to spread Lighting Rods and then using the Distortion, and all of them will get energized by the movement. Some of the characters even use their Heat Gauge (Used to make Distortion Drives) differently from other characters, and this variety of gameplay is one of the things that makes this franchise killer, not mentioning all the counter movements, throws, defensive maneuvers and ways to even use your Heat Gauge to extend combos.\nThe story is another major point of this game. You have 10 character's story mode to complete. Two of them are not included. In each campaign, you have different routes in the story based on some dialog choices, and even losing specific battles will not result in Game Over, rather opening another path to go on. Even the way you finish your battles may alter the route. Every character's story mode has a percentage of completion, and to get 100%, you will need to see every possible outcome. This way, you will be able to reach the true ending of that character's campaign...but does that mean the other ones are alternative endings? Check to story and draw your own conclusions.\nIn Calamity Trigger, you basically have the Story, Versus, Score Attack and Arcade modes. In the Arcade, you will choose one character to defeat 10 others, and in specific encounters, you will even have a dialog. It's a simple game mode, but not short of surprises. Some interesting rewards await those who complete it.\nThe game is completely dubbed, both in japanese and english, and has subtitles as well. I didn't play in English, but the Japanese one is awesome, as expected.\nThe only let-down is that it has no online mode, but trust me, you will spend dozens of hours in this game if you want to take the most of it.\nFinally, it has one of the most amazing soundtracks I've ever heard. It's a mix of classical music and heavy metal, and if you're into that style of music, you will be delighted. Best of all, you will get the full digital OST in MP3 buying this.\nThat said, Blazblue: Calamity Trigger is recommended both to the ones who enjoy an awesome fighting game, and to those you're just getting started in that genre. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.\n\nPS - INFERUNÔ DIVAIDAHHHH!\n","December 17, 2014","true","33.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

They include some key features, such as a good amount of Resolution options, Anti Aliasing, Bloom and sound options. Its a sprite based fighting game, so there isnt really that much to change when it comes to the visual options.\n\nThe framerate is quite off though. My PC is not exactly top tier, but its definetly not low tier either. Mid tier, ive gotten drops to 45FPS which is really bad in a fighting game. Other than that, the game usually runs at a solid 60FPS.\n\nThe game also doesnt handle Alt+Tabbing out of the game that well, as ive seen the sprites bugging out by doing so. This can range from completely dissapearing  or the colours being completely off.\n\nThere is no online, though i personally dont feel this matters. Calamity Trigger is an old game, and the balance is VERY off. Multiple characters has 1 hit kill combos/setups, so going online you probably wouldnt be having that much of a good time.\nThe game does allow for Local 1v1, so if you want to play with friends, there is that option.\n\nThe Story is good. Its done in a Visual Novel style, and should take about 10-20 hours to go through, depending on how much of a completionist you are.\nIt does have "Supposed to lose" fights, so in a few fights you actually fail when you win. The game also has some fights which require a "Distortion Finish" which is basically requires you to win with a Super move. Both of these got changed in the later installments of the series, except for a select few matches where distortion/Astral finish was required.\n\nId say, if you buy this game, dont buy it for a Fighting Game solely. Buy it if you are interrested in the story of Blazblue and possibly want to see the rest of the games ported to PC. As a fan of the series, id say its worth it. You also get the soundtrack which is amazing. Its a mix between Instrumental Rock and Vocal remixed versions of the instrumental songs(Lyrics are in Japanese).","February 15, 2014","true","10.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

When this first came to PC it was an instant buy for me. So let me tell you some things about the PC version. First off they redid the textures to Hi-Res Textures. Not super noticeable but still nice. This game has really unique fighting styles and big things that make characters different from echother. The story mode is pretty long with each character having their own story. The backrounds in this game are gorgeous with so many little details and hard work put into these levels. Arcade Mode is a mode where you select a character and fight through 10 random fighters until you reach the final fight. Something very common in most fighting games. There is one downside though to this game. Sadly there is no online so if you're one of those people that like competitive online against other people like me then that's a big turnoff from getting this game to many people including like me so be weary of that. The console version included online but I can see the reasons for why they might not have included it. I bought it to support Arc System Works (The Developers) and hoping they might do more BlazBlue PC ports in the future. But also because this is still a great game without online being in it. Also I couldn't get my fightstick to work so I don't know if it supports fightsticks but overall this is a great game and definitely worth it for the low price its at. If you like fighters you should definitely try it out.","February 25, 2014","true","6.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The 2 player local  co-op can be a bit clustered at times if your using a keyboard, but if you have two controllers then the game is easier for  both players to enjoy. The best part of the games combat system is that it has a varity of ways for to make combo's to combine with special unique cinematic moves that gives you a good feeling after performing it in the game. The story line of the game is divided into 14 parts each with one of the games playable characters, combined overall the storyline takes about a good 5 hours to finish all together. Lastly there is arcade mode the last playable part of the game where you wanna focus on, but first let me say that the arcade mode of the game is EXCATLY the same as arcade port of the game you see in large arcades or in japan in general. The main thing that beating arcade mode with do for you is unlock a astral heat unique to each character in the game with some exceptions like Ragna which is unlocked by default. So yeah the game is lengthy enough to enjoy when you have nothing else to do but I will say the game is easily forgotten when the newer fighter games come out and take its place and sooner or later there will be no point to come back unless you wanna play story mode to understand the story background of this game to latest game in its series.","January 19, 2015","true","7.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I'm going to admit now that I am a bit embarrassed for having gotten confused when I first picked up the sequel on my Xbox without having played the original, which led to a great deal of confusion.\n\nAnyways, onto the actual review: the game plays fantastically although I seem to have some issues trying to pull off half-circle back, forward moves (Or 63214-6 attacks for you fighting game buffs) which isn't much of an issue when I am playing on my Xbox, however it has severly limited my combos and playstyle for this game since I would usually start off with a basic combo and finish off with a distortion (The equalivent of a super combo/edge attack/what have you) or vice-versa.\n\nThe story of Calamity Trigger is a bit tough to grasp at first as you'll need to play through each individual character's stories to figure just what the hell is going on in the game's universe. In short, the story is about a world that has begun building cities atop giant pillars called Hierarchical cities as the surface of the planet is covered in a thick smog of poo gas which will mutate you or kill you flat out. An oppressive police force known as the Novus Orbis Librarium (aka the N.O.L. or the Library) has taken control over the world using Ar Magus (Just think magic) and has been secretly building super weapons that look like young girls (Its Japanese, did you expect something else?) called "Prime Field Devices" our hero, a criminal called "Ragna the Bloodedge" ventures to the Hierachical city of Kagutsuchi to destroy the 13th Prime Field Device, however he has a huge bounty on his head and must fight several colourful enemies to continue his quest. AND THATS ONLY ONE STORY.\n\nThe characters are fairly balanced (Except Hakumen, that counter spamming, stun locking cheap S.O.B) and all have very unique styles that require lots of patience and timing to use correctly. I personally like the cast as they all have great personalities, stories, motives, and theres one character who is essentially a mentally stunted cat lady who is just too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ adorable for her own good. Plus the characters who have interactions in the story/arcade mode will have unique dialogue before, during and after a fight which really helps to give the player a strong understanding of just who the character are in their own world.\n\nPersonally, I think the sequel is much better (I main Hazama, and he is absent from CT) as it adds more characters, a larger story, more levels, and a few additional game modes (Depends on which version you are playing, original had Legion, Extend has Abyss). That being said, I am not saying that CT is a bad game at all, in fact I have praised it quite a bit to friends and I look forward to playing both Continuum Shift and Chronophantasma on Steam in the near future. If you are a fighting buff like myself, then you owe it to yourself to play the Blazblue series, but be warned that you may have to take a few visits to the wiki to figure out just what everything is in the game (Or watch the slightly amusing "Teach me Ms. Litchi!" series in the game).","February 14, 2014","true","4.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Never played the actual game until now, but I had Bang, Tager, Rachel, Noel, and Ragna for MUGEN, so I was curious to see where they were from. How is the game? Surprisingly good for a 2D 1v1 fighter. I never got into games like Mortal Combat and Street Fighter because they didn't seem very interesting. You didn't know much about the characters, they all looked the same, and they just seemed like something you would just play at a friends house.(note that not all of these statements are neccessarily true, because I never did play them) BlazBlue, however, focuses on only twelve characters, which is small for a fighting game roster in this day and age. Because of this, they all look different, all use different tactics, and all play differently, with a few extreme examples. You've got Ragna, the all-rounder and face of the game, a man who wears a trenchcoat-shaped cliche and wields a big sword, Noel, who uses dual pistols which behave unlike most pistols I've seen, V-13, which is somehow pronounced 'Nu', who animates eight floating blades for attack and defense, and Taokaka, a cat-person with massive claws and some truly impressive speed. These all use the same controls and are usable by pretty much everyone to good effect. But then you've got Akumen and Rachel, who play completely differently. Add to this variety a story mode for each character, and you've got something I didn't expect from this genre. Other than the story mode, there's a versus mode, training mode, Arcade mode, Score attack, and that's it.\nThe art design is consistently interesting, and all the stages are distinct from each other. Music is pretty good, but nothing standout. Gameplay wise, it's pretty balanced. A few characters have really powerful attacks that are balanced by their completely different playstyles, which lends the characters variety without making some of them overpowered.\nOverall, it's a fun game, and it's only ten bucks. I recommend it.","February 14, 2014","true","23.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I've spent more hours on BBCT than I have in Skullgirls & that's approaching 1000 before too long...\n\nHowever, it must be noted this is the very first Blazblue (BB) game and there've been 2 full versions after. Currently, Blazblue Chhrono Phantasma is the game to play & there's been a campaign to get it on steam. After a week of the campaign, Blazblue CT (this game) magically appeared on steam. No advertising...no real announcements or nothing. So that has to mean something. Mind you, the game was already ported to PC a while ago, but it was 1-2 years after the original and the 2nd game had already come out, making it obsolete & furthermore, really effed up because of "Games for Windows Live" DRM.\n\nIn this new steam revision, they removed GFWL (THANK GOD), but at the time of this review, there's no netplay. You DO get all the DLC color palettes which are actually very cool, and the game runs VERY VERY SMOOTH at 60fps. Anyways, it might be good to get so you can familiarize yourself with the game and how the main characters work. And if nothing else, buy it to further the campaign to get more arc system works games on steam.","February 15, 2014","true","0.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I knew very well Calamity Trigger had a PC release and I do believe that the sequel Continuum Shift also had a PC release. The only one that I believe didn't was Continuum Shift Extend and Chrono Phantasma definitely did not have a PC release. What can I say? Blazblue is a superb fighting game. It has a vast amount of content in it for both offline and online. You have story where you play through each character with branch paths leading to a good ending/true ending or even a silly/parody ending. Then you got arcade that also has its own branch story that somewhat sums the story in a nutshell (sort of). Sure its sequels add a few new characters to play as but its story continues and it gets even more interesting. Blazblue probably is the most in-depth fighting game out there with an in-depth story. I had to even look up the wiki to fully understand it. The character personaliteis are all unqiue. You have basicaly every sort of anime-stereotype there. The hard-boiled load mouth protagonist, the cold, (sometimes) sadisitic brother who is also a protagonist. You got a klutzy girl who is not fully modiviate. A cat-mutant girl who is known to be part of the Kaka clan who loves "meat buns" from "boobies lady". And so much more. I have hopes they will release more of its sequels upon this one. I recommend it. They have keyboard controls and a controller input as well. The keyboards are not really difficult to master honestly. I highly recommend this game.

Then it’s time to throw down with BlazBlue:Calamity Trigger, the oldest version of the over-the-top heavy metal fighting franchise from Arc System Works. BlazBlue’s combat system encourages you to play as offensively as possible with a plethora of aggressive tools, so the action rarely slows. Characters can dash, air dash, high jump, double jump, jump cancel, and defensive roll, all in the name of getting close and dishing out punishment. Once you start to get a feel for the controls and BlazBlue’s mechanics, you find yourself thrust into frantic fights which push you to constantly keep up the pressure while simultaneously staving off your opponent’s blistering assault - an exhilarating combination.","March 14, 2014","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZenTori/recommended/263300/","ZenTori","ZenTori","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZenTori/","236 products in account","While I've been a fan of this series ever since my friend told me about it a couple years ago, I never actually played any of the games due to not having a PS3 or an Xbox 360. I know that this game was on PC over in the UK and on GFWL and such, but I never bothered to get that since I didn't feel like it was worth it, not to mention the price. So when I saw this on steam, I jumped at the chance. I DID take a look at the steam information on this game and I still bought it. So let's get on with the good and the bad.\n\nPros:\n- Graphics. I really like the sprites and detailed backgrounds in the stages. I'm not the sort of guy who thinks games are only as good as their graphics. Not at all. But the game's graphics is a plus for me.\n- Awesome music. I think everyone already knows that pretty much every game has at least some good music. Fighting games generally have awesome music. You get the OST when you buy this game and it's so worth it.\n- Length. I've played 9.6 hours as of this review, and I'm not even halfway done with the story. The story has branching paths depending on whether you win, lose, win with a distortion/astral heat, or choose different options in the story when the choice arises (There's a guide in the community hub to help you get 100% on all character's stories). There's only three characters that have an astral heat when you first start the game. To get the others, you have to beat arcade mode with the character you want the astral heat for. You can also unlock Unlimited mode for characters, which just makes them more powerful, by having more speed, power, modified distortions, etc. That also adds a bit more to the length. Beside that, there's also score attack to do and the gallery to complete if you wanted to do those things.\n- Price. You get all of this for $10. I think I got like at least $20 worth from playing some of the character's stories and listening to the OST alone.\n\nCons:\n-No online play. For me, I don't really care too much that this game doesn't have online versus. I know that fighting games are really all about playing against someone else and most places don't have a local fighting scene. However I will say that online play is never recommended for top play. It's fine for beginner-intermediate play, but there's always some sort of latency that to play extremely competitively online in a fighting game is sort of absurd. But while I don't care too much that it's offline only, I still would've liked to see it have online. H2 Interactive might be able to implement it in the future.\n- Bugs. This is a straight port of the GFWL version, so all the bugs on there are also on here. Sometimes your game will be locked at 30 FPS if your computer's been on for a while. This can easily be fixed with a restart. When I first started the game, the FPS was actually locked at around 17 FPS, but again restarting my computer fixed that. There's also a bug for some people where story mode does not have music at all. If you alt+tab out of the window and come back in, sometimes the characters' sprites will be invisible or have weird hitbox colors. These can usually be fixed if you alt+tab again or have the sprites change (either by hitting, getting hit, or anything else that changes the sprites). Same thing happens in story mode's cutscenes. Alt+tabbing will usually make the character completely invisible, or partly invisible, and the only way for that to be fixed is if the character moves somehow due to an event in the story. But it'll only happen for that one scene you alt+tabbed out of. It may also crash on certain parts, I've read about how some people are crashing after clearing score attack but I haven't played that mode yet.\n- Controller support. Despite it saying Full controller support, it only fully supports Xbox controllers and anything using Xbox. My PS2 controller doesn't work, but my Madcatz TE Xbox 360 stick does work. For any other controllers, you'll have to find a way to emulate the Xbox 360 controller or maybe use one of those controller mapping programs. I have no experience with those so I'm just glad I got an Xbox 360 stick instead of a PS3 one (Though I would very much like to have one still).\n-Not entirely beginner-friendly. There's absolutely no tutorial on what you can do. There is a manual if you right click the game and read it (but who really does that? I didn't even know about it until I right clicked it once). So you'll have to either go into training mode and test out your things or read a guide or something. Basically each character has a light attack, medium attack, and heavy attack, recognized as A, B, and C respectively. Each character also has a Drive attack, recognized as D. Every single attack also has a forward+ action, so if you hold forward and press A, B, C, or D, you'll do a different attack than just pressing A, B, C, or D by itself. Same thing for in the air, though I believe it depends on certain characters. Arakune, for example, has a down+A/B/C attack in the air. Pressing A+B at the same time gives you a barrier block, which is different from a normal block, obviously. There's also an instant block and instant barrier block, if you block about 8 frames before an attack connects. B+C is your grab attack. A+B+C consumes 50 heat, and allows you to cancel a move. A+B+C+D is your burst, which lets you get out of a combo. Not recommended to use early in the round, since you won't have a barrier gauge and will be in Danger status until the round ends. However, definitely recommended if you're supposed to lose in story mode to get a certain scene or path.\n\nOverall, I would still recommend this game. If you have never played a BlazBlue game but wanted to, I'd say go for it. If you want to experience the story, go for it. If you want to get familiar with BlazBlue games, go for it (Although each new game changes something). Despite the cons, I still really enjoyed the game and will enjoy it for many more hours to come. The story and OST alone are worth the $10, I'd say.","March 1, 2014","true","20.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The visuals are nice, the controls are intuitive, and the extensive story mode makes for some entertaining reading. All of the fundamentals are in place. Nonetheless, Arcsys pushed this game out during a time when they legally couldn't make Guilty Gear games, and as a result, everything about this game smacks of a poor man's Guilty Gear. Anyone saying it isn't fair to compare the two series is delusional. Both games are the exact same flavor of fighter, but BlazBlue performs just a step below its sibling series in most regards. Every character on the roster is some transparent Bizarro World counterpart of someone from Guilty Gear. The music is the same metal style, but the melodies aren't as catchy aside from tunes that too closely resemble Guilty Gear pieces. The story is entertaining, but not as interesting. And the lack of online multiplayer in a PC port is a fault too glaring to omit. The overall gameplay, however, does manage to be on par with Arcsys's flagship fighter. Don't confuse my intentions; BlazBlue: CT is a good game in its own right. This brings me to my point: The developers didn't need to borrow so much from Guilty Gear. If you like the developer's other fighting offerings, you'll like this one, because it's almost the exact same thing. Arcsys would have done better to capitalize on the opportunity to create a more unique series, but instead, they came out with BlazBlue: Totally Not Guilty Gear, Sega.","April 5, 2014","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Didn't care, and I bought it.\n\nMoney was worth it.\n\nInterface/Menu: 5/5 - The menu was original and was layed out very well. There's not much more than I can say about it, because the menu is pretty self explanatory, you've got your training button, arcade, story, exit button, score attack, and gallery. The music is very well made, thanks to Daisuke Ishiwatari. The circle layout in the select character screen fits the way the game works. I like the part where the random select is in the middle, which wasn't that self explanatory, I had to figure that out.\n\nGameplay: 4/5 - The gameplay is fluid and pretty simple, yet hard in some ways. You've got your weak, medium, hard, and drive attacks (A,B,C, and D), just like Injustice. Combo stringing is very open, as practically anything goes (An A,B,C will work for most characters). The mechanics are kind of hard to learn, such as the air recovery, ground recovery, barrier break, throw escapes, negative warning, and the barrier bar underneath each character's health. However, every character, except for Tager, has a double jump and air dash. This is one major part in the game, just like ground hits. There's also distortion drives and astral heats or finishes. These are moves that take 50%-100% of your heat bar. They perform stronger attacks, and your astral heat, always taking 100, will do a finisher, which is a nice touch to the game, adding some variety to the characters. For instance, with one character, you slice them with a scythe and then stab them with a sword, or on another character, you put them in an ice cage. Some characters have special distortion drives, like pushing you and your opponent, or even causing firey attacks, allowing you to go into a more powerful mode.\n\nStory: 5/5 - The story is solid. However, in some cases, it doesn't all make sense. The stories intertwine with each others quite nicely, and even I haven't finished all of it. The cutscenes are nice, however not very fulfilling. The dialogue is very funny. Also allowing customization for the textbox is really neat.\n\nSoundtrack/Music: 5/5 - The music is amazing, and gives BlazBlue the feeling that it needs. It's also included in the BlazBlue folder, allowing me to listen to it in the best quality.\n\nSprites/Animation: 3/5 - The sprites are good, and every detail is included into them, however the animation isn't all that fluid. However, it's probably the best you can get from a 2D game. However, some animations are fluid, like Rachel ducking and sitting on her cat. Don't complain people, it's the way it works.\n\nMisc: 3/5 - To be honest, multiplayer isn't a BIG thing to me. However, it should be in some fighting games. GWFL's port of BBCT to Steam took out the multiplayer, so it's a singleplayer game, but there's still some hope that this will be added. There's some other bugs that I've heard about, like FPS locking at 30, or sprites disappearing, but it's fixable, so I wouldn't really mind.\n\nOVERALL: 9.7/10 - This is a recommended game. You should get it. Or you can wait for a sale, because that's what I did.","May 18, 2014","true","45.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

This port is much better than the original Windows PC port. It runs very nicely and no crashing but requires a somewhat powerful PC to run 60 frames.   However, It lacks a few things that would make the game more enjoyable that the original PC port originally has. The steam version sadly lacks netplay which is a huge bummer especially to those who enjoy playing against actual people (Which is 85% of the Fighting game community). There is no challenge mode which would be nice to those just starting out. If you love Arc System Works' Guilty Gear series and fighting games in general or just curious about how BlazBlue plays, It's a really nice port of the 2D fighter despite it's lack of features. If you are a huge fighting game fan with 10$ to spend, Go for it! If you are just a casual player and curious about the game, You may want to wait for the game to go on sale in the future if it ever does as it lacks play value if you don't play fighting games competitively.

One that I did even lets you skip most battles completely depending on the options you choose.\n\nFrom what I saw, there is very few negatives to this game, except for the fact that the combos for some characters can be a little confusing... (I could never get the ones that required the full-rotation of the analog stick to work.)  However, I'm pretty sure you could very well do every combo in the game if you had the right controller and such.\n\nAnother negative (and I'm not sure about this one because I was never able to do this myself) is the "unlimited" mode you get on characters after you beat Arcade Mode with them.  Let's say you dont have it on anyone and the person you are playing against has it on everyone, on online battle.  If they choose to use it, the fight will be completely one-sided, and you are almost sure to lose. (Especially if they use the dual-pistol chick, i can't remember her name right now.)\n\nOther than that, with beautiful scenery, deep story, with different branches you can do, and overall interesting characters, I would have to give this game a good two thumbs up.\n\nMy personal ratings:\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nSound: 8/10\nStory: 9/10\nGameplay: 7/10 (controls being a factor here)\n\nOverall (averaged) rating: 8.25/10","August 14, 2014","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A fighting game.\nThe gameplay is nice - it's really my cup of tea when fight can be entertaining even for newbies - special combos are easy to perform (mostly), the most specials are cool looking. At the same time, the difficulty can be varied from "casually easy" to "I broke my gamepad", which is pleasant to have.\nThe story of this fighting game is amazing. Really, the story and characters aren't something you usually expect from a fighting game - from any game, actually. I was charmed by the universe of the game.\nIn addition, game's soundtrack is beautiful. It's themed for every character and some special fights and, actually, nicely fit them. Now I'm using it in my playlist.\n\nUnfortunately, you need a real friend to play with - there's no internet play (curse GFWL!).\n\nWell, that's my positive comment. I am also wathced the anime, based ON this game, so... yeah, I'm a great fan of this game.\nWant other games of the seria to be ported.

I'd like to explain it to you as much as I can. The graphics are beautiful. It looks like a 2.5D setting, because the backgrounds are a bit 3D... the voices are pretty matching. The characters are so darn awesome. My favorite character is Taokaka. She's just so cute of a cat / human hybrid. And the most importantly, the gameplay! It plays like an average fighting game, but with tons of anime paint on it. The controls were not too bad, although playing with a controller would probably be a better idea, it felt smooth at best. And I loved every single part of the game. If you like fighting, if you like cute, and if you like Taokaka as much as I do, go ahead and get it. It's so much fun. At least for me-ow!

However, the Fighting Game aspect of the game is offline only, so you need a second controller if you want to play with someone or you have to settle with AI that can be easily exploited. I give this port a 8/10 because I'm a fan of the story, but due to the fact that there is no online and the story itself has a lot of unanswered questions that are still not explained in Continuum Shift or Chrono Phantasma, sequels to the game that expand the story and offline play in many ways, I'd say if you aren't a Blazblue fan this would be a 6/10 game.

I always loved PC gaming and never really wanted to expand outside of it except for console exclusives.\nI always thought it was stupid Arcsys was afraid to publish on PC again because GFWL was a peice of ♥♥♥♥ and caused piracy concerns.\nWith that said, this version of CT will never please a fan who is already caught up on the story. There's no online play, which takes away most of the fun of the fighter, and there's a lot of balancing issues that make it even difficult for couch-play.\nIt's also really hard to recommend it to someone totally new because CT's story isn't even that great. A lot of it is filler and doesn't really expand onto the universe. CS can summarize the plot just fine at the start.\n\nBasically, it's a buggy, unbalanced, stripped version of the original that isn't worth most peoples  time. You can even pick up a copy of CT from a bargain bin cheaper than how much it is on the steam store.","February 15, 2014","false","4.2"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","16","31","0","7"

These are the people who made Guilty Gear, so yeah.\n\nTHE PROBLEM:\nThe big problem with this game is not with the game itself, it's with the port. What can be said for this port is it's terrible, it's really not good enough.\nIt's really disappointing and leaves the game vastly inferior to the console version.\nThe way they've set up the fighting for keyboard is ridiculous and I suggest you get a controller hooked up. Some menus you can't even go back from and you'll have to force the game to close, then relaunch it. There's no online versus mode in this port.\nThere are huge glaring problems with this port.\nHOWEVER!\nI'm willing to accept this. Later games in the franchise already improved on the game so Calamity Trigger is a little outdated in comparison. And here is why I think you should buy this.\nFor the sake of sequels. Show that there's an interest for this franchise to come to PC. This one doesn't cost much, and to me it shows this more of a product to test out the waters. If we show interest in this they'll probably invest more in a better team to port the sequels to PC (maybe fix this one) and just do this classic justice.\nI can only speak well of BlazBlue and it frustrates me to see so many's first impression ruined by this port. Hate the port, don't hate the game and developers.\n\nI've just come to love this game's style and its characters. In a way it's probably one of the most sophisticated and true fighting games in my opinion, all mechanically. The soundtrack is by the genius Daisuke Ishiwatari and it's amazing!\nVery visually appealing and has some great voice acting for its kind, even in the English dub. It also scores some bonus points for sharing some voice actors with League of Legends. (fx. Noel - Riven, Hazama - Wukong, Tager - Garen)\n\nIt runs with sprite animations and it may not be what people are used to but it works just fine.\nYou don't really have to like anime to get into this I'd say, but if you're not into anime you may have to extend you tolerance quite a bit. It's story involves alot of space/time continuum and may be hard to follow but it's really good.\nMaybe I'm wearing pink heart-shaped glasses here... I just really love this game's style.\n\nDamn, I hope they release the rest on Steam. Let's keep a lookout for Continuum Shift and Chrono Phantasma!","February 13, 2014","true","3.8"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

Something that BlazBlue lacks is a large selection of characters (there are 12 in total). Though, because of that, every single character has their own unique fighting style and personality. The pace of this game is just right and the characters are somewhat balanced once you get a grip of their combos/attacks. BlazBlue's soundtracks are also great, more than that; they're included when you buy this game!\n\nThis game features a story mode which requires you to play through all character's story to unlock more content. It's basically a visual novel. With that said, there are different paths you can take which leads to different endings.\nSurprisingly the story of this game was quite deep (complex?) and far more what I've expected. It was quite entertaining and it did add a lot more value to the game. The voice acting for some characters however (like Ragna) was terrible, while others (Rachel) was really good.\nAnd of course, there is an arcade mode as well!\n\nIf you're new to this genre, watch a gameplay of this game. That's probably the best way to find out if this is a game for you (there are no gameplay videos in the store page).\n\nI personally don't really care about online mode, thus I did not take it inconsideration when I made this into one of my recommended games. As of now, there is no online mode.","February 15, 2014","true","22.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I am leaving this review up anyway, but CSE makes a better entry point into the series with Calamity Trigger being an additional purchase for those who want to experience the alternate routes.\n\nBlazblue features a great sci-fi story told via visual novel sections interspersed with the best 2D fighter gameplay I've ever experienced.\n\nThe story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world in which society has already been rebuilt and futuristic tech that runs off magic has been developed. The lore is quite complicated, but most of it is explained in the non-canon "Teach Me, Miss Litchi" segments, which consist of light-hearted skits performed by super-deformed versions of the game's main characters. Having the lore explanations separate from the main game allows for the main storylines to move at a decent pace. However, in Calamity Trigger the "Teach Me, Miss Litchi" segments are unlocked as you play the game, so you may end up completely lost while playing the main story. As for tone, there is a serious story in the game that is told in a serious manner, but there is also an abundance of humour and gag routes in the series.\n\nThe actual gameplay seems to cater to both hardcore competitive fighter fans and unskilled casual players (like me). Combos are easy to pull off and flow together well, all the special moves have simple inputs and can even be mapped to a single button/key/analogue stick flick, and the easy difficulty is rather easy. There's more that appeals to the hardcore crowd, but as this version lacks online play, said people are better off with the console version, which they would likely already own. I had a hard time with hard difficulty and some normal fights, so there may be a challenge to be had for those who want one, but not as much of a challenge as you could have against human players.\n\nThe PC version seems to play just as well as the console versions, but lacks online play, so it's vs. computer and local play only. The included soundtrack features a lot of metal, but also has some symphonic rock. There are 42 tracks, but some short audio clips such as the "[character] vs. [character]" screen music is included, so it's more like 34 songs.\n\nHighly recommended, unless Continuum Shift Extend is an option, as that contains a condensed version of Calamity Trigger's story complete with most of the memorable fights as well as minor beneficial tweaks, the entirety of Continuum Shift, and a few extra story routes not found elsewhere.","March 6, 2014","true","9.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

And a great looker too. Couple of downsides are that the Character pool is a bit small. And as stated by other people there is no online feature which could bore you prety quickly. I myself will probably get the €2,49 I paid out of it. Great soundtrack and nice animations. Boss battles in arcade felt pretty cheap TBH.\n\nIt's combat system took a little getting used to as a person who plays Street figher 4 Arcade edition and Skullgirls It felt a bit weird at first but now that I get it it's fine. I recommend a Controler, but that is more of a personal thing since I think Keybaord is a bit off for fighting games.\n\nTL;DR:\nPros: Nice Anamations and Grapics. Nice Soundtrack.\nCons: No online and small Character pool.

Story is pretty hard to understand until you play all the routes of every character (so this means you have to replay the same character two or three more times to get 100% and also save often!). Since its a visual novel, expect lots of text to read.\n\nSprites are also 720p, i would strongly recommend to set the resolution to 1280x720p either arcade or full. The only downside, there is a 30fps bug. To resolve this problem just reboot your computer.\n\nHowever, if you are going to buy this game remember that the online BB community is on the latest blazblue game, which would be Chronophantasma Extend. If you want to know the Calamity Trigger story, there are two options: buy Continuum Shift Extend (it has a summarized chapter with all the routes of every character combined without gags) or read the story on blazblue wiki.","September 25, 2014","true","8.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Ice car 24/7.\n\nBut on a serious note, play the console version instead (preferably the sequels with more moves, proper balacing, and much needed resource limitation that prevents spamming cheap moves), this is a buggy offline mess with occasional disappearing sprites. Still fun, has an interesting (if not complicated) story, an amazing soundtrack, and looks beautiful with its hand drawn animation down to the very fluid background, but it'd be better against real people than cold calculative Nu-12 AIs or the ninja like Hakumen AI who can perform the keep-you-in-place-the-entire-fight-perfectly-and-burst-you-down combo. Because this doesn't have online play. None at all. Only local.\n\nI also need to remember Jin doesn't have a 236 236 D or a 5 C yet and Hakumen still heavily relies on counterattacks to fill up his magatama, goddammit, reflexes, go away.","July 1, 2014","false","2.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

Its soundtrack keeps you on your feet at all times, best part is, it comes with the soundtrack in its files for FREE (Legitimately)! Character variety is also great, also this game has alot of waifus, so your list may go up significantly and looking up Noel Vermillion or Litchi Faye Ling may clog up your internet history, sorry 'bout that.

This game is an outdated, badly ported, mess of a title. After following the examples of how to make this game run decently, I would still suggest that it isn't worth $10 on Steam. Buy it on console if you are interested. It will actually work and probably cost less.\n\nOnce the game is downloaded, it locks you into around 30fps. If you are even a mediocre fighting game player, you will know that that is a dealbreaker. There are also the lag spikes you would normally see from a bad console to PC port that is all too common on steam. The second deal breaker is that this title is very outdated in format. There is a reason developers put out new, updated titles in a franchise like fixing the engine, not just to make money. An outdated format brings me to the last deal breaker, there is no online. Some of us, me included, bought Clamity trigger just to have a blazblue game to play since I do not own a console. No online isn't a fatal fault, but a fault nonetheless.\n\nI would also rather not suggest people buy the game just in hope of better ports and updated titles to the franchise. Why show support for Arc when they have shown how little effort they are willing to put into a port already? I would much prefer donating to a fundraising campaign with the incentive of a decent port so that there is some form of obligation to make a good product by the developers. I will not give a hollow smile and say "Good effort out there! You will do better next time I'm sure." What I hope is that this was just a prototype for Arc to practice on and that the next titles will be actually playable.","July 1, 2014","false","1.6"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

Scratch that, at least it has a decent story pacing, I'll give it that, but congradulations, we once again have another game where people who know what they're doing combo lock you to hell and everyone else button mashes.\n\nSeriously, if you're going to make a deep combat system with combo breaks, counter moves, unique character interactions, give me some where I can learn a bunch of them at a time.

Not at all.\n\n\nTo be fair, Balzblue gets a thumbs up because it works well for one, and looks great and runs smooth. It is a good fighting game that is complete and it adds elements that will probably get better over time.\n\nHowever, for me, that's where it ends. For me, it feels like I'm playing soul calibur in 2d. Where certain characters can pretty much tap their way through all of your moves, or defeat you by actively countering all of your efforts and then relentlessly comboing you to death or near death and following up with the most bland way of killing you. And while it is obvious it needs to be a win or lose type of game, It does the game elements no justice at all to have regular ai in a game that could easily play insanely vibrantly like marvel vs capcom 3 or more accurately matrimelee.\n\nOnce you start playing or in my opinion, mashing, you'll notice Blazblue has tried their best to make every element count and have proper drawbacks, however, some more direct characters can actively push through the game with little to no technique, only to be floored by an ai that is akin to mugen making you suffer through some of the more tasteless but possible combos of the game. Things like rapid cancelling and air combos seem to have no proper airtime in the game although they could really REALLY show their stripes anywhere.\n\nI don't know if they have stressed those mechanics in later games, And I do wish that the pc release has saw some sort of upgrade. However, as far as new fighting game IPs go, the later versions are usually large improvements over the last game, Though, when people boldly say Blazblue is the best 2d fighter made, I really want to ask them to name 5 fighting games and will flat out call them liars if they name any 2d fighting game with an intact air combo system. I hope they at least try to bring the latest release to steam and see what people do with it as a community, then actively fill in the gap of missing titles in the series... Because I am sure that this game is no longer an accurate summary of where the game has actually headed. And nobody is ever going to take the pc genre of the series seriously if most of the heavy hitters are just cash cows left to make devs direct income... showing from ill optimized titles like kof13 which pretty much runs like dry snot unless you can run games which actually need the power and skull girls which actually made a great anti piracy joke.\n\nAll in all, it is a fun game, however, there just doesn't feel like there's enough to leave this as a game in itself rather than another beat the ai title. Characters who are normally only for slapping around players who think you're going to do the obvious move or slash you into the cracks of the road are met with ai that is ready to grab your ankles to interrupt you and shoot a projectile while you're getting up to kill you off just as easy as they're willing to ground slash you as much as possible until you figure out it's basically soul calibur and unless you learn how to string together the foolproof-only-way-out-is-perfect-guard-combo, you'll be eating the equivalent down the line.\n\nAnd before you swear it off for that, It's not too bad, but it does randomly turn into a cheese fest instead of just beat you. And you may find yourself using the simplest of moves and sticking to solid motions and attacks rather than what looks good when they do that, and it is sort of a shame that the battles do not really last long enough to literally combo foes upstage, or that you will waste so much energy trying to experience those elements when you can use the small array of specials they have properly and do exponentially more damage.\n\nFrom my opinion, Tough sell at full price, yet good to have, but sour to know the genre is missing on pc. Lastly, It feels almost like a requirement to try to complete everything when the roster is this small, While in other games you have quite a bit before you've actually fought EVERYONE and feel like you need to pick up someone else rather than master or use only one person. And the fact they have unlockable super moves... Sigh... If you're even remotely a completionist you will have to do this. Anyway, nice game, far from the best fighter, great fighter on steam, Bring more love to steam.","November 3, 2014","true","10.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Thank you and have fun.\n\nI've played the original BlazBlue on Xbox (Arcade) and I love it that they did a remake on that game (or more like a PC port). My expections were pretty high and I didn't get dissapointed!\n\nBut first thing first:\n-> Spoiler warning for the story! If you haven't played the "real ending",skip to the next arrow!\n-The Story:\nThere isn't really much of a story... it's a tournament fighter like Street Fighter,what do you expect? Oh well,here's the Story: Ragna and his brother Jin were normal boys who lived in a church/an orphanage with nuns. One day the building started to burn and Ragna quickly noticed it (He was in the Woods BTW). As he retuned,Jin was standing there,telling him that he's the reason this happened. At first he didn't understand,but then it was too late. Jin cut off Ragna's arm. Now we're skipping ahead at least 10 years. Ragna's grown up and wants to get revenge for his arm and the nuns Jin had killed. On his way to Jin he met some people and most of em' wanted his "Azure Grimoire", wich is giving him Demon like powers. At the NOL HQ,the meets Jin to finally settle the score, but they were interrupted when a gate opened,that connected the "Real World" to the "Under World". There he met V-13,a robot like girl who says that she's his sister. In the final cutscene, Rachel Alucard uses a spell with wich she's trying to close the gate. Of course, it didn't work\n-> Spoiler free Arrow right here!\nAnd thats the whole story! Of course, it's incomplete. It's getting more complete in the 2nd game,Continuum Shift,wich will be soon available on Steam. Overall the story is Ok.\n\n-The Characters:\nThis is an interessting thing to talk about. You have 11 playable characters. Those would be "Ragna the Bloodedge","Bang Shishigami","Jin Kisaragi","Noel Vermillion","Carl Clover","Rachel Alurad","Taokaka","Litchi Faye-Ling","Arakune","V-13" and "Hakumen",Each with differen attack speeds and Distortion Finishes. And that's really a shame. Don't get me wrong,I like the characters, but in what minds did they think to leave out Hazama??? He is one of,if THE, coolest characters in this entire game! But he's only an NPC... at least he's playable in Continuum Shift.\n\n-The Gamemodes:\nThat's a simple one. There are only some modes. Story,Arcade and Online. There are the most important ones and the only ones.\n\n-The Gameplay:\nThis game plays as you would expect it to. There's a light,medium and heavy attack button,Special attack buttons, Combos for Distortion Finishes (ect.). If you've ever played any fighting game like Street Fighter or Tekken,you know how to play BlazBlue!\nThere's nothing more to say to this I guess... Moving on!\n\n-The Graphic:\nOh my god, the graphic... It's so beautiful. All characters look like they belong in an Anime, the intro cutscene and some other cutscenes are drawn (Animestyle) and the backgrounds are not just "there", they feel alive because something's allways happening! If you're a fan of Anime,you're gonna like the visuals of this game,bright and shiny on one side, dark and kinda scary on the other. A perfect mix!\n\n-The Music:\nI've saved the best for last!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8pKHTS0nh8  THIS says everything I need to say. The music a AWSOME! It's Powerfull,Epic and most importantly remindable. If I think about BlazBlue, the song that always comes to my mind would be Taokakas theme. It's so happy and *Derp* at the same time...It's perfect for Taokaka.\n\nAll in all,this game ROCKS! You should DEFINATLY,DEFINATLY buy this game! C'mon! Buy it allready! Go ahead!\n\nMy final Score for this game is 10/10 Points. It's simply a masterpiece.\n\nHeeeeey,you made it to the end! Thanks for reading my Review of BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger! Hope you liked it!!!","November 21, 2014","true","3.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

The game does not support Online Multiplayer. It only supports local Multiplayer, which it will be forcing you to only play the game's Arcade mode and Story mode if you are alone.\n\nThe game also have some issues. They are not severe ones, but still some that showcase this version was not fully polished. But they do not break the game experience.\n\nIf you are searching for an interesting fighting game that you can play alone or locally with a friend, this version of the game will be good for you. Just don't forget to reboot your PC after booting the game for the first time cause the game will run with a FPS of 30 instead of 60...\n\nOtherwise, if you are a big Online Multiplayer gamer, you should either avoid this purchase or wait for a patch that grants online Multiplayer,","March 20, 2014","false","9.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The base game, as it should be, is the same as its console version, so if you require a review about it in general, there's quite a ton around.\n\nLet's focus on the PC version.\n\nPros: - The controls are as fine as they ever were with gamepad support.\n\nCons: - No online multiplayer unlike its console version. (As stated on the store page)\n- Limited graphical options. Anti-aliasing, some bloom effects, and resolutions being the only modifiable sets. Its            understandable considering the game's age as well as intended platform, but still disappointing nonetheless.\n- In window mode, the max resolution is 1600 x 960.\n- No mouse support. Although this is more of an optional piece rather than something that would've counted against the game, it would've been better with having the bare option.\n- A character sprite GLITCH. When playing on full screen and in the middle of combat, if the game was alt-tabbed and reopened, both character sprites on screen will be invisible, leaving only their shadows to guide you.\n\nAll in all, as much as I am a fan of the franchise, I cannot recommend the game as is (the date of this review.) I thank H2 Interactive Co. for allowing this port to come to PC, but there are a few things that could've been better done. The lack of online mutliplayer restricts it to being a couch-local player game; granted there have been half-baked online multiplayer with terrible infrastructure. Blazblue on the PC is not at all a terrible port, but it doesn't live up to standard it had set on consoles.","February 16, 2014","false","0.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I'd heard what I'd heard, and little of it good, but still...a 7.5 wasn't too much to ask, was it?\n\nThis game is, in a nutshell, Guilty Gear if it was trying too hard. For someone who has played this, GG and P4A, it's so easy to see this as the middle child, with neither the love and care of the former, nor the time-tested wisdom of the latter.\n\nThe character designs in this game are atrocious. Each character has been over-designed to the point of becoming completely generic and uninteresting, a feat which I'd've thought impossible. Ragna the Bloodedge, a main character with a name somehow stupider than Sol Badguy, looks like an anime character merged with a matryoshka doll. You could shuck ten layers off this character and still not get to the actual man beneath. Every anime trope is piled on these characters in order to make them memorable, and a similar concept has been followed with the game's combat.\n\nThe Drive button is an interesting idea. I can see how it evolved into the P4A persona attacks. But here, it creates a combat system that is equal parts chaotic and clunky. I fully admit to scrub status; I am not particularly GOOD at Blazblue. But that is irrelevant here; I'm terrible at 3rd Strike, I'm terrible at P4A, I'm terrible at friggin Skullgirls; but it doesn't impact my enjoyment of the game.\n\nWith only local co-op available, the AI's gotta stand up. And it just doesn't. Set it to highest difficulty, pick Officer Moe, and spam Down+D. Oh, look what happened. PERFECT.\n\nIs it? Is it really?\n\nMain takeaway? People like to play fighting games for a lot of reasons, and the big two for me are the feel of the combat, and the design of the characters. And in both cases, Arcsys seems to have taken the approach of "throw stuff at a wall and see what sticks."\n\nWhat they didn't realize is that the wall was sticky. Very sticky.\n\nFor reasons.\n\nLookin' at you, Faye-Ling.","June 23, 2014","false","11.3"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

If you like 2D fighters like Guilty Gear, this is great game too pick up. It's made by the same people as GG, so you can expect some similarities. It doesn't have a huge character roster, but the chacters are diverse in their playstyles. There is English voice acting, which is a plus in my book, and the story mode is actually good for a fighting game. There is no online play that I know of, which could be a turn-off to some, but I do much of that anyway. It's just a quality game that is easy to pick up but tough to master.

Not only does this version lack online play, but I have tried and failed to get local play working, so even if you have friends nearby you won't be able to play with them.\nHowever, there is one saving grace to this game, which makes it a worthy purchase, and that is the fact that this game comes bundled with the soundtrack. While it is missing a few songs from the game (most unfortunately Bang's Fu-Rin-Ka-Zan theme), this two-disc set is absolutely wonderful, with several rocking tracks that absolutely deserve to be in your music playlist. Also, the game offers some good single player content (especially the story mode), to kinda make up for the complete lack of multiplayer.\n\nTL;DR: Crappy port of the game, but you get an awesome OST so it's still worth the buy.","June 21, 2014","true","29.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(More Guilty Gear, BlazBlue, and maybe Persona4Arena PC?)\n\nEssentially the GFWL version now without GFWL, the Steam version now lacks Online and apparently still suffers from the same issues.\n\nBeing the first entry of the series, Calamity Trigger is a bit simpler than the other combo heavier sequels and revisions (characters being given more move set options) but all 3 main entries in the series try different balance mechanics that make them play a bit different. With Dashes, a Parry system, Barrier blocking, a simple "revolver" combo system (A > B > C > D move links) and Cancel options, the pacing can get pretty hectic in BlazBlue.\n\nAside from the PC versions (Steam and Windows 8 Store), I've only played the PSP version of Calamity Trigger and the Steam version appears to be a port of the home console versions meaning that it lacks the addition of Legion mode from the PSP port and the BlayzBloo Shop (there are still unlocks from the shop available.)\n\nIf you don't mind having to restart your PC to get rid of the framerate issue that appears after a while of PC uptime (fps sinks to a capped 30) every time, the PC versions of the BlazBlue games have almost instant loading times for matches (you can skip the matchup screens not long after they pop up) which make them my preferred versions, having played the latest 2 installed on the PS3.\n\nThe included OST appears to be the one from the console's US Limited Edition as 320kbit mp3 files.","June 23, 2014","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is just bare bones, and that's it's only problem. It doesn't have Gag Reels like CS and CP. To play this game, I can jump right in because I'm boss with Noel, but to lack my other mains, kinda hurts. I can't wait for a hopeful release of CP or even CS here. CP would be a dream come true! I wouldn't need a PS3 to play it! My computer runs this fine, and it isn't hard to run. BB is a series I could recommend to any fighting game lover. 8.5 out of 10. Bare bones, but good.

But this game is also worth getting for the fact that you can play versus games on local co-op, in addition to the story.

This version is a suprisingly good port, though it can feel slow at times with the framerate always around 30 FPS. There is no online, though this honestly doesn't affect me much, as I've never been much for online play.

A slow movement speed and 4-button attack system make it acceptable to play this game with a standard ps3/xbox controller instead of a more specialized fight stick. Once you're into the game however, a variety of rules and systems need to be understood and learned before you can really get anywhere.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/centurionzeta/recommended/263300/","centurionzeta","ZodiAC","http://steamcommunity.com/id/centurionzeta/","81 products in account","There are two things I like about Arc System Works (who made Guilty Gear and Persona 4 Arena): all of the bgm in their work is kick ♥♥♥, and their games are so good that I actually postpone reviewing them to play them more, much like BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger.\n\nBlazBlue: Calamity Trigger is the first installment of Arc System Works' BlazBlue series. Taking Place in the 13th hierarchical city of Kagutsuchi, Calamity Trigger displays the city after six legendary heroes defeated the infamous "Black Beast." Ever since then, the Novus Orbis Librarium (a.k.a the NOL or the Library) has governed Kagutsuchi. Soon afterwards, the village of Ikaruga openly rebelled and was quickly destroyed. Now the Library rules with a tight grip, punishing anyone who defies them with death. Although it doesn't really explain it in the opening cutscene to story mode, Arc System Works made Kagutsuchi feel like an oppressed city through the backgrounds showing guards locking down certain stages, to even some of the characters who work for the NOL. Much other than that, BlazBlue focuses less on the big picture and more on the interactions between characters and their complicated relationships.\n\nBlazBlue is an absolutely gorgeous game, each hand drawn sprite looks great and is animated spectacularly. The character backgrounds also play off of the characters backstories and reflects them through the stages, like Taokaka, who comes from a poor village of cat-like people. On her stage, you can see members of her village chasing chickens around trying to eat them. All of the characters special moves, distortion drives, and astral heats are smooth and stylish.\n\nAs if the story and graphics don't appease to me enough, the flashy yet simple combat system made me feel like a bad ♥♥♥ in no time. Playing off the revolver system (attacks go from weak to strong), BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger s simple enough to pick up and start doing combos yet complex enough for seasoned vets to dish out some real damage. The crux of Calamity Trigger's play style and one best parts of the game is the "Drive" system. In a nutshell, no to characters play alike. Ragna the Bloodedge's drive Soul Eater steals health from the opponent and adds it to his own if he sustained damage. Jin's Frostbite freezes opponents on the spot, allowing for devastating combos. Arc also did a great job balancing out the characters. Now Tager, a beefy character with a large hitbox and no double jump or dash, can have a chance with his high damage output against Taokaka, one of the fastest characters in the game and deals a small amount of damage. The only thing I don't like, however, is when they ported Calamity Trigger to Steam, something happened and there is no online multiplayer, meaning you'll have to be sitting next to your friend to fight him.\n\nVerdict:\n+Beautiful graphics\n+addictive gameplay\n+Awesome Soundtrack\n+Balanced Roster\n-No Online Multiplayer\n\n9.5 Outstanding\n\nEven if Calamity Trigger isn't your favorite BlazBlue title, it is still fun plus you get the soundtrack to boot. Hopefully in the future, if it's successfull enough, Arc System Works will put Continuum Shift and Chronophantasmna on Steam as well (with online capability too).

You have two types of Light and Strong attacks and a ton of combos to make you feel like a fighting game badass! Characters all feel very different so you can easily pick your favourite\n\nGraphics:\nCharacters look great and the 3D stage backgrounds have a lot of detail in them, however you will probably fare better with the default resolution that your native resolution fot your monitor, because the game when scaled improperly looks like crap.\nAlso 31 fps cap is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t\n\nSounds and Music:\nSound quality isn't that great compared to the console versions and the english voice acting is a little glitched, but the japanese voice acting sounds gorgeous and the soundtrack of this game will rock your socks and underwear off!\n\nOverall:\ngreat game but still would recommend buying the PS3 or Xbox360 version, because the game looks and sounds better and it has online play, hope Arc system works will fare better with future ports of Continuum Shift and Chrono Phantasma.","June 23, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This has prompted me to seek out the console versions of the games and I can now say I'm a solid fan of the series now and easily my fav. fighting game. I know the PC port of the game has some short comings, mainly the omission of online multiplayer. How that happened in this day in age I have no idea, but I will say this regarding the pc port of the game it's my preferred choice if I'm playing local multiplayer or a single player game. Now that I have played the console versions of the game (all are great ports) the PC one for me in my personnel opinion seems to run smoother and just look better as it supports a higher resolution then the console counter parts.  My advise get both if you can, if multiplayer is not an issue get the pc one if you need to play online get the console one.

Occasional bugs experienced such as glitchy sprites, especially prominent when alt-tabbing. Netplay no longer functions as well which is a huge let down.\n\nHowever despite all of this the core gameplay is left unaltered and retains it's characteristics which seperate it from most other typical fighters such as the diverse character styles and wonderful soundtrack.\n\nPersonally I bought this in hopes that some of the other games will be ported considering this is one of the weaker games in the series. However if you are not put of by the lack netplay I would certainly reccomend this for the arcade mode alone. Having the soundtrack is also a bonus, and for £6.99 it's worth a shot even if you are unfamiliar with the series.","February 28, 2014","true","26.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not only does this version lack online play, but I have tried and failed to get local play working, so even if you have friends nearby you won't be able to play with them.\nHowever, there is one saving grace to this game, which makes it a worthy purchase, and that is the fact that this game comes bundled with the soundtrack. While it is missing a few songs from the game (most unfortunately Bang's Fu-Rin-Ka-Zan theme), this two-disc set is absolutely wonderful, with several rocking tracks that absolutely deserve to be in your music playlist. Also, the game offers some good single player content (especially the story mode), to kinda make up for the complete lack of multiplayer.\n\nTL;DR: Crappy port of the game, but you get an awesome OST so it's still worth the buy.","June 21, 2014","true","29.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From my perspective, the only reason I'd buy this game is if you wanted the soundtrack, which is a kickass soundtrack, but still. The other reason is if you were curious about some bad endings and gag reels you could have missed in story mode. If the game had online support that'd be one thing, but there isn't any so there's little incentive to keep playing. I say get it if it goes on sale for the soundtrack or if you just want to support it and try to get more Arc System Works games on PC.

This game is just bare bones, and that's it's only problem. It doesn't have Gag Reels like CS and CP. To play this game, I can jump right in because I'm boss with Noel, but to lack my other mains, kinda hurts. I can't wait for a hopeful release of CP or even CS here. CP would be a dream come true!

The game is a fantastic exclamation point, and one that pushes the boundaries of 2D fighting games. It's a hardcore game that also can be fun to the amateurs of this genre, but make no mistake; the challenge is here if you want it. Overall, this is a wonderful addition to the genre and it exemplifies why 2D fighters are still alive and kicking.\n\nAt first glance the game is a beautiful masterpiece. All character models are drawn in high-res sprites. Backgrounds are done in 3D, and the blend of both equate to a wonderful convergence of visuals. The game is pretty to say the least. Each character also has a fun and quirky style reminiscent of Guilty Gear's lineage of outlandish character stock. We have cat girls, huge breasted beauties, mechanical marionettes, and countless odd yet cool fighters. If you can find your own quirk, there is bound to be a respectable character to scratch that itch within the game's 12 playable fighters.\n\nSound, too, boasts a caliber of oomph, which is usually accompanied by a mash-up of heavy metal riffs and classical music. While to some this might be an irritating soundtrack, I didn't find it to be annoying and it blended quite well with the high-intensity fights on screen. The one thing that can detract from the experience is the constant yelling and yelping that accompanies each move characters make. Some are more irritating than others (Tao for example comes to mind--meow, meow, meow...) but overall, the battle cries aren't excruciating, and after a few moments you drown it out into the background.\n\nGameplay itself is where the meat is, and with that players divulge into two camps; the ones that button mash, and those that take the time to master the mechanics. It's totally up to you how you approach the game, but to the dedicated they will find a rich experience to sink their teeth into. There are four attack buttons: weak, medium, strong, and Drive. The first three are self explanatory, the fourth, Drive, is a special attack that utilizes a characters special ability. While this array of button layout may seem tame compared to other fighters, in combination with quarter-circles, half-circles and the like, the game opens up considerably and the emphasis of quick dash and strike attacks takes over.\n\nThis is where the depth of the game shines. Knowing what moves and attacks do what kind of damage and how it affects the opponent is the key to opening up an opportunity to create a combo string. There are also two gauges, one controlling your guard and the other your super. Combine these with cancels, grabs and others, and you have quite and arsenal to kick some...well you know.\n\nOnce you think yourself decent, take the game to its various modes. You have your mandatory training, arcade and versus mode. These are self explanatory, but there are others. Story is an interesting change to the formula for this genre, as there is an actual story to follow. Granted the story here isn't amazing, but it is entertaining and the way the game forces you to choose different paths to unveil the whole story is interesting and a welcomed change to the usual we've seen before in this genre.\n\nAlong with story mode you have Score Attack (a variation of survivor mode) and Network, its online component. Online is pretty basic with player and ranked matches and you can watch a match along with four other people. The online mode is regular 1v1, but be forewarned, there are some top notch caliber people out there right now so you might be outgunned. If you have friends who have the game you can always set up a private match for a more balanced game. As of now, the online portion is very solid without any lag and most people whom I've come across have been cordial and stayed through the whole game. Obviously this can be different in your location but I live in Scotland and I've had zero lag issues online--two thumbs up to Arc Systems.\n\nOverall, the game is a true keeper. If you are tired and feel Street Fighter and others alike have become stale, give this a definite buy.\n\nBlazBlue is a MUST BUY.\n","May 23, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Granted one can play the game simply mashing buttons and getting lucky, but the more you play you discover it's much more effective and fun to learn counters, abilities, and proper timing for attacks to achieve victory. A game that I love to hate in a sense that some fights seem impossible and after losing 100+ times in a row against the comp. you're ready to throw your controller at the wall, but then realize how much more rewarding it will be to defeat them, and it is just that very rewarding.

Despite all this awesomeness in the story it will lead you around in circles if you are looking to get 100% completion to get the full story, a game guide is importent here if you want to get your endings right, most likely the main ending for most of the characters is a distiortion finish win for each battle, but you are going to have a hard time finding the others for example: Litchi has only one canon ending and 5 whole non canon endings, this would be nearly impossible to complete withought the aid of a guide.\n\nVerdict:\nBlazeBlue: CT is a great game graphically and storyline wise, it lacks in the first time player ease and if you dont have someone to help you out you are going to have a hard time, read the forums and find out the terms such as dragon punch standing C and dial A to get a understanding of how to play before starting as fighters may seem simple to the untrained eye, but they are by far the most complex type of game out there as you have to think watch and react and execute in a very small amount of time, consider yourself good at FPS? you may have the reaction time but try thinking through which special you should execute while in a j9 (forward jump) all in a fraction of a second, and you soon begin to see why these games are considered to be the most difficult type. however this has an upside, almost everyone in the community has a large amount of respect for one another because they all know how hard it is and are always willing to lend a hand to the newbs out there. And when you become good too you will be able to replay it again and again against a friend or in the storyline for years and years to come.\n\n\nenjoy and fuel your inner otaku XD (-3-)","May 10, 2014","true","29.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But this was also done to see that if Arc System Works could port future titles to the PC. I'll cut to the chase right now. If you never played BlazBlue and you have a hunch for 2D Fighting games like Street Fighter then I highly reccomend BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger. Though if you already played this game before then there is no reason to go back into this port. But for Newcomers Calamity Trigger is Highly reccomened.\n\nDeveloped by the people who made the wonderful Guilty Gear titles BlazBlue was basically the first real HD title to be devolped by Arcs. The game features 12 Characters all hand drawn and they look amazing. The fighting system uses four buttons and it easy to do stuff like quarter circle moves here and there. But if you really want to get most out of the game then practice you're combos well. Also I highly reccomened starting off with the beginner friendly characters like Ragna, Jin and Noel. Once you master thoes characters you can always move on to the other characters. As there is a steeper learning curve for the rest of cast like V-13, Haku-Men, Iron Tager, Litchi, Rachel and a few more. Also just about all of the characters play different from eachother as nobody has the same fighting style. Plus BlazBlue comes with a Super Deep storyline for a fighting game. It will keep you busy for quite sometime and the branching paths make everything awesome. The presentation is all anime style and if you're a fan of that you'll love the art. Music is also incredible with a Heavy Metal style soundtrack. The soundtrack for me is the biggest highlight of the game.\n\nAlso if there is one major nitpick with the PC version is that there is no online. Which is quite dissapointing for some of us to thoes who want to test there skills across the world. Hopefully a patch will come soon for an online. Overall BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger is a great fighting to really get into. Though if you already played this game before on consoles like Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 and the Windows version there isn't anything to make you head back to it. Plus the lack of online may turn some people off. But overall this a high quality fighting game that can sit and join the ranks on titles like Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition and Mortal Kombat. If you never played the game support this games release and pray for future BlazBlue games  like Continuum Shift or if were ever lucky Chrono Phantasma... But lets we get more of these titles.","March 3, 2014","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All in all this game does have great music visuals, etc. In my opinion it does serve as a great alternative to other fighters, be it the Stret Fighter or MK series, if you're somewhat tired of those (not that they're bad by any means, but variety does help).\n\nMy issues with this game are relatively minor & can be largely overlooked. For starters, multiplayer is limited to local multiplayer, so if you have no one around that's willing to play, you're stuck playing against the AI. Secondly, as someone who predominately played fighters like the MK series, Street Fighter series, etc., & not so much the BlazBlue or Guilty Gear series, the learning curve seemed to be somewhat steep in terms of learning characters' mov lists. Lastly, & although I do not know if I should credit the game with this issue or it lies with my computer, but I did notice some slowdown. The fights' speed seemed akin to the pre-Turbo version of Street Fighter II. For the time being I'm giving Blazblue: Calamity Trigger the benefit of the doubt & placing the blame on my computer.\n\nAll in all, this game is fun, even with faults. Is it worth $9.99? Well the generic answer is yes, especially if you're a fighting game afficionado, a fan of Guilty Gear, and/or want alternatives/variety.","February 17, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's also the first fighter of its format that I got any good at. The story is a gorgeous incompressible fractal, the character design is full of strong aesthetic persona that pushes all my buttons, and the mechanics are so good that lesser games such as the Street Fighter series are now unplayable to me.\n\nThe way the input buffer is built allows you to jam on a button and then overwrite the input if you change your mind before the attack actually launches, provided you're fast enough. In that way it plays more like Soul Calibur and less like Mortal Kombat. That input buffer is the biggest deciding factor in whether I buy a fighting game now. The quick-sticking system is also a godsend to new players: push the analog stick in one of the up or right to do a character-specific special move, left to do a super move, and down to do a finisher after you unlock them. This is a system that should be in all fighting games.\n\nAlso a part of the Brawl Minus school of gameplay balance: when every character is OP, no one is. Each character breaks the rules of the game in their own unique way from Tao's directional air dashes to Hakumen's counter button and autocharging specials to Nu 13's intangible-dash cancels and ability to attack anywhere on the screen if you're precise enough.\n\nPro tip tho: don't rely on integrated graphics to play it. My laptop chugs a bit, and as a very technical player this can throw me off considerably in more intense matches. That or I've gotten so fast that I need a new controller, because I'm inputting moves faster than the analog stick's sample rate.\n\nThe franchise is part of my Platinum Collection. On PS3/360 I've put over 2k hours combined into this series, and now I get to buy them all over again on Steam.\n\nHurry up and release Chrono Phantasma: Extend on Steam so I can buy that too.","December 14, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is a fantastic exclamation point, and one that pushes the boundaries of 2D fighting games. It's a hardcore game that also can be fun to the amateurs of this genre, but make no mistake; the challenge is here if you want it. Overall, this is a wonderful addition to the genre and it exemplifies why 2D fighters are still alive and kicking.\n\nAt first glance the game is a beautiful masterpiece. All character models are drawn in high-res sprites. Backgrounds are done in 3D, and the blend of both equate to a wonderful convergence of visuals. The game is pretty to say the least. Each character also has a fun and quirky style reminiscent of Guilty Gear's lineage of outlandish character stock. We have cat girls, huge breasted beauties, mechanical marionettes, and countless odd yet cool fighters. If you can find your own quirk, there is bound to be a respectable character to scratch that itch within the game's 12 playable fighters.\n\nSound, too, boasts a caliber of oomph, which is usually accompanied by a mash-up of heavy metal riffs and classical music. While to some this might be an irritating soundtrack, I didn't find it to be annoying and it blended quite well with the high-intensity fights on screen. The one thing that can detract from the experience is the constant yelling and yelping that accompanies each move characters make. Some are more irritating than others (Tao for example comes to mind--meow, meow, meow...) but overall, the battle cries aren't excruciating, and after a few moments you drown it out into the background.\n\nGameplay itself is where the meat is, and with that players divulge into two camps; the ones that button mash, and those that take the time to master the mechanics. It's totally up to you how you approach the game, but to the dedicated they will find a rich experience to sink their teeth into. There are four attack buttons: weak, medium, strong, and Drive. The first three are self explanatory, the fourth, Drive, is a special attack that utilizes a characters special ability. While this array of button layout may seem tame compared to other fighters, in combination with quarter-circles, half-circles and the like, the game opens up considerably and the emphasis of quick dash and strike attacks takes over.\n\nThis is where the depth of the game shines. Knowing what moves and attacks do what kind of damage and how it affects the opponent is the key to opening up an opportunity to create a combo string. There are also two gauges, one controlling your guard and the other your super. Combine these with cancels, grabs and others, and you have quite and arsenal to kick some...well you know.\n\nOnce you think yourself decent, take the game to its various modes. You have your mandatory training, arcade and versus mode. These are self explanatory, but there are others. Story is an interesting change to the formula for this genre, as there is an actual story to follow. Granted the story here isn't amazing, but it is entertaining and the way the game forces you to choose different paths to unveil the whole story is interesting and a welcomed change to the usual we've seen before in this genre.\n\nAlong with story mode you have Score Attack (a variation of survivor mode) and Network, its online component. Online is pretty basic with player and ranked matches and you can watch a match along with four other people. The online mode is regular 1v1, but be forewarned, there are some top notch caliber people out there right now so you might be outgunned. If you have friends who have the game you can always set up a private match for a more balanced game. As of now, the online portion is very solid without any lag and most people whom I've come across have been cordial and stayed through the whole game. Obviously this can be different in your location but I live in Scotland and I've had zero lag issues online--two thumbs up to Arc Systems.\n\nOverall, the game is a true keeper. If you are tired and feel Street Fighter and others alike have become stale, give this a definite buy.\n\nBlazBlue is a MUST BUY.\n","May 23, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's also the first fighter of its format that I got any good at. The story is a gorgeous incompressible fractal, the character design is full of strong aesthetic persona that pushes all my buttons, and the mechanics are so good that lesser games such as the Street Fighter series are now unplayable to me.\n\nThe way the input buffer is built allows you to jam on a button and then overwrite the input if you change your mind before the attack actually launches, provided you're fast enough. In that way it plays more like Soul Calibur and less like Mortal Kombat. That input buffer is the biggest deciding factor in whether I buy a fighting game now. The quick-sticking system is also a godsend to new players: push the analog stick in one of the up or right to do a character-specific special move, left to do a super move, and down to do a finisher after you unlock them. This is a system that should be in all fighting games.\n\nAlso a part of the Brawl Minus school of gameplay balance: when every character is OP, no one is. Each character breaks the rules of the game in their own unique way from Tao's directional air dashes to Hakumen's counter button and autocharging specials to Nu 13's intangible-dash cancels and ability to attack anywhere on the screen if you're precise enough.\n\nPro tip tho: don't rely on integrated graphics to play it. My laptop chugs a bit, and as a very technical player this can throw me off considerably in more intense matches. That or I've gotten so fast that I need a new controller, because I'm inputting moves faster than the analog stick's sample rate.\n\nThe franchise is part of my Platinum Collection.

Best thing i like about this game you can actually beat both arcade and story mode even you suck at fighting games like i do. I do a lot button mashing or just repeat same move lol,Mortal Kombat  and Street fighter  can take notes from this game till this day i still haven't beaten shao kahn in mortal kombat 9! You wut m8 fite me irl!Jokes a side the thing i dislike the most is probably visual novel interaction i ♥♥♥♥ing hate visual novels but this game is unique because of it story is solid though and it's kinda pain in ♥♥♥ to complete because you have so many choices...I would  recommend anyone this game if you are into fighting games overall  i give it 8 out 10.","May 9","true","20.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
