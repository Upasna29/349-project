"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pukkk/recommended/393920/","Pukkk","Mr. Bisou Bisou","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pukkk/","661 products in account","When I saw this game in the Steam store I was really excited because it sort of reminded me of Game Dev Tycoon, the graphics seemed decent and the videos that showed the gameplay made it look like a fun game. Unfortunately it was far from my expectations. Here is a list I compiled of all the flaws I encountered:\nNot able to charge more than 1-1.5k$ profit on new car prices or nobody will buy your cars (imagine that for real life dealerships)\nThe creators solve this problem by saying "You need to find the sweetspot/price for a car to sell for" which is like saying "its a feature, not a bug", you should at least be able to give your sales staff margins (%) so they can cut the price a bit if a customer thinks it's too expensive.\nNot being able to change the price for options you sell on a car (Satnav, Audio system, Winter package.. all seem to sell for 500-600$)\nDuring the day you can only watch what happens to your company but not interact (only accept trade-ins), you can't even pause or close the game/go to main menu\nThere's no 'log', there should be a daily log with all your profit/income, expenses, parts used for repairs...\nAs noted above, sometimes you don't notice you're out of parts at the beginning of the day and there's nothing you can do all day long but see people come & go with their cars without paying because you don't have the parts to repair their car\nThe music is ever so repetitive (thank god you can turn it off.. AT THE MAIN MENU, for which you have to quit your current game)\nThere are no graphic settings at all\nThis is my opinion, but there should be an option to loan money from a bank or something similar because you HAVE to stock up on second hand cars because otherwise you will lose CSR but then you don't have enough money at the end of the day to buy your actual dealership cars & lose CSR that way because people can't buy your "official" cars\nNo way to create advertisements/marketing to get back your CSR, that melts away like icecream on a warm summer's day\nYou lose CSR too easy and gain it back too slow (sometimes at random if a customer doesnt even want to buy something, what's up with that?)\nThe new/used bias doesnt seem to make any difference\nThere should be a time indicator to show how far in the day you are progressed (simple clock or even a progress bar would be nice)\nEvery customer always seems to want anything that's NOT in stock. Like if you sell 3 types of cars, 20x car A, 10x  B & 0 x C (you don't have car C in stock anymore), 500 people will come to your sales guys & complain there's no car C left & drain your CSR like it's a free snickers giveaway at a Walmart. And if you have car C the day after, fully stocked, nobody will want it.\nThe same goes for second hand cars. Like once every 4 or 5 days one or two people will want to buy a second hand car but the one day you don't have any second hand cars on offer everything turns to hell and you will lose CSR so fast you can't even imagine because ofcourse at that exact day everyone needs a second hand car.\nThe auction system is so god damn slow and unclear. Sometimes I didn't even notice that the opponent made a bid because the color & font stays the same. Maybe change it to green if you are the current highest bidder?\nAlso if you buy a car at the auction and sell if for more than 250-300$ that you bought it for at the auction, people will go ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and not buy anything from you and again drain your CSR\nThere should be a possibility to have multiple savegames, now you can only continue or fully reset & start over your game\nThere should be more buildings & more variety. Every building is basicly exactly the same only a few pixels streched out. After you get to the last building the fun is gone in seconds because there's nothing left to do.\nIn stead of clicking with static 50$ price increaments for car prices, there should be a slider & text box where you can fill in a custom amount because if you buy cars at the auction you sometimes get ridiculous prices like 4731$ which doesnt seem to bother the customers but it does look weird to me.\nDid I mention CSR is nearly impossible to keep at a decent enough level to keep making enough money?\nThese are just my observations after playing a little over an hour.\n\nTl;dr: This game has a really good concept but it turned out way worse than it could've been. If this was an alpha or early access I would be very excited for it's future, but selling this as a fully completed game is not fair to the buyer and not worth the money, even at the price of 4.99€\n\nMy advice is, until all the features that should have been included are included, to not buy the game.","October 23, 2015","false","1.2"," 336 of 364 people (92%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","92","336","364","20","14"

Unfortunately, a great concept is completely squandered on this dreadfully boring and poorly designed game.  By about 30 minutes in, I had already figured out a "sweet spot" for pricing and stock levels.  From then on, it was "set it and forget it", with the only "gameplay" being tediously stocking cars and parts before the start of each day.\n\nPros:\nGraphics are not great, but sufficient for the genre\n\nCons:\n\nWhere to begin?\n\n(1) The economic model behind this game is terrible, especially for used cars.  There is no differentiation for quality of used cars in the game (no mileage or condition differences), yet two cars of the same model  can sell for wildly different prices, seemingly at random.  Since there is no method for price discovery, you are left randomly guessing at what a price should be.  This led me to just ignore used cars all together because they could sit on your lot forever, even if you set the price for thousands less than the "estimated" value.  (You only need to keep one or two on your lot at a time to avoid consumer rating penalties in case someone looking for a used car comes by and sees that you have none.  Even then, I just set the price at the lowest amount possible and they would still sit on the lot for a long time.)  This is SO disappointing since used cars are such a big profit generator at a real dealership.\n\n(2) If you have a car that isn't selling, you cannot set the price lower than what you paid for it.  So if you paid too much (like at an auction), you will be stuck with the car for a very long time.  And since it is impossible to tell whether you paid too much for a car (see 1, above) this is pretty much guaranteed to happen to you at some point.  Why not let us take the loss and move the inventory?  Ever hear of a loss leader?\n\n(3) The trade-in mechanics are pointless.  The sale will happen whether you accept the trade-in or not (which is completely unrealistic).  There is no negotiation of the price; you just accept the arbitrary price offered or not.  And because it is impossible to know whether that price is a "good" price (see 1, above), it is almost always better to just pass on the trade-ins.  Negotiating and dealmaking on trade-ins should be a fun and compelling part of the game, but the way it is implemented makes trade-ins completely pointless.\n\n(4) There is no challenge or "gameplay" in the personnel management portion of the game.  Because of the way that the new-car economics work in this game, the amount of money you make on a sale depends more on the quality of your sales staff, sales manager, and finance manager than on the price you set for the car.  Each employee has a single skill number and a price.  Price has no relation to skill level, and is low enough to not matter.  And all you can do with your employees is hire or fire them.  There is no negotiating of salaries or commissions, no promoting, no training or increasing stats/perks/etc.  So gameplay devolves to, hire the highest "rating" available (no matter the cost) at any given point in the game, and fire the lowest "rating" to make room for someone with a higher rating.  BORING!\n\n(5) The "service" portion of the game seems to be there only to add a little more tedium to an otherwise tedious game.  All you do is hire service employees (the highest "skill" you can find) and make sure they have enough parts each day.   Yes, you much manually restock parts EVERY turn.  There is no way to set a standing order to restock each turn.\n\n(6) Typical features of this type of game are missing, such as advertising budgets, buying on credit, comparing statistics to your competitors, etc.  The game misses many obvious elements, and feels unfinished.  I might be excited about it if it was an Early Access game, but sadly this is supposed to pass for a finished product.\n\nI wanted to like this game, but frankly, it just is not any fun.  It isn't even worth it at the $5 price point.  Do yourself a favor and take a pass.","October 26, 2015","false","4.2"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","32","33","0","0"

This game seemed like an enjoyable sim - management game judging from the screenshots and the video.

You only read lines of what each and every thing in the game does. There seems to be not much to do after all the long lines of the tutorial.\nYou basically set a price for the cars and buy/sell cars & car parts and wait for someone to buy your cars and parts...\n\nThis game is far from entertaining and fun to play.

For example, I was losing a lot of CSR because I didn't have a 'Cheapolla' or whatever it's called. I had just a bit over 18,000 dollars. Cheapollas cost 14,000 each. So, I could only one Cheapolla and start the day. When I started the day, customers came in, only asking for a Cheapolla. The first customer asked for a Cheapolla, and bought it. You would expect a lot more people to come in, and they did. All of them wanted a Cheapolla. As I explained, I only had one. So, I lost loads of CSR and got NO money because I had one Cheapolla and everyone else wanted one. It was an endless cycle of buying one car, losing that car, losing CSR and ending up with the same ammount of money as when I started the day. With this and a lot of other frustrating things, I have to give Auto Dealership Tycoon a 4/10. It has a few good things in it, but the other bad things drown those good things out. Auto Dealership Tycoon has the potential of being a good game, but it doesn't try hard enough. Unfortunately, I do not recommend Auto Dealership Tycoon.","October 27, 2015","false","1.1"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","1"

The core idea of running a car dealer is certainly here, but there is no real gameplay to back this up. The game is centred around keeping your stock up to the demand, but that's it. You buy parts, play the day and hope you make money. There is nothing more to it, besides hiring employees and buying buildings so you can make more money. This all might not be too bad if everything was clear, but I could not even see how what I had bought, so I only knew if I had enough of a car till the game said I had no more cars of a certain type. It's a shame because normally I love tycoon games, but this one lacks in a lot of aspects. There is no interesting gameplay to keep you invested in running your own car dealership and the lack of information makes this game even harder to play. There aren't a lot of tycoon games, but I suggest you pass on this one.","October 23, 2015","false","0.2"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","18","27","0","0"

Especially the random events you get (a customer had ♥♥♥♥ in the backseat of the car).\n\nThe idea is simple, you run a car dealership where you can set the prices, upgrade the building, run a service department and manage your used and new car inventory. When you upgrade your building, you get more showroom traffic and service department customers thus leading to more money. Be careful not to run out of inventory however or your Customer Service Rating will lower. The CSR affects how many customers will actually come to your dealership. The higher the better.\nSo what do I think of the game?\n\nIt's fun, maybe a bit too simplistic but it really does a great job of keeping the business management understandable and playable in a game format without providing over complicated mechanics (like dealing with accounting or the finance institution negotiations).  Personally, I love the random events that occur in the game, some are serious but others are hilarious. Even the random "special characters" that show up tend to spice up the gameplay (a customer who talks ♥♥♥♥ to you in the showroom). For 4.99, I highly recommend this game to anyone  who enjoys tycoon games or is just interested in a peek at running a car dealership!\n\nGameplay Review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Btvz07E3tNw","October 23, 2015","true","6.4"," 52 of 93 people (56%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","56","52","93","13","2"

Some of the negative reviews on this game complaining about not being able to mark up cars more than a few hundred dollars, or the seemingly random drops in CSR ratings actually made me laugh. Truth is, as someone who has spent several years working in the business, I can tell you that most new cars these days, especially on the lower end of $20k, have markups in the 800-1200 range, and that's MSRP, actual selling prices can at times be under invoice, especially where a sales event is happening, like portrayed in the game. The fact that the game will consistently let you make $500 or more on a new car could be considered unrealistic. Used cars you can make a few on, and that's also fairly accurate.\n\nAs to the CSR, while at times customers that don't buy a car will go anywhere and everywhere they can online to denounce your dealership, often it's people who actually BUY cars that drop negative surveys, that doesn't happen in this game. Also, that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the white hat in this game really exists. Everyone who has ever worked at a car dealership has met him.\n\nConspicuously, the "I need to talk to my wife/husband" objection is missing, but the rest of the most common ones are there.\n\nOverall, if you're into tycoon type games, it's not a bad experience. If you're not a tycoon game kind of person, best to keep walking.\n\nIt could do with some added features, like being able to spend money to train your staff, or if you have a really good salesperson or manager who is quitting, being able to try and talk them out of it, if they're worth keeping around would be nice. Game could also do with some negotiation on car deals, though it seems the sales manager handles all that. Also missing is advertising budgeting.

You have to manage the optimal pricing to sell New and Used cars as well and manage your service department. For a fun little $5 game it holds its entertainment value. I look forward to some in game missions and other little things they seem to have in the works post release. I made an overview video of all the game aspects. For a simplistic tycoon game that gives you a chance each day to adjust your dealership I would say give it a go.

Its a great casual game as well, something you don't have to worry about spending a lot of time in but still be able to have fun.\n\nPros:\n-It's a neat game, fun, and one of a kind.\n-It's easy to play, not hard to understand and the mechanics are straight forward.\n-Cost: This game is just the right cost, worth the money.\n-It's not system intensive at all or space consuming.\n\nCons:\n-It lacks a sort of feeling, I can't quite place my finger on it but there's a hole in the game. It almost seems like it's lacking content.\n-It feels a bit like something you'd have on a tablet rather than a PC, although I enjoy the aspects this game brings it seems like it would be more suited to tablet format in its current state.\n\nUndecided Opinions:\n-For as small as this game is, it certainly has a lot of variety of vehicles, that said I can't help but think there could have been more. I didn't list this as a pro or a con because for the price its honestly a lot more than you'd expect.\n\nThings I Wish were in the game:\n-The ability to see your cars in your lot. Its something stupid I know but that sense of achievement of being able to see the cars drive off your lot as they're sold would be amazing.\n-The ability to set the price of the optional packages. IRL dealerships charge different prices for packages, it would be nice to see that as an option in the game.\n-Older Defunt Car Manufacturers/Older cars in general for the used cars and trade ins, I'd personally like to see oldsmobile or pontiac (Names changed accoridingly of course), among other things throw in older models of cars that are in the game, cars you can only get through trade ins or the auction.\n-The ability to see the condition of cars for trade ins, and the ability to see a bit of their condition from the auction.\n-Milage on used cars affecting price, or just adding milage in general.\n-The ability to have "Press Cars" or "Test Drive Cars" Where you can buy a car and designate it for test drives.\n\nThings I wish weren't in the game:\n-The dude in the white suit. That dude is just. . . He ruins CSR no matter what.\n-Everyone suddenly wanting the car you just sold out of.\n\nWhile this game lacks a few features that it could have, or perhaps should have had, its definitially worth the money.\n\nWould I reccomend it?\nYes, absolutely, if you love casual tycoon games this is the game for you. If you have a computer that isn't up to par and you're looking for a new game to play, this is also for you, This is more of a "Lets play for an hour" type of game, after a while it gets a bit repetative and boring but thats to be expected. Has it been boring for me? No, I absolutely love it thus far and will continue to.\n\nTL:DR\nLacks some features, but it's worth the $4.99 it for a casual tycoon game that you'll get fun out of.","November 9, 2015","true","15.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

I can honestly say I was wrong. The game overall isnt a bad game. Well worth the 5.00 price tag. Just takes some micro managing at the begining and getting past the the CSR loss. Once you get past that it's not that bad.  CSR is Customer Service Rating for those that havent played yet.  It is important as it determines the amount of folks that will come into your dealership regardless of foot traffic.\nIt is an issue in the beginning of the game but easily worked through. Just cant be looking for instant gratification is all. It will take a bit. I have now played the game through twice pretty much. Once to about 350 days and now I am at 280 days in game on this go around.\n\nTLDR: Game is worth the price tag.

There is room for improvements that other players have brought up but as it is now, it's pretty good. I started a dealership once to learn the basics then started a new dealership and have managed to expand a few times now.  It is worth the price I paid, no doubts on that and no regrets and the learning curve isn't hard at all, the mastering and manipulation to keep the dealership going is the real trick.  You buy and sell new/used cars and maintain a good parts supply for the shop making sure you keep the balance for the usual supply vs demand, do it right and you succed, mess up and you lose your customers and dealership.\n\nI like this because I can play for an hour or two a day thus allowing me to keep it going longer.\n\nI run a triple monitor PC system and while this runs fine on that I hope they add they ability to resize (resolution) in the future. I can go full screen or windowed with no problem so gameplay is not a problem.","October 30, 2015","true","41.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As of now the game is stable, but has a few flaws and some unpredictable randomness, and I have made some suggestions to the current game as it is, which I hope the dev will take on board. Of course the flaws and randomness add a challenge as it stands, but I have played far worse than this and would class the game as being in Beta rather than final release as the dev is still tweaking the game and adding new bits. Took me a few attempts to work out what I think the best way to play it to gain the most advantage, but if improvements are made to the random availabilty or hiring salespeople with a higher skill level (such as salespeople training) then that would make the game even more enjoyable.","October 31, 2015","true","24.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you're looking for a simple, short diversion and like tycoon games, you probably will like this.\n\nHowever, while it is a GREAT idea (especially considering how many crappy 'Tycoon' games there are out there), it under-delivers. I cannot disparage it for its $5 price tag - it's difficult to expect great things from a game that only costs five bucks. And yet, there's so much potential here that, if the devs stick with it and maybe add some more stuff to it, both under and over the hood, this could be a classic Tycoon title.\n\nAs it stands now, there's not much to it (again, I don't expect much for five bucks), and can be annoying at times. For example, your CSR will take a hit randomly, it seems. I can understand it dropping if you don't have a car in stock and a customer wants it, but otherwise it seems to just take hits randomly throughout the week, and I can't catch up. My CSR just keeps dropping and dropping from its 70 starting point to in the high 50s now.\n\nAlso, it's difficult to get ahead financially. I find myself having some good days with selling but if you have a good day selling, this means you're going to be out of cars, which means you have to buy a lot of them to replace those that sold, so your profit goes >poof< really fast. Margins are relatively thin, and that 'sweet spot' that the game talks about is elusive and seemingly random.\n\nI still recommend this game. It is unique and a nice little diversion. Don't expect a lot from it for your five dollars, and you'll probably enjoy it too. It would be good to see if the devs do more to develop this title.","October 25, 2015","true","0.7"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

In the state it is in, its a bit frustrating.  Has its fun points as well, just feel there is a lot to yet be done.\n\nProbably the biggest thing that bugs me, is the prices of the cars.  Obviously this is probably the biggest part fo the game!  To make this, not even so much like real life, but just better in general, what you sell a car for needs to be fixed.  The customer is never aware of what the dealer bought the car for, new or used, but it almost seems like in this, they do.  You can buy two of the same used car,  say one for $8,500.00, and the other you paid $7,700.00 for.  So now for the two cars, you dont have a listing that shows any difference in mileage, wear, or anything like that, so you should be able to set them both at say $10,000.00, making $1,500.00 on one and $2,300.00 on the other.  That is not how it works in this game however.  You will end up selling the $8,500.00 one for $8,600.00, and the other you will be able to sell for $8,200.00.  This makes it very hard to get anywhere in the game.  I understand you wont make thousands on every car you sell, but you should be able to sell a two cars for the same price reguardless of what you bought them for at auction or brand new!\n\nAnother part fo the game is the CSR....It is increadibly easy to loose point by point, but then it is incredibly hard to gain!  Sometimes it seems as if the game is playing against you.  Example: You have two of one brand new car, been on the lot for several turns/Days, you dont change the price, you dont nothing, all the sudden, the two you have get sold, and then everyone and their mother walking in your door is looking for that car.  And guess what, almost every person that is there looking for it, costs you CSR.  Since you can hardly make any money selling cars, it is very hard to upgrade your lot to be able to hold more cars that you cant afford to buy!\n\nI think they need to add that cars are damaged in some way, there are different mileages on them, all the things that make a used car a used car.  It would be nice to if they added a stat to the used cars on either the average bought/sold for price, or highest bought/sold and lowest bought/sold.  Helping you better know what to buy and what to pass on at auctions, as well as what to try to sell them for.\n\nOutside of the salesman, the techs, maybe ther service manager, what is the point of the other employees?  They seem like they do absolutly nothing.  you see no negotiating of prices(another thing that would make this game better), they dont set any prices... nothing.  What is the point of wasting money on them daily, if it seems there is absolutly no point to them?\n\nThere are other things as well that i think would make this game great, but these are the keys in my opinion.  In the current state it is in, i cant recommend this game.  If they every make any of these kinds of changes, i would absolutly change that opinion.","March 19","false","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's mediocre at its best. Fun to play at start, good concept, but just the execution is just rather dull.\n\nThe Good: Set you own prices for cars, Used car auctions are fun and realistic, Selling cars make you feel achieved.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Bad: Extremely difficult to make any sort of profit, challenges are difficult to achieve and the reward is pitiful, you're so focused on just restocking and hoping you'll sell your inventory with shear luck, CSR is extremely difficult to maintain especially in easy mode.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat Can be improved:\n-Motorcycles, buses/vans/trucks (Both Straight Truck and Tractor Trailer); Auto Dealership Tycoon is about automobiles correct? Yet I can only sell cars, I'm pretty disappointed in this aspect.\n-Tutorial; its mostly just reading pre-game screens without any examples.\n-More Upgrades\n\n\nFinal Verdict: For the price of 4.99 USD, its an okay game. Nothing that stands out and speaks "Wow this is a great price for a great game!" There are other games for this price you can get for this price or less. But its not a bad game to pass some time. Its something you can keep in your library.","October 27, 2015","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very easy to pick up on and not very complicated. Alot of the structure of is correct with automotive sales. The only issues I am having is I dont like the profit margins. I recently left my job as a car salesman to do follow a different career. I dont like that with used cars the profit margin is as low as it is. There are of course instances when you dont make much off of cars. In fact you make little to no money of new cars which the game has very accurately portrayed. However the structure of used cars is not very good. I think the new car structure is very accurate. Although, I believe the used car sructure is flawed. People tend to have trade-ins on their vehicles more times then not when it comes to purchasing a new car. I have not been able to keep a steady pace of trade-ins on any dealership I have created. Now I understand I have not put in as many hours as some of the people playing and some people may take that as me not knowing enough about the game. That is fine, but my knowledge with actual car sales is extensive.\n\nOverall the game could be fun for some people. It is accurate in many ways so other than the way used cars are collected, bought, and sold. That for me killed the feel of the game. I also dont think the game has enough content to keep me entertained. For people who dont mind a slow-paced tycoon game, this could be a decent buy for you. I personally will have to say that the game is just not for me.","May 23","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
