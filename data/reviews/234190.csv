The great first person shooter takes the handling of your guns unto a whole new level. This very realistic gunplay requires you to know how to handle your pistol knowing each and every step to perform an action. From changing the safety lock, emptying shells, and removing and reloading you magazine, all have their steps that wipes all the realistic shooters into the dust.\n\nBecause of this complex use of guns you will die a lot, pretty often actually. It takes time and effort to put to this game in order to complete. Everytime you die you’ll restart in the beginning of this randomly generated world. If you're not a person of patience then this is not the game for you. As you might start in different places on the map don’t expect to receive the same guns, same ammo, and other equipment like a flashlight. Those and as well as placed items are randomly generated.\n\nThe foes you face in this game are only robots, two kinds stationary sentries, and airborne ones which are equipped with a taser. The lack of variety of enemies can make this came quite boring for some. Knowing how to approach a corner when you hear the beep on a turret or the lights of a flying saucer can make fighting these guys very repetitive.\n\nThe dark, mostly enclosed setting in a tower gives this game a fighting like theme that fits the unknown exploration well. Learning how to conserve your bullets, finding a working flashlight, and collect these tapes that hold a mystery that involves all of mankind really makes it fun for me to play. As playing a easy game is never fun.\n","March 21, 2014","true","0.7"," 89 of 108 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","89","108","0","0"

Gun physics are AWESOME, the backstory is told through tapes which you risk your life to obtain, and the enemies scare the crap out of you, even though they really shouldn't. I love the aspect of the non-automatic reload systems, which this game does quite well. Want to reload your gun? Press at the very least 2 buttons multiple times to do so! Want to have enough magazines so that you don't die from having to reload the same one over and over again? Get the whole "remove mag, place in pouch, take out spare mag, place  in gun, release slide(if needed)" maneuver down! If you wanna play this game, beware that you will die. A lot. The two enemies do well in covering the randomly generated map, and when you encounter your first one, your trigger finger and aiming arm better be accurate! Locational damage plays a big part with your survival, hit a vital system on one of the two enemies and you'll be a happy camper. Er, Receiver. But hit some useless bit of metal, and you're gonna find yourself out of ammunition real soon.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenix_advance/recommended/234190/","phoenix_advance","phoenix_advance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenix_advance/","515 products in account","Receiver is one heck of a free game (was a giveaway). You are placed into a randomly generated texture-less world. Your objective is to collect tapes. You need to shoot or avoid sentry guns (there is only ground and air). It is a one hit kill’s type of FPS game, so it can be challenging.\n\nThe title of the game is somewhat of a pun and has no relation to weapon mechanics. As you collect tapes you hear a recording of a guy’s voice (sounds like Lone Wolf). He tells you the situation of what is going on. The story is freakish in the way that it gives meaning to the texture-less level with basic 3D models that you are strolling through. Each time you die and have to start again, the recordings are played in random order, which means eventually you may have a great understanding of the story even though you have not even made it halfway through the game.\n\nI’ll also quickly mention that the soundtrack also is very fitting and gives an atmosphere to the levels. It reminds me of Islamic prayer type of music sounds like in the film Black Hawk Down.\n\nThe most interesting part of the game is undoubtedly the weapon reload mechanics. The learning curve is not too steep in my opinion. It will help to just crouch down somewhere upon first play and fiddle with the buttons on your keyboard to understand how to reload your gun. There are two different reload mechanics to learn … the semi-automatic pistol (Glock and 1911 if I remember correctly) and the dirty harry revolver.\n\nIt is just cool. I find myself pulling back on the slide to eject the bullets which all go onto the ground. You pick up all the bullets which goes into a reserve (like your pocket). Then you need to put the bullets back into the magazine one by one, but you cannot do that before holstering your weapon (because you need two hands to fill a magazine). Then you need to draw and put the magazine back into the weapon. The first time you pull on the trigger, it may not shoot anything because you need to pull back on the slide again to load a bullet into the chamber. All this is an OCD persons dream come true.\n\nThe magnum revolver is a little simpler. Although you start to notice a difference when running low on bullets, you need to make sure you spin the cylinder to align the bullet filled chambers with the barrel. And because there is less bullets you are always having to pull on the ejector rod.\n\nWith all weapons you have a safety switch which is useless and you can pull back on the hammer for extra readiness. You can also turn on smart tooltips which highlight what you can and cannot do with button presses.\n\nI find the randomly generated levels made more sense compared to say Hellgate: London which did not make sense to me and felt more like a selling point gimmick. There are sections that you will familiarize yourself with. So even if the level is randomly generated, you know what to expect in each section anyways. So that is definitely a positive for a game that could have just been based on a single static level design.\n\nOne thing that I find stupid (and I am not 100% sure about this) is there may be a random luck factor when disabling sentries. It is actually the one thing that has really put me off the game. All sentries supposedly have these weak points. But if you shoot a sentry exactly at a weak point that disables it in one round and then try it again in another round, it will not work. And you can tell because when you get close to the sentry you can see where your bullets have hit exactly. Sometimes you can disable a sentry from a distance that looks like a pea on your screen with one bullet … sometimes you have to fire three shots at a sentry that fills up a quarter of your screen just to disable it. It makes no sense to me. I really hate luck factors in games.\n\nThe last thing I would like to mention is this game could have been great. I mean really big. But it is clearly unfinished and from what I heard was part of a competition in designing a game within a week. The thing this game lacks is arms, hands and textures applied to everything including the weapons. But seriously this game could have been amazing! I can actually visualise many FPS games that could utilize this mechanic. Tom Clancy type of games in particular, but even the Battlefield series. The reason why I mention this is because it is one of those revolutionary ideas that gets put out too quickly and is drowned by games with too common typical boring one button reload mechanics and nothing new (albeit finished). I really do hope to see something better made in the future with this idea … not everyone in the world just wants to gun down stuff on the screen senselessly. This is a needed option!","October 24, 2014","true","5.2"," 52 of 65 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","52","65","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RPINerd/recommended/234190/","RPINerd","RPINerd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RPINerd/","470 products in account","Receiver is a strange little title. I think if you've even heard of the game you know that it was the result of a game jam and was put together in a very short period of time (7 days I believe). These game jams have a knack for putting out some very intriguing concept pieces but understandably lack substance.\nIn a nutshell, this game is a rogue-like first person shooter with absurdly detailed gun mechanics. There is no “Press R to Reload”. First you must eject the magazine or spent casings, you need to reload with fresh ammunition bullet by bullet. Once you reinsert the clip, you can’t pull the trigger and expect a bang without loading one in the chamber and pulling back the hammer.\nWhile I would be outright lying if I tried to argue that Receiver had no lack of substance, the mechanics that are in place are undeniably engaging. My first few runs were rather frustrating but when I finally got a hang of the key mappings and how the different guns operate it was inexplicably rewarding. I felt extremely in touch with whatever gun I had been bestowed and more aware of my use of ammunition than I had ever been with any other FPS.\nThere is certainly no jaw dropping narrative or deep philosophical thesis on the blight of war buried within Receiver, but the depth in which the mechanics of firearms are explored here really shows the possibility of a seriously strategic and skill based first person shooter.","February 9, 2015","true","0.5"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","34","36","0","0"

So far it has too do with some kind of.. war that will happen.\n\nGameplay: Simple and bare with mechanics hardly found anywhere else.\nYou start in a abandoned building with a pistols which ranges from a Colt 1911 pistol, S&W Model 10 "Victory" revolver, and a Glock 10 with full auto mod. Everything is random, your ammo count, placement of ammo, and enemies.\nI should mention that ALL enemies make a sound and lights when they spot you. Therr are only two enemies in the game that I have seen.\n\nEnemy types:\nSentries: are stationary, but once they spot you, they fire at you as you would expect.\n\nDrones: These little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s chase after you once they spot you, choosing to close in at close range to taser you, I have yet to see with with a gun mounted on it.. or destory one.\n\nChallange: Think Dark Souls, but First Person Shooter with mechanics that fit more in a military sim. (Roughly)\n\nReplay ability: This one is a hard one for me, but it does get a bit tedious after a few tries. So it's doesn't have much replay value.\n\n\nVerdict: 8/10 With deep mechanics with the weapon types and detail of how it works.

One game I started with no ammunition - at all - and in a hallway guarded by a sentry gun. I couldn't run past it, and I couldn't shoot it - I had no ammo. It brought a quick death. I'm not against random aspects to a game, but there has to be boundaries. Randomly give me between five and fifty bullets.

It gives you full control over weapon operations - you can release the magazine, insert/remove bullets, release the slide lock, toggle the safety, and even use full auto - and it lets you see real gun mechanics at work. It may seem mundane to some but you'll soon find that reloading and operating a virtual firearm becomes mechanical as you play through and is quite satisfying - and it's a lot more interesting than simply pressing R to reload.\n\nThe game itself is surprisingly tense and suspenseful. Because your opposition (turrets and flying stun-drones) can kill you in one hit, you are forced to be practical and careful in your movements and actions. And, as you DO have a task in the game - of collecting 11 cassette tapes that are lying around in various places in the randomly generated world - it's a lot more challenging than you might think!\n\nAll in all - it's an interesting experiment in realism and definitely worth checking out.","June 14, 2013","true","9.7"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","23","30","0","2"

The primary focus is on mastering gun control. This includes ejecting the magazine, filling it with bullets, replacing the magazine, engaging the slide, and turning off the safety so it's ready to fire. It takes some getting used to, but it's not that difficult after a little practice.\n\nThe game part ends up being a permadeath environment where you search for and collect audio tapes while trying to avoid being shot by randomly placed turrets and flying drones. The player spawns with one of three guns that may or may not be ready to fire, a random number of bullets and magazines, and sometimes a flashlight. The one aspect that makes this game engaging is that you always have to be aware of your gun state, especially how many bullets you have in your magazine before you decide to engage a target. Ammunition is scarce making shots that much more valuable. The turrets and drones are quite tough which, combined with the weapon control elements, makes for some very cautious gameplay.\n\nMake no mistake, Receiver is certainly rough around the edges. The environment isn't randomized; only the enemies and audio tape locations. The graphics are not interesting, nor optimized. It feels laggy at times. It can even unfairly spawn you with no gear or in a bad spot. However, it does master the element of weapon handling. It can become quite intense if your magazine runs dry while a drone is hunting you down and you need to pull off a precision reload in the moment. And for that aspect, I give it a thumbs up.","October 3, 2014","true","3.9"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","21","29","0","0"

This would be fine and all, if exploring mechanics did not mean having a horrible atmosphere, incredibly strange controls, and a very unpolished feel.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the guns are good. But there's only 2 of them. I understand that this was originally created for a 7-day game challenge, but I believe Wolfire could have worked on this a bit more to make it complete (oh, and updates are halted indefinately until Overgrowth, which has been in development for 4+ years, is out).\n\nThe environments are randomly generated but you will see the same rooms put carelessly next to eachother over and over again. And I know that there are some things that can be considered the "art style" but almost every room has the same bland, unfinished texture for both the floor and walls. What gives?\n\nFinally there are the controls. It would be nice to really explore gun mechanics if I was able to use them easily. For Christ's sake, there are 2 different buttons to take out the magazine and put it back in. If you get back in the game after a break, you're going to have no clue what in the world you're doing, so you'll mercilessly slap your keyboard and memorize controls that should just be common sense.\n\nThere are also 2 types of enemies. One is a turret and the other is some sort of flying robot that doesn't detect half of your shots and sometimes gives the impression that it is disabled when it really isn't.\n\nIt's bland, it's boring, it's unresponsive, it makes no sense, and it won't change for a while.","December 27, 2013","false","3.2"," 35 of 57 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","35","57","0","2"

Rather than your standard run and gun gameplay most FPS features, Receiver is much more deliberate where the focus isn't just on the shooting, but also on the gun itself.\n\nIn Receiver you must manage every part of the gun, the slider, the hammer, the magazine, it's chamber, etc. If you don't take care of your gun, or understand how each part functions you will die... a lot. The game does a good job at simulating what it takes to handle a real gun. Due to it's vast amount of controls there is a definite learning curve with this game. It will not play like other FPSs you've played previously.\n\nThe game is only $5usd, which isn't asking for a lot, but do know there are limited amounts of options, features, and content. There is only one play mode, only 2 types of enemies, and not much in the way of customization. Although the game does it's best to incentivize reply with it's procedurally generated maps, enemies, and load out, and each play through will be different from the last, but it will be "different" with a lot of very familiar assets.\n\nCertainly the game is challenging, and at first may even be frustrating to some, but it's also very rewarding. Once you manage to get over the difficulty and control hump, the game will feel like none other you've played. Each kill feels like a huge victory, and the game does a good job at instilling a legitimate sense of tension and danger around every corner.\n\nOverall Receiver is a quality product at a low price point. The content might be limited, but through the creativity of it's mechanics, there are also endless possibilities to play through.\n\nPros:\n- Procedurally generated maps and load out offers endless play potential\n- Very unique mechanics and concept\n- Best gun simulation I've played (only gun simulation I've played?)\n- Challenging\n- Very fair price\n\nCons:\n- Limited content\n- Moderate visuals\n- Large learning curve","January 10, 2015","true","3.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The sales pitch is quick to warn upfront, almost apologetically, that the game is critically underdeveloped. While this may help temper user expectations, it doesn't excuse fundamental design flaws.\n\nThe game embraces a "monkeys and typewriters" philosophy of level design, placing the items and enemies in each playthrough entirely at random. In practice, this flavors the gameplay with a sort of anti-design. You will search chains of seemingly empty rooms only to learn that they were indeed empty. You will find the game's rare collectible items lying unprotected in the middle of your path. You will risk your life and dip into your scarce ammunition supply to defeat fierce groups of enemies, only to discover that they were guarding nothing. And when you die, the level is discarded - along with all of the effort you wasted exploring it. The game's antagonist shifts from the killer robots to the secret behind-the-scenes dice rolling machine. I've never felt burned out playing a video game so quickly.\n\nIf the authors had created and playtested a small set of predesigned enemy/item layouts rather than spend time developing the procedural generation system, the pacing and fun of the gameplay experience would improve tenfold. Players would face a consistent, fair set of challenges with steadily increasing difficulty and a way to mentally benchmark how their skills progress. Beating the game would become a well-defined and measurable goal instead of a tedious series of gambles. In fact, such a game could in all likelihood fly straight to the top of my favorites. Unfortunately, that's not the direction the developers chose.\n\nIf the simulation aspect interests you above all else, Receiver may be worth the buy. But judging it as a video game, the procedural generator drags the gameplay down so heavily that I can't recommend it.","May 14","false","5.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

Minimalist, beautiful, hard, mesmeric. Utterly recommended.\n\n----\n\nNow more detail: Receiver is a minimalist and realistic FPS. The game features 3 different models of guns: a S&W Model 10, a Colt M1911, or a Glock 17. It also features procedural levels (generated from patterns), and randomized placement for enemies (of which I've seen two different types, so far), items and objectives. That way, you never get the same experience twice. In addition, you spawn with a random selection of items, which can make the game difficulty range from moderately easy to very hard, depending on what you get.\n\nThe idea behind the game is to be as close to a realistic gun handling experience as it is possible with a keyboard and mouse. It means that the game maps to the keyboard/mouse a lot more interactions with the gun than existing titles, and also, does so with much greater details than usual FPSes. In addition, the difference in the power of each gun is very noticable, making the experience feel even more authentic.\n\nA must have.","December 25, 2014","true","8.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

But all I can say is "GET THIS GAME"\n\nnow as for the firearms, stated earlier I am a firearms collector and had some pretty interesting addition ideas.\n\n1: Polish P63 Makarov\n\nThe P63 is a polish knock off makarov that fires the standard Makarov 9x18mm cartrage, it's slightly less powerful then a glock, but it's very slim, has an excellent sight picture, and is not prone to jamming.   It can make for an excellent concieled carry firearm and is readily available on the market for 150 dollars.\n\n2: Hi-Point .40 S&W\n\nHi-Point is another company for people on a budget, but what they build really hits a mark.  The .40 S&W cartrage is a mix between a .45 and 10mm, giving you the power of a .45 and the accuricy/mag count of a 10mm.  Why a high point?  Because we should all give some oddball guns some love.\n\n3:  Mauser C96 Broomhandle\n\nThis would be a good fully/semi automatic model to add to the game for a few reasons:\n1: it's gorgous\n2: It's full auto and semi auto\n3:It uses a stripper clip, and I feel you should add some of the more awkward loading mechanisms to the game\n4: It's gorgous... need I say more?\n\nPlease consider these firearms.  They are all very easy to use and maintain, making it less of a pain on the user to fire them.

Tis a weird little game with a bunch of cool features. Aight, we're gonna hafta split this up into pieces.\n\nSTORY: The story of Receiver is similar to the first Hotline Miami in that the exposition is delivered in cutscenes in the form of various cassette tapes you find and have to play to finish the game. The story is that you are a Receiver, a survivor of the Mindkill event, an event that wipes the life off of the world you're on. Done by machines who had begun controlling the world, you are tasked to find all 11 cassette tapes and ascent to The World Not Filled With Turrets and Flying Tasers all the while dealing with the fact said machines are dropping in sentry guns and taser drones that can both drop your ♥♥♥ in 1 hit.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Gameplay in Receiver is the most interesting. It is similar to realistic shooters such as say Red Orchestra 2, Project Reality and so on. You get one of three guns, a Colt M1911A1, A S&W Model 10 "Victory" revolver and a modified Glock 17 each with their own specialties, the Glock can fire in full auto, the Model 10 can be fired in single and double action and so on and so forth. Also different in Receiver is that you have to do many things via key presses, ranging from loading individual rounds into gun magazines, releasing slides, using the ejector rod in the Model 10 and so on. It seems complex at the beginning but become almost instictive after an hour or two.\n\nENEMIES: As I said earlier, the enemies in the game are very basic, one is a sentry turret, the other a drone with a taser, or the ATF Special. Both of these are different as if you shoot specific parts of them, they do more damage. You can disable sentries by either shooting the CPU off to break it, disable it's battery or break the camera. As for the tazer bots, shoot it repeatedly, cause they're more annoying than the tazers in PAYDAY 2.\n\nIS IT WORTH IT?: The gameplay is rather solid and the gunplay is fun as well as realistic, and it sits at a nice $5 dollars. If you feel like spending $5 dollars on a small FPS then go ahead, if not, wait for a sale and nab it for cheaper.","August 23, 2015","true","5.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You will hate it and love it at the same time.\nYou play an unnamed protagonist navigating through various indoor and outdoor areas in a structure located in an unnamed city. Many of the rooms are guarded by randomly-placed sentry turrets that shot you on sight, or helicopter/taser sentries that fly at you when you are detected.\n\nYou come armed with one of three different handguns, all of which are nicely-rendered. Each one is operated in a realistic-manner that may be off--putting to the gamer used to relading by simply pressing the R key. In this game, reloading could involve five distinctly-different operations, depending on the gun you happen to have on you at the time.  The sound effects of the guns are nice, and have an authentic feel to them.\n\nThe environments you travel around in are randomly assembled, and comprised of flat-shaded textures and occasional lights. The assembly of the rooms means that you occasionally find passages to nowhere, but that doesn't really detract from gameplay. Repetition is high, and some of the rooms/areas are confusing, but since you are just passing through, it's not really a big deal. Your goal is to locate ammo and tapes, and the threats are there to stop you.\n\nAudio is pretty good, with a couple of notable exceptions:\n1: the helicopter sentries are loud enough to be heard from one room over, but it becomes difficult to pin down their locations based on the audio alone.\n\n2: The sentry turrets also make sounds while they rotate, but you can't hear them until you're almost right on top of them. Their sounds, as well as the helicopters,  also pass through walls/floors at the same volume level. This aspect of the game is bothersome if you are searching a room. I prefer to play the game with the music silenced so I can try to hear the threats before they spot me, and often I find that I am shot dead before ever hearing the servo motor of the turret that nailed me.\n\n3: The audio tapes are well-voiced, but remind me a lot of the sort of thing you might find on a webiste run by fringe-science/conspiracy theorists. After playing for a few hours, I completly silenced the tapes because I became bothered at having to hear them over and over again. Kudos to the devs for allowing this option in the settings.\n\nThe main goal of the game is to find all 11 tapes, and "absorb" them by listening. Listening occurs while you continue exploring, so that's a good thing. I did find a couple of small problems with the exploration/survival aspect:\n\n1: Sometimes the game allows you to access an area that does not have an exit. The only option is to exit and restart.\n2: You are assigned a random firearm and random loadout upon starting. Rarely, you will find yourself without enough ammo to eliminate enough of the threats to be able to find more.\n3: (Extremely rare) you begin the game in the direct line of site of a threat, and get killed immediately.\n\n\nFor a game created in a week as part of a contest, the developers have done an admirable job! The simplicity of the design and the addictiveness of the concept keeps me coming back over and over again.

One of the tightest FPS experiences I've everplayed.\n\nPremise of the game is simple--you're dumped into a kind of 'dream world', and you need to recover a series of tapes to 'wake up' (think The Matrix meets Videodrome meets Vanilla Sky. Or something.)\n\nYou're moving through a series of what are, apparently, interconnected apartment buildings, each with multiple floors that connect across. There are enemies scattered throughout, but only two types: flying kill drones, and turrets. Kill drones will fly straight for you and electrocute you at close range, turrets will shoot a spray of bullets at you from afar.\n\nSo far, so generic, and a lot less content than most FPS. So why play?\n\nWell, what makes the game work so well are the detailed mechanics.\n\nFirst off, if you're struck even once, or fall, that's it--you're dead. Going gun blazing into a room is pretty much game over.\n\nSecond, you control every mechanic of your gun with a separate keyboard key. Just arming and firing your weapon will take you a few playthroughs to learn, but when you do--it's amazing how rewarding your actions feel.\n\nThird, running requires that you 'tap' the forward key, lending a neat kinetic element to the game.\n\nFourth, ammo is scarce, and you'll have to selectively choose which fights you want to engage in... and which to bypass or run for it.\n\nDespite the sparse world and somewhat rudimentary graphics, sound design and aesthetics are brilliant, and I haven't been so kinetically into a game since the days of Atari 2600. Bravo!\n\nIt's hard to explain the culmination of all of the above elements; you'll simply have to try it out for yourself. It's unlike any oher FPS and revolutionary at what it does. I guess I would call Receiver the 'thinking man's shooter'.\n\nIt's terrific; buy it, then go yell at the devs to show it a little love and update it rather than spending all their time making rabbit-fighting games.","July 21, 2013","true","30.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The amount of rounds a player carries shows up as a number in the interface, and reloading requires nothing more than tapping a button. Actually handling and managing the bullets that go into a gun is a complex task, however. Receiver, an first-person shooter (FPS) from Wolfire Games, wants to remind us of that fact. Unfortunately, it never makes it clear why we should care.\n\nReceiver drops the player into a randomly-generated set of rooftop rooms and tasks him with recovering 11 tapes of droning narration (without subtitles) and that explain the game's story. The player begins with an unpredictable loadout including one handgun in one of various states and some ammunition. The player may also start with a flashlight or, if his gun is semi-automatic, a spare magazine or two. He must then move through the multi-tiered linear world looking for the tapes, which can be frustrating since one can go through at least nine rooms in a row without encountering a single one. I myself haven't managed to get all 11 in a single playthrough before dying.\n\nThe game only has two kinds of enemies: a stationary gun turret and a flying drone, both of which can kill the player with a single hit. Each has some associated visual cues, but most of the time the player will need to hear their alert chirps to know when he's been spotted and when it's safe to move. The distribution of enemies changes, and on rare occasions they can be avoided. Because enemies are difficult to evade and pickups can be hard to see, however, killing everything in a room is generally the only option.\n\nReceiver started as a response to a seven-day FPS challenge and definitely feels like it, from its spare graphics to its room-entry stutter. The hook for the game is that it presents the process of actually reloading the firearm in a significant level of detail. The HUD has no ammo count, and bullets do not magically fly from the corpses of your enemies into magazines the player can swap out every time he takes a breath. Rounds must be gathered manually and loaded into magazines by hand, with the gun safely tucked away. If there's no spare magazine, the player has to eject the empty, refill it, then shove it back home again. The only way to know the number of bullets remaining is to remember how many have been fired or check by eye.\n\nReceiver fails to establish that the complexity of gun handling matters. The detailed reloading scheme doesn't speak to the story, the aesthetic, or the other mechanics. Receiver doesn't treat aiming or shooting the weapon with the same carefulness it reserves for reloading, and doesn't fiddle much with the basics of movement, yet running and shooting are the core verbs of the game. By making the world randomly generated, the developers give up the opportunity to design encounters where efficient reloading matters. As a consequence, becoming more skilled with the game's most intricate systems doesn't make a player any more likely to succeed. Receiver's complex gun-handling mechanics are irrelevant in the context of its larger design.\n\nThat's a shame, because the larger design has nothing to recommend it. The perfunctory story and low-poly world of Receiver aren't interesting to explore in their own right, much less when one must overcome the game's unforgiving difficulty. The choice to generate the world randomly might add replay value, but it also adds much to the frustration level while costing the game the ability to present rewarding encounters that highlight its unique mechanics. Receiver has a neat idea at its core, but that didn't translate into an interesting game.\n\nFinal Score:  3.5\n4 /10","September 30, 2014","false","10.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After every engagement, you will check your gun and your ammo and make sure you don't spend the last free moments of your miserable existence frantically trying to load bullets in a clip while a hovedrone closes in for the kill on your enormous head.\n\nYou are also going to fail, a lot.  But many of you like that, and it can be very satisfying to clear half a level only to fail in a hail of gun fire or miss that ledge for those precious shiny bullets.\n\n\nThis game was developed for the 7 day FPS challenge and is the most streamlined experience for the FPS genre I have ever played. I have never beaten it, and I will never care. It is the thrill of dropping a hover drone from beyond its range, the joy in disabling a turret in a single shot, the chill of creeping into a new area and seeing the blue grid shine out from its sensors.\n\nThis is a gameplay experienced refined to its purity.  I would enjoy an open world survival game based on these gunporn mechanics, if it played as smooth as this.","April 15","true","11.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

Your weapon and ammo is also random, sometimes you can have a 9mm pistoll with 3 full clips, other times you can have a revolver with 5 bullets.\n\nEach piece of the gun has its own button, so if you want to reload your revolveryou need to open it, then shake it down to take out the bullets, reload it bullet bullet by bullet and then closing it. Pistols in the other hand are faster to reload, but you need to reload the mags before using them, and to make it you have to put your gun out of your hands. This makes reloading be a pain in the ♥♥♥, rewarding and very tense at the same time, depends on the person.\n\nAlso, enemies which are only 2, can be damage in multiple ways, like the turrets which keeping scanning the map, you can shoot the camera and make it blind, you can shoot it's base and lock it facing one direction, or you can shoot the support of it and make it be facing the ground.\n\nIt's a fun litle game, if you want an fps with doesn't hold your hand in any way and make your bullets really count, you can take a few hours of enjoying out of it ^_^.","September 25, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Basically, it's handgun porn. It's repetitive, but once you learn the controls, you keep coming back despite the Dark Souls-like punishment for screwing up. Sometimes I've flicked the game on, promising to spend only a few minutes, and then I look at the clock later and discover that an entire hour has gone by. It's pretty good, with two exceptions.\n\n1: This guy is the weakest person alive. I mean, okay, getting shot once and you go down, that's fine, but I've jumped out of trees higher than the distance this guy will break his legs upon landing from.\n\n2: It runs very poorly. I'm not sure whether that's due to inefficient coding or whatnot, because we all know the circumstances by which this game came about, but I can hear my computer chugging away even on the lowest graphics settings, and the game stutters like a chipmunk on crack. Meanwhile, I can run The Witcher on its highest settings without so much as a drop in the framerate.\n\nHad this been pitched to me on paper, I would've said, "Go back and finish it, then we'll talk."

You will most likely assume that this guy is just like your typical shooters, but no. Sadly, it's not.\nReceiver is truly a gun simulator that will kick your ♥♥♥ so many times that you will get frustrated beyond belief. I sat hitting almost every single key on my keyboard only because I didn't know how to reload/switch magazine. It almost made me forget how to shoot. It requires a lot of memorizing, because you will need to know what each button does. When you have started to get a hold of the commands, there will be a lot of practicing. This game doesn't perform on easy mode, if anything, it is "realism mode".\nThe Glock and M1911 are the most complex guns so far. If anything, you should start out with the revolver. The easiest gun to get used to (that is until I found out how to reload...).\n\nWas this easy? F*** no! Was it fun? Surprisingly, yes.

Your weapon and ammo is also random, sometimes you can have a 9mm pistoll with 3 full clips, other times you can have a revolver with 5 bullets.\n\nEach piece of the gun has its own button, so if you want to reload your revolveryou need to open it, then shake it down to take out the bullets, reload it bullet bullet by bullet and then closing it. Pistols in the other hand are faster to reload, but you need to reload the mags before using them, and to make it you have to put your gun out of your hands. This makes reloading be a pain in the ♥♥♥, rewarding and very tense at the same time, depends on the person.\n\nAlso, enemies which are only 2, can be damage in multiple ways, like the turrets which keeping scanning the map, you can shoot the camera and make it blind, you can shoot it's base and lock it facing one direction, or you can shoot the support of it and make it be facing the ground.\n\nIt's a fun litle game, if you want an fps with doesn't hold your hand in any way and make your bullets really count, you can take a few hours of enjoying out of it ^_^.","September 25, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You might think.\nOkay. You are part of many more other Receivers that dead-dropped cassette tapes all over the place  and you have to pick them up because save the trees.  and you are tasked to listen to the tapes in an unordered fashion to uncover the truth of what happened.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are simple and complex at the same time. You are given 1 of 3 guns.\nThe guns in the game are:\n-Glock 18\n-Colt 1911\n-S&W Model 10 "Victory"\nThe tapes were NOT updated when the Glock and the S&W were added, so one of the tapes still considers your weapon to ALWAYS be the 1911.\nAll weapons have realistic ballistics. (AKA bullets fly and ricochet like IRL)\n\nAgain, you might be thinking "So what?"\nWell, I'll tell you what. You have to operate specific parts of the gun to be able to even fire a single bullet.\nOkay, it's not that complicated.\nFor example, the slide, slide release and hammer are different buttons that you have to press to use the gun.\nYou heard that right, kids. The old days of pressing 'R' to reload are over.\n\nAfter a while of figuring out the controls  and dropping all of your magazines  you then have to pick up tapes.\nYes, remember back at the start of the guide? TAPES. But to do that, you have to overcome...\nENEMIES\nThere are 2 enemy types in the game.  Both are referred to as 'killdrones' on the tapes.\n-Turret (Your ordinary stationary turret that swivels and shoots many bullets into you)\n-Stun Drone (Basically an automated helicopter with a very painful stun gun on it)\nThe catch is that the enemies all have very similar parts, in which way you are able to destroy them.\nFor example, you can put one bullet into the battery and have it dead, or shoot it's main weapon and risk missing and then getting shocked or/and shot.\n\nAfter you recover all of the tapes, you awaken. From what? When did you fall 'asleep'? Play the game and find out.\n\n8/10 Great storyline, great gameplay, OK visuals.","September 19, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Automated Turrets and Flying robots are trying to stop you from finding all audio cassettes.\n\nUsing the gun is pretty realistic, you will have to reload your ammo and check if you got a bullet in the chamber. Also ammo is very scarce and hitting targets is difficult. Failing to take out the turrets and/or robots quickly will result in a quick death, they will attack you with precision and you will die after one or two hits. Everytime you start a new game the map (and audio cassettes) are randomised so that adds to the replay value.\n\nFor a game that has been made in just 7 days, Receiver is a really good game. Obviously you should not expect a game that will enjoy you for many hours, but the time you spend with this game is well worth it.\n\n","October 24, 2014","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Instead of simply pressing "R" to reload a weapon, there is a specific key that is pressed for every step of the reloading process (Removing mag, adding bullets to mag, inserting mag, cocking weapon, etc.).\n- Your two enemies, Bots and Turrets, both have various hit boxes that, when shot, provide different effects. Turrets, For example, spin around in a circle scanning for the player, and if you fall inside of their sweeping scanner's view, they will fire on you. So shooting a turret in a certian spot may prevent it from spinning, but leave its gun fully operational, and able to shoot you if you walk in front of it; while shooting another location may leave the scanner untouched but render the gun itself useless.\n- 3 or 4 different guns to choose from that all have different mechanics, strategies, strengths, and weaknesses.\n- Maps are randomly generated.\n\nCons:\n- The game is very repetitive. As your goal is always the same: gather the tapes.\n- Graphics are awkwardly ugly\n- Lack of enemies/weapons\n- Slight learning curve for gun mechanics.\n\nOverall, keeping the $5 price tag in mind, I give this a 8/10. Honestly I would say it's worth grabbing for the $5 tag if you can get it.","January 10, 2015","true","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As such, the visually bare environment really suits it.  Much more would be less--the game is a work of art in its own right.  The premises and specifics of the storyline are New-Agey (and therefore pretentious, if not ridiculous), but they do provide a context for playing and winning the game.  The ending kinda sucks, but it's really about the journey.\n\nThe game is challenging.  Ammunition tends to be very limited, especially for the Colt 1911.  It only takes one shot to take you down, but depending upon your shot placement, several rounds may be required to take down a drone or turret.  Player character seems to have brittle bones disease.  If you fall or jump more than a few feet down, you will die. There are no checkpoints or saves. When you die, you have to start all over again in a new, "randomly" generated map, with a "random" loadout of equipment.   You will probably die numerous times before you actually finish the game.   Most of those times, you will probably feel stupid.  Other times, you will be completely out of ammunition, having started with little, having found little, having used what you had efficiently, and having died trying to get more.\n\nGame actually succeeded tricked me into listening to recordings of the same  of asinine drivel over and over again, while I thought I was having fun.  Would-be cult leaders and New-Age charlatans take note!\n\nI died once because I couldn't make the last step up a flight of stairs.  I tried to run-jump it, bounced backwards, landed at the bottom of the stairs, and died. -4 points for the stair bug.  +3 points for not making me feel like a ninja superhero.\n\nFor a cheap indie title: 9/10.\n\n\n","December 17, 2014","true","16.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

One, it uses the roguelike paradigm of repeated deaths in a randomized environment. Two, reloading firearms is made much more involved. Rather than the usual r to reload, you have a whole set of actions: remove the magazine, holster your gun, put a bullet in the magazine, take your gun back out, put the magazine back in the gun, undo the slide lock, switch out of automatic.\n\nTogether these combine in an interesting way. At first, to get anywhere you have to use the help feature, a set of most of your keybindings that highlights what you probably want to do at any given time - especially, what actions you'll have to take to get your gun ready to fire. However after a few hours of play this isn't really needed any more, you've figured it out. Dozens of short plays ending in death tend to do that. It's a nice manual quality; it feels like I've learned to fire a gun in the usual way, practice with my hands.\n\nThis was almost certainly intended by the game makers. The scarce plot serves as justification for the main goal, finding tapes to listen to in order for your character to become "awakened" to the true Gnostic reality, which has been obscured from humanity at large by the "Threat". One tape in particular tells the character that they have been mentally weakened by popular media for years, and that the tapes are only a small step. The only way to escape the destructive Threat influence is by finding all the tapes, _and listening to them repeatedly_ (a million times is the suggestion).\n\nThere's a minor suggestion that the player is themselves in a deeper layer of the Gnostic heap, only able to get these messages from true reality through fiction. Considering the gun learning process, and that you will listen to the tapes repeatedly over your playthroughs, the intent is I think clear.\n\nSo that's neat. Of course all games do this learning to some extent, but it's interesting to see it more or less explicitly mentioned, and applying to something more "real world" than laying out character stats or something. (At least, I think real guns work mostly like in Receiver? I haven't touched one in years...) Of course I'd prefer if the skills taught were something other than firearms but what can you do.\n\nThe game does have problems. The graphics are primitive and glitches are apparent; for example you can jump through the ceiling in a few areas. More importantly I think, the game is pretty small. It was made in a week or such like and the lack of content shows. There are a limited number of room layouts that are spliced together to form your environment and it gets repetitive, and there are only two types of enemies. There's a load time between some rooms, that freezes the game for a few seconds; the resulting disorientation has gotten me killed many times.\n\nIt's definitely worth the less-than-ten-bucks however.","February 1, 2014","true","28.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The plot of the game is you are what is known as a "receiver" and you exsist in what people call "Reality B." Receiver is known as a rouge game, meaning everytime you die, you take a new body, the rooms are connected in a different order, to top it all off, you start off with a new gun in a different state, maybe even a flashlight. The guns you could receive (no pun intended) in the game are either a Colt M1911A1, a Smith and Wesson Model 10, or a Glock 17 with a full auto mode. It tries to potray a "realistic gun" in a way (seeing how the graphics are pretty basic); you can manipulate every part of the gun, from safety to pulling the slide half way to check for a chambered bullet. The enemies are what the game calls Killdrones: An flying one with a stun gun on it, and a basic turret. What sucks about the game is how one hit means death. (Hex, Remember to write a transition between death and goal, -Hex.) The objective of the game is to "absorb" 11 tapes holding information about the world around you. Overall, it's a fun game and I think you should check it out.\n8.5/10","March 23, 2014","true","6.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Hello guys!\nWelcome to my strange review about this game, i sincerely liked a lot playing this.\nI know... a lot of people said that this game is crap, just because you don't have things to do like doing missions and things like that.\n\nYou are a "shadow" with a gun flying in the air and people would be like "What a hell i'm playing".\n\nSo, in this game you don't have to do a lot of things.\nYou have 3 guns that swaps randomly when you die.\nA 357. A 1911 And a Glock.\n\nYou have to get this tapes, that says some things about the story about the receivers.\nBut there's a lot of Turrets and Flying robots everywere around the map, so is not that easy to get all the tapes.\nIs pretty frustrating, but think about it.\n\nIs pretty simple!\n\nI mean, is not that hard to reload a gun, you have just to pull out the chamber and load it on your own.\nThey did that just for making the game more hard than the normal ones.\n\nYou know, i like games like this, because it reminds me old games, when you didin't have to think about what are you doing and what do you have to do.\n\nIt helps you a little, tells you what things you have to do when you reload, but the game don't say anything about the story behind it and the why you are shooting robots.\n\nI think the dev wanted to take us back to the old times, the fun times when you stayed at home, playing games on your couch with the controller, but now with the Keyboard and the Mouse!\n\nYeah, Yeah. I know.\nThe game is all poligonal and things like that.\nBut is been made in 7 Days.\nAnd it remembers a lot the old days in the 90s.\n\nAbout the price.\nI can say that is not pretty good, just because 5 bucks for this game i think is too much for the people that watched a lot of games at that price.\n\nIf you don't like games like this, don't spend 5 bucks on it, just wait for the sales and spend 1 dollar for it.\nIs pretty worth it, and i hope you will understand that this game can be very good if you think about it.\n\nIs not good for the people that likes FPS games, shooting everything and everyone you see.\nYou have to stay calm and relax for doing this and win, if you freak out, you die.\n\nAt the end, i suggest you to buy it in the sales.\n\nHave a good one!\n\nP.S. = You will die in just one shot, good luck.","September 28, 2014","true","34.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game itself focuses on detailed gun manipulation that turn the automated actions of reloading, swapping mags or just checking how much ammo you got left, into detailed keystrokes that can end in disaster if used wrong in a combat situation. This is a great basis to give the game a lot of replayability even though it only features 3 weapons and two types of enemies as, like in a good action puzzler, your precise timing and situational awarness are tested over and over again even if you played through it before. The randomized layout and placement of enemies and pickups further adds to the replaybility of the title.\n\nIf you are not turned down by perma-death and the inability to safe or load a gamestate and you have a soft spot for punishing first-person action combined with a fresh look at gun play, this might be the title for you.","April 8, 2015","true","3.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The controls are complex, but the game's help menu really helps ease you in. After a few deaths muscle memory will take over and you won't need it.\n\nIt's quite an empowering feeling when you get the drop on two drones and nail them both in two shots.

Pretty much the only thing lacking in it is jamming, but you're talking about the M1911A1, Glock, and a revolver. S&M Model 10 or something like that. .38 Spl.  Not a whole lot of jamming to be found there, however it does happen on the rare occasion. There are the scatter complaint I have about this game, but a lot of positive aspects to point out as well, let's start with them.\n\nFirst off; individual magazine, not an ammo pool. LOVE it! Ability to manually remove ammo from a magazine, or load ammo into a mag. That's a first for me in a videogame, and it's outstanding. Ability to activate safety on an M1911A1, love the realism, however it should NOT be able to be activated when the hammer is decocked. I own a Springfield Armory 2008 M1911A1 Mil Spec, and it cannot be put on safe unless it is cocked.\n\nSelect fire on Glock 18. Now I don't like that they chose the Glock 18 because it's very rare for gun owners to ever handle one, however at the same time I'm glad they implimented it; it's almost useless in full auto, wastes ammo faster than you can say 'yeehaw', and will do more missing than hitting on anything beyond 10m. That's good, it shows people realism. Many people love the G18 because "Full auto pistol! 1337!" No, full auto is pretty much useless on a pistol unless it's got a stock on it. Even then, it will still eat up ammo insanely fast. Keep it on semi auto, or you won't last very long. Ultimately, I think it would have been better if they chose Glock 17 or Glock 22 (.40 S&W), but I love that they at least made it realistic!\n\nYou can also go magazine +1 (M1911A1 has 7 round mags (Even though 8 round mags are more common nowadays but I digress) so you can have a full 7 round mag, +1 in the chamber making a total of 8. Or with Glock 18 with 17 round mag, have than +1 in the chamber and you have 18 rounds before having to reload!) It's also cool being able to spin the cylinder of that .38 revolver. Load just one round, spin it, and play Russian Roulette. Will you have a live round, or an empty chamber? :o\n\nI think now I'll touch on the bad aspects; as said, M1911A1 shouldn't be able to be on safe while hammer is cocked. Also, for some reason, when you have a full mag loaded, with the slide locked back, if you press the 'pull slide' button or whatever it's called, then a round will eject. If you choose the 'slide release' button or whatever it's called in the game, then you will simply chamber a round. Realistically, either should be able to be used without a live round leaping out of the chamber.\n\nI think that's about all I have to say about the game other than the obvious; obvious to just about anyone who played it anyways... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FLIERS! You'll see what I mean, they have to do something about them. SO annoying! Anyways, I hope they continue to develop this game, and come to include the ability to find more mags, use more firearms (More than one if you're lucky enough to find another firearm), ability to choose difficulty (I WANT TO PLAY WITHOUT THOSE DAMN FLIERS!), and if at all possible, please develop some rifles, as well as potential long distance shooting with adjustable sights!\n\nDon't stop now that you have a (Albeit kind of simple beyond the controls) revolutionary game made; keep going! Try making a more in depth story line! Character creater! Inventory! Weight management! Perhaps leveling up because I know from experience that it takes time and practice to become an accurate shot! How about long-term gaming? Hunger, thirst, oh and don't forget about different types of ammo! 9mm isn't much use when all you have is an M1911A1 and an SKS (Just throwing an idea out there for potential rifles/carbines that could be found!) :) To a bright future for this futuristically realistic game!

When you first jump into the game you'll find yourself armed with one of three different handguns, a variety of bullets and/or magazines, and, if you're lucky, a flashlight. This is one of the key features of Receiver - everything is random. Your loadout, the layout of the world, items in the world - just about everything is random in every playthrough (and trust me, you'll be playing through a lot). There's also perma-death - when you're shot (or tazed) by the automated turrets and shock-drones, you're down for the count and thrown into a new world with a new loadout head-first.\n\nBut even with these different mechanics, what makes Receiver all that interesting if you just get three guns and a flashlight? That would be the five or so different buttons needed to reload. In Receiver, you don't just hit 'R' to slap another mag in, you manually pull the empty magazine out with 'E', holster your gun with '~', slot any spare bullets you have into the magazine with 'Z', draw your gun again, hit 'Z' again to slam the magazine in, and hold 'R' for a second to chamber a round. There are a couple other buttons to do a few extra things, too, and each gun has it's own reloading mechanics (these controls being for the Colt 1911. There's a simpler S&W Revolver and Glock 17 available).\n\nWhile these controls sound unnecessarily clunky, and I can't say they're realistic, it adds a new horror to your gun going 'click' while an enemy is charging you. You don't wait a couple seconds for the gun to auto-reload - you have to keep a clear head and go through each step of the process. Which is why you end up respawning a lot, unless you pause for a minute and drill yourself in the reloading process. This is the key feature of the game, and much more interesting (not to mention satisfying) than it sounds. And, come on, the game's only five bucks without a sale, and if you pre-order Overgrowth (which is a great game) you get this for absolutely free. You (hopefully) won't regret it :P","January 24, 2014","true","26.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Basically, you walk around getting casette tapes where then a man narrates some gibberish, giving context to the scenario, a la Bioshock. But the difference here is that Receiver is trying to simulate using a gun via keyboard and mouse by forcing you to press something like four different keys just to eject the forking ammo. And while trying to listen to the tapes while walking around the single, randomly generated level, you'll probably get shot by a turret and die.\n\nSpeaking of the randomly generated level, it's aesthetically awkward. It' one kind of big level where you randomly respawn after dying so many times and you don't retain your tapes. So when the motion and visual detecting turrets gun you down over and over again, don't blame yourself.\n\n6.0/10","September 17, 2014","false","0.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

That was a damn good game.\n\nThe core concept of the game is, "What if using a gun in an FPS was as complicated a process as it is in real life?" and that boils down to each little part of the gun having it's own button associated with it. You don't just tap the R button and watch a cool little animation and then be on your way, you have to do all the little things required and in the right order as your situation dictates. At the start you will fumble around with the gun functions and may not even figure out how to shoot for quite a while. Then after a few minutes you may start to get the hang of it, albeit taking your time between shots. After a few hours of playing you will really get the hang of things and reloading will be like clockwork.\n\nEven the enemies, which are little robots, have a similar complexity to them. They don't just have an HP bar that empties out after a few shots. You have to hit them in very specific parts to disable certain functions of them until you can safely pass by. It's up to you to learn where your shots count the most for disabling them.\n\nThe world is rather bland, however, and consists of a bunch of randomly generated rooms in sequence. You will get very used to these room as there is very little variety between them. You will figure out pretty quickly where the ammo drops can be and where the robots can be placed in certain rooms. It's the only real flaw in the game.\n\nThe music is decent and gives a proper mood to the whole thing.\n\nOne odd thing to note about the game is that you have to go to a separate website to patch the game. Specifically here[forums.wolfire.com]. Otherwise the game run's very poorly I've heard. I've only played the game patched and it is recommended.\n\nIf you are someone who want's a score then I give the game 5 cassette tapes out 5.

I thought this was going to be a quick pick-up-and-play novelty, but instead I found a game with an extremely complex and deep gun mechanic.\n\nGood:\n\nThe main catch of Receiver is that it has some seriously detailed and realistic gun mechanics. You randomly start with one of three pistols, either a magnum pistol, a revolver, or an automatic handgun, in a random state with a random amount of bullets. The term 'check your weapon' seriously applies here. How many bullets are in the magazine? Is there a bullet in the chamber? Do I need to pull the slide back? Is the safety on? Is it in automatic? Each of these questions comes up each time you spawn and pick up your gun, and each function and action has a key you have to memorize.\n\nBut what really keeps getting me about this game is how creepy it is. You are, in essence, the only living thing in a randomly generated complex filled with cold robots. it is dark and almost eerie. I kept thinking to myself that this game would make an incredible horror game. This is what F.E.A.R. should have been. But, as is, it is overall very tense and does a good job of leaving a lasting impression despite being so simple in story and graphics.\n\nI should also mention this game is very difficult in a lot of ways. You will likely die fumbling around with your pistol and trying to remember the controls. You'll curse yourself for accidentally dropping your magazine when you are trying to reload it, or while you scramble for that perfectly good bullet you ejected from your gun on accident. But the feeling of mastering your pistol is truly a reward on its own. And that doesn't even include shooting things.\n\nEnemies are tough on that note. Robots don't die from just being shot a lot. Enemy bots have four vitals you can hit to kill or disable them: weapon, motor, battery, and camera. Precision is everything. One aimed pistol shot can render a robot useless, but madly firing at the main body will do nothing. Turrets will unleash a flurry of machinegun fire if they catch glimpse of you, and those shock drones are a whole lot faster than they look. And finally, you die in one hit, and must start over every time you are killed.\n\nBut its all good challenge, and while the complex appears to be nearly infinite, it is possible to learn the game, recognize certain consistent features, and fight off your attackers with deadly skill while you explore and search for tapes.\n\nSo, overall for the good, it has a deep gun mechanic with lots of nuances and details (which is rare that I actually like something like this), its a lot more challenging than it looks, and somehow manages to master the art of simple elegance and proficent story telling while still being very simplistic.\n\nBad:\n\nI really don't like some of the randomization. One time I started within easy view of a hover drone, and prompty got zapped before I could even check my gun out. Another time I started with only two bullets in my gun and nothing else. Often times I found myself going on forever; searching out the complex without finding any of the tapes for long periods of time. A little consistency and a safe zone to start with would have been nice.\n\nAlso, I have to say while this game is fun, I feel like it is also a game I will never be able to beat. The complex is absolutely huge. I sometimes would spend several minutes gunning down robots and trying to survive; only to die with not even one tape. A radar for the little things would have been nice. Or something more than just a shiny spot. Its fun to be able to just explore blindly and figure things out on your own, but only to an extent. This goes well past that extent and into the frustrating "I can't figure out how to beat this" zone.\n\nMaybe that's part of the challenge for some, but that's not really my thing as a casual gamer.\n\nAlso, you'll learn to hate the hover drones because of how derpy their movements are. It really looks like they are being held up by a string. They bob and wobble in the air like a balloon in the wind, and will bounce and flop all over the floors and walls whenever they try to charge you. Again, maybe that's part of the challenge, but those things really test the aim in a bad way.\n\nFinally, the game does tend to lag a bit in certain areas, which for a game where victory depends on quick reflexes and sharp aim, that is really just a killer. I hate to walk through a door, only to have a lag spike that leads me to getting shot by an enemy I couldn't see around the corner.\n\nSo, while the game is fun, I do feel like there were a few flaws in execution. The randomness would be fine if your task wasn't so tedious and the level so massive. Aspects that I felt like should be there to legitimately challenge me just kept rubbing off on me the wrong way.\n\nFinally, I will say that a way to choose which gun you start with would have been a fun feature, and I can't figure any reason why this had to be excluded.\n\nBut, overall, I don't think any of that dampened the experience I had enough for me to not recommend this.\n\nIts a good challenge and a bit of a mind teaser as far as the controls go. There's a lot of detail that is sure to please any gun enthusiast out there, or just anyone who wants a break from the usual FPS crazies out there. It may not be the most realistic gun simulator, but it does an excellent job at simulating the feel of real combat. It teaches you how precious a bullet really is, why aiming is so important, and how ridiculous all the other action games like Call of Duty really are when it comes to their gunplay. Its immersive, its intense, and its a whole lot of fun.\n\nIts a bit of an experiment that I'm sure won't please everyone, but the idea is solid and the feelings it established really caught me by surprise. At the very least, this game is sure to teach you why weapons training is so much more important than learning to pull the trigger. And for this price? I couldn't recommend it more.","March 3, 2014","true","11.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Most games provide you enough ammo to get the job done. Most games start you with the same equipment, in the same location on the map. Receiver is not most games.\n\nYou start with one of three weapons at a random location on the single, large map. The amount of ammo you have appears to be random, as does whether or not you have a flashlight or spare magazines. In a normal FPS, you'd start with a full clip and pressing "fire" would do just that. With Receiver, that would make you extremely lucky. The first thing to do is examine your weapon. Is it a revolver, a semi-automatic, or a machine pistol? Is it loaded? How full is the magazine? Is the safety on? Is it set to full auto? All of this matters.\n\nWhile this can sound tedious, the surprising thing about Receiver is that it works. The graphics are terrible, the sound and story are nothing to write home about, but the gameplay more than makes up for everything else. As frustrating as the first few rounds can be, it's extremely rewarding when you finally start to pick things up. You'll quickly learn to count your shots because you don't have an ammo counter. You'll quickly learn to take cover and look around corners because the enemies are lethal. Pretty soon checking your gun, loading your magazines when you get ammo and checking every corner for turrets will be second nature.","July 12, 2013","true","12.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The gameplay is not unlike the '-Shock' series, where you're looking for audio tapes whilst trying to avoid and/or get-the-drop-on drones and turrets. The real difference in Reciever is in the shooting/gun mechanics.\n\nThe gun you have in 'shooter' games is usually little more than a fancy finger that goes 'pew pew' wherever you're pointing it. In Reciever, your weapon is a very realistic *system* with which you must learn to interact, both successfully and quickly, in order to survive combat scenarios. This means knowing how many bullets you have in your clip, replacing a clip when you need to, not dropping bullets by accident as you're trying to refill a clip on the fly. All of this is in your direct control. No random dice-rolls... if you get caught with your pants down, it's on you.\n\nIt's that direct relation of personal skill and performance that really draws you in. You will die quickly, and often. But each time you load up the game, or 'respawn', the environment is shuffled randomly. Even the equipment you start with is randomized. No two games are the same. And with almost zero load time. Just get killed by a drone that you didn't know was there until it was too late? It's okay, you immediately find yourself in a totally different place with a new weapon(1 of 3 , that I've seen) to familiarize yourself with and the lessons you learned from your previous life still fresh in your memory... now go see how long you live this time!\n\nThis is a great game and I honestly think every person who's ever played a FPS before should play it. If for no other reason than to gain a little more respect for the weaponry that so many of us have grown to take for granted.\n\nIt's cheap. It's great.

You are a "Receiver", one of the very few people who are able to hear a voice inside different mysterious cassettes you find. You must find enough cassettes to "escape" MindKill.\nThis sound a lot like Matrix, and yes, it is something like that.\n\n-The unique gameplay mechanic of the game: It simulate a more realistic way to control a pistol. Specifically a Colt 1911 pistol, a S&W Model 10 "Victory" revolver, and a Glock 17.\nAt first it is VERY complicate to remember every single button to control succesfully a pistol, but with enough practice, you can master it.\n\n-The game offer you a very helpful guide which show you the action of each button. A huge plus in my opinion.\n\n-The whole game take place in one huge level. However all the rooms/places, bullets, cassettes, enemies and the pistol you using is random generated every single time. Something like a Rogue game in other words.\n\n-The feeling controlling successfully a gun by pushing the keys in the rights order, is unbelievable! Me neither believed it at first, but it is true!!!\n\n-The A.I of the enemies is very interesting, specifically the flying drone. One time a flying drone hit a wall while I was running to avoid it. The result was to get disfunctioning and the drone started flying around like a drunk! Hilarious!!!!\nOne another time I shoot a drone and fall down just only to discover when I approached it was still functioning and killed me!!! MotherF*cker!!!!\nThe same goes of course for the gun turrets you fight/avoid in the game.\n\n[Cons]\n\n-The whole game is only one level. That it. Nothing new to add or a New Game Plus mode.\n\n-Only two enemies types: The flying drones and the gun turrets. More enemies would made the game even better.\n\n-Very difficult start. Even if I said it is very enjoyable to master the pistols, you will "suffer" a little to play the game properly.\n\n-My main reason why I gave the game 9/10 stars:\nIf you enter a new room/place, suddenly the game freeze a little for an unknown reason. For this many times I died because gun turrets shot me while I was lagged entering a room....\n\n[Final Thought]\n\nBeing very Cheap on Steam right now, it is a must play just only for the unique experience is offer.\nIt have some problems, but I forgive them very easily.\nI hope for a better and bigger sequel in the future.\n\n9/10","March 20, 2014","true","8.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can take a bullet one out at a time and put it into your pocket for later storrage.The down side is you only find 1 bullet at a time instead of a whole box thats 16 bullets like in the other game.\n\nAnd the ravolutionary part of this video game is the abbility to be a peace ful citizen. if you dont want to use a gun you can put it into the corner of your face and dont shoot any thing.\n\nThe objective of the video game is to collect 20 video tapes VHS from the ground. When you get the tapes you can hear a nerd talk about the world peace or something stupid.

You can even engage the safety on the M1911A1 if you really want to!\n\nIt's also a great way to learn about how to properly handle and operate real life pistols and revolvers, as well.","October 18, 2013","true","19.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You play as a person known as a "reciever" who is equiped with only a handgun, and an audio cassete with with headphone, who must uncover the secrets about a corporation called Mindkill ( or Mindtech I can't remeber ) through a complex building full of kill drones. The game focuses gun handling mechanics which instead of pressing R to reaload, you need press multiple keys to take the clip out, putting it in your inventory, getting a loaded clip from your inventory, loading the gun up, and cocking it up. The controls aren't the only challenge though, once you get hit by bullets, or a taser from the killdrones, you die and have to start all over. To add up to the challenge the tapes, ammo, flashlights, and audio cassete tapes are scattered in new locations each time you spawn. The story unravels as you collect more tapes, each with a message revealing the secrets of Mindkill ( or Mindtech ). The sound and music makes walking around the building suspensfull, and makes you think that something around the corner is going to kill you.\nOverall this game is really fun, and is definetly worth getting if you want a great FPS, and a challenge.","November 27, 2013","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game is very basic on graphics, but its honestly a good game.\n\nReplayability is high as item spawns, enemies and the entire map are random each time. The story is very basic and once you've heard all the tapes the story is not exactly always refreshing.\n\nEven though there are only 3 weapons they cover all the basic means of handguns. The Revolver, the medium handgun, the light handgun and even the automatic (On the glock). it allows you to make strategies based on what you like the most, being that all guns have their own ups and downs. This is both in rate of fire, capacity and power. Accuracy and range aren't issues at all thay you'll deal with as the environments you'll be fighting in usually force you to be within 100 yards away from enemies.\n\nThe enemies are very basic, but they cover conventional standards; one can move and attack while the other one can shoot but not move.\n\n(and if your wondering why I only have 0.3 hours its because I took it off of my computer and played it at work)\n\nOverall rating: 8/10 Well worth the price.","March 3, 2014","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is by far its most fascinating--and fun!--feature.  It also sports a simple and unobtrusive soundtrack that, for me, draws me straight into this dark, simply rendered, rough-around-the-edges, strange, and wonderful place.\n\nThe controls take some getting used to, mostly because of the complex actions they are used to perform.  FPS veterans: forget everything you think you know about first person shooters for this one.  The panic that sets in at the disheartening *click click* of an empty chamber, unloaded magazine, or an uncocked hammer, as an enemy bears down on you, is wonderful and frightening.\n\nStill, not terribly long into my first session, I found myself, mostly through muscle memory, ejecting a magazine to peek at how many rounds I have left, loading it back into the gun, peeking in the chamber to make sure I have a round loaded, taking a deep breath, and rounding a corner to fire directly into the camera of a robotic sentry gun just as it "beeps" in hostile recognition, seconds from destroying me.  Only after the encounter was over did I realize I was completely on autopilot.\n\nReceiver is definitely the most unexpected, fascinating, and mechanically interesting game I have played in a long time.  It is breathtaking in its visceral simplicity.  It requires a certain sense of open minded wonder to fully appreciate, and it is certainly filled with flaws, both in terms of polish (it was made in 7 days for a competition) and in terms of its unusual game mechanics.  However, at $5 full price, it's a deep breath of fresh air, and I find myself wondering whether--and hoping--other shooters  will look to Receiver for inspiration.  I won't hold my breath.","May 18, 2014","true","10.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

Most notable is the gun mechanics, where you must go through all the motions of reloading your gun manually, from inserting bullets individually into magazines to pulling back the slide. If this sounds complicated, it is. However, the game is nice enough to provide a help overlay that shows you the next button you need to press. Eventually, like handling a real gun, doing every action will become muscle memory, and you'll no longer need the help screen.\n\nThe game has three different guns that you will get randomly when you spawn: a Colt 1911, a Smith & Western Victory Revolver, and a Glock. All three weapons handle differently. Probably the simplest to master is the Victory Revolver, as it is the least complicated to reload. The Cold and Glock are fairly similar in reloading and maintaining but are different enough to be noticeable. It would have been nice if there were more guns included, but it isn't a huge deal.\n\nThe 'story' of the game is pretty simple and only exists to give you a reason because it needs to. You must find 11 cassette tapes randomly strewn around the generated environment, avoiding a couple different types of automated enemies. The game is really challenging, and how far you get in the game seems to be based on luck (There have been many times where I've failed to find any tapes despite surviving for quite a while and other times I've found most of the tapes without running into too much resistance). The many times you die won't frustrate you too much, but will only drive you to try "one more time". Unfortunately, the level generation isn't really that interesting, and you will quickly become bored of the same rooms over and over again.\n\nAmmo is fairly limited, only spawning in random places, so you will need to make every shot count. Enemies have certain weak spots that are more suitable to damage. You can also disable certain parts of enemy robots by shooting them, such as motors or cameras, that disable those functions. For instance, destroying a flying "Killdrone"'s taser leaves it unable to damage you. The poor thing will continue to follow you around trying to zap you, like a lost puppy.\n\nThe dynamic lighting won't work on some computers with some medium or low end graphics cards, like mine. This causes many rooms to be too dark to explore properly. There is a flashlight item in the game that also does not work if the lighting is broken, making the purposefully-dark rooms very hard to navigate, but not impossible. It really frustrated me when I realized it, but eventually I got used to it.\n\nOverall, Receiver is a fun, challenging, and addictive game that I like to enjoy in short bursts, but lacks a lot of content. It's very realistic gun simulation compared to pretty much any other FPS out there.","November 25, 2013","true","5.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

If the developer could add the smell of gun powder and lubricant oil the game would be complete.\n\nThe game:\nAll the variables are randomized at each start. You will spawn with either of the 3 weapons available and the amount of magazines and bullets you spawn with is also randomized. Most of the stages offer more than 4 routes to get past and all of the enemies are spawned randomized.\nThe one thing to bare in mind though is that: The more bullets you find and carry, the more enemies will spawn in the next area. As a kind of progressive difficulty I guess.\n\nThe story is not that important as you are the receiver of audio tapes carrying an audio tape player. The tapes you find will progress the game and when you have collected 11 tapes, the game is complete. But don't expect to complete the game in the first playthrough.\n\nThe gun handling is the main concept of the game as each action bound to a button manipulates the gun in one specific way. There's no "R" to reload automatically and watch a prerecorded animation play that lasts 4 seconds, you are the one doing the heavy work.\nYou press one button to: Pull the slide back, eject the magazine, pull the slide catch down or up, activate safety, grab a magazine from your harness, etc.\nThe first hour of the game is probably a learning process but after that, the game is a lovely charming experience of gun porn. It will be satisfactory when you manage to do a speed reload in 2 seconds and shoot a bot coming towards you.\n\nAre there ways this game could be better?\nAbsolutely. It could use more textures, mipmapping, bumpmapping, atmospheric soundscapes and more stages and weapons but as a concept of gaming it is complete. I would love to see moouse gestures implemented as a means for the actions that have longer motions. Buttons like safety, slide catch, mag release and cylinder spin can still be button specific, but actions like pulling the slide and manipulating magazines and bullets could be mouse gestures. Hold CTRL to make the mouse button appear and start clicking and dragging.\n\nBut I'm not afraid that this is the last game with this concept as other games inspired by this is slowly appearing on Steam Greenlight as well as on the web.","December 27, 2013","true","19.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The pressure is on you--if you get hit even once, you're dead no matter what progress you've made. If you don't make your bullets count, you'll be hard-pressed to find more ammo.

It's kind of like a dating simulator in that you get a very rough approximation of the real thing but none of the real pleasure of it. Granted, it also comes to you very naturally if you have shot a real weapon. Also I've noticed people in the reviews complaining about the utter randomness in the game including enemies, bullets, gun you get and so forth but there's a very good reason for this and I see what the developer did here.\n\nOne of the first things that you're taught when instructed in shooting is how to check your chamber. It's important to learn because it's one of the main things you do to check if your weapon is safe or not and stops you from accidentally wasting a round. You also need to check a magazine in any gun regardless of whether or not anything is chambered. Basically it's random so you get into the routine of checking your weapon like you would in real life and it's an awesome way of pounding procedure into people's heads.\n\nOn another note you can also do a trick wherein you chamber a round, take the magazine out, then put another one in to get an extra one. In real life it's not very healthy for the magazine's spring and is one of the top 10 ways to literally shoot yourself in the foot but since this is a game go nuts.\n\n\nIn conclusion if you're okay with not having the actual feeling of the shot and getting to feel that pleasurable click of loading rounds and magazine insertion it's probably worth playing if you can get it cheaply. Though I'll personally probably never play it again after I get 11 tapes for the first time.\n\nEdit: Actually cancel that, I wasn't going to mention it but it has some performance issues despite the very simple untextured geometry. It also drives my GPU temperature through the roof because of the apparent load so I'll probably not play much more of it.","October 11, 2014","true","1.2"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

I thought this was going to be a quick pick-up-and-play novelty, but instead I found a game with an extremely complex and deep gun mechanic.\n\nGood:\n\nThe main catch of Receiver is that it has some seriously detailed and realistic gun mechanics. You randomly start with one of three pistols, either a magnum pistol, a revolver, or an automatic handgun, in a random state with a random amount of bullets. The term 'check your weapon' seriously applies here. How many bullets are in the magazine? Is there a bullet in the chamber? Do I need to pull the slide back? Is the safety on? Is it in automatic? Each of these questions comes up each time you spawn and pick up your gun, and each function and action has a key you have to memorize.\n\nBut what really keeps getting me about this game is how creepy it is. You are, in essence, the only living thing in a randomly generated complex filled with cold robots. it is dark and almost eerie. I kept thinking to myself that this game would make an incredible horror game. This is what F.E.A.R. should have been. But, as is, it is overall very tense and does a good job of leaving a lasting impression despite being so simple in story and graphics.\n\nI should also mention this game is very difficult in a lot of ways. You will likely die fumbling around with your pistol and trying to remember the controls. You'll curse yourself for accidentally dropping your magazine when you are trying to reload it, or while you scramble for that perfectly good bullet you ejected from your gun on accident. But the feeling of mastering your pistol is truly a reward on its own. And that doesn't even include shooting things.\n\nEnemies are tough on that note. Robots don't die from just being shot a lot. Enemy bots have four vitals you can hit to kill or disable them: weapon, motor, battery, and camera. Precision is everything. One aimed pistol shot can render a robot useless, but madly firing at the main body will do nothing. Turrets will unleash a flurry of machinegun fire if they catch glimpse of you, and those shock drones are a whole lot faster than they look. And finally, you die in one hit, and must start over every time you are killed.\n\nBut its all good challenge, and while the complex appears to be nearly infinite, it is possible to learn the game, recognize certain consistent features, and fight off your attackers with deadly skill while you explore and search for tapes.\n\nSo, overall for the good, it has a deep gun mechanic with lots of nuances and details (which is rare that I actually like something like this), its a lot more challenging than it looks, and somehow manages to master the art of simple elegance and proficent story telling while still being very simplistic.\n\nBad:\n\nI really don't like some of the randomization. One time I started within easy view of a hover drone, and prompty got zapped before I could even check my gun out. Another time I started with only two bullets in my gun and nothing else. Often times I found myself going on forever; searching out the complex without finding any of the tapes for long periods of time. A little consistency and a safe zone to start with would have been nice.\n\nAlso, I have to say while this game is fun, I feel like it is also a game I will never be able to beat. The complex is absolutely huge. I sometimes would spend several minutes gunning down robots and trying to survive; only to die with not even one tape. A radar for the little things would have been nice. Or something more than just a shiny spot. Its fun to be able to just explore blindly and figure things out on your own, but only to an extent. This goes well past that extent and into the frustrating "I can't figure out how to beat this" zone.\n\nMaybe that's part of the challenge for some, but that's not really my thing as a casual gamer.\n\nAlso, you'll learn to hate the hover drones because of how derpy their movements are. It really looks like they are being held up by a string. They bob and wobble in the air like a balloon in the wind, and will bounce and flop all over the floors and walls whenever they try to charge you. Again, maybe that's part of the challenge, but those things really test the aim in a bad way.\n\nFinally, the game does tend to lag a bit in certain areas, which for a game where victory depends on quick reflexes and sharp aim, that is really just a killer. I hate to walk through a door, only to have a lag spike that leads me to getting shot by an enemy I couldn't see around the corner.\n\nSo, while the game is fun, I do feel like there were a few flaws in execution. The randomness would be fine if your task wasn't so tedious and the level so massive. Aspects that I felt like should be there to legitimately challenge me just kept rubbing off on me the wrong way.\n\nFinally, I will say that a way to choose which gun you start with would have been a fun feature, and I can't figure any reason why this had to be excluded.\n\nBut, overall, I don't think any of that dampened the experience I had enough for me to not recommend this.\n\nIts a good challenge and a bit of a mind teaser as far as the controls go. There's a lot of detail that is sure to please any gun enthusiast out there, or just anyone who wants a break from the usual FPS crazies out there. It may not be the most realistic gun simulator, but it does an excellent job at simulating the feel of real combat. It teaches you how precious a bullet really is, why aiming is so important, and how ridiculous all the other action games like Call of Duty really are when it comes to their gunplay. Its immersive, its intense, and its a whole lot of fun.\n\nIts a bit of an experiment that I'm sure won't please everyone, but the idea is solid and the feelings it established really caught me by surprise. At the very least, this game is sure to teach you why weapons training is so much more important than learning to pull the trigger. And for this price? I couldn't recommend it more.","March 3, 2014","true","11.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'd spin around and empty 3-4 magazines trying to shoot 1 little drone buzzing around my head.\n\nEventually the game just started trolling and put 3 tapes and 5 turrets in a very small space.

This is understandable considering the very short dev. time, but it bears mentioning. For the most part, though, it's a very interesting game. Weapons handling is modeled in a way that no other game (that I'm aware of) has done. Instead of having a reload key, for example, the game has separate buttons to remove/insert magazines, pull the weapon's slide, pull back the hammer, etc. Once you get the hang of it, it makes for a really interesting, tactical experience using the game's weapons.\n\nThe game has a storyline told by finding 11 cassette tapes scattered around an environment that's randomly generated each time you play. Finding all 11 tapes requires a fair bit of exploration, and the random elements of the game give it decent replay-ability, even with only a few weapons and enemy types.\n\nOverall it's an engaging, atmospheric game, but I wouldn’t recommend spending $5 on it. In fact I wouldn’t recommend spending any amount of money on it. The controls are as confusing as ♥♥♥♥, and you die very easily, almost impossible without mods.

Your mission is to locate 11 tapes that are scattered around the map and listen to their dialogue while staying alive.

There are 3 guns total but how many bullets they have and whether they're loaded, cocked or with the safety on can vary between each start.\n\nOn the negative side, there are framerate hitches whenever you walk into new areas and the levels can get really dark. The flashlight proved more of a nuisance than help because it only lights up a few feet in front of you. This could mean life or death in this game. There are no gamma settings in the game. Also, as I mentioned previously, the levels can get a bit repetitive at times because they are seemingly different pre-made areas which are stitched together in different ways because of the level generator.\n\nAll in all, a very entertaining game.

You must learn how to manipulate every part of a weapon from pulling back the slide, ejecting the mag, and manually refilling cartridges.  What's usually simple, is suddenly a challenge in memory and nerves as you fumble to reload with death at your back.

I'd spin around and empty 3-4 magazines trying to shoot 1 little drone buzzing around my head.\n\nEventually the game just started trolling and put 3 tapes and 5 turrets in a very small space.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stragglerastic/recommended/234190/","stragglerastic","Lagg&","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stragglerastic/","292 products in account","It's pretty novel and fun but in the end if you've ever shot a real weapon it just makes you want to do that. It's kind of like a dating simulator in that you get a very rough approximation of the real thing but none of the real pleasure of it. Granted, it also comes to you very naturally if you have shot a real weapon. Also I've noticed people in the reviews complaining about the utter randomness in the game including enemies, bullets, gun you get and so forth but there's a very good reason for this and I see what the developer did here.\n\nOne of the first things that you're taught when instructed in shooting is how to check your chamber. It's important to learn because it's one of the main things you do to check if your weapon is safe or not and stops you from accidentally wasting a round. You also need to check a magazine in any gun regardless of whether or not anything is chambered. Basically it's random so you get into the routine of checking your weapon like you would in real life and it's an awesome way of pounding procedure into people's heads.\n\nOn another note you can also do a trick wherein you chamber a round, take the magazine out, then put another one in to get an extra one. In real life it's not very healthy for the magazine's spring and is one of the top 10 ways to literally shoot yourself in the foot but since this is a game go nuts.\n\n\nIn conclusion if you're okay with not having the actual feeling of the shot and getting to feel that pleasurable click of loading rounds and magazine insertion it's probably worth playing if you can get it cheaply. Though I'll personally probably never play it again after I get 11 tapes for the first time.\n\nEdit: Actually cancel that, I wasn't going to mention it but it has some performance issues despite the very simple untextured geometry. It also drives my GPU temperature through the roof because of the apparent load so I'll probably not play much more of it.","October 11, 2014","true","1.2"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ipquarx/recommended/234190/","Ipquarx","Ipquarx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ipquarx/","111 products in account","If you want the short n' quick of my review, here it is: It's an incredibly challenging game with an extremely well-made gun mechanic and great immersion, but it's poorly optimized and variety is limited.\n\nWhen I first picked up this game I had no idea what I was doing, and I think I quite enjoyed that at first, the first few deaths were absolutely laughable as I fumbled around with the controls manually looking up which button does what every time I needed to load another bullet or try to pick up a tape. The first thing you notice are that the graphics are mediocre at best, but in a game like this it really doesn't hurt the immersion factor one bit. The immersion is amazing, by the way. This game is an unintentional survival horror game. Enemies can and WILL scare the ♥♥♥♥ outta you.\n\nBut then after a little while I got a hang of the controls, and that's where things really picked up. After you start to get proficient at controlling the gun and even the more advanced mechanics of switching out whole mags quickly instead of just reloading a few bullets, the game gets immensely more involved. You're no longer concerned with just getting one or two tapes, you want them all. You want them bad, you've already spent several hours on this thing... So you start to learn the very well-implemented mechanics of localized damaging, where you need to hit a specific part of an enemy to take it out, and with as few bullets as possible. No CoD-style shooting at someones hands or legs to damage them.\n\nThe voice acting is not great, he fumbles around with words a bit and sometimes the sound clips a bit, but it doesn't matter because given the story it's totally reasonable for this. Story-wise: They might not have had enough time to record a super-fancy nice message. Development wise, they only had a week. Cut em' some slack.\n\nEventually, you get to the point where you've heard every tape a dozen times and seen every enemy almost every time, and you still may not have beaten the game because there are so many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tapes. At this point, there's a very real possibility that you could get tired of the game due to the lack of variety and extreme difficulty. But, if you persevere, and there's a good chance that you'll beat it, and oh boy... When you beat it, it's so satisfying. INCREDIBLY satisfying.\n\nOn top of all that there's actually a good bit of replay value thanks to the randomization of all the maps (Though it admittedly can ♥♥♥♥ you up someimtes and it's entirely possible to have an impossible-to-beat map) and even the modding community that has managed to add in a bunch of different stuff to make the game play better.\n\nSo to recap!\n\nPros:\n+ Great gun mechanics\n+ Accurate gun and bullet physics\n+ Randomization of structures item locations\n+ Reasonable learning curve\n+ Amazing immersion\n+ Very satisfying to finally beat\n+ Good replay value\n+ Great modding community\n\nCons:\n- Very poor textures even on highest settings\n- Poor optimization due to engine limitations\n- Only 2 gun types by default\n- Only 2 types of enemies\n- Borderline extreme difficulty to get all 11 tapes (At least for me),\nmeaning it can take a long time to beat with a lot of potential frustration.\n- Randomization can ♥♥♥♥ you over\n\nOverall I would definitely recommend this game. It's an impressive and fun to play twist on the FPS genre made in only a week.","May 14, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

It takes the FPS genre to a much higher level of realism. It has no difficulty settings, checkpoints, game save or HUD for that matter.\nYou start the game in a random room inside of a building.

Equipped with a 1 of 3 diferent firearms (a Glock 18, a Revolver or a 1911 45. cal Pistol), a flashlight(that you may not get on spawn but be able to find later), and nothing else than that you must find out what is going on.\nWhen walking around the building you will find  turrets or flying robots that will try to kill you. You can fight or run, but in some areas you will just have to go trough them to progress.\nYou will eventually find orange sound tapes that will tell you why you´re there, how to get out, and how to effectively fight the robots and turrets.

This is understandable considering the very short dev. time, but it bears mentioning. For the most part, though, it's a very interesting game. Weapons handling is modeled in a way that no other game (that I'm aware of) has done. Instead of having a reload key, for example, the game has separate buttons to remove/insert magazines, pull the weapon's slide, pull back the hammer, etc. Once you get the hang of it, it makes for a really interesting, tactical experience using the game's weapons.\n\nThe game has a storyline told by finding 11 cassette tapes scattered around an environment that's randomly generated each time you play. Finding all 11 tapes requires a fair bit of exploration, and the random elements of the game give it decent replay-ability, even with only a few weapons and enemy types.\n\nOverall it's an engaging, atmospheric game, but I wouldn’t recommend spending $5 on it. In fact I wouldn’t recommend spending any amount of money on it. The controls are as confusing as ♥♥♥♥, and you die very easily, almost impossible without mods.

It's the same reason flight sims can be tedious when played on a keyboard.\n\nFor a game made in a short amount of time, sure, it's not bad. But that's about it.","March 26, 2014","false","0.2"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

It takes the FPS genre to a much higher level of realism. It has no difficulty settings, checkpoints, game save or HUD for that matter.\nYou start the game in a random room inside of a building. You don´t know who you are or why you´re there. Equipped with a 1 of 3 diferent firearms (a Glock 18, a Revolver or a 1911 45. cal Pistol), a flashlight(that you may not get on spawn but be able to find later), and nothing else than that you must find out what is going on.\nWhen walking around the building you will find  turrets or flying robots that will try to kill you. You can fight or run, but in some areas you will just have to go trough them to progress.\nYou will eventually find orange sound tapes that will tell you why you´re there, how to get out, and how to effectively fight the robots and turrets. In order to finish the game you must find all 11 tapes scattered around the building.\n\nThe game mechanics will be hard to understand at 1st, but in time you will get better at it. And if you don´t like some of the controls you can change them from the Launch Menu.\nYou don´t have sights in the screen so you must aim to shoot properly, there are many commands for what you can do with your weapon, and the reload process must be done manually.\nAmmo is in pretty short supply, so you got to look around in the building and find bullets, equip it in your magazine (or barrel) and put in your inventory(in case you are using a pistol), then have it ready to reload in combat.\n\nAlso this game is made with the Unity engine, so don´t expect anything fancy here.","September 28, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is worth $1. I understand it was made for a FPS 7-day competiton thing, but if you're gonna bother to put it on Steam and sell it for 5 DOLLARS, at least put some extra effort and improve it. Maybe have 2 versions, the improved and the original. Also, I can barely run it. There is nothing going on and the game looks like ♥♥♥ yet I am running at 20 FPS with low settings. Optimzation is didn't come to mind when putting this on Steam. Anyway, the concept is good and mechanics work but the difficulty is ridiculously hard.

The first thing you notice are that the graphics are mediocre at best, but in a game like this it really doesn't hurt the immersion factor one bit. The immersion is amazing, by the way. This game is an unintentional survival horror game. Enemies can and WILL scare the ♥♥♥♥ outta you.\n\nBut then after a little while I got a hang of the controls, and that's where things really picked up. After you start to get proficient at controlling the gun and even the more advanced mechanics of switching out whole mags quickly instead of just reloading a few bullets, the game gets immensely more involved. You're no longer concerned with just getting one or two tapes, you want them all. You want them bad, you've already spent several hours on this thing... So you start to learn the very well-implemented mechanics of localized damaging, where you need to hit a specific part of an enemy to take it out, and with as few bullets as possible. No CoD-style shooting at someones hands or legs to damage them.\n\nThe voice acting is not great, he fumbles around with words a bit and sometimes the sound clips a bit, but it doesn't matter because given the story it's totally reasonable for this. Story-wise: They might not have had enough time to record a super-fancy nice message. Development wise, they only had a week. Cut em' some slack.\n\nEventually, you get to the point where you've heard every tape a dozen times and seen every enemy almost every time, and you still may not have beaten the game because there are so many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tapes. At this point, there's a very real possibility that you could get tired of the game due to the lack of variety and extreme difficulty. But, if you persevere, and there's a good chance that you'll beat it, and oh boy... When you beat it, it's so satisfying. INCREDIBLY satisfying.\n\nOn top of all that there's actually a good bit of replay value thanks to the randomization of all the maps (Though it admittedly can ♥♥♥♥ you up someimtes and it's entirely possible to have an impossible-to-beat map) and even the modding community that has managed to add in a bunch of different stuff to make the game play better.\n\nSo to recap!\n\nPros:\n+ Great gun mechanics\n+ Accurate gun and bullet physics\n+ Randomization of structures item locations\n+ Reasonable learning curve\n+ Amazing immersion\n+ Very satisfying to finally beat\n+ Good replay value\n+ Great modding community\n\nCons:\n- Very poor textures even on highest settings\n- Poor optimization due to engine limitations\n- Only 2 gun types by default\n- Only 2 types of enemies\n- Borderline extreme difficulty to get all 11 tapes (At least for me),\nmeaning it can take a long time to beat with a lot of potential frustration.\n- Randomization can ♥♥♥♥ you over\n\nOverall I would definitely recommend this game. It's an impressive and fun to play twist on the FPS genre made in only a week.","May 14, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

The detail extends to the physics engine itself, with accurate balistics, and even the enemy turrets and hoverbots, which can be partially or completely disabled depending on the area they were shot in.\n\nAt first, the controls will feel quite clunky, almost like the QWOP equivalent of shooters (which was a design intention on behalf of the developers), but eventually you develop a routine for prepping your weapon. Then the game messes up your routine in panicking moments, as a hoverbot BEEPS and rushes to taze you to death.\n\nIt's a game made in 7 days, so there's bound to be several glitches and optimisation issues, but if you can look past those it's an enjoyable experience, also doubling as a way to learn a thing or two about weapons in general.","June 4, 2015","true","14.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Nothing beats the feeling of learning the gun mechanics and successfully using them against the (sadly) 2 types of enemies you'll face during the game.\n\nThe map is randomly generated for each playthrough and each time you die but things will definitely start to look familiar the more you play. Your mission is to locate 11 tapes that are scattered around the map and listen to their dialogue while staying alive. Be very careful while turning each corner in this game because a single enemy shot will kill you and send you back to the beginning. Oh and did I mention the guns are also randomized? There are 3 guns total but how many bullets they have and whether they're loaded, cocked or with the safety on can vary between each start.\n\nOn the negative side, there are framerate hitches whenever you walk into new areas and the levels can get really dark. The flashlight proved more of a nuisance than help because it only lights up a few feet in front of you. This could mean life or death in this game. There are no gamma settings in the game. Also, as I mentioned previously, the levels can get a bit repetitive at times because they are seemingly different pre-made areas which are stitched together in different ways because of the level generator.\n\nAll in all, a very entertaining game. Definitely get this on a sale. The adrenaline rush and realistic gun handling are definitely worth quite a few hours of random fun.","July 28, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The gun system is by the most interesting part of this game, and the main selling point of it: There is no "Press R to reload" in this game, ammo doesn't magicly appear in your clip.. Heck, you might not even have an extra mag, meaning reloading requires you to go through the effort of putting in each bullet into the mag, provided you even have some bullets stored away.\n\nReally, I wish more games had such a deep gun system, where you have to manually reload the realistic way instead of just pressing R and making a new magazine poof into the gun. however, it is a shame that such a system is wasted here...\n\nWhile it is fun to fiddle with a gun in this game, what holds it back is how the game is played.. The goal of the game is to collect a certain number of tapes while fighting off robotic sentries in a randomly generated series of buildings. However, what this quickly boils into is a game that is nothing but pure luck if you win or not. The world is so randomly generated that it is possible that it could spawn an impossible situation that makes the game unwinnable.. Other times, however, it might just give you all the tapes right near the start, although this is rare.. From what I heard, it isn't worth it, though.\n\nSo what about the combat? Surely it must be fun. And it is, provided you only are fighting ground-based sentries. But the moment you come across a flyer, kiss your progress goodbye because the blimy little robotic dinks will kill you so fast it baffles the mind. You will tremble in fear the moment you hear their buzzing down the hallway, maybe even try and find another way around, because no matter how hard you try, you can't beat them.. Not without either getting insanely lucky or throwing half your ammo at it.\n\nThis is because of how crazed their movement is, the flyers flying in such a wobbly way that it makes it hard to hit them, let alone once they start charging you.. They shake so hard that it is like staring at a very angry blur. This makes it very hard to hit weakpoints, and the fact that they are melee based makes it worse, since you have no way of protecting yourself against the speedy hunks of junk unless you run like a bat out of hell and get lucky enough to avoid them. Wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the one-hit death system.\n\nCombine random generation with such unfair enemies and you get a game that oftentime, no matter how hard you may try, you will never be able to beat. Not because it is hard, but because the game tends to play unfair, sometimes going the extra mile to make sure you suffer your fair share of cheap deaths. A shame, really.. Were it not for the bullish systems in place, this game woulda been great.. But alas it is held back by some real unfun flaws.","October 31, 2014","false","6.9"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","14","29","0","0"

I like the idea of a game where you actually have to go through all the motions of maintaining your weapon, e.g. opening the chamber, extracting the empty casings, loading the new bullets, closing the chamber, pulling the hammer, etc. There is something tactile about it that is very satisfying.\n\nThe thing that really kills it for me, though, is that the different styles of gun lead to completely different control schemes. Sometimes equipping the flashlight is the 2 key, but sometimes it is the 1 key. In one round, tapping Z causes you to load more bullets into the empty chambers you're examining, but in the next round, pressing Z will make you drop the clip you're examining onto the ground (even if it's full). There are too many buttons doing too many things as it is, but then when the game shifts them around on you every round, it only compounds the problem. Those who are patient enough to go through the pain of memorizing all this may not have a bad time, but it is a major hurdle to the enjoyment of the game.\n\nThe point at which I quit the game though was when I loaded a new round and the randomization placed me inside a room with a flying turret directly behind me. Literally, the round started, I heard a gunshot, and the round was over. I know roguelikes are super into busting the player's balls with randomization, but that seemed a bit steep.\n\nIn short, I love the idea, but I don't think I like the execution.","December 13, 2015","false","0.4"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","14","29","0","0"

I can't remember how I ended up getting it on Steam--I had it before I had a Steam account and I didn't like it then either. But I decided after reinstalling it that I would try playing it to see if I could get good at it.\n\nIt was made in like 24 hours so it's perfectly excusable that I can't recommend it. But things like rendering shouldn't be a problem for most players of a game. I don't have much trouble with other, more complex games with textures and stuff that my computer actually has to load as it goes. Unless I reduce the resolution to like 560x480 or something ludicrously tiny like that, this game is completely unplayable because of the lag (a common complaint, it seems).\n\nAside from that, this game is not intuitive in the slightest. It looks like I'm definitely not the only person who has had incredible amounts of trouble just figuring out how to load my handgun. Again, this is excusable because it was made in so little time. If you're a diehard fan of guns and roguelikes, have uncanny powers of patience and fantastic eyesight, maybe watch a trailer or something and see if you think you would like it. Personally, I would not pay anything for a sequel unless it was a fully-developed and crafted game.","September 12, 2014","false","0.5"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","13","27","0","0"

The storyline is short and not compelling, the game doesn't run or look particularly well at all, and the gunplay is unique, but not enough to hold my interest.\n\nThe story is told through audiotapes found randomly throughout the game. I found it rather uninteresting, which in part is to be expected as the primary objective of the developer was to experiment with gunplay mechanics. As a result we have a storyline that just gives you a reason to collect audiotapes and shoot guns at robots.\n\nThe game did not run particularly well for me, and I doubt it’s a problem with my hardware. Clipping and pop-ins are fairly common. The environment is not textured so anything other than the guns you use look bland. The backdrop of a metropolis was a nice touch but overall the game was unimpressive graphically and technically.\n\nThe gameplay is centered on the gunplay. You are given a random gun in a random condition with a random amount of ammo. You can manipulate nearly any aspect of the gun including pulling the hammer back or loading bullets individually into a magazine, and each action requires a different key. It takes time to learn, but once you start to figure it out it becomes increasingly satisfying to quickly empty the casings out of a revolver and reload it. You fight two types of enemies, a flying taser robot and a turret. Different parts of the enemies react in different ways when shot, so accuracy is rewarded over speed. For example the strategy I usually attempted to employ was to shoot the camera on the turrets as ideally it would take one bullet, and they would no longer be able to detect me. Admittedly the gunplay is interesting, but in the end I don't think it’s capable of holding up the whole package.\n\nWithout a worthwhile story and weak graphics, the gameplay fails to make this game worth the $5.00 price tag. I'm glad someone experimented with gunplay to make this game, and if you can pick it up for a cheaper price or free, it is worth trying. Gun enthusiasts should also reconsider what I have said, because this game might be something you will find quite enjoyable.\n\n","January 19, 2015","false","1.6"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","2"

Everything about the game is in need of polish, from an awful UI (for such an extremely sparse UI as it is), to intentionally poor control layout, to the combination of these factors exacerbating its brutal difficulty. It's impressive how such a simple game can fail on so many levels.\n\nThe game is brutal in it's difficulty. Not because the enemies can kill you with a single hit, or that they greatly outnumber you, or that you have very limited ammo, or that it's intentionally difficult to aim your weapon properly, or that some enemies appear to be able to absorb prodigious amounts of ammo for little to no good reason. No, the biggest difficulty creator is the fact that there is no rhyme or reason to the control layout beyond the normal movement and aiming and firing controls. Yes, the game is supposed to have a difficult mechanic of maintaining your weapon. But the button placements make no sense - they neither emulate the firearm that you are using, nor are they set up in a way that encourages a logical pattern. They're just generally clustered around the WASD keys like the developer just slapped them down whenever he thought of a new feature that guns have that he had yet to implement.\n\nThe only hook into the plot (what little plot there appears be) is from audio tapes that have a poor voice over that you may or may not find near the beginning of your adventure. There is nothing that will make you feel like you have a need to complete the plot, other than any intrinsic desire you may still harbor for completing the game for the sake of completion alone.\n\nAlso, a very special frustration that I managed to encounter is the fact that the game offers no way to reset one's controls to the defaults, but the UI that gives you control hints entirely works on having the default controls. So if you change your controls you'll either need to give up on using the tutorial UI, or find them online (at the time I write this I was incapable of finding them listed), or delete your registry keys from Windows so the game is forced into returning your defaults to you.\n\nThe only people who should buy this game are the heedlessly masochistic and the curious game developers who want to explore the concept and how not to approach it. Even then, wait until it's on sale.","October 9, 2013","false","0.9"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

You engage at your own pace* taking short bursts of high risk. "High risk" can be as mundane as turning a corner. If you don't see the telltale spotlights, robots shoot you and you die instantly. Situational awareness is sacrosanct and there are no non-diegetic distractions. It manages to be tense, and then routine, which causes laziness and then death. The high lethality, immobile enemies, and detailed gun manipulation emphasize readiness. To get ready, there's lots to do. There's nothing like being ready to go with a robot around the corner, magazines topped off, safety off, ironsights up, and dying because you forgot to chamber a round. The game does suspense very well.\n\nYou start completely over when you die. You collect random pickups for your random gun around randomly placed enemies in random structures**. There are "plot" tapes to collect but you won't realistically collect them all ever. Some are blank. It's neat how nakedly cultlike they are. Like a real-life cult, not videogame-standard delusional idiots. Mystical ideas have materialist labels. The speaker in the tapes is a gun-and-apocalypse obsessed cult leader. He says they're magical superpower-granting tapes. You have to listen to all of them a ridiculous number of times (it's meta, you will hear the same ones over and over.) Your gun holster and pouch and loose ammo is standard kit. It's almost what the Branch Davidians would sound like if they did their propaganda mail-order.\n\nUltimately though, it's not very good. It's kind of ugly. It's badly optimized, and lags when generating a new area. There's hardly any content. The lighting is obviously wrong in places. Some of the procedural areas don't "line up" and connect right. One map area has stairs with an invisible ledge you have to jump over. If you jump on a bed your head clips through the ceiling. The environment can clip through your inventory. It's possible to get physically stuck where it's impossible to get out or die. There are a ton of tapes and sometimes the random number generator is just unfair. The game has a lot of problems. It's an extremely unrefined version of a neat idea***, so I wouldn't recommend it to most people. It's only five bucks and I'm not most people, so it worked out for me.\n\n*I died at spawn once because a robot spawned in an adjacent area in line of sight.\n**Technically procedurally random but who cares.\n***Because it literally is, it took a week to make.","August 24, 2014","false","15.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

While not inherently "bad"... Receiver isn't a game that will be enjoyed or appreciated by most people; that is why I'm giving it the down vote, to be honest I don't recommend or recommend-against playing this game, I simply didn't find it enjoyable.\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  You there! collect all the tapes! "who me? Why do I want to do that?" That's what I want to ask, but I'm not given that luxury. I collected only a couple tapes before getting tired of being murdered by the turrets 10+ times. Presumably you are collecting these tapes to uncover a mystery within the game and to understand what's going on inside the game.\n\nGame Play: First thing you do: Press ? on your keyboard so you can see what to do\nSecond thing you do: go through an acurete and realistic weapon arming proccess\nthird thing you do: run around and collect stuff on the floor\nfourth thing you do: run into your first enemy and get yourself killed\nGoal: To collect 11 tapes\n\nThe highlight for this game are the gun handling mechanics, you don't simply press "R" to reload, depending on the weapon you're using you need to press a button to change the cartage and then press a button to load a new one.\nFor the revolver, you actually need to open the revolver, take out the old bullets, and put in new ones. While very interesting, and highly realistic, the game is not very easy to learn and will require learning new tricks if you want to actually survive the game play.\nI took down several of the auto turrets, there seem to be two kinds: Flying, and stationary. Both of them are really annoying if they spot you. If you get seen, you have a second to dodge around the corner. My instincts to shoot back usually ended up getting me killed.\n\nAchievements: No achievements (thankfully), unless you want to make them for yourself, I think collecting 11 tapes would be quite the accomplishment.\n\nPrice:  This game just ended up in my steam game library, so free is free, but the price is $4.99 on the steam page. Probably not worth it for most people.\n\nConclusion: I realize this game was made for the "7-day FPS challenge" which is why the graphics and the environment is very basic. But I just didn't really enjoy the game play, if there was more story, or just something to keep me interested I'd probably enjoy it more.\nThis game would appeal to people who want to see what a game would be like with more realistic gun mechanics, however after playing it, I see why these types of mechanics aren't implemented in traditional shooters; because it breaks up the action within the game.","January 8, 2015","false","0.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

It is actually more beneficial to avoid most of the enemies than to actually shoot at them with your gun.

I really wanted to like this game, I really did, but there is a major problem with it. This game is sooooooo poorly optimized it is nearly unplayable. According to the store page, my PC not only met the Minimum requirements, but the Recommended requrements (barely but still) yet the game had UNBEARABLE framerate and mouse lag. I  mean it takes almost 2 seconds for the gun to move after you move the mouse. Sure, what's 2 seconds? Well in a game where you have enemies that are flying quickly, turrets that can kill you almost immediately after spotting you and limited ammo to hit small targets on previously stated enemies... yeah the mouse lag can really be a problem. It wouldn't bother me if the requirements of my PC aren't powerful enough, but I have read the requirements and they match (so don't blame my crappy Computer that [supposedly] meets the requirements).\n\nNow onto the actual game... there isn't much. The game is very simple. Collect all the Cassette Tapes around the level, while killing off all enemies and trying to survive. The main feature is the realistic gun unloading/reloading mechanics. Everytime you need to reload or whatever, you need to manually pull back slide, take out magazine, store in inventory, take new magazine out of inventory, load new magazine, unlock slide, and pull back hammer before being able to fire your gun. Each step has its own corresponding key to hit and it overall is annoying. It loses its novelty very quickly and just makes reloading a chore. It also makes it impossible in a firefight. Also each of the three different weapons has different reloading sequences... great.\n\nAlso levels are randomly generated after death. So once you die, cassete location, enemy location and type, bullet count, flashlight batterey life, and gun type all change. This gives the challenge and overall is annoying since enemies (who instakill I should add) can be right around any corner. Also bullets are in random spots so good luck finding them when you have ran out and are now running from your life against flying guys in a hallway that has a turret around the corner at the end of it. What should happen is instead of the levels randomize after death, have a randomize button so you can know the layout and actually finish a level.\n\nOverall, the game has a cool idea but the poor optimization and annoying instakill enemies with tiny weakpoints ruin a game that could have had some really tense atmosphere.","March 13, 2014","false","0.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The story in the tapes you collect ingame is mildly interesting, but not great. There's very little music, and it's nothing special. The level is really basic, boring, and overly minimalistic. Visuals are generally kinda ugly, without much style too. There's only two types of enemies, and while the idea of hitting them in specific locations is a cool idea, it's really tough in practice. The turrets aren't too hard to hit (there's a bit of a challenge, but not too much) or in some cases just to avoid, but the flying drones are nearly impossible to hit in the critical spots, and can require more than one hit, despite them flying extremely erratically. Combat can be frustrating, and not in a way that made me feel skilled for dispatching an enemy, so much as glad I wasn't hit myself. After almost two hours of trying to enjoy this game, I realized my hope was futile. The idea and core gunplay of a game is there, but nothing else of substance. Oh! I almost forgot the worst offence!

Like, really about guns. The main attraction of this game is how it handles gunplay so realistically. Rather than have you automatically reload, you have to manually do each step to reload. If you miss up, there's just more time for flying sentries or turrets to get you. The point of the game is to traverse a randomly generated maze of bleak colors to find cassette tapes that provide background to the universe.\n\nThe game's atmosphere is wonderfully dark and creepy. It does a great job of making you feel alone, and the dark colors combined with the low-quality models and textures create a sense of dread and otherness that makes you really feel like you're out of your element, running through a maze you have no map of that's filled with enemies that are more location-savvy than you.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and rewarding. When you first start, you're probably gonna be really slow at handling your gun. You'll die a lot, and you'll forget certain steps, completely halting any progress in loading a new magazine into your weapon, typically under enemy fire. You won't have much ammo, and will have to conserve your bullets, though eventually you will run out right before entering a room full of enemies. As you get better at the game, you'll be able to load your gun faster and be more precise with your shots, wasting less ammo. This game does a good job of making you feel like you are progressing at the game because it is solely skill-based.\n\nI'd buy it.","September 11, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Like, really about guns. The main attraction of this game is how it handles gunplay so realistically. Rather than have you automatically reload, you have to manually do each step to reload. If you miss up, there's just more time for flying sentries or turrets to get you. The point of the game is to traverse a randomly generated maze of bleak colors to find cassette tapes that provide background to the universe.\n\nThe game's atmosphere is wonderfully dark and creepy. It does a great job of making you feel alone, and the dark colors combined with the low-quality models and textures create a sense of dread and otherness that makes you really feel like you're out of your element, running through a maze you have no map of that's filled with enemies that are more location-savvy than you.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and rewarding. When you first start, you're probably gonna be really slow at handling your gun. You'll die a lot, and you'll forget certain steps, completely halting any progress in loading a new magazine into your weapon, typically under enemy fire. You won't have much ammo, and will have to conserve your bullets, though eventually you will run out right before entering a room full of enemies. As you get better at the game, you'll be able to load your gun faster and be more precise with your shots, wasting less ammo. This game does a good job of making you feel like you are progressing at the game because it is solely skill-based.\n\nI'd buy it.","September 11, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There is no presented objective, and you are fighting little helicopter drone things that just appear and zap you.\nWaste of time, really.  If you want realistic gun action, just go out to the range and fire off a few.\nThe controls are FAR from intuitive, there is NO tutorial, and you cannot view or rebind keys in-game.  The FOV is tiny both horizontally and vertically, and the environment is boring.  The music, while indeed creating tension, is repetitive and just gets on your nerves after a couple of minutes.\n\nSeriously, if you want realistic firearms action, just get a cheap .22 and get out of the house, take a safety class, go to the range, and squeeze off a few.

It seems that this game was more of a tech demo than anything. Other than the "Tron" sounding background music, this game really doesn't provide any emotional connection with the player. The game simply starts... there is no story provided, other than the players having some sort of idea that they are running along some rooftops looking for cassette tapes. I assume these tapes give some sort of minimalistic story. I get the point that this was made for some 7-day FPS challenge, but they could have at least given the player some sort of story or motivation to find these tapes. The graphics are incredibly minimalistic, yet it runs poorly on my laptop, even on the "fastest" setting. I get much better performance playing something like Dragon Age or FInal Fantasy 13 than I would on this game. When I turned the resolution down to the lowest setting (like 600x800 or so), I got decent performance. You might as well do this, because you won't lose any graphical details... because there are none to lose. I believe this to be either a hardware compatability problem or simply not programmed well to run efficiently.\n\n---PROS---\n+Minimalistic/Non-existent story (if you like that sort of thing)\n+Tron music\n+Very "realistic" process of having to load and reload a gun.\n\n---CONS---\n-Minimalistic/Non-existent story\n-No Tron motorcycles or discs\n-You have to press way too many buttons to load a gun. There is no tutorial or simple explanation other than pressing the "?" button for help, and blindly pressing the buttons until your gun is ready to shoot.\n-Graphics are very minimalistic (AKA- Didn't have time to add detail)\n-The game runs extremely poor on a dual core laptop with 8GB ram.\n-For the average game player, I think the gun loading process is extremely cumbersome... At least make a tutorial or arrange the buttons in a streamlined order.\n\n---CONCLUSION---\nIf you like randomly generated worlds in games with no story, as well as tron music and hard to load guns, this is the game for you. For the rest of us, we'll be better off playing something else.","March 31, 2015","false","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But the basic gameplay elements, controls, are rarely if never before seen. I have not encountered a game that makes you actually manipulate a firearm in the ways this game makes you. You are forced to load a magazine manually, load the mag into the gun, turn the safety off, rack the slide, then you can commence the shooting. Which is unweildy and hard to remember during high stress situations just like with real guns.\n\nIts a shame the gameplay is crap and it runs so poorly on my machine. Framerate bogs down for no reason for me and the enemys that fly are often going to kill you out of nowhere. Its all randomly generated, but more often than not those flying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s will be in a ridiculous spot that its either easy to shoot them or you are dead before you could even know you were being attacked.\n\nThat said these elements need to be taken and put into a survival horror game. Chance the controls for firearm manipulation to the mouse maybe or not, this game needs to be made.\n\nBut unless you really like to see diffrent games and this "game" is on sale than don't buy it. Its not worth the price they have asked for it because its very very basic to the point of being a demo of gameplay for a much larger game.

It's inherently satisfying to manually reload your weapon as quickly as you can, once you have a grasp on the mechanics. It's tense and fun when you hear a drone around a corner, look out for its camera light, and time it just right to shoot and disable it unscathed. There's some nice use of adaptive music, a scarcity of ammunition forcing you to make every shot count, and some terrifying flying drones to escape from.\n\nHowever, being made in a short amount of time, in Unity, and using randomly generated environments, I've run into framerate issues, repetitive environments, graphical whoopsies, and situations with no chance of success. As well, the objective of collecting tapes involves listening to a monotone voice drone exposition that is often heard over and over again after respawning. You can fully mute the voice volume in the settings, at least.\n\nIt's worth the $5 pricetag, but I was happy to pick it up on sale if you catch my drift.","June 30, 2014","true","18.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It might be a bit too frustrating for the new player to develop a vested interest in.\n-------------------------------------------------------------UPDATED-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you get the mod that can be found somewhere, just look around or ask for it on the community hub, it will improve framerate and add new guns including a shotgun, bolt action rifle, and tommy gun, as well as one or two others. These guns add more depth to the game, operating a bit differently than the ones the game comes with. The framerate boost is extremely helpful.

But it's not that easy. There are enemies scattered around the world and it is your choice to either bypass them or shoot your way through. Remember, your health is a 1 shot kill. So you only get 1 chance.\nThe main core of the gameplay in this game is the guns. Unlike normal shooters, youl have to input various keys to perform actions in your guns. Reloading can take 4 keys to press. The ballistics include bullet drop and ricochet.\nWhile the gun mechanics are pretty realistic, the enemies have a pretty estratigic way to deal with them apart from just shooting them.\nWhile there are only 2 types of enemies, they are enough to make you pull your hair out. Enemies are pretty much sentries and drones. And they must function somehow. The strategy to eliminate enemies is to shoot vital parts. For example, you can shoot the sensor and they won't spot you anymore. Il leave the rest for you to find out the other vital parts. If you so desire to get the game of course.\n\nBut lets review the features of this game.\nFeatures\n\nDetailed simulations of a Colt 1911 pistol, S&W Model 10 "Victory" revolver, and Glock 17 with full-auto mod\nWhile partially true, the guns do have detailed models and ways to operate them. But they mostly include only the important bits of the gun for the gameplay.\n\nTaser robots and machine gun turrets with physically-based damage models\nAs said above before the features. This is true.\n\nBallistic modeling of ricochets and bullet drop\nAgain, as said above, this is true. Nothing else to had.\n\n11 audio tapes to prepare you to defend yourself against the inevitable Mindkill event\nThe tapes are the objective of the game, these tapes explain the world you live in, the guns and how to use them, the machines and how they work etc. They also include parts of the story. I find this a very interesting way to have a tutorial. But it's not a very good way to deliver one. The audio tapes are random, so the chances of you getting a tape explaining how the enemies work, can take sometime.\n\nBecome literate in how guns actually operate\nI can confirm this since I shot the floor, the bullet ricochet and still killed me. Don't shoot the floor kids.\n\nWhile the game can be fun and frustrating at times, it delivers quite an experience no other game can achieve.\nI belive it took me 9 hours to finally complete the game once.\n\nNow for the moment of truth. Buy or not to buy?\nFor 5 bucks, i'd say go for it. While the game is simple with complex mechanics, as a rogue-like I belive it offers alot of replayability.","March 31, 2015","true","16.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Despite being an FPS game, the gameplay focuses more on actually controlling and preparing your firearm and stealth rather than on modern "realistic" cover shooting concepts. Reloading magazines manually,  emptying revolver chambers, and juggling your inventory are actually all very enjoyable, even more so when you manage to learn the controls. The randomization is very strong, starting you off with one of three random handguns, a random amount of ammo, and occasionally a mag light. Room objects, enemies, pickups, and lighting all are randomized, making you want to explore. However, the randomization also causes issues; one game I spawned right next to a taser drone with 3 bullets. Overall, I think this is worth picking up just to experience it, especially with the low asking price.","May 6, 2013","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game's built-in help will still show the old keys :( but the names of the functions listed in the external window where you reassign the keys, those will tell you just what you need to know, and when you have reassigned those functions, you'll kinda know what to do when.

There's some nice use of adaptive music, a scarcity of ammunition forcing you to make every shot count, and some terrifying flying drones to escape from.\n\nHowever, being made in a short amount of time, in Unity, and using randomly generated environments, I've run into framerate issues, repetitive environments, graphical whoopsies, and situations with no chance of success. As well, the objective of collecting tapes involves listening to a monotone voice drone exposition that is often heard over and over again after respawning. You can fully mute the voice volume in the settings, at least.\n\nIt's worth the $5 pricetag, but I was happy to pick it up on sale if you catch my drift.","June 30, 2014","true","18.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is pretty nice in a lot of concepts. For example, how you control your gun. There are 3 basic weapons; The M1911 Colt, the Glock 18, and a .357 Revolver (I think it is a .357) and all three have their own way of control. The Colt and Glock have the same controls except that hitting V forthe Colt will put on the Safety while the Glock makes it either go Semi or Automatic. I like the Revolver and how you can spin the chamber as much as you want with the mouse wheel. Or you can spin it before you place it back. There is a lot of stuff about the game that makes it a good game. On the other hand, I do go through a little bit of some issues here and there. For example, I get random FPS drops when going through different areas on the map, but it goes away half a second later. And I am currently having Lighting FX issues (Probably my side). Besides that, this game is definitely worth it. Especially with the recent gun additions to the game.\n\n9/10","June 29, 2014","true","83.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It might be a bit too frustrating for the new player to develop a vested interest in.\n-------------------------------------------------------------UPDATED-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you get the mod that can be found somewhere, just look around or ask for it on the community hub, it will improve framerate and add new guns including a shotgun, bolt action rifle, and tommy gun, as well as one or two others. These guns add more depth to the game, operating a bit differently than the ones the game comes with. The framerate boost is extremely helpful. With the mod the player can get a lot more out of this game. Good job to whoever made it.","March 3, 2014","true","8.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But it's not that easy. There are enemies scattered around the world and it is your choice to either bypass them or shoot your way through. Remember, your health is a 1 shot kill. So you only get 1 chance.\nThe main core of the gameplay in this game is the guns. Unlike normal shooters, youl have to input various keys to perform actions in your guns. Reloading can take 4 keys to press. The ballistics include bullet drop and ricochet.\nWhile the gun mechanics are pretty realistic, the enemies have a pretty estratigic way to deal with them apart from just shooting them.\nWhile there are only 2 types of enemies, they are enough to make you pull your hair out. Enemies are pretty much sentries and drones. And they must function somehow. The strategy to eliminate enemies is to shoot vital parts. For example, you can shoot the sensor and they won't spot you anymore. Il leave the rest for you to find out the other vital parts. If you so desire to get the game of course.\n\nBut lets review the features of this game.\nFeatures\n\nDetailed simulations of a Colt 1911 pistol, S&W Model 10 "Victory" revolver, and Glock 17 with full-auto mod\nWhile partially true, the guns do have detailed models and ways to operate them. But they mostly include only the important bits of the gun for the gameplay.\n\nTaser robots and machine gun turrets with physically-based damage models\nAs said above before the features. This is true.\n\nBallistic modeling of ricochets and bullet drop\nAgain, as said above, this is true. Nothing else to had.\n\n11 audio tapes to prepare you to defend yourself against the inevitable Mindkill event\nThe tapes are the objective of the game, these tapes explain the world you live in, the guns and how to use them, the machines and how they work etc. They also include parts of the story. I find this a very interesting way to have a tutorial. But it's not a very good way to deliver one. The audio tapes are random, so the chances of you getting a tape explaining how the enemies work, can take sometime.\n\nBecome literate in how guns actually operate\nI can confirm this since I shot the floor, the bullet ricochet and still killed me. Don't shoot the floor kids.\n\nWhile the game can be fun and frustrating at times, it delivers quite an experience no other game can achieve.\nI belive it took me 9 hours to finally complete the game once.\n\nNow for the moment of truth. Buy or not to buy?\nFor 5 bucks, i'd say go for it. While the game is simple with complex mechanics, as a rogue-like I belive it offers alot of replayability.","March 31, 2015","true","16.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game's built-in help will still show the old keys :( but the names of the functions listed in the external window where you reassign the keys, those will tell you just what you need to know, and when you have reassigned those functions, you'll kinda know what to do when.

Now one could make the argument that "it is better than cod" while it might be better in the long run, it is just a sloppy game that had a very short time window. If it had more time then i could see this game being more playable but i seem to be going on nothing so i'll start the real review now.\nFirst off, guns are few to none and tiny little robots that want to turn your chest cavity into swiss cheese are every where, you may spawn with a gun or a flashlight or simply nothing. Finding a gun isn't very easy because you die pretty fast because you have as much bullet resistance as President Lincoln and when you finally get a gun, the magazine is shorter than a Japanese midget.\nObjectives are not marked, there is no way to find your way around and there are no checkpoints. If you find these complaints stupid and like COD, then you have COD on your mind, because listing all the FPS's with those 3 things would take longer than i care for. This game does need navigations though, because every time you die the world gets randomized leaving you lost. Marked objectives are a must have because the only objective is to collect these little VHS tapes or what the hell ever, and they are small as a Chinese elf and some times blend into the enviroment.\nOverall this game is just not worth playing, not only is it filled to the brim with bugs it is only fun for 20 minuets AND you die from 5 feet falls, i sh!t you not. Maybe if they made a Receiver 2 and put more behind it than "OH LOOK WE HAVE RANDOM GENERATED WORLD N' ROBOTS N' GUNS" then i would consider playing it. 3/10","July 16, 2014","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Despite being an FPS game, the gameplay focuses more on actually controlling and preparing your firearm and stealth rather than on modern "realistic" cover shooting concepts. Reloading magazines manually,  emptying revolver chambers, and juggling your inventory are actually all very enjoyable, even more so when you manage to learn the controls. The randomization is very strong, starting you off with one of three random handguns, a random amount of ammo, and occasionally a mag light. Room objects, enemies, pickups, and lighting all are randomized, making you want to explore. However, the randomization also causes issues; one game I spawned right next to a taser drone with 3 bullets. Overall, I think this is worth picking up just to experience it, especially with the low asking price.","May 6, 2013","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And then you become just careless enough to get caught in a simple drone trap that you would've spotted if you weren't in your own head.

This game is great. The idea is fantastic and the sense of survival it goes for is achieved. Does it look like it could have been made in Google SketchUp? YES (at least on my computer it does). But it goes surprisingly deep for what it is. You spawn in a random part of what appears to be a huge house, or apartment bulidings, or neither I'm really not sure. You are then given one of three handguns, a Glock, a revolver, and a Colt 1911. This is where the game get's really interesting. The controls focus around the gun. There is a key set to open the reciever, a key set to take out the magazine, a key set to pull the hammer back. Everything you would actually do with a gun, and magazine for that matter, there's a key for it in this game. To me that is fantastic. It's new to me, and I tend to doubt there have been many if any games that follow that same idea. The second interesting point of this game are the audiotapes you pick up. They give a wonderful backstory to the game, telling you why you are there, and hinting at something sinister. In that way, it's like the Matrix, only voiced by Microsoft Sam. If you see this game for 50%, heck 33% off or more buy it. You will not regret it. This game get's my 7/10. The idea is great, but I wish the game was more replayable.","March 23, 2014","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Random weapon loadout, random level design, search for the mcguffin objectives (with embarassing voice work), and frustrating enemies that have locational damage models that mean that it's pretty much random if your shots do any good.\n\nBasically, the game is designed as youtube scarecam fodder, with all that entails.

Now one could make the argument that "it is better than cod" while it might be better in the long run, it is just a sloppy game that had a very short time window. If it had more time then i could see this game being more playable but i seem to be going on nothing so i'll start the real review now.\nFirst off, guns are few to none and tiny little robots that want to turn your chest cavity into swiss cheese are every where, you may spawn with a gun or a flashlight or simply nothing. Finding a gun isn't very easy because you die pretty fast because you have as much bullet resistance as President Lincoln and when you finally get a gun, the magazine is shorter than a Japanese midget.\nObjectives are not marked, there is no way to find your way around and there are no checkpoints. If you find these complaints stupid and like COD, then you have COD on your mind, because listing all the FPS's with those 3 things would take longer than i care for. This game does need navigations though, because every time you die the world gets randomized leaving you lost. Marked objectives are a must have because the only objective is to collect these little VHS tapes or what the hell ever, and they are small as a Chinese elf and some times blend into the enviroment.\nOverall this game is just not worth playing, not only is it filled to the brim with bugs it is only fun for 20 minuets AND you die from 5 feet falls, i sh!t you not. Maybe if they made a Receiver 2 and put more behind it than "OH LOOK WE HAVE RANDOM GENERATED WORLD N' ROBOTS N' GUNS" then i would consider playing it. 3/10","July 16, 2014","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's kind of the addiction you get from playing qwop, where you barely feel in control, but with a sense of reward from collecting those tapes and those tense moments in each new room where you have no idea if a turret is going to come out of nowhere and shoot your ♥♥♥♥ off.

The "gameplay" was disgustingly designed and felt as though I could do better coding with my left bollock. Half of the entire map is mother♥♥♥♥ing green and I am now blind in my right eye as a result of these graphics that looked as though they were designed with a blunt crayon. I have never come across a game that is this ♥♥♥♥ since 'Intergalactic Cage Match' on the ZS Spectrum.

This is a dispicable excuse for a steam game and I would like it to be obliterated from the face of the Earth for I wish for it never to prey on another poor sod's once valued retinas.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skyminer/recommended/234190/","skyminer","James_Skyminer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skyminer/","163 products in account","I guess this game was made for people who like two things: FPS games and pushing random buttons on the keyboard. This game's main mechanic is having a pistol that you literally need to press a different key to do each action with. Unlike conventional FPSs, reloading is not simply pressing the "R" key, there's a full sequence. I will give the creator of the game the benefit of the doubt and say they were trying to go for interesting mechanics, but all they really succeeded in was creating a frustrating game that's pretty much just annoying to play.\n\nThe game is essentially rogue-like, so even if you end up progressing in the strange plot at all, one small misstep, and you (which I assume is made of paper mache) die and need to restart immediately.\n\nInteresting concept, terrible execution. Honestly, I'm not sure if there is a way to execute said concept WELL, but as it stands, I cannot really say much in favor of this game. Maybe if the devs actually spend more than a week on this game and actually polished it, I could recommend it (Not even making this up, the game was made in a week). But it's buggy. It's basic. The core gimmick mechanic is annoying at best. I got it for free and would not say that anyone should buy this game.","December 18, 2014","false","0.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","3"

Said nobody ever. Reciever takes weapon handeling to a whole new level. The game has a fine art on making you learn how to use a gun from scratch. No PRESS X TO RELOAD title that gets shoved up your eyes, just learn by trial and error which is a nice change of pace. The idea seems cool and I wish they did that in more games. I only wish there was a bit more content in the game but it was made in only seven days so in my books thats an impressive feat. Give me a level editor in a game and in seven days and I can show you why you wasted your time on me. My level would be a mess of red barrels and AI that just stand in their place doing nothing.\n\nOverall Reciever gets a 6.5/10 A decent idea and fun to dabble around in for a small while. Just don't get your hopes up for Battlefield 5: No Glitch Edition.","March 17, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Yes.  Fun? No.  Great idea.  Ultimately poor execution.\nIf it were free, I'd have recommended it. On sale for $1-2, meh-aybe.  Probably not worth $5.\n\nI realize this isn't some triple-A, and I wasn't expecting one.  I don't really regret my $2 spent (on sale).  But if I were to go back I'd probably've skipped this one.  I didn't find the game fun, and often found it frustrating.\n\nThe Good: I really enjoyed the fresh take on the FPS, and appreciate the realism.  I hope some of it is incorporated into full-fledged games.  Though only a few pistols, they contain more character than most game's entire arsenals.\n\nThe Bad: Gotta hack the Linux version a little if you don't wanna play on a 5" screen.  I have a high-end rig, yet performance was somehow a problem.  Its particularly frustrating when you're playing at a crawl-pace to avoid dying (you die so easily and frequently that you're forced to), only for the game to stall for a second when you finally encounter a robot and that's that, game over.  I was frequently placed in dark portions of the level w/o a flashlight to start w/ (even when you find a flashlight, it only illuminates ~10 feet or so).  Even after maxing brightness on my monitor I was annoyed w/ how hard it was to see in the darkness.\n\nOh yeah, and don't expect anything from the 'story', as it consists of tapes w/ an annoyingly borish voice droning on about something I didn't care about (something about how 'dangerously addictive media' had destroyed the world).\n\nIn conclusion, it really is mildly interesting, and I appreciate what the devs did.  Its just more of an experiment/demonstration than a game.","March 10, 2014","false","2.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This is not as easy as it sounds (it's really damn hard actually). Every time you play, the labyrinth-like building you explore is randomly generated as you play, making no two runs the same.\n\nThe most obvious main feature is weapon handling. In this game, you have a gun. I mean REALLY have a gun. If it has parts that can be manipulated, you can manipulate them. Things like safety switches, hammers and even spinning a revolver cylinder around. Learning how to quickly reload a weapon in a combat situation is one of the main challenges of the game.\n\nThere are 2 kinds of enemy, each posing their own threats. After playing for a few hours you'll learn to either hate or fear the beep sound they make when they spot you.\n\nOverall this is a very enjoyable game and is great for killing time.","March 4, 2014","true","15.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Theres also two types of enemies A mind tech turret and a mind tech drone. The game is really fun and the gun mechanics really spice up the gameplay. The first time you reaload your gun you feel the biggest satisfaction. Now about the gameplay. The gameplay is really tight and works fluid. But the difficulty  is insanely difficult.

Theres also two types of enemies A mind tech turret and a mind tech drone. The game is really fun and the gun mechanics really spice up the gameplay. The first time you reaload your gun you feel the biggest satisfaction. Now about the gameplay. The gameplay is really tight and works fluid. But the difficulty  is insanely difficult.

You actually have to manually operate your weapon.\n\nThe game is procedurally generated with regards to the placement of enemies, ammunition, and the objective collectibles.\n\nYour success can depend on what weapons, equipment and however much ammo you start with, all of which are random. You can start with anything from a .44 with a dozen rounds, or a 9mm with three measley bullets.\n\nThe gunplay is satisfying and tactile, and the game is arranged such that you won't need to do the dozen things involved with operating a gun in a hurry. The pace is slow, and you have as much time as you like to get ready.\n\nIt's possible to get up a list of keyboard commands on screen to help you know what to press and what does what.\n\nIn all, a great concept, very well designed. Hopefully we see more like this in the future, with more scenarios perhaps, or some sort of multiplayer deathmatch.\n\nVery good price for a couple of hours fun.

Confusing controls. Buggy help. Even at the lowest possible graphical settings i was getting 10 fps. i can play tf2 1080p on max settings so why are there issues with this? Perhaps with a source engine port and fixed controls, i could enjoy this one.\n\nTo be fair, the difficulty needs to be lowered. An infinite amount of loose bullets would be nice, and "lean" keys so that i could see a turret and not get shot in the face. Also there is no damage gradient, i.e., you are either dead or not, you are not "injured", you are killed.\n\nAlso, there are no nice touches, like smoke at the end of your gun. Needs some artistic work. It seems it wants to be tf2-esque whenever you look at the enemies up close, but the gun models, tape models, bullet models, all seem to be trying to be too realistic, especially in a game where the main objective is to scavenge 80's Walkman tapes and take out cartoony turrets, all the while trying to scavenge and conserve ammo.\n\nThe most offensive part is that there is no fov slider. I feel uncomfortable when i have literally 20 things around the map that can one-hit me that I need to seek out, wit the range of vision Helen Keller has when she is wearing a cone collar. And she's not only blind, deaf, and further restricted by the cone collar, but she's also dead.\n\nBut the controls, oh! the controls. There needs to be a lot of double-binding. i.e.- bind opening and closing the cylinder or attaching/removing the magazine should be the same button. It's not helped by trying to decipher what key does what in the help menu when it is layered on top of itself.\n\nIf you fixed these things, maybe i would try it out again.\n\nVerdict: decide on a artistic style, simplify the controls, optimize optimize optimize, add some features, lower the difficulty, and reconsider some of the existing features.\n\nSuggestions: Make a story either of\n\nA) an 80's cop fighting crime on the streets ( all of the guns in the game already existed in the time period,) where it stressed the difficulty of actually following procedure and how deadly the fighting was.\n\nor\n\nB) a brightly colored ultra-difficult stealth game where one must find and collect the walkman tapes or whatever. Might be sci-fi or 80's themed.\n\nI don’t know what's best for the game. But here are some pointers in the right direction.\n\nBTW, I realize that this was made in a 7 day thing or whatever. I just don’t think it's complete enough for it to be called a game. A hugely expansive, elaborative, and intracite demo/proof of concept, not a game. There just aren't enough mechanics for it to be called a game. Simulator?

Tactifag","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cxero/","76 products in account",">>Hey fanboys, can you stop putting thumbs down because I don't like your silly video game? I'm fairly certain most of you giving this a thumbs down have already bought the game /before/ I put this review here.\n\nReceiver is an interesting firearms simulator video game but it falls short of it's goals with poor execution. I suppose you get what you pay for. Don't always expect just $5 to get you a good video game.\n\nGAMEPLAY: You spawn in a random location with a random pistol with a random amount of ammo. The goal is to find six randomly-placed casette tapes in a randomly-generated map with randomly-placed robot enemies (taser-bots & stationary machine gun turrets). There's ammo randomly placed around the map. You must manipulate every part of your gun with your keyboard. There's no lean feature, so you must expose your entire body in order to get a few shots off at a robot. Considering that you die no matter where you are shot, this becomes extremely problematic. The randomly-generated maps don't fit the gameplay well; you can easily get stuck in odd places thanks to the bizzare level design. Stairs are nightmarish.\n\nPRESENTATION: The game is full of plain, blank textures which have no depth whatsoever. Low-detail textures can look good sometimes (see: Unturned) but this game is trying to create a realistic apartment complex. Without the textures, though, every surface looks like plastic. The skybox is low detail and ugly as sin. The sound effects and music are good, but unfortunately, do little to correct the visual sins.\n\nSTORY: Hardly any story at all. The little story you can get is from the randomly-placed casette tapes. It's just a guy reading from a script in the most boring and monotonous voice thought possible. It sounds like he just got up at 6:30 AM and didn't have his coffee yet.\n\nTHE VERDICT: You should really shell out some extra money in order to get you a better video game. This game doesn't teach you much about actually fighting since there's no human enemies. You can learn how to work a pistol, but if you're the kind of guy who finds this game interesting, you should already know how to use a gun.","November 2, 2014","false","3.2"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"

But a good idea doesn't mean a good game. when I first launched it, all I said was: HOW DO I WHAT? of course you shoot with the left click, but to do as easy things as reloading your gun you MUST learn a 6-7 button combination, witch makes you dead if you have to reload with any enemy around. As for the enemyes there is a turret and a drone. Its easy to deal with the turrets, but if you see a drone... consider yourself dead. There are many guns, but some of them are hardly functional. There are NO skins whatsoever, except for a few dark colors on the enemies. The fact that its a rooftop at night doesn't mean you don't need other colors than grey. After an hour I ended up just turning my flashligt on and off constantly at a wall, just so I can see something else than that one shade of grey. That is IF you have a flashlight. What I  mean is that levels are random each time, and so is your inventory. That goes so far that you can spawn without ANY AMMO, with or without a flashlight, and a game can go on for hours or just five minutes depending on lootdrop, and if you find it or not. Collectables shine and are easy to find most of the times.\n\nIn conclusion I't simular to the virtual boy, it can cause headache (if you're sanity is easily disturbed hallucination)due to a lack of colors. the game is really instable both with the random generation, and with crashes. Its another game that could have been great, but they just rushed it as a joke.

It was created in 7 days.  It is almost entirely about handling guns in an extremely complex and realistic fashion.  It is also about randomly-assembled levels, and listening to cassette tapes, and not being able to see anything.  In some ways it's the very definition of a proof-of-concept game.  The focus is set squarely on the novelty of manipulating firearms realistically.  Everything else is sparse window dressing.  But then, that "everything else" isn't necessarily bad.

Can I recommend this as a "game" though?  No.  Games are fun, this really isn't.  It doesn't even really try; there's no score-keeping or anything.\n\nWhile you fumble about  struggling with the aiming, you're shot once and die.  Or you fall 8-10 feet from one floor to the next and die.  Or you spawn without ammo and you die.  You forgot to unlock the safety and you die.  The enemies are more accurate shots, faster, and more agile than you, so you die.  Speaking of the safety - you can toggle the switch for it, but it doesn't clue you to what is on or off.  So, that's awesome, and yes I died because of it.  Then there's the pointlessness of the flashlight, the badly implemented randomization of levels, gun and ammo.  And you die so quickly that any progress you've made in collecting the tapes is gone.  Enemies take multiple shots to take down - you require one to be brought down.  And if they wanted to make it about realistic gun mechanics then why aren't your hands and arms visible during gun manipulation?  Instead you see the oddness of floating objects in your field of view.\n\nYa know, I'm not in the least bothered by the lack of graphical polish, or the lack of variety in enemies, or it's lack of depth overall (outside of the gun-mechanics, I mean), but it could at least have been fun, which it's not.  I'm not convinced it was ever meant to be either, which is fine so long as you don't call it a game.  I know some have talked about how the muscle-memory building aspect of emptying the shells from your gun and reloading without thinking about it is one of the key points of 'Receiver' that people seem to miss.  I get it, I do.  Some people find simulation of tedious actions fun.  And these particular tedious actions would be fun were the game environment and the enemies encountered also depicted with the same level of realism that the gun mechanics are.  Dying from dropping 8 feet is unlikely in real life.  Even being hit by a single bullet isn't going to necessarily stop you or kill you in real life.  And the aiming mechanic is so unwieldy that finding your mark on those flying tazer-drones is a ♥♥♥♥♥.  And the ultimate goal from suffering through all of this is???  Collecting some cassette tapes.  It's 2014.  I don't even own a cassette player.  There is nothing of interest to keep one coming back except the muscle-memory building, for which there is no score-keeping.  I mean, make me Agent 47 with an objective to assassinate an evil dictator or something and I will gladly struggle with the mechanics to get it done.  Give me points for how quickly I manipulate parts of the weapon correctly...  something!\n\nLong explanation short:  It's just not fun.","October 19, 2014","false","0.4"," 5 of 19 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","5","19","0","0"

The price and the videos about it should reflect that to players.\n\nThe premise of the game is that players will start off with a pistol, it could be a revolver base or a magazine based pistol.  From there, you are going around looking for recordings to find out more about the area that you are trying to escape.  Casing point though, it takes a backseat to the mechanics.\n\nOne of the core concepts of this "demo" is that it is fairly thrilling to reload a pistol all the way through by manipulating each of its mechanisms in a fluid manner under pressure. The hammer, the chamber, the loading or unloading of the magazine all have dedicated buttons which gives this demo a big learning curve because it's not as simple as press "R" to reload your magazines anymore.\n\nThe revolvers are simpler and take less time to learn to reload and ready for firing.\n\nAs for the other parts of the game, the elements of the environment and the mechanical enemies are simple polygons.

The detailed gun mechanics were frustrating at first but gave a sense of accomplishment once I got the patterns down.  (I often found myself compulsively checking the colt/glock to make sure a round was chambered and spinning the revolver cylinder "for luck" before snapping it shut.)\n\nThe randomized tapes remind me a little of Dear Esther's non-linear storytelling (if someone did a Dear Esther/Receiver mashup, I would buy that in a heartbeat :)\n\nIf you are frustrated by making mistakes and learning through trial-and-error, you will probably not enjoy this game.  To get anywhere, you will die and restart.  A lot.  Bullets are scarce, and you die in one hit, so it's not a game for people who want to rush around blowing things away.  Much of my enjoyment of the game came from efficient use of those scarce bullets and outwitting the drones.\n\nIf you are interested in game design and how design decisions and minimalist storytelling affect the player experience, this is definitely worth a look.","June 1, 2014","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I quickly took up the challenge to learn the keys and the appropritae sequences without relying on the guide, I dare say this only took me 20 minutes of play time to get down pat.\n\nDespite the simplistic nature of the enemies (a drone that has to ram you and has terrible flight pathing, and a stationary turret that scans in a radial loop) Their loud 'target accquired' beeps caused overwhelmingly tense situations unrivalled by any other modern FPS. These situations were only exacerbated by knowing it was one hit one kill from these drones, forcing you to be swift and always ready.\n\nAs I summarised, the game is very earlier in development. Hopefully development continues and more content is added at a frequent pace.\n$5 dollars is I think a bit much for this game in its current state, but liek most early access games, its a entry bar none that gets you in on the ground floor before its worth more.\n\nI'd say check it out if your interested in a truley new spin on fps!","February 5, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.\n\nGameplay: Definitely one of the more interesting FPSes I've played. It's easily described as Slender but with guns, and while that's not bad, it does miss what this game is truly about, which is to emulate gun mechanics as accurately as possible. No longer in this game are you able to press the easy reload button. Instead, you have to go through the motions for each and every gun. While that may sound tedious, it's actually pretty fun in execution. Much like Slender, this game does have a very randomized nature to it, which can be both a benefit and a downfall. It's always disappointing being met with three turrets in a row whenever you've only got three bullets in your magazine. This game can be completed relatively quickly (hence the short playtime, but there's another reason for that), but it's still a pretty fun game nonetheless. 7/10.\n\nStory: Hey guys, do you like The Matrix? If so, you'll be able to tell ALL of the "inspirations"! But hey, they did it in a non-linear manner, so that's pretty neat. 6/10.\n\nGraphics: The sore spot of this game. The game looks alright for a game that was submitted to a game jam, but HOLY BUTTS IS IT UNDEROPTIMIZED. Apparently the reason for this is because they used an older version of Unity, but even after using the mods (the reason why my playtime is apparently only 50 minutes), the game still ran my GTX 760 through the ringer. This is also apparently because of how the lighting is handled. Plus, there's some pretty obvious and ugly gaps in the level geometry. There's also loading zones here and there that bring the game to a screeching halt so that things can load or something. Either way, the graphics side of this game, even though it was for a game jam, is potentially a deal breaker for some (since they may not be able to run it). 1/5.\n\nMusic: Well, there is none. The voiceacting is pretty uninterested (presumably one of the devs), but the gun sounds are alright...? I dunno; nothing too remarkable here. 2/5.\n\nOverall score is 7/6/1/2; 5.0/10. Again, keep in mind that this game was made in seven days. However, this still doesn't excuse how bad it runs, as it just feels like I paid money for a throwaway project. A decent throwaway project, but a throwaway project nonetheless. It's still fairly fun, though; pick it up when it's like $1 or something.","May 10, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You run around shooting these sneaky little robots. The twist is that the gun that you weild is painfully realistic. Quite a few firearm mechanics come into play in this game. For someone like me who has shot guns quite a bit(FAR from an expert with guns though), I picked up on it pretty quick. For someone with less knowledge about firearms, these mechanics may take awhile to learn and might be frustrating. But that's the game really. It's less about the robots and more about you maneuvering this machine you're shooting them with. You have to remember all the steps of reloading in order and have to be able to do it fast. The game looks nice. It's going for a minimalistic style which it achieves nicely(at least to my eyes).\nHowever, it's HORRIBLY optimized. You've probably heard this from the bad reviews, and what they say is true. For how it looks and how much is going on, this game should not run my graphics card hotter than Battlefeild at a lower frame rate. As long as you have a decent system that can run this, you'll be fine, but it's still rediculous none the less. There's also problems with the map spawning to. I sometimes find myself getting stuck in certain areas and have to restart because there's no place to go. With all it's problems, it's still amazingly fun. Don't let all of this deter you. If you have $5, go for it. It's a few hours entertainment for less than the cost of a movie ticket.","April 23, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
