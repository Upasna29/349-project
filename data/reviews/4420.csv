"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JoneSSS/recommended/4420/","JoneSSS","sayler_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JoneSSS/","2879 products in account","An amazing RPG. A few glitches that i've encountered : the teleport system being unstable and while teleporting to a specific location you can wake up in a totally different place, also there are some map glithes when enemies, your companions or even you can get stuck in certain spots being unable to move, though this can be fixed just with restarting the game. Despite of this insignifiant "problems" i found this game to be extremely entertaining. A lot of quest to be done, a wide variety of items, a lot of companions to choose from, who help you in your journey and in the meantime by the answers you give them to their question you can influence the attitude they will have towards you, if your companion is a woman you can even get her in love with you. It is pretty important in Silverfall that you chose right from the start if you want to go the technology or the nature path. If you do quests of the opposing faction you lose points with yours and that means you can't use your best armor and maybe even some skills anymore. So, before starting playing the game i would recommend finding some external info about the quest for each side. to keep track of what you should and shouldn't do. I had a great time playing it, and now  i'm looking foward to Earth Awakening expansion.","November 29, 2013","true","51.6"," 57 of 65 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","57","65","0","3"

It is basically a Dungeon Siege clone, albeit less polished. The interesting aspect is the decision between nature and technology the player has to take. Unfortunately, in the long run the whole setup gets somewhat boring and repetitive, with the game seemingly lacking some fine tuning, and the somewhat crappy inventory management being more annoying than necessary. On the plus side there is the character development/skill system.\n\nIf your main focus is on combat and leveling and gathering of the best loot, you may still want to give this a try if you've already done with Torchlight, Dungeon Siege etc. and do not mind the weaknesses of "Silverfall".","August 22, 2014","true","120.6"," 45 of 52 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","45","52","0","0"

I picked it up for less than $4, and it is totally worth it. You can easily get in 20 hours of enjoyable gameplay solo. The skill master rapidly drains your money if you don't plan out your characters, but I just started new if I didn't like a character by level 15. If you have a lan connection for multiplayer, then I'd say you will triple your game time. The controls can be difficult to work with, but targeting is simple, and hotkeys will allow you to organize what is important to your character. It also has some minor glitches with movement and occassionally leveling. Typos are abundant, but all in all it is an endearing little game.","December 12, 2013","true","21.0"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

I found it hard to wrap my head around the mini map and the orientation of the whole game.  Plus the character is prone to getting stuck in the most awkward moments.\n- extremely difficult, coupled by the fact that when you die you lose all your equipped items.

To it's credit it includes a wide variety of items, interesting stylized graphics, as well as complex crafting and skill trees.  Unfortunately, at high widescreen resolutions, the onscreen text and menus are incredibly small making it difficult and tedious to read quests and navigate the various character screens.  In addition, the camera control, while allowing 360 degree movement, is not automatically tethered to the orientation of the mini-map, making simple navigation a chore.  Lastly, the actual action can grow a little dull, as melee characters in particular need only select a target and sit back while the ai and pc automatically duke it out.  Despite these deficiencies, Silverfall is certainly a solid addition to any RPG library.","March 11, 2012","true","2.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

This game is ultimately a ruse. A mirage. At first glance it's beautiful. Visually, the combination of good graphics and Cel Shading is stunning. Quickly, however the true gamer realizes the actual gameplay is flawed beyond reproach. Lackluster clunky combat, an archaic quest system and VERY liminted voice acting make this game mediocre at best. A poor ecuse for an action RPG, and a poor excuse for either genre, period.\n\nThe combat barely passes as a Diablo clone. The camera options, while involved, are seemingly limited, scarring the experience at every turn. Choose one angle, you'll be doomed to limited view, choose another, you'll be thrust into a pseudo-3d world. Any camera you choose limits the experience.\n\nCouple this with repetetive combat and repetetive gameplay. I.E. NO puzzle solving, no clickable objects. Basically, you kill, kill kill, LEVEL up, add stats,. collect loot, KILL some more repeat.\n\nThere are some notable points of interest. They have graciously added in their desperate quest to copy Diablo, more options for loot...you can get yellow, green, blue white AND artifact (brown and rarest) loot types. Beyond this, Silverfall is a hack and slash nightmare...it will remind you of all the cliches of a game of this genre, while satisfying next to none of those expectations.\n\nExpect the expected with Silverfall.
