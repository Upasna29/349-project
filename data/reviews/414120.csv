"http://steamcommunity.com/id/D-Vive/recommended/414120/","D-Vive","D Vive","http://steamcommunity.com/id/D-Vive/","44 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA flagship Vive experience that really takes advantage of the Vive's strengths. Tracked motion controls make it like you live inside Garry's Mod instead of just playing around with stuff. It's not just what you can build that's cool, but that the objects and tools feel so good. It's an even better physics game creation kit than a contraption builder.\n\nThere's plenty of immediate fun from a collection of built-in scenes like shooting gallery and ping-pong (instant favorites for me), and many others which are all editable. Plus you can share your levels or contraptions and download others using Steam Workshop. Actual multiplayer is planned but not available yet though. There's so much content already that the only way you won't get your money's worth is if you somehow just don't like physically interacting with things or building things.\n\nShooting Range\nI started off in the shooting range and took out targets using the crossbow and pistol and shurikens. I tried and failed to shoot an arrow straight up and land it on myself, but I got pretty close a few times. Once I realized I could shoot the platter with the pistol I spent 20 minutes just doing that. Throw it up, shoot it down range, shoot it repeatedly on the same side to spin it faster and faster, warp to chase it down or spawn something new. Even with just the no-frills pistol it's really fun to practice shooting using different techniques.\n\nPing-pong / table tennis\nThis was the best surprise and made me care enough to write this review. The ball and stroke mechanics are amazing and could easily be the core of a dedicated game. Whatever they did I hope they never change it.\n\nI'm not a tournament-level table tennis player by any means, but have trained with some serious people and have a table and ball machine in real life - and I was blown away at how realistic the shot-making is in modbox. At first I had no expectations and batted the ball around, which worked well, so I decided to try hitting some realistic shots, which took some getting used to. It's not like the wii where you're instantly good at everything from being a gamer.\n\nI tweaked the included ping-pong level's ball machine to send slightly deeper and faster shots from farther away to make it easier. Then I spent 45 straight minutes hitting every kind of shot I could think of against the dummy. I was able to use a deep shakehand grip comfortably with the Vive controller and hit topspin, backspin, pushes, drives, sidespin, drop shots, and even fade loops from forehand or backhand. Hook loops didn't work as well as I'd hoped, but I'm not that great at them anyway so it's probably me. By the end I could reliably bounce a shot off the dummy and follow it up to the open court. I was sweating from driving with my legs and moving but it was a ton of fun.\n","April 20","true","1.9"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

Perhaps it's a little early for a review, but modbox is a stunning look forward into the future of VR for productivity and creativity. I can't wait to see the mods to come. I actually think I can use modbox to design cusom workstations for my manufacturing process. It's a great way for me to test my ideas for space allocation, ergonomics and functionality.

His discovery of building cars and trains, from scratch and that work, has unlocked a whole new level of his imagination.\n\nIf I let him I'm pretty sure he would spend an entire week inside this experience.\n\nMy sole complaint is that time evaporates when building in Modbox and listening to a custom playlist. There's just something remarkable that happens when you start crafting machines and contraptions.\n\nIf you enjoy creating "things" and random experiments, you'll enjoy this title.","May 11","true","12.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

For example: Swinging a bat or a sword, the handle/hilt is 1:1, and the rest is delayed depending on how far away it is. Imagine pulling a balloon on a string; the string is 1:1, with the balloon to follow after.\n\nIt makes such objects almost useless."","April 10","true","1.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

You can build structures, vehicles, interactive objects and share them with the community. Don't expect any sort of built in "game", it's a total sandbox, and although you can try out stuff other people have built, there's no goals or story here. You can kind of make your own games without any programming, which is where I see the biggest potential. I'll be keeping an eye on this as it grows.","April 9","true","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You can create different "scenes" using provided assets and make different things. You can also share them and others can download them. I didn't make anything, cause I'm not very creative like that, and just downloaded some. I played a bowling one, an archery one, a lab one, and a baseball one, and some others. It's kind of neat, but NOT worth the price, at least for me.\n\nIf you like building creative things to mess around in, and physics-based-sandboxes, this game may be for you. It's kind of similar to Garry's mod, I guess. However, this game does NOT have multi-player, which I think is essential for these kind of games. If this game had multi-player, I could reccomend it, but as of right now, there's just nothing to do.\n\nEdit: Apparantley they plan on adding multiplayer. If they do so, this game may be worth buying.","May 20","false","0.2"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","2"

It feels like early access in that it's kinda sparse.\n\nThat being said, playing this game in VR is a lot of fun. Others have drawn comparisons between this and Gary's Mod. That's a fitting comparison, though I would say that given the nature of VR, this feels less like a sandbox game and more like you're actually there and playing with a unique set of toys.\n\nThe items you're given actually feel like they're right there in front of you, when you build a contraption that works, it  is very fulfilling.\n\nI'm looking forward to getting more tools to work with, perhaps some scenarios that need to be overcome using your ingenuity and the tools at hand.\n\nI also hope some more work is done on the physics as throwing things can feel a little bit off, for example throwing a basketball makes the ball feel heavier than it should be.\n\nWho knows, either way, this is a great title for people who want something engaging to play with their Vive. There are countless hours of fun to be had already, and it will probably only get better over time.","May 16","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Imagine being able to build weird stuff, including: RC cars and dumb vehicles, small little "dollhouse" models to play with, huge contraptions with tubes, game setups for example I build one where you need to throw rings into poles, and one where you need to aim a slingshot correctly to shoot a basketball.\n\nIt's really nice if you have the creativity to play with it, the controls are really intuitive too and the presence is there.\n\nWhat's missing: it needs more content, more stuff! And also it crashes often when you play with elastic bands and ropes. Anyway, I can't not reccomend this if you like physics sandboxes.","May 18","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
