I've played every table by both major companies on Steam to the tune of many thousands of games, but all that is pretty much in the past, because I have discovered Pro Pinball Ultra's "Timeshock" table. Most days it’s the only pinball I play.\n\nIn the 35 days since Timeshock was released 0n 1/27/16, I've recorded over 1,200 games. And I've yet to even BEGIN to be bored with playing the same table, mostly because Timeshock has so much depth and challenge. It's hard! I would go so far to say that even with its "novice" mode, it's not a table for beginners, but it IS the table to strive toward playing, no matter one's skill level, or the amount of time one has to devote.\n\nWith Timeshock's many challenging modes, including a 4-level video mode that really adds tremendously, there is no clue when a game begins if it will end with a score of 3 million, or 300 million....or much more. I tend to have a short attention span and often get frustrated fairly easily, but at least for me, Timeshock is pretty much rage-proof, because it's just so MUCH fun to play! (And I’m really only an average pinball player.) The challenge of some shots is the very source of the tremendous feeling of success I sometimes get, and I can honestly say that with time comes much greater proficiency, and tremendous personal satisfaction.\n\nTimeshock offers a very complex story about time travel, and the acquisition of artifacts from the varying periods visited.  The table guide I typically use, by Jens Goering -  http://www.jeeens.de/t/t.html , is 32 pages of valuable information and graphics, very well written and structured. Clearly, this is no simple table to be mastered overnight, but rather a commitment than might require years of pure joy.\n\nNot only is the Timeshock table itself interesting and challenging, there are numerous varying methods of play to choose from, each adding its own dimension of fun. As well, each has its own leaderboard to track progress against players the world over. It even has an unusual “glass removed” feature that allows the player to investigate the table actions in great detail (but does not count on leaderboards.) If a player had done well on the first three balls during any regular game, Timeshock offers the opportunity to extend the game by up to three additional balls for what offers the possibility of REALLY high scores for the best players. And Timeshock has my ALL-TIME favorite score in pinball; Lucky!, a 5 million point shot when you almost lose the ball down the left outlane. (Admittedly, I haven’t personally accessed many of the high-score features, so please forgive and notify if errors have been made in this review.)\n\nAt first glance it might seem that Timeshock is more expensive than most single computer pinball tables, and I really bought it because I had heard so much about it for so long. (It is a truly legendary pinball table, perhaps the MOST renowned single computer pinball table available.) But while I paid about $15US, after a little over a month it comes to just over a penny a game, a pittance I’m grateful didn’t prevent me from THE pinball experience of my lifetime.\n\nPerhaps one of the finest features of Timeshock came on Day One when I was unable to complete installation on one of my laptops. The DEVs requested pertinent info from my PC, and within 2 -3 days had graciously corrected the problem. As I often say, perhaps the best feature of any game is an attentive DEV. (Thank you, all.)\n\nIf you love pinball and want both a great challenge AND great fun, Timeshock will very likely be THE pinball experience you will never regret considering.\n\n(As with most Steam games, offline Timeshock play is not tracked.)","March 1","true","139.4"," 34 of 34 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","34","34","0","5"

Wow, it is an absolute work of art. The lighting, the effects, the physics - it's all spot on. It feels right. This feels like a real pinball table in a way most other video pinball just doesn't. Suddenly, as I began to play, I wished with all my heart that all of the tables on Farsight's "The Pinball Arcade" could be recreated by Barnstorm Games instead, to do those old beloved tables justice in a far more accurate preservation. Barnstorm Games' love for pinball is present in every minute detail. It's there in the travel of the ball. It's there in the gentle reflections of light. It's there in the click of the flipper. The ka-chunk of the targets.\n\nEven the physics in the in-table video mode DMD game are better than I would expect from a pinball table!\n\nIf you love pinball, actual real pinball tables, try this game. Treat yourself! You will love it and it will love you back.\n\nHowever, let me get back to details on what's so "my goodness this is so Early Access". When I first downloaded the game through Steam, I thought to myself "Oh, only ~700MB? That's pretty small!" - then I started it up and rather than letting me into the game and giving me an option to log in as a minor feature, the first thing I saw when I started up the game were some big ugly grey boxes, asking me to log in, or play as guest. I thought to myself "I kickstarted this, so I probably have a login somewhere...." - so I spent a good long while activating a forum account, retrieving a password, then activating that password. Then I logged in. Thankfully you only seem to need to do that once!\n\nThen the next thing I see is a dialogue box telling me that it's downloading another ~500MB of data. Then it unpacks it. Then I'm in! So I go "hey, I wonder if logging in did anything special!" and click on Account. It looks like it did nothing special. So I click on the arrow to go "back", and it black screens so I need to exit the app entirely.\n\nThen I decided to try playing the table. And it crashes out again. So I restart the game, and it works this time.\n\nNow, there aren't any instructions for keys when you're looking at the table, nor on the pause menu, so I went through pressing all the keys on my keyboard to see if I could start a game. I didn't find it (fyi - you press the "S" key!) so I exited, then saw the instructions (and story!) under a little icon on the (mostly empty) main menu.\n\nThe actual table makes up for everything. But still - there's a lot of things they still need to do to make the overall experience of starting the application and getting into the game much better.","January 28","true","2.2"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","19","21","2","0"

When it was originally developed using actual CAD and pinball engineering software, it was WAY ahead of even real pinball machines. It used too many feature lamps on the matrix, actual accurate switch location design was not really considered, and the physical mechanics were not directly feasible (Time Crystal, ramp alignment, etc) based on what was included in the virtual game among other factors. It is an absolute classic that although has taken FOREVER to get to this stage, is still worth the time and money.\n\nIf you want to complain about this only being one table, go play Pinball Arcade by Farsight Studios.  The ball physics of this table, however, are much more accurate and the detail of the table is refined.\n\nMy credentials for assessment review of this pinball simulation are direct and simple.\nI restore pinball machines as a collector, technician, and operator and have done so for well over a quarter century.  I still maintain a large "stable" private collection of machines.\nI am not a millenlial gamer.\nI was involved the Bally/Williams pinball department in the 1990s.\nI am intrinically aware of the challenges and design of pinball machines at both an electronic and physical level.\n\nCurrently, this simulation is being developed as a sample prototype machine by Silver Castle Pinball.

Their promise was that with the money earned by the Kickstarter, they would be able to speed up development. This was in the end of 2013. Yes, 2013. They promised it would be finished at the start of 2014. With barely any communication they just contineud to postpone the release without actually telling anyone about the progress of the game.\n\nNext, the optimisation is very bad. The game might look pretty, but does not run well at all on any standard gaming pc. Also the angles of the tables are not changeble. And now the UI is actually on top of the table, the table looks very small and is not comfortable to play on (for me at least).\n\nI hope they will still be able to improve and optimise performance of the game and also add the angles THE ORIGINAL GAME had. But with this slow progress, the game probably won't be out of 'early access' before 2020.","January 28","false","0.8"," 26 of 44 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","26","44","3","6"

Those familiar with the original game will feel right at home, because although the ball physics are vastly improved, the table still feels exactly the same.\n\nGlass-Off mode is a welcome addition too, as it lets you practice tricky shots and combos, and allows you to advance through difficult missions just by clicking the ball and flicking it where it needs to go (great for when you're curious about some of the later missions but lack the skill to reach them legitimately!).\n\nPerformance is excellent; I've never dipped below 60 FPS, even during intense multiballs. The game generally hovers at around 120-150 FPS on an FX 8350 and HD7970 at 1440p and 4x MSAA when a single ball is in play. I've seen it go as low 75 FPS when there are seven balls on the table.\n\nIn the future I'd like to see options added for table tilt, flipper strength and level of wear (some of my favourite features to play with in Big Race USA), and of course, more tables!

If the differences aren't immediately apparent, remember that's only because the 1997 original was so far ahead of the curve. The lighting effects in this version have to be seen to be believed - static screnshots don't really do them justice. Every piece of wire, every screw, every element is lit up by the hundreds of lights on the table and you can see every one of them reflecting and reacting to what's going on, it's *beautiful*. You'd swear they'd mounted a camera on a physical table and filmed it (at very, very high resolution!)\n\nThe static camera is not an issue for me, although it's a pity there's only one choice of viewing angle and no cabinet mode (both allegedly to be added in future updates). Also, the physics are the same as the original version - not that the ball motion is especially bad, in fact not the worst on the market even 15 years later, but it would be nice to see some improvements in the state of the art.\n\nOf course a lot of people will complain that there's only one table in the game, it's true, but Timeshock has the deepest and best ruleset of any pinball sim I've seen. Better that than twenty-five copy-paste games with cosmetic differences but near-identical gameplay.

If you like pinball or are just even slightly interested in it, buy it now.\n\nThis is a graphically updated version of the excellent pinball simulation Timeshock from 1997. The Pro Pinball series was the absolute top of PC pinball back then and has not been surpassed since. This updated version does the game justice. The updates include higher resolution, better lighting and portrait mode, which of course works great for pinball.\n\nThe table itself is unchanged, which is a good thing. It remains one of the best tables I have ever played virtual or real. The table design is perfect, the shots have exactly the right difficulty and feel very satisfying. The ruleset is very deep, there are an incredible number of modes, super modes, wizard modes, frenzys, manias, video mode... etc. which will keep all but the most seasoned pinball veteran occupied forever. (I have played this table for almost 20 years and never reached the super wizard mode in normal play.) The modes and table elements all interact to form a path and a story. Still, the table keeps a simple elegance and is not overwhelming, even for beginners.\n\nThe updated graphics are gorgeous, the light show at the beginning of the time travel mode is one of the best in any pinball machine. The sound and music were not upgraded, but still do the job nicely. The guitar music soundtrack is a matter of taste, I personally like it a lot. There are different tracks for different game situations and modes and they fit very nicely.\n\nThis is a simulation of a real world pinball table, there even is an operator's menu to tweak the internal settings of the machine. That also means it is quite difficult, especially compared to the more arcady games like Pinball FX and Pinball Arcade. The table is unforgiving, but never unfair. Through the operator's menu the game can be made easier, but for me the standard settings work well.\n\nThere are a few things that are still missing: UI to change default controls, controller support and more table views. I was the most disappointed that they have not improved the physics to at least the level of the later Pro Pinball games „Big Race USA” and “Fantastic Journey” yet, I hope this is coming soon. The current physics model is from the original game. It is by no means bad and feels very real. It is in every way superior to other games like Pinball Arcade. But the physics of the later Pro Pinball games are even better and I was hoping that 20 years later and with superior hardware, this could have been taken up another notch.\n\nThese things are promised, unfortunately Barnstorm Games has not exactly convinced with speed on what is a mere upgrade and has struggled through 2 years of development. I hope they can improve their development process and dedication to the PC platform, implement the missing features soon and hopefully even upgrade the other old tables and design new ones.\n\nWhile the price of this game is higher than other tables on the market, it is absolutely justified by the superior simulation. The table design is on a completely different level than Pinball FX tables and the realism and graphics easily and clearly surpass Pinball Arcade. This table makes these other pinball games look bad by comparison. It would be amazing if the Pinball Arcade developers could reach the same level of detail and realism. The table design can absolutely compare to some of the best real tables out there, so it is not surprising that there is a company working on a real world version of Timeshock.\n\nI have been playing the original for almost 20 years and I know I will play this for at least as long. For an early access game it is already very much playable and I can recommend it highly to both pinball experts and beginners.","January 30","true","38.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

As far as virtual/digital pinball goes, I think it is only beaten by one table: Fantastic Journey. FJ had the last and best physics that Barnstorm created, but I think a lot of the rubber on the table was firmer too (less bouncy) and maybe that's why I prefer it.\n\nWriting a review is tricky here: I'd give the original Timeshock 10/10. The score would be due to the table design AND the implementation (the physics, the views given, the virtual DMD, the soundtrack, everything about it). But lots of that stuff in not done for this version of Timeshock yet, and the physics will be changed (note that it was stated that there would be an option included to allow play with the original physics; not sure how leaderboards will deal with this though).\n\nSo it's tricky to review 'Pro Pinball Ultra' you see.\n\nPersonally, I expect Barnstorm to put in all the time needed to make it as good as it can possibly be: I have that faith. I feel safe recommending the game that will be, but as I write this review the original 'finished' Timeshock is better.","January 30","true","1.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

However I can only play it for a few seconds before my computer crashes... in that time, as i looked over the game I didn't see anything that was very interesting. The only thing i liked about the game is that it offers an option to play it at 2560 x 1440, so i can load it on my monitor in portrait style, which makes the play area a lot larger than on a landscape oriented monitor and so there is no need for the game to alter the perspective of the table as you play. This was the first pinball game I bought for the pc and thought that maybe my computer wasn't powerful enough to run pinball games but then i took a chance and bought a bunch of pinball games from pinball arcade and i was able to play for hours without a problem. I have a core i7 3.4 GHz cpu with a firepro v7900 video card. Based on the fact that i am not able to play the game for more than a few seconds, and what I did see while playing it wasn't interesting to me, I should probably give it a one star out of five, but since it has the option to play at 2560 x 1440, which is an excellent idea, I will give it a generous two stars...also if the game worked for more than a few seconds, it's possible I would have discovered more about the game that I liked.","March 14","false","1.6"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","9","0","0"
