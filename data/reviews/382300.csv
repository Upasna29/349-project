One minute the scares are provided courtesy of what appears to be a former Mr. Universe, rampaging around the manor in a state of permanent undress. The next it's the bouncing ball scene from The Changeling, complete with the distant giggles of ghostly children. You can also look forward to the infamous mannequin sequence from Condemned, a facsimile of the Bethesda lock-picking mini-game, phantom spiked walls and a spot of safe-cracking, complete with stethoscope. It's kind of an entertaining mess in as far as the actual scares go but what this game does nail completely is the atmosphere. The house looks fantastic, full of the kind of junk and clutter you'd find clogging up your 'Misc' inventory in Fallout, with plenty of plot to unearth as you move from room to room.\nI'd really recommend a new character model for He-Man or whoever he's supposed to be. At the minute, he looks like a fetish stripper or maybe Lord Humungous from Mad Max 2. Whenever I see him, I feel less like he wants to kill me and more like he wants to suplex me through a table to retain his Hardcore Championship.\nCheck out my fun with it below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB5SuWMijjc\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZLXGEpCqtI","July 21, 2015","true","3.6"," 105 of 130 people (81%) found this review helpful 67 people found this review funny","81","105","130","67","5"

Spiking down to under the occasional 40 fps and stutter running on a gtx 980ti.  Game is capped at 60 fps, which isn't so bad, but game doesnt run at a constant 60 fps.  ALT Tabbing often causes issues and if you didn't save before you alt-tabbed you would have to manually kill the game process just to get out.  Game draws over 1gb of ram during these crashes.\n\nOnto the game: I'm afraid that even after the game's full release, it is impossible to beat the game unless you are lucky and do not receive the 'unable to equip your pistol bug'.  A ghostly mansion exploration game that started out sinister and scary quickly went underground and turned into a hectic run around the circle pacman game.  That's right, you can't fight back with the broken combat system, and activating your objective is an onerous task that is close to impossible.  Despite the minor issues such as being unpolished with plentiful grammatical errors and clipping issues, (you can see through the door in the very first scene; wow, way to start things off) the game was endurable to a certain extent and immersion wasn't totally killed off.\nHowever, after the first chapter, chapter two quickly becomes a run around game.  Rather than staying true to the elements of horror, the occult, and mystery, the game introduces... combat... with a gun you CANNOT use.  You would pick up a pistol and it would just be in your inventory until you die and then it disappears. You find yourself getting repeatedly killed by the same enemies at the same spot no matter how you try to run—WAIT, did I mention RUN?  In this game, running is not much different than walking and you are better off jumping to move around more quickly.  Your "running" is slower than all of the enemies I have met thus far.  In other words, running is damn useless.  Holding the shift key is like holding down a dummy button, might as well walk.  According to the developer, the game could take around 2 hours or even less.  I have 1.7 hours in and am merely in chapter 2.  I'm done trying to beat this game.  Disappointment all around now.\n\nTL;DR\n~Running is painfully slow; to the point where walking and jumping is more reliable.\n~Lack of key binding and controls ( You cannot view the controls in the options or something so if you weren't paying attention to the loading screen, you would have to start over to see the in game controls again.)\n~ Still has clipping issues such as seeing through doors\n~ Grammatical Errors\n~ Horrendous not fully functioning combat system (you can't fight back)\n\nDon't take my word for it? See the issues right now:\nChapter 2 Major issues: http://steamcommunity.com/app/382300/discussions/0/541907867775138459/\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/382300/discussions/0/541907867773569351/\n\nChapter 1 Issues:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/382300/discussions/0/541907867769739371/\n\nNo rebinding keys, invert mouse and 100% unplayable: http://steamcommunity.com/app/382300/discussions/0/541907867764919511/\n\nIssues on Linux and resolution in general:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/382300/discussions/0/541907867771549851/\n\nMore issues in the discussion as well.\n\nConclusion: Trying to stay positive, but yup, this "completely released' game is nothing more than 'promised future updates' and is not a playable game.  An unplayable, typical mansion exploration game that has bland  [s]not[/s]  working combat.  I can only recommend that Fans of horror are better off purchasing a true horror game and fans of FPS are better off playing any other casual fps game.  Sorry, a game with such poor functionality should not be allowed in the store.  SAVE YOURSELF 5 dollars and a couple hours trying to get this game to work; right now it just ain't worth it. Kudos to the developer trying to fix things, but because things are not resolved and playable yet, the game should be in early access not a full release and trick me and many others into purchasing the game. Games like these make it skeptical for me to try any newly released indies game in the future.  Will request a refund ASAP.","August 8, 2015","false","1.7"," 72 of 90 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","72","90","6","4"

That is my best attempt at kindness; honestly, I am a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about the whole thing.\n\nThe story doesn't happen.  They try the classic environmental storytelling via notes and such.  The grammar is poor and nothing connects.\n\nThey also try voice acting via some spotty narration.  It's not any better; the voice dialogue is literally a guy explaining exactly what mundane thing is happening at the time.  "Show, don't tell" is a valuable lesson to be learned here.\n\nThe assets used to fill this game are a bad joke.  While you can pick up 50% if the items on tables and rotate them not ONE time did this contribute to the game.  No hidden codes.  No puzzle hints.  It is the most pointless feature they could have added.\n\nI picked up a BUNCH of items.  I had to strain to see how they actually fit into the game world.\n\nBut, is it scary? If it was we wouldn't be having this discussion.  It's not.  It's almost scary a bunch of times.  I amp myself up to get scared and I was let down.  There were many, many times I was like... man they really ♥♥♥♥ed up on a great opportunity to get me good.  The best example is here is a telescope you can look through in one random room and see someone's cell phone camera video scanning a city at night-time.  The fact they didn't try to make it matter to the game was bad enough; but the lack of anything creepy to be seen was offensive.\n\nThe game pulls a 180 and goes into gun combat.  First you shoot the same straw man monster over and over. It is not fun. It is not scary.\n\nThen you are in the woods and you kill animals.  Not monster animals. Just regular bears, deer, foxes, and bunnies.  For a puzzle.  Yes, this game goes full on hunting sim.  (Someone in my stream made a joke asking when the dating sim portion was going to happen, I paused and seriously thought it was possible).\n\nThis just illustrates how much this game has no sense of self or direction. Its everywhere and nowhere.\n\nThe ending was just a small reminder of what could have been.  Not that it made sense or was any kind of payoff for the time spent playing the game.  Shame too, the one good monster you barely saw twice.\n\nIn short, save your money.\n\nI bought this game. :(\n","August 8, 2015","false","2.6"," 68 of 92 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","68","92","5","5"

It fits the atmosphere of the game.\n• The premise of the story. The hook of the game being an actual story being told is interesting.\n• It's not the prettiest game I've ever seen. But what it lacks in overall visual polish, it makes up for with execution. The lighting and sound direction make the environments engaging. They really help in building suspense.\n\nCons\n• The controls are sluggish and annoying. While aiming is well done, shooting feels stiff and... I don't know. Just bad.\n• The execution of the story wasn't the best. Despite enjoying the premise, the actual storyline is weak and seemingly shoehorned in. You really don't get enough from the gameplay to fit it into what you're told by the narrator. Which means that while the premise was interesting, the game would have been better off without it as it just leads to raised hopes and a disjointed experience.\n• Combat is strange. The enemies get caught on, sometimes invisible, seemingly random geography. The pathfinding for the NPC's is just bad. On the one hand it's sort of useful as they tend to rush you, but mostly it just negates any suspense that had been built up.\n• The random soda bottles. Really? What the hell is that about? The mannequins I understand, they're suitably creepy, but random lemon-lime looking soda two-liters? It's really jarring and pulls me out of the game, it just makes no sense to me, but maybe I'm missing something.\n• I don't know if it's just me, but the achievements don't seem to work. Despite beating the game I haven't received any of the 8 achievements. Obviously three of the achievements are hidden and I may or may not have gotten them, but I certainly beat all of the chapters, so that's just strange and annoying.\n\nOverall I am at the very least glad to have tried it out. It was worth that much I think, but as with all things, ymmv. I'm sure I'll mess around with it a little more but I can't see that adding to or changing anything I had to talk about. All in all I give it a very tentative reccomendation.","September 8, 2015","true","5.6"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","28","33","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyTenjoin/recommended/382300/","LadyTenjoin","LadyTenjoin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyTenjoin/","983 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAnyways, what I’ve written here is my evaluation of the game as it stands now (July 30th, 2015).\n\nKidnapped is an indie horror game developed by Deceptive games. It is in the Steam Early Access program so the problems I will be addressing might be fixed in future patches. As it stands now, it is a fairly short game, with five chapters in its belt. It took me about 2 hours to “beat” it. It is written on the steam page that the developers have more to add so we shall see.\n\nWithout writing any spoilers, the game is about a man named Sebastian Lee. He was kidnapped and brought to a strange mansion that twists and morphs around him the further he moves inside. The eerie sounds like the faint giggling of children and the pitter patter of rain against the roof adds to the creepy atmosphere of the game. However, I never felt true dread as I traverse through the hallways of the mansion or any of the other locations I visited in the game.\n\nThe enemies have terrible A.I. path finding and not to mention, they are not as threatening as I would like. I had one of the mannequin babies (That’s what it looked like to me) just kept running against the wall, and I was right in front of it. The big burly man can appear behind and instantly kill you. Like he just teleports behind you, shoves his massive body towards you and hugs you to death (okay, in my head, I would like to think that’s what is happening). Let me just add that in the "Primary Features" of the game, it’s listed that “You are the hunted, not the hunter.” There is a quest in the game that tells you to hunt (sacrifice whatever. Peta will not be happy) bears, foxes, and stags (rabbits too but they’re rabbits.) Not to mention, you have a gun and can kill almost anything that stands in your way (ammo droppings are plenty). I didn't feel like I was the one being hunted. Really, you don’t even need to shoot since you can pretty much walk away unscathed during an encounter because the hostiles have terrible A.I.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=491146338\n\nEvery time you see the “Saving Game” pop-up on the screen, you know something is going down, lessening the “immersive” feeling of the game. There are also a couple typos here and there (mostly spelling errors in notes). They are mostly prevalent during  Chapter 1 but they are still present throughout the game.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=491157537\n\nI had some performance issues where the framerate would just tank at random times. My specs are GTX 970, i7-4790S, 12 GB of ram…so on and so forth. Anyways, I am more than capable of handling this game without any hiccups. It’s early access so I will forgive it…for now.\n\nWith all this said, I did find the story interesting enough to continue playing the game. The story is further explained through various notes scattered throughout the world. The narrator’s voice actor is very good. He adds things to the story we might have missed or just comments on events/objects that seemed appropriate at the time. There were a few jump scares that were cleverly placed and I wished there were more of those. For example, I was about to exit a child’s room (which in itself was a bit creepy already), and suddenly a soccer ball just whizzed by in front of me (a child was giggle in the background as this is happening). I loved that part. The puzzles were reasonable enough and I had some “aha! I figured it out!” moments that made me smile.\n\nAll in all, this game has so much potential and I might seem critical of it. At its current build, you should wait and see how the game develops and improve. I will recommend it for now, but buy it at your discretion. It’s not all bad. I only highlighted the things I found irksome in the game because I felt as though they should be addressed somehow. I’m sure there things I missed but this is what found.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\noh by the by, here's me fooling around in Kidnapped XD\nKidnapped Video","July 30, 2015","true","2.5"," 42 of 60 people (70%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","70","42","60","7","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/speedwerd/recommended/382300/","speedwerd","Speedwerd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/speedwerd/","2119 products in account","Kidnapped is a first person shooter with horror elements mixed into it, which should be avoided by any avid horror fan.\n\nThe first downside about the game are the controls. Your character moves really slow and gets stuck on a lot of objects, which gets frustrating throughout the entire game. The shooting in the game feels very empty and just boring. Enemies tend to charge you, but most of the time they end up getting stuck on walls and stairs due to bad pathfinding. There is no survival horror element to the game, as the developer provides you with tons of ammo.\n\nGameplay wise, the game is very minimal, repetitive and boring after the first chapter. Almost every chapter in the game consists of a fetch quest; collect X number of items to unlock a door or activate X number of statues to despawn a wall leading to the next chapter. What is really frustrating about these fetch quest are in one chapter, where you have to rely on the spawns of certain enemies, so you can collect a quest item they drop to proceed to the next level/chapter.\n\nOne positive element that this game had was the atmosphere; despite it not being a really pretty game, the sound effects (besides the owl that won't stop hooting) and lighting really set a decent mood for the game.\n\nStory wise, the game is really confusing and the ending makes you feel like you accomplished nothing; it left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nOverall, Kidnapped should be avoided, save your money and try a more expensive and well-polished horror game on steam, or even look into playing some Amnesia mods. My play through of the game was not enjoyable and felt like a tedious job instead of a fun, spooky game.","August 12, 2015","false","2.0"," 26 of 33 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","26","33","0","0"

A brand-new, Early Access, first-person horror title which...wait for it...actually looks like it may turn out to be PRETTY DARN GOOD!!  Will wonders never cease..?\n\nI'll admit to this being a bit of a premature review, as I haven't yet delved that far into the game's mysteries...but "mystery" is something it's certainly not lacking in!  How did I end up in this basement?  Why does the unseen narrator know my name?  Who's the big burly muscle-dude who stomps grumpily about in his underwear, and occasionally appears without warning to murder me?   Why does the architecture of this mansion keep shifting?  Why are there boxes of bullets lying about everywhere (especially when I don't yet have a gun)?  What's with all the creepy mannequins?  Why the obsession with all the old, kitschy pamphlets (I'm guessing the kinky dude is a frustrated interior decorator)?  Why does my character just assume that a knife which he finds in a  blood-spattered room with a pentagram on the floor is a knife used to SKIN people with?  And most pressingly of all, how the hell did this get Greenlit when there's a chance that it may actually, as I mentioned above, turn out to be REALLY FRICKIN' GOOD?!\n\nNone of which is to say that I don't have a few minor "complaints" at this stage.  The creepy muscle-man does seem to just "turn up" without much warning, and once he's on you, I'm not quite sure what you can do to defend yourself (at least until you get a weapon or what-not).  He also appears to just "run into" you, without actively using the knife in his hand to "stab" you, per se.  Furthermore, the lock-picking shenanigans perhaps seem a tad pointless, as your lockpicks appear endless in supply should you manage to break any (perhaps there's some bits later on where you have to perform under some kind of time pressure, but I can't yet rightly say).\n\nOn the whole, though, I'm really quite impressed.  It strikes me thus far as a messed-up mix of a haunted house yarn and (the Joel Schumacher film) 8mm...and that's just GOTTA be a good thing, in my book.  It's super-atmospheric, quite scary, and seems very well developed for an Early Access title.  This could well be one of the winners.  Let the "verdict" below reflect that while they may still have a little way to go, the devs don't seem likely to drop the ball TOO dramatically on this one...\n\n\nVerdict: 8/10.","July 23, 2015","true","2.0"," 25 of 36 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","25","36","5","0"

It's dumb as ♥♥♥♥, but whatever, it's a horror. Now that's cool, but as soon as you get to fighting enemies it's falling apart very quickly. I don't think it's a good idea to throw these random enemies in on the second level, just to make them completely disappear for the rest of the game after. What kind of logic is that?\nThen you get to a forest to shoot animals. Really? The idea itself to just shoot random, completely normal animals in a horror game is bad enough, but when the hostile animals are unable to move, so you're free to shoot them makes it even more ridiculous. You get a pistol with dozens of ammo to shoot 15-20 enemies (counting the animals) in the entire game. I had like 80 bullets left, it's so badly designed.\nBut hey, the game tries to be clever sometimes too. The only problem is that the "puzzles" are so simple that it takes no effort to solve them.\n\nIt's just flawed in too many levels, I get that it's indie and stuff, but it's clear that no care was put into making this game. It's like they ran out of motivation after the first chapter, which wasn't nearly as bad as the rest of the game.

On average, this game ran at 15-19FPS for the most when I play it. It's not unplayable, but combined with the sluggish, clunky controls, I was moving at a snails pace throughout the gameplay. This game is poorly optimized. At the time of this review, the game is updated to version 1.4.4.; I ran this game on a computer with:\n\n8GB RAM, Win 7, Intel i7-2670 CPU@2.20GHz, Nvidia GeForce GT 540M 2GB DDR3 card\n\nGiven the information, this is more than enough to run this game at MAX but I still had frame rate issues. Turning off background programs didn't help either. It's just a poorly made game which is a big shame because underneath the bugs and all the flaws, there is a great game underneath. I really wanted to like this game. The atmosphere is chilling, the background music gives this sense of paranoia like you are being watch. And there are a few scares along the way. And the graphics are really nice for a game with for much exploration. Although one of the biggest problems with this is that there is no map for this game which bogs the game down a bit before it's easy to get lost if you don't remember your surroundings.\n\nWhat really made me stop playing this game was that the achievements are bugged and poor enemy AI. This was the breaking point for me where I had to stop playing. i was done with this game. Do I recommend this game? No or at least not now. For right now with all the flaws and bugs, I give this game a 4/10. I really do want to love this game but I can't.","August 26, 2015","false","4.9"," 19 of 32 people (59%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","59","19","32","6","8"

There are some interesting things going on with the map layout changing itself up now and then, but these instances are few and far between and not used anywhere near their full potential. Even if they were more common I feel as though whatever explanation we’d be given for it would be the same flimsy nonsense we already get. It’s an interesting premise on the very surface of it, you’ve been kidnapped, is it black market organ harvesters? A white slavery ring? The Illuminati? Nope, it’s a dude.\n\nSort of.\n\n---SPOILERS AHEAD, FOR WHAT THEY’RE WORTH, SKIP TO AVOID “PLOT”---\n\n\nLet me break the story down for you, real quick: You wake up with a hangover in a stinky room. Why? ♥♥♥♥ it, you’re the Chosen One for some reason. (No, seriously) Who actually kidnapped you is a question without an answer as the main antagonist(?) of the game has grown to three times his original size and is now a hulking pink monster with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for a face and a rather shapely bum. I’m not saying he couldn’t have kidnapped you, but he might have caught a few sideways glances as he walked down the street, rope and duct tape clutched in his pink, taloned hands. I don't know, I guess a dark ritual did it. That seems to be the explanation for a lot of things in this game. Once you escape the basement you are confronted by a door locked tight by a circuit board, because that’s an efficient locking mechanism now somehow, and you’re off to hunt up all five circuit pins needed to open the sesame. What follows are some almost interesting bits involving mannequins that are actually just mannequins, a shy piano playing ghost who makes exactly one appearance, a house that occasionally changes its floorplan, and some notes about an ex con with mommy issues and a love of vintage print advertisements, as well as the discovery of a dark secret hidden in the elaborate tunnel system that resides below the house. Oh, yeah, and a pair of haunted, somewhat inconvenient, two-liter bottles of soda for some reason.\n\nOnce you have the pins you enter the basement and are quickly attacked by one of those poseable wooden artists dummies and wake up in a cave.. There’s a chase scene, you find a gun with a poorly thought out reload animation and poke a few magic statues for some reason before being booted into a big spooky forest. There are houses here, presumably owned by the vertically challenged given the height of the doors, but inhabited since there are cars in the driveway and lights on outside, but for some reason you’re too good to knock at the door and ask to use a phone. You wander around aimlessly, slaughter and skin some animals (for some reason) before ‘sacrificing’ them at altars. Clearly this makes giant statues clip up through the ground and allows you to go to church.\nWhich is locked, it’s abandoned, there are plenty of broken windows, and I’m sure there are other potential ways in, but you’re not about to break and enter, you have to find the key which, for some reason is hiding under a grave marker. Spooky noises happen and then you head over to a shack that’s made of T.A.R.D.I.S. and much, much larger on the inside. But as we all know, you have to drop your weapons before heading into a place like that, it’s not like you’d possibly need a gun in this situation.\nYou walk and solve a "puzzle", then walk, "puzzle", walk, "puzzle", (Please note the quotation marks around the word puzzle) walk, walk, find a new gun and die.\n\nAt the very end you’re rewarded with a slideshow talking about how much Sebastien meant to everyone (Forgetting the fact that nobody named Sebastien could ever have friends) and how the legend of his journey will live on.\n---END SPOILERS, WAS IT GOOD FOR YOU TOO?---\n\nThe game can be summed up by one phrase which kept appearing in this review: For some reason. You’re kidnapped for some reason, a guy’s a demon for some reason, you do things for some reason, I bought this game for some reason. There’s really not much beyond that, and I’m generally pretty forgiving of games, if the gameplay is rubbish I can usually find something redeeming in the story and vice versa, but this one? I can’t even recommend it for the inevitable less than a dollar sale price. It is bad.\n\nOh yeah! Achievements don’t work, (for some reason) and don’t seem to have since release.","March 11","false","6.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game has a pretty good start with putting you in a haunted house that sometimes changes depending on whether there's light or not. It's a fun mechanic and I was really getting into it. Then you get the pistol and learn that both "shoot" and "use" are bound to the same mouse button so if you try to use something quickly and aren't -exactly- on the prompt, you waste a bullet. Not a big deal for the first level, but once you reach the caves you may as well throw in the towel. There are doors with a use prompt that even if you try to open them, you end up firing your pistol instead.\nThen the following level is filled with hostile enemies that you can run from but will always know where you are whether or not you have your flashlight on, and if the previous level made you waste rounds, this one has you wasting rounds from the start BEFORE you get a task that requires you to hunt some of the same hostiles for puzzle resources. In other words, you can waste all your ammo and kill some necessary creatures that you need before you get the level task, thus dead-ending yourself or at least making completion near impossible and it isn't due to user incompetence.\nThere's potential here for a cheap fun little horror romp but until the game has been heavily patched I'm going to have to say "avoid". It's a shame, because the start of the game showed a lot of promise and fun ideas that get tossed by the wayside as you progress.","August 13, 2015","false","1.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I'm only on the first chapter but there's suspense, random spawns, puzzles and you don't have a clue where you're going, one minute you're heading down a corridor and you just end up in some room that you've seen before. It's a good mix of puzzles, suspense and so far some slight horror. BUT... there are some bugs, from what I can see though the developer is actively fixing them and considering he's a lone developer, in my opinion he's done a great job. I'll carry on playing and hopefully it get's better!","August 15, 2015","true","0.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The graphics are pretty decent, though some textures are a little blurry and the developers seem to have over done it with some of it's spectacular / normal maps, which make some of the textures look much too "gooey" than necessary.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVXL1fpnj8I\nThe gameplay from what I've played is mostly a "walking simulator" with a few pop scares and an eerie atmosphere to go with it. The game does throw some pretty interesting curve balls that I thought was the highlight of my experience. From cleverly designed hallucinations, or the map changing organically as you explore the game, it did a good job at keeping my attention. The game also gave me a bunch of bullets as I explored, which I would assume there would be a gun and combat at some point. In my 50 or so minutes of play I did not encounter any combat or have found a gun, though it'll probably show up later on.\n\nPlease take this write up with a pinch of salt, as I've mentioned I only have a very limited amount of experience with the game so far. If you want to see that experience, above, I have a video posted of my play through. Hopefully the gameplay I recorded will help you decide if it's worth your time and money.","August 21, 2015","true","0.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The first door ahead is locked and you must scour the clutter around you to make your way out of your makeshift prison cell.\n\nAfter examining the contents of the room and discovering that you can interact with many of the objects around you, you'll come across a bobby pin, a screwdriver and a wrench.

My first (and currently only) playthrough took 1.5h and the first chapter around 35 minutes.\nThe game begins and you think "Wow, feels a bit like Amnesia", but soon you'll realize it's not even close.\n\nThe game tries to be dark and unnerving, but after a while you have seen everything.\nFrom the beginning you're allowed to examine pretty much every item that comes your way. You can spin them around and look at the items from all angles, but it is completely useless feature. Every item of importance will be picked up and anything else is there just to confuse you.\n\nThe first chapter was still rather interesting, since there was a lot of stuff to look at, papers to read and some events. The first chapter was also the one to ruin this game.\n\nYou're put on a situation where something happens and it looks like you need to find a way out or die, but end up being teleported to safety at the last second. The second time something happens, you'll just casually look around and then wait to be teleported to safety. It simply stops feeling like a horror game at that point.\n\nThe 4 chapters after that are what you'd expect from an alpha release game. The enemies are bugged. They walk a straight line towards you, meaning that every little thing will stop them. You also can't hit them on their heads, since their hit boxes are around the middle of their body.\n\nI also noticed for the first time on 4th chapter that you can reload. Apparently your magazine is big enough to hold all that ammo you conviniently find lying around.\n\nAlso, sound and music that hurt the players ears aren't scary, but rather annoying.\n\nThe game wasn't really that bad. The last 4 chapters and all those extra items just felt unnecessary. Almost like they were simply added at the end of development to increase the playthrough time.\n\nI'd recommend getting this from a sale, since personally, 6.99€ felt like too much for this.\n\nP.S.

This game was clearly not play tested.\n\nIf anybody recommends this game to you it's because they hate you and do me a favor and punch them in the mouth.\n\nI understand that making a game takes a lot of effort but there was so many glitches of getting caught on edges of environment that didn't make sense, or trying to run just to suddenly stop moving. Also, at some chapter you have to skin animals for some reason and I didn't realize this was a thing because animals continued to run at me but then they would just run away.

You know someone at least put some effort into this game, but this is by far the worst thing I've played in years.  Basically, the backstory is you've been kidnapped by some musclebound, meatheaded freak and you must escape his mansion and the surrounding areas.  The game showed plenty of promise in the mansion area but that's far as things go.  Once the broken shooting mechanics and numerous gameplay glitches kick in, you're in for a miserable slog.\n\nThe game has promise at first.  You must escape from a basement and find your way out of a lunatic's mansion.  There is light puzzle solving, killer use of light/shadow, items to find and notes to read.  While you feel threatened, I never encountered the muscle guy but in one scripted scene.  I was literally never killed in the first half hour or so of gameplay, which made the game a rather threatless affair.  Still, the exploration and setting was mostly fun.  The graphics aren't big league good but they do a great job of painting a foreboding atmosphere.\n\nIn the game you can pick up and interact with tons of items, yet most are useless and serve no function whatsoever.  Hell, a few of the items you add to your inventory don't even have a use!  It all becomes a bunch of clutter for an inventory system that you didn't even need to use in the first place.  At first the game has a feel like Amnesia/Outlast but that soon dissipated whenever I didn't even get killed by the monster at all.  The atmospheric sound effects of breathing, swelling and dark mansion ambience do at least give the impression that something is waiting around every corner...\n\nAND IT'S ALL DOWNHILL FROM THERE, BABY!\n\nAfter you beat the first level you end up in a cave system with a gun.  As many have said the gun mechanics are broken beyond belief.  The gun shoots when you try to open doors, shoots when you unpause the game, shoots when you read a journal entry, etc.  I wasted tons of bullets on absolutely nothing.  It doesn't matter because the bullets are plentiful, the enemies are a joke (not even scary at all) and crumple like paper and it's all just stupid.  Anyway...I continued onward...\n\nI made it to level 3 the forest and FELL THROUGH THE GROUND REPEATEDLY.  My game even saved falling through the ground and I'll have to literally start over to see if the glitch doesn't happen again.  The several minutes of the level I did play were spent shooting foxes, bears and deer, that weren't even threatening.\n\nThis game absolutely sucks, the developer gave up on it and I will seek a refund.  Ugh, let's break it down.\n\nPros:\n\n-The first level showed promise\n-Solid ambient sounds\n-Decent graphics with light/shadow looking really nice.\n\nCons:\n\n-Once you get a gun it's all over (BROKEN gun mechanics)\n-Achievements for Steam don't unlock\n-Numerous glitches like repeatedly falling through the floor\n-Terrible monster A.I.\n-Terrible monster design\n-No scares or threat beyond the first level\n-Can't finish the game\n-Developer is nowhere in sight and ran off with our money\n-LOUSY\n\nThis game sucks.  There's a reason for the mixed reviews and even $2.44 was too much for this broken, lousy piece of crap.  I'm actually pretty mad about it.  I thought since the reviews were mixed I'd give it a try because I love horror games and was hopeful I would fall on the positive side of the spectrum, but I am here to warn you this is the worst thing I've ever played.\n\nRating:  1/10\n\nComplete, pathetic garbage that doesn't even work and the developer made tons of promises that weren't fixed!

Very amateurish and bugged.  It is poorly optimised so stutters horribly whilst not looking great at all.  The run button is ridiculously useful, I kept having to look down to make sure I was pressing the right button, such is the similarity between walking and running in this game.  And when you're forced to retread over old ground constantly to figure out some obtuse puzzles (I'm pretty sure I accidentally cleared an obstacle in the latter part of the game by opening and closing a deskdrawer...), it breaks the flow horridly.  What starts as an interesting premise quickly squanders whatever interest it has garnered.  In later levels you end up wandering around a very boring forest shooting animals to sacrifice for some reason.  I liked the addition of notes scattered around but most of them didn't add much.  The voice acting, whilst not brilliant, wasn't the worst.  Though I would question the script he was reading from.\nAll in all, don't waste your time, look for your horror thrills elsewhere.  The game is too annoying to be scary.","October 16, 2015","false","1.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You can tell there was effort put into the attempt and I like how positively the developer responds to criticism. But ultimately I couldn't get there. The game has very little tension, relying on the occassional jump scare between bouts of extended exploration/item collection (which I understand is one of the mechanic focal points, but I just didn't find interesting enough). There are too many bugs, which really takes away from the fear that the enemies should inspire (hard to be afraid of the enemies when they all bunch up together and stumble against each other in a small corner while you safely pick them off with your gun). So ultimately I found it a dissapointing experience. Still, there's potential there and the positive attitude of the developer leads me to think that they will improve with future projects, so are worth giving a shot in the future.","August 26, 2015","false","1.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I wouldn't play this game if I was paid to do so.  In fact, I wouldn't be able to, because of its serious lag, terrible gameplay mechanics, and inexcusable controls.  I couldn't get past the first room (lockpicking with zero direction or hint that you're doing it right)  But this game's real difficulty is trying to quit out when it crashes (the game, not the computer).  I tried opening task manager, I tried logging out of my computer, I even tried ctrl-alt-del (all worked, but the game kept overriding all attempts).  I had to actually pull the plug from the wall, and when I rebooted my computer, my entire desktop was turned around (all my icons were reset to the standard left corner of the screen).  Even my Steam settings weren't right.\n\nI've never had a game act that way before - even weird boggy home brew games from GameJolt (and elsewhere) never did that.  And I PAID for this game - officially through Steam.  The least you'd think it could do is give you the most minimal basic gamepley, much less open and shut down without forcing you to do a hard reset.  The worst part is that I had some Word documents open that were not saved (luckily, there was a temporary save for it, so I didn't lose too much).\n\nI saw the bad reviews for this, I was warned, I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt, because I love horror games of all sizes and shapes (except the action-horror games which are repetitive and dreadful).  I did buy this while it was on sale, so I guess that's the only saving grace.  But this clearly needs more time in the development room - $6.99 for an unfinished game.  Should've bought Sonic Boom - at least in that one, the faults and horribleness are humorous and entertaining.\n\nCan't wait for Kidnapped 2 to come out - maybe they'll fix all the bugs, so that when you start it, it just automatically quits, saving you the agony of trying to do it manually.","October 11, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I also got mad when I had to restart my game when one fo the circuit pins got bugged and diseapered or something.  But what makes me really mad that I spent money on this game is terrible gun mechanics.  I go into the options menu to try to figure out how to holster my gun, after losing so many bullets clicking to use the door, which clearly says I can use it, but instead of using it it shoots.  I go into the options and see that there's no controls, not changable or viewable.  So then I exit controls and the gun shoots AGAIN.  I found out the hard way that every time you click anything in the menu and go back your gun shoots.  After realizing this fact, to just laugh in my face, the gun shoots one more time after I click exit.  What the ♥♥♥♥, how can this be on steam and expect people to pay money for it.

The soundtrack was repetitive and dull, the "scares" were incredibly cliche and I didn't so much as flinch when they occurred. The antagonists? Comon guys.... the only thing less scary than the AI was the story. First off, the narrators vocabulary sounded like an amateur storyteller who had no idea how to weave in and out of a story, and keep the audience engaged.

It took only an hour or so, once i figured out that the circuit in the 2nd globe had bugged out and not appeared for whatever reason. I restarted the game and pretty much just face-rolled through it. The objectives and puzzles were extremely amateur, as was the "combat". The animation of the creatures and animals were extremely poor and their death animations were so bad I actually giggled, breaking the small amounts of tension peppered throughout the game. I do not know what the game creator's intention is with Kidnapped, but if the intent if to simply fine-tune this shell of a game, I'd have to advise anyone to not waste their money. This isn't a game. It's more of a "fun house on rails", and the fun house has about as much quality as you'd expect from a traveling carnival.\n\nOne positive note: the music and creepy sounds really deliver. It's just about the only thing providing any tension in this game, so I tip my hat in that respect.\n\nIt's not worth $5, and turned out to be a very dull, poorly realized game with decent ambiance, horrendous game play, lame story, and puzzles that took mere seconds to figure out.\n\nSuggestion: While playing the game, I couldn't help but wonder how cool this game might've been, had it been a sandbox/survival game.
