"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FunnyFarmF/recommended/254100/","FunnyFarmF","FunnyFarm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FunnyFarmF/","222 products in account","This game is amazing, even after a decade of existance. While not very appealing visually, the gameplay is fun and solid. The tanks operate off of an armor basis. As in all but the lightest vehicles cannot be harmed by small arms. Tanks with lighter armor will suffer much more damage from tank shells than a tank with heavy armor.\n\nThe amount of units surprised me, as there are almost a dozen different infantry squads, as well as almost two dozen tanks and armored vehicles for each side (excluding the French Resistance). You can also realistically build up your base of operations with MG nests, AT bunkers and more.\n\nI sometimes question if the enemy AI are actually trying to kill me or just exploring and happen to find my base, but then again, it's very advanced for 2004.\n\nFinally, you have the ability to call in aerial reconnaissance, a light bombing strike, or even carpet bombing. There's even stuctures and vehicles that can counter these strikes.\n\nOverall, I still find that this game can fit well in modern games aside from the graphics.\nDefinately buy this if you have the spare cash.","July 3, 2014","true","6.7"," 49 of 58 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","49","58","3","0"

Perfect if you want to have a small, not too engaging game that wishes it was a real RTS when it grows up.\n\nFor instance - everything in the game has auto-aim so they always hit if the target is within range, so if you battle a tank of the same class as yours then it's basically a quickdraw contest of who shot first, then watch for a few seconds before the loser explodes.\nThe infantry in the game had to be somehow balanced not to be utterly useless so they did that by making them absolutely immune to tank shells, even if they score a direct headshot with one; they can only be killed with a machine gun, which is also an excuse why a machine gun even exists in the game (there are no trenches or any strategy, infantry is ALWAYS in the open).\nYou can also call in an airstrike in the game but that's also balanced by making the bombs dropped by the planes have just about the same impact as a loud fart.\nThere is no recon/stealth mechanics so if the enemy is within your shooting range it means they can see you the moment you open fire.\nEach nation has basically one super tank that is basically the ultimate doom machine and there is honestly little to no point in investing in anything else, so you can just spam those. It has absolutely no disadvantages, other than the slow speed (but you're not in a hurry anywhere), and the enemy can only make a scratch in its armor if they have a tank with a similar class of a caliber (so either they also get the doom tank or some other out of the very few ones that can make a dent in its armor, only to quickly realise they wasted money because their own armor is s**t).\nDue to having to build a base near one of the few spawn points scattered around the map the enemy ALWAYS knows where you start the game and where your base is (even if you capture another spawn point others can just see it anyway).\nThere's one unbalanced situation where each nation has a supertank for $15k, but the Germans have one more tank with EXACTLY the same stats and much cheaper.\n\nStill, I love this game. <3","March 29, 2014","true","1.1"," 53 of 74 people (72%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","72","53","74","6","2"

This game is neat, but in no means a good game.\n\nThis game has major flaws and problems. When I played it, I felt that I both loved it and hated it.\nSo Imma gonna start out with da good stuffs!\n\nThe effects- I love these effects, They kinda remind me of golden eye 64. After a devastating explosion there is fire and smoke everywhere, and I LOVE IT. So good destructive effects give me the feeling of the real chaos or devestation of a battleground. BUT, these effects go away like all good games have them do. I really do like fires on a battle field or smoke always lingering. I dunno, that's just me. The thing that gets me that you can have an entire area get blown up, but when you look back it's all gone and the landscape is back to normal! It might have been system or budget limitations so I dunno. Not an expert on de subject.\n\nThe idea- This game does kind of remind me of C&C Red Alert. You gain resources by garrisoning factories, mines, and some other stuff. I like what this game tries to do, I think it is pretty neat. In another sense it reminds me of Company of Heroes. Why? Because IST WW2. Am I gonna expand on that? Nawp.\n\nThe units- These units are both pretty cool and completely useless. FOR EXAMPLE. The infantry. The infantry serve one purpose and one purpose only. TO COUNTER OTHER INFANTRY!!! Here is the catch. This game makes you use infantry as you would in a real military strategy. Seeing in further detail how NONE OF THE TANKS HAVE MACHINE GUNS. It might be a blessing in disguise. Alot of RTS games allow you to defeat your enemies with tanks and armor alone. This game does not give tanks or vehicles a machine gun that has a cannon as it's main weapon. IT MAKE NO SENSE. Maybe it does, I dunno. But here is the thing, Tanks are massive mobile killing platforms. As with many advantages, there comes with some disadvantages. Tanks, (Especially in WW2) were very clunky and primitive in the sense of infantry protection. The germans tried many things to keep rockets, grenade, and mines from destroying the hull of their heavy expensive tanks. They do have these units in game, such as mine clearing tanks, tanks with balistic plating only used on later german tanks, and self propelled guns. They are all usefull in their own ways. But when you are in a cramped steel killing machine with only so many ways to figure out what is happening outside of the tank and infantry can easily sneak up behind or beside a tank and easily destroy it. They use infantry to fill in the gaps. That is what this game tries to emulate, but it is done poorly to the point when all my infantry is dead or being distracted by some enemy units. MY TANKS ARE DEFENSELESS. Of course they will turn to attack in turn, but the tank shells do pitiful damage. WHEH?! I dont get why tank shells dont do more damage. The same thing with tanks. The king tiger on the training level that you get, gets to attack about 3 T34-76's. Each taking about five shells, maybe even more. I feel that in a real scenario, A tiger would eleminate all of them if they had a fair set of distance between eachother. The duels between two tanks dont really feel like fights of skill or determination or even superiority, but as to my suprise, they are just slugging matches. The fire at eachother until someone wins game. DRUNKEN BRAWLS ALL ROUND. I think I has made my point.\n\nWelp, I think that is all the somewhat good things I have to say about this game. NOW LETS GET TO THE BAD.\n\nThe animation- honestly, graphics, not a problem with me. Models? Good looking models do help with the over all game.\nAnimation? Yes. Animation is a must. Without animation the game feels lifeless and empty, but in a game like this, animation is not needed to be as crucial or prioritized in an RTS game. In games like action games, RPG's, shooters, fighting games, sports, or anything else for that matter. In first person shooters you need to know if your character is reloading his weapon. So, as it would occur, you hit X or R if you will see a reloading animation. Is kinda hard to figure out if ya character is reloadin his gun if you cant tell if he is or not on the screen. In this game, animation is minimal. Is this a bad thing? Nah. But is it a good thing? Never. Without animation in video games, you lack the feeling of impact or explanation. This is what happens in this game. Especially the infantry, *Shudders* the infantry... The infantry move WAY TO FAST, and that animation does not match that speed. You know that there is a great game called Blitzkrieg. I am gonna talk about the first one. Maybe because it is the best one in my opinion and it felt like the most strategic of the series. The infantry in that game moved incredibly slow, which in turn encourages you to use mechanized vehicles to transport your infantry. In this game. There is infantry carriers in this game, but they in turn are unbelievably weak and cannot even hold a full team of infantry. SO WAS DA POINT. In addition the soldiers felt more like robots than humans...\n\nThe maps- This game has alot of maps. A suprising amount of neat maps I might add. Here is the catch with this one. Alot of these maps dont apply to the way the units in this game move. There are alot of mountains in this game, and the path finding in this game makes all the units hug the walls. I dont know why? It's not the shortest route, it's just plain stupid.\n\nThe AI- This AI might be aware of the state of their insecurities and immediatily wish to declare a truce on the battlefield. I am not kidding. Other than that, the AI is pretty standard.\n\nThe UI- This is in no doubt what ruins this game for me. The User Interface on this game is despicable. Every thing feels clunky and unfinished or rushed. The UI feels more user hostile than friendly. It doesnt lighten up the fact that a certain other thing I hate about this game. The map doesnt make sense either. How your units are represented on the map is very difficult and impractical to me. I would continue but then I would have to do the next point so here we go.\n\nThe camera- Now that I think about it. This camera is the worst thing about this game. There is some options for this stupid camera, but I dont think it helps out alot. The camera is really hard to explain. When you rotate the camera by holding down the mouse button. The camera moves, but not the map direction. If you have had experience with RTS games. There is a normal white square or something along those lines on the map that indicate what direction the map is facing and what you can see from both perspectives. Of course this game does it, but poorly. It isnt done by the white rectangle but by the way you are facing the map will get brighter from what you see. This does help in some cases, but a few of these maps are in the snow. AND THAT DONT HELP MEH. Now, to get where I am coming from. You have to understand how to play a RTS. How I like to control my forces is from the highest view possible as from a bird's eye perspective. Well, this camera pans straight down. I no like. I dont feel like it is preference, but when the camera pans down the I cant see what I want my troops to attack or advance too. Here is another thing. The camera doesnt feel free. It doesnt feel like it wants to cooperate at all times, like it should. When the enemy attacks me, I want to jump to the place on the map that the enemy is attacking. Combined with the bad camera, hard to use UI, and everything else cluttering ontop of your game. IST NAGHT FUN.\n\nBut I digress. There is tons of things that I could say. It might have been lack of budget or system limitations. Here is where the game gets me. I like the effects...\n\nEffects+\nIdea+\nUnits+\nA bunch of cool little things+\nAnimation-\nMaps-\nUi-\nCamera-\nAi-\nA bunch of other things-\n\nIn the end. This game is normally on sale. It is dated fun of some kind. I have had plenty. GOOD DAY.","September 18, 2015","true","2.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

I do not know what it is about these games all the way from Age of Empires 1 to Company of Heroes 2.  For some reason the skirmish against the AI is what I play more than the missions.\n\nIt is odd though, in skirmish game I played, the King Tiger is cheaper than the Tiger 1 and after the first battle battle,  the enemy 2nd wave included a  JS 3 tank on the Russian side!  My pzIIIs scattered!  At theis time I'm playing meduim difficulty.\n\n2nd skirmish with an AI ally and a T34/85 is in the 2nd wave attack.  The AI stole my initial recon vehicle! They killed the crew in the initial exploration attack and crewed it before I could send guys up there to man it!\n\nAlso the supply, if one calls for supply to  top off their tank and then moves  that tank, it seems the supply truck goes to the first set of coordinates to drop the load, so I had to learn to move ammo dumps closer and not confuse the supply truck by not moving my  tank after calling for it.  Also it seems the supply truck will auto supply units after ammo levels drop past a certain point.\n\nVehicles can be captured, an enemy armed car was abandoned and I took that, and the AI got even by snagging a motorcycle I lost and could not recrew.\n\nThe best part I liked about this game is calling airstrikes.  It seems easier to understand and more satisfying than say Company of Heroes.  Maybe it is the scale of the map and sprites, anyway click on an airplane then target and the airplane in a few seconds will fly over to it and drop its bomb.  If it strikes generally that vehicle is KaBOOM dead.  If the tank moves in the meantime though, it seems the plane will drop its bomb at the spot it was, it may not follow the tank or drop it on a neighbor.  If one can save enough money, a good carpetbomb airstrike with heavy bombers (He-111's on the German side) will really mess up an enemy blob.\n\nRuns fine on\nWindows 8.1 64bit (bootcamp)\n2012 Imac 27"\n8 gigoRAM\nGTX 680 MX","September 18, 2015","true","15.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In big nutshell this game sits on Alpha earth 3 engine. If you never played old earths, then run before you will write sh***y text about this game.
