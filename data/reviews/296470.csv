Neither of us were trying to win the game (bridge builder).  We were pretty much on par with one another skill-wise in the beginning.

It blew up as a really popular game where you play as muscle dudes and mount each other to be the person to go higher.\n\nI had this game ever since it launched, but never had the chance to play up until now and from what I played I only see a party game, something to play with friends over drinks, so you can tons of fun. Playing solo is pretty boring.\n\nThe game has tons of modes like climbing, mounting and collecting coins, or diamonds. Even though it sounds like a lot of variety, pretty much all game modes are the same.\n\nThe controls for keyboard is terrible, but the game outright says that you need an Xbox controller to play the game with. Playing with a keyboard is possible, but it's stiff as ♥♥♥♥ and I highly recommend not using the keyboard.\n\nThe game is only fun with friends, cause playing solo is really mediocre. It's fun for a bit and gets tedious after a few hours.\n\nOverall, I can recommend this game only for people who can have a few friends over, pop open a few cold ones and play this game as a party game, for solo play I can say it's not worth it.\n\nFinal Rating:\n6/10 - Only worth it to play with friends\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about this review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","March 15","true","2.2"," 29 of 40 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","29","40","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UncleNoggin/recommended/296470/","UncleNoggin","Gun_Shy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UncleNoggin/","134 products in account","This game is fantastic, but I must issue a warning:\n\nPlayer creativity and practice is an absolute requirement.\n\nSome people say the game gets old quick, and that it's too simple to squeeze enough enjoyment out of it to make it worth the money, and that d!ck jokes aren't funny. Those people are wrong.\n\nWhen I picked it up, I liked it, and it made me laugh my ♥♥♥ off for a bit, but I wasn't quite hooked. Then I played a match with someone who was REALLY good at the game, and it showed me the potential for hilariously rewarding gameplay and growth through raw skill. It actually exercises your brain because you have to figure out which keys you need to push next, and in which order, while you're helplessly rag-dolling through the air.\n\nSometimes it can be a little buggy, but honestly, that's part of the fun, and the bugs don't break the game by any means. And even if you don't get very good, the real reward comes from the awkward, flailing movements that still, after 60+ hours of play, occasionally make me laugh helplessly.\n\nWhat I've learned is that this game has two crowds. One crowd, who picks the game up for an hour or two (or less), and decides it's kinda okay, but too simplistic for their sophisticated tastes, and who still laughs at d!ck jokes anyway? And then there's the other crowd who gives it a chance, really learns how to use the mechanics, has a total blast and falls in love.\n\nNow, there are obnoxious jerks who play online, that think they're funny, and waste your time slapping your tender bits until the timer ticks all the way down. But just use that as motivation to get good at the game so you can beat all those jerks, and eventually they'll go away, because chances are, they're part of Crowd #1. And anybody you like playing with, look up on Steam and add them, and after a bit, you won't run out of people to play with.\n\nI give this game 10/10 hellicoptering dongles.","January 16, 2015","true","247.8"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","17","20","3","1"

That being said, the art-style is actually pleasant. It is very smooth, and uses curvy textures (Holy ****, this review is going to be filled with innuendos...).\n\nThere is not much more to say about the visuals, other than the fact that you are literally sitting and watching naked, sweaty men mount their friends.\n\nAudio: 2/10\nThe music in Mount Your Friends is horrible. There is one song, that repeatedly loops (And to be honest, the track isn't quite that good.).\n\nThere is also one sound effect. That sound effect is the slapping sound when you use your arms and legs to climb onto another player.\n\nGameplay: 7/10\nIn Mount Your Friends you use your WASD keys (ABXY when using gamepad.) and your mouse (or Left stick on gamepad.) to move your limbs. There is a bar that remains on the top of the increasingly large pile of naked men. Your only job is to climb on the rest of the players to get above said bar. You get eliminated if you don't manage to reach the bar. Your goal is to be the last person left in the game.\n\nThe game has online multiplayer, but you won't get the best experience if you don't play with friends locally.\n\nTime/Money: 7/10\nI'd say that this game is worth every penny if you have gamepads and people to play with. You could buy 4 copies for the price of three and give them to your steam friends, but I think that you'll get a better experience if you play locally.","September 12, 2015","true","3.8"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","14","15","5","1"

Gameplay is quite fun, geared a lot toward playing with friends either LAN or with voice-chat. You can also play online, or singleplayer to improve your skills.\n\nOver the xBox Live version, the PC version of this game has plenty of new game modes not in the console release. Additionally, if you so choose you can in fact use your controller. (This is actually recommended by a splash screen when you start the game.)\n\nAgain, swinging dongs is not the main point of the game. I saw the dev comment at one point, he made the game for fun, but when he showed it to his friends they payed a lot more attention to the core gameplay than he ever thought they would.\n\nSo yes it does have quite a bit of humor when playing with friends, but the gameplay is also something to be appreciated.

I think this is a game where naked men climb onto a goat to escape the police after robbing the store of all of its zucchini. This makes sense, because they have to stuff the zucchini in their pants because they didn't bring a bag to carry it with. This puts it firmly within a PAYDAY-style environment, where many naked men work together to commit crimes.\n\nBut why rob a supermarket for all of its zucchini, you might ask?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dipshiet64/recommended/296470/","dipshiet64","Ekans","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dipshiet64/","51 products in account","The main casualty of advancements in online gaming has been local co-op. We all have memories of convening at a friend’s basement or room and playing games together while screaming about screen-peeking, cheat codes, and all other manner of sore loser-isms. Developer Stegersaurus Software Inc. shares those memories and made Mount Your Friends as a callback to the glory days of old. Needless to say, Mount Your Friends is definitely a much more explicit game than anything we played growing up. Never in my life did I expect to write this sentence but the dong physics are second to none.\n\nThe first thing you notice about Mount Your Friends is the gang of Speedo-clad, Diglett-looking bodybuilders that you control. The premise of the original mode of the game is simple enough: each player has 60 seconds to climb on top of an ever-growing pile of the other players and get as high as they possibly can, with whoever tops the pile being the winner.\n\nThe challenge comes from the control scheme. Like the Assassin’s Creed franchise, each of the four input buttons controls one limb. Hold down a button and move the joystick to swing a limb; once you release the input button, if you are touching a surface, that limb will adhere to that surface and won’t let go until you manually move the limb again.\n\nClimbing the tower of muscular flesh can be easier once you figure out how to fling yourself from limb ledge to limb ledge, but until then you’ll find yourself slowly climbing up with all the grace of a newborn giraffe. However, this method runs the risk of either under- or overshooting your target and finding yourself flopping through the air until you splat onto the ground. While playing this game with friends, you find yourself either cackling like a madman at their ineptitude or malevolently planning on how to smack the controller out of their hands while playing it off as an accident.\n\nIn addition to the original race-to-the-top mode, there are a myriad of gameplay modes for both single and multiplayer. You can race to see who can traverse a rocky obstacle course and collect the most coins, make a bridge across a chasm, or even a freestyle mode without a timer to see what flexing muscular shapes you can build.\n\nThe music in the game is just as well-designed as every other aspect of the game. While playing a head-to-head game, the music takes on this epic feel, as if climbing this mountain of digital flesh is as grand as traversing Middle-Earth. I half-expected Gandalf to pop up as the next climber I controlled. If you pull off a particularly long climb, you hear your character stretch and strain to get that last bit of height.\n\nAs a multiplayer game, Mount Your Friends is as hilarious and entertaining as they come. Unfortunately, the single player mode gets old after a while. It’s not that the game is boring, but without playing against someone to challenge you, the game loses its appeal. Luckily for those without friends nearby, Mount Your Friends is playable online as well as with a local competitive co-op. There are global leaderboards for those who want to push themselves to keep climbing, but most of the fun comes from watching your friends struggle to climb above the human obstacle you put above them.","January 26","true","2.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DiceeciD/recommended/296470/","DiceeciD","Never Let It End","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DiceeciD/","173 products in account","There isn't much to Mount your Friends. It's a quirky competitive game where you use physics and sticky hands and feet to climb and fling yourself to the top of the tower made up of all the other players. Every player mounting the tower makes it taller until eventually someone wins. It's really simple, well polished, but really fun to play with friends.\n\nSolo content is available but it's not too interesting and without enemy AI, it's mostly challenges such as climb one of several given obstacle courses. Multiplayer is the preferred choice if you can grab some friends to play with. You'll be hard pressed at times to find anyone else hosting a public game. Customization is also an option, you can use some of the preset stuff to customize your team or import your own images for the body and head. This is a really cool feature that me and my friends have been abusing to import ridiculous looking characters into our game. The downside is they don't work in multiplayer, only you can see them unless you share the exact same picture with everyone else you're playing with. I'm hoping the devs patch something in to fix this but until then, the best solution is packing everything all your friends are using into a zip file on dropbox and just pass it around to all your friends.\n\nMultiplayer has 2 Gameplay modes and 2 Variable Weather Effects that change the gameplay. Vertical climb is a simple climb to the top of the growing tower of friends. Horizontal is the same but the tower must extend to the right of the screen instead of the top. These two games modes are accompanied by Space and Storm weather effects which change the physics somewhat to challenge you. Space gives you low gravity, which makes jumping and flinging yourself around easier, but also more dangerous. Flinging yourself too far on Horizontal can lead to falling into the pit below and instantly losing, while in Vertical, you can accidentally fling yourself off the tower which spells doom for most situation. Storm halts your progress by always pushing you to the left in a windy storm. This makes it hard for everyone to move or climb and flinging yourself is a lot harder.\n\nOverall it's quick and easy fun, you can kill time playing it or have a game night with friends, flinging off of Bill Nye in a Bra to achieve your victory. While the Single player content is lacklustre, Multiplayer is fun and worth the money if you have friends to play it with.\n\nAt £4 it's an easy purchase, unless you really need that £3.99 Whopper Meal.\n\nYou fat monster","August 3, 2014","true","7.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's ideal for both the casual player who is looking for some laughing fun and the expert who wants to compete beating scores on the leaderboards.\n\nIt offers several game modes for both single player and multiplayer (online and local coop) where you face very different challenges (highest climb, longest run, collect coins, etc.) by controlling the sticky body.\n\nThe aesthetics are remarkable but the heads and bodies are customizable and there is even a 'safe for work' mode in case you find the original skins a bit too spicy ;)\n\nPlay multiplayer to split your sides, learn some techniques and make a fool of yourself; or play single player to practice or compete on the leaderboards. As it's physics based, there is always room for improvement, you never master it completely.\n\nThis is one of those games for a lifetime (and it's only $5 !!).","January 2, 2015","true","23.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","7","11","2","0"

Super Meat Boy was a platformer, where a controller really was an upgrade... but here? Here, I sort of think it works pretty well to use keyboard and mouse.\n\nThe controls are 80% of the game. The rest is learning the physics and planning where to put each figure.\n\nMastering the controls is the real game here. And it's a challenge, but for the right reasons. It's strangely fun, at least for me.\n\nAnd you can pick a safe-for-work mode if staring at mostly naked men climbing each other somehow isn't for you.\n\nUltimately, this is another of my recommended 'minute' games, where you can play and get something out of it in the few minutes between having to do the next chore or bit of homework. Not a complex game, but the simple challenge of the controls and climbing physics is enjoyable, and there's more to this game than the silly title and nearly-naked characters would lead you to believe.","January 11, 2015","true","15.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has different levels that you can choose from, so the mounting is not always the same. However, with it only being six different levels, it can get a little repetitive. I would personally like to see more levels added. But other than that... It's hella fun! Also, the characters are customisable from skin color, to outfit, to hat, and face. You can even incorporate your own face or body using the template that is provided in the game folder.","August 31, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Really a simulated sportslike experience!\n\nSeriously, me and some friends (got the 4-pack) are having so much fun with this game already. Gave us loads of good laughs everytime we played it!\n\nOf course, the first thing you'll notice in this game is the graphics and animations. Especially those of the significantly emphasised manhood. Even after numerous climbs, I still find it hilarious! What in this world made the developers think of THAT?!?\n\nSo here are some (semi)factual pros and cons of the game:\n\nPro:\n- The physics are really well done and make quite a challenge!\n- Numerous game modes.\n- Allows plenty of customisations.\n- "Only once more!"\n- Visual style.\n- Hard to master (catapult!!).\n\nCons:\n- Graphics seem a bit oldschool (effective though).\n- Sometimes weird limb acting.\n- Custom heads and bodies have to cover the area of the stock heads and bodies. Otherwise, the stock graphics are visible (I tried to create a stickman).\n\nOverall experience:\nSo far, I enjoy MYF a LOT!

Super Meat Boy was a platformer, where a controller really was an upgrade... but here? Here, I sort of think it works pretty well to use keyboard and mouse.\n\nThe controls are 80% of the game. The rest is learning the physics and planning where to put each figure.\n\nMastering the controls is the real game here. And it's a challenge, but for the right reasons. It's strangely fun, at least for me.\n\nAnd you can pick a safe-for-work mode if staring at mostly naked men climbing each other somehow isn't for you.\n\nUltimately, this is another of my recommended 'minute' games, where you can play and get something out of it in the few minutes between having to do the next chore or bit of homework. Not a complex game, but the simple challenge of the controls and climbing physics is enjoyable, and there's more to this game than the silly title and nearly-naked characters would lead you to believe.","January 11, 2015","true","15.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Really a simulated sportslike experience!\n\nSeriously, me and some friends (got the 4-pack) are having so much fun with this game already. Gave us loads of good laughs everytime we played it!\n\nOf course, the first thing you'll notice in this game is the graphics and animations. Especially those of the significantly emphasised manhood. Even after numerous climbs, I still find it hilarious! What in this world made the developers think of THAT?!?\n\nSo here are some (semi)factual pros and cons of the game:\n\nPro:\n- The physics are really well done and make quite a challenge!\n- Numerous game modes.\n- Allows plenty of customisations.\n- "Only once more!"\n- Visual style.\n- Hard to master (catapult!!).\n\nCons:\n- Graphics seem a bit oldschool (effective though).\n- Sometimes weird limb acting.\n- Custom heads and bodies have to cover the area of the stock heads and bodies. Otherwise, the stock graphics are visible (I tried to create a stickman).\n\nOverall experience:\nSo far, I enjoy MYF a LOT!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smeeeth/recommended/296470/","Smeeeth","Handsome Squidward","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smeeeth/","157 products in account","Mount Your Friends was released in the absurd indie frenzy, alongside titles like Goat Simulator and Surgeon Simulator 2013. Mount Your Friends is just as nonsensical as those games, but also features simple and suprisingly addicting gameplay.\n\nIts a very simple mechanic; you control the appendages of your players, and you want to climb up a tower and reach new heights. At first the tower is a perched goat, but when the first player "mounts" the goat, he becomes the new vertical record, and then the bodies continue to pile up. By pressing the corresponding buttons for each limb, you "unsticky" that limb from whatever it was attached to and move it around to reach another ledge. Much like other physics-influenced games like QWOP, the controls seem unintuitive at first, but with a little practice you will find yourself flinging your character up the bodies of your competitors.\n\nThe single player modes are plentiful but barebones, which is to be expected. There is, however, a surprisingly large amount of multiplayer modes available in Mount Your Friends; the only problem is that they are all restricted to local multiplayer. There are virtually only two modes for the multiplayer lobbies (2-4 players); vertical tower building, and stretching horizontally to create a bridge. There are various settings you can mess with, but these are the only modes available online.\n\nAnother big feature of Mount Your Friends is the ability to completely customize your character. If you can create head-shaped images and a collection of images for the stomach, torso, legs and arms, you can add those to the Mount Your Friends custom directory and create a player from those images. But again, the games online functionally is limited because your competitors will have to have the same files with the same file names to see your custom players.\n\nWhen this game says a gamepad is recommended, it isn't joking. A mouse and keyboard are playable but you are severely limited in which acrobatics you can perform. You will become more proficient with 2 joysticks and 4 instantly recognizable buttons. I know where the WASD keys are, but it still takes me second to remember which one is which.\n\nDespite a few multiplayer limitations. Mount Your Friends is an exceptionally goofy and entertaining game with simple controls that are difficult to master. Buy a 4 pack when you can and enjoy it with a few of friends. Expect a solid 10 hours of fun out of it.","November 1, 2014","true","13.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
