Yes, it's Doom-like shooter set in fantasy. Awesome mix. Plus inventory.\nShadow of the Serpent Riders is a special patched release of a game that brings it to 1.3 version, thus adding two more additional episodes. No new game content like weapon or monsters or textures, just new levels. Think of Ultimate Doom.\n\nNow, let's tip apart the way that game was handled on Steam. Well. At least they brought the most full version of the game here. And it uses DosBox, which is usually a good thing until you find out how badly id Software configures them for Steam.\nThe game will lag at full screen, so you want to go to game directory and edit heretic's conf file to make it use "opengl" for "output" setting.\nGame's option like music device and controls is once again isn't easily accessed. On good side, they didn't remove Setup.exe this time around, unlike Doom games on Steam. So you have to open game directory, drag setup.exe onto dosbox.exe and then configure it as you want.\n\nStoryline of a game is quite simple. Well, it has a lot of written in manual, but main idea and amount of plot in game is minimal.\nYour hero is elven hero, who's name is Corvus. Elven race, guardians of the Pathoris world and keepers of Tome of Powers, were proclaimed as heretics, when Dragon Riders came to conquer this world. With two Dragon Riders leaving for the other worlds, the remaining Dragon Rider, D'Sparil, unleashes horde of monsters through portal after Elves manage to wipe out all of the human armies of the world. Most of the elves were killed, monsters took Tome of Powers for themselves and you are one of the lone survivors. Your journey will begin at the City of the Damned.\nSomebody will get murdered in the end.\nThe additional episodes 4 and 5 have excuse plot of "portal didn't lead you to home, so enjoy the world destroyed by Dragon Riders and the home of D'Sparil".\n\nPresentation-wise the game is quite awesome looking and sounding for it's time. Yes, Doom engine. But art-style-wise, Heretic presents the world that is dark fantasy yet very colorful, with great contrast. Setting is awesome, you get to wield a magical crossbow that is equalient to shotgun. While Episode 2 is a least interesting looking one, taking place in brown caves with lava, until it gets less dull with inclusion of ice in later level, Episode 3 brings an original setting of a underwater shrine and buildings. Even water in this game has that artsy look to it.\nMusic is great too. With medivel feel, it's not afraid to use modern instruments. Well, instruments of MIDI and Soundblaster. Most of them are melodic and catchy. Cathedral track will send chill down your spine for sure.\n\nGameplay itself is, surprise, Doom-like. You search and explore mazes at the running speed, finding keys and opening lcoked doors, pressing switches and discovering secret areas, shooting down monsters or rather rushing past them.\nYou will shoot down red flying gargolues, mummies, armor knights that throw axes at you, and dark wizards of D'Sparil, who will turn your blood cold with their backward speach that sounds like silly phrases. You will also deal with respawning "explosive barrel"-like things, will push yourself against streams of water and wind and will encounter bosses. Which are your standard FPS bosses. Being tough enemies that you will start encountering more often in later episodes. So not too amazing.\n\nThough, unlike most FPS, it does do something good: There are no enemies who use hitscan against you. What it means is that any damage in the game can be avoided, giving it more arcade-like quality. If forget that it still makes you run over damaging acid like Doom does.\n\nThere are seven weapons of magical nature. Shotgun-like crossbow, Rocket Launcher-like Pheonix Rod, Plasma-gun-like Hellstaff. With most of them shooting projectiles, they feel slightly too similiar to each other in use. But thankfully, game introduces Tome of Power.\nTome of Power is a item power-up that you will find through levels. By using it through inventory you will power-up your weapons for a limited time. It doesn't just make them stronger, it also gives additional properity for them, making them even more amazing. For example, mace, the final weapon, stops sucking hard. Hellstaff will make a hot magic rain appear over where the projectile collided. Gaunlets, the game's chainsaw, will start to heal you as well.\n\nInventory is another addition to gameplay. You will get to collect various helpful items that you can use it anytime. It could be Hourglass who work as timed bomb and aren't much of use, or healing potion, or invincibility ring, or, as said, Tome of Power. Not related to inventory, you also will sometime find armor, but it's quite a rare thing.\nThere is one important thing to be said about inventory: When you move to the next level, you will retain only one quanity of each item. You will also lose item that allows you to fly around. I am pretty sure that it may sound like a bad thing for some players. But I think it was a good idea. Most of us are used to stockpile tons of items so we could rush bosses down. With system like that, you should feel free to actually have fun using additional items during normal gameplay, you will lose them for no good otherwise.\n\nLast thing I should note is difficulty of additional episodes. Yes, episode 4 and 5 are harder. They are also more of same. And yes, the final level has eight Maloutaurs. But first levels of each of those two episodes deserve a special mention, as they will require you to think fast, use items effectively, avoid enemies you don't want to fight with in order to survive. It was really fresh challenge, at least on Normal difficulty. Got simpler after that though, as you gain more items in process.\n\nBut with all the positive things I said, I have to be honest, it didn't become favourite FPS. It's hard to explain why. But you see, the game just doesn't "click" like Doom does. It just doesn't. I am not sure what it lacks. There is something in game feel that it doesn't have. Perhaps there should have been more common enemies that die bloodily. Or maybe it's the projectiles nature of weapons not being comparable to shotgun and rocket launcher. But yes, it lacks something, hard to say.\n\nHeretic is an awesome FPS and yes, it's a Doom clone. But it's an awesome Doom-clone, perhaps bettering Doom itself for some people.","June 6, 2015","true","10.0"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","35","39","0","0"

This game is for people who played ClassicDOOM on DOS.  Released during the same era of gaming, rather than being stranded on Mars with only a space-pistol, you're a Heretic, cast out by your fellow man for daring to see the enemy for what they truly are.  After D'Sparil's armies wipe out your town, you creep back in with only a Wand, helltbent on revenge.  Like ClassicDOOM, this game originally came packed with three episodes, complete with frightening enemies, awesome weaponry, and amazing powerups.  Unlike ClassicDOOM, you also had the ability to look up and down and even fly.  Shadow of the Serpent Riders added two additional episodes, but as far as I can recall, no new enemies, weapons, or powerups; just new levels.\n\nThe game itself is froxen in time; the graphics have not been updated and I doubt anyone will attempt to do so.  As such, it is somewhat difficult to see in the distance on the better-developed machines of today.  However, this is my only gripe, and there's nothing that can really be done about it.  I bought this pack for one reason and one reason only: to return to my childhood.  Nostalgia.  To remind myself why I got into gaming in the first place.  And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.\n\nPeople looking for "new and exiciting machanics" will be sorely disappointed.  But if you remember the 90s, and ClassicDOOM, and Wolfenstein 3D, you need this in your collection.","June 22, 2014","true","30.0"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","4"

Although Shareware (the first level, The Docks, was all that you could play) it was one of the games I enjoyed playing, although it regularly gave me frights, with monsters popping out from behind pillars, and only the unidirectional roars to tell me that they "might" be lurking around a corner.\n\nI played it enough to warrant a full purchase via an unlock code, and the game proved to have a great deal of longevity. The stats at the end of each level, gave you feedback on no. of monsters killed, secrets discovered and items found. This lead to a great deal of replaying and backtracking to try and find each little hiding place.\n\nI never really read the manual, and the plot is really inconsequential anyway, this is by no means a narrative driven game, suffice to say your elven race was slaughtered as they refused to believe in the deity of the "Serpent Riders" and were slaughtered as Heretics. You, the sole elven survivor are out to seek revenge.\n\nToday it's legacy is questionable. The genre of Fantasy FPS, is non-existent, instead we have a modern warfare or sci-fi bias that the greater legacy games, Doom, and Quake popularized. Heretic is of course from the same  period. (It uses the Doom Engine). Yet has had far less overall impact on the trend of FPS fantasy, which is rather something of  a pity, as in an oversaturated market, this genre has potential. The only games that might have built from this core concept is of course Dark Messiah of Might and Magic (includes more brawling combat) and the recent Lichdom.\n\nIt has not aged well, the lack of resolution (it runs out of DosBox), poor textures and flickering lights may lead to eye strain, but the overall feel of the game is still enjoyable. It has none of the complexity and strategic gaming that later titles show, but it does sport excellent level design and exploration/puzzle mechanics, that aren't so common in modern FPS, as well as gothic interiors, and smooth gameplay.\n(Definitely a game to settle down to with some Death Metal on the side!)","September 26, 2015","true","0.4"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","0"

No no, those were 5 chapters, each of them with lots of stages. The game is indeed good, lots of secrets and has this dark ambient, creepy monsters, and awesome weapons.\n\nMy only complaint is that it wasn't configured to run on newer systems, so you should probably end up downloading ZDOOM to better customize the controls.\n\nAnyways, incredible game, totally worth playing if you enjoy old games","May 9, 2014","true","0.2"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

So this essentially is another FPS with significant new elements, compared to DooM standards.\nThis title puts us in the role of Corvus ( posthumous name given in the sequel), one of the last elves hunted by monsters from other dimensions, headed by D'Sparil, one of the Serpent Riders. Ok, like any other FPS of those times the story is completely useless, but in this case it's a very useful excuse to give the game a strong fantasy atmosphere. So there won't be zombies or devils, but Gargoyles, mummies, mages and minotaurs. There won't be guns but ther will be wands, ethereal crossbows and other magic weapons. There are more news compared to DooM: items. They're not just health powerups but they're proper items you may carry and use at your own discretion. These are the likes of health, damage powerup, teleportation in disguise of quartz flasks, Tomes of power, Chaos device... And many other items with different use. This kind of system seriously improves the gampeplay from DooM's standard, adding that creative spice to the classic "shooteverythingthatmovesandfindthekeyfortheexitdoor".\nAs in DooM, Heretic has three episodes made of 9 levels each. I was quite surprised to see that this release includes the other 2 expansion episodes from Shadow of the Serpent Riders edition which is a free upgrade I never heard about until now O.o (my bad).\nAs usual this game is released with DosBox to launch with. Fortunately they didn't even try to clumsily implement any mouse configuration as done in the horrible DooM releases.\n\n+++PROs+++ FANTASY. Clearly the prettiest innovation of the game is the fantasy atmosphere giving a creative new look to FPS. You explore buildings, which are not stations but castles or fortress with mosaic glass, while outside you find water and terrain. The settings obviously force the use of new type of weapons: magic weapons (my favourite are the necromancer gauntlets of course, the chainsaw equivalent... XD). And of course the implementation of new and innovative items.\nGAMEPLAY. Besides the ability to look up and down, there are other innovations and most of them can be grouped inside the new inventory system. Now you can pick up items to be used in other moments at will, and they range from simple health replenisher, damage bonus and other disguised as perfect fantasy items. One of the most useful and innovative are the "wings of wrath" a big name for a flying device, a new and important powerup considering you can't jump in this game. Another interesting is the Hourglass, which is just a powerful proximity mine. More possibilities means more fun.\nMUSIC. I have to point it: it's not as bad@$$ as in the DooM games, but it's very nice, and suits the atmosphere. I've made covers of some of these tunes too in Youtube... B-)\nMODS & COMMUNITY. You can find mods, levels and so on. But most importantly custom ports with graphical and gameplay improvement or guides, both in steam and in other sites, with tricks and advices on replacing DosBox with better ports and implementing the Steam Overlay.---CONs--- STEAM OVERLAY. As usual, like on every other old steam release running on DosBox, there's no Steam Overlay.","February 12","true","0.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

I played this game on a windows 10 laptop and the game worked perfectly fine for me. There is a link below to zdoom.\n\n\nWhat I liked about the game\n•	I thought the monsters in the game were pretty cool, especially the Golem.\n•	Throughout the game there are many secrets to be found.\n•	There were some very good levels, especially in the first chapter.\n•	Some cool weapons.\n•	I like the idea of having an inventory, so you can use stuff that you collect later on\n•	In the first three chapters, at the end of each level, I like how it showed you a map telling you where you have been and where you are going to next.\n• Cool death animations.\nWhat I disliked or was disappointed with\n•	I thought the music was quite repetitive, I know they reused some of the songs in doom, but they got reused a lot more in Heretic.\n•	Killing enemies in heretic wasn’t very satisfying. I didn’t feel like a badass like I did in Doom.\n•	The last two chapters aren’t really anything special, I like to think the story ended on the third chapter. The final         bosses in chapter 4 and 5 aren’t very interesting.\n•	Chapters 4 and 5 were quite hard, it was a shock because the first three chapters were very easy.\n•	Secrets were too easy to find.\n\nMy conclusion\n\nIf you liked Doom, Quake or Hexen. I would recommend this game to you. It is a good game with some good levels and weapons. Plenty of secrets to be found as well.

Would recommend to anyone who enjoys old FPS games like Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM, etc.\n\nGreat game!\n\nEdit:\n\nThis is an aside, scroll past this paragraph if you want to get on to my actual review:\n\nWhenever I first had this review I definitely wasn't out of my shell as I am now with my opinion and how I word things than I am now, so I think that I'll write a better review now that I can fully explain my thoughts without fear of someone not liking what I have to say about this game or any game whatsoever. People should consider the fact that whenever people review a game that's just what they thought of the game and it shouldn't actually dictate whether they liked the game or not. For instance, there was a game called Alone in the Dark which came out in 2008 and I absolutely loved this game. While I loved this game, the public seemed to not care for it whatsoever. I think that if you're able to get into a game that not many people like but that you like for some reason for another, that's wonderful because then you've actually achieved the ability to discern whether or not you like a video game based upon your own experience and not necessarily based on public opinion. It's nice to just think for yourself, you guys!\n\n\nOn to my actual review of Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders. So this is the first installment of a series which is also excellent called Hexen. You should definitely look into Hexen if you find this game to be interested. I'm sure that you're aware of Hexen if you've done your research on this game and you've played this game, etc. But Heretic is a DOOM-esque game (The reason why I describe it that way because that is a common ground that most people can understand) and it is primarily based around you being a magician or a sorcerer of sorts just killing baddies. It's like Shadow Warrior, Doom, and all that. Except this is more for people who enjoy fantasy games.\n\nNow with all this I personally don't think that there are many drawbacks in this game, because at the time this game was pretty top notch, whereas now people might look at this game and laugh. I don't, despite the fact that I did discover it past the 2000s.\n\nAbout this game, I would say look into gameplay videos to see what it's about, check out when it was published, and do research on it before buying it. I know that impulse buying is a vice of mine so that's why I say that in practically all of my reviews.\n\nThis game is definitely a change for more modern gamers and maybe you woudln't even be able to adjust to a game like this, and I totally understand that. I wouldn't blame you for not really wanting to get into something that modern gamers may consider "a step below" the dynamics, graphics and level of gaming that we are at now.\n\nHeretic does hold a special place in my heart and it is a pretty neat game. Look into it. Have fun with it.","October 12, 2013","true","10.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

I guess it's because it's the game I grow up with it and I find all the games of the series to be good. While I do love it, it's nice to see some people look at that game and not only make a good DOOM clone, but decided to add to it and make it better. So yes, I'm saying this is good already. Now let me explain as best I can.\n\nStory\n\nIt's a 90's shooter so there not much to talk about. From the synopsis from the DOOM wiki, three sorcerers called the Serpent Riders came and people started to worship their awesomeness. except for the elves who find the powerful monsters very suspicious. When two of the riders left, the remaining one gets his cult to hunt them down. As the world gets destroyed, one man decides to stand up and kill the wizard. At least it's a fantasy setting and not with massive guns for a change.\n\nGameplay\n\nIt's DOOM with a few new things so lets talk about those: For starters you have an inventory to store items like health packs or invincibility rings, which allow to use them when you need to, unlike DOOM when it's used when you touch them. The weapons are mostly the same from DOOM except no shotgun or BFG, but one power-up called the Tome of Power allows you to use a secondary firing mode, such as turning your lightning gaulents into a life draining weapon or turning you chaingun equal into a weapon that shots multiple mines on impact. So we have a inventory and weapon modes. What else is new. Oh, you can FLY!! But it's only used to find secrets.\n\nThe enemies are also a step up from DOOM. These guys are designed to kill. We start with some flying imps and golems that just scratch you, then we meet guys that throw stuff, then ones that shot three balls at the same time and then the first guys start shooing fireballs, and so on. And that's not talking about the bosses which are a league of their own. These are some of the hardest bosses I've seen in a shooter and freak me out whenever I see some. Sure the Cyderdemon was cool but he's nothing compare to the Maulotaur with his giant hammer, fire attacks and charge attacks.\n\nIf there's any gripes I have with the game is that the levels have a pattern. What I mean is that it's yellow key, green key, blue key in any level in that order. This cause the levels to be dull after a while.\n\nPresentation\n\nMusic is okay. there are some good tracks here, but they're nothing compare to anything from DOOM and start to sound the same after a while. The art design is mainly brown and grey but there's also a lot of blue, especially later in the game when we get to the underwater lair.Speaking of which, the Serpent Rider is everywhere. you constantly see his statues, his picture and symbol wherever you go.\nAlso, this is one of the goriest games I've played. Almost every enemies blows into tiny bits when kill. Sure other games have some prettying graphic kill animations but I could still recognize the corpse.\n\nVerdict\n\nIt's a good DOOM clone with several improvements. If you love DOOM I recommended giving it a try.\n\n8/10","April 24, 2015","true","3.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

After reading up on its plot and playing through the first few levels, I found myself thinking about this exchange from The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring:\n\nFrodo: It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.\n\nGandalf: Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment.\n\nYeah, this isn’t that kind of game. If you’re wanting to take part in some noble quest to bring peace and justice to a mythical world, there are dozens of RPGs out there that will scratch that itch.\n\nIn Heretic, some conqueror types destroyed your homeland. So you’re going to repay them by wiping them out. All of them. Every. Last. One. And when you’re striding away from the smoking, carnage filled ruins you’ll have the grim satisfaction of having balanced the scales.\n\nSo, it isn’t noble. Not a bit.

And... it shows it's limitations at times. Both from a stylistic point of view and the technical side of things.\n\nDoom was a lot of things, but above all else the game was very polished and it felt inspired. From it's soundtrack to it's enemy design, everything felt like it needed to be there. And it genuinely felt like the developers all had a central vision they shared for what the game eventually became.\n\nHeretic on the other hand feels like it's stuck in Doom's shadow. The game mechanics feel far too similar to Doom and the aesthetic of the game, while impressive for the time did not age well. All of the weapons in Heretic feel more or less like reskins of Doom weapons. Apart from the graphics it feels like the same basic game but with a much less interesting aesthetic and soundtrack.\n\nThe things I appreciate Heretic more are for it's historical context like how it was one of the first FPS games to come bundled with online multiplayer support, how it had a very large custom map community and how it serves as a prequel to the HeXen series. But I really only recommend Heretic on it's own if you're a Doom fanatic such as myself, since I unfortunately see the game as very forgettable.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=487092473","July 23, 2015","true","3.2"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","2"

With the episodes included and the varying difficulty settings along with an extensive amount of secrets to discover and expanisve dungeons to explore there's a lot to keep you busy. With that being said however, the game's atmosphere doesn't really stray from cobblestone-bricked castles, dungeons, catacombs and sewers. That's not to say that they're boring; a nice atmosphere of horror and Dark Souls-esque hopelessness is present here. It can just feel a bit monotonous to see recycled and similar-looking textures, battling the exact same enemies repeatedly with one or two more thrown in during each episode, and hearing the same music again and again. The overbearing use of grey isn't very appealing to the eyes either. With that being said though the maps are really big and sprawling with cleverly placed traps and treasure to run into. I'm also a huge fan of the crisp sound effects, minimalist but funny and charming voice acting, well detailed graphics and the designs of the enemies and environments which draw obvious influence from medieval art. You'll hear the same songs again and again but the songs are admittedly catchy and fit well with the tone of the game.\n\nYou can find more inventive and unique games for the same price so in my opinion it's worth having but wait until it's on sale; where you can most often get it for two dollars or less.","July 28, 2014","true","1.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay gives off that doom feeling (without respawning though those who plays Doom on nightmare mode), and the amount of enemies they added in the game is truly insane. This is something a hardcore first person shooter would have, intense action.\n\nThe game is quite fun and i would definitely recommend anyone playing it. Keep noted, the setup is not like modern games so make sure you know what you are doing. Otherwise, go search up on google or check the Steam community for some help. If you know any friends that knows how to do the setup on binding keys and disabling mouse movement, let them know. Its possible to modernize some controls, but remember to put in the keys that are comfortable for you to use and easy to remember.\n\nI mean at first i was like "meh" because of how it looks which put me in the "ok" position. But dang, after playing through certain levels with bunch of enemies, the adrenaline has kicked in and I went full carnage the same way i did in Doom. The game is fun enough as it is, and its hard for me to stop until the end.\n\nWill promise you the game will be fun, just remember to set up your controls properly and if you dont like mouse movements, theres a way to disable it.\n\nThis goes to people that likes something that involves fighting demons, ogres, and other creatures.

Not a bad thing though, the game is actually pretty good. I'd put it up there with DOOM as one of the best oldschool FPS games.\n\nPros:\n+The game is pretty colorful, from the enemies to the weapons to the stages\n+The enemies are pretty cool and none of them have hitscan, so most attacks can be avoided\n+An inventory system similar to Duke Nukem 3D, although one new edition is the Tome of Power - an item that upgrades your weapons for a short time, pretty fun to use\n+Big, well designed levels with lots of secrets\n+The music is okay, but nothing amazing\n\nCons:\n-The weapons are more or less just reskins of DOOM's weapons, but they also have a wider damage range, which means they'll feel inconsistent and sometimes underpowered.\n-The difficulty is a bit inconsistent, although there aren't that many cheap moments\n-The firemace is absolutely useless without a Tome of Power\n\nIf you like DOOM, there's no reason not to try this game. However make sure you replace dosbox.exe with GZDoom, it will make your experience a lot more enjoyable.","September 4, 2015","true","19.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thevicviper/recommended/2390/","thevicviper","The Vic Viper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thevicviper/","410 products in account","Short version: It's Doom, perfected.\n\nLong version: Heretic is, essentially, a professionally made Doom mod with a fantasy theme. In many ways, its status as a mod is obvious: the crossbow functions exactly the same as the shotgun, the Phoenix Rod is a rocket launcher, and so on. It plays like Doom as well: the game is broken into multiple episodes of 8 levels + 1 bonus. You go through collecting keys and finding secrets until you reach the exit. Killing anything and everything you can along the way, of course. Many of the items are similar as well: maps, invisibility, invulnerability, etc. etc.\n\nThis isn't to say that Heretic is just a re-skinned Doom wad. Heretic introduces brand new enemies and items. While many of the enemies are tweaked Doom enemies, there are new ones, such as the Iron Lich and the Ophidian. New items introduce new concepts, such as flight and emergency teleportation. Plus you can turn your enemies into chickens, and who doesn't love doing that? There is also the Tome of Power, which alters weapons for a short time. Some simply become more powerful, but others have different functionality. For example, the Phoenix Rod goes from a long range rocket launcher to a short range flamethrower, while the Gauntlets let you suck the life out of enemies.\n\nWhere Heretic really shines isn't the gameplay mechanics, but the level design. First of all, they are just gorgeous. Second of all, they are a technical accomplishment as well. The use of shadows and texture is excellent, which really creates a completely immersive atmosphere. You have everything from buildings, to narrow caves and alleys, to massive fields. The enemies are placed to work best with the current situation, so you always have a fight to deal with before you can admire the view.\n\nOverall, Heretic is a bit harder than Doom, though the difference between the very easy and very hard settings is enormous. On very easy, as long as you don't forget to pause the game before you wander off for lunch, you probably won't die, though there are a few spots where you can take quite a beating. On the highest difficulty, it makes Legendary mode on Halo look like a walk in the park.\n\nThere are only one issue: the game was made at a time when 800x600 was considered a high resolution. If you try and play it through Steam, you'll barely be able to tell what's going on because it's so pixelated. After buying the game, download ZDoom, which bumps up the resolution and offers a few other features. It's a free download and setting it up consists of copying the Heretic IWad file into the ZDoom directory.","September 28, 2014","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's all beautiful. Except for the enemies, that is. :p Now you may wonder why "1 hour?"...because of ZDoom, I can't run the Steam's executable so I added ZDoom's to my library. I played this game A LOT in my childhood along with many other FPS classics, hence why I find it all so beautiful, I used to be astonished and find everything just so amazing to look at when I was that young. Especially the water and the paneling on Episode 3. I must've spent over a week of gameplay in my life so far, I look forward to many more hours! Anyway, enough about my experiences, I ABSOLUTELY recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed Doom, old as the 90s' games, medieval FPSes, and I encourage everyone that enjoys FPSes simply because this is the best of both worlds. Medieval FPS that has an inventory system, (unfortunately, though, you only have one per item left in your inventory after each level's done which REALLY sucks) and its textures for the maps are just great for their age, so if anyone who's artistically interested in video games, this is one of them. Of course its old, but if you don't mind old then its great! Also has an alright replay value, its levels can be memorable, sure, but the gameplay doesn't really get old. Finish the game once, let some time pass, (whatever's necessary to make you forget how some of the levels are laid out) replay it again. How much fun, right?...but if you don't enjoy it that much then I dunno, must be my nostalgia goggles or something. :p Anyway, yeah, amazing game, (for its time? Nah, for all time. :p) lots of fun to be had, quite the cup of tea for those who enjoy (old, depending on who it is) FPSes.","March 28, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's all beautiful. Except for the enemies, that is. :p Now you may wonder why "1 hour?"...because of ZDoom, I can't run the Steam's executable so I added ZDoom's to my library. I played this game A LOT in my childhood along with many other FPS classics, hence why I find it all so beautiful, I used to be astonished and find everything just so amazing to look at when I was that young. Especially the water and the paneling on Episode 3. I must've spent over a week of gameplay in my life so far, I look forward to many more hours! Anyway, enough about my experiences, I ABSOLUTELY recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed Doom, old as the 90s' games, medieval FPSes, and I encourage everyone that enjoys FPSes simply because this is the best of both worlds. Medieval FPS that has an inventory system, (unfortunately, though, you only have one per item left in your inventory after each level's done which REALLY sucks) and its textures for the maps are just great for their age, so if anyone who's artistically interested in video games, this is one of them. Of course its old, but if you don't mind old then its great! Also has an alright replay value, its levels can be memorable, sure, but the gameplay doesn't really get old. Finish the game once, let some time pass, (whatever's necessary to make you forget how some of the levels are laid out) replay it again. How much fun, right?...but if you don't enjoy it that much then I dunno, must be my nostalgia goggles or something. :p Anyway, yeah, amazing game, (for its time? Nah, for all time. :p) lots of fun to be had, quite the cup of tea for those who enjoy (old, depending on who it is) FPSes.","March 28, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The old graphics are not the catch, nor is it nostalgy, but something that nowaday single player shooter games lacks.\n\nThe game map design and logic, allows you to go deep into difficulty, sometimes into puzzle, all in a linear story. There is a secret every corner, and some monsters simply endure several of your shots with ease. The combination of this work - i insist, specially the level design - is simply awesome.\n(Plus, the game lasts somewhat like 2:30h~3h each chapter, to a total of 12~15h of gameplay in normal. Try playing it on hard after it.)\n\nI first played it as a child, unable to do anything without cheats due to difficulty. I recently bought this game after giving up to search for a decent 1st person shooter, and rediscovered a masterpiece. (Which i can know how to play!)\n\nIf you don't care to graphics and controls, this is the game for you.

It's above average, good but far from great.\n\nThe main reason for this is simply put the level design. Possibly a fourth of my playtime consisted of aimlessly wandering around looking for what opened or what switch to push, a design choice decidedly "old-school", but nonetheless bad. DOOMs level design is infinitely better, because it will rarely (if ever) leave you scratching your head, wondering where to go next.\n\nThe weapons (with the exception of a few) are copies of weapons from DOOM, they just feel clunkier and are less satisfying to use. Enemies can usually also be correlated to some rough equivalent in DOOM, but most of them have been changed a little bit. The worst example of this is the Iron Lich (most similar to cacademons), whose whirlwind attack (depending on the situation) can be completely unfair, or completely useless. The best example of this are the Disciples of D'Sparil, who I can't even think of a correlation for in DOOM.\n\nAll that said, the art, music and sound in this game are all really great and create a forboding, dark and gothic atmosphere. If you're a fan of shooters from this era, you'd be a fool to miss Heretic. I would however recommend giving episode 4 and 5 a miss unless you're a masochist. They're not difficult in a fun way, it's just an excruciatingly slow grind of trial and error, possibly only surpassed by the likes of Final DOOM. If you don't like FPS of this era, this game has no chance of winning you over (I would recommend DOOM as a starter, it's still a great game).","September 5, 2015","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
