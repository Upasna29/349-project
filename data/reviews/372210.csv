There aren't many non-sarcastic reviews on here, so I really had no idea what was in store.\n\nThis is a freaking adorable little puzzle-platformer. The puzzles are pretty easy; find the key, open the lock, find the little girl and reunite her with the ghost. The levels have slight branching as you get further in, but not to the point where you end up lost. The music is really solid; even though there's only three tracks, they're pretty enjoyable. One of them is a bit startling, being louder and faster than the other two, but still surprisingly fitting. The controls are dependable and glitch-free, which isn't always the case in an indie platformer. Hit detection is actually spot-on, a welcome change from some of the other atrocities I've picked up on coupon. Really, my only complaint thus far is that I can't spend all those pennies I've been picking up. o.0\n\nThis isn't a hardcore game, but it's definitely worth what I paid for it. It's short (you can probably beat it in under an hour), but still strangely addictive. I opened it up expecting to play a few minutes, realized half an hour had passed and came here to post. So if you have a couple spare bucks, spend them here.","February 11","true","3.5"," 27 of 27 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","27","27","0","7"

They sent shivers down my spine.\n\nThere is no explanation, there is no dialogue, you start in the dark house and it goes from there.

We DON'T even HAVE pennies anymore in our country, so why is the cat collecting a currency that isn't even in use? To place on the eyelids of the dead? To pay Charon to cross the river of souls?\n\nThe graphics are scary, the music spooky, and the monsters... the monsters. I think the game is taking place in a crazed cat womans house and the undead cats you return to the grave are your fallen family.

There is no story unfortunately, but this makes it easier to just jump in and out of the action as you see fit. There are 19 levels in total which can be finished in about an hour, depending on your platforming skills. The movement and actions are very intuitive and easy to use/handle. Just dash, jump, and double-jump your way through the levels, while picking up coins, finding big keys to open locked doors, rescuing a few human souls, and avoiding or defeating enemies like zombie cats, mummy mice and flying vampire cats/bats. There are 2 ways to defeat the spooky/cutesy enemies: you can jump on them or dash into them. I haven't found a way to defeat ghost cats though, so I just tried to avoid touching them in order to sustain health points...","June 7, 2015","true","1.4"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

That was actually kinda a problem, beacuse I was on the 2nd last level within 45 minutes.\n\nIm not going to try to make this sound sweet, this game is short. Like, really short.\nIts also not scary at all. I love how the devs in the boss fight (If you can even call it that) Consistanly says, "dis game is so scawwy!!" It drives me nuts. Anyone who says this game is scary is either a crazy 2 year old or a liar.\n\nAny "Difficulty" that is in this game is from an insane amount of spikes. There is the one level where it is literally COVERED with spikes wall to wall. With the first one, you cant walk off without getting hit by the spikes. Later, they place 2 unkillable enemies in the places where you need to walkthrough. Meaning, you have to wat about 20 seconds to lure them out, then run through. Any illusion of diffuliculty is from the devs overplacing the unkillable enemies or over usage of spikes.\n\nThe introduction of trampolines, late in the game, is completly unesscary. Its used well on one level, but then completly forgotten. However, the level it was used well, was actually an ok one.\n\nAs for the level design, its simply a "Rinse and repeat" Cycle. Press a button, press another button, get a key, backtrack to the door, and leave. Or, sometimes you have to grab the spirit of some weird-looking doll thing, then bring it to a ghostly body of it, where it spins and explodes into stars. Not sure what was going through the devs mind at this point, but with a game like this I see they needed... Er... "Creativity"\n\nEverytime you hit an enemy, it goes slo-mo and zooms in. I mean EVERY TIME. In parts where you jump on many enemies heads, it gets quite annoying.\n\nNow, despite all these flaws, I still oddly found myself having some fun with this game. I kinda enjoyed it, in an odd, twisted way. Do I think it is worth the base price? Goodness no! Do I think it could be worth it for some weird fun at around 50% off? For sure. If you can snag it at a cheap enough price, go for it! You might have a fun in some sense like I did.\n\nThere is about the most honest review written on this game.\n\nHave a good one!\n\n-SpyroMan27\n\n","June 16, 2015","true","1.3"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","16","20","2","0"

And I'm even more of a dog person.\n\n======OVERVIEW======\nSomehow, still not sure how, I had a lot of fun playing Spooky Cats. And as I was reading other reviews, it seems like I'm not the only one. It is a short game, sure, but I guess adding more levels or some difficult puzzles/challenges would kill the momentum. I mean, I'd be more than happy if there were some more levels whether official or made by other players, but I would probably burn out of listening to spoooky cats (since they are 2 spooky 4 me... yeah, I'm a very funny person). To sum it all, the length is perfect. Other than that it's all just decent but still good nevertheless. Only the soundtrack was kinda "meh" for me but not a big deal, muted it after few minutes. What was absolutely brilliant though, the voice-over of dying bat. You'll get what I'm talking about after you play this. Anyways, one last recommendation - playing it with a controller might be a bit smoother and more fun, so if you have one, give it a try.\n\nPROS- cats (if you are a cat person)\n- length\n- trading cards\n- visuals\n- controls\n\nCONS- cats (if you are a dog person)\n- soundtrack\n\n======RATING======\nOkay, I have to admit this was one of the strangest experiences. I honestly thought all these positive reviews were sarcastic but I realised they are not afterwards. Not really sure if it's worth the 3$ price tag but some say it's a life-changing experience and hey, whatever supports the developer's goofyness, right?\n\nFor recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!\n","March 17","true","0.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

When I reached that point, I reduced the music volume and let it fade into my subconscious. Some players will have more tolerance than others.\nThe level design can make some spike/baddie avoidance frustrating. The spikes tend to be less forgiving, because the baddies move around a tiny bit and follow the cat you're controlling to some degree, whereas the spikes are non-mobile unless attached to a moving platform. For the first several levels and some of the seemingly-higher levels, you'll think "this is laughably simple. I'm not a toddler! That level was short and easy!" Other levels will have you agonizing over the struggle it's taken you to reach a save point only for you to lose your last life just before reaching the save point, so you'll be sent back to the beginning. That happened to me sometimes 2-3 times in a row... you'll be glad for save points at times like that. Especially if you've traveled to the end of an area just to retrieve a key for a door you needed to get through way back next to the spawn point.I got this as part of a bundle, and I'm glad it was included. Rather than the shovelware many bundles include alongside their "more reputable" purchase bait, Spooky Cats has great gameplay which will suck you in!\n\n.\n\nATTENTION! .:. ¡CUIDADO! .:. VORSICHT!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wordvirus/recommended/372210/","wordvirus","thewordvirus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wordvirus/","82 products in account","A lot of these reviews are obviously sarcastic. Here's one that isn't. Sure, Spooky Cats looks like a flash game and it's repetitive--but it's also easy to play, fun, cute, and affordable. The music is very adequate, though limited (3 tracks looped). Because of the simple graphics, even low-grade PCs can run Spooky Cats. My laptop isn't exactly a warrior and, sadly, quite a lot of games in my Steam library don't run well on it...so it's nice to have simple games like Spooky Cats (as well as more advanced retro titles like Hotline Miami, Eversion etc) that I know I'll be able to play.\n\nAnd most importantly--I grew up on platformers, so I have a keen eye for them. Spooky Cats is the bare basics in that familiar, run-and-jump sort of way, and that's not a bad thing. The controls are very responsive and glitch free, something I can't say for a lot of indie platofrmers on Steam. Don't expect Fez, but at $3 dollars you can't really go wrong with a title like Spooky Cats. It makes a great in-between game for breaks from those more hardcore titles.","November 10, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game play is easily for the hardest of hard-core gamers. It's so intricate and complicated that some people may be find it overwhelming, yet they balance it out by letting you practice your skills along the way with an endless continue system.\n\nThe horror elements of this game, don't even get me started! Let me tell you, this game is definitely one of the scariest games ever! It doesn't resort to ridiculous and needless jump-scares, it immerses you in a horrific and ominous atmosphere that will certainly keep you up for the next month or so! It's practically if Eraserhead, PT, Insidious, and Bloodborne all had a giant horror baby and put into one game.

A cute platformer with tight controls and solid level design that presents a perfect level of challenge. I don't think Spooky Cats will exceed anyone's expectations, but at $5 it adorably fulfill's it's promise of fun. I only have a few small complaints. While running around the mansion it's often hard to distinguish brown platforms from the brown background, when pressing switches it's difficult to tell what exactly has changed. Also, I wish the game only looped one song per level, rather than the entire soundtrack.\n\nPros\n-cute setting and graphics\n-tight controls\n-well designed levels\n-decent challenge\n\nCons\n-hard to distinguish platforms\n-looping soundtrack\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: Review is based on approx. 1 hour of gameplay.","June 15, 2015","true","0.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It's also a far more morbid hame than it appears. The controls are tight, kinda cute sound effects, but the biggest downfalls are the limited range flashlight effect used, and the amount of spikes later that make that mode of vision far more infuriating than it has any right to be. Worth buying if you have an hour to kill, but better off waiting for a sale than paying full price.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/QnSOYgtb_j4","June 24, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
