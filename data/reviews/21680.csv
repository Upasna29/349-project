It was the first game that had a swear and a gruesome scene of someone's head blowing up. For those that haven't played or heard of Bionic Commando, its a 2D gunning platformer with a world map and different, unique and vibrant levels with a wide variety of enemies. If you think you've done every 2D platformer before, have you tried a platformer with no jump button? This game really hangs its hat on the fact that you use a bionic arm for platform traversal. The arm is pretty versatile, the normal arm button launches it diagonally, when you use a direction and the arm it will blast out forward, and ducking while using the arm will send it forward, but lower. You can use the arm upward too. With the arm you can swing and climb. You can release the arm's grasp to drop and release the swing. In this version of the game you can grapple barrels, pick them up and throw them. Its a nice touch. You can also use your arm to counter bullets. Its a nice feature.\n\nWith the overhead map you and your helicopter pilot will fly around to different areas / levels. There are two types of areas. Combat zones and neutral zones where you'll talk with people, obtain items that will help you and club a prisoner with your bionic arm. The combat zones have been modernized while still giving them a vibrant, colorful feel that makes it feel like a game in a good way. The excellent old chip tunes have been modernized and they all sound good, but personally, I prefer the older tunes.\n\nThe combat areas have a two or three sections, usually broken up with a communication room that will further the story for you and open doors to the next segment of the area. So an outside area will go indoors, a towering spire will reveal the upper half of the spire when you use the communication room. You can also wire tap in the communication room and new to this version of Bionic Commando is a simple mini game that has you hurling a yellow ball in a three dimensional box. If the ball exits the box, then you fail, but there's no consequence for failing like the Nintendo classic where enemies would flood the room. The goal is to rotate the box and hurtle the ball to yellow blocks that will prevent the ball from going out of bounds. Its pretty easy and it breaks up the game. Its just extra icing on the cake. The game also has communication chips like the old game, so in certain areas you'll need to have the blue chip to communicate. The Nintendo version of the game had you pick a weapon, a communication chip and an item when entering each level. Thankfully this version lets you use all of your chips, which will spare you some time.\n\nAs for the weapons, to be honest, its a little underwhelming. You have your standard 2 bullets on screen revolver, a weak laser, a short range shotgun, a rocket launcher and a bouncing laser that shoots at an angle. The angled laser can shoot enemies hiding behind cover or above you, but since the game gives you so many other ways to kill covered enemies it seems useless.. The original Nintendo game had a 3 way gun that felt useful and the original rocket launcher would plow through enemies. Now there seems to be an emphasis on realism where the explosion of the rocket launcher will damage if not kill you. The rockets also wave, giving it a chance to miss. The shotgun does the same damage as two bullets from your revolver. The weapons just feel useless when compared to the simple starting revolver. You'll be able to change your weapons on the fly with the shoulder buttons, which again is a welcome tweak to gameplay from the Nintendo version forcing you to be stuck with one weapon the entire level. The most useful weapon not in the Nintendo version is a simple grenade. So you use 3 buttons, arm, gun and grenade throw. Its a good way to kill enemies behind cover.\n\nOn the map, your helicopter moves along lines level to level, giving you choice of where to go. The only catch is that convoys patrol these lines and if you run into one, you'll fight in a top down stage. Its nice combat diversity that doesn't last long. You can use your arm to whip away bullets, but each of these areas is over quickly. You can find easy lives this way.\n\nOne of the biggest changes from the Nintendo to the Rearmed version is 2 player co-op through the levels and also multi-player death match mode. They feel like good add ons, but for those that like the single player, the biggest change are the bosses. The original Nintendo bosses were more like enemy rooms with a core at the center. Now the bosses are giant machines for the most part. These machines take a good chunk of time to destroy, have different patterns and phases of the boss fight. Its a really nice change to the original. Plus, the bosses have some character and brief dialog before each fight. It adds a lot of charm to the game.\n\nAs for challenge, the game is easier than the Nintendo version. You can take more damage, you have more attacks and can use multiple items at once. There is no real consequence to the game like there was on Nintendo. There are unlimited continues, using all of your lives merely sends you to the map. The game feels easier and you can take more bullets before you die.\n\nIn later areas when using the arm on horizontally moving platforms, the arm is suddenly very flawed. It will let go quickly if the platform you are on is moving. Sometimes, climbing onto a moving platform will nudge you off the back of it. You can even run against the movement where suddenly you're running in place when the platform is moving to the left and you are running to the right. Or trying to drop off platforms will sometimes bump you back onto them. Toward the end of the game it turns into a fight against the game's mechanic on top of what can already be a forgiving arm hit detection that doesn't always grab onto things. A lot of the time the arm will grab onto something as its retracting. The Nintendo version had that flaw too, but it wasn't nearly as abundant as in Rearmed.\n\nFor children of the 80s this was a difficult game on Nintendo, but now it might run you 4 hours to complete. There are a few difficulties to chose from too. I can say that $2.50 is a good price for the game, but I have difficulty justifying $10 for a game this old that is really just a fresh coat of paint with some memorable bosses. The levels are quick and don't offer much challenge to veterans who have already completed the game 20+ years ago. There are a few new levels including the final level that feels excessively long. There are plenty of challenge rooms inside non combat zones where you're forced to get from point A to point B, but that's hardly an attraction. The game has in game medals, but no Steam achievements. After everything being said, I prefer the original and I think that the sequel to this remake is a better game, mostly because I felt like I hadn't already played it.","July 2, 2014","true","6.3"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","38","44","0","3"

Very fun and unique to have a platformer where you can not jump at all.\n\nMany people complain about the difficulty or "clunky" controls. The game is supposed to have very restrictive movement. It isn't a simulation of what it would be like to be a bionic commando -- it is a game first and foremost. Overcoming the strict control and movement mechanisms is the challenge, but can be very rewarding. Watch a YouTube speed run player and you'll see how fluid it can become once you master it.\n\nBe warned though: you NEED to have a controller. The game is *literally* unbeatable on Hard+. It is impossible to beat the end boss without a controller due to being unable to remap the keyboard to split rocket launcher control from character movement. Outside of the end boss the game is extremely fun.","July 5, 2015","true","14.7"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","0"

Tabloids","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198034823626/","440 products in account","I came here with the purpose of finding a game I didn't like and seeing if it was worth a negative review.\nGlad I came back to this one.  As it turns out, its a rough diamond.\n\nIts a jarring game to play initially.  We are so used to knowing what a shooter is and what a platformer is.  When a game like Bionic Commando denies us a jump button then it becomes very stressful.  My advice is do the tutorials and attempt the challenge rooms within the friendly zones first.\n\nThey will teach you the mechanics and you will quickly be able to move fluidly the way you want to and be a true bionic commando, instead of a slow clunky frustrated commando wondering what you are doing.\n\nThe swing mechanics of the bionic arm are very fun once you take a few minutes to get used to them, and you will be taking on platforms and bad guys with ease quickly.  You won't even mind not having a jump button after you've figured it all out.\n\nLevel progression is a bit different too.  Area 0 is a friendly zone that must be entered to find the tutorial, and Area 1 must be entered to find the challenge rooms that put into practice more of the advanced skills.\n\nYou won't initially know where to go, but by exploring the areas you can access you will eventually build up a handy arsenal of equipment and knowledge of the game.   I highly recommend exploring all the friendly zone to start with and entering the rooms to collect useful equipment as well as getting used to moving around outside of combat.  After you've comfortably explored the friendly areas and rooms, tackle the nearby accessable low numbered areas and dominate those enemies in combat.\n\nAs an example of a time where you will be initially confused, you need to explore a friendly zone to get the flares you need to more easily explore Area 4.  The level can still possibly be completed, but you will get frustrated wondering why an early level has you zipping about blind trying to find a random platform or bit of wall you need to succeed.  Turns out exploration of a friendly zone was the answer and only one I discovered by accident after getting frustrated and quitting out to try another stage.\n\nBosses are in every enemy stage, and there is a great mechanic where you can hack enemy consoles for a chance of learning the boss weakness.  I found the early bosses to be easy enough that I didn't get frustrated and wanted to keep playing.  Beating bosses earns you more gear as well as more levels to play with so its a rewarding experience.\n\nThere are also enemy trucks zipping about the world map also give you a chance to play a different kind of shooting game and experiment with weapons.  Its a bit repetitive, but a fun distraction between the main game.\n\nIn conclusion, Bionic Commando Rearmed is definitely a game that tries something different and succeeds.  If you can cope with it being different, put in that half an hour to learn how to play the game.  There is a real treat lying ahead for you.\n\nEDIT: I'll admit later levels and challenges do become frustrating so just enjoy the fun bits.","December 5, 2015","true","3.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

The level design takes heavy inspiration from the original but some of the levels have been modified, as well as many of the boss fights which can prove to be challenging if you lose your cool.

Bionic Commando was one of the very best games for NES, and remains a very fun game to this day. This remake is a faithful rendition of the old classic with updated graphics.\n\nI was wary when I first got this game, afraid they may have added new controls to make full use of an XBox controller. But that apprehension went out the window as soon as I started playing. The graphics look beautiful, I was stunned to see how good this old game looks with new visuals, and I was amazed to find they kept the old control scheme: D-pad (or left joystick) and just two buttons (A and B). To any of you who might be thinking "wow, just two buttons, OMG WTF???" you're missing the point of this game. It's old-school platforming fun, with a really good plot and great challenges that really make you think.\n\nThis is the kind of game I want my kids to play (whenever I have them in a few years). The mechanics are a bit frustrating at times, since there is no "jump" button, no "run" button, or any of the other frills you would find in most third-person shooters. Instead, you have just two buttons: one to shoot your gun, and another to shoot your bionic arm, which functions basically like a grappling hook. You can shoot the grappling hook in exactly 5 directions: straight left, straight right, 45 degrees up-left, 45 degrees up-right, and straight up. Though this might seem like a limitation, it's actually an integral part of what gives this game its challenge and creativity. Back in the day when this was programmed for NES, it was the pinnacle of gaming, and today, it's a wonderful challenge that gets better and better as you play longer and get used to the controls. The reason I want my future kids to play this kind of game is that it really forces you to think outside the box. For example, there are some areas that seem impassable, but with a bit of thought, you can jump off the platform, turn back and catch onto it, then swing past and catch another platform with a little bit of timing. Things like that are what makes Bionic Commando something unique in the world of gaming, teaching kids (or nostalgic adults) how to think outside the box and work with what you have to overcome challenges.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the graphics look great. It's not absolutely stunning, definitely not on par with Skyrim or The Witcher 3, but still very good. If you played the NES classic like me, then you will be absolutely blown away, but for people who are new to Bionic Commando, it probably won't stun you. There's nothing wrong with the graphics, it's just obvious that it's a minimalistic platformer. The tutorial reminds me of Frozen Synapse, while the main game looks similar to Valdis Story: An Abyssal City, but less cartoony.\n\nSpeaking of the tutorial, you really should play it when you get to it. If you haven't played Bionic Commando before, you'll need the time to get used to the controls, and if you have, you could probably use a refresher course, especially since you'll be using an XBox controller instead of the NES controller. Please, for the love of God, don't try to play this game with your keyboard. For one thing, I don't think you can get a true feel for the game without using a real D-pad and real A & B buttons, and for another, some of the reviews have stated that in later levels the key binding is messed up which is very problematic when you're facing a Boss Battle where one false move could spell your doom. I'm actually seriously considering getting a USB NES controller specifically for this game, but it works great with an XBox controller so there's no need for that unless you're just nostalgic.\n\nSound quality is excellent, I think it does a great job of staying true to the classic sounds while updating them to the modern era. The music sounds like a revamped version of the original soundtrack, and the sound effects are a perfect blend of just enough chiptunes to make it feel older, while still maintaining a level of modern quality.\n\nOverall, this is a spectacular game that I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of platformers or looking to try one. With various difficulty levels to choose from, it has great replay value, and it's simple to learn but difficult to master. $10 isn't that much for a game these days, and Bionic Commando goes on sale pretty regularly so I'd say it's definitely worth every penny.\n\nOh, who am I kidding? I can't try to write an unbiased review of Bionic Commando: Rearmed, this is a faithful remake of one of the first video games I ever played. It's awesome because I said so, now buy it and love it.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

I have poured hours upon hours into the Xbox Live release. That being said, this is a fantastic game. If you have ever played Bionic Commando, you owe it to yourself to play its remake.\n\nThis game is very difficult, unforgiving, and requires a lot of trial and error. It is not a game of this generation, or last generation. Bionic Commando: Rearmed is a refined coat of paint on top of a classic Nintendo game. If that's your thing, you probably already own this game. If it's not, you should run away as fast as you can.\n\nAside from difficulty, it seems a lot of the reviews are complaining about technical issues.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rancourt/recommended/21680/","rancourt","Dusty Rancourt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rancourt/","2088 products in account","Bionic Commando was a decent enough arcade action game, when it debuted in 1987. Cartoonish, tricky, demanding, full of genuinely vexing little obstacles here and there. Its NES port, technically a sequel to the arcade game, remains the gold standard "home version that clobbered its arcade counterpart" in my book, adding many more stages, many more enemies and obstacles, and some genuinely hair-bristling cruel and unforgiving claw-swinging physics challenges that made you feel really accomplished when you finally cleared them. Bionic Commando was the first NES game I finished, partly due to being a very late arrival to the NES world, but partly also because it was the first game I owned to seem, frankly, as though its unfolding story justified the work involved. I felt like I'd really accomplished something, the day I finally arrived at that endscreen with Joe's signature.\n\nRarely does lightning strike twice, in the way it did with Bionic Commando Rearmed. This is a really excellent remake and update of the NES version of the game. Everything you loved about the original is still present, with a significantly updated weapons arsenal (each with a collectible power-up elsewhere in the game), an entire system of "challenge rooms" offering difficult, timed obstacle courses to hone your skills with the arm, and, thanks to the greater room afforded for text and dialogue, a richer and more vivid telling of the story, affording better lines to the supporting cast, and a better sense of pace to the story told.\n\nThe shift from 8-bit "physics" to 2.5D simulated physics is surprisingly welcome. Getting used to the weight and flow of motion in Rearmed's world took less time than I feared, and as I reached later stages that my thumbs remembered intimately on the NES, I found the timing familiar enough for my "twitch memory" to be useful. The life bar is markedly more forgiving than the NES' "acquire life dots as you go" approach, and touching an enemy no longer results in a loss of life in itself, making it easier to climb onto some of those tricky, cramped ledges with an enemy soldier. There are some genuinely innovative uses of the tools at hand in BCR that weren't present in the original, too -- try firing the shotgun while hanging from the claw, for example, or firing the claw at an enemy combatant for a brief, if grim, human shield.\n\nThe stages have never looked so beautiful, and it's easier to understand their purpose, and the nature of the structures you're traveling through, in Rearmed. I even recognized the areas traveled in the original Bionic Commando arcade game, thanks to the higher-quality visuals, and was able to understand pieces of Joe's original mission from the things learned about those stages in Rearmed. Some of the goofier adversaries of the original game gain renewed clarity with the visual facelift, and become less adorable, more plausible. Fear not, though. Many of the goofy classic enemies are just as goofy as ever, some even more so.\n\nThe connecting arc from Commando to Bionic Commando, through Bionic Commando (NES) into Rearmed is stronger than ever. The overhead combat stages when encountering an enemy during transfer on the map screen has never been quite so beautiful, with multiple terrains, classic overhead action, and includes a new song on the soundtrack, "Meet The Enemy And Descend," that ties this game firmly back to Commando. (Listen carefully, and you'll recognize the chord progression of the Hubbard version of the Commando theme ever before the SID warbles accompany the analog monophonic synth bass.)\n\nThe soundtrack is quite nice, too. Pleasantly retro-squelchy without being preciously nostalgic, it thumps, sirens, howls and buzzes through the quite excellent NES melodies. "Advance With Caution," the game's main theme, remains my favorite of the tracks so far, with its glitchy, bitcrushed lead synth and occasional wide portamento sweeps, though its exhilarating pre-dawn SpecOps maneuver sibling, "Heat Wave," brims with the sort of potential energy I'd come to love from Jan Hammer's Miami Vice soundtrack work. If you're not deep into the game's mindset and stepping quietly with sidearm at the ready by the time "Killt's Hidden Treasures" plays, maybe this game just isn't for you.\n\nThe NES original was as nonlinear as it could be, given its system limitations, but thanks to the unlimited continue system and open endgame with all levels unlocked for unlimited replay, Bionic Commando Rearmed really encourages the players who've toughed it out and won to go back and try again, with new gear, new tricks, new experience. Speedruns, no-gun runs, creep-and-take-'em-all-out-unseen stealth runs, don't-touch-the-floor runs, difficult weapon runs, find-every-nook-and-cranny runs...this game really encourages you to replay its levels and explore it thoroughly. The weapons arsenal can be used to tremendous advantage; I found myself revisiting guns I'd dismissed as "useless," and discovering ways to really get the most out of them. (A master with the vector gun can do *amazing* things with it...) I'm seldom inspired to replay games I've completed, but I find myself returning to Rearmed, again and again.\n\nMy only real complaints have been that it's a bit short -- I would love to see Rearmed 2's levels released as a DLC pack, but they're currently a console exclusive -- and even with the relearning curve, I breezed through it, my first time, in under two  hours. That was a very respectable game duration for 1988, but by 2008, it seemed a bit short, a bit wanting for expansion, for later missions. I doubt it's going to see much new love, as it's an older title now, but nonetheless, that's really the only thing I found myself wanting for, in it. In fairness, though, I really did love the 1988 NES version, and I wanted this to be a very faithful, but slightly tweaked and improved, version of it. It is -- and if that appeals to you as it appealed to me, you're going to love Rearmed. If you're hoping for a dramatic update, it is, but if you're hoping for a dramatic departure, look elsewhere. This was, in my admittedly biased opinion, an attempt to revive the best damned platformer of the NES, and Grin seems to have treated its source material with all the reverence I would have wanted them to apply to such a legendary game.\n\nThis isn't for everyone: it's a very faithful recreation of a singularly unique NES game. But it is very much what it sets out to be, and that's a thing of real beauty in this day and age of weaksauce nostalgic property reboots. The only game like it that I've encountered was the remastered edition of Ducktales, a similarly brilliant and reverent resurrection of a past classic.\n\nIf you're been waiting to see the Albatross fly again...well, your number's up, monster. ;)","February 9, 2014","true","36.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/recommended/21680/","Anitude","Annie T. Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","A remake of the classic NES title that seems to stay very true to its core gameplay mechanics whilst also adding other content.\n\nPlays fine on a keyboard but a controller would probably be more recommended whatwith it being a platformer. The controller input isn't rebindable and there are preset control types the game allows you to use but the controls themselves should be relatively simple enough to play through with.\n\nDifficulties range from Easy, Medium, and Hard. From what I see Hard mode on this game overall makes it a bit harder than the NES Bionic Commando with its high number, damage resisting, beefed up enemy count and Spencer being able to sustain fewer damage.\n\nAs it goes like with the NES one there are two kinds of gameplay, its core platforming sections which is basically 90% of the game and the occassional top-down shooter sections. The top-down shooter sections are as occassional as before. When trying to select an stage you do so from a somewhat visually appalling-in-comparison mapscreen where you're a helicopter hovering over a numbered Area to descend to. The top-down shooter sections will only come up likely by chance because you happen to be trying to select an area to descend to from the overhead map and and an enemy truck on the map happens to come your way. It's still as basic as ever; top-down perspective, shoot anything that shoots back with its extremely simplistic controls (with the new addition of the movement via the analog stick) and style like with any other game of its kind. The usual end-goal exit has been replaced with a non-retaliating obstruction that you have to destroy. You can breeze right through these sections with little to no trouble especially if you've acquired a strong enough weapon or two. Used to be that the only good reason to do these top-down shooter parts is to collect obtainable Continues from specific enemies. This time around they're unlimited so there's no real good reason to actually make a forward attempt to go do these anymore although lives are still a thing but I'm not entirely sure if you can farm those properly.\nYou get 2 (or 3, I forget) lives by default. As tradition would go doing a proper job at staying alive and completing a level won't result in much inconveniences with starting a level over at a point especially if all lives have been wasted.\n\nMost of the mechanics & features in the NES version have made it here and work pretty much the same way, like the bionic arm still being able to block bullets if the action's performed right and only being able to respawn from the beginning of the stage & most doorways, specifically & especially the ones that enable access to boss doors.\nIts core mechanic is the replacement of a jump button/option to a bionic arm that allows you to grapple in 5 directions (←, ↖, ↑, ↗ →) onto platforms for either climbing or swinging likely consistently in succession. Learning bionic arm platforming may take a bit of time to learn fully and get used to but I thought it was pretty worth it when put to proper use. There are even some tutorial and challenge levels to help get a better handle with it.\nAt least on Medium difficulty and later, there are no longer any enemies that die in one hit with weaker weapons. You also have a health bar now as opposed to the squares that indicate how many hits you can take from anything. This also means that there are no longer any collectible "bullets" to pick up from killed enemies as the bullets have been replaced by obtainable Score Tokens and random health refills.\nA few items and weapons from the NES one have been replaced by many newer ones (weapons mostly) that are actually all very useful in the right situation as I never actually found myself picking favorites. Every item & weapon you acquire are now all automatically equipped with the ability to switch weapons in-game. You can find upgrades for each weapon however you'd have to put in effort into locating them as they're pretty much all hidden in secret areas.\n\nPractically all of the notable parts of every stage in this game are kept the way they are with some changes made for better or worse like complete scenery/atmosphere overhauls and other additions to prolong the stages a bit maybe. A few bosses have been replaced with more new ones to add variety in these fights one way or another they've been redesigned. In the later half of the game you'll have to fight most of them again in their upgraded forms. Plus, you actually have to fight them now because the choice to skip a fight altogether has been removed. The final boss fight too has been completely redone and now has his own incredibly long specific stage with the final escape still mostly being the way it is as it was.\n\nIt's just a personal issue but I didn't find the visuals & graphics & whatever the like to be all too appropriate with the gameplay but all-in-all I enjoyed it and thought that it pretty much played almost exactly and then some like the NES title.","October 22, 2015","true","8.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/0skulock/recommended/21680/","0skulock","Oskulock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/0skulock/","987 products in account","I'll start this review by simply saying that Bionic Commando Rearmed is the best platformer game on Steam, hands down.\n\nBCR was developed by a swedish studio called GRIN, they had previously made the Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter games which were "okay".\nBut in 2008 they really hit the motherload with this one, the game is an HD remake of the original NES game "Bionic Commando" and not does it only add more content to the mix, but even refines the original experience making it a superior version to the classic.\n\nIn BCR you play as Nathan Spencer, a "Bionic Commando" with a giant robotic arm that operates as a telescopic grappling hook you can launch in five different directions, making it perfect for flinging around like Spider-Man. (Or Tarzan, but let's face it, nobody thinks Tarzan is cool anymore.)\n\nBut there is a twist! You cant jump, the reason for this was originally the fact that the NES controller only had the A + B buttons which most games used for different actions. Shooting took the other button and grappling hook the other, meaning there werent enough buttons for jumping.\nFor this reason, the developers had to get the level design absolutely perfect for the game to work, and oh boy did they succeed. The level design in Bionic Commando is still one of the best in any platformer game still to this day.\n\nWhat about the music? Well simply put it's AMAZING, after finishing the game twice i dont think there is a single bad track in the entire OST of the game. Even the originals from the NES game sound amazing, but they really did the remastering well in this one.\n\nIf i'd have to give the game some criticism, (which is really hard btw) it would probably be the PC porting. While it certainly is superior to the other versions in terms of graphical fidelity, rebindable keys and proper sound settings, it's lacking an option for enabling vsync.\nThis doesn't sound so bad at first, but when you realize that your rig is capable of running the game in ludicrous speed (I had about 400-470 FPS during the entire game) it can cause serious issues with overheating in your GPU.\n\nAll in all, BCR is one helluva masterpiece of platformers and one of the brightest moments in Crapcom's history, if they only had hired these guys to remake the old Mega Man games...\n\nThe game sells for 8,99€ on Steam and for that price i can certainly recommend you buying it. The game offers about eight hours of gameplay, but that number might vary depending on how much you have played platformers before or if you wish to complete the challenge missions. It should also be noted that the game is a remake of something that was on NES, so the replay value is pretty much endless.\n\nLastly, GRIN was shut down in 2009 after their commercial failure with the new Bionic Commando game, (I'll talk about that a bit later) and because they had multiple projects going on at the same time, even though publishers were delaying their payments.\nMost of the GRIN development team went ahead to start a new development studio called "Overkill Software", sounds familiar? Yeah, these are the same guys who made the Payday games.\n\nOne last thing, the last boss of this game is Adolf Hitler, yeah.","May 28, 2014","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/21680/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","A good game with some jarringly stressful levels at the end, namely the upper swinging section in 11 where you have to be very precise and a slight mispress of the claw arm button, which your press only has to be off by a milisecond, means having to re-navigate the bottom section to get back up for another most likely unsuccessful try. Then you have the final albatros level. It just ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. The first part, your claw arm doesn't work half the time on some of the platforms in one section, an obvious game glitch, and the rest is just a pure stress test. If your doctor ever wants you to take a stress test, tell him no thanks, you have already played Bionic Commando Rearmed. The last albatros level is the worst level I have ever seen in a video game. It was so incredibly stressful and so bull-shi--y that I just got tired of it and gave up and uninstalled the game because I just stopped caring, never to be ♥♥♥♥ed with again. You get through three door tests that are stupid enough in their own right, then the next section has changing platforms and collapsing hook grapple points. I was laughing at how stupidly stressful it was and just quit and am done with this game. Such a shame, all that work for such a truly God awful last level.\n\nEverything is good, but it will take some getting used to for most people because it is a platformer without a jump button. The idea is that your bionic arm is so heavy that you can't jump but you can sure as hell use it to swing around the levels awkwardly and that is the whole thing that made Bionic Commando unique in the first place, since the original. Everything works fine and it is a challenging game so some things are going to be immensely stressful in the levels but it is do-able with practice. The challenge levels in particular are probably the hardest, most stressful things I have ever done in my life, Unfortunately a lot of the picky awful programming that forces you to have perfect timing in the challenge levels trickles over into the story missions. On the 10th challenge I had no idea how to swing up to do it until I checked a youtube video. Even after watching how it was done I still had no idea how to do it until I read some detailed comments under the video and even then I still pretty much did it by luck. I gave up after the second set of them. The third set of challenges just got too stressful. I have never in my life seen anything require you to be so incredibly precise. If you don't swing right even for a milisecond you fail. If you dont hit the button within the right milisecond you fail. There is quite literally zero margin of error in the challenges, but thankfully they are not required so I am just enjoying the story levels. The graphics are awesome, the music is superb and is the best part of the game, the weapons and enemies solid, the animations realistic, and the gameplay is smooth. The only real way the game could be improved is if the dumb overly picky swing section in 11 was fixed and the last level wasn't so nightmarishly bad.\n\nThe combat is ♥♥♥♥ing stressful as well because there is no recovery time so one hit and you are sometimes bouncing around like a pinball into other hits and you can either be killed in no time or be easily bounced off a platform and fall a long, long way down and have to reclimb the level which absolutely sucks. If only your guy wasn't such a stiff heavy snail with incredibly picky claw arm swing controls then it would be less frustrating.\n\n6/10, nothing but pure stress at the end. Get the 2009 Bionic Commando instead. The swinging in it is not done very well (gee what a surprise!) but it is not too bad and the game is still enjoyable but very short. The claw arm idea instead of a jump button is a very neat idea but it really should stay in these games and not be adopted by any others. Catch it (the 2009 3D version) only on sale though for $5 or less because it is a very short game.","November 29, 2014","true","6.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

So i scratched the lice off my head and pressed forward. Took so long to get it out of my head that I could not jump, even towards the end I would instinctively attempt to jump up to the ledge above. Once you get used to it however it adds an interesting difficulty aspect which obviously is what makes this game interesting in terms of game mechanics. If you do a google search for this game and the original you will see the original levels side by side. It seems to me that this game stayed pretty freaking true to the original. A top notch remake. I found the game to be very awesome once you accept that yes, you can't jump, deal with it ! Also no you can't duck, deal with it.\nThe level layout as I said based on the original, and it feels it.

This game is really just a nostalgia bomb.  If you never played the original, you may find the grapple-swing platforming mechanics odd and not super fun.\n\nBoss battles seem to be slightly different and there's a hacking mini game at the communication stations that's new, but apart from that it tries to be a faithful reproduction of the original.  Best part?  The remixed music from the old game.  SOLID soundtrack here.  They really did make this an honest redo of the NES version, even modeling the drawings of the characters between missions and in communication sessions after the originals.  They even clip the text the same.\n\nNostalgia is heavy for me here, but without that historical perspective, it's a hard game to recommend.  I'll give two prices on this.  $2 if you never played Bionic Commando and $5 if you did.  It is fun, but it's not going to be the best game you play this year… probably not even this month.\n\nVisuals 6\nGameplay 4\nSlant 3\n\nOverall : 43","February 28, 2014","false","0.6"," 9 of 27 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","9","27","0","0"

The soundtrack is composed (pun intended) of remixes of the original tracks, and they are retro and rad. The gameplay of grappling, swinging, and shooting is intact. There are plenty of secrets, clever boss fights, and hilarious quips from our titular protagonist and his enemies and allies.\nMy gripes are two: one is small and the other is not. First, small gripe, I'm sad to see that there are no steam achievements like there were for the PSN version. Two, big gripe, Bionic Commando: Rearmed for PC is consistently OVERHEATING MY MACHINE, complete with graphical artifacts, system shutdowns, and stern BIOS warnings that the processor is in danger of being damaged.

Back in those NES glory days, we kids never questioned why a bionic commando would be unable to jump or climb over an obstacle. Now, though, it’s stupid and frustrating.\n\nMany positive reviews celebrate this as being a “hard” game, but all of its difficulty stems from the crappy controls. It shouldn’t be rewarded for bad design. I could get over not being able to jump or climb if the grappling mechanics were smooth and responsive, but they aren’t. They’re clunky & counter intuitive. And this in a game full of instant death areas that oh by the way gives you a certain number of lives to get through each level.\n\nI stopped this after about an hour, once I reached a level with a secret area I could not get into after dying & starting all the way over five times. I knew exactly what I had to do and it wasn’t very complicated, but the controls are so unresponsive it became impossibly hard. Then I thought about how, if I did manage to make it into the secret area, I would have to navigate back out the way I came and survive through the rest of the level and the boss fight. If I ran out of lives before that, I’d have to do the entire level all over again. Who thinks that’s fun?\n\nThis game could have been great if they had retooled the grappling system and the level designs. Instead they essentially lifted everything straight from the NES original aside from the graphics. If they weren’t going to update the controls, they should have at least given infinite lives & checkpoints inside levels since the gameplay boils down to tons of trial, error & luck. I bought this during a Steam sale and I regret the purchase. My advice is to get an emulated version of the original NES version. It will give you almost the same experience.","January 22, 2014","false","1.1"," 13 of 36 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","13","36","0","2"

I am clearly in the camp that nostalgia isn't good enough for a game to be fun.\n\nThe gameplay for me is frustrating and awkward. The difference between 'fire the rope and swing', 'fire rope swing and let go', 'fire rope swing, hit wall and bounce a mile into some deadly spikes' is too small.\n\nThe fact that this amazing Commando can only aim horizontaly (at 90 degrees) and can not jump seems perplexing. The story is non existent. The graphics look ok, at best (not that i care too much about graphics when good gameplay is present.)\n\nAll in all, certain games should remain in the past. This is for people looking for a challenge and who are willing to learn a frustrating, antiquated, control system. Almost any new game is better than this. Gave up after 3.4 hours of playing. 3/10\n\nP.S. Doesn't even work out out of the box. Needs the manual searching and installation of old PHYSx drivers to even get into this.

The game is ruined by stupid design choices that inflate difficulty and take away enjoyment. You are playing a platformer that came back out in 2008, and you cant JUMP.....the most common and essential thing. You need to swing to get past a barrel or block. It is supremely stupid and makes dodging shots impossible. The game doesn't tell you but you can use your claws to blow some bullets, that would have been helpful to know. The other big problem is you cant AIM!! What the hell is the games problem. For some reason your guy can only shoot straight forward, and the idea of having his gun point up or down is soo crazy and would make things much easier, but that would just make too much sense. So then there's the arm. For having your game based on this, the swinging and arm mechanics controls are TERRIBLE. You have to press down while falling to shoot sideways. Half the time you will press up and it will shoot sideways. For having to direct it the controls are just super janky. Also, when you fall, for some reason you break the rules of physics and momentum doesn't carry you forward, you drop straight down, unlike any platformer ever. Also the swing mechanics are super terrible, sometimes you just pull up the line, others you swing and let go, and others you hold on. It is unpredictable and not easy to do at all, leading to countless deaths. Most of the time you die you realize its not your fault, its the poor game mechanics or arm controls or stupid restrictions placed on you. Then there are bosses, who they repeat after you beat them.....classic lazy design move. Its tough to figure out the one single way to hurt them, and you dont have the luxury of figuring out because of the other antequated mechanic, of that you get 3 lives and have to start the stage over again. Since you die regularly because you have to use the swinging and grappling mechanic and if you mess up in most parts you instant die, this leads to frustration. The final level was the deal sealer for me. You have to go through tons of rooms and then fight the boss all without losing all your lives or all progress is lost. The only way to get more than like 3-5 is to keep going back to PSA levels and getting single lives, which takes forever. There are also the annoying parts with cars thats slow things down. Sorry but there are some upgrades and secrets and co-op, and a good sense of humor, but those are the only positive features. Avoid this game, it is a disgrace to platformers everywhere. I will now be glad I can jump and aim a gun in games from now on. 4.5/10.","March 23, 2015","false","5.4"," 0 of 10 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","10","0","0"

Issues incude:\n\n1. The controls are trying too hard to emulate the NES original without remedying the issues a modern controller could easily overcome. You can't, for instance, aim in most levels. The right stick isn't used at all. You can fire left and right and that's it. Even in the top down scenes where you CAN aim you shoot in the direction you're walking and so can't stand still and aim.\n\n2. The grapple is essential to gameplay but a pain to use. Like the gun, it can't be aimed and the controls are set up to ensure at some point you'll accidentally fly off a grapple at top speed when you wanted to hang. Add to this insta-death spikes for extra frustration as you kerpow into them and die.\n\n3. Lives. This game has lives. In 2014. To go along with it's insta-death hazards. It is not generous with them.\n\nGenerally, the game confuses "irritate the ♥♥♥♥ out of people" with "challenge" and is far more of a chore than it should be.\n\nIf you're hoping for a fun update to the original NES game, this isn't it.

Your bionic super soldier cant jump! Why the hell cant he jump! Ok ... i have not played this game back then, im not a fan or familiar with the franchise but if they are an bionic army experiment one could assume they have the "POWER" TO JUMP ... yeah its about grapping ... but did their bionic reconfiguration made them disabled to jump.

The gameplay can feel a little stiff, especially since you can't jump in this game (you use your bionic arm as a hook instead) and the last level is particularly punishing (took me 30 minutes just to get to the boss).

But once you get the hang of it you can cruise through older levels like they were nothing (and you should so you can look for hidden powerups). Most levels only take 10-12 minutes to beat.

That would be the grappling hook. Instead of jumping, you would swing from platforms over rows of spikes while shooting at enemies. This game mechanic added a whole new layer of depth to the game, and to be honest, Bionic Commando wouldnt be what it is today if it werent for the grappling hook mechanic.\nSo when the game was getting a remake, everyone got excited. That hype was fullfilled. But let us get into the review.\n\n-WHAT THEY DID RIGHT-\n\n-The graphics are awesome. They have a nice cartoony feel, enemies, players, and backgrounds all look great.\n-The dialogue is so yes. Cutscenes are creative and funny, it really gets you in the mood for the fight.\n-The music is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. Absolutely brilliant remixed Bionic Commando tracks.\n-The bosses are excellent. They really changed up the bosses from the NES version, To be honest, the bosses for Bionic Commando NES play pretty much the same, So in Rearmed they were completely remade, from the area they take place in to the fight itself.\n-Levels are fun and well designed. Nearly every level in Rearmed was a blast to play, from the action, to the puzzle elements involving the grappling hook.\n-RPG Elements work really well. You must beat certain levels in order to get certain items or weapons, which you need to get past the next level. You can also go to peaceful areas in-which you can find more items.\n-Coop and deathmatch. The coop mode is very fun, and deathmatch is AWESOME.\n\n-WHAT THEY DID WRONG-\n\n-While bosses are awesome, They are also hard. Argueably too hard. There is nothing more annoying than dieing to an unexpected attack and then having to restart the whole stage.\n-Some bosses are just rehashs. They have no excuse for this. They remade the bosses, so why not remake the rehashs into their own thing?\n-Levels can be too long. Most notably the Albatross. That stage is the hardest simply because when you die, you have to go through the loooonngg level again.\n-No online multiplayer.\n-When you tab out the game gets jittery until you restart. Why??\n\nDespite those issues, Bionic Commando Rearmed is a masterpiece. The gameplay is fun, The music is awesome, the bosses and unique, And the story is great.\n\nBionic Commando Rearmed gets a 9/10","August 15, 2014","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The boss fights (if you can even call them that) from the old version have been almost totally redone, and are much more satisfying. They are actually unique boss fights, rather than just swarms of enemies coming at you while you try to destroy a reactor.\n\nThe remixed and new music, as well as the sound effects, sound good while keeping a hint of their retro roots. Similar to the music, the levels maintain a nice balance of retro throwbacks and new creations deisgned to really test your ability with the bionic arm. The difficulty of the platforming ramps up nicely, and gets kind of rough at some end parts. There are unlockable challenge rooms as well, that will teach you more advanced mechanics, and improve your skills.\n\nThe weapons from the original have all been reworked and are more varied, with certain weapons performing better against certain foes, or in certain situations.\n\nThe top down levels when you encounter an enemy on the map have been improved as well, but they are so easy and short that they almost feel more like an inconvenience than an addition to the gameplay.\n\nThe "puzzles" you must solve when you hack into enemy communications are also pretty pointless. 95% of the time, there is only one move you can make per turn that won't result in instant failure. This makes them almost solve themselves, and ensures you are not required to actually think for yourself at all.\n\nThat being said, in regards to the communication rooms, you are no longer required to have the correct color radio selected to be able to communicate without just getting static. This is a really nice change.\n\nOverall, it's a very well done remake, that manages to stay true to the original while expanding on the experience. The complaints are minor, and if you enjoyed the original this is kind of a no brainer.","December 10, 2013","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I know that the game industry should be more creative on their own, but this one is really worth it.\n\nTo those less familiar with the original, let me take you on a magical journey - a journey through the world of 2-D platforming. Since before Mario jumped his first goomba, Jumping has been a thing in gaming. Jump up to reach the platforms, jump across gaps. In most games you even get some kind of gimmick, like shooting in Megaman, or your whip in Castlevania. But after some time, jumping and shooting and such was getting very much mainstream. It didn't make a memorable game by itself anymore. So, Capcom, fueled by the successes of Megaman and Street Fighter, made a move that only the geniuses that  they were at the time could have pulled off.\n\nThey removed jumping.\n\nYep. Just took jumping out of a platformer. Just *shoop* Don't need you today jumping. See ya in the next Megaman.\nI can just imagine the reaction in the meetings:\n"Why?! Why by all that is holy would you remove the most basic element of an action-adventure platformer?!"\n\nI'll tell you why. To put in something much better.\nRather that go with the overused jumping mechaincs, they gave you a grapling hook arm, and introduced a swing mechanic. Yes. SWINGING. It may be a little awkward and counterintuitive at first. You may fall into that first pit a dozen times. But keep going, and it suddenly clicks, and you turn into a greenish blur swing through the stages with skill to put Tarzan to shame.\nWere the folks at Capcom insane?    Yes. Were they geniuses?    Also yes.\n\nBut that's not all. Though the story is linear, it gives you an overworld map with a Metriodvania style of exploration. Add to this already unique game one of the best original soundtracks 8-bit games have ever seen, and you got yourself one of the greatest gems the NES has ever offered us.\n\nBut that's the NES game. Here we have the "Rearmed" version. And, long story short, it is incredible.\nTake all of those things that made the original great, and add spectacular 2.5-D graphics, additional mechanics to excite the modern gamer, enhanced soundtrack that still remains true to the original, fun cutscene artwork, a co-op mode, and enough nostalgia tripping to bring a happy tear to the every eye in the collective community of NES gamers, and you get one great game.\n\nNow to be fair, there are a couple of con's here.\nTo maintain the nostalgia factor, they kept the threadbare story from the original, updating it slightly to flow a little more smoothly. So if you're into in-depth storyline games, you're not gonna get much here. It's pretty cut-and-dry. Kill badguys, get cool stuff, kill more badguys, save the day.\n\nAnd, like I mentioned above, the swinging takes some getting used to. You have to be pretty precise at some points, so you'll need some patience to develop the skill. Probably not the best thing for a casual gamer.\n\nBut all in all, this is a wonderful reboot.\nThe great thing is that this 2008 release was obviously meant to build excitement and hype for the 2009 realease of a full 3-D Bionic Commando game. So, we basically got a great game with new life breathed into it for the sake of advertising.","May 30, 2014","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The boss fights (if you can even call them that) from the old version have been almost totally redone, and are much more satisfying. They are actually unique boss fights, rather than just swarms of enemies coming at you while you try to destroy a reactor.\n\nThe remixed and new music, as well as the sound effects, sound good while keeping a hint of their retro roots. Similar to the music, the levels maintain a nice balance of retro throwbacks and new creations deisgned to really test your ability with the bionic arm. The difficulty of the platforming ramps up nicely, and gets kind of rough at some end parts. There are unlockable challenge rooms as well, that will teach you more advanced mechanics, and improve your skills.\n\nThe weapons from the original have all been reworked and are more varied, with certain weapons performing better against certain foes, or in certain situations.\n\nThe top down levels when you encounter an enemy on the map have been improved as well, but they are so easy and short that they almost feel more like an inconvenience than an addition to the gameplay.\n\nThe "puzzles" you must solve when you hack into enemy communications are also pretty pointless. 95% of the time, there is only one move you can make per turn that won't result in instant failure. This makes them almost solve themselves, and ensures you are not required to actually think for yourself at all.\n\nThat being said, in regards to the communication rooms, you are no longer required to have the correct color radio selected to be able to communicate without just getting static. This is a really nice change.\n\nOverall, it's a very well done remake, that manages to stay true to the original while expanding on the experience. The complaints are minor, and if you enjoyed the original this is kind of a no brainer.","December 10, 2013","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I know that CAPCOM has <i>thousands</i> of other games, but after my experience, BCR was probably one of the best to start with. I hate platformers, so when I found out this was a platformer I was a little turned off. However, I had just bought the 2-pack with BCR and the sequel, Bionic Commando, for sale, and I hate jumping into a story without any prior knowledge, so I decided to play through the first one for some background info. After I got used to the controls, I found this game extremely fun. I made it through the first couple of levels pretty quickly, and proceeded to continue with the game. In BCR, there are enemy encounters, and I felt cocky, so I decided to initiate one. That's when I got a big surprise; some parts of the game are played in top-down/isometric shooter mode! Now, most people would just be like,"Oh, well... That's pretty neat!" but I have been on a Diablo-esque hook, meaning I have been hooked on the top-down/isometric playstyle of Diablo and other games, so I was really intrigued by this. Sadly, enemy encounters are very short, but they aren't really a main part of the game, so that's to be expected. All in all, I'm hooked on this old relic of a platformer and can't wait until I play the sequel!","May 15, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's the roots of this massively upgraded version of Bionic Commando. Nintendo... eight bit... and some of the most annoying tunes and sounds of the Nintendo yet. Now upgraded, the tunes are almost the same but now sound so much cooler as they are not tones anymore but actually real music. No longer is this game running on 8 bits anymore but surprisingly on my old dual core laptop with a Nivida graphic card the game ran slow. But Bionic Commando was one of the top games for me at the time. Now with a new twist, this Bionic Commando Rearmed plays almost exactly as the orignal. A difinite plus if you can believe that but now with bosses! This upgraded version painfully tries not to alienate the orignal and does it sucessfully. The new graphics are nice but they can only go so far without breaking out of the 2-D mold of the orignal. This is a real feat as the developers bring a game as dated a Bionic Commando to todays standards without completely remaking it into a entirely new game. I've never seen a retro game redone with this much forethough and careful treading before. This is definitely one of the best remakes of an old classic I've ever seen and recommend this game, even if you have never of Bionic Commando before. The challenge of this game is unique. One of the first and last platformer games that didn't have a jump button but instead had a grapple cable which put a spin on this game that I never saw any other ever copy.","July 19, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I found the controls unbearable. Movement is slow, and actions are clunky. When I learned that this is a side-scroller, and you can't jump... that seemed kind of counter-intuitive to me. Your only method of vertical transportation is a grapple, that is hard to manage and is very limited in precision. Trying to manage all of these quirks was a full-time job, so there was no room left to manage a high difficulty level.\n\n+: From what I see in the community, the original game is beloved, and this remake was met with praise from the fans, leading me to believe there is a high nostalgia factor.

If you never played Bionic Commando on the NES, you don't need to do so to enjoy this game as it is better in pretty much every way possible. There are however plenty of eastereggs and funny references that fans of the original game will appreciate.\n\nThe difficulty level has been stepped up with multiple difficulty settings avalible, and the AI is very impressive for a 2D platformer. All the boss battles have also been completely changed for the better, and if you choose to play in coop their behavior adjust so that team work is required to destroy them. In the original game weapons had very little importance, but this time around every weapon is uniqe and has its own useful applications, which is nice given that the enemy variety has been improved as well. If you were unaware, the gimmick in this game is that you cannot jump and have to rely on using a grapple hook arm to get around. The arm functions pretty much the same way it did in the original game, but with some added features such as the ability to pick up and throw barrels as well as some enemies.\n\nThe ONE issue I have with this game is that if you play on a keyboard you won't be able to control your RC rockets separately from your walking, which makes the final encounter notoriously more difficult.","December 26, 2012","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
