That makes it difficult for me to recommend, because almost every time I try playing one of those old platformers again, I quickly lose interest. It's not that I'm against item collection by default. It's just that the act of collecting items needs to remain fun and varied throughout the game in order for me to enjoy it. In my opinion, very few item collection games successfully accomplish that. They usually become bogged down in tedium and make me feel like I'm just going through the motions.\n\nThe goal of each level is to collect whatever the game tells you to, such as gems, coins, treasure chests, or food. Doing so will unlock an exit portal, which you then have to find and enter before time runs out. Along the way you'll have to dodge enemies and various environmental hazards. The levels are usually open-ended and you can choose which area to clear first. As you finish levels, you can also unlock different characters with special abilites, such as magnetically attracting certain items, or having immunity to certain hazards.\n\nThe main problem I have is that it just feels like a chore to get anything done. Your jump height is low, so there are plenty of spots where you have to jump up multiple platforms stacked on top of each other, which feels awfully monotonous. Your movement speed is slow, so if you have to backtrack through an area you've already cleared, or loop around, it can take a while. Collecting items usually doesn't involve any creativity on your part; mostly you're just jumping from platform to platform a lot. Level mechanics don't evolve that much either, from what I've seen (about half of the game as of this writing). The game adds things like moving platforms and springs, but I never felt like there was enough to make individual levels stand out from each other. Level distinction is something I value very highly in platformers, and I don't see enough here, personally.\n\nAlso, this game can't decide whether it wants to be easy or hard. You can get hit multiple times by enemies before running out of health, and once you do, the game just respawns you somewhere nearby. In addition, you're invincible for a couple of seconds every time you're hit. So, there's little incentive to pay any attention to danger. On the other hand, each level has a fairly strict time limit, and if you run out of time, you have to start over from the beginning. On top of that, both health and time factor into your rating upon finishing a level, and if you get too many low ratings, you won't unlock the next world. What does this game want me to do? If I carefully dodge obstacles, I could run out of time; if I rush through everything, I could get hit plenty of times and get a low health rating. What usually ends up happening, especially in later levels, is that I have to replay stages to get higher ratings. That's a lot of item collecting- much more than I have the patience for.\n\nFinally, I don't like the menu interface. You can't use the mouse. The main menu constantly gets swapped with a high score table even while you're navigating it. There are buttons with pictures instead of text, and it's not obvious what all of them do at first.\n\nIf you loved the original game this one is based on, or if you're more fond of item collection games than I am, you might enjoy this. For everyone else, I can't recommend it.","April 26, 2014","false","3.2"," 135 of 182 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","135","182","0","5"

No witty wordplay or abstract analogy to somehow tie back in with the game I'm discussing, no recount of the developers history, and no commentary on how it fits in with the evolution of video games as a medium. That's because Canyon Capers allows absolutely no creative thought to entire or leave your head while you slog your way through it's glaring mediocrity, as silent pleas for it to end fill every crevice of your mind.\n\nThat likely sounds a little harsh, but Canyon Capers really doesn't give you much to work with in attempts to find fun in its hollow core. It's a floaty platformer collectathon, which unsuccessfully attempts to instill variety by swapping out the object you're hunting as you spin jump your way through nondescript, annoying designed levels as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized Cabbage Patch Kid. Controlling it is a chore, and levels are designed in such a way as to require you to go through long periods of backtracking with every minor mistake you make. It's monotonous, tedious, and so painfully amateur in every single aspect of its design that it would almost look out of place at a 24 hour game jam.\n\nI could likely go into greater detail on each and every aspect of one of Canyon Capers laundry list of flaws, but the thought of spending more time writing about it is almost as unappealing as playing it again, so I'm going to cut my short and assume I've spewed enough vitriol to get my point across. I couldn't recommend spending your time with this game if it was free in a browser, and I really can't see anyone coming away satisfied having actually paid money for it.","September 26, 2014","false","2.3"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","27","29","0","0"

But even still it's hard to believe that this game made it past 'Greenlight'.  It's practically a poor man's flash game platformer, similar to the really bad titles you would see on the Xbox Live Indie Marketplace (not saying all of them are bad, but a fair chunk of them are).\n\nFirst off, the graphics look cheap, and I mean REALLY cheap.  I'm just not a fan of the overly pixelated style graphics in general, but this makes that style look like a masterpiece in comparison. The backgrounds also have barely any life to them, with maybe one or two blinking eyes in a dark area or what-not and that's about it (At least that's how far I made it into the game, but I'll get to that part soon).\n\nThe sound effects are inappropriately used, whenever you jump on an enemy, a 'farting' noise is made. This sound is used over and over again and you'll soon be wanting to get through the game without going anywhere near the enemies at all. And that's another thing, getting actually 'hit' by the enemies does take your life away, but even when you die it doesn't matter. You just respawn in EXACTLY the same place you were before. So the illusion of 'game over' is completely gone.\n\nThere's also a time limit in each level, so you have to get the set amount of items and get to the exit portal before it runs out. Nuff' said.\n\nOverall, this game is a heck of a chore to get through, and if you must try it out, go to Indiegala and get it for free. Even paying for this game at a 75% discount is not worth it.\n\n-GabrielKnightStorm","September 4, 2014","false","1.8"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/275490/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nCayon Cappers is a 2D plat former that usually handles pretty well, you unlock other characters as you get higher scores on levels (by unlocking stars). The whole concept of this platformer is to "collect all the things", after you collect the required items a portal opens and you finish the level.\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  I'm under the impression that you're an explorer, inside a canyon, capping gems, coins, fruit, and treasure boxes. There are 10 levels in each world, and 5 worlds to play through, each with their own "theme". Don't get too excited though, I saw little to no change in environment, only scaling difficulty at a dramatic rate, and different music.\nMost platformers don't have much of a story, you're supposed to like them because of their gameplay. Sorry, your princess is in another castle. There really isn't much else to say about the story, it's uninteresting, if barely existing at all.\n\nGame Play: I heard a great man once said, "There's a difference between difficulty, and a broken game." (I think it was either JohnTron, or ExtraCredits) As much as I wanted to hate Cayon Cappers for being a hard game, I didn't hate it until I ran into glitches.\nI would say 90% of the game is glitch free, but I ran into glitches that would respawn me in a kill zone, (aka: I would spawn and then insta-die. Good stuff) this type of failiure is one of the most frustrating that any gamer would need to endure. One particular spot on the LAST LEVEL of the LAST WORLD, I was killed and ran out of time while a bomb ticked to my immanent failure, because I kept respawning under a swinging axe blade of death.  ...After something like that you can only quit the game before you go Super Saiyan from Rage.\n\nAchievements: The first few achievements are freebie's, you literally get one for just playing called "the easiest achievement you will get". The toughest achievements are the "complete 100%" type. So if you're aiming for achievements this is doable, but only if you're good at platformers. I would originally say "this is an easy 100% for achievements", but I have reversed my opinion since world 4. I now lack 3 stars on one level: the last one. I have gotten 9000 points and still haven't gotten 3 stars. (finished it about 3 times)\n\nPrice:  I got this game for free, so I can't complain too much here, but the price for Canyon Cappers $6.99, which is a pretty high price, but if you know you love playing all playformers, you can probably make it worth it. But it would be best to get the game on sale.\n\nConclusion: I initially thought "yes! a playformer I can beat", but since the last two worlds were so brutal, my disposition has soured for this game. Additionally this game just make me feel bad for being bad, because the characters have huge smiles on their faces, and each jump is a flip.\nTo recap, the story was  nonexistent. the gameplay was painful. Achievements were pretty doable (and at times the only motivation for me). The price was reasonable. This game will appeal to people who love platformers and can over look a "childish" graphic style.","January 17, 2015","false","16.5"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

Dino Jnr. in Canyon Capers was one of those forgotten games, personally I never played it despite being a fan of the genre and as such when I heard that some of the original developers had regrouped and made a spiritual successor in the form of Canyon Capers I was intrigued at this previously unknown entry in a genre I cared about so dearly.\n\nWhen you boot it up Canyon Capers doesn’t put its best foot forward to say the least. The menus are to put it lightly, completely terrible. They look like they were designed for a touch screen, yet this is a PC exclusive indie game. The whole thing consists of large generic buttons that as you gaze in awe of their poor design for a brief second are quickly replaced by a high score table that requires a button press to escape. It’s a minor annoyance but first impressions mean a lot. After getting past this initial hurdle however I was pleasantly surprised by what I found.\n\nCanyon Capers is intentionally ugly, at least I assume that’s what the developers were going for. Most of the environment art reminds me of the ugliness of Amiga games back in the day, while the playable characters look a little out of place and of poorer quality. The level environments have a good amount of charm to them, there’s some nicely designed tile art and tells for secret passages and such which in general looks rather nice in a charming, kinda ugly, way.\n\nI went back to see how the old DOS/Amiga game looked and it was pretty impressive how well the developers have captured the look of it. Everything about the art seems slightly dated but it’s all harking back to the original game, which is something I respect in a lot of ways, even if I find parts of it displeasing to look at. Hearing the game is equally old-school and intentionally dated. The music is fine but not memorable but the sound effects very quickly go from charming to irritating after you’ve heard the springy “Boing” when you jump for the hundredth time.\n\nThankfully, however, the core gameplay of Canyon Capers is pretty good. It’s aiming more obscurely than most entering itself into a sub-genre of platformers which focused around collecting objects to escape levels. A genre which relied on challenge in the shape of well placed enemies and level design and one which fell out of fashion quite a long time ago. The core mechanics are simple, you move and you jump. Jumping on enemies temporarily kills them and you want to jump and collect items to get out of the level. Each level has some kind of challenge, usually this consists of things like “Collect all of x coloured gem” or “Collect all the coins in a time limit” it’s simple and other games have fallen trying to use this kind of structure before but rarely do they have good controls to back them up which thankfully this game does.\n\nThe level design is actually pretty great and each level feels unique and rarely unfair, the platforming itself is responsive and fun and overall the gameplay is pretty much spot on. There are unfortunately a few levels that let the design down with springs that lead onto platforms filled with insta-kill enemies, a common one. The variation in levels is mostly “collect this instead of that” but leaderboards and scores for each level go far to encourage replayability. As does the good number of unlockable characters. There are multiple environments but they all feel pretty samey and the whole thing can all get a little boring pretty quickly.\n\nCanyon Capers is a simple, cheap and fun platformer that will definitely not be for everyone. Its’ dated art style definitely put even me off quite a bit and its mechanics are solid and well designed but perhaps a bit too simple and locked into the history of its name. That said, underneath its unimpressive exterior is a decent platformer that offers up a reasonably meaty experience and no doubt a nostalgia trip for players who grew up on DOS and Amiga games.","March 19","true","9.5"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

In most of the level’s game modes you have to open this vortex by doing one of three different quests:\n-	Gather all items of one kind (there’s gems, coins, treasures and food)\n-	defuse all bombs in the correct order (within an extra-timelimit for each bomb)\n-	pick up EVERY item to please the gods and collect their favor.\nIn the fourth and final game mode, the vortex is already opened and you just have to reach it, while collecting as many items as possible.\nWhile doing so, you have to deal with a strict timelimit, traps and monsters (which you can usually kill by jumping onto their head) and a leveldesign of increasing difficulty.\n\nThat’s basically what you do for 50 levels, and after a short while it gets really repetetive. The different game modes really don’t change much, especially if you want to reach a 3-star-rating for each level. In this case you’d have to collect every item anyways, so it doesn’t really matter, which game mode the level has.\n\nAdditionally there are situations where you simply die because of weird design-choices, for example when you respawn in the path of a trap, which hits you just as you respawn. Fortunately, you’re usually able to escape after one or two deaths, but there are situations which just don’t feel ‘fair’ to the player.\n\nTechnically the game has a lot of flaws aswell. The graphics are okay at best, the music is terrible (and after 14 hours of gameplay I’ve failed to find a way to lower the volume, there's just a mute-button) and the localisation is just awful. Apparently they used google-translator for almost every language, which makes anything besides english un-readable.\n\nDespite that, the game is not terrible. It’s just not good either. It’s definitely doable to finish the game in maybe 6 hours, with all achievements it might take 12. The question is: Do you really want to invest that much time (and 6$) in a subpar game, when there are so many better games to play.\n\nOn a scale from 1-10 I’d maybe give it a 3.","January 2, 2015","false","19.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/macktacular/recommended/275490/","macktacular","Charlie Foxtrot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/macktacular/","185 products in account","Short review: Don't buy this game, even on sale. This game is bad. I got the thing for free, no idea how, and will be deleting it off of my pc because I would rather have the empy hard drive space than own this game.\n\nControls: I don't know what people consider to be accurate terms for describing controls. Tight? Loose? Responsive? Floaty? The only way I can think to describe this game is "slippery". Your character controls like... other characters might in an ice level of a traditional platformer. Playing through eight levels of this game, I never got a handle on how the character actually controlled. When I jumped a gap I hoped they'd land where I wanted them to go, but could never feel certain. Vertical jumps were hit and miss; I'd make ones I didn't think I could, and miss ones I thought should have been easy.\n\nBut what about the character's attacks or special abilities? I can't comment on that because I have no idea if there even are any.\n\nUser Interface: It is at an absolute bare minimum. This game looks like it was made for a smartphone, with five massive buttons on the splash screen, all of which are just symbols. Want to know what the controls are, or change them? Too bad, no button for that. At least, not one that's readily apparent. Games don't have to have prompts to tell you how to do every little action all the time, but at the very least you should be able to look up your control scheme.\n\nThe hud is fairly bad. Your health-meter is a giant heart on the top-right corner of your screen. I have no idea how many hits I can take before I die, because it just gets smaller. You'll never be looking at it anyway, as it's pretty much opposite of the level time which is just a counting-down progress bar at the bottom of the screen. So yeah, everything is just vague.\n\nArt style: General: Many of the elements of the UI and such look like they were made in Flash. Now Flash can be a great and amazing program; when I say "made in Flash" I mean "made in Flash and put on Newgrounds in 2002". Much of the art uses things like oval tools and such in it's construction, such as the cow-head logo. You know, like you'd use to make art in MS Paint? It looks lazy and amateurish.\n\nArt style: Character: Character looks like they took a larger image and resized it at an unequal aspect ratio. No one wants to play as an ugly character unless you're playing a next-gen first/third person shooter ooh-rah.\n\nArt style: Enemies: Some of the enemies look alright, but many of them are things like little green mice and other cute things. They look like they should be rescued by you, not that they'll harm you. Hit boxes are fairly hit or miss as well.\n\nArt style: Level / items: You know, this is where the game is best... or least-worst. A lot of the art elements for the level design actually look pretty great. But there's a mixture of styles. You have these great shaded in-depth elements like rock pillars and platforms, or treasure chests, then off-set by cartooney coins or very flat-looking mine carts. It looks like several different people worked on different art elements and they just combined them together, rather than working together with one specific art style. It took me about four levels to realize that the pillars of flame shooting from the ground wouldn't hurt you but were actually just torches to light your way.\n\nLevel design: It's just platforming, nothing too amazing, right? Well there are parts where the game screws this up too. Some areas are only accessable by one route. That's fine for extra stuff, but when you have to transverse 2/3rds of the level to reach an area, then fall due to the poor controls, and have to start over again... in a game that's focused on timed treasure collection, that's fairly inexcusable.\n\nStory: As far as I know, there isn't one. But games don't always need a story if they're fun. But since this game isn't fun the lack of story harms it more.\n\nPlaystyle: There is no consequence for dying. There isn't a lives counter and your health meter is totally ambigious. So you could die a few times in a level and not even really realize it. When you do die, you often respawn in odd locations; there are no obvious check-points.\n\nWhen you are hit by an enemy you have invincibility frames, that's pretty great right? Except that you can't hit enemies during those frames either. So you may get hit by an enemy and then try to jump on another enemy, only pass through that enemy and "rematerialize" inside of them, which makes you take another hit. And sometimes you just go invisible, which isn't great in a game where you can't control your character very well when you CAN see them.\n\nOh and remember those minecarts I mentioned earlier? In other games you'd jump in one and it would "catch" you, like a bucket. Not in this game. You can slide or walk out the side of them. That's just poor programming.\n\nFinal verdict: There are elements here that could make for a good game, if more time had been applied, more experience been used... I really don't know. I can't tell if this was made by amateurs who gave it their all, or by a company that just slapped something together to try and make some quick cash. That's the boggling thing about a game like this; you don't know if it's failures should be depressing or infuriating.","January 8, 2015","false","2.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Failed that section of platforming? Well you have to do it over again because there's whatever collectable you need up there. Oh, you did one moderately annoying section first? Well the exit's at the end of it, so you have to do it again. All within a time limit. And there's a horribly annoying beeping noise when your time is running low that lasts way too long, so have fun with that too.\n\nIt's not that I don't like games with timers, it just doesn't seem to work with the game design. If the game were a left-to-right get-to-the-end sort of thing then yeah it would make sense. But this is a get-all-the-things platformer where you can choose the order in which you get said thing, so basically if you go the wrong way first, you have to start over.\n\nThe music is unremarkable. The level design looks like it could be interesting, but the timer makes it so I can't really appreciate it.\n\nI get that it's going for a retro style, I think maybe Canyon Capers is leaning a little too heavily on that. Other games have taken the retro aesthetic and retro gameplay, but combine those with modern gameplay advances to make actual, enjoyable games.\n\nThere was a time when this sort of game probably would have been enjoyable, but that time has passed and I think we are much better for it.","January 1, 2015","false","1.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Turns out it is quite good fun and I ended up playing it a chunk myself.\nIt works well with the keyboard or a 360 controller and is responsive and accurate with either. It plays nice and smooth too.\nThe graphics have a retro style/feel but without resorting to the usual blocky style many retro style games have.\nFinally the difficulty curve seems pretty much just right. Quite simple to learn but getting more difficult as the levels progress giving you that 'just one more go' appeal.  End of level score is based on how much you collected and you are also awarded stars - so theres a replay factor there too in returning to collect any missing stars.\nThe sound is the only real area thats a letdown. The music isnt especially bad and fits in well but starts to get quite repetitive and there seems to be very little in the way of different sound effects.\nOverall I can highly recommend Canyon Capers, its not going to be the next COD or GTA - but in terms of value and fun its great !\n","June 24, 2014","true","0.7"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","0"

As with the original I got this one here for free in a give-away, and under this circumstances I found it quite enjoyable.\n\nIt's a really classic Jump'n'Run that depends on collecting all the items on the level in a given time and then reaching the exit that is hidden somewhere in the level. This game looks, sounds and plays like an Amiga game from the late 80's / early 90's.\n\nAs said before I like it, but it has numerous let-downs that will push many customers away from it:\n\n1. The translation to other languages than English is really bad. You won't understand what the game is telling you unless you switch it to english language in the main menu.\n\n2. The screenshots here on the shop page definitley are "lifted up" by using some simple filters. The game itself has a very blocky look and feel to it with the exception of a few single objects in the game. That again leads me to the point that this game was planned for release on another platform years ago (looks really like Amiga to me) before releasing it on Steam nowadays and adding the last few bits without changing the rest.\n\n3. The game slows down noticeable when there is too much on the screen at the same time. It keeps fluidly playable while doing so but the slowdown is there.\n\n4. The Leveldesign and the overall playability and layout of the game is totally early 90's style. And by that I don't necessarily mean the good style ... (What - on the other hand - isn't necessarily bad if you like games designed that way ... ;)\n\nConclusion:\n\nChances are high, that if you liked playing your Amiga back in the days you may like this game for bringing back memories. If you're more used to modern titles you probably won't like this game. I personally am having my fun with it but as I said I got it for free.\n\nOne thing that can be hold positive is that the developers seem to update the game frequently, so maybe some (if not all) of the flaws mentioned above will be worked on, if not removed completely.\n\nFor myself I can recommend this game, and I'm very happy I got it. You may enjoy it too as long as you want a true retro experience.  I think it's a little overpriced though. So buy it on a discount for e.g. 1,99 € to 4,99 € and the DLC for 0,49 € to 0,99 €.

Canyon Capers is by no means an unfinished title, but the polish was done wrong. Through the first 6 levels I had 6 different objectives and between levels even items seemed inconsistent. It was as if one group member liked coins from Mario, one enjoyed gems from bejeweled and the third was a lover of Spelunky chests and enemies. Meanwhile, the overachieving fourth member was busy incorporating all 3 rather than bringing focus to the game.\nThe game is pretty, the controls are passable, but the sounds are obnoxious and the entire title feels very disjointed and incohesive.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/275490/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Okay, look. If you want to make a game that's just about collecting things, that's fine. There are games with simpler premises than that. But if you're not going to go deep on gameplay, you need to go hard on the polish and the feel. A coin collecting game in this day and age needs to be the most incredible, mind-blowing coin collector in the world to make it worth your time. Guess what Canyon Capers isn't.\n\nYou play Dino, a dopey little fellow with an Alfalfa part and the loudest shoes imaginable, as he traverses simple levels in search of gems, coins, chests, food, or all four. The first thing you will surely notice is how impossibly ugly this game is. I can't even try to be nice about it, because every level is a trainwreck of sprites and colors. For some reason nothing is rendered at the same resolution, so you might have a photo-realistic tiki mask sitting atop a 16-bit bit of grass. Not even Dino and the hapless creatures you goomba-stomp (with a farting noise, no less) match. The colors are also rich and garish, clashing against each other and making it impossible to know what is foreground, background, passable, and solid.\n\nEven if the game weren't hideous, there'd be little to nothing to keep you playing. Every level is just about collecting things. Sometimes it's one kind of treasure, sometimes it's all four, sometimes it's ticking time bombs, and sometimes it's all optional on the way to the exit. Without exception, you will always be collecting something before reaching the exit. There are no powerups to hasten your lazy stride or let you jump higher than your normal, awkward somersault. Stomping enemies doesn't even gain you anything besides points, because they respawn seconds later.\n\nI had a hard time writing this review because there was so much to hate about Canyon Capers. Taking damage makes you invincible for a few seconds but also makes you pass through enemies, so you have to stay well away until it wears off. Dying just respawns you nearby, and can absolutely spawn you inside a monster to get hit. Slow enemies are often set in caves where the ceilings are too low to jump them. Levels are laid out with ideal paths that make backtracking to collect missed items extremely time-consuming.\n\nThere are additional characters to unlock with different passive abilities, but they're specific to one kind of treasure and you don't know what kind you're collecting until you start the level. It's such a simple thing, but emblematic of Canyon Capers' shortcomings. The game feels like someone's first experiment with GameMaker, slipshod designs and artless aesthetics and all. I don't have the words for how far you should stay away from this game, but know that it is very, very far.","February 7","false","1.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Bad graphics, bad platforming, zero depth, and a lack of any real originality makes me honestly wonder how the heck this even made it onto steam.  The only honest-to-God reason for playing this I can imagine is solely the card-drop factor.\nAlso, this is the first game I've ever played where invincibility frames actually work to the detriment of the player.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/qualitygrapes/recommended/275490/","qualitygrapes","Sunrise","http://steamcommunity.com/id/qualitygrapes/","561 products in account","Playing Canyon Capers is like playing Super Mario because of the theme, music ( pretty much ), and the gameplay. What I liked about the game is that it's fun and exciting as you unlock more characters and levels. The levels on World 1 is pretty easy but it gets harder and harder as you unlock more levels which would be quite frustrating to finish with a 3 stars (high score). I liked the characters too, without those characters it won't be fun because it gets boring afterwards.\n\nThe annoying part is that when you get on to level 5 or something which has the lava thing. When you get hit by the furball and fall in the lava, you'll respawn to the top lava area and unluckily, you will get hit again lool.\n\nSo if you're looking for a game which is good for an hour to play, better try this out. 6/10","December 13, 2014","true","3.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I had absolutely no clue what it was about, or anything like that, but I played it, because, hey. I was given it, and it has cards.\n\nThe premise of this game is some form of really poorly made platformer. The art isn't bad, but the actual physics, and animation is where the game falters, as well as the controls.\n\nThe jumping feels sluggish, and bland, and the animations just don't look good. This game tries to be Super Mario without the huge jumps, or the powerups, and it fails badly at it.\n\nThe menus are borderline horrific, as I spent a while just bashing buttons trying to find out how to actually start this horrific venture into the world of poorly made indie platformers, and the controls also took me a while to figure out, because apparently, WASD isn't cool anymore, and, to my knowledge, we can't even change the controls.\n\nIn short, this game is horrible, gives me headaches, and you're better off just playing Super Mario, or something more well made that doesn't crash every five seconds, and leave the process running. But what am I complaining. I get cards.\n\n10/10.","July 25, 2014","true","4.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

There are no canyons to be found, there are no capers to be found, and there is no fun to be found no matter how long and hard you search. This would have been better off had the name been used for a porno and the game not even made. Or at least been named "Pure Garbage".\nWithout doubting myself for even a hundredth of a second I can say this game has the worst, most generic music in the history of video games. It sounds like what the soundtrack for farming simulator would be if it had one (it might I have no idea). The sound is also beyond horrible, possibly the worst sound effects ever for a game. When you get hit it sounds like a guy opening his mouth and shaking his head going "rba-rba-rba" and when you jump on an enemy it makes a fart sound effect. The game is highly generic. The graphics are a poorly failed attempt at being retro. The art direction is as standard as it gets: snakes, frogs, rats, gems, green backgrounds, fire pits, dirty diapers, all animated the equivalent of paper cutouts. Through the twenty minutes I was playing, I was constantly taking damage through a combination of the controls being slippery and poor hit detection on the hit boxes around enemies, combined with the fact that I just did not care even the slightest bit if I was being hit or not because I knew right away that after my short while in the game it was going to be uninstalled and forgotten forever.\n\nI think this seriously might just be a parody game and not supposed to be played as a real game. Even if that is true, it is still a poor, unfunny attempt at mocking video games.\n\nThis was free and I still feel like I overpayed.\n1/10","October 12, 2014","false","0.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Whole gameplay is based on collecting gems, coins and treasure chests and avoiding monsters. It could be fun but it isn't. Too simple, too repetitive and just borring. Artwork, level design and animations are worse than in most 1990's platformers, and simply ugly. Sound effects are just iritating. Most free flash platformers online for example on Kongregate are made better. Do not waste your money on this crap. I've got this game from  free bundle but it's not worth playing even for free. If you seek for a good platformer avoid this thing at all cost. Believe me even game made in 1993: Magic Boy was more fun to play than this.","September 11, 2014","false","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game ruins platforming. You are on a specific time each level, and you must collect part/everthing in the level. All the levels look the same, and the items you collect don't actually do anything. If you get touched you go flying backward, which is always such a stupid inclusion in platformers. The guy jumps terribly and awkwardly. It sucks having every level ruined because you missed 1 tiny item, or how you didn't plan your route perfectly, meaning its trial and error. Another problem is every level is linear, meaning if you want to get to the upper right and you're in the lower right, you have to get to the middle, then go right, then left, then right, and youll be there, because thats the single way to go there, which leads to backtracking. I jsut sick of retrying levels because this isn't a real platformer with progressing levels, objectives, or story. Just collect-a-thon where you need to "collect all gems in 45 seconds or restart level until you can".

I read the reviews and I expected a bomb of a game, simple shovelware. But I was surprised. Very surprised.\n\nAmiga 2600\nThe game plays and feels like an old Amiga game. In the looks department, eh, Amiga has come a long way since then but Amiga owners are a very small crowd now and the golden era for Amiga has long since passed. Although still, their is something about that more innocent era of video games, similar to games done in the style of an NES, like Megaman 9 & 10 where it just takes you right back to your childhood where you would look past the bad and just buckle down to enjoy that weekend rented game.\n\nTimes have changed though, Amiga is virtually dead, gamers no longer 'rent' games and expectations are very high.\nIf you are not the kind of person who cares for a retro throwback then you will not care for this game too much at all. As far as platform games go, it isn't bad but it isn't good either. Think of early Castlevania's, BEFORE symphony of the night, clustered with unfair deaths and it will give you a good sense of what you are getting into.\n\nWhat a canyon load of caper!\nInfact as it turns out, the game does indeed have it roots in an Amiga game, of the name "Huckleberry Hound in Hollywood Capers". Amusingly enough the Amiga game was met with mixed to bad reviews which just goes to show that a good game, is forever good and a bad game is forever bad! I hated that game as a child, it was so...Bad! You wasted my weekends Kevin Blake (Lead Programmer), I will find you and I will dump a log on your face and I'm not talking about the wood kind!\n\nAre you for real?!\nDid you know?\nCanyon Capers is a reskin of Huckleberry Hound in Hollywood Capers?\n\nDid you also know?\nHuckleberry Hound in Hollywood Capers was a reskin of Dino Jnr. in Canyon Capers?!\n\nDammit Kevin, I haven't seen stuff pulled like this since the 'Ninjabread Man' = 'Anubus II' = '‎Myth Makers: Trixie in Toyland', Fiasco!\n\nIf you are an Amiga fan, then this game will take you right back to that era in no short order, which is why I recommended it. It is a faithful recreation of the amiga experience.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","September 19, 2014","true","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Call it lazy, call is uninspired, but a lot of people grew up on games like this one, and sometimes it's just nice to play something that doesn't have you wanting to tear your hair out every ten minutes. Does that mean this game is great? No. But it's really not that bad.\n\nAs casual as games come, 'Canyon Capers' is a simple 2D side-scrolling item collecting game, and not a tough as nails super precise platformer. Which I'm sure some people thought that it might be before purchasing it, or deciding to get it in a bundle. Sure it doesn't have the best sound effects, or music, or level design, or art style, or anything really. But you know what? I've played a ton of games that were much worse than this one, and at least 'Canyon Capers' does what it sets out to do; give players the ability to collect coins, fruits, and gems!\n\nSure, this game is extremely basic, as is the level design and overall challenge, but that's kind of what these games are all about. So if you're in the mood to just relax and waste a few minutes, then this game can be an enjoyable experience. Oh yeah, and I'm pretty sure that this game is for children, ya know, kids. But I suppose all of you people who gave this game a negative review hate on 'Reader Rabbit' too, or maybe you thought the movie 'Muppets in Space' was too "juvenile"; well to hell with all of you I say! Now everyone, into the canyon!","February 27, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

In fact if you want to obtain the same experience as playing this game for 0.7 hours just hit yourself in the skull and crotch at the same time for that amount of time and you'll be close.\n\n- Terrible Graphics (not retro just terrible)\n- Terrible Controls\n- Later levels have objectives that are near impossible (not completely, but close enough to make you say "♥♥♥♥ this game")\n- Music is like nails on a chalkboard\n- The "auto-jump if the button is being held" is counter to every single platformer on the market where holding the button makes you jump higher. This means when you hold the button expecting to jump higher you instead instantly jump once you land causing you usually to kill yourself.\n- There is no "jump higher" and there are ledges that are like a millimeter too high and force you to retrace the entire level to hopefully make a jump ... if you don't be prepared to travel the whole level again.\n- All those annoyances are thrown into a game where each level has a very short time limit. So you feel rushed and frustrated from the second you begin playing.\n\nJust avoid this game like the plague ... if you have the chance to get it for free, treat it like you would "Free Herpes."","November 9, 2014","false","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The levels have no depth to them, just a bunch of annoying platforming (I love platforming games, but the way this game plays makes it hard to even do that).\n\nThe animation is terrible.

This game sucks so bad I want to find a way to remove it from my steam list. They should be paying me for the time I spent in this game. In fact if you want to obtain the same experience as playing this game for 0.7 hours just hit yourself in the skull and crotch at the same time for that amount of time and you'll be close.\n\n- Terrible Graphics (not retro just terrible)\n- Terrible Controls\n- Later levels have objectives that are near impossible (not completely, but close enough to make you say "♥♥♥♥ this game")\n- Music is like nails on a chalkboard\n- The "auto-jump if the button is being held" is counter to every single platformer on the market where holding the button makes you jump higher. This means when you hold the button expecting to jump higher you instead instantly jump once you land causing you usually to kill yourself.\n- There is no "jump higher" and there are ledges that are like a millimeter too high and force you to retrace the entire level to hopefully make a jump ... if you don't be prepared to travel the whole level again.\n- All those annoyances are thrown into a game where each level has a very short time limit. So you feel rushed and frustrated from the second you begin playing.\n\nJust avoid this game like the plague ... if you have the chance to get it for free, treat it like you would "Free Herpes."","November 9, 2014","false","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game feels like a mobile port. There are really annoying, unskippable animations. The game feels very unresponsive in the menus. The style isn't consistent at all.\n\nBut worst of all, it's just plain not fun. It feels like a chore.\n\nI do like the little lens flare effect the gems give off and the flip-jump thing.

Very grainy, similar colors bleed together.\n\n*Hitbox detection on enemies seems to be off- or maybe it's just another quirk of the terrible tumbling short jump, and you not managing to get the height or angle the game would require to register  proper hit.\n\n*While early stages have you nearly immortal and thus the control frustrations are managable, looking at the screenshots with the handling in mind, I can only imagine later stages to be infuriatingly stressing.\n\n*Don't expect even a basic tutorial- not even to tell you what basic movement keys are.\n\n\n||Bonus: Pros according to the more helpful other reviews||\n*Unlockable Characters\n*Unlockable Abilities\n*Plays better with a controller\n*Doesn't actually slowly descend your soul into a realm of eternal torment (Unconfirmed)\n\nHop around a stage, collect poorly hidden secrets and a slew of gems and coins, try desperately to clumsily circle around platforms or get the right angle to actually land on an enemy's head..\n\nIf it wasn't so painful to play, it'd honestly just be boring with its blandness.\n\nI just can't recommend this game at all.\n\n1/5","December 4, 2015","false","4.9"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

The game haves ok controls, tiring music since there is like only 1 track, okay-ish art (except for the stock pictures) horrible translations and even bad grammar on its own language, and bad level design, and this last one is the one that strikes the hardest, because this is the sole reason I dont reccoment it, it gets frustatingly hard vary fast. I actually was having fun for the first few levels but then there where this tricky jumps and overall bad design on the levels that threw me off at around level 6 I think.\n\nI don´t mean the game is terrible, there was definetly some effort put into it, its just something I wouldnt go out recommending to my friends or people who haves little kids, because there are definetly better games out there even for the young ones (which my guest is where the target audience).","September 4, 2014","false","2.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cetais/recommended/275490/","cetais","Cetais","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cetais/","772 products in account","This game is frustrating. Not in a good way though.\nEvery levels feels like the same, Sound effects feels out of place, the different characters doesn't do much except change the aesthetic, and the whole game reeks of really bad level design. The only difference between so many levels are, one you collect coins, one you collect gems, and one you collect treasures. Some level have a combination of them, but seriously -- what's the point of making some different things to collect if they're pretty much the same? It doesn't add variety, it makes the game feel even more bad and amateur-ish.\n\nIn one level, which was one of the first in the second world (Level 11, then) one freaking flying ennemy kept hitting me every single time I was going to do a jump to reach the final treasure; only to be hit by the flying ennemy WHO ALSO CHARGES AT YOU, Result, I miss my jump, I have to go ALL THE WAY FROM THE BEGINNING, only to miss the jump again.\nThere were like 3 seconds left after I finally finished the level, and I got 3 stars. I could have finished it with a minute left, but I still had an high score for the level!?\n\nI really feel like nobody test those levels, they are really boring, frustrating jumps, bad item placement, oddly-placed ennemies. Seriously, some ennemies are on some unreachable place of the level, which makes you think you can go there at first, but then you realize they were too lazy to put something to make you understand that you can't go there.\n\nThere's those bombs levels, they are really bland and boring. They don't even look like bombs, and most of the time you miss your jump, the bomb supposedly explodes, and you go back to the level select screen. Once you get rid of one, you need to search the whole level for the next one, since there's a particular order. most of the time, the next bomb is the one WHO IS RIGHT NEXT TO THE OTHER; it feels like they wanted to put more "bombs" than the level could, so they set up some bombs right next to the other. It feels like some really lazy level design.\n\nThere's those freaking tunnels in this game, where sometimes ennemies go throught, and if you don't want to get hurt, you need to wait since there's no way to not get it by an ennemy in one of them. Ugh.\n\nOne of the thing I hate the most in this game, it's those big boulder who kill you one hit. IN those levels with boulders, they spawn randomly, and it's really hard to not get hit. It frustrates me way too much.\n\nThe whole life counter looks good, but I'm unable to know if I can or can't get hit again. It's one big heart who minimize every time I get it, except it doesn't seems to be smaller at first.\n\nIf it's supposed to be a "retro platformer", why can you get hit something like 10 times before dying and respawning somewhere defined in the game?\n\ndon't get me "jumped" about those jumps in this game. They are horrible.\n\nTL;DR, stay away from this game. Don't even buy it, it doesn't even worth it. I got it free, and I feel stolen when I think about this game.","September 4, 2014","false","7.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

More importantly, why are you potato?\n\nCanyon Capers is your classic platformer, except you're allowed to get hit more than once and (from what I've seen so far) allowed to die infinite times, which defeats the purpose of all the extra hearts that you can find lying around the stages.\n\nDying is not the kicker though. Your real enemy is the clock.\nIf time runs out before you can gather all the items, you'll have to start over collecting everything for that stage, which can range from "Oh, that's not so bad" to "FML".\n\nOne of my personal least favorite platformers to date is a game called 8BitBoy.\nSo when I saw this game, I said to myself "Huh...will this game make me appreciate 8BitBoy...!?"\n\nI went into playing Canyon Capers expecting to be monstrously more disastrous than the other indie platformer I've mentioned, and honestly...it wasn't as bad as I expected, but it's still pretty terrible.\n\nI expected this game to one shot you and make you start over from the very beginning, but this game is actually kind enough to start you back up from where you last stood a few seconds ago, which is something I really appreciate over 8BitBoy's death mechanics.\n\nHowever, two of the biggest turn offs in this game are the designs for this game and the SFX.\nDesigns amazingly look worse when in motion versus looking at them through screenshots, and the SFX is something to be undesired.\n\nWhen you jump on snakes, they make fart noises.\nI don't know why that's even a thing.\n\nIt was amusing for the first snake or two, but then I got incredibly annoyed by the noise immediately.\nAnd then there's the BLBLBLBLBL SFX when you get hit. Just as annoying as the fart noises, and it comes more frequently as you progress.\n\nIn the end, I came here expecting to be disappointed, and the results did not disappoint.\n\nSo yeah. Unless you're just here for the steam cards, stay away from this game.\nAnd if you were planning to buy this, definitely stay away from this game, and save that money to buy something more worthy.\n\nYou want a retro platformer with challenges that badly?\nLook up "You have to win the game."\n\nThat game is free on steam, and is by far one of the best retro platformers I have ever come across, and you'll definitely get a kick playing an hour or two with that game versus this potato of a platformer.","December 8, 2014","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/recommended/275490/","Seranth","Seranth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/","1189 products in account","Generic, casual, simple platformer with no story. You start in the middle of the level and then jump around collecting the required items (and bonus items for extra score) and avoid (instead of kill) enemies. After collecting the items, a portal appears that you need to find and leave before time runs out. Score is somewhat important because you need to have enough stars (up to 3 given per level based on score) to unlock the next batch of 10 levels. For example, to unlock the 4th world you need 22 stars from 10 levels (which means you need to score at least eight 2-star levels and two 3-star levels).\n\nThere isn't much variety in levels or objectives- you always have to collect stuff and then exit before time runs out. Music and sound effects are silly but mediocre- I just muted the game and listened to something else while I played.\n\nControls are decent, and the only thing you can do is move and jump. After clearing all ten levels of a batch, you unlock a character to use. Each character has their own power, though so far they haven't been very game-changing. The starter character shows an arrow pointing towards the exit portal. The second shows arrows towards the last remaining gems on the map, the third has magnet-powers for coins, and the fourth ignores fireballs. There are enemies, but you can mostly ignore them. It takes a bunch of hits to kill you, so the main thing they do is slow you down and knock you off platforms. Falling into lava is insta-death, though you always respawn (though it means more wasted time).\n\nThere are definitely more complex and fun platformers around, but maybe this could be okay for someone who is looking for a basic collect-things platformer or as a brain-dead way to pass the time. Not for everyone, since there are many platformers out there.","April 1, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

More importantly, why are you potato?\n\nCanyon Capers is your classic platformer, except you're allowed to get hit more than once and (from what I've seen so far) allowed to die infinite times, which defeats the purpose of all the extra hearts that you can find lying around the stages.\n\nDying is not the kicker though. Your real enemy is the clock.\nIf time runs out before you can gather all the items, you'll have to start over collecting everything for that stage, which can range from "Oh, that's not so bad" to "FML".\n\nOne of my personal least favorite platformers to date is a game called 8BitBoy.\nSo when I saw this game, I said to myself "Huh...will this game make me appreciate 8BitBoy...!?"\n\nI went into playing Canyon Capers expecting to be monstrously more disastrous than the other indie platformer I've mentioned, and honestly...it wasn't as bad as I expected, but it's still pretty terrible.\n\nI expected this game to one shot you and make you start over from the very beginning, but this game is actually kind enough to start you back up from where you last stood a few seconds ago, which is something I really appreciate over 8BitBoy's death mechanics.\n\nHowever, two of the biggest turn offs in this game are the designs for this game and the SFX.\nDesigns amazingly look worse when in motion versus looking at them through screenshots, and the SFX is something to be undesired.\n\nWhen you jump on snakes, they make fart noises.\nI don't know why that's even a thing.\n\nIt was amusing for the first snake or two, but then I got incredibly annoyed by the noise immediately.\nAnd then there's the BLBLBLBLBL SFX when you get hit. Just as annoying as the fart noises, and it comes more frequently as you progress.\n\nIn the end, I came here expecting to be disappointed, and the results did not disappoint.\n\nSo yeah. Unless you're just here for the steam cards, stay away from this game.\nAnd if you were planning to buy this, definitely stay away from this game, and save that money to buy something more worthy.\n\nYou want a retro platformer with challenges that badly?\nLook up "You have to win the game."\n\nThat game is free on steam, and is by far one of the best retro platformers I have ever come across, and you'll definitely get a kick playing an hour or two with that game versus this potato of a platformer.","December 8, 2014","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Canyon Capers feels like a flash game. Like, a poorly designed flash game at that. You run and jump, you pick up collectables, you reach the end of the level. That's it. I realize games like this were rather popular a while back, on sites like Newgrounds and in truly retro-style games on NES, but... There's a reason we've evolved beyond this crud. Games that try to pull off retro need to be able to do something satisfying, fun, or interesting, like Fez or VVVVVV. It compensates for the pixely and simple design. Mindlessly collecting ♥♥♥♥ isn't satisfying. Linear progression through jump puzzles isn't fun. Lifeless music and bland character models with no plot isn't interesting.\n\nI usually play a game for two hours before deciding whether to shelf it or continue. I couldn't make it past half an hour.

The pixel-perfect precise landings and floaty character control will frustrate you to no end. Projectiles will knock you back a whole yard, some you can't even avoid. There are some cheap enemy and hazardous object placement you're not even able to prevent. Some platforming is time consuming, and it wouldn't be a bad thing if the character control wasn't floaty and you wouldn't be knocked back by some enemy you aren't able to avoid, making you complete the same minute-long platform again. The enemy hit-boxes are way too huge and imprecise. Try jumping on the next platform without inflicting damage from the enemy above you, it's tedious. Enemies respawn, and if you happen to be directly on top of their spawn zone, you're going to inflict inevitible damage, which was a common scenario for my play through. There's almost no redeemable quality to the platforming mechanics.\nCanyon Capers tries way too hard to be cute, it ends up looking hidious and disgusting. I have a Dino trading card, and it's artwork looks disgusting, something I wouldn't trade to my worst enemy. The card even reads: "Dino Jr. our The hapless hero.".\nThe music makes me want to gouge my eardrums out with a fork.

I realize games like this were rather popular a while back, on sites like Newgrounds and in truly retro-style games on NES, but... There's a reason we've evolved beyond this crud. Games that try to pull off retro need to be able to do something satisfying, fun, or interesting, like Fez or VVVVVV. It compensates for the pixely and simple design. Mindlessly collecting ♥♥♥♥ isn't satisfying. Linear progression through jump puzzles isn't fun. Lifeless music and bland character models with no plot isn't interesting.\n\nI usually play a game for two hours before deciding whether to shelf it or continue. I couldn't make it past half an hour. Avoid like the plague --and that goes for you too, fans of platformer and retro games. There's so much more out there that deserves your money.","January 23, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Which, by the way, got me a couple cents, from the cards.\n\nI don't find it that inappropriate, though. The "farting" sound that sounds off when 'killing' (enemies never actually die - they respawn) enemies doesn't sound very inappropriate.\n\nSo, what's good? The cards (if you got the game for free).
