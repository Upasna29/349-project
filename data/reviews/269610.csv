EARLY ACCESS. While yes the game was just added to Steam today and it is a very early alpha build I found the game to be enjoyable. The game may be lacking in things to do but again that is because of EARLY ACCESS. Buying the game at this point is supporting the game and giving money to the developer to help push development faster and further.\n\nWith that said my experience in the game was very enjoyable. I played for about an hour and twenty minutes. There are about 12 spells to find and unlock currently. To do that there are altars or events that happen on a map and you complete them using the spells you already have. You then unlock newer , more powerful spells.  I played around with the water and the volcano for a long time. It was a lot of fun.\n\nThere is a small amount of combat in the game right now and I can't say whether or not it will be a combat centered game. However you can place a castle down and your ... well bear like things go out and collect what appears to be a resource of some kind.  You can also find a spell to place guard towers down.  Ultimately you are to find the portal on the map by doing all the objectives and it opens up new worlds to choose from and explore.\n\nFor a early access game, this early in development It was very enjoyable. The developer plans to add more spells and other very cool features and mechanics to the game as time permits.\n\nIs it worth the price? Definitely! Check this one out. As for a Early Access score ? I will wait as I want to play it more but I love my first impression of this game.","January 28, 2014","true","1.2"," 210 of 269 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","210","269","2","0"

If ever... It took them almost half a year to release 1 small update. I doubt this game will ever reach its full potential, though I hope for whoever still cares that it will.\n\n(23/02/15): The game seems to be abandoned for a few months now. The last update was in september 2014, haven't heared from this game since... I don't know if anything is happening behind the scenes, but progress has been very slow even back then. At the time of writing, there is barely anything to do to even concider buying this game.\n\nEDIT (23/02/15): I just found out that the developer has been working on another title. Starting a new project before finishing the first one and thus temporary abandoning this game, probably forever (since it's an one-man company), say's alot about the lack professionalism.\n\nEDIT 2 (23/02/15): I found a review about this game here on Steam with a very unprofessional response from the developer. This made me decide not to buy anything from this developer again in the future. http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueRaja/recommended/269610/\n\nEDIT 3 (18/03/15): It seems that the game is not completely abondoned because they recently released a small update. However, this did take them almost half a year... This will probably be my last edit if the general state of the game stays as it is right now.","February 23, 2015","false","4.2"," 75 of 91 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","75","91","0","4"

In the intervening two decades nobody has taken up the gauntlet and offered up such a destructable world. It's not bullet holes and burn marks slapped up when you miss but burning trees and craters gouged out of the landscape. Even though the roster of spells is only about half filled the expectation is there; There is no problem that can't be solved with some magic.\n\nThe developer is doing everything right and I can't imagine early access on steam was an easy decision.  I have no doubts that single player will eventually become a fully realized spiritual successor to the Magic Carpet style of gameplay. The frustrating part of this is going to be waiting while the developer keeps up the same quality job implementing the rest of the game. Looking forward to each new update adding Spells or other game play features,  and since I am sure the Dev will be sick of it not going to compare Arcane Worlds to Magic Carpet again. But it really is well done and unique with a great sense of art design.\n\nPros\nWhat's there works, and is a professional job! Single Player, the Spells that are currently present, creatures, magic portals, multiple worlds, and the redoing the landscaping all work and every single part of that looks great.\n\nCons\nIt's very early access. Only about half of the spells are in place, an odd choice of mana collector models, and a bare minimum of creatures to provide mana. Also there is no "dungons & dragons" style story or missions in place yet so frankly it's very very early access at this point. The biggest problem is the simple fact that the game is early access and not "done".\n\n","January 29, 2014","true","8.7"," 66 of 93 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","66","93","0","0"

Look no further than Arcane Worlds.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the cheat options.  While I lasted at least 20 minutes before succumbing to the temptation, I found that the game is so lacking in features that I had little else left to do besides cheat.  Once you give yourself the mana cheat and the ALL SPELLS cheat....  Rapid-fire volcanology awaits!  Many other available spells vie for your interest as well, but they all pale in comparison to the mighty volcano spell.\n\nSO.... $10 for a quality physics simulator which (I have not yet been able to crash, although I can drop framerate to abysmal levels) where I get to turn the entire world into a volcano over the course of an hour and a half?  Count me in!\n\nPlayers:  You are ALREADY getting a quality physics fluids simulator in a procedurally generated (rather small/wrapping) world for just $10.  Go for it.  This is more entertaining and less buggy than a LOT of other crap out there on Steam (and other ware stores).\n\nTo the dev:  Well done sir!  Now you face the daunting task of adding meaningful gameplay to this fantastic world simulator you have created.  I wish you the best of luck and encourage players to follow this game closely as things develop.","February 1, 2014","true","1.6"," 38 of 57 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","38","57","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theindieverse/recommended/269610/","theindieverse","The Indieverse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theindieverse/","8 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIn 1994, Bullfrog entertainment released Magic Carpet, a game where you flew about on, you guessed it, a magic carpet. The game became a cult classic, but besides the sequel Magic Carpet 2, no similar games were made. 20 years later, developer Ranmantaru games attempts to fill that void with a spiritual successor called Arcane Worlds.\n\nAs of now, only the framework of Arcane Worlds is done. Its only game mode throws you into a world with a small tutorial, where the basics of collecting mana and creating spells are explained. You then discover a portal, by which you can travel to other randomly generated planets. During these visits you collect treasures that serve as ingredients for creating new spells, that range from a simple lightning bolt to the ability to create an erupting volcano.\n\nHaving never played the original Magic Carpet, I had no real reference point, which means that I can’t compare it to the Bullfrog classic. What I can tell you however, is that the controls feel tight and responsive. Flying around is a breeze and more importantly, fun. Playing around with the various spells, slaying monsters and terraforming as you please, is also very entertaining. But after an hour or so you stumble upon the real problem of Arcane Worlds: that this entertainment doesn’t last forever.\n\nAfter exploring a couple of planets, you’ve seen everything that Arcane Worlds currently offers. Shooting fireballs at flocks of birds becomes stale surprisingly quickly, and the terraforming is too rough around the edges to be fully enjoyed. The fact that the developer has put the development of the game on hold in favour of other projects, doesn’t help its case.\n\nBut then again, I’m not the target audience of Arcane Worlds. This project isn’t meant for people who weren’t even born when the original came out: it’s a love letter of one devoted fan, aimed at other, similarly dedicated fans of Magic Carpet. As of right now, I can only recommend Arcane Worlds to gamers who want to support the development of a HD version of Magic Carpet.  Otherwise, I’d recommend waiting until full release.\n\nYou can find the video on my channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDIjyIMaly4\n","April 3, 2015","false","1.2"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","1"

It looked like an awesome idea and that's about all I went on when I bought it.\n\nThis game really surprised me though. I played it way too long for its actual gameplay. I guess it's because of the thrill of exploring an uncharted world, the need to get more spells to be even more powerful and see the absolute chaos that your power can bring to the world. To be able to shape it in any way that you want. I mean let's be honest here... Who wouldn't want to be a powerful mage soaring through the sky, killing evil black things that are hostile and gaining more powers as you explore new worlds?\n\nI for one am pleased, for once, that I followed my 'ooooo shiny' impulse.

A fun one at that. The game consists of terrain alteration, nothing else.\n\nWell, in this state, you really have no idea how this game will end up, considering it is still in early access. There aren't many features offered currently, which is a bit disappointing, but it is in early access after all. The game even offers you cheats via the pause menu. I enabled these after spending some time playing around with the base game. The cheats make Arcane Worlds a lot more fun. Sure, there's going to be some legit ways to unlock all of the spells offered, but it sure is fun to spam volcanoes all over the world.\n\nI for one, spent all of my time screwing up the world beyond repair. I had volcanoes reach the clouds, then put waterfalls on the sides of them. I made a very, very deep pit that slowly filled with lava as I placed volcanoes around it. The whole world was a scorched, lava-filled mess by the time I was done with it. I should mention that there are entities in the game such as birds and these giant, smiling bears that serve no purpose, but as it stands, they don't really do much in terms of gameplay.\n\nIf you're looking for some quick fun, with no real goal in mind, then check out Arcane Worlds.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPS4skfr5sk","February 8, 2014","true","0.7"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","19","31","0","0"

The last update was in March, which is semi-recent, but there were many months lapse between the previous update.\n\nArcane Worlds is a spiratul successor to Magic Carpet - it has the base mechanics of flight, mana gathering, castle building combat, and portal usage, but not too much else. After I finished the tutorial of the first world, I moved on to the second world which had enemies that I couldn't kill quick enough due ot a lack of mana with my fireball. I had to wait for the mana to recharge so I could finally build a castle to then collect dropped mana from birds I could kill. Of course, attacking the birds made a HUGE swarm of birds attack me, follow me across the entire map and kill me at least twice. They aren't hard to kill, but you have a slow-ish fireball that can be fired about 2 shots per second and takes up mana. You can't just pick up mana, but must have your....bear friends pick up mana by casting a claim mana spell on drops. Basically, I'd kill a dozen birds, try to survive and clumsily restore mana, then turn around and repeat at least 5 times. I didn't feel any satisfaction from the combat (since the monsters still wouldn't die after plenty of hits which are tough to land) and the map didn't appear to have any pick ups to advance. The game felt clearly unfinished and I lost all interest.\n\nAfter reading reviews, updates, and comments, I get the impression that the developer sees this project as a "side hustle" - another way to earn some cash. This doesn't appear to be some primary project that is worked on a regular basis, and instead a way to get money and MAYBE be encouraged to actually work on the game regularly. What is worse is that the dev has started another game in early access for purchase while this game is NO WHERE NEAR FINISHED AS EXCLAIMED FROM THE DEV HIMSELF WHEN YOU START A NEW GAME. The icing on the cake is the Patreon page to support the development of their games.\n\nAlso, let me give you this excerpt when somebody sakd when the game will be finished:\n\nThat depends on how much time I have to work on it. Which isn't much for now since I have a part-time job to pay my bills.\nBasically, a major problem with Early Access is that some devs don't see this as a way to make a solid product, but hope people will support them financially. Valve needs ot find a way to remove that mindset of early access devs.","April 6, 2015","false","0.3"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","2"

Progress on the game might not be fast given that there is only one developer but it is certainly steady and v0.25 is almost like a different game to v0.19 now. One of the first major surprises for me was just how much better the randomly generated worlds looked after the generation code was revamped to build the worlds around the gameplay elements rather than the other way around. Before colours were mostly the same and random terrain was sort of thrown together. Now you will find pillars, lakes, valleys, forests and more with proper palettes that all fit together very well in making a believable and natural-looking random world. Couple those elements with terrain effecting spells like Fracture and Volcano you can actually have a lot of fun just terraforming worlds and customising them to your liking.\n\nSpells are no longer found randomly on worlds like previous builds and instead you will find runes which you use on crafting worlds to create new spells. This gives you some early goals to work towards as different spells require different runes so you have to scavenge worlds for the rune types needed for the spells you want. Certain worlds will be easier to conquer if you have the right spells and certain puzzles might require a specific spell to solve.\n\nA much-needed interactive tutorial has been added so anybody not already familiar with the old Magic Carpet games will now have the basic movement, combat and crafting mechanics explained to them. You don't get everything handed to you on a plate though so you still have to figure out what those circles are and what to do with them.\n\nSeveral improvements to the map make locating items on worlds much more easily. Un-triggered circles are marked as are creatures and mana gatherers and there is a line back to your castle so navigating is much easier. In the universe map you can also check if you have missed anything on worlds you have visited which is pretty useful.\n\nDifficulty has increased on v0.25 as your starting mana is now lower and you can't just rain fireball death on enemies right away so you have to fly more evasively until you have added some mana to your castle allowing you to sustain your fire rate for longer periods. Dark worlds are a new addition and whilst I don't want to ruin the surprise I will say that poorly prepared Wizards are going to have a bad time in these! One of my early criticisms of the game was that it was a little too easy and creatures offered no real threat to you which is now being addressed.\n\nThe game is also moddable which is fairly unusual for an alpha-build game. The scripts in the /gen/ folder are not only responsible for world generation but also the gameplay elements so there is a lot that can be done to tweak and customise the game. There isn't much in the way of documentation (or even comments) so the difficulty curve for modding is currently quite high but I expect this to change as the game develops further.\n\nArcane Worlds is a truly amazing experience for an alpha and I can't recommend it enough regardless of whether you ever played Magic Carpet or not.\n\nI should point out that as the game is DRM-free many people (including myself) usually aren't logged into Steam when I play so the "played" hours count (3.5) is far from correct for me at least. I think I will have to change that!","October 24, 2014","true","8.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It certainly got more potential and it doesn't look like it was made for an iPad. At the moment its on a very early stage of development, you've got few basic spells to change the landscape and only few offensive spells. While there isn't much to do right now apart from killing several enemies and harvesting mana you can already get a feel of what it could be when its finished - a proper remake of "Magic Carpet" series and a decent godsim.\n\nIts hard to believe that Molyneux made "Magic Carpet" once and other amazing simulators before he went off the rails.","August 13, 2014","true","0.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

I played through quite a few levels until I encountered what seems like a game-breaking bug ( I am stuck in the world, none of the pedestals can be activated by movement, fire, or anything and no portal is available to leave the world ); while in early-access I can see something like this happening, but it should be far enough along where this doesn't happen..\n\nAside from the game-breaking bug, things are moving in the right direction so I look forward to revisiting this review once more in the near future.\n\nCurrent Pros:\n++ They're making progress with development and adding new features.\n++ The world selection screen seems like a bonus which will make game-play more dynamic instead of being the same worlds each time ( extra bonus if procedurally generated ).\n+ AI Creatures now attack you.\n+ Able to cast "Claim Mana" spell so mana isn't automatically yours ( meaning it can be stolen when AI is added )\n+ Able to create new spells with collected crystals instead of simply finding spells as in the original Magic Carpet ( Although I have yet to find a place to create spells in any of the maps; the tutorial said to do it at the alter, and I revisited the first map to try it and still had no luck so this will also be mentioned in cons )\n\nCurrent Cons:\n-- MAJOR: Game-Breaking Bug which leaves your only available save-game stuck in a world without being able to activate any alters, or portals, etc... ( I've tried everything, even burning the entire map )..\n- Unable to create new spells outside of fireball from the tutorial, even after coming back to the original map and alter.\n- Combat feels too easy.. ( Let me rephrase, while receiving "damage" is a "HUGE" event, you don't seem to be able to die or whatever... )\n- Worlds seem quite small.\n- World textures seem low-quality / worlds don't appear as detailed as the original Magic Carpet ( Bonus, I found my old CD of Magic Carpet 2, I'll see if I can get it running and upload screenshots or videos )...\n- You can't see the carpet you're on.\n- The levels are still repetitive.\n- There are still no AI players.\n- You can not expand your castle ( meaning you're stuck with one center "building" and a wall with 4 towers, one at each corner ).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOriginal Review\n\nAs of right now I can't recommend it in good faith. While they claim it's a newer version of Magic Carpet ( I own Magic Carpet; and I have the original disks ), it's not quite the same. It is currently early access, so they'll be up for another review closer to release.\n\nMagic carpet allowed you to fight an enemy, right from the ~second level. When you killed a creature, gold mana balls would drop down. You'd need to cast a spell on them to claim those mana balls as your own. Once you cast the spell ( Spam right clicking ), your hot-air-balloons would come pick them up. Enemy carpeteers could claim your mana if it wasn't picked up yet. If it was picked up ( if I recall correctly ) they could destroy the hot-air-balloon and take it. This was much more challenging that this game currently is.\n\nI'd thought about making a clone of Magic Carpet for the longest time; but I didn't. Depending how this game turns out, I may create my own.\n\nThe water effect is not that great; monsters spawn in out of nowhere; you get the same spells over and over and over again; after playing for several hours ( on the pre-desura and pre-steam release ) I left the game, came back and it was fine. I tried loading the game and my save was gone. All spells, all levels, everything - albeit not much because it's still early access. The monsters don't look that great, I'm hoping they'll add a lot more polish to the game as it progresses.\n\nIt has potential, but as of right now the early release is over-priced albeit by the end, if done properly, I could see this being a $20-25 title.","April 11, 2014","false","1.8"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","4"

The developer is actively working on the project and there's a lot of potential. As it is right now, the game is pretty bare bones. You have access to basic terrain shaping tools, which, for anyone who's ever played From Dust, will seem very familiar. You can also kill birds and wyverns using your fireball spells. In addition to that, you have access to the cheat menu, which gives you a lot more control over the world. Campaign wise, there's little here, but that doesn't really matter for the moment. Being able to shape and alter terrains, and take the odd potshot at the local bird population, is a lot more entertaining than it sounds.","March 23, 2014","true","0.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It`s just "kill monsters, gather manna, build a castle , rinse, repeat".\n\nIt needs a goal.\n\nAnd it also seems to me from other comments and the long wait without any major changes, that it`s been abandoned, which is a shame as it has potential.","March 15, 2015","false","18.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Which is why I have so little play time. I recently just got a new computer, so I tried this game again. From what I have seen in my short play time, this game certainly has a lot of potential. The worlds are pretty, and movement feels nice, but the game is just a little tiny. Worlds are basically mini pocket dimmensions that you could loop through in just a few seconds, still very cool looking. And just because they're small, doesn't mean there isn't room to explore.
