I got through the first 3 maps, and never felt that feeling of joy when playing a new game. The game had very basic mechanics, so it shouldn't be hard to learn for any new player, but it also leaves it wanting in the tactical department. You can use your dragon to shoot enemies, and choose the path for your cavalry, but otherwise you have no control over battles, not even in setting up where you want a type of troops to start. I don't believe this is a $9 game, it feels more like a $3 game, and I couldn't recommend it to anyone.","January 28","false","0.3"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

It's a pretty simple little game where you have a limited amount of turns to explore an over world, raising an army, and conquering kingdoms. The combat is mostly AI driven, so power in numbers takes precedence.\n\nThe strategy involved is mostly micromanaging your turns. Do you use your limited amount of time to explore and conquer, or do you double back to previous bases to raise a larger army? It's simple to jump in, but thoughtful enough to be enjoyable.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdcPzfTqBtQ\nThe graphics and sounds won't win any awards. Though the sprites aren't ugly by any means, the overall presentation takes a more utilitarian approach to it's graphics than artistic.\n\nOverall 10 Minute Barbarian was a simple, but enjoyable little game.\n\nPros:\n- Easy to understand mechanics\n- hundreds of units combating at once\n- Thoughtful rules makes the simple mechanics satisfying\n\nCons:\n- Not the prettiest of games\n- Could be too simple for some","January 28","true","1.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SnakeInTheEyes/recommended/389120/","SnakeInTheEyes","Danken Duncan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SnakeInTheEyes/","805 products in account","The game is pretty simple, you are a barbarian that runs across villages and castles to gather men, and then you use your army to conquer other villages and castles to gain more men (and unite the kingdom against the demons). That's about 85% of the gameplay.\n\nLater on in the game you'll find a dragon among the enemy that shoots fireballs at your men. Kill the dragon and you can recruit them for yourself and use them to shoot at the enemy. That's another 10%.\n\nEven further in the game you'll find cavalry that you need to tell what to do, meaning you need to tell them to charge at point 1 and then point 2 before the battle starts. This leads to them running past the enemies to point 2, unless they are blocked. Then they attack the closest enemy, which can be a wall or an actual enemy. You also get a banner that you can use in battle to guide your men, kind of anyways. Both of these are generally useless and when you can find a for use it, it won't make much of a difference. This is the last 5%.\n\nYou can finish this game in about three hours on standard difficulty and honestly you only need to finish the first map, out of a total of ten, to experience the entire game.\n\nThe time played compared to the price paid (€9) and the gameplay itself aren't sufficient to justify a purchase.\nDuring a sale it might be worth to check it out if your looking for a casual strategy game.","January 29","false","3.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You start off with your Barbarian, and then slowly start to explore the map, gathering troops from nearby villages or castles.  As you grow in power you will be able to take on enemy forts, and if you are able to defeat them, they switch to your side.  Each time you move is a turn.  The different towns and castles you control have a current number of troops and a maximum number of troops, they slowly replenish as you take your turns until capping out.  In addition, you have gold you find during your exploration that allows you to up the maximum number of troops you can hold in your army, as well as, how many dragons you have.  There's a balance you must find between exploring too far too fast and wasting turns doubling back to build up your army, and just building up without exploiting all of the map.  You have a maximum number of turns (days) before the apocalypse.  Your goal is to defeat all enemy forts and gather enough strength to slay the demons once the apocalypse takes place.\n\nThe battles are fairly simplistic in nature and you have little direct control at first.  Later on into the game, you get a little bit more.  First few battles will have you watching your crazy army of rabble (peasants) charge straight ahead and try to zerg the enemy.  Then you'll add knights and archers to the mix, who tank better and fire arrows, respectively.  Still, they all charge forward with no rhyme nor reason, just bloodlust and anger!  (I have to admit, I love watching the fights, it just makes me grin)  Eventually you'll defeat a dragon guarding a fort and then it will join your army.  You can click on the battlefield where you want the dragon to attack and it will spit a fireball out to murder enemies (or friends if they are too close) in a small aoe.  It's really nice to pick off clusters of archers hiding behind walls.  The next tactical unit you get is the cavalry.  You can position them anywhere on your side of the battlefield and resize their deployment box.  Then you choose two waypoints for them to charge for, allowing you to bypass enemy troops or walls.  They are quite tanky and do a great job of tearing archers apart.  In some maps you get giant walking trees of doom.  They are super tanky, do a very small aoe and are quite a problem for your normal troops, or the enemy's.  You can also unlock a banner in a temple which allows you a bit more direct control over all of your army.  It allows you to click and drag on your army, to redirect them to where you feel they'd be better suited.\n\nOver all the combat is fairly simplistic, yet still quite fun.  Finding the right balance of troops, the right amount of exploring to building up your army, and utilizing your money properly all add to the strategy side of the game.  Is this the most advanced, complex, deep, or difficult strategy game ever made?  Nope.  The game is designed to play each map quickly and still offer strategy, fun, and a sense of accomplishment.  Don't sell it short, it's still quite enjoyable and I'm looking forward to whatever comes next from Wolff Dobson & Studio Puffer.","February 2","true","1.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There’s a Hard difficulty setting if you want the experience to demand more of you, and even a hidden six-star rating that can be tricky to acquire (I have it, of course), but the campaign's brevity is what does the most to keep a player coming back to slay invading demons and put the boot into those pesky necromancers. In theory, the game is the ideal way to kill a quarter-hour of dead time. Just be wary: it has a habit of eating up significantly more of your life than that.\n\nFull Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12841/pc/10-minute-barbarian/review.html","January 27","true","11.9"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","12","23","0","0"

Mid-game you get some units that you can control more, but the battles are more or less autonomous. The controllable units inject a bit of strategy to tip the odds in your favor, namely the dragons that function like mortars, and the calvalry, whom you can direct, but they are relatively few in numbers. Late game, you can get things like the banner which allows you to command a small patch of units - very useful for navigating around walls.\n\nThe majority of the player's strategy comes not on the battlefield, but rather on the overworld map, where the player must balance the decisions of who to fight when, when to collect more troops, and when to face down the odds for a much needed special unit (the necromancers are basically amazing. Pinch your pennies - they cost 5k!)\n\nThe later levels, I found to be a bit closer to "15 minute barbarian", but the title nonetheless sums up the experience nicely; The player is able to pick up the game, play for a relatively few minutes, and get a fix of both strategic play, and watching satisfied as the battles onfold.\n\nGreat work!","January 27","true","3.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Instead of spending hours micromanaging production queues and battle formations, in 10 Minute Barbarian, you get to find out if a disorganized rabble of peasants can storm a castle held by a handful of archers. And when you find out the answer is no, you start over and try again 5 minutes later, this time with twice as many pitchfork-bearing farmers.\n\nYour tactical options in battle are a bit limited, but you are a barbarian, after all, not Rommel. Most of the units act on their own, but some can be given simple marching orders at the beginning of the battle. You also get controllable artillery in the form of dragons, but their fireballs lay waste to foe and friend alike. At least their aim is pixel-perfect, so if you suffer any friendly-fire casualties, you know whose fault it is.\n\nThe 10 maps in the game may seem like a small number, but the scenarios get pretty varied after the first 3 or so levels. Each map has a theme, but the exact layout seems to vary with each game. You also get introduced to new units regularly, and some scenarios play out like little puzzles, requiring you to vary your tactics a bit.\n\nIt's a fun, little game. Just go in expecting a light strategy snack that takes tens of minutes at a time.","January 31","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
