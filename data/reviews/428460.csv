"http://steamcommunity.com/id/twobrokenthumbs/recommended/428460/","twobrokenthumbs","twoBrokenThumbs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/twobrokenthumbs/","230 products in account","Pretty good game.\nApparently this is an adaptation of a physical board game, but I had never heard of it.\nI bought it on a whim yesterday during the steam sale, and for $7.50 I have gotten more than my money's worth. I figure the physical game is 2-3 times that cost so this is a deal no matter what.\n\nSo anyways, I would compare it to the board game Forbidden Island (though I think Forbidden Island is much better) if you are familiar with the mechanics of that game at all.\nBasically you there are events that happen for every set of turns you take. You have to fight the spread of evil and it is just an uphill battle. The momentum of the negative actions that push against you makes your strategy very important, and you will probably lose more times than you win -  but somehow that sense of urgency, speed, and strategy is what makes the feeling of this game great!\nAlso of note is while this game can get intense, it is definitely more of a casual game. It is simple strategy, we aren't talking Civ V here or anything like that. But honestly, I like it more for it's simple, streamlined gameplay rather than being more complex.\n\nMy only knock against the game is that it is single player. If it had a multiplayer component to it I would be pushing this game to everybody saying how great it is. Since that is missing, I'll just simply say it is a good and solid game I highly enjoy. 4/5 stars type thing.\n\nTo comment on the Biblical topic of the game, I think it is done very well.\nThe time period of the Kings is very interesting, and if you are not well versed in your Biblical knowledge go read a Bible - it is fascinating!\nSo to see somebody attempt to tackle this is quite a feat. I think they handled it really well.\nI do wish some more of the details came out in the gameplay. There are some cards that fit with the historical events but it could have been done better. But again, they handled it very well so I'm nitpicking, not complaining.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is a great and fun game - and this is NOT a silly children's game with a Bible theme or poorly done. I would definitely recommend it.\n","December 23, 2015","true","0.8"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","36","42","0","0"

Or you can jump right in via a custom game if you already are familiar with this game.\n\nBut I had never heard of it before seeing it on Steam, so it was a welcome sight for me, as i am an avid board gamer and a Christian. And the game itself has not disappointed me, as it has solid and fun mechanics and enough variety and random elements to keep me wanting to play over and over.","December 21, 2015","true","0.8"," 52 of 72 people (72%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","72","52","72","5","0"

It is great that we've learned some ancient geography, the lineage of Kings, and how to pronounce many Hebrew names, but it the benefits are much more than that. The game itself encourages cooperation. On the harder difficulties it is not possible to win without working and thinking as a team. Further, there is a hidden, Biblical lesson Strategic Spoiler: It doesn't matter how many altars you build or how much sin you preach against, if you don't tear down false idols, you cannot free the kingdom. I'll let you draw your own analogy from this game's parable.\n\nBest of all, the game is fun. There are a lot of "biblical" games out there that are basically trivial pursuit, and no one really wants to play that anymore. As an avid gamer who enjoys cooperative boardgames like Pandemic, I highly recommend this game. I am so glad to get this Steam version so I can play on my own and try out lots of different strategies and permutations.","December 22, 2015","true","0.2"," 28 of 42 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","28","42","4","0"

In my opinion there are equal positives and negatives with this game.\n\nI have every sympathy with the current one negative review, as it rightly points out that if you are not the right type of player for this type of game, the game can become 'boring' and 'difficult' quite quickly to result in a 'dull' experience.  As much as I like board games, perhaps this game does suffer, like some do, that the PC versions of games, designed to be played with friends on a board, just don't translate to excitement for the PC.  By buying this game, you will have to accept the game is difficult, and it's likely, especially early on, you may well lose many more games than what you win.\n\nThe positives of the game:\n\nIt's slightly addictive to keep trying to 'win' the game.  This game is one you can return to when you have half hour spare, to play a game.\n\nThe game has a nice look and feel about it, a nice design, artwork and music background, with no bugs.\n\nIt will appeal to some who have a religion or historical interest that in one (optional) version of the game, it goes into a 'quiz' mode, where you have to answer questions from the Bible about the era that the game is set in.\n\nBecause it's difficult, the game is finely balanced where there's always a tight battle at the end between your prophets and the enemy Kings who keep dropping 'false idols' and 'sin clouds' to counter how hard it is to build your 'alters'.  There are more bad Kings who hinder you, than good Kings who help you, perhaps why the game seems 'difficult'.\n\nThe price is pretty fair to gamers as it's faily low priced, pitched just right in my opinion, especially so in a sale.\n\nOverall: It was a finely balanced decision between whether to keep the game (as it has a nice feel and tense yet frustrating and difficult gameplay) or get a refund (because it may become dull after long bursts).  One thing that swayed me is achievements (not in the game at the time of the review) are set to be introduced soon, thus adding to the challenge on steam.  Not going to be a classic game, but not too bad either, and I applaud the developers attempt to bring board games to the PC, even if this board game can play out a little dull at times.  On balance, it's a 'Yes' (just) to recommending this game.","March 31","true","1.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Just swap out the agents with preachers and the viruses with sins.  That said, this game really adds a number of novel twists to the Pandemic formula.  I think Kings of Israel has a much more interesting resource management system, a wider variety special events (called blessings and curses here), and agent abilities.","December 29, 2015","true","0.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

I get a lot out of the historicity and stories of the Bible, as opposed to the organized worship aspect and rules. This appears to be the only mature Bible game in recent years. It is a Pandemic-style game with differences to keep the concept fresh. The sliding difficulty, random characters, and a random setup make an addictive game.\n\nSince there is so much blowback on organized religion nowadays, I just want to say that there is nothing preachy, babyish, or moralizing about this game- it is more like a historical strategy game than a Bible lesson game. For those who do want a Bible study mode there is a Bible trivia mode. Bible games have had a label of being for kids, poorly done, having simple cartoony stories, or being moralizing. This has none of that.\n\nI really love the design, theme, and playability. It can get pretty intense at times. If the developers could make some additional content, expansions, or other Bible games I would be happy.","February 19","true","5.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I love the tactical challenge and the fast paced play. Combined with the wide variety of events and prophets ensures every game is unpredictable and exciting.\n\nDominion inspired a whole genre of great deck building games like Xenoshyft or Space Food Truck. Likewise, Pandemic has inspired Kings of Israel, but this game offers enough unique and compelling twists that I find myself playing both.","April 23","true","4.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I'm hoping for an option for speedier Sin distribution, though...about half of the time in my game is spent waiting for the sin spread cards to be drawn and appear.  Balance on the game is a bit tough.  I rarely get to Omri without losing (my average game is about 10 minutes long), though I finally won somehow by spamming altars on the last two turns while idols were still present in all of those locations.  The Tutorial should include very direct requirement lists for certain things in the game, e.g. I still am not fully clear on what exactly I need for an altar (1 Wood [Leaf icon], 1 Stone, 1 Gold?).  Shouldn't an idol be smashed before a locational altar be allowable?  I suppose it could make sense either way.\n\nAlso: I'm not sure Achievements are working.  I didn't get the first achievement for winning after I won.  The game also crashed when I chose Exit.\n\nEach game can level you up, but I'm stuck on losing just about every time because my dudes can't preach fast enough.  Still a well-presented game, but I might have balanced it a tiny bit differently and allowed for multiplayer Co-op.","December 25, 2015","true","1.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

What more can you say?\n\nWill this game itself destroy Steam, or will Steam manage to stay away from becoming a sin idol so that the prophets can rest?\n\nThis is the coolest game to come out of the indie market perhaps. And it has Bible Study. In this day and age for us Gamers, especially on Steam, we need this handy game as an aid, with so many ruthless corporations trying to get at our money. And it does just that at a measily seven dollars as of now this Christmas.\n\npros: Fun Bible themed board game, Bible study, someone did an ok job at the artwork, can immerse you to feel like a real prophet of God preaching His Word against the armies of sin, good music, creative game\n\ncons: I just wished that the prophets had names instead of Sailor or Trader, the title screen is great but the layers effect feels cheesed and not that great, for a game being about fighting sin sadly the game isn't as addictive as say for example games that people cannot for the life of them put it down because they're that good such as mmorpgs for example.\n\nMerry Christmas","December 23, 2015","true","2.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"
