It sucks your life out, and then tries to charge you for it.\n\n1. Glitchy and lacking UI in more than a dozen major places.\n2. Lack of diverse and viable content. (due to youth somewhat)\n3. Strong META.\n4. Either grind to win, or pay to win, and tops people pay a lot of money, or macro, to get there. (PvP primarily)\n5. Hardest grind of anything you will ever play. Difficult MMO's seem like a vacation compared to this grind.\n6. Weak end game content. Nothing beyond regular raids, and fighting to get one powerful card in PvP.\n\nConclusion: RUN AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n-\n\nLong judgement:\nWelcome to the grind of your life.\n\nHi,\n\nI started playing this game about two weeks after early release on Steam.\nMy persona is well known in the community.\nThe guild I created quickly rose to the top three or so guilds in the game.\nWe were the first American guild in the game (2nd overall) to down the hardest raid boss, before expansions.\nMy highest elo (PvP rating) was somewhere around 2250-2300 before I started experimenting, and without any uber lords, or paying for cards.\nMy level is 47, if I recall.\n\nMy point is that I know this game well enough to provide an experienced judgement, and my judgement is that this game is basically a complete waste of time and money, if you so choose to invest.\nI've been on ventrilo with friends who just decided to drop $100 or so on boosters, only to get pretty much no useful epics.\nIf you pay, it's extremely expensive, and in either case you have to grind your life away.\nBefore I quit playing, they also made it to where you can attain high level vampire lords with PvP badges that could previously only be unlocked through acquiring a high level.\nSo, now, unless they change it again, there's not much point to leveling except for the in-game currency, which is sort of useless at some point, because you can only buy these really weak packs with it.\n\nThe most viable cards, which are part of the meta, are obtained with in-game currency that can only be acquired if you pay for them with real money. There are people out there who would nay say this, but when you start to consistently fight the top fifteen or so, you see basically the same decks, or very similar decks, over and over again.\nAnd because of the nature of the way that cards play in this game, there is a very high RNG factor.\nOne minute you might beat the best PvP'er in the game, and the next minute lose to some no name with tons of epics who is somewhow five hundred elo below you. It's very gimmicky at odd times.\nMatches are often won within the first three turns or so at competitive levels. It is very much about who makes the first mistake, and has the right answers or standards, rather than who has the most interesting deck, or unique strategy within a deck, or what have you.\n\nThis game is slowly being ported from a brower edition with the same title.\nSo, if you want to see what's coming, look it up on google, and you can see exactly how they're gonna lay it out over time.\n-\nPvE is a mega grind. Most things are not difficult, but they take tons of mind numbing time to accomplish.\nParticularly in leveling.\nSome raid bosses can be a challenge, but not really in a healthy way. In some raids, we're forced to constantly concede the match and restart within the first turn or two, because if you don't get the right hand, there's no point. It's a huge waste of time, and most raiders don't get much of a reward, though there is a chance for some to get a good card.\nEven tough raids can be simplified, but they often take very specific card counters that can be difficult to obtain without unfathomable in-game currencies.\n-\nLet's talk about Guilds.\nThe only point to being in a guild is to do raids, but the system is very poorly designed.\nFirst... you can't raid unless you're at least level 10, and even by then you're probably not ready to even take the first raid boss, though it is possible, of course.\nA guild can have up to 20 members, but each raid boss has to be killed 100 times.\nSo, that means in a 20 person guild, each member can obtain 5pts to completion, evenly.\nThe max per person is 13 pts. Which means that a guild must have a minimum of 8 members.\nThe thing is... each kill gives a chance of loot, faction points, card rewards, and also technically a higher chance at reward cards per individual because of fewer member numbers.\nSo.... why have a bigger guild? It makes no sense. And why have a point system without establishing a feature that can cap each member at a certain point value for the sake of fairness?\nThe whole system is honestly stupid, and needs a significant rework.\n-\nEthics...\nPublic discussions have occurred on the in-game chat with the game's maker on their philosophy, business, design, and exercises in ethics, leading me, and some others to believe that the way that they do things is not entirely professional on multiple levels.\nTo say the least.\n\nI have witnessed Alithia (game maker) and about three other players role playing a bondage porn scene in all chat.\nThat particular situation began over a discussion from a succubus-like card, or something like that.\nNeedless to say, that made me pretty uncomfortable, and since the game maker was in on it, I couldn't really report it to anyone, or say anything about it; and behavior like that is common of Alithia.\n\nDesigners should be friendly, diplomatic, and somewhat neutral, but when they behave like that it's unacceptable.\nInput from the community is also, generally, not received well. You will sooner be met with a crappy defense for their choices, rather than any real change.\n\n-\nConclusion:\nI could rant forever about the problems in this game, and why I quit.\nBut finally, I'd like to say that after more than 500 hours invested, though I have made some good gaming buddies, this game is just not rewarding. Frankly... it owes me money for the time, and life force, I put into it. hahaha\n\nA good CCG or TCG or DCG or w/e consists of diversity to the end of creative expression through strategem.\nNighbanes is a browser cash cow, and given enough time and chance it is sure to disappoint you, as well.

The combat is quick, and has some decent strategy. While most of it is automated, you choose a single card to play each turn. This has more depth than it sounds, although not as much as in other card games.\n\nUltimately, this game is pay to win. Just because you can theoretically unlock every card does not change anything. In practice, the time investment needed to unlock cards is astronomical. You will need to beat each AI character upwards of 20 times to unlock its goodies. Sometimes more. There are no cosmetic purchases in the cash shop - all of it is purchasing cards to give you an edge. I should also mention that even if you pay, expect to do large amounts of grinding.\n\nThe starter decks, while decent in PvE for the start, are nowhere close to being competitive. You cannot compete in PvP without a significant time investment (think Korean MMO grinds), or money. There is no other option. At the moment, there aren't any drafting modes either.\n\nIn all, the game isn't bad if you don't mind paying or playing at a disadvantage for a large span of time. The "horror" theme might appeal to you as well. For an average guy who would lke to compete in a card game without a significant money or time investment, this isn't the game for us.","March 31, 2015","false","10.2"," 70 of 99 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","70","99","0","10"

However, in the interest of sustaining intellectual honesty, I can still not in good conscience change my review to a thumbs up, because I still cannot honestly call Nightbanes a "good game". Lots of people like crap stuff, the existence of McDonalds, the Michael Bay Transformers movies and Call of Duty is proof of that, and Nightbanes is not without its virtues.\n\nCollecting new cards and refining your deck is just as satifying as always; rather, the extreme difficulty of obtaining certain power cards makes doing so even more satisfying than in other CCGs. Finally crafting that Bone Berserker or Grand Lich, reaching the required PvP rank to unlock that Black Warg or faction rank to unlock that Chainsaw Katana, getting that Stargazer Grove to drop from Natalia or that Flame Vampire as a Raid reward from Oblivion Emperor- these are all far more exciting than just getting lucky with the contents of a booster. This is particularly important as the game is EXTREMELY stingy with boosters- except for the small amounts of Blood Rubies you can earn from PvE quest completions, Raid rewards and the daily login bonus, you can only buy full boosters with Blood Diamonds (real-money currency) and the best Blood Pearls (free currency) can get you is Base Light boosters, which only contain 3 commons (from a STUPIDLY small pool of common cards) and 1 uncommon which has a tiny chance of being a rare (and NO chance of being an Epic or Legendary). Furthermore, these Light boosters are ONLY available for the base set, meaning the expansions (with all the OP power creep cards they contain) have to be got the slow way, with Rubies, or the expensive way, with Diamonds. Compared to the absurd generosity of games like SolForge or Infinity Wars, which literally shower you with free cards, Nightbanes is unquestionably the stingiest "F2P" CCG I've ever seen.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are the absolute definition of "simple but elegant". With interactivity reducted to the absolute bare minimum -choosing a single card from your hand to play each turn, or using your once-per-game Lord power- there is still a remarkable amount of depth available. Even though you can't direct your creatures' attacks or choose targets for your abilities, mastery lies in grasping the order that actions will resolve to establish control over the board. And more than a little luck. Actually I'll be honest: a lot of luck. No, let's be completely honest about 90% luck. The consequence of the game's absolute simplification of mechanics is that over half the cards in the game have at least SOME aspect of RNG involved with them, whether it's abilities with a "chance" of activating each turn or that affect random targets, and combined with the RNG inherent in all CCGs roughly 90% of the game is RNG-based. If you have bad luck, this game is going to be an unpleasant experience.\n\nIt's also shamelessly pay-to-win. Well, not exactly shamelessly; the lengths they go to in an attempt to deny it show that they're quite averse to being labeled as such, but it's simply not a matter of opinion, it's a simple fact. Svereal of the most powerful cards can ONLY be obtained with Blood Diamonds and, unlike a lot of CCGs, there is NO way whatsoever of obtaining Blood Diamonds other than buying them with money. The cards you unlock for completing bosses or reaching player levels give you a single copy when you unlock them, but if you want any more copies (and you will) you'll have to fork out. At least they caved in and distributed the "Premium" cards they proudly display on the storefront randomly in the boosters, but their drop rate is EXTREMELY low, many of them are FAR more powerful than most normal rares (especially the unique 100-diamond superpremiums, which cost more than three entire boosters) and any other player can just buy them as single cards if they're willing to, well, pay to win.\n\nThe P2W situation is somewhat alleviated by an epiphany I had about the game's nature, though: unlike almost every other CCG in existence, the primary focus of the game is NOT PvP, but PvE. PvP doesn't even give you anything except 1-3 Blood Badges, used to buy certain exclusive cards, and Elo rank which unlocks more powerful reward cards. You don't even get a pittance of exp for winning a PvP match- almost everything you need is earned in PvE matches against the AI, Blood Pearls, Blood Rubies, experience, faction points and loot drops. The Guild Raid system where you and your guildmates take on ridiculously overpowered bosses to earn poweful rewards only emphasises the fact that the main focus of the game is the PvE grind to improve your decks. However, there's WAY too much emphasis on "grind". The first PvE opponent requires you to beat them 4 times to unlock the next one; by the time you get to the end of area 4 you need to beat the last opponent more than seventy times to unlock the area boss. The developers grasp of PvE content really doesn't go any further than "play these AI opponents over and over and over again." That's literally it. The AI is incredibly stupid too, literally just playing a random card every turn (such as an ability that will destroy your equipment when you dont have any equipment on the board) and yet STILL manages to be incredibly annoying at higher levels thanks to their insanely overpowered unique abilities. Ultimately, the only real way to beat is simply to have stronger cards. Also, going back to the Guild system for a moment, the system is INCREDIBLY bodgy and half-baked- bosses need to be beaten 100 times to be cleared and give rewards, but each member of the guild can only beat them 13 times each, while players who miss out on their chance to beat them (once Oblivion Emperor went down while I was asleep, causing me to miss out) can't fight them any more once they're "finished". It needs a LOT of changes.\n\nProbably the best aspect of the game is the community. Despite the chat system being buggy, flakey, and missing features as fundamental as a chat filter (I once got instantly permabanned for using the wrong Naughty Word in chat, although I was able to get that revoked at least) the players are generally friendly and helpful to each other (something that REALLY helps compensate for the hopelessly inadequate tutorial). Advice flows freely, people banter with each other, sympathise with the frustrations of certain opponents and congratulate each other whenever they beat a particularly nasty boss or get a particularly fine card. However, the game's PR rep, Alithia, is really bad at her job, being evasive about mechanics questions, trolling the community and outright MOCKING players who makes complaints about the game in chat, regardless of how justified they are. She's terribly unprofessional and honestly should be replaced.\n\nUltimately, Nightbanes is a mess. It's a genuinely bad game, being ridiculously grindy, absurdly stingy, APPALLINGLY RNG-dependant to the point of being utterly infuriating and at times just plain boring. But if you're an obsessive compulsive collector with a taste for gothic horror (like me) it has at least some appeal and can function as a decent time sink. However, yesterday my friend asked my why I was still playing it when I'd previously slagged the game off so badly for its flaws and I had to confess to him that I had absolutely no idea. Approach with caution.","April 3, 2015","false","118.5"," 45 of 70 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","45","70","4","0"

However, given the opportunity to try out Nightbanes, I first shrugged it off, deciding I wouldn't like it. But in the end, I figured I didn't have anything to lose by just giving it a quick try.\n\nAnd I'm very glad I did!\n\nI'm very likely a terrible player, my strategies are probably completely wrong, and I wouldn't dream of playing against a real person. But, I can't deny how much fun I had.\n\nWith that said, I can't say much for the player vs. player aspect of the game. However the quest system is interesting and fun. You'll battle against different opponents with different strategies and cards. Despite not being very good at the strategy myself, I did often have to shuffle around my cards to find a winning combination against each of them.\n\nI played through the first area of quests with just the basic starter cards.  It was challenging, but if it wasn't, it wouldn't be very fun now, would it?  You also earn in game currency and cards themselves from playing quests.\n\nAfter playing with the starter cards for awhile, I used some of the in game currency generously provided for just the beta to see where you could go with it. You can level up cards, as well as evolve them, which I actually found rather interesting. I found myself leveling up and evolving my favorite cards. Now that the game is officially released and all accounts reset, I admit, I'm rather going to miss my cards. =(\n\nWhat I find to be good things about the game, others may dislike. I have a feeling seasoned card game players will find this too easy, which is the exact reason I liked it. I tried a few other popular card games on Steam after playing this one, but I couldn't get into them.\n\nIs the game pay-to-win? Most certainly, if you have the money, you could easily obtain a fairly unbeatable set of cards.  I know everything can be unlocked via playing, however I imagine that would take an extremely long time.  I do feel like the in-game currency may be over-priced.  Between buying a card and leveling it, you could easily spend upwards of 20 dollars on a single card.\n\nI wish I could rate this neutrally, I had fun playing it, but, I think some balancing needs to be done.  In the end, it's free to try it out, so you really don't have anything to lose.","March 30, 2015","true","3.5"," 57 of 92 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","57","92","4","0"

Yes, you do have the option to buy diamonds and pay anywhere from 10 to 60 diamonds for cards if you do not want to wait. However, if you grind quests for rubies, you can spend them on booster packs, or use pearls to by the base light deck. The game is nothing like Hearthstone and that it's rather unique and fun. You have the option to be in a guild to complete raids; kill bosses and get cards that way as well. Plus you can get the cards from pvp by earning badges. The pvp in there has a variety of cards too! This is a card collecting game, and you are constantly changing and building your deck. Plus you have the option to upgrade cards and evolve them as well.\n\nThe game is rather fun, but you do have to grind in here, so if you don't like the grinding experiance you may night like this game.

Once you overwhelm your opponent, you win. That's all. The beginning of each game determinates how it will ends. Once you know that you'll win, no matter what your opponent will do, you can do whatever you want. I think it's because you can play only one card per turn: you will be completely unable to defend yourself once your opponent has 4 creatures and you have none. That's really poor game design.\n\nThere is no strategy building, even if there are synergies. Most of the abilities are at least partly random (sometimes you don't know if the ability will be activated, sometimes you don't know which enemy or ally will be targeted, sometimes both). Of course there are some combos but you can't really build something.\n\nThe game is not balanced, but it's not really a problem since the is a big solo "campaign" (at the end of the solo part everyone can have "overpowered" cards, so it is intended that some cards work like powerful bosses and others like weak minions).\n\nIt's a typical TCG with many things you can buy (beginning with boosters), and also much grinding (in this category Nightbanes is one of the TCG where you grind the most).","June 2, 2015","false","2.6"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

Initially, I found the game to be quite engrossing, but later in the game I have found some troubling areas:\n\n1.  It is a grind fest without the content to support it.  The levels go to 50 or 55 -- you will run out of content by 35 and need to constantly regrind the same ai opponents for high levels (many, many ai opponents for each level).  This in itself would not be that bad except some of the key pvp cards are only available to players in the high 40's.  Many of these players seemed to appear in the first three weeks and oddly enough management put in anti-botting software recently.  This would be great except you still have to face those players with the high level cards in pvp.\n\n2.  Seemingly dying player base.  In the English chat room there is normally less than 50 players which means hitting the same people in pvp if you can find a pvp game.\n\n3.  Low content -- the game advertises  a thousand cards.  Looking at the in-game overall reference library, it lists 527 and some of those are not obtainable.\n\n4.  Lack of ethics in selling the product.  They recently instituted a new program where you could get credits for hard to obtain cards based on what you purchased.  There was no before hand advertisement of this change.  I bought a significant number of packs three days before this change.  At the very least I expected a price match.  I have tried to contact the company through their forums and email.  I have not heard back from them.\n\nThis game does look slick and it can be a lot of fun if not downright addicting.

If you want to get a deck which can get you in to 50 top where all the cheaters and big spenders are you have to spend 200$ or more...\n7) You can finis all PvE quest in just 1 week.\n8) There are some PvP Cards that can only be bougth with badges and thay cost up to 2000 badges. 1 PvP win only get 2 badges and PvP losses dont give anything. 2000 Matches to get 1 Card wtf !?!\n9) After 1 week there are just raid bosses and PvP left doing in the game!\n10) New players dont really have a much chance at PvP.\n11) Reward for PvP is very small\n12) Raid bosses can only be done once per week and guild can only kill each boss 100 times. So if other guild members have killed guild boss 100 times before you Lock ín you cant do that boss that week. So only if you Lock in jusr after raid bosses have had there weekly reset will you be able to try to kill them.\n13) No tournements.\n14) Game crashed 2-3 times per day.\n15) 10% of the Cards are over power and 90% of the Cards are under powered. So 90% of the Cards in the game are only usefull the first few hours.\n16) Deck have only 30 Cards and players can have 4 copies of each Card a deck. So many deck only have 12 different Cards in them. So I see the same 20-30 Cards 1000s of time in PvP even thougth this geme have 500 different Cards.\n17) Computer AI just seem to play some random Cards. Cant remember worse AI in a game. AI is only hard because it have been given super skills players cant get.\n18) No story\n19) Manual dont exist\n20) players cant copy and paste in chat.\n21) Not many players play this game so you figth tha same players over and over in PvP. Not funny if a big spender camp at PvP new players will  10 losses i a row.\n22) PvP losses dont give any rewards at all.\n23) Tutoral could be much better. It took me like 2 hours before I got to understand the the game.\n24) Many Cards say that there is a chance that something triggers. The Cards dont tell how often the effect ´triggers.\nIf you spend real Money for at Card with a cool effect just to discover that the effect has 0,01% chance of triggering I feel cheated.\n25) Luck matters a lot in this game.\n26) What Card you owns matter a lot. So spend Money to win.\n27) Deck buildng skill matter Little just fill you deck with you most power Cards. If yopu dont know what Cards are most powerfull justr do some PvP - Rich kid will show you the usefull Cards all the time.\n28) Playing skills matters Little.\n29) The more expensive a Card is the more powerfull it is - So the players who have grinded most or spend most Money have a gigantic advantige.\n30) If you buy boooster from a new set there is often only around 5% chance of gettinga Card you would add to you deck. So if you spend 40$ on booster when a new set is released you only get 1 playable Card. 40$ for one really usefull Card - too expensive.\n31) Tons of grinding\n32)  This game is only for people who are big fan of ccg.\n","April 23, 2015","true","737.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

A friend telling you to try one is the equivalent of a “free” sample from your local dealer. Once you start Nightbanes, you will be asked select one of three basic decks. Undead have massive attack, and represent my favorite style of play. The nature deck has plenty of healing spells and the ability to keep creatures on their feet. Finally, the abomination deck is full of poisons and minions able to slip past the enemy defenses. Gameplay in Nightbanes is extremely quick. The main reason behind this, is the fact that you are only able to play one card per turn. I’ll expand more on that a little later. Once you pick your basic deck, there are plenty of quests to complete. Quests offer a second and third tier which gets progressively harder. To complete the tiers you will need to complete the quests many, many times. There is also a PvP system with some nice card rewards, and you can even form your own vampire clan. Nightbanes is pretty good for a free to play game, but it isn’t without some shortcomings. Let’s put it all out on the table as we look a little deeper at Nightbanes.\n\nIn Nightbanes you play as a vampire lord. Summon the army of your choice and lay the opposing lord to waste. Using only one card per turn is extremely interesting, as you and your opponent will always have a full hand. When a spell or ability is cast, the target is ALWAYS random. This auto-cast, along with the auto-combat that happens as your card is played is an interesting choice that takes some of the strategy out of this strategy card game. Nightbanes still offers a bevy of new mechanics that create some interesting scenarios. Every minion you lay down will fight the minion it is directly facing, bloodlust counters at the top of the card dictate how long it will be until your creature is active. There are also crossed daggers or a shield under the attack/defense indicators that allow certain creeps to equip weapons or armor, if you have them in your deck. Occasionally when opening a pack, you will find a new vampire lord. They all offer different abilities, so collecting the correct one to fit your deck strategy is absolutely vital to your success. Your lord and the enemy lord have a relatively low health total, which makes blitzing an extremely viable strategy. Games are generally very short no matter which strategy you pick though.\n\nPvP is tough, but AI players tend to give an accurate representation of human opponents, especially once you progress into the deeper tiers in the later levels. Only through rigorous testing will you know if your deck will bring you victory, or fold when under pressure. The sheer amount of cards is extremely impressive. In addition, all cards can be upgraded either by combining it with another card or buy spending the specified currency. Obviously upgrades are extremely important, but unless you have an unlimited amount of time it’s impossible to upgrade them all at once. Fortunately, you can break down cards that you have extras of in order to get more currency and expedite the process a little bit. The card art is extremely nice to look at, but could stand to be bigger. Even with items equipped, there seems to be a lot of unused space. The sound effects are decent, but they are recycled relatively often. Music is much the same story as the sound. There really only seems to be one track in the game, and it is rather ambient. While it isn’t distracting, it doesn’t really serve to pull me in either.\n\nI haven’t spoken about the UI. It really seems like a mess to me. Not because it isn’t laid out well, but because not much is explained and orienting yourself to learn the difference between the three types of currency takes an adjustment period. I also won’t hesitate to say that this game has -some- pay to win aspects. Without paying for currency, you will only be able to net a “good” booster pack every 15 days (the basic booster packs can be bought with the grind-able currency). As compensation, you can blitz through a couple quests and unlock a reward of a couple cards. The quest will even tell you what the rewards are, so when combined with upgrades it is possible to build a deck much more reliably than just buying booster packs. While the game lacks a story aside from “vampire clans dueling (back) to the death”, it is extremely replayable with a deceptively deep amount of strategy. Enemies and levels are varied and always keep you wondering what’s next. Most of the quests fought have a theme that becomes more pronounced as you advance, so you can build a deck to counter those flying gargoyles that your undead army can’t seem to hit. This game is certainly worth a shot if you’re looking for a darker, indie version of Hearthstone.

The art is well done and over all theme of monsters and fantasy creatures is captured well enough. The rules are simple enough that someone with little experience in CCG's could easily just pick up and play. Being a Free-to-play game also encourages new players to check it out for themselves. However that also means the "dreaded word" is prolific in this title. That word is Micro-transactions. While all rare cards can be obtained through grinding of the in-game currency. Having a deep wallet cuts this down. Meaning that PvP or other in game features can be easily spoiled. If not ruined.\nIn all Nightbane's strategy is also mitigated by the inability to specifically choose targets. Leaving certain abilities to chance. It isn't that Nightbanes system doesn't work well. Quite the opposite, it's easy to play and matches go quickly. The simple fact is that Nightbanes doesn't really have anything that makes it stand out from the rest. Its standard. Not bad but not great. Bottom line: If you don't mind micro-transactions. Nightbanes is a fair enough choice like any other CCG.\n\nI did a Let's Play/First impressions on this game!

I talked to a guy in the game saying he was a CEO for this game ( he is involved in a game since he gave me 1 blood diamond - game curency you buy for money ). To my question if they plan to make this game less pay to win his answer was that it is not pay to win at all?! So do not expect anything to change when it comes to that.\n\nANYONE telling you this game is not pay to win is either lying or delusional.\n\n2. The game looks ok. Some improvements could be made ( Like the size of the cards in the field and they way you read the text on your cards but it is what it is.  I do love the 2D board. i hate card games that use that 3D board.\n\nWhat I find irritating is the FOG effect and the light effects ( epilepsy simulation game ). I asked if they will ad an option to disable that and the answer was that they have other stiff to work on now. But later on He said that there could be an option to diable the FOG.\nAbout the light effects from the cards his answer was to use sunglasses. ( So much about them taking feedback seriously )\n\n3. The gameplay it self is very, VERY simple. Too simple. I was playing quests just by randomly clicking on minions and I was winning. PvE gets boring really fast.\n\nI tried PvP and it has some good points. The games are really fast, very short amount of time per turn. Also a small detail but the one I liked is that when you concede, it instantly ends the game. Thereis  no slow animation where you have to click a lot to exit that and start a new game. So the games in PvP are really fast.\nBut it seems you lose big or win big. At least at these level not much of a strategy involved.\n\n\n\n4. Also when starting the game you chose from three start packs without knowing nothing about them except some small text. So you have no option to try those decks before chosing one. ( You really should get all starter decks for free )\n\n5. Plus for the game is also that it has chat. Something another card game is missing and tools acctualy defending that.\nYou do not want to look at the chat? Fine, just disable it or you can block individuals. Chat is implemented in a good way.\n\n6. The card art is good. Really good.\n\nSo to sum it all:\n\nCons:\n\n- Pay to win big time\n\n- Light effects on the board and the for ( that is not going to be a problem for some people but I am not a fan of epilepsy effects ),\n\n- Gameplay is just too simple.\n\n- Boring\n\n- Grindy\n\n\nPros:\n\n- I LOVE the 2D board. For card games that looks and works the best. hate the camera angle ( 3D ) board on some other card games. The game to me all in all does look really  good. If only it was not for those irritating visual effects.\n\n- Card art is really good.\n\n- Chat ( sad thing that this has to be a plus, but now even basic stuff is missing from some games )\n\n- PvP is really fast\n\n- No irritating slow animation when you lose and concede works instantly","March 30, 2015","false","3.7"," 75 of 145 people (52%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","52","75","145","5","12"

Closest that comes to mind is Scrolls. Similarly as in Scrolls, position of the card is important, creatures have to wait certain amount of turns to be able to attack, the attacks happen automaticly against the enemy directly ahead.\n\nEvery turn the player has a choice - which of 5 cards to play. This is the only available mechanic, all other effects will happen automaticly (you can't even skip the turn as far as I know). Creature abilities (i.e. "deal 1 fire damage to an enemy") will target at random, your spell effects as well. New players usually complain in the chat about it, but these rules make Nightbanes so different. Not everyone can get accustomed to this kind of play where everything is based on the ability to predict radnomness. It is possible - and a good example is random effect cards in Hearthstone, where they are being played without complains. Playing by randomly clicking on your cards will not lead to victory unless you have an unambiguously better deck. Every game goes very fast and situation changes radically every turn.\n\nAsides from rage (the attack) and health every creature has special abilities (up to 3 per card). Creatures belong to different types - vampiric, corrupted, demonic, abominations, undead etc. - and they deal damage in different ways - phisical, fire, toxic, ballictic etc. Special ability can be defence against specific damage type; cursing an enemy who will get extra damage from specific damage type; dealing extra damage to random enemy; dealing extra damage against specific creature type; disabling a random ability and so on - all possible combinations are very numerous and all are represented in the game.\n\nFor me Nightbanes is mostly a single-player game. Quests are divided in 4 areas. Every area consists of several bosses that player has to play against. For a boss to be counted as defeated, it must be defeated several times in a row, then the next boss will unlock. Defeating all of the bosses will unlock the next area. Boss battles will seem easy in the beginning but they become harder and one might need to select a dedicated deck to defeat a specific boss later.\n\nNightbanes has pay-to-win fame, but I believe this game is most enjoyable without buying strong cards. I enjoy this game without spending anything - I even have not spent any of the available in-game currencies yet. It can be called a grind but to me Nightbanes' bosses create a fealing of accomplishment similar to Dark Souls and Bloodborne - and I reccomend playing this game in this way.\n\nThe game starts with the selection of a starting deck. I chose the first - graveyard - deck and probably it was the best choice because the Undertakers in it are really good in the first area against the undead. This deck is the same that can later be bought in the shop - be careful with that. Nightbanes has several currencies - blood pearls, rubies, diamonds (that can be bought by real money) and badges. Currencies can be used to purchase cards, boosters, decks of different kinds. The player will also gain experience, reputations and PvP or Elo rating - all of it will allow to unlock new cards for purchasing.\n\nDefeating one bosses will unlock stronger cards for defeating harder bosses. Every boss has 3 levels - you only have to defeat level 1 to unlock the next boss. Revard cards will be obtained after defeating level 1 and 2 bosses. Loot cards drop randomly (with 3-5% rate according the people in chat) after every victory over level 2 and 3 bosses. Reaching of a new reputation level unlocks new cards for purchase and usually gives you one of that card type. Joining a guild is mandatory for defeating raid bosses and getting loot from them. Nightbanes also feature card crafting from other cards and leveling-up certain cards (to 3 levels).\n\nThe flaws\nI hugely enjoy Nightbanes as single-player experience, but in the end I will mention three biggest flaws of this game:\n\n1) Interface is lacking. Nightbanes doesn't have tooltips and overall clearness in displaying player's data. Players with weaker computers complain that the game tanks in quest screens because of particle systems in them. Game screen really lacks card log, without it unexperienced players will have a hard time to understand why their strong creature sometimes is killed in one turn.\n\n2) Pay-to-win aspect. Definately Nightbanes has pay-to-win in it. The game features huge amount of cards that in PvP will overwhelm any player with weaker deck. Maybe that could be solved by sorting players in PvP categories in better way. Current situation most likely is off-putting for new players.\n\n3) The game has no lore. I guess it is just assumed that vampires fight werewolves because - what else would they do? Quest areas have short descriptions, but single bosses don't - they only have their names. The cards usually have descriptions that are uninspired, often with attempts of humour (I suspect that Nightbanes is made by Germans - and I believe Germans themselves will admit that they and humour don't go well together). Creatures don't have consistancy - Nightbanes feature minions with shotguns together with skeletons with round shields and swords. Sometimes the game throws somethind completely unappropriate - like Spartan warriors. Art of Nightbanes - made in modern moody, though rushed CG tablet style - is inspired by everything from the World of Darkness to the movie 300 (right - Spartans).\n\nI like to call Nightbanes the Dark Souls of card games and I enjoy it and suggest everyone at least to try it out.","April 17, 2015","true","48.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Very simple.\nHowever, the gamemakers is actually very generous and letting you get free cards doing quests, PVP etc..\nSo you can basicly grind all your cards, more or less. If you have the patience for it.\nI play alot of free games, and if i like the game, i dont mind buying some of there stuff.\nJust remember out there. All free games do need to have some kind of income to keep having the game open for you.\nMy review on this game is top dollar. super many quests to make your cards, to earn points to buy cards, guild option with more quests and ofc, PVP.

PVP CAN be fun, you can play against live players or computers controlling random players' decks, but usually you will come across people that have fed their wallet to the game. They all have similar decks and use the same strategies. The pay to win aspects have only gotten worse as time goes on. There are a large number of reward cards for various things such as PVP combat, leveling up, etc...but as of recently they now cost the premium currency even after you've unlocked them.

Look at Solforge, it is a lane vs lane game but the longer matches go on the more your cards change which creates an interesting dilemma, do you use cards which are rubbish early but godly late, or do you try to rush your foe down? As well as the usual options such as stalling or health burn and so on and so forth.\n\nNightbanes is also a lane vs lane game but unlike Solforge this game uses a weird system to determine what lane what creature occupies, instead being a first come first serve system...I think.\nYou see I am not sure. Okay I am in this case but overall my review of Nightbanes might as well be 'I think this is how things work, but I'm not sure'.\n\nI played through the tutorial and I figured after a few games the holes would be filled. So I called up a friend and we played a few rounds before they-- the game crashed on them. I will mark that as a unity issue but who knows? Their was no crash log for us to check and the game technically didn't crash to desktop either it just, hung.\n\nWe played free PvP and wow as a beginner you better be able to read fast! You have 15 seconds, no you can't set it even during friendly matches, to play your action. We are new to this game so we want to read the cards and maybe get a grasp on all the complex systems going on, but no.\n\nJust choose a card and pray to buddha.\n\nSo, much confusion later I wandered back into the fray, solo this time. Now I can read my cards in detail and urm...\nWhats this? Whats that? Whats everything? No in game information whatsoever and this game is not a magic the gathering clone, I can guess what things do but is that really how a card game should be? Can you imagine Yugioh with only 15 seconds to read each card effect? Or throwing cards out whilst guessing the effect?\n\nI wouldn't say the game is poorly designed, it does enough to not be classed as a bad game and would probabaly be a great game if it took more time to explain things to the player, or maybe it does in 1 player mode. Because I buy card games to play against no one else, obviously.\n\nBut I decided that I was just not going to get far into this game and my time would be better spent looking around. The game features grind and while it has a cash shop the amount you would have to spend is mind bogglingy high. I do not exaggerate when I say it is probably equal in cost to buying every single Yugioh card printed to date.\nYou see the game has a 'cool' feature where you can combine 2 cards and create a brand new card ala crafting! And once again instead of making this something cool you can do in combat, instead it is hidden behind a paywall for no good reason except to slow down your rate of enjoyment.\n\nNow I said 'paywall'; the game features 4 types of currency when I last checked. Of course it has gems because all cash games just call them gems now and you buy those with money and they convert into some other currencies. Then you have the worthless currency which these types of games like to dole out. Then you have a PvE currency for completing 1 player activities. Then you have PvP currency which is self explanitory and honestly there might be even more currencies after that which I just didn't see.\n\nI like Nightbanes and I feel like it had some talented people working on it but I also feel like executive meddling just ruined enough things about the game to make it crippled in the face of its competition. I insulted Solforge in my review of it but it is honestly the better free card game and both Nightbanes and Solforge are completely crippled in the face of Magic the Gathering (online) which is also free to play so when you face such stiff competition as that I do not understand why you go through pains to alienate new players.\n\nCash shops are all well and good but I could be King Kong on top of the empire state building but if nobody is around and the city is abandoned then all the money I spent is worthless because I have no one to hoard it over and be an elitist prick too and the few times I did play this game the lobbies were quiet, never exceeding 10 players concurrently.\nThe grind is real so players who have spent money on the game will have a huge advantage and will throttle the game by demotivating newbies which is made worse by the fact the game does have an ELO rating system but that isn't effected by the quality of the cards you have so you can spend lots of money and roflstomp newbs quite easily.\nAll ten of them.","April 1, 2015","false","213.7"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","10","19","0","0"

Giving free player hard chance to win and take extreme long hours to get better even with evolution or cards and  upgrading (upgrade cost high too) making most of the game play farming one place for a very long time. [0 star / 3 Star {-1 star for extreme high farming time, -1 star for extreme high cost at low level, P2Win system too obvious - 1 Star}]\n\nHaving guild and guild events interesting concept, but the quest has no special function for example leveling up a guild, etc. as good as just forming a random team [just that a guild makes it looks like constant players]. Can be better. More function can be added to Increase needs for being in a guild. [ 1 Star / 2 Star {- 1 star for being badly useful to have this mode other than gather a grp of people}]\n\nPVP: Having PVP for people to challage each other (1 point) but terrible system with bad settings. Due to there is no point limits per card and deck, P2Win deck will always be at the top rank. Not friendly to new players and ELO system not good enough.

Its an ok game to play. But the way its desighned is like you need to be willing to spend alot of money, or waste your time grinding to open 1 type of pack with 4 cards in it. Play the game for 4 hours and its will start to seem pointless. Grind about 4 matches to get 1 pack. That gets old fast. And when your not grinding. The entire fate of the battle depends on what cards show up in your hand as well as the enemys. you can fight the same guy 10 times. 3 might go flawlessly but the rest might kick your teeth in. The current theme of the game is that the enemy A.I. has more hp then you. And it loves to heal its units. But alot of the units in the forest for example. They have 6 hp 3at. and they get healed by 2hp.  Plus a healing monser and monsters with backlash. You just waste time and hope your cards line up right. And thats then entire game basicly. Just grind and hope your cards come perfectly. Cuz once your flanked or over powered. Your basicly screwed. 7 life points drops pretty quick when the A.I. isnt getting whipped. Another flaw is the magic cards. they attack at random. Just like the abilitys. If you could choose who gets attacked or who get an attack boost then this game wouldnt be as bad.

It is a very cool small community at the moment and a great time consumer.","April 21, 2015","true","580.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

The art is fantastic and many cards have wonderful Illustrations that fit very well with what Nightbanes is all about. The story line isn't very clear, some cards and majority of the gameplay has chunks of the plot.\n\nI've logged in a weeks worth of game time and within that time, I've enjoyed everything that this game has to offer.

None of them intrigues me as much as Nightbane does. This game is fast paced and rewarding.\n\nI can see my progress everyday in leveling and collecting cards. The PVP reward is not too hard to get if you really invest some time to think and learn from you rivals. Some of very good cards are from quests and PvP rewards, and buying cards with real money does not guarantee you win in the battle.\n\nAfter level 20, you will find much easier to farm in- game currency which can be used to purchase packs. If you farm quickly enough, you wont need real money to get the full deck.\n\nPeople always jump to conclusion and say that one game is pay to win after they play for  2 hours. You need   more time and more brain  to find Nightbanes can be free to play game.\n\nI personaly bought some packs with real money because I really like the graphics of some cards. And I got beaten often by free  players, cause they have better skills and better cards from higher level.  I am grinding hard to level to unlock those cards.\n\nActually the Dev responds quickly after players give the inputs. I told one of their community staff in game that we need guild chat, and they made it happen in two days. They do listen to players.\n\nIf you like this game, join our guild. We wont kick people for no reason.","April 16, 2015","true","616.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The missions of the game or so called quests you do in the game to earn cards etc were pretty easy my first time going through i just wrecked everything and i dont know if it was the starter deck i chose or just the game but i hope that is checked out.

The card art isn't the prettiest as well. Aside from all the disgusting stuff like maggots, zombies and insects, you only have one or two pretty vampire-ladies and a couple of human ones.

A card game has always been pay to acquire cards and I think anyone who feels the necessity to point out what people should already know is not only redundant but reflected poorly on the reviewer.\n\nHaving said all of that, the game is very fast paced and maybe not as high as a skill cap of MTG it is certainly quite fun and makes up for in the playstyle difference.\n\nComplaining about grinding is ignorant, it is a card game.  You play to improve and learn new things, the skill ceiling again isn't as high as other card games but it is certainly not a free win without some thought put into your card choice.\n\nHowever, unlike most card games.  This one is a lot less pay to win than your average one, I also never see any mention but a new account awards you with 100 Blood Diamonds which equals out to roughly 6 dollars.  They also issue a one-time purchase starter pack for 10 dollars that gives you 300 Blood Diamonds.  I've enjoyed playing it so far and at least 75% of us in the top PvP leaderboards currently haven't put much money past the 10 dollar starter pack.  It's a good value and it supports the developers.\n\nIn closing, if you are a person not familiar with the concept of money and trading card games, then you should stay away.  If you understand them and know that how little pay to win this game is in comparison to a game like MTG (Where a single card can reach a ridiculous value ie. Black Lotus, Jace, all Power 9, etc.) then I definitely say download it and give it a shot.  It's pretty neat and an excellent playstyle difference which makes it quite a bit fun.\n\nIt also includes a campaign mode vs the AI and weekly raids which offer a varying difference of playstyle and reach out to the casual community, which is something you will not find in another TCG.","April 4, 2015","true","459.8"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","11","25","0","0"

Having played many card games in the past, most were pretty good and had high ratings, but I decided to try this one anyway.\n\nIt certainly does not deserve the crap votes it's been getting.\n\nThe game is very similar to most card games, however with a unique twist. As far as I can tell it's focused more on a "realism" factor than most. Due to its similiarities I won't describe what it has in common with other CCG games, but what is exactly different.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\n- You have your "Hero" card or who you're playing as. The cards HP, and abilities are "you", and this is what you try to destroy (the opponents) with the rest of the cards in your deck. This is similar to some CCG's, but I thought I'd throw that out there as not all CCG games have this.\n\n- Mount Cards: Mount Cards are cards you can draw to equip your hero card with. The mount card has to be destroyed first, before you can damage the hero card.\n\n- Locations: Location cards are "locations" your army is on. These have additional effects every turn. Only 1 location card can be out at a time.\n\n- Equipment Cards: Equipment cards have a unique twist. When the creature that's holding them dies it goes into your discard pile, (like all CCG's), however, if a creature in play is able to hold an equipment card, but doesn't have one, every turn it has a chance to pick up a dropped weapon.\n\n- Artifacts: Artifact cards are Cards with their own HP on the table, you need to lower their own unique HP pool to destroy them and remove them from play.\n\nAs I said earlier, it's based more on "realism" in a fun way, with how artifacts, equipment being able to be picked up, and locatios of the battle for your armies, adds a cool little twist.\n\nThe art work is very well done, and really gives a dark forboding feel without also feeling corny or cartoonish. You get a sense of dark varmpirism, undead, and tainted creatures that otherwise woud be holy (like dark fairies), that creates a rather unique atmosphere.","May 6, 2015","true","1.1"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

It's grindy CCG and money spenders can get more copies of some cards that are strong in the current PvP meta.\n\npros and cons:\n+ Game is fast paced. If you know what you are doing, match can take 10-20 seconds to finish.\n+ Grinding works towards multiple goals at the same time (experience, reputation, quest progress and rewards, free currency, loot)\n+ Constant updates. Devs release patches weekly and expansions often. Browser version of this game is far ahead in content so there is plenty of it stored for steam version.\n+ Regular boosters have chance to contain premium cards that are for $ otherwise.\n+ Community is pretty relaxed and helpful. New players ask in chat often and experienced players give them hints and answers every time.\n\n- Heavy grind. It took me about 350 hours to farm about 98% of currently farmable content (including base set rares) and that's without future expansions.\n- As of now the population is bit low, which affects PvP matchmaking (low ELO can mee high ELO). This means that getting reasonable match is possible only during peak hours.\n- Game is somewhat luck based. You don't target anything. Targetting is handled by random algorythm or is automatic (i.e. equipment goes to leftmost creature). Although risk assesment over precise tactics might appeal to some people.\n- f2p players get only 1 copy of level up reward. More have to be bought for diamonds ($ currency) with no way around it.\n- f2p players have quite limited booster income. They will get relevant $ cards/epics only with a lot of luck or even more patience.\n\nOne thing I noticed after playing through most of the content:\nThe general game strategy actually changes. You will find out that the advanced PvE content and raids is a lot about preparation (deckbuilding) since bosses are suddenly very powerful and ordinary deck usually won't cut it. You need to find specific strategy that works against certain boss.\nPvP on the other hand can get almost chess like (if players are equally matched), where you need to think about creature placement, activation times and how everything shifts in turn or two. I had a few really long games where me and my oppnets drew all the cards after 24 turns and player with better tactical plcement won. Unfortunately player who spends $ and knows what he is doing, will get upper hand in PvP. He can still lose given that game is based on some randomization or if he doesn't know what he is doing with his premium cards. But if players are equal in skill, the paying player will obviously have better chances.\n\nFor those interested in currency system.\nPearls. Used for leveling cards, evolving cards, buying faction and ELO rewards. Also buying Base set Light booster. (3 common, 1 uncommon/chance (roughly 5%) for a rare). You get them from every PvE game without any limitation.\nRubies. Only used for regular boosters (these boosters contain 3 common, 2 uncommon and 1 rare with a chance of epic or premium card associated with the set). 15 rubies per booster. Obtained by daily log in (15/week), raiding (35/week) and by finishing last stage of quests (~200 in total-one time reward).\nDiamonds. You start with 100. Rest can only be bought for real money (best deal is about 30 diamonds/1$). Prices of individual premium cards generally range from 20-100 diamonds (~1-3$/card). Boosters cost 30 diamonds(1$).\nPvP badges. Active ranked pvp win earns +3. Passive unranked pvp (AI controls decks of other players) earns +1. Your passive deck winning over someone in passive pvp earns +1 badge. Prices for individual cards range from 25 to 2000. ELO rewards of current season will be made available for badges later (after 2 seasons in browser version. Steam is still in Season 1.)\nNewly introduced epic tokens. Buying regular booster for rubies or diamonds earns 1 epic token. You can spend those on epic cards (newest set epics not available until another set is released). Pricing is 30 for non-unique, 60 for unique and 100 for strongest cards (so far only 1 cards is worth 100). So if you have no luck getting an epic from boosters, you can still get it this way.\nWith all that said, I must say I enjoy playing this game a lot. It doesn't force me to pvp like some other card games. PvE content is reasonably big although grinding stretches it somewhat.\nUnfortunately, PvP is not in the greatest shape atm especially with low population count.\n\nIs this game for you? It might be. I would say give it a try and see for yourself.","May 20, 2015","true","585.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It has this dark fantasy setting, with some excellent artwork and overall look. I was amazed my (otherwise very slow) internect connection and PC would allow for this!\nAnd while I don't usually play PC card games and gave up on browser games forever ago, I continue to return to Nightbanes. Not because the gameplay is that good, but because I like collecting those cards.\n\nMost of the complaints you will read in the negative reviews are true, PVP doesn't make sense unless you pay a lot of money for actually good cards and without money the game can be very frustrating at times. The single player mode seems to artifically lenghten the game by making you beat the same enemy up to 50 times before you will be rewarded. While a lot of the game seems to center around forcing the player to buy in-game items, the card battles themselves are still fairly interesting. From what I've seen so far, the NPC enemies all differ from each in tactics and can require you to adapt your deck. I think that especially during the first "map", the graveyard, you will find that the game is not too badly balanced.\n\nAs already mentioned, I very much like the game for the art design and while I technically don't support micro-transaction bull... you know what I mean - I actually did put a few bucks into the game. Because I still have hope, that with enough success (and money) one day the game does not need to depend on a micro-transaction system anymore and can be much more fun. Every company starts out small and I try to respect that.\n\nI say; Give the game a try and if you like it - in any way - consider any money put into it not as a rip-off, but an investment. And you can take that from someone who has quit a number of MMOs and the like for their unfair paying-systems and un-original ideas.\n\n\nEdit: I do need to say another negative thing about the game, though: Why can't I use my browser login on the desktop client? I see that the desktop-version is not all up to date (which is worrying enough) but I don't feel like starting over again!","May 23, 2015","true","0.1"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

If you dont, you become fodder for the top players in PVP, but you can still grind your way into the PVE content just fine.\n\nJust be aware that has the game releases more expansions, you have to keep paying to stay on top, otherwise people who has paid to get the new evolutions will have an edge over you (the lizard commandos will make your valuable undead rogues quickly obsolete). But maybe the original epics you got with your initial investment will be enough to carry you through.\n\nYou can get new evolutions without paying, but it is incredible slow, and most of the basic cards are basically worhtless in PVP. A common or uncommon will get you nowhere and has to be replaced as soon as possible.\n\nLeveling cards with the pearls you have grinded help, but not as much as an evolved card with several rares. And the only way to really get several copies of the same rare from the new expansion is paying up. Otherwise it might take you months to get there. During that time, you will be pummeled by the people who paid.\n\nAlso, additional copies of certain cards, like rogue undead or bone berserker, cost real money. No other way to get them. Incidentally, rogue undead and bone berserker are the most used cards in PVP, among others that you can only get with money. With extremely small decks of 30 cards, just having 3 copies of a certain key card instead of 1 makes all the difference. And of course, power cards are even more valuable, since these show up more often that they would in a 60 card sized deck\n\nIs this model pay to win? I dont know.

This is pretty much it: there is no dialogue whatsoever, and the PvE mode, which consists of "quests", features four "campaigns" in which you fight seven/eight opponents multiple times until you unlock the boss. After you defeat him, a new campaign unlocks. I'm not going to count the story, since it's basically non existent.\n\nGRAPHICSIf you are a fan of Heartstone, prepare to be disappointed, because even though the game is developed using Unity there are little to no animations: you'll only see cards moving, maybe a fireball or two, but nothing more.\n\nGAMEPLAYThe gameplay is quite different from Heartstone, and not necessarily in a good way: at the beginning of each fight, both sides are given five cards. You can put down only one card per round, which will go left. The Monster cards have blood points: a blood point is earned at the end of each round, and when the monster has all the points unlocked, he will attack the enemy in front of him at the end of each round. If there is no enemy, the monster will attack the opposite vampire lord, and the round is won if he gets killed before yours is. While this might sound interesting, the game gets really boring really fast. Most of the times (especially in the beginning), you can beat a round by using random cards. Success doesn't really depend on strategy, but by how lucky you are on getting more Monster cards rather than Ability cards or Upgrade cards. As with most games, playing against a human player is more challenging, especially if they know how to properly play the game.\nThis is for cards what Borderlands is for guns: there are over 500 cards to buy or unlock, each with different perks. This is a simple enough reason for buying this game if you are into cards.\n\nCHALLENGEAs I've already said, the game is fairly easy to master, and most of the times you will be defeated because you didn't have enough monster cards rather than having an actual strategy.\n\nSOUNDThere is an endless loop of repetitive and extremely quiet music that plays in the background, both when fighting and when exploring the menus. The game also lacks in sound effects for the cards, with little variety. I found myself muting the entire game and putting more engaging songs in the background, and that really helped making the fights more interesting.\n\nREPLAYABILITYAfter a quest is completed, you can beat it again in two harder modes to unlock better cards. Other than that, there is PvP. There are also a total of 29 Steam achievements. So, there is not much to do.\n\nIn the end, only fans of card games will enjoy this game. To most gamers this will be a more boring and tedious experience, rather than an enjoyable game.\n\nStory: n/a\nGraphics: 5\nGameplay: 5\nChallenge: 4\nSound: 3.5\nReplayability: 5\n\nENJOYMENT: 5\nFRUSTRATION: 6\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","March 30, 2015","false","1.7"," 50 of 123 people (41%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","41","50","123","13","7"
