"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SunsetAmethyst/recommended/230230/","SunsetAmethyst","SunsetAmethyst","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SunsetAmethyst/","1085 products in account","The short version:\nDivinity: Original Sin aims to be a modern day Ultima 7 and is reminiscent of many of the older games in the genre, it will make many of you who did like games such as Baldurs Gate II and Planescape Torment very happy indeed, especially if you also like turn based tactical combat. Players will be able to create a team, make choices and see how the consequences of their actions bear out.\n\nThe long version:\nThis is a game with little to no hand holding and it does not insult your intelligence by making this game accessible to your five year old sister, no this game is a deep tactical turn-based RPG experience.  Not only will you have freedom over your choices in the story (consequences and choices, even disagreements, will affect how things go), but also in how you get there.\n\nYou will be forced to interact with the world and speak to the people in it to gain information and quests, this is especially true as there are no exclamation marks over their heads telling you that this person is important or that they have information you need. It's also a game that rewards exploration, should you be careless enough you could find yourself completely missing out on certain quests. You can even kill most npc's in the game should you wish to do so (with the exception of a very few plot specific ones), but be careful of what you decide to do, there will be consequences for your actions.\n\nThere will be puzzles, lots of traps and mysteries to solve and interesting ways to approach many of the quests, you have the freedom to go wherever you want and the areas/monsters -wont- scale to your level, meaning you could die a very horrible death by exploring too far when you are low level. You could also be very skillful with the items/weapons at hand and somehow actually kill that level four troll while you are just a meager level two knight.\n\nBeing a rogue is especially fun as you can steal nearly everything, including snatching paintings off the walls, pick pocketing their weapons or even keys to their homes for a later "visit". Stealth is also very viable when stealing, but be careful, if you are caught people will dislike you and that will affect prices and information you can get, eventually you will be thrown into jail. Once there your partner can either come and bust you out or... well.. i wont spoil the surprise for you, suffice to say that there are more ways than one to get out of jail.\n\nParty-based turn-based combat will encourage players to shape and control the game's environments, and to discover and utilize various skill and spell combos that you can choose for your party members\n\nBut the best part is the superb co-op experience, gone are the days when only player 1 gets to decide upon important decisions. You can both talk to any and all npcs and you both take part in dialogues during important events or with certain npcs, and should you two disagree on how to resolve a quest or dialogue you can have your characters argue over it. They will also react to certain things, for example, if you steal something your partner can start up a dialogue with you to either condone your actions or condemn them.\n\nAs to not spoil anything in the game this example is merely fiction and not present in the game. (Not to my knowledge at least)\n\nexample: You find a valuable gem on the beach and player 1 wants to sell it while player 2 wants to try and find the owner of it, stating that its immoral to take such a valuable object from someone who obviously dropped it.\n\nPlayer one then gets a few different dialogue options to try and talk some sense into the other player's character, he can choose between a string of diffrent types of retorts and some might be intimidate, persuade, charm etc. After he has chosen his retort player two can choose a counter argument and will utilize the skill you chose and a game of rock, paper, scissors will commence, you will utilize the skillpoints in that particular skill you choose to gain an advantage over your friend in this game.\n\nDepending on the outcome it will either be in favor of your decision or not, this will also give you points in various personality traits such as romantic or pragmatic depending on what you choose to say and these points will net you bonuses to your personality and other skills. Also it can be quite possible to make the two characters hate/love each other in the end.\n\nThis went on far longer than i intended so i will end this here by saying that the game is great and hopefully it will stay as amazing as it is now throughout the whole game (currently playing through it). Also, im Swedish so my english and grammar is not perfect, apologies for that.","June 30, 2014","true","202.9"," 3,338 of 3,482 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","338","3","0","99"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigdenim/recommended/230230/","bigdenim","Big Denim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigdenim/","244 products in account","In a gaming world full of handholding, uninspired battle systems, and just sheer crap, Divinity is a shining diamond in the rough.\n\nGraphics - 9/10:\nLoot-based, dungeon-crawling RPGs are never known for their graphics so I will rate it on a level equivalent to similar games like Torchlight 2 and Diablo 3.  I'm going to put this simply - Divinity is ****ing gorgeous.  The art direction is spot on, the colors are bright and bring the world to life, and the character designs are great too.  You won't feel like you're trudging through the same damn dungeon or cave for the 50th time in a row.  Everywhere feels unique.  You'll traverse vast forests of green, blistering cold mountain tops, firey fields of skeletons and so much more.  It's a well-imagined world that makes the game worth of a 9/10 score in the graphics department.\n\nSound - 8/10:\nSo don't expect full voice overs or anything like that.  There will be spoken dialogue from time to time- particularly from your main characters, but for the most part NPCs' dialogue is all written (but very well written mind you).  So why am I giving it an 8 for sound?  Because the music is some of the best I've heard in a video game...EVER!\n\nStory - 8/10:\nYou're a Source Hunter (yeah I know...just another cliche name for a hero that's received his title and known for aboloshing evil magic and foes from the land).  But don't let that make you overlook what's an otherwise pretty good story as far as loot-based RPGs go.  You start out by coming to town to solve a murder.  I think this mystery-style beginning really helps drive the games gameplay.  Divinity: OS expects you to listen to NPCs, pick up on subtle hints found in text and side character dialogue, and really just discover, discover, discover to unravel the story and new missions.\n\nIt's worth noting that some may as a result get really frustrated by this lack of handholding; I on the other hand think it's great and really helps add to the game's charm.\n\nGameplay - 11/10:\nThis is where the game shines.  All aspects of this game are fun.  As stated earlier, the clue-finding and unravelling of the story are fun.  You'll be posed with hints, clues, and puzzles which will lead to scratching your head, yet always persistant on unlocking the next series of quests.\n\nBeyond this, the interactions amongst your party's characters and NPCs is fun.  Divinity includes a rock-paper-scissors style mini-game to determine the outcome of conversations.  I know it sounds weird, but it's actually really fun.  If an NPC is not particularly interested in giving up information to you, then you can try to beat him at a game of RPS.\n\nWhere this game truly shines though is in the battle system.  Everything is action point and turn-based driven.  Depending on speed and initiative, an order to character turns will be determined at the beginning of the fight (similar to FFX).  Character's can obviously use special skills and spells to influence their turn postions.  You also have action points for each turn which again is stat-driven based on a characters constitution among other things.  Obviously different skills and spells take different amount of points to cast depending on their power and your overall skill level.\n\nSo far I'm sure this sounds like a pretty standard turn-based battle system.  BUT WAIT - THERE's MORE.  Truly the best part about Divinity is the unique use of elemental environments.  Characters can cast spells, blow up barrles, and manipulate the environment in all sorts of ways to overcome foes.\n\nGroup of enemies standing in a puddle of water?  Shoot an electric bolt to make them all stunned for 3 turns.  No puddle of water?  No problem- cast a rain spell first across the battlefield to create your own puddles then shock it.\n\nOf course that's a simplistic approach that you'll learn how to do in the first 10 minutes of the game.  I won't mention the other awesome environmental elements you can manipulate 'cause I think Divinity is one of those games where part or if its spirit is the unknown.  There's A LOT to learn in this game.  There is, for instance, both crafting and blacksmithing skills in the game, that is so deep and complex, that after 40 hours of playing, I haven't even begun to scratch the surface yet.\n\nOverall 10/10:  It's one of the best RPGs I've ever played - hands down.  You're really not doing yourself any favors by passing on this game.  In fact, I'd call you a fool if you did.  This game should be played by every and any person that considers themselves a gamer.","November 1, 2014","true","36.4"," 809 of 878 people (92%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","92","809","878","18","12"

If the bugs that are currently in the game can be worked out before release, then I'd heartily recommend it to anyone who's a fan of RPG's.\n\nThe game has some interesting ideas, and from what I've seen so far I think the experience can only be enhanced by playing it in the two player cooperative mode that will be available on release.\n\nThe turn based combat is fun, beyond the generic "villager" conversations that crop up everywhere, the dialog is interesting, and little puzzles keep you from facerolling your way through without putting any thought into what you're doing.\n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand, but if you're into RPG's, your so interested in seeing what the next person is doing, or how to solve the next puzzle that you wouldn't want it to anyway.","January 17, 2014","true","94.7"," 755 of 863 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","755","863","0","20"

You can play the wohle game with drop in/drop out co-op with some friend/random guy. You can have a total of 8 Characters (2 starting chars, 2 henchman and 1 summon each). There are currently 4 companions (full story) and 42 Henchmens (hireable for gold). More will be released for free.\n\nOn game start you create 2 Chars. You can fully customize em, like gender, class, perks, skills, stat points etc. There are no restrictions and you can actualy make some crazy characters.\n\nFighter with earth magic who uses 2 hand weapons, crossbow and tanking skills? check.\n\nRogue with teleport powers, haste, backstab and charming skills? check.\n\nWitch that curses, throws fireballs, heals your party while beeing guarded by a huge lighting elemental? check\n\nRanger with cooking skill, sneaking, able to talk to animals and trading + crafting skills? check\n\nThe visuals Spell SFX are realy amazing. And bloody hell, this game is challenging! No, there isnt any crap like flys or rats to kill. An undead knight is actualy as strong as your own fighter char. If you make one wrong descision or move, youre dead....thats simply it :D.\n\nFor example, if you fight an undead army (3 fighters, 1 mage, 2 archer for example) and just one undead fighter gets near your mage, he will kill your mage in 2-3 hits :).\n\ni recommend playing the game in co-op with 2 chars that have the lone wolf perk. This way, its basicaly 2 vs the rest of the world, while each player has a realy strong and epic char due to the lone wolf stat bonuses. Lone Wolf makes the character unable to hire an companion but he gets huge bonuses (like 70% more life, more AP) but you can still summon. So in the end you can have the 2 chars + 2 summons if you play with lone wolf perk.\n\nCombat in this game is turn based. All actions use action points, the faster (dextery + speed stats) your char is, the more AP you get. There is a huge range of skills + spells and not 2 of em are the same. Each spell is unique and you need to decide round for round what skills youre going to use...there is no "press X to win" ;)\n\nAlso, the soundtrack used in this game is realy epic...its kinda like skyrim one, with drums and chanting womans and stuff. i just think 130 different soundtracks are a bit to much, but hey...more is allways better, right?\n\nNow to the bad points:\n\ni dont recommend the game at all to casual players. Its like the ultimate anti casual game, because if you just run around, clicking through npc dialoge and run like a chicken into the next fight, you will end up dead, with no way of winning. There is alot of lore around in the game and if you just skip through it all, you will have no clue what the heck is going on around you.\n\nAll loot is random, which can lead to some crazy playthoughs. Its perfectly possible to have allmost no chance of winning anymore, because you only found crap or you used all items. Even the merchants have random stuff. On the other side, its also the reason why the game has a huge replayability. You never know what you find around the next corner. The game also has a realy complex crafting system, from cooking to crafting new sword, there is something for everyone.\n\nEdit: Having now played 60+ hours, this game is my new all time favorite RPG. By reading the forum, i found out that, i have finished around 1/3 of the game. Crazy!  :)\n\nOverall, i give Divinity Original Sin a 9 out of 10.\n\nIf you have any questions just add me in Steam :)","June 27, 2014","true","93.1"," 733 of 839 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","733","839","0","18"

While i wouldn't consider myself new to this type of games, i was soon reminded of how hard RPGs can be.\n\nFor people that are new to the genre, this game can prove to be quite frightening, especially at the beginning, even in normal difficulty. The lack of direction given, or... the freedom of choice you have... makes the game quite confusing at first, which is why its highly recommended to always read the dialogue carefully. The game even gives you the option to read again the whole conversation through the conversation log tab.\n\nCo-op mode adds to the fun of the game. The fact that you can play the entire game along with a friend makes it the more enjoyable to go through. While people can argue that co-op can make any game look better, Divinity: Original Sin, gives a further meaning to play with your friend, having the NPCs actually acknowledging your companion and not just simply having it there for the sake of having someone around. You can get to talk with your allies at any time, getting to know them more. At certain times, depending on your actions, you will even get short interactions with whoever is in your party that can boost certain traits based on the answer given. There is a meaning for your friend to be there, is not like other games where your co-op companion is just another clone of yourself.\n\nThe gameplay is fun. Turn-base combat system based on AP (Action points) is self explanatory, the more AP's you have, the more actions you can make in your turn. Each character has its own APs that are boosted by their attributes and gear.\n\nYou are given several classes to pick from though you are not prohibit from learning other classes abiilties. For example, my knight can use water-based skills which are the ones that can grant healing spells along with other water/ice abilities. As for character appearance customization, its not really deep, in fact, i believe it might be one weak point of the game.\n\nOverall, the game is incredibly addicting and fun. While the early levels might discourage newcomers, this game sure is one big reminder that classic-style RPGs are not dead and can show up at any time to surprise us and remind just how fun and frustrating they used to be. I was lucky enough to encounter no bugs so far, which is something i am grateful for seeing how i read some bugs around that can make progress quite more painful than what it should.\n\nI would hate myself if i had to give a real numeric value to the game, so i will say this: "If you are curious about the game, buy it, you will simply not regret it"\n\nOne last thing, save often. F5 will be one of your strongest allies. (Not kidding, really, save often)","October 26, 2014","true","80.1"," 690 of 803 people (86%) found this review helpful 153 people found this review funny","86","690","803","153","3"

Will try to update once release has arrived. Most of the problems have been solved now so it can only be better then this review :P\n\nCertainly an unexpected arrival of triple A quality\n\nTopview action-rpg with turnbased combat, the graphics are nicer then most topview games though ofcourse not that near to next-gen quality ;D\n\nThe movement is smooth, it reacts nicely to mouseclicks and the pathing seems to work very well mostly (at waypoints it still tends to stand behind the portal instead of in front). The dialogue is nice and allows for alot of changes in the world that actually really affact you (even in this early stage.. ive almost tried murdering everything/everyone once to see what would happen XD)\n\nSometimes there are a bit to much choices (like 10 or more) but thats rare and doesnt bother to much as you dont need to talk to everyone anyway.\n\nThe combat is nice. Atm some spells might need a better visual effect showing what area it will do damage in and ofcourse alot of the spells and stats are still missing. Nonetheless the combat system works quite well and it feels really good. The turnbased system is one that ive not been used to in a while but its almost like second nature anyway. At higher level mobs and bosses it can get quite tricky and will require tactics.\nLuckily enviromental stuff works great .. some things arent in yet but making people slide and fall with ice, guiding electric dmg with water, burning oil etc. you spill out of barrel or lighting poisonous gasses is funny as hell.\n\nAside from that.. exploration and gazing. I kept looking around at all the wonderous things at the side of the road and i hated every sign/roadsplit for making me have to choose.. i wanted to see everything XD\nThe itemsystem is compact and simple (atm sorting inventorydoesnt really work well). This means you have a nice amount of combinations you can do.. you can combine nails with wood or a stick to make a spiked mace, buckets to make bucket helmets etc. etc. I myself havent fully gone into this but accoding to Larian there will be a massive amount of funny combinations.\n\nThe one thing i really feel lacking atm is character customisation. Which includes customising character at creation, amount of skills available atm and amount of character-relationship stats. However as these are a big part of the game, they will come.\n\nThe graphics are nice. At first i thought it was slightly bloomy but after a while you realise it just fully fits the game and it just looks great. The performance.. depends. On low-end PCs it runs amazing mostly, at high-end PCs it still runs well, but not as good as expected and people with SLI sometimes have problems with it.\n\nThats about it.\n\nDo realise... this is alpha","January 17, 2014","true","44.9"," 417 of 525 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","417","525","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jaangor/recommended/230230/","jaangor","Johnny Ravioli","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jaangor/","188 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is so good I can't even write a joke-y review about it.\n\nEven though it is in early release, it is still one of the most fun games I have played this year. It draws heavy inspiration from older games such as Baldur's Gate and Planescape:Torment , and with its beautiful graphics, the isometric gameplay makes myself (as a fan of those games) feel right at home.\n\nWhat makes Original Sin so good, is that it fills a gap that has been missing in the past couple of years. Character driven RPGs that don't hold the players hand through the whole ordeal are far and few between. The isometric view gives combat a strategic feel, and gives life to the world as your character interacts with the environments around it.\n\nThe combat is challenging, satisfying and very strategic. Using rainspells to create puddles, and then electrifying those puddles to stun opponents is a strategy which the developers try to tout in many of the dev diaries. I went in thinking "great, thats going to be it, oh well." But when I pulled off feats such as teleporting a skeleton with a bomb on his back into a crowd of enemies, I felt a magical little feeling in my belly.\n\nThe story is pretty interesting so far, and follows two Source Hunters as they Hunt Sourcerers (Yeah, okay, its a little dumb). But its good.\n\nThe game however isn't for everyone. It may not be for those who don't enjoy reading and paying attention during their RPGs, as there is very few instances of voice acting, and even fewer instances of quest markers. Everything is derived from the well-written dialogue between your characters and NPCs, and from exploring your surroundings.\n\nThe game runs great. Let me stress that. I don't have a gaming computer, I don't even have a gaming laptop. I have a crappy Dell thats a few years old, and doesnt have a dedicated graphics card. And the game runs smooth as butter on Medium/Low.\n\nIt really is a great game, and I urge anyone who is in the mood for a very fun RPG that doesn't hold your hand to pick up a copy.\n\nOh, and there is co-op multiplayer! I haven't tried that yet, but if I had I'd probably be telling you how sexy it is.","June 26, 2014","true","41.0"," 281 of 343 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","281","343","0","2"

However, I do feel that this game is highly overrated and it is nowhere at the top of my list.

Two-player coop for the main story line, with an editor that supports creation of 4-player coop campaigns (similar to NWN's editor).\n\nCombat is turn based, built from what appears to be Pathfinder's table top combat rules, (attacks of opportunity, etc), but with Fallout's AP (action point) system, very elegantly done.\n\nThere is also a "social combat" system, where you and your friends can "fight" over dialogue choices in which a final winner ultimately decides the outcome of the conversation; this is done via rock-paper-scissors.  Character's can gain or lose personality points based on the outcome of these conversations as well, (whether they are altruistic in nature or perhaps more cut throat).  These stat changes also help in other areas later on.\n\nFinally, a living, breathing world in which there are often times multiple possible solutions to a problem.  Can't pick a lock?  Bash the door (and possibly damage your weapon in doing so).  Can't bash the door?  SET IT ON FIRE!  Etc.  Want to try to steal something but someone is watching?  Have your friend distract them with conversation!  Is something burning that shouldn't be?  Cast a rain spell or dump water on the fire.  Want to combine abilities for combat?  Have someone cast a poison cloud, and then ignite it with a flame arrow!  The list goes on and on.\n\nCrafting is similar to the Android game "Alchemy" or Minecraft, in which you start with basic items, combine them, and can ultimately craft higher level items.  This game should be a crafters dream.\n\nThe voice additions really bring the world to life, but can be a bit annoying in crowded places, as you hear multiple conversations going on at the same time.  The developers will hopefully tone this down a bit.\n\nThe world is gorgeous, filled with little details that can be seen by zooming in closely, and your characters perception trait will help you spot items (press and hold alt).  Characters range from dark and evil, to light hearted and humorous (see if you can find the very old talking clam), and is reminiscent of Baldur's Gate.\n\nAlso, NO QUEST MARKERS!  The world does not hold your hand in this aspect.  It does give you tools, such as waypoint markers for your map, that help you keep tabs on where certain things are, and it will auto-populate the map with buildings of notable remark, but the rest is up to you.  You will have to enjoy reading.\n\nAll that said, for old school RPG'ers longing for the days of old, with a new modern technology, wait no more.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin should scratch that itch.  I've spent too much time typing this, game on!","June 30, 2014","true","40.2"," 194 of 238 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","194","238","0","2"

Now only a brave few stand between Rivellon and this dark power which threatens to destroy it.\nThat's where you come in.\n\n\nMurder She Wrote\n\nIn Divinity original sin you take on the mantle of a novice source hunter (well two novice source hunters, but who's counting).\nYou've been tasked with investigating the murder of a councillor in the town of Cyseal, It's suspected the source was involved and now, like a sword and magic wielding Jessica Fletcher, It's time to figure out "who dunnit"\n\n\nThere's your trouble!\n\nAs the game opens, you'll find yourself being unceremoniously dropped off on the sunny shores of Cyseal.\nIt seems a murder isn't the only problem the town is facing. The undead are at the walls and the Orcs are attacking from the coast.\nCyseal is a town with more troubles than you could shake a level 10 elemental staff at.\n\n\nYou Go First!\n\nThe game doesn't pull any punches, even before you make it into the town of Cyseal proper, you'll have your first tactical encounter which introduces you to the turn based combat mechanics.\n\nAction points are the order of the day here, each character in your group (up to a maximum of four at any one time) will have a specific number of action points dependent on their stats and equipment. You'll spend these points moving, hacking, slashing and casting your way through these turn based encounters.\n\nCombat in D:OS is a meaty and very satisfying experience, but it's not just about sorcery and swordplay, your surroundings can play a huge part in these battles too.\n\n\nAn Inconvenient Truth\n\nEnvironmental destruction is par for the course here, and at first, you will probably do as much damage to your own group as you do to the enemy via environmental effects, that is, until you've figured a few things out.\n\nIs the floor covered in oil? then you might want to be careful of stray sparks, a misguided fireball could send the whole lot up in flames, if you happen to be standing in the oil yourself, don't expect the environment to be forgiving, you'll burn along with all the rest.\n\nThe game can be punishing at times but you'll learn to use the environment to your advantage as you progress and after a short tutorial battle and dungeon crawl, you'll progress into the town of Cyseal.\n\nIt's here that the hunt begins.\n\n\nThe Great Hunt\n\nWhen you make it into the town, you'll be greeted by a wealth of varied and interesting NPC's. A whistle stop tour of the dock front will start to open up various side quests quicker than you can say "That ships on fire!" and "Do I look like a recruitment agency?"\n\nDon't worry, the in game journal does an excellent job of keeping the ever-growing quest details in order, a feature which I've found invaluable as a memory aid following those frequent occasions where the real world dares to interfere with my  investigations.\n\n\nEye of the Beholder\n\nThe graphics do a fine job of enhancing the atmosphere of the game, from dark oppressive dungeons and gloomy rain soaked woodland to bright sunny beaches and the vibrant town of Cyseal itself, everything on screen adds something to the isometric glory.\n\n\nEar of the... Earholder\n\nWhilst some NPC's are voiced, most are not. However, there are enough lines of dialogue scattered around to give the game flavour, most of which are so full of character and voiced with such vigour you can't help but smile.\n\nLines like "I wouldn't let an orc within 500 yards of my loving nature" and "No one has as many friends as the man with many cheeses!" are great examples of the wonderfully written and often funny dialogue that awaits you here.\n\n\nSchizophrenic Encouragement\n\nThe writing is sharp and witty and the interaction between your characters can be hilarious, you can even get into arguments with yourself!\nA good example of this happened to me early on in my play through when I wanted to dig up a body to follow a lead in my investigation.\nI was just about to start wielding my trusty shovel when my comrade in arms objected.\n\nIn situations like this, you can find yourself choosing the dialogue options for both sides of the argument.\n\nI couldn't help but get on my high horse about the sanctity of the grave and disturbing the dead with my second character, whilst my first glared on, shovel in hand quipping about short sighted sensitivity derailing the investigation.\nIf arguments like this reach an impasse then your comrades will resort to a quick game of rock, paper scissors to resolve the conflict.\n\nThis is amazing fun and can lead to alternate paths you might not have considered previously as part of your investigation.\n\n\nThe road is long\n\nDivinity is long game.\nIf you're the obsessive type and feel the need to complete every side quest on offer then you can expect to spend nigh on 100 hours in Rivellon, so you'll definitely get your monies worth with regards to content...................

It takes portions of what were great about past CRPGs like the Baldur's Gate series, Fallout, Icewind Dale, and the like, and stirs it into one big pot and offers you Divinity: Original Sin.\n\nWhile the Divinity series is not new to some of us, if you can recall their other RPGs like Divine Divinity, Larian Studios pays great attention to detail and it shows.  Almost everything you do in D:OS has a consequence.  All the careful planning by Larian went into every little detail in Divinity's world.\n\nOriginal Sin is text-heavy, so do not dive in expecting complete voiceover work for every main character and NPCs.  There are the occasional voiceover work, but they are few compared to the text dialogue.  This does not spoil the great writing though, but it gives it a very "right at home" feeling for those that enjoy classic RPGs.  The dialogue is wonderful, well-written, and full of humor.  Even dark humor which is not easy to pull off.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin is a challenging game, but it is fair.  Right from the start, it does not hold your hand, but it begs you to search every corner of its vast world.  Every battle, not just boss fights, requires careful planning, strategy, and good tactics.  Your party could be wiped by a small group of common mobs.  But do not be discouraged.  Original Sin is not unfair and cheap against the player.  It simply means, you cannot just lay back and push a few buttons to win a fight so easily.  Allow me to give you one example where I was fighting this one boss, and I was down to my last party member with low health and the boss was also at low health (one hit away from death), and I managed to get off one last shot with my bow, killing it.  At the same time, there was joy, and relief.  You should also know that you can sometimes take on enemies that are 2-3 levels higher than your characters, but it requires great strategy.\n\nOne of the gameplay mechanics that really stood out for me was the ability to create different effects by applying magic and ability effects to your surroundings. For instance, if an enemy is standing in a puddle of water, you can target the water with an electric-type spell and stun your enemy for a number of turns.  Strategically speaking, you can also place oil barrels in position before battle in your enemy's path and strike it with a fireball spell, or an explosive arrow.  This gameplay mechanic fosters dynamic gameplay on the battlefield, and it rewards players that plan out their strategy.\n\nThe presentation in Divinity: Original Sin has been well executed.  The menus are easy to navigate, without all the clutter and needless micro-management.  The user interface is slick, clean, and simple yet complex in good ways.  I did not notice input lag.\n\nThe controls felt very intuitive for the most part, but not without a small learning curve.  Those that have played CRPGs before will feel right at home.  Those that have not played CRPGs before will get used to the controls within an hour or less.  The controls are very responsive, smooth, and it does not have input lag.  Mouse and keyboard work great.  I have not tried it with a controller.  Moving your party members in the levels feel responsive and fluid.\n\nWhile Divinity: Original Sin does many things right, the ending was very anti-climatic.  Without spoiling it for you, I will just say this:  Try not to think of the end and enjoy the journey.  D:OS is all about the journey, the gameplay, and the rich detail.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin was one of those games that took me by surprise.  It was a refreshing new release in 2014 that blew me away by its shear depth and classic feel.  In a sea of videogames that tend to hold your hand, Original Sin was the complete opposite of that.  It required motivation in thinking; planning out your strategy and tactics to win battles.  The reward was satisfaction from battles where you did not always know going in if you will win.  The tide turns, and you do not know if you will be the victor.  It allows for dynamic gameplay, unlike static gameplay that just lets you hit the "win button."  Larian Studios designed a game that respects the player, with a high risk, reward system that works.\n\n- Runner-up for GOTY 2014\n- Tons of Charm\n- Humoristic - includes dark humor, as well as light and funny humor\n- Classic-RPG done right in modern times\n- Most-improved developer of 2014\n- Continued Customer Support\n- Highly responsive to customer's needs with technical issues and difficulties\n- Developer/Community Manager responds to posters\n- Amazing graphics and a beautiful game engine\n- Optimization is well done - D:OS runs smooth at 80fps+ on maxed settings at 1080p (as of this review, GTX 670, i5-2500k CPU)\n- Several display and graphics options\n- There is a NO-DRM version from other suppliers like GOG if you choose not to buy it from Steam.  More options is good.\nYou really owe it to yourself to play this RPG.\n\nRating:  9.5 out of 10","July 8, 2014","true","116.2"," 104 of 130 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","104","130","0","17"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/3InkSheep/recommended/230230/","3InkSheep","3InkSheep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/3InkSheep/","218 products in account","Divinity: Origin Sin is a top-down, turned-based Role-Playing-Game that does without the hand-holding, 'let me guide you through my story and you'll learn to love it' experience. There's a huge emphasis on freedom; genuine freedom, not the kind that lets you do what you want for five minutes before prompting you there's a quest you should be doing. In short, Divinity: Origin Sin raises it's middle finger to the concept of guidance and allows the player to decide what to do and when to do it.\n\nGraphics:\n\nIn every aspect, this game is beautiful, and arguablly one of the best looking games, not just within it's genre, but within in all games, ever.\n\nFrom the huge towns filled with NPC's to the lonely mountain passes, the game world feels alive and genuine; never do you feel like you're following a path, you feel as you should, as if you're exploring this huge, open world with a story behind it, and everyone within.\n\nIt's difficult to describe the graphics in this game purely because they're done so well. There is particle effects, high-quality textures, gorgeous lighting and a strong sense of atmosphere everywhere you go. You might be exploring an old celler, in which case it's misty and gloomy, whilst in town centres the sun is pumping pure beauty upon the entire world. The game is simply gorgeous and without doubt, the best looking game within it's genre, by a large margin.\n\nAudio:\n\nFrom the subtle creeks of floor-boards to the raging torrents that is the mountain pass winds, Divnity: Origin Sin delivers a flawless experience in auditory experience.\n\nThe best possible way to explain the quality of audio in this game would be to ask you to think of a game, any game at all that you think has the best audio. You might say Amnesia because it's subtle but terrorfying or perhaps you might say Child of Light for it's amazing soundtracks, and both would be correct, and I'm sure other examples you might have suggested would be too, but most games have one particular aspect within it's audio that's memorable or excels in some aspect. This isn't true for Divinity: Origin Sin. This game excels in every aspect, from voice acting to the empowering shimmers and charges that spark when casting a spell.\n\nIt's simply perfect - And that's not a comment I would make lightly.\n\nGameplay:\n\nDivinity: Origin Sin is a turn-based game, but only within combat. Outside of combat you're free to explore and roam the world in any way you please. You might find yourself engaging enemies that are a few levels higher than you; you might help an old man steal some fish, then report him to the guards and watch him be dragged away to prison or perhaps you simply want to go around the entire world slaying every single living thing that stands in your way. Freedom is what makes Divinity: Origin Sin so immersive and enjoyable, you're never tied down or told what to do, or when.\n\nThis game is hardcore, but not in regards to it's difficulty, more in terms of how it presents itself. There are no exclimation marks above NPC's heads to signify importance. There is no charts or tables to show you crafting receipes. There is a lot missing, but it's a very positive aspect of the game that makes it so much more enjoyable and immersive than other Role-Playing-Games. To find out how to craft a weapon, a potion or how to cook a pie, you must find a book, or a note and read it. You won't unlock the receipe, everything is available to craft as long as you know how to do it. Once you find the receipe, you simply need to refer back to it when creating the item. When deciding to complete quests, to find out where to go or what to do, you must talk to NPC's and listen. The information given to you is only useful if you read what was said. There will be no waypoint given or a 'Hey, good job finding that clue, i'll remove all challenge from this game and simply tell you what to do now'. It's challenging, but rewarding.\n\nThe combat is much alike what you would expect. Every character involved within the combat scenario will take turns, have a set amount of action points and, if they choose, can reserve points for future turns. The system is very fluid and intuative. What makes the combat, and gameplay so enjoyable however, is the emphasis on environmental interaction. See a group of enemies standing in water? Why not zap them with lightning and fry them? -No? How about we freeze the water and stick them in their place. Perhaps you want to spill some oil and ignite it, or perhaps use a teleport spell to throw an enemy off a cliff. If you can think of it, you can probably do it.\n\nNarrative and Lore:\n\nNow I'll admit, I'm not the kind of person who is likely to sit down and read every piece of lore or material in a game, especially not role-playing-games. I generally don't have the patience nor' interest, so perhaps this next statement will give some meaning to the quality of the writing in this game.\n\nI've played for about 15 hours, at the time of writing this review, and have read every single piece of material I've found, and generally find it annoying when I then switch to co-op, and have my partner skip through it all. The writing in this game is really well written, and because of the nature of the game, enaging and meaningful. I know if I don't read it, I won't know what to do. It's almost like a very intelligent scheme plotted by the developers to discourage skipping through material, and I like that.\n\nCo-op:\n\nThe game allows for four characters to be played at any given time, in co-op, you can play alongside another player and control up to two each. There is no limations in co-op, everything you can do it single player, you can do it co-op, but arguablly, it's more enjoyable when played with a friend due to a feature that allows you to argue amongst your characters about what choices to make it quests. Perhaps I want to slay the target, whilst you want to help them. Lets discuss it with in-game dialouge, then argue and see who wins. It's genuinally enjoyable and adds a new layer to the immersion of the games experience.\n\nThere is also a mod, for those interested, that allows the game to be played four-player co-op, so if that's of interest, good news for you!\n\nMods and Editors:\n\nThat game supports workshop, mods and even comes with the developer tools to create your own custom campaigns. I've toyed around with this a little, and not being a guru of game development software, I can say it's actually pretty easy to use. There is some script-writing to do when creating dialouges, cutscenes or combat sequences, but there are plenty of easy-to-understand tutorials that can be found within the discussion pages of the Steam community hub as well as on media sites such as YouTube to help guide beginners in creating their own mods.\n\nWhilst I'm unlikely to spend much time using these features myself, it's a great addition to have and ultimately means there's a huge pool of endless content to play with once you've completed the main game. That's never a bad thing.\n\nOverall:\n\nDivinity: Origin Sin is a beautifully crafted RPG that was obviously created by developers who genuinally cared about their product. Every aspect of the game feels polished once, and once again. The game runs perfectly at maximum settings on my GTX 760 and AMD FX-8350 at more than 120FPS solid, without hiccups. The gameplay is hugely enjoyable, the lore is engaging and the hardcore approach to giving the player complete freedom makes this one of the best turn-based role-playing-games, ever.\n\nNo game is without it's flaws ~ I just can't single out anything I dislike, honestly it's near perfect.\n\nIt's a masterpiece, a genuine must buy for any RPG fan.\n~One of the most enjoyable and engaging experiences to be found within gaming.[/b]","November 26, 2014","true","89.2"," 90 of 113 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","90","113","2","0"

Imagine playing the game as 2 characters, you prioritize one character as your main character, so you think for him/her and make decisions for them on their behalf but there is what makes it different from other role playing games - your secondary character has a say in your choices, they can agree with you or disagree with you and if they disagree with you, then that choice can change the out come of the quest or the storyline as a whole. You cannot control them but they may change the mind of an npc for example which may make you angry. So think of it as simulating playing co-op with a real human and being able to communicate with them on making choices throughout the game's timeline. Similar to old school dungeons and dragons pen and paper games in that respect. I feel that is one of the game's main selling features as it makes the game very unique.\n\nThe graphics of Divinity: Original Sin are beautiful, it's a modern looking rpg with an old soul and it reflects on the art style it possesses. I love Larian for this. The game features alot of sneaking, lock-picking and diversions. I found it very entertaining to find I could enter a shop with one character, start a conversation with the shop owner and while in mid-conversation, switch to the other character and sneak in to steal weapons and other items because the shop owner was distracted.  Small things like this make me really enjoy this game.\n\nThe combat is difficult but fair. You must think about your moves ahead of time of you want to survive. Know when to preserve energy or run. The storyline doesn't take itself to seriously, there are animals to talk to and alot of moments that might make you laugh out loud. There is alot of depth here though. This game features crafting. You can craft items such as different kinds of arrows. So if you are a lovecraftian, you will feel at home here. But don't worry you don't HAVE to craft there is tons of items already in the game as well.\n\nPros  Interesting story and side-quests\nEndless dual-dialouge possibilities\nClassses are well designed\nCons  Classic version does not sport controller support\nDoesn't run as smoothly as the Enhanced version\nGraphics are average\nFinal Thoughts:\nTo close this review before I keep talking about how great this game is all morning long, this game has everything you might want from a western rpg, mixing modern gameplay aesthetics wiith old-school traits of the genre as well. It's a great game I think any rpg fan will enjoy!\n\nRating (9.2 out of 10)\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","January 13","true","12.6"," 48 of 51 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","48","51","2","3"

In a year otherwise flooded with terrible games and inexcusable moneygrabbing plain awfulness, Divinity: Original Sin stands out. The developers loved it and listened to the community and it shows - A passion for RPGs and a love for the setting is poured into this game. More specifically, this game has the best combat seen in an RPG ever. Ever. Character development is interesting and every combat is tactical enough that it always feels like it matters how you play. Did you die in a combat and have to reload? Try a different tactic, some different spells and different movements and even the thoughest enemy can be beaten. To clarify, what makes it so beautiful and awesome to play is that it manages to be tough and challenging without being unfairly punishing.\nThat said, the story is so-so - A half-bad fantasy novel with a run-of-the-mill story.

It is a game with many glaring flaws, and those flaws are part of the reason I've come to love it. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but those who can stomach its initial few sluggish hours will find a meaty turn-based RPG that pays thorough respect to its CRPG predecessors like Baldur's Gate.\n\nThose familiar with pen & paper RPGs, as well as roguelike elements, will feel right at home here. Combat is tough and involved. The game uses mechanics familiar to paper players while being relatively accessible to modern gamers (none of that THAC0 nonsense!). Larian has developed a smart, stern RPG that offers its charm in its unforgivingly old-school game design with absolutely zero handholding. Very few map markers. No quest arrows. Why am I surrounded by level 15 invincible enemies at level 10?!\n\nIf you like Dungeons & Dragons or TBRPGs in similar veins like Shadowrun Returns, you owe it to yourself to play Divinity: Original Sin.

There are aspects about them that I absolutely adore, and there are aspects of them that make me grind my teeth.\n\nTake Baldur's Gate, for example. It's classic. Iconic, even. For good reason, too. It's solidly-built, has a beautifully-designed world, interesting characters, a great story, and a fantastic open-world feel. It also has brutally-difficult try-try-again fights, a moderate lack of direction, and quite a few bugs/glitches. The first time I played BG, I had a game-breaking bug 30 hours in, and was dead in the water.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin is certainly similar in that some-good-some-bad regard. During my playthrough, I found a lot to love, and a lot to hate. The story is well-crafted and interesting (although it does ramble), the characters each have their own motivations/backstories (and quests), it's open-world enough for you to miss important things if you aren't paying attention, the graphics are pretty good, and it's a meaty enough adventure to please anyone flying high off a recent dose of Baldur's Gate 2.\n\nNow, before I list the cons I found, I have to re-state that I did enjoy the game. I definitely recommend it overall (especially since the enhanced "remastered" version is coming out for free soon), but there are bound to be people out there just as nitpicky as me, so I have to list what bugged me.\n\nFirst of all, the difficulty in the first half of the game is RIDICULOUS. You will always be in an area, able to explore at your heart's content, surrounded on all sides but one by enemies that will curb-stomp you into oblivion. As a result, this "open-world" game is ostensibly linear, given there's only one area you can go to unless you want your face and limbs rearranged, redesigned, or removed. Then, once you hit somewhere just after the mid-point, battle difficulty falls off a cliff, and you'll be skating through gigantic brawls with ease. I can't really count that as a con, though, since it was a welcome relief for my poor molars.\n\nFollowing right along with the difficulty, the balance in the game is really bad. For the first 50 hours, I built my main character as a ranger. She had high dexterity and speed, a fantastic legendary bow, and a full complement of gear boosting her bow skills. Battles were difficult, but doable. Then, 51 hours in, I found a unique dagger with high damage. I equipped it just to see what a dagger was like (changing literally nothing else I had equipped, even MY SKILLS), and became untouchable. Having spent 2/3 of the game outfitting myself as a ranger, and barely having any dagger skills at all didn't matter. One tiny equipment change, and I was zipping around the arena like a meth-head on fast forward, poking fatal holes in enemies left and right. I wasn't sneaking or backstabbing, just walking right up to mages and barbarians alike, and handily beating them toe-to-toe.\n\nGranted, in RPGs, certain builds will always be more viable against certain enemies, but there were no scenarios that proved difficult for my little stabbing princess. It was funny and all, but when there is that big of a difference between build strengths, there is a problem. To be fair, there were a few pretty solid mages behind me providing support, but that half-♥♥♥♥♥ little dagger build was making even Madora (who is a BEAST of a warrior) look silly. I kid you not when I say I alone went head-to-head with the final boss while the rest of the team was cleaning up the trash he repeatedly spawned. It was so overpowered, it reminded me of the old JRPGs of my youth, when I would give all the best gear/upgrades to the main character, and trickle the hand-me-downs to the rest of the team (and it would be perfectly viable).\n\nI wasn't trickling anything down to the rest of the team here, though, since each character had an almost completely unique set of equipment requirements. I had a ranger, a warrior, a spell-mage, and a wizard, all of which were focusing on different stats.\n\nBefore I switch down to talk about the smaller niggles and quirks, I have to talk about the combat system, the glitchy, buggy, nothing-short-of-poorly-designed combat system. The main problem I had with it is that enemies dance around a bit while they're idle, and there's no way to pause while giving orders, so targeting is a big fat ol' pain. Essentially, when you click on an enemy to attack, there's a chance the enemy's idle animation just leaned back and roared, making the game think you want to move to the spot of ground right where their head used to be. Even taking off my shoes won't help me count the number of times my character wasted an entire turn running across the arena to stand next to the enemy I just told her to shoot. Plus, there is no way to pause or cancel orders, so bye-bye turn, and good luck standing right next to that massive flaming demon, ranger. Literally the entire game, I was on edge about pixel-perfect mouse positioning and idle animations when I attacked.\n\nPlus, getting the mouse cursor to recognize enemies is not the easiest thing to begin with. If a small enemy is standing behind a larger one (according to the camera), they can literally be impossible to target, even if the character you're controlling could reach out and slap them. I was BEGGING for free camera rotation (it only swivels maybe 30° currently) and a dedicated pause button.\n\nMy final issue (and the big one) about the combat system is that it straight-up lies. For example, Madora will be standing right next to an enemy, and to attack him, she requires 4 AP (action points). In reality, though, once you click to attack, Madora BACKS UP, giving the enemy an attack of opportunity (despite never leaving melee range), and costing an extra movement AP. Your turn plan is now screwed up, and you're injured. Sometimes those little details are signalled to you beforehand (it shows movement and attacks of opportunity), but sometimes they are not. Plus, it's not unheard of for skills that cost 6 AP, for example, to show you on the hot bar that they're only really going to cost 4 AP (they really do cost 6), so pay attention. Let's also not forget that the game often incorrectly calculates how many AP you will need to use. I noticed this a lot towards the end of the game. My dagger girl's attack cost 2 AP, but sometimes when I'd be standing right next to an enemy, it would say 3 AP required. When I attack, only 2 AP are used (as should be the case), but then it again says my next attack will cost 3 AP while it really costs 2. Repeat until you only have 2 AP, when the game will hold up its hands and stop you. Nevermind that you should only be using 2 AP and ARE using only 2 AP each time you've stood in that exact spot and attacked that exact enemy that exact turn, if the game thinks you need 3, you're done.\n\nThere are a bunch more problems with the combat system, but to sum up, it can't be trusted, and it is the undeniable weak point in the entire game. I would have very few complaints if they fixed it.\n\nOther than those issues, the game is pretty great. It has 70+ hours of content, enough exploration/quests to keep you busy the whole time, full campaign co-op, multiple companions you can bring (Madora and Jafar were my 2), a whole slew of attributes/skills/perks to build your unique character with, and just about anything else you would expect from an isometric RPG. It's a fantastic example of how isometric cRPGs can be brought forward into the future.","August 25, 2015","true","90.2"," 77 of 99 people (78%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","78","77","99","9","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/recommended/230230/","FlamesSuperior","UpInFlames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/","263 products in account","Complexity. It’s an old RPG trait largely forgotten by a lot of gamers and ignored by most developers. If you like your RPG’s action-oriented and filled with commodities such as quest markers, move right along. Divinity: Original Sin from Belgian developer Larian assumes you’re prepared to actually figure out quite a bit all on your own. It provides a large game world and simply lets you wander around in it. Areas aren’t closed off, all quests can be finished in at least two different ways and you won’t be punished for playing your own way. It brings about the kind of design philosophy that really should exist in every RPG, regardless of its style, combat system or any other differentiating feature.\n\nThe story follows two main protagonists who start out as Source Hunters trying to figure out a local murder mystery. Naturally, soon they find themselves involved in something much bigger including an orc invasion, undead uprising, mad kings in a frozen land inhabited by elementals and they’ll even visit other dimensions and take to the heavens. Unfortunately, this is the weakest part of the game as the writing isn’t particularly compelling and the characterization is awfully shallow, especially regarding the playable characters. Speaking of which, apart from the two main characters, you’ll be able to recruit more people along the way. However, you’ll only be able to keep up to four in your party. Any others will await for your call in a place called the Hall of Heroes if you get the urge to switch them up a bit.\n\nThe only real reason to switch characters is to try out different classes and tactics. The character upgrade system is extremely deep and customizable, each class is extremely different with a load of unique traits, abilities and spells. And it’s extremely flexible as well. Just because you committed to a certain class at the beginning doesn’t mean you’re stuck with it if you change your mind. On the contrary, you can mix things up and create something like a rogue specialized in fire spells. You can customize all characters further with weapons and equipment you find along the way. And there’s a ton of loot in this game. Upgrading and customizing your character as well as constantly finding new loot is a huge source of addiction and probably the biggest motivation to continue playing.\n\nOriginal Sin has a turn-based combat system which is awesome because it’s not an under-the-hood system with pause, but with actual turns akin to a regular turn-based strategy game. Apart from being able to witness the myriad of different combat styles, the combat shines thanks to its fantastic convergence of elemental powers. For example, summoning rain will create puddles on the ground and will make your enemies wet. Throwing a lightning bolt onto one enemy will fry him, but will also zap anyone standing in a puddle nearby. Then you can throw a fireball which will dry out the puddles and create mist that will cause enemies to have limited sight. Frozen surfaces will make characters slip and fall, spilled poison can be ignited for additional damage, the possibilities are nearly endless. Naturally, considering that everything you cast on the battlefield will affect your party as well, you have to be careful what you’re doing at all times. It’s just a superb system that never gets old.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin is a fantastic looking game, however the art style isn’t particularly distinctive and falls under usual fantasy tropes a bit too often. The same can be said about the soundtrack, it’s definitely pleasing and appropriate, but just doesn’t really stand out in any way. My biggest complaint about the game is that it can be incredibly obtuse at times, particularly regarding the puzzle design. You will actually get hints from books and other sources, but I honestly don’t know what frame of mind you have to be in to figure some of this stuff out. This can get especially frustrating due to how big the world is and considering that a lot of quests span across multiple huge areas.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin is one of the big Kickstarter success stories – a rewarding, addictive and unapologetic hardcore RPG brimming with complexity, gameplay depth and content breadth. If only it had a more motivating story, more interesting characters and a more unique game world, it would have been a masterpiece. Still, a few design quibbles aside, this is a great game that will delight anyone looking for a true RPG that brings back cherished genre values and wraps them up in a modern package.\n\n8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)","November 6, 2014","true","76.9"," 71 of 95 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","71","95","0","0"

While its excellent world interactivity and in-depth crafting system were things which were talked about and demonstrated before the release, and the typical Larian humour in quests and writing could be expected, its sheer level of quality in other regards is simply off the scale.\n\nThe battle system may be the best in any computer role playing game ever created. The combination of a full set of modern features, including attacks of opportunity, with an initiative / action point system, free movement and a highly polished user interface is a joy to play and strategize with.\n\nHowever, what truly sets the game apart is the versatility in terms of player agency which it offers. Ideas which you might never even consider in other games, or which might not even be possible to attempt, are not only possible to execute but actually work. This level of interactivity, combined with the very well developed system of elemental area effects and their interaction, allows for an almost infinite number of possibilities for solving situations, both in battles and during exploration.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who likes using their head while playing.","July 6, 2014","true","76.0"," 51 of 64 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","51","64","0","1"

I know it would be cool to have a 2*1h character, which can attack multiple times, but as it seems the developers didn't implemented it. Was it difficult to make changes in the code they had so far? Was it because they thought 1h is easier than 2*1h to handle (as the offhand has to have some penalties)? Was it because of the game's balance? Either way, with a rogue and a dagger at level 3, you can make 8 backstabs in a single turn.

My thoughts are based on co-op game from top to bottom.\n\nPros:\n+ Character interactions with each other are well made and bring nice touch to game. It's too seldom when you can argue with your co-op partner in these games. But luckily Divinity delivers nicely with this.\n+ Battles are well made and there are plenty of different aspects you need to take into account. Personally I was little disappointed that hardest battles where in the first 20 hours of playing. It might be that towards the end you know the battle system better, or you are overpowered, but I would have hoped last fights would have been a bit harder. All in all battles are still a huge plus for this game.\n+ Puzzles are challenging and it is fun to complete them, you need to study the environment and lorebooks and talk to other characters. But puzzles are not too hard for you to complete, they just might take some time. Better have a character with good perception, it helps a LOT.\n+Side quests, a large diversity of different quests, some totally random and some so obvious, but these side quests bring plenty of diversity and they challenge you on different ways than the main story.\n\nCons\n- Maybe a bit sloppy main story, and it felt somewhat forced. Don't get me wrong, it could have been a lot worse.\n- We completed the game with the same "sidekicks". Once we tried to hire a new hero to our party, but they seemed to be a bit useless, and changing from your normal sidekick to the new one was made little bit annoying, as all the stuff that the other one was carrying needed to be transfered first to your main characters inventory and from there to your new sidekicks inventory.\n- SPOILER!!!  You can't continue to play with your characters after beating the final boss. Personally i would have liked to return to town as hero and still keep doing some side quests.\n\nRating\n****/*****","April 26, 2015","true","77.9"," 38 of 49 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","38","49","4","2"

From there, the plot escalates and the setting becomes increasingly varied and interesting. Exploration is a highlight in this game with tons of secrets, quests and character to be found often tucked away in little hidden areas. You are given the chance to create both source hunters at the start of the game. Original Sin follows a classless system that encourages minor multiclassing without becoming a jack of all trades, as certain enemies are immune or even absorb certain elements.\n\nThe gameplay of D:OS is a highlight and one of the most talked-about features. There are dozens of interesting reactions between spells, skills, status effects and different types of terrain. A charging warrior can slip on ice, a cloud of steam can be zapped to turn into a cloud of static, or a wet, chilled enemy can be frozen on the spot. All of this makes for fun, tactical combat. It initially seems slow but you'll want the time to plan, as the game is incredibly difficult, especially during boss fights are fights against large amounts of enemies. They too use status effects often.\n\nNow, for the graphics and sound. The visuals are highly customisable via the settings, allowing the game to run on old machines, whilst also allowing for some impressive visuals and effects on newer rigs. Animations are average, but spell and skill effects look very nice. One negative is the enemy animations. Some get unique effects, but I often saw generic enemy mages using generic animations for spells of different elements, which was boring and a little confusing. The sound is fantastic, the game has high-quality voice acting for both the player characters and NPCs. There's ambient dialogue which repeats a little too often, but has a very charming Fable-like to it. 'Noone has as many friends as the man with many cheeses!' The music is absolutely top-notch in every respect. Eargasms all round.\n\nThank you for reading my review!","July 2, 2014","true","30.7"," 47 of 65 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","47","65","0","3"

I very much enjoy the art style of the game, and all of the vibrant colors in the envorinment and abilities.\n\nThe interaction with spells/abilities and the environment is phenomenal. Cast an oil spell that will slolw enemies, and follow it up by casing a fire spell that does its initial fire damage, and 100% chance to inflict the burning status ailment.\n\nLarian Studios' decision to use turn-based combat instead of real-time combat has paid off. You will question your moves on every turn in combat. If there are too many enemies to deal with (within your level range), look around, there is almost always a way to equalize the battles, you just need to have the right tools.\n\nThe ability to have companions/mercenaries is great. Equip your comrades how ever you see fit, and make them your mule by stashing all your crap in their inventory!\n\n* Do note that Divinity: Original Sin only supports 2-player co-op in a drop in/out type of game. At the start of creating a new co-op campaign, you'll create two new heroes. Those two heroes will be the playable characters for you and your friend for the remainder of the campaign. If you wish to reroll, you must start a new co-op campaign with two new heroes! If your friend has to leave for a bit, s/he may log off, and you can do mundane things like sneak around town and pickpocket everyone until they get back! Their character will become AI until they log back into your game.\n\n** There is apparently a Divinity: Original Sin 4-player multiplayer mod!

I had no crashing or other major bug issues though I understand some people have had some issues. The most irritating thing is probably the looping dialog which the most recent patch should now have fixed.\n\nAs an old school RPG fan this game hits the spot perfectly.  I am playing only the single player version. Combat and exploration requires a small amount of strategy, it is an open world to explore but if your normal play style is to charge and attack you may be frequently frustrated.  Enemy have set levels and may greatly overpower you if you engage the wrong group to soon but you have many options to deal with them and defeating them may be possible with the right strategy or you can simply turn around and find a fight more at your level.\n\nQuest locations are not maped and marked out for you, you will have to explore and find them, despite my 30 hours of play I dont feel I have gotten very far into the game yet and at this point I couldnt tell you what the main quest line is in the game there are several important issues that need resolving and perhaps they all tie in.  Addmitiedly I havent bothered to look in the quest journal very much yet but I have felt no need except in one case.  So my guide to the game has not been I need to go here and do this but more of can I go here and survive at this point.\n\n\nThe first part of the game dose start out a bit slow since it is in a large city area that needs to be mostly explored in order to do well once you head into the wilds.\n\nThere is an issues that for me is minor but could use some work, so far I have found only Two NPC that are scripted there are also hirelings that you can replace them with if you wish but they are not scripted, I am not sure if there are other scripted NPC that can join you but at this point the game could certainly use more veriety there.\n\n\nI would rate this a 9.5 and possible Game of the Year for me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow here is my original early access review.\n\n\nThis Is one of very few games I didnt wait on for a sale price.  This is an ambitious game and Larian Studios still has thier work cut out for them.  I dont like to spend much time on forum boards or trying to find all the bugs in betas to report them, but I have faith in Larian Studios and I belive they are going to deliver one of the best RPG experiences in years, so I decided to support this on early access.\n\nIf your looking to be entertained by polished game play of any sort then I can't recomend you buy this on early access.  The pop up menu to start the game was sized wrong and while I could see three buttons they where cut off and I couldnt read what they did. I tested them and learned the first button was to start the game.  I went into the game set up screen first thing, as I do with all new games to make some adjustments. Pre set graphics and sound seemed fine but I decided to change key binding configurations and several of the buttons on this screen had no text discriptions. After testing the buttons I figured out which ones did what I wanted and had a key binding set up that I desired but once I started the game a loading screen showed me that several of the keys I had set up where used for something else that had not been listed on the key binding page and within the game dialogs would show the original key bindings and not my selected ones as the correct keys to hit.  So I went back into key bindings and set them to default figuring that was the best way to go for now.\n\nIn the game I had some difficulty with controlls, the mouse would scroll the screen as expected when I moved curser to the edge of the screen except when I moved it to the center of the bottom area, in order to scroll down I had to either hit the down arrow key or move the pointer to the left or right side of the bottom of the screen.  Next I was confused by what I expected from normall left click movement. I was not sure at points if this was terrain I couldnt walk on or a realy buggie AI but them I accedently clicked on a region that was on the other side of a fairly long cliff and my characters went thier on thier own very smoothly.  After fooling around with movement for awhile I learned that single clicking on near by locations would frequently result in buggy or no movement while distant locations worked well and holding down left click to move worked well.\n\n\nAfter that things went fairly smooth.  There was an easy combat, then I found a city and was amused by the caracter dialog exchange, In single player there is an option to have each of your character be able to take part in conversations similar to how it will be in multi player.  After a few conversations I decided to explore randomly looking for something to fight I ran into a pack of skelletons that where to powerful for me so I fled then I ran into a pack of orcs that where to powerful for me and fled then on a whim I blasted some guards with a fireball and fled.  That was about the end of my play session and I doubt I will play to much more before the full game release.\n\n\nSo if this sounds dreadful to you do not buy this early access, unless like me you have faith that a polished final product will eventually be delivered and want to throw in your support. I  do not regret buying this game at this point, it is no more then I expected.\n\n\n\n\nJust an update since the game has moved into beta all of the issues above have been cleared up, the game dose seem to now be in a more enjoyable playable state, but it is to early for an overall review as there are still many bugs that need polish.","January 17, 2014","true","150.6"," 43 of 59 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","43","59","0","0"

All that, on top of the fact it seems it was designed from the ground up with a co-operative multi-player system in mind, such that the game doesn't suffer at all if you play it alone, but if another player is present, it effects every part of the game in a positive way.\n\nThere are very, very few games that I will give an unreserved recommendation for, but this is one of them, because I feel that if you've played Divinity: Original Sin and don't enjoy it, then you're probably an alien lizard wearing a human's skin, and you should be out conquering our planet not playing computer games anyway :P","July 16, 2014","true","39.8"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","29","36","2","11"

Larian allowed nothing to hinder their vision for their creation; their love for games and the players who enjoy them serves as the greatest foundation in the making of D:OS.  From gameplay, design philosophy, dedicated patches post-launch, Larian has such confidence in their product because they have faith that their players would appreciate their steadfast, dedicated approach than cave in to the poison of modern culture.\n\nWhether you love or hate Divinity, one could not deny the amount of love, respect, and effort Larian put into this game.  It's an example that anyone should  be following in their daily lives.\n\nAs a result, D:OS performs marvelously on all fronts.\n\nGraphics: It's a CRPG, so let's set the bar realistically.  Rivellon in D:OS is simply gorgeous.  The colours and art bring out the atmosphere of the locations.  Weather effects are sharp and clear.  Spell and weapon effects are a charm to behold.  The attention to detail and polish makes this play like a modern game.\n\nSound/Voice Acting/Writing: The sound effects are solid.  There is nothing I do in game where the sound effects were inappropriate or unconvincing, from combat to walking through different weather terrains.  Not all NPCs are voiced, but when they are it is definitely well written and acted out convincingly.  Voice acting was always a strength when it came to Larian's games and I really did wish that there were more of them in D:OS.\n\nWriting is another one of Larian's strongest skills.  Taste in writing is subjective.  The two previous games share this trait and D:OS doesn't escape this formula.  Unlike them, most of the writing is read rather than voiced.  It doesn't make the writing any less effective, yet the voice acting in the previous games also displayed the skills of the voice actors and how Larian will not attempt at anything less than stellar.\n\nMusic: Although taste in music is subjective, you cannot accuse Larian for doing their soundtracks poorly.  The quality is excellent.\n\nStory Progression: The beauty about how this game works is the content comes to you the more you talk to people.  The more people you talk to, the more quests you get, the more variety of solutions to solve quests open to you.  Character abilities could be enhanced through dialogue.  It also gives you the freedom to kill quest givers, emphasizing on the lack of hand holding in this game.  For those who complain about the main story progression is in reality linear and how it is pretending to be open world, I might need to remind you that Dragon Age: Origins was also linear in spite offering 5 factions to recruit.  In addition, in Fallout: New Vegas you were not advised to take the shortest path to get to Vegas from the beginning.  I loved both games and they both failed at attempting to make the main story feel non-linear.\n\nCombat: Combat is turn based, and that is subjective.  The use of environment as a key addition to your tactics, however, is worthy of praise.  The game encourages you to make good use of all the elements at your disposal so you are capable of winning a battle you would not otherwise win by capitalizing the terrain.  If the terrain is not in your favour, the option of making your own environment is there.  The doors of variety are open, making every battle a different one.\n\nDRM/Microtransactions: It has no reason to exist.\n\nFree Companion DLC: This action is extremely pro-consumer and it speaks volumes of how Larian treats their players.  These two members give your party a good mix up and adds variety to the game.  Larian had no reason to do this for free, but they wanted players to have more experiences than less.\n\nKickstarter Success: Larian proved to us that they are very capable of not cheating money that came from good faith.  Given the amount of abuse and horror stories from many developers that failed to create a game to live up to the expectations or simply scammed the contributors, D:OS is a beacon of example.\n\nAll said and done, no doubt this is a 10/10, right?\n\nNo.  I adore the game and it's my favorite game of the year, but it's not a 10/10.  D:OS does so many things right so well that it's all the more glaring when it does something wrong.\n\nCharacter Customization: Due to how the character progression is designed in D:OS, hybrids can easily become mediocre if points are allocated wrong.  This limits one's creativity and encourages pures to be made due to simplicity and efficiency.  Despite that, pure builds also have a problem from the inaccessibility to crucial spells.  The best example is the Two Handed Knight.  Both AoE attacks are very limited in the game.  One of them can only be selected through character creation.  The other one comes very scarcely.   Respec removes all abilities you have, thus you cannot make any errors on an AoE Knight.  How could handicapping a build and punishing trial and error exist here? Players won't know any of this information unless they read up all the info before hand.\n\nRNG: Although it's a necessary system, this makes an already slow game even slower.  Players want all the legendary gear vendors sell and will reload the game over and over until they find the pieces they want.  Vendors reset their inventory every level and thus this happens with multiple vendors on every level up.  Any loot-able source that can drop legendaries will have the player reloading the game until a desired piece drops.\n\nCrafting:  As wonderful it may be to see that there is little hand holding and the abundance of freedom, I wish the crafting wasn't so overwhelming.  It's annoying to be bombarded with so many different items and have little idea regarding how to use them.  I don't want the game to be simple, but it would've been great if there was something to point players towards the right direction.\n\nWhat do all have in common?\n\nTime Consumption: The above factors all contribute to many very time consuming activities in addition to the 80 to 100 hours it requires to finish the game.  The game is marvelous in its own right indeed, yet when it demands this much time from its players it's vital to make the experience as efficient as possible.  Let's face it, we all have a limited of time each day to play games due to real life commitments, and Larian needs to figure out how to make the most use of our time when we offer it.  It's frustrating to be engaged in a game for hours just to find yourself accomplishing little.\n\nWhat's even more tragic is that Larian had no intention of doing this.  They embraced all the ideas they wanted in a great game, worked so diligently to create a masterpiece, and yet in oversight their creation caused a dilemma that would've easily destroyed games of lower caliber.  That proves just how powerful and brilliant D:OS is.  When you're doing stuff it feels like DA: Origins.  When it doesn't it leave you hungering more for what could have been if the pacing was more efficient.  I believe it could potentially surpass DA: Origins with the last stroke of polish.\n\nRegardless of these flaws, due to my adoration to Divinity, I'll be giving all the time that's required of me to experience D:OS thoroughly.  However, not everyone will be compelled to give Larian such grace, and this notion hurts the presentation of the game.  No one can justify why there's little to no progress in a game after putting hours of their free time into it.\n\nI pray that there are upcoming DLCs and detailed patches that could remedy the issues.  D:OS was ever so close to perfection.\n\nFinal Verdict: 8.7/10 (How I wish this was a 9/10)\n\nThis package of love, respect and care is only $40.  Support Larian for what they do and there will be hope that their next Divinity game will outperform Original Sin.  They are real risk takers, unafraid to make whatever they feel is fun, and have the integrity, talent, character and dignity to back it up.","December 3, 2014","true","440.7"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","30","38","0","0"

My overall thoughts:\n\nPros:\n- It's a classic RPG style game in our modern day of gaming. Yay!\n- Decent enough graphics for what it is.\n- Good length to the game - doesn't end 6 hours after purchase like so many titles do nowadays.\n- Interesting changes in terrain and level design.\n- Interesting use of elemental interaction for spells.\n- Love the allowance of coop play. It's nice to have an RPG I can play with my partner.\n\nCons:\n- Dialogue/story is overly verbose and unnecessarily convoluted. Everyone has countless paragraphs to babble on through when the message is often very simple. I get that it's meant to be old-timey fantasy speech, but plenty of other RPGs succeeded in that feel without dragging on text forever.\n- Lot of game crashing bugs still. I'm running 64-bit Windows 7 on a top end custom built computer, so I truly believe there are no issues on my end (heck, I run everything else just fine on ultra settings).\n- Lot of bugs and glitches in general, actually.\n- NPCs dialogue spam (particularly in Cyseal) is just obnoxious.\n- If my partner is initiating dialogue, why can't I just read it with him? I can get past this using the Journal or whatever, but why can't I just flipping see it like in any other game if I'm standing RIGHT THERE? Stupid. Oh, and aforementioned NPC spam does not help this issue.\n- Combat seems to become repetitive upon reaching higher levels. You end up using the same tactics against enemies, and none of them really pose a challenge once you have your resistances set up. Seems mostly a game of "Who can stun lock who the longest?!"\n- Crafting and inventory system could use several improvements.\n- Really bad loot system.\n- Broken achievements.\n- And my least favorite thing of this game - Rock paper scissors to determine winner when it came to dialogue debates (intimidate, charm, reason) as opposed to rolling checks like DnD style based on stats. Made me nerdrage to the max having to go through that crap over and over and over again.\n\n... and so on and so forth. I could make a bigger list or go into further detail, but I think this gives a good summary of my beef with it.\n\nI'm disappointed. Divinity: Original Sin could have been a great game. In fact, it's style of play is one of my favorites in gaming, and yet it falls short due to all its bugs and game design choices. I have no idea how the developers could have even remotely seen some of their decisions as good.\n\nI ultimately rate this title around a C- due to my lack of enjoyment in story, end game combat, and due to the amount of game breaking bugs.","July 20, 2014","false","61.6"," 443 of 755 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","443","755","0","41"

The nurse there had a healing stone, but it had only enough charge to cure one of the patients.\n\nThe other would die.\n\nWe realised this was no light choice. We had these two people lives in our hands, and one of them was about to slip away.\n\nWe spent the next few minutes gathering information about both of these people. Anything that might help us decide.\n\nThe answer became clearer.\n\nI figured we should save the man with a family, who is well loved and respected around the town. I was, in fact, surprised to learn that my friend felt differently. He though that we should save the young travelling merchant because he "liked the way he looked".\n\nHow arbitrary.\n\nIt seemed we weren't going to reach an agreement. It seems we would have to agree to disagree and then leave it up to the flip of a coin to see who to save.\n\nBut my friend wasn't content with that.\n\nHe drew his bow and walked right up to the older man's bed and threatened to shoot unless we did things his way.\n\nI knew he wasn't bluffing.\n\nUnwilling to compromise for the sake of a merchant without a family who risked his life every time he left the town gates, I knocked my friend to the ground, thereby eliminating the immediate threat he posed.\n\nI had only a few moments to convince him to do this the fair way... But I failed.\n\nWe both knew I had superior equipment, and so I hoped that would deter my friend from attacking me. The problem was that he would do anything to get his way most times, and I knew this.\n\nAnd so we fought.\n\n"Don't make me do this!"\n"I'm not."\n"If you keep trying to kill that man, I'll have no choice!"\n"Just let him die! He's useless!"\n"Stop it! I don't want to have to waste another resurrection scroll on you, but if you die I'll be the only one to make the call!"\n"You wouldn't do that!"\n"And why not? Besides, your guy still has a chance to live! As big a chance as my guy!"\n"Ok! Ok... You have a point. We'll do it the "fair" way."\n\nRelief! I had convinced him. It was a lucky thing, too. He was on the ground, about to die.\n\nWe played a game of scissors paper rock. Honestly... I cheated. We were in the same room and I waited to hear the sound effect that indicated which option he chose. He didn't notice and I didn't tell him until the ordeal was over.\n\nAnd so the well-known, loved and respected man was the one who was healed. I could tell my friend was annoyed but his clutching his hair and saying "No!"\n\nAnd that was that.\n\nExcept it wasn't.\n\nI couldn't believe what I was seeing... The man was just about to walk out of the house when my friend shot him! He didn't die immediately, but I knew I couldn't stop him this time. Even if I killed him, I'd just be wasting a resurrection scroll... My friend wouldn't stop until the other man was dead.\n\nAnd so I said "Fine!"\n\nI drew my dagger and went to the side of the other man's bed. I thrust the dagger down once, twice, and it was over. There was blood all over the floor, and all over the bed. We looked at each other. "You monster..." I said.\n\nAnd then we burst out into laughter.\n\nTragicomedy/10","February 8","true","45.8"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","77","27","35","27","1"

So if you like those games go ahead and buy it now.\n\nGraphics... As of the beta update the graphics are awesome.. especially for a kickstar crowdfunded game based on thier own in house engine which heck how many devs just rent an engine these days.. The art and graphical style isn't as cartoonish as wow but maintains that vibrant colerfull look.. completely opposite the drab muddy look i personally hate in games. Spell effects are awesome and when you zoom all the way in its really nice with depth of field and Ambient occlusion and smaa anti alaising.. basically all the goodies one expects in a modern graphics engine. Really have no complaints in this department. (And i am a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥).\n\nCombat.. You control up to a party of 4.. 2 main char's then 2 hired char's which have backstories and can be leveled and equipped just as your main's yet if they die they are gone.. you gotta go find another to hire somewhere.. they are more than just henchmen.. they are companions. this along with summons and you can potentially be controlling 6 char's at once for a period of time during combat.. its turn based combat\nAll i can say is way to hit the nail on the head in the turn based combat.. i was never really a fan of D&D based rulesets and the drab nature of the spells and such in those games yet don't get me wrong i still loved them.\nDivinity OR gives you that great tactical turn based combad of old yet breathes new life into them with more colorfull and just plain fun array of spells and skills to use.\nYour actions during a particular turn are based off action points ... every skill requires a certain amount (which you regain them based on talents and the way you build your char every turn).. moving requires them... using items .. moving an oil barrell over to some enemies so your wizard can in turn cast a fireball and blow em to crap.. ya u can do that.. more on that later.. all based on these action points and on top of that they also have a cooldown based around so many turns.. one spell maybe u can use again in 4 turns another in 1 or 2 .. between the two systems and the amount ot skills/spells you have a ton of diversability.\nThe elements:  Every element reacts with the others... rain whether by spells or natural puts out fire and makes enemies/char's wet.. then they  can be frozen via ice spells then shattered by your meelee char's yet are more resistant to fire... fire spells can catch enemies on fire.. Rain can make puddles which can be hit with an ice spell to freeze the puddle so enemies fall.. or you can cast lightning into said puddle to stun/electrocute enemies.  Oil slicks can be ignited by fire... etc etc..\nThe combat is good enough to make you want more combat instead of dreading combat. I believe even a person who is usually turned off by turn based combat would like this.\n\nGameplay.. Everything in the world is interactable.. move things around.. destroy them.. stack them.. etc etc..\nThe loot system is great.. you have many equipable slots and find many different variety of items along your journies that all can have many substats... magical properties .. this is common in many games these days just feel good in knowing larian didn't mess it up.. its done well in this game. Nothing really new with it just done well and not broken.\nIts a quest based game yet its not WoW.. no quest markers and the such.. back to the roots with a quest log and using your brain here... your told general directions/ideas then its up to you to figure out the rest. Quest log is done very well and also you have a dialoug log and recipe log and that brings me to crafting.\nCrafting is ingenious in this game.. you just combine items in your inventory and see what you get simple as that... (there are more complex crafting later which really in the game is blacksmithing which you use an anvil and furnace and other things in the game world but its the same principle drag item from inventory to said anvil and vice versa no immersion breaking crafting menus and the such).. Example 1.. combine knife with pumpkin and you get a jackolatern which turns out to make a good temporary helmet early in game... or hammer with cooking pot for similar effect..(and you actually have in game models for all these strange combinations so you run around with a pumpkinhead) nails with branch for a basic spiked club... arrowheads with shafts which you make by combining knife with tree branch.. then mix up some poison by combining certain mushroom with empty vial then apply poision to arrowhead first then you have poison arrow so simple yet thats what makes it so great. its based on logic not some magic formula that doesn't make sense.\nDialoug is handled well also... .. there is choice and consequence but i have yet to see long term effects as we only have 25 percent of the game.\nSurrounding dialoug are the reasoning skills such as charm intimidate reason and so forth that is a dice roll based on your stats in the background which is a staple these days and nothing new yet as before rest assured larian hasn't messed it up or broken it. Now what they have done is put conversations between your two main chars (for co-op which i wont review as i've not experianced it yet but its built around a very sound principle and others seem to love it).. but you actually talk to yourself and discuss certain in game events with other main char.. seems silly but it works as you can think of them as another person in real life you know and answer for them accordingly and it effects certain background traits such as... romantic vs pragmatic and this will have an effect on these char's relationship and the story later on. there is really no right or wrong but this adds a depth to the two main char's that isn't achievable just through scripted chit chat between them like in most games. (If you don't fancy talking to yourself..you can select an A.I for your other char for these conversations but you still control them in combat)  Exploration is fantastic in this game... loot galore yet not meaningless as in diablo... such a huge map to explore just in the beta which is only 20 percent of the game..\n\nSound.. i'm not too into game music but lets just say its not bad enough for me to notice it and it blends very well with the game atmosphere.. its composed and relaxing and soothing and fits the tones of the in game events at the time. Spells have nice effects and sound stereo instead of monotone.\n\nChar Development.... Completely free and classless .. enough said lol.. Many talents to choose from along with stat point allocation and many many diverse skills/spells to learn/purchase broken up into schools... as well as warrior/ranger/rogue skills  for those that like that style of play.\nStat points are spent on the norms.. int str dex ...etc\nSkill points are spent on schools/disciplines or on personality stats such as barter/leadership .. etc or on the norms like lockpicking crafting blacksmithing... its all done very well and fits together and exactly what one who likes this  type of game would want.\nHold alt key to highlight items in game world is tied directly to the perception stat and how many points you put in it.. enough said.. the fact larian had enough sense to do this tells you alot.\n\nConclusion: They have done what i thought would never be done again with the route gaming has takn . .Simple as that. The perfect blend of exploration/old schoolness/tactical and turn based yet feels full of action/quest based gameplay i've been waiting for since the infinity engine days.","May 22, 2014","true","23.8"," 29 of 40 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","29","40","0","0"

Instead of creating an entire party of adventurers, though, you only create two (you can pick up two more pre-made companions of pretty much any configuration later on). Overall, I think the developers did a great job, and the few nitpicks I have with it will hopefully be addressed with patches or mods later on.\n\nFor me, the game's main appeals are the strategic combat and the vibrant level designs. Almost every combat was interesting--just around the time you start getting bored, you'll gain a level and some new abilities or weapons to freshen things up (as will the monsters).\n\nMy first playthrough was maddeningly difficult because I chose a rogue as my main character and, worse, tried to explore a harder part of the map before I was ready. In general, you should find areas where the monsters are the same level as your party. I find that even a single level difference will make the combat frustrating if not infuriating, with the mobs resisting pretty much anything you throw at them. Unfortunately, it's not always clear where you should or can go next, so you might need to resort to a walkthrough or quest guide occasionally to make sure you haven't missed something important. I know a lot of "hardcore" types were responsible for the lack of guidance in this game (it was Kickstarter-funded), but a bit more detail in the quest log sure wouldn't have hurt anything in my opinion.\n\nI ended up starting over with two fighter types, a wizard, and an archer, and ditched the rogue. Unlike most CRPGs, lockpicking isn't a big deal here, and any character can be trained to do thief skills anyway. I found stealthing and backstabbing to be more trouble than they were worth, and there's no dual wielding. I liked my archer much better.\n\nThe only real complaint I have is the pace of the battles. Inexplicably, there is no slider bar for ratcheting up spell animations and the like. After you've seen the same 4-second winding-up animation for the hundreth time, you may be yearning for a way to skip over them. I actually found myself getting up to refill my tea during combat, and the computer still wasn't finished taking its turn when I got back.\n\nAnother vital tip is to learn shields as soon as possible. It wasn't clear to me what these were, since they are titled something like "fire resistance shield," which makes it sound like they're just good for, well, resisting fire. To the contrary, they'll protect you from anything, but have bonues and penalties associated with the element. Another major concern are "surfaces," such as oil slicks, water puddles, blood, poison gas, and so on. These will often react quite violently to elemental effects, and can easily destroy your own characters if you aren't very careful. I found myself just taking lightning bolts and such off my quick bar, since most of the time I just stunned my own characters with them.\n\nStill, overall I enjoyed this game very much and looked forward to playing it more. It's been awhile since I had to stop playing a game because I was too sleepy, rather than too bored, to coninue. If you liked Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale back in the day, this is about as close to that experience that I've been able to find in a modern release.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EldrichDragon/recommended/230230/","EldrichDragon","Falro the Great","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EldrichDragon/","226 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n(Warning: Looong)\nFirst, some background.  Somewhere around December 20th, 2011, I discovered the Divinity series.  I was young, naive, thinking every game on Steam was a great one.  I could have easily been burned, badly.  But I wasn't.  In Divinity 2: The Dragon Knight Saga I found a true gem.  While I never got very far, and I eventually forgot about it for a while, I always knew in my heart that it was a good game.  Fast-forward some time, and I, now more wizened to the terrors of bad games, find that Divinity 2: Developer's Cut had come out.  I wanted to buy it, but to my surprise, I already had it!  The people I would soon come to know as Larian Studios had given me a free copy, just because I bought their game some time ago!  I was stunned.  Right then and there, I said to myself, "These fine people have earned a customer for life!"  Oh, but what was to come.\n\nSometime in early 2013, as I was perusing the forums as I am wont to do, I happened to glance at a post for a Kickstarter.  I had heard of KS before that; even almost purchased something.  I would've just passed it by, but something caught my eye.  As you might have figured out by now, that Kickstarter was for none other than Larian's Divinity: Original Sin.  It was then that those old memories of searching through goblin-filled tunnels and flying as a dragon came screaming back to me.  Soon it was all I could think about; how I could get money to buy it, what the process for doing so was, even possibly what the game was going to be like.  Soon, it was a done deal.  I raised a fairly healthy sum (at that point $25, just enough to get the game) and soon had myself neck-deep in chatting with the wonderful people there.  It wasn't long until I felt I wanted more.  Then, like a gift from the Game Gods, I found the Weresheep.  For a measly $6, I could join this order of super-fans!  And so, my sum kept rising and rising, eventually passing $100.  I won't disclose the full number, but it wasn't cheap!\n\nNow, with the backstory done, let's get to the actual game.  Currently, the game is in an "Alpha" state, as told by multiple warnings throughout the store page and game itself.  So obviously, there will be (and are) bugs, some game-breaking.  Also, with most update the saves become incompatible, so be prepared to start again a lot.\n\nThe game starts with a pop-up asking you to recognize that it's not finished, content may change, etc.  Once you hit the "Play" button, the game itself starts up.  The starting menu is fairly basic, and the menus (last time I checked) are placeholders from their last game, Dragon Commander.  Loading screens can be slow, and are prone to freezing (visually only; it loads after a minute or so).  But once that's all done, the game pops you, without so much as an intro cutscene, into a character creation screen.  It's fairly simple; choose your class (Which is not binding, by the way; it's very free-form) and make them pretty, then you're in.  You're immediately put in control of two characters, Roderick and Scarlett, who have a quick dialog before a box pops up telling you that you can click to walk.  And that's really it for an introduction; you're left to fend for yourself in a land which, admittedly, is not very dangerous-looking.  But the lack of controls isn't a bad thing; the game is fairly simple and the system is quick to pick up.\n\nAccording to Larian, there's a good couple of hours in right now.  I think that's pretty modest.  Depending on how you play, you can spend hours in the city alone.  This is a truly open-world game, a game I like to describe as "Go anywhere, do anything".  And no other game embodies that as much as Original Sin.  There are an infinite number of choices; if you think killing everybody and prancing on their graves while drinking a bottle of wine and smashing tomatoes with a hammer is your thing, go right ahead!\n\nTo sum it up, if Early Access isn't your thing, please, do not buy this game expecting a bug-free experience.  This game can and will break, and spectacularly so.  But if you think you can handle it, dive in, and be prepared to be amazed by the sights and sounds of Rivellon.  Speaking of sounds, by the way, those are done by none other then the great Kirill Pokrovsky, who is a musical genius.  And, thanks to the Kickstarter, he has an entire orchestra at his disposal.  Truly, this music has to be seen, er, heard, to be believed.\n\nTL,DR: Game good.  Buy.","February 24, 2014","true","30.9"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","25","37","0","1"

Combat is getting boring on easy, but normal is way to time consuming for me, because I refuse to quicksave and reload all the time.\n\nMaybe I played it wrong, maybe I should have started over at some point when fully understanding all the mechanics, I definitely wasted a few points now and then at the beginning. I probably should have exploited the random loot generation, like it is recommended by many people and I guess playing in 10h sessions during the holidays until early hours doesn´t make puzzle solving any easier.\n\nTo come to a conclusion of the above rambling: It is one of the best games of 2014 and I also respect the approach to let the player figure out everything the hard way, even if this means that guys like me who haven´t played such hardcore RPGs for a long time probably need to start over after 10-20h.\n\nWhat would have helped in my case would be a difficulty between easy and normal, where I would be able to skip a few things and have challenging battles along the main story line.\n\nVisually, the game is splendid and apart from the annoyingly jumping camera I was constantly amazed.\nEpic story and awesome writing, makes the massive amount of reading surprisingly enjoyable (the abysmal writing in most games recently infected me with the habit to skip through most dialogues and sequences, Original Sin is a welcome antidote)\n\nLooking forward to whatever follows, would crowdfund so I could annoy the heck out of the Devs during early development :)","January 16, 2015","true","60.8"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, I don't absolutely hate the game; it's just that it more than overstayed its welcome in addition to having significant flaws.\n\nFirst of all, the crafting system is just horrendous. It's extremely unintuitive and tedious. Let's say you want to create a magic scroll. You must first acquire yourself an ink pot and a quill. Good luck with that, because no vendors sell them. I ended up having to steal them from a friendly NPC. You must then combine them by dragging the icon for the quill over the icon for the ink pot, then stand by and watch a progress bar fill, in order to create an "Ink Pot & Quill". Now you have to get some pixie dust. Find a bone and grind it to dust using a mortar and pestle; oh yeah, you need one of those as well. Now find a stardust plant and throw it in the mortar and pestle to create stardust. Now combine the bonemeal and stardust to make pixie dust. Now sprinkle some pixie dust on the ink pot and quill to make "Magic Ink Pot and Quill"! Now find an axe and a log of wood. Hack up the log with the axe to get a few wood chips. Now find a bucket and search all over town for a well. Draw water from the well into the bucket. Combine the water and one pile of wood chips to make one "Mush of Wood". Now search all over town for a furnace. Throw the wood mush on the furnace; lo and behold: One sheet of paper! Now kill a dangerous Water Elemental and take its essence. Rub the water essence on the sheet of paper to make a "Blank Water Scroll". Now is the moment we've all been waiting for! Use the magic ink pot and quill on the blank water scroll to create... oh, no sorry, your crafting skill is too low. Now go kill dozens of insane demons and level up in order to increase your crafting. Great, can we craft the scroll now? As I was saying, use the magic ink pot and quill on the blank water scroll to create... wait for it... a random, low-level, one-time-use water magic scroll! You managed to do all of this without any indication in game of what you needed to do! Wasn't that worth it guys?\n\nThe loot in this game sucks. Mainly you will find more ingredients for crafting and lots and lots of vendor trash. It's hard to afford anything in the beginning, but keep picking up those garbage items and dozens of hours later you'll be swimming in gold! Which goes back to my previous point: why would you craft anything when the items you craft are inferior to the gear you will inevitably have already found by the time you figure out how to craft anything?\n\nI like that this game avoids the "follow the pointer" trend in modern video games. However, the game world is quite large and it would be nice if there was some—any—indication of where you need to go without exploring every square inch of the map. Want to know where some place is in town? Too bad you can't just ask an NPC, because they don't have that interaction programmed in. Want to delve further into your current quest objective in order to understand what it is you're trying to accomplish? Too bad, because the one relevant NPC can only tell you some generic, fluff dialogue.\n\nI could go on, but the final criticism that I want to raise is that the writing is just not compelling. It's one of the most ham-fisted and saccharine takes on the "world is ending" trope I've ever seen. It would have been nice if I could just go on adventures with some nuance and intrigue, rather than having to prevent existence from coming to an end by a contrived plot device.\n\nNot recommended.","February 8, 2015","false","114.3"," 210 of 379 people (55%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","55","210","379","45","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levyne/recommended/230230/","Levyne","Levyne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levyne/","141 products in account","This is the first of its kind for me. I've never really played a similar game. At first the fact that it's turn-based may seem like a turn-off (hehe) but that's not really the case. The turn based combat definitely does not feel slow most of the time. Sometimes the number of enemies getting turns in a row requires a little bit of wait. However, this ties in well with a mention of status effects. You quickly learn how to effectively freeze, stun, or knock-down enemies. I found I used these a LOT more than simply slowing, cursing, or lowering the attributes of an enemy force, those effects I'm sure are more necessary on hard (I played on normal) but the results are a little more subdued. The great benefit to me for the first list of statuses is that it means you don't have to wait for 5 enemy zombies to move in a row, hurray! One thing that was annoying at first but learned to avoid and appreciate later was avoiding stunning my own forces with various air/lightning spells. Sometimes I would think a unit was in the clear because she was near but not next to an enemy force but would still get stunned. I learned later on the usefulness of putting a fair number of points (and wearing appropriate gear) into the various Body Building and Willpower (or wearing armor with some form of immunity instead of just grabbing the highest armor value). Of course, this was a little easier to splurge on with the Secrets vendor exploit still in place.\n\nLater on in the game it's very easy to just buff up armor/elemental resistance and go to town and watch enemies fail to do a lot of damage. Some late game enemies were actually somewhat interesting in this regard because they rely on brute strength of a few units rather then an ambush where you have to worry about engaging on multiple fronts for a larger number of enemies. I actually had to change my strategy a bit here since I really only had 1 person able to take many hits from them and my other units (2 mages and an archer) were simply too squishy for the heavy physical damage. Luckily I had two people capable of teleporting them to where they shouldn't be to help keep things in check. The game emphasizes strategy, but it's also incredibly unbalanced, which can be a benefit but is sometimes an annoyance.\n\nThe Act 1 boss fight was the first example of the game teaching me the great value of positioning (rather than just forgoing it since it was previously not something that I needed to worry about.) Early in the game, I could more or less simply turtle, buff/debuff, and then focus fire target by target until there were no more targets left. The four foes in that boss fight just do not go down that fast, so I needed to make smart use of summons, teleporting both the enemies and myself, and really paying attention to the turn order. Seems like basic stuff but up to that point I didn't need to be as focused, and instead would just analyze what should be done as unit turns rolled instead of any long-term planning.\n\nUnfortunately, the level of that fight was never really met again until the penultimate boss fight. From the second map on, I had a pretty great rotation of summons, buffs, and engaging that I really didn't need to deviate from. Most of the mid game boss fights I didn't even need to worry about whatever the mechanic was for the fight. King SPOILER had an interesting elemental mechanic but was long dead before I even had to worry about it. Maybe I should have played the game on hard, but in act one Normal seemed like a great balance. I probably should have switched but in the middle of progressing through the game the ease of combat first feels empowering instead of boring. I guess that's what second playthroughs are for SOMEDAY\n\nThe last part of the game really dragged on for me and soured me a little bit. I was traversing the last area and would actually loathe seeing red dot enemy blobs since they were just wasting time. I suppose a consequence of the long run time of the game itself as well as the rote-ness that encounters had become by that point. The only interesting encounters in that area involved the a certain goblin enemy type since they were so tanky and I couldn't just take them out quickly. So instead I would wipe out all their friends and then just peg them down slowly or less slowly, far past to point of them being an actual threat. I really enjoyed the encounters around Cyseal and Hunter's Edge because the battles felt meaningful and paced between quest progression. The red dots in that final area and to a lesser extent, Hiberheim, it just felt like I was a cartographer scraping the edges of the map and clearing it out just for a sense of completion.\n\nOne of my gripes with the combat system, as as been mentioned by others, is that sometimes it's easy to "miss" a target if his idle animation moves him out from underneath your cursor and you end up walking up to give him a hug rather than attack. I wonder if a toggle for a snappy cursor would be a possible implementation. Sometimes you can click on the enemy portrait or zoom and wiggle the camera but a lot of times there are many enemies of the same time and you're unsure which portrait is his, and for me moving the camera can sometimes mess with my mental map.\n\nThe pet talking talent is super useful, and putting it on one of my source hunters was the only real piece of advice I went into the game with. I see a lot of talk about people restarting to try to perfect their characters while I just went with a long laundry list of imperfections that made the game somewhat interesting. It will be interesting enough to see people speed run (fewest turns possible) some of the bosses (assuming at the same level) to see what sort of truly overpowered builds people can create.\n\nI only wish the game threw a couple more talents your way. Some of them seems crazy useful (Leech) while others seemed like a somewhat waste of points.\n\nI didn't really like most of the indoor dungeons, I liked the encounters in the outside areas a lot more, generally (not in the phantom forest). The indoor areas mostly just felt like corridors filled with baddies or rooms filled with switches. The pixel hunt puzzles were so very grating. The area near where you fight a story boss in a library is especially memorable, as well as hidden buttons in the Dark Cove and the last dungeon. I didn't like the last set of puzzles much at all, until the very last part, which was nice but too easy. A hard thing to balance, surely. Either the solution seems a little obtuse or it's spelled out and feel like it's wasting your time. While I say I didn't really like them, it was still more interesting than finding a switch tucked away somewhere.\n\nNot really a puzzle but something I'm reminded of are the reason/charm/intimidate skill checks. I really don't like the rock paper scissors implementation at all.\n\nI never really found the need or desire to save scum for loot. I guess mainly because the crafting/upgrading of equipment is easy enough, and the importance skills and tactics is MUCH more important than whatever you are wearing. I recall not replacing Jahan's initial staff until he was level ~14 and I realized my Scarlett had a level 5 cap and boots until very near the end of the game. You could beat the game naked. If they fix the issues with the low level loot dropping from higher level areas, then I really don't have much of any problem with it. It doesn't bug me that I might have an old piece of equipment stick around since since I never happened to find a replacement. You make due with what you get.\n\nThe artstyle and whole tone of the game is definitely pleasant. The exuberant and over-acted mannerisms of some of the npcs definitely set the tone of the game early on. The environments are great, and the music is fitting, and areas like the Temple of SPOILER are haunting as they should be. Sometimes the character models don't look super when zoomed close, but that's minor.","July 15, 2014","true","74.5"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","0"

To say that this game, which even in Early Access looked amazingly promising, has come a long way in its development by Larian Studios would be an extreme understatement.\n\nAt the beginning, you get to develop two characters that will be your primary PCs for your trip through quite an extensive world. Even in just the beta a large chunk of the world was available, now that the full release is finally here, that world is much, much larger now. You can mix and match your starting skills to create anything you might want, from caster, melee, ranged, as well as other things such as making your mage a suave charismatic leader, or your rogue a pickpocket and thief who then turns around and sells the items back to their owners for even more than they are truly worth. Creation of your characters alone can take some time, as the possibilities are near endless.\n\nStarting off, the game has obviously had a lot of work put into it. There is a nice tutorial dungeon that does a good job explaining the basics of combat and miscellaneous actions, such as how to deal with traps, pressure plates, locked objects (I love how you can just destroy them if you don't feel like trying to pick the lock, or simply don't have a key) and even then, that's only some of the important mechanics of the game. Your dialogue interactions greatly influence your skills, as you develop traits based on your decisions which can influence combat and social skills by a small amount.\n\nGot a friend? Larian has developed a drop in / drop out style of co-op that one can play. Two PCs, two players, you and your friend can create and control one character each, or they can simply drop in and take control of your second PC. It definitely is an interesting system for co-op, and jumping into a game is extremely simple between friends.\n\nEven though it says about 25 hours played for the beta, I probably spent close to 50 while in offline mode, and even with all of that time, it still is amazing. Looking forward myself to playing through the entire world now, and I hope that if you purchase this, you'll see just why this game has such amazing potential and enjoyment to be had.","June 30, 2014","true","51.5"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

I gave him a talent that let him heal when standing in blood. My mage used her nifty new staff of air. It does electric damage. I can electrify a whole pool of water and stun enemies. This time, I zapped an enemy standing in a pool of blood and my swordsman got stunned too.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin will end up GOTY for many. It has an impressive level of detail. You get a detailed combat system, but one that doesn't suffer from mind-numbing menus. Or you can show off your cooking skills to the other party members anywhere you can find or make an open fire. Crafting is intuitive, just drag and drop anything that looks plausible. A stick makes a feeble weapon, but mine are destined to become poison arrows.\n\nEverything moves along rather speedily. Point, click, and a few convenient keyboard commands. The key commands are reconfigurable. The only thing I could find to improve is the inventory system, but that is already better than the competition. And, you can invite people, or let your Steam friends or anyone else auto-join your game - when that happens, inventory management speeds up as you both pick up and pore through your loot after an adventure. You can also adventure separately and, outside the very early game, teleport immediately to rejoin. (I have not tested the multiplayer.) And there is a lot of loot. You might not deign to pick up every apple you find just to make more apple pies, but there are plenty of enchanted and rare items to make you happy. At Normal difficulty you will hardly use any of your consumable items as long as you play carefully.\n\nThe starting city has vendors in every item category and magic school. And you can boost some deluxe early equipment if you don't mind being shady. Want extra experience? Perhaps there are some guards you don't like whom you can catch alone in a manageable number. They are quick to get in a scrap anyway. Honestly. I didn't even ctrl-click to attack them. Or sometimes I just made an oopsie and someone got slowed and set on fire. If anyone asks questions later, I just blame it on the undead.\n\nThe music is appropriate and there is plenty of it. Even after dozens of hours you will enter an area and experience what seems like a new mood from the music. Or the music can remind you that you have a bit too much experience setting off traps. You have the option to play with from 2 to 4 characters. You create 2 and the rest volunteer or are hired. There's a well-crafted tutorial. It's totally skippable, but once you've seen it once you might not skip it. You can run through the tutorial area in 10 minutes for some easy starting loot and a splash of experience.\n\nAnd there are modding tools. So you can expect to revisit this game some year for quite a new experience.\n","August 4, 2014","true","238.1"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"

The story takes place in a fantasy world, Rivellon, like the rest of the franchise. The two main protagonists are source hunters, but there is more to them than meets the eye. And little do they know of the importance of a quest they must undertake that will affect the world. Like in all grand epics the source hunters start off with a routine murder case, and what they discover that day will change them.\n\n\n\nThe story in Divinity Original Sin is one full of twists and turns that will not disappoint. This game has a plethora of colorful characters/villains that will make you both laugh and cry. Your companions (if you choose to have them), have plenty of well thought out backgrounds. Their sidequests tie well with their stories and are entertaining. The game may have a few misspellings here and there but has plenty of depth worthy of your attention.\n\n\n\nThe graphics and art of Divinity Original Sin are top notch. You are also hit with enjoyable music that sets the tone on your adventures. When you start playing, you are immediately immersed by the beauty of this world. It is a welcomed sight to have so many well placed details in this game. But don't take my word for it, let us "Rock-paper-scissors" it.\n\n\n\nThe difficulty of this game is to my liking. There will be plenty of quicksaves and quickloads that will go throughout your many battles. There are puzzles that you will spend hours on and will say, "Oh, that's where the switch was the whole time." Yes people, using different fields of view will be your best friend on this journey. In Fact lest I forget, the game also encourages using the field to your advantage during battles.\n\n\nThis is one gem that I would recommend to friends and family alike. I hope the people in the steam community who haven't played this game or have just given up on it, will give Divinity Original Sin the chance it rightly deserves. This game will not lead you by the hand, and you will appreciate it all the more for solving/winning the game under your own power.\n\n\n\nHappy gaming.","May 3","true","99.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Back then, you see we bought software in boxes and drove home with them. Backwards; i know. Nontheless, I came across an interesting box, for cheap: Divine Divinity.\n\nDivine Divinity. Like, Wet Water, or Dirty Dirt, the name was sure akward, but it was friday and was less than 5 bucks.\n\nTurns out I ended up loving that game. It remined me of Arkanum, another relatively unknown and awesome title from the era. I continued to follow this, at the time, relatively unknown game company's Divinity series. Through Divinity II, Eco Draconis and so on.\n\nThese games are all, at their core, well balanced and artfulyl constructed rpg's that don't deviate far from the genre. They incorporate humor judiciously in the games, giving the game a quirky, 4th wall breaking feel from time to time. Most importantly, they are jsut quite fun, all of them.\n\nSo here is the latest one. From the looks of it, a quite successful game for the company. Truthfully, there are things I preferred about previous games, butt his one certainly deserves its place in the series.\n\nSinply put, this is a solidly crafted isometric rpg that remined me very much of the first time I played Divine Divinity. I even recognise some of the musical tracks from the first game in this game's excellent soundtrack. Very cool for an old fan!\n\nIf you know how to play a game like this, it is of reasonable difficulty. Save often. If the game seems like everythign is too difficult, you're in the wrong place. I did feel like a few of the 'puzzles' were a bit too 'chancey' in their resolution. *possible spoiler* I can easily see a perfectly astute player never finding the White Witch, due to the mere trickle of information provided on what to do next (and how to do it).\n\nDespite any clunkiness, I still resommend the game.

The crafting system is fun and intuitive, and some of the puzzles are very well done.\n\nFor all the praise, however, I also have to mention the downsides. And there are definitely those:\n\nThe balance, in general, could use an overhaul. The game has a pretty steep learning curve in the beginning, but once you know the system, the fights are actually very, very simple. Note that I say simple, not easy.\nThe fights, especially boss fights, tend to be long, repetitive, tedious, and, yes, even boring. The enemies usually have a TON of hitpoints, unlimited special abilities and everyone and their mothers, - of the same level or a bit higher than the party - is pretty much immune to special abilities - and thus, most tactical choices. They do, however, do pretty pathetic amounts of damage while keeping your party stunned, crippled, knocked down, frozen and generally annoyed but alive.\nI would highly prefer shorter, more challenging battles against enemies that are actually affected by all the special arrows I can craft and all those abilities - foes  that are much faster to kill or disable but a lot more likely to kill ME.\n\nThe numbers/RPG mechanics are yet another problem. Larian follows the old JRPG-style of insane number exaggeration. You start with a weapon that does 10 damage and you'll end with some monstrous obscentiy that can easily exceed 1000 damage on a critical hit or with a special maneuver. Enemies hitpoints and resistances grow accordingly, and the interesting enemies are thus always within about 2 levels of yours. Higher enemies are pretty much untouchable, lower ones pathetically helpless.\n\nAnd, finally, many quests and puzzles are just too damn obscure. I commend Larian to go against the mainstream, and skip all the quest markers, map markers, signs above a quest giver's head etc. But sometimes they fall to the other extreme and there is simply no way to continue with a quest but to randomly walk evereywhere, try everything and finally check the internet, only to learn that you missed some random item 4 hours ago... ;-P\nMore logic and sensible hints, please!\n\nBut this is all just criticizing on a VERY high level, and it doesn't diminish the fun at all. And, hands down, you won't get a better deal for your money anywhere atm.","August 5, 2014","true","204.0"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

I don't like games where merchant NPCs have a set amount of money. It's realistic I guess but I end up having to bounce between multiple people all over the city to sell all the junk I get and it gets tiring so I end up not picking up junk loot and now I don't have money.\n\nThe entire inventory system is a mess to look at and having to move items between party members to inspect or repair is kind of a pain.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zer0das/recommended/230230/","zer0das","zer0das","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zer0das/","245 products in account","Divinity: Original Sin is a mixed bag. There are plenty of positive reviews out there. I personally enjoyed the game enough to beat it, but I will be focusing on the negative.  The main reason for this is there are many mechanics in the game that are frustrating as a player and I think people should at least be aware of these issues. And if RPGs already aren't your cup of tea, these issues are probably enough to make it unenjoyable.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin goes out of its way to be misleading, time wasting, and obtuse. If you're someone who enjoys not looking at a wiki when playing a game, you'll be hard pressed to do that with this game. I'll begin with a list of scenarios that have happened to me and then go into more depth. This may come across as nitpicky, but the more you play the game the more you realize scenarios like this are fairly common.\n\nIn one particular boss fight, I struggled for 2 minutes trying to align my mouse perfectly so I could actually hit the boss. The hitbox of enemies doesn't match the actual sprite, sometimes it is much smaller. This is a problem when the screen gets cluttered and you have multiple people wailing away at a boss. Sprites also move in an "idle" animation while the game is waiting for you to make your moves, causing the tiny hit box to move around while you're trying to click. If you click at the wrong moment (very easy to do), well you just moved your character, perhaps took a reaction attack from the opponent, moved through poison or fire, and now you can perform fewer actions as you move back to your original spot to try again. Eventually, I figured out the hitbox was essentially a 2x2 grid (almost down to the pixel) centered on the persons head, but it required so much precision I got so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off trying to stab this boss, I just simply reloaded the game and waited for them to move out of the bush before starting combat. You can rotate the camera or press "b" to do a top down mode, but sometimes this doesn't help either (though top down works ~99% of the time, but it took about 60 hours and a friend to find out this particular camera angle usually works).\n\nI decided to do a temple of trials for a particular quest line. Halfway through I realized the opponents in the temple are too strong for me to deal with at my current level. But there's a certain set of switch puzzles that took an infuriating amount of time. The game leads you to believe that if you try enough pots, barrels, and boxes the switches will open- but no, you can only use activate two of the switches with those. You need a very precise weight to trigger all the switches. That's okay, if I hadn't tried about 100 pots/barrels/boxes before looking at a Wiki to realize the game was just screwing with me at this point. Now you usually can leave areas without any real penalties, but my party contracted rot- which is essentially incurable by normal means and requires a rare item and ticks down your health by 1 health per turn until its cured (to a minimum of 1 health). Now you can use a rare item later in the dungeon, but considering I had to  reenter the temple and reaquire rot to finish the quest later, I decided not to. But this required me to run around the game for 5 hours until I found the relatively rare item to cure the condition (and it only happened because my friend happened to tell me where two were that I missed). In the meantime I had to heal my party about every minute so the rot didn't chunk my health.\n\nThere's a perception stat that helps you see hidden things, along with making you have a higher crit percent. If only it actually helped you be more perceptive against enemies.  I was derping around a cave and sort of knew some enemies were coming up, so I casted increased sight. Shame it didn't matter, the invisible enemies lurking in the bushes don't trigger until you trigger an enemy in broad sight further up no matter how perceptive your character is. They also can't be hit until they move once. So if you took the main route and kept your party close, you're now horribly flanked regardless of what statistical and personal decisions you made. Your only option is to reload the game and keep your party further back and then agro with a ranged weapon. Why not reward the player for actually planning instead of running semi-scripted battles and reward reloading the game because now you know how its scripted? It feels like most of the challenge from ordinary fights is from these scripted events given where I'm at in the game, and not the actual fight itself.\n\nOther major complaints:\n\n1. Nearly every fight in the first map involves fire and/or poison. Contracting one of these twice is enough to kill a party member early without healing, and if they come into contact with each other they explode.  The end result is you spend a disprorptionate amount of time running away to remove poison/fire early in the game. There aren't any real countermeasures available early, at least not ones you can afford/waste skill points on. It's nice in small doses, but it seems like the later in the game it gets the more prone my screen is getting coated with hazards from magic spells. If I had a rain spell I could just clear it, but I don't (party choices- too late to turn back, and I can't find a skill book).\n\n2. Vendor randomness severely limits your spell and equipment choices. You don't learn spells/skills like a typical RPG where you level up and learn them- you need skill books. Which would be fine, except vendor loadouts change when you level, and if something isn't there, it isn't there. There are some presets or high probability skill books that are almost always there, but the rarer stuff is hard to get. Later in the game there's more vendors which helps alleviate this problem, but you can go through the game and not know a spell even exists until a boss smashes you with it. Some people would argue this increases the replayability of the game, but if I don't read a wiki I don't even know what I'm missing. There's also not an awful lot of choice in the early game, because what you have often comes down to what drops/spawns in dungeons.  Isn't this typically when characters start to differentiate? Leveling didn't feel particularly rewarding as a result.\n\n3, The AI is extremely hit or miss. If you reload a game and play a fight, sooner or later the enemies do really derpy things. An example is my friend ignited an oil barrel which caused a plume of smoke around the boss. The boss sat still and burned to death because it couldn't see outside the cloud and the skeletons refused to cross the fire. A boss just sits there while eating projetiles and spells because it can't see? Another fight later has a boss that can summon a quasi-AOE fire spell that can do like 300 damage. Turns out the best way to beat him is to reload until the boss sits around ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ its turns on other stuff and just pray to your deity he doesn't ever use it. I can't help but feel something is being lost when that's the extent of the AI and how I'm using the save/load system.\n\n4. I feel like for being a fairly open game, it goes out of its way to force me down a certain path, Which would be fine, but having to wander around until you find monsters that are about your level and just reloading/running away when you don't feels ham fisted. Enemy level spikes don't feel natural, and often I'm unsure where to go becaues its possible to have 10+ concurent quests fairly easily. The game really doesn't prime the player enough by having difficult but barely possible fights to let them know it might be a bad idea to keep wandering down this road.\n\nI could go on, but I'm running out of space.

This game was partially funded via Kickstarter, and is a sequel to Divine Divinity (which if I'm being honest I have never heard of, or played). This game was released on 30th June 2014 for PC and Mac. I played this entire game on Steam with my husband using the co-operative multiplayer mode.\n\nThe customizable protagonists of the game are known as Source Hunters. In single-player the player controls them both, while in the co-operative multiplayer each player takes control over one of them. Gameplay begins in a town called Cyseal in southern Rivellon, and the Source Hunters receive orders to investigate the murder of a town councilor. The plot goes on a journey to investigate cults, relationships, sacrifice, and more.\n\nThis game ships with the editor that it was created with, and this allows players to create their own single-player and multiplayer adventures, and then publish them online.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin is a 3D, isometic, party based, turn based, choice and consequence, strategy RPG. You will need to make optimal use of action points, skills, spells, equipment, and objects within the environment to get the most out of your experience.\n\nThere are 11 preset classes to choose from at the start of the game, however each can be customised to suit your own personal style of play.\n\nThere are 6 attributes to select which are common throughout any RPG genre, such as strength, dexterity, intelligence, etc.\nThere are 6 abilities to choose from which are weapons (i.e. single-handed, two-handed, etc), defence (i.e. armour specialist, shield specialist, etc.), skills (i.e. expert marksman, pyrokinetic, witchcraft, etc.), personality (i.e. bartering, leadership, etc.), craftsmanship (i.e. blacksmithing, crafting, etc.), and nasty deeds (i.e. lockpicking, etc.).\nThere are 45 possible talents to choose from, some of which unlock as your character gets stronger and makes specific choices throughout the game. Examples of talents are gaining additional ability points, damage boosts, immunity from spells, increased spell range, etc.\nThere are 9 different skills that you can take, and you can either have spells in each skill, or you can specialise in specific skills. Examples of skills are Expert Marksman for rangers, Man-At-Arms for melee combat, etc.\nMy husband played as the Battlemage, and I played as a Cleric. We used supporting NPC's Madora and Jahan. I felt as though it took me a little time to really get into the combat, but our four characters complimented each other well. My husband and Jahan (specialising in Hydrosophist and Aerotheurge skills) were the casters; I was a single-handed, shield bearing tank (specialising in Man-At-Arms and Hydrosophist skills); and Madora was a two-handed damage dealing tank.\n\nParty relationships feature heavily throughout the game, for example if you damage one of the NPC's in your party whilst trying to attack an enemy they can get angry and leave the party; likewise when playing co-operative multiplayer there are specific dialogues that take place between the two 'real' players that affect their in-game relationship.\n\nThe game plays out in real-time, and only the battles are turn-based and are dependent on Action Points that your character has. The number of Action Points you can use in combat is dependent on your attributes and abilities. These stats can also be affected by your gear. Combat can be influenced heavily by elements within the game, i.e. if one of your characters casts a fireball at enemies, and then poison is cast over the top of the fire, this can generate an explosion; likewise if a fireball is cast at an enemy and it then begins to rain, this can generate a steam cloud; water can be electrified by using lightning which can stun enemies (and friendly characters). All of these combinations lead to a higher level of strategy needed to finish off some of the stronger enemies that you come across.\n\nThere is an entire crafting and blacksmithing element to this game, however as we were not actively role-playing throughout the game, we didn't actually find these abilities particularly useful. I had my NPC put a couple of points into crafting and blacksmithing so we could repair gear in an emergency if we were unable to teleport back to a town, but we never found any need to make potions, make our own armour, or use any food available throughout the game. Early on in the game we did use health potions a fair bit, but once all four of our characters were able to use a healing spell, they eventually became redundant too.\n\nAs well as the main story in the game, there are also over 70 other side quests available. Side quests can be the best way in which to find new armour and weapons, as well as getting valuable experience to further improve your characters attributes.\n\nI did find parts of this game frustrating as the combat at times can go on forever in a big fight, you can at times get insta-killed by lava when you weren't expecting it, and we also found a few glitches here are there where we had a the game crash completely, or quests that didn't quite work as they should causing us to have to reload. Despite these issues this didn't detract from my overall enjoyment of the game, though I would definitely recommend auto-saving on a regular basis.\n\nHaving played the entire game using the co-operative multiplayer, our total play time came to just over 80hrs (each) logged on Steam. This game is most certainly excellent value for money, although I do think that we could have finished the game a little quicker than we did as we did miss some important quests early on which meant leveling up took us a bit longer than it should, but overall that was all part of the experience, and we would know better if we ever decide to do a second play through.\n\nFor any fans of Diablo, Torchlight, Titan Quest, etc., I urge you to get a copy of Divinity: Original Sin. It is excellent value for money, and is a great strategy RPG with a well thought out, well explained story, with excellent longevity and replayability.","May 8","true","80.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

For the early release, buyer's beware. See laundry list of issues below (I am submitting feedback here, I cant be asked to create a larian forum account to submit feedback, sorry devs), I am not mentioning known issues or unfinished areas as they go without saying.\n\nLikes:\n- Controlling 2 characters with different personalities; when they argue with each other it feels schizophrenic.\n- The elements interacting with each other and the environment is great.\n- Game is stable, had no crashes. Just one lockup into a dialogue that I couldn't exit, no biggie.\n\nThings that need/will/should be fixed:\n- I saw an Orc attacking his shaman, I guess the latter got caught in an AoE cast by the former. It was hilarious, actually maybe this is working as intended, they are after all Orcs.\n- Almost all of the inhabitants have a comment when asked about that crime committed in town, "Esme did it, she is guilty as sin". Was fun when Esme herself had that comment.\n- Attacking NPCs... We murdered some 5 guards in town. No one seems to care. No witnesses, but still... somebody should react to that.\n- Attacking main NPCs... When approaching a certain main NPC weapons in hand confronting him... He literally disappeared in a puff of smoke. Was hoping the game would deal with it a bit better.\n- Balance. Seems ranged + magic is much more powerful than melee. I have won battles 3 (level 3) vs 10 (level 5+) by environment & AoE spells,  summoned creatures tanking and ranged weapons,... that is great, but my main characters actually had more talent/skill points in melee combat, going into melee was very painful not to mention degraded weapon and armour.\n- Need killing blow to gain XP; XP denial by allied NPC. Seems it is better to let the NPCs die or kill stealing from them, than actually fighting with them as allies.\n- I have characters skilled in gear repair and lock-picking,... no idea if they are not implemented or I just haven't found out how to used them or am missing an item to do it (lockpick ? Repair tool ?)\n- Piles of gold in inventory. So I usually get a bit of gold for every transaction with an NPC. Problem is I now have 10 piles of gold cluttering my inventory, couldn't find a way to consolidate them into a single one.\n- When attacking if you miss-click you can end up healing an enemy or attacking an ally. I don't mind that in principle, but maybe get a warning "Are you sure you want to do that ?" would be helpful. Especially since with the isometric view, it is sometimes hard to target a crab behind a character when only a wiggly leg appears behind her. The most hilarious thing was my character *shield bashing herself* instead of the crab.","January 20, 2014","true","87.6"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","0"

Yes, there are definitely fun parts, but the game is riddled with bugs (some of them game-breaking), flaky behavior, and bad design choices. It feels like the first 10 hours were made with loving care and then it gets progressively more and more rushed until a the end it's nothing but fight after fight with treasure and XPs being shoveled at you so you'll hurry up and get to the end of the leveling treadmill.\n\nWe experienced a game-breaking bug at the end of the game which wouldn't allow us to get into the Source Temple (the crystal that opens the door was a bugged non-object that we couldn't use and wasn't recognized by the game). I took notes during the game, here's my thoughts. As you can see, there are way more negatives than positives. Overall, I don't feel I could recommend this game.\n\n+ Great visuals. Seriously, the artwork is fantastic. A little cartoony at times, and textures are inconsistent, but the volume of eye candy more than makes up for any visual shortcomings.\n+ Game doesn't level-scale, meaning if you level up and come back to an area that was previously too hard, you will have an easier time of it. It really gives you a sense of gaining power.\n+ Has co-op! And the co-op actually works pretty well. It was so nice to be able to play this with my wife.\n\n- Some undead can be poisoned. But practically no other enemies in the game can be. I eventually stopped using poison arrows because everything was either immune to it or worse, healed from it.\n- When resurrected, character sometimes comes back in T-pose and stays that way until exiting (no animations, just glides around in T-pose).\n- Constant falling down if you're on an ice patch. Even high bodybuilding doesn't seem to help. On the contrary, enemies almost never fall down on ice.\n- Debug draw rays are frequently visible on characters controlled by your co-op partner when casting spells.\n- Running water (like creeks) isn't treated as water (doesn't make creatures in it wet, electricity and other clouds dissipate on it immediately).\n- Shooting a stunning cloud arrow on a wet area won't make it electrified, only a stunning arrow will work.\n- Enemies seem to have an incredibly high level of immunity/resistance to everything (specialty arrows like poison/charm/knockdown are pretty useless past the early levels)\n- Initial story is interesting (murder mystery) but quickly changes to a convoluted "save the world because fabric of time is unravelling with demons and ice prisons and blood stones and dimensional rifts" mess that's impossible to make sense of.\n- Crafting system is tedious and can mostly be skipped. It feels very tacked on. There's no crafting bench which would help with the UI and recipes. Instead, you have to find and drag things around in your inventory and whether it works or not is a baffling trial-and-error process (two small healing potions can be combined into a larger one, but two medium potions can't?). You can find books that hint on how to craft things, but unless you enjoy paperwork/memorization, you'll do like everyone else and look them up online, which means you'll spend half of your crafting time outside the game.\n- Enemy AI is very flaky. Enemies tend to get stuck a lot or skip their turns. It's as if they disregard viable-but-dangerous options in their behavior trees (like walking through a fire area even though they have high resistance to fire), and it leaves them in a stuck state where they do nothing and eventually pass their turn. All the while you get to sit there and wonder if you game is frozen.\n- Enemy AI will also sometimes be stupid and run off - probably trying to take a long convoluted path to get to you - and you have to chase them down because otherwise you're stuck in combat while they run all over the map like an idiot.\n- Sometimes you "succumb to death" without knowing what killed you. I had to look up this one area online to find out why I kept dying for no reason. A little extra explanation of what happened would help sometimes.\n- My enjoyment of the game was inversely proportional to the length of time I played.\n- Save scumming is required, and even encouraged by the game. You'll die a lot, or your game will become bugged, and you'll have to reload and replay stuff over and over until you figure out the perfect order in which to do things or how to keep your characters from stepping in the wrong spot.\n- Pixel-hunting for tiny switches on walls or floors is required. A lot. We had to come back to many areas we couldn't finish after looking them up online only to find there was a small hidden switch somewhere. Main quest lines should not require pixel hunting to finish. That kind of stuff is fine for side-quests or extra loot opportunities.\n- Too much dependency on levels. If you are two levels below your enemies (especially early on), they are nearly impossible to defeat. However, if you are one level over your enemies, they are trivial to defeat.\n- Smoke doesn't seem to affect enemies' line of sight. They can target you even in the thickest smoke areas - ones you can only move through because you can't target anything past your face. This has the side effect of making smokescreen arrows completely useless. I mainly noticed this after level 10 or so, it seemed like before then smokescreens would help sometimes.\n- My game would crash to desktop when exiting about 80% of the time.\n- Enemy "idle" animations are way too exaggerated. Elementals look like they're practically disco dancing when they're supposed to be idle. This has the side effect of making them hard to attack, since you have to click on them while they're dancing around. And if you mis-click, you get to have fun watching your character walk over to them, sucking up attacks of opportunity and walking through fire/poison along the way. You can hit "B" to go into an extreme top-down mode for combat targeting, but really this wouldn't be necessary if the idle animations had been toned down.\n- The game trains you to trust certain things and then pulls the rug out from under you at random times. For instance, there is one place that has mounds of dirt that if you dig them, explode for 32,000 points of damage, killing you and anyone around it instantly. Why do these dirt mounds explode? Who knows! Just reload and don't dig there next time.\n- It's extremely easy to accidentally double-click the End Turn button, which if your characters are right next to each other in initiative order will skip the following character's turn.\n- Maps with tons of dangerous fire areas are just annoying, because your party pathfinding AI will not avoid cutting through lava areas and getting insta-killed.\n- If you drink an armor potion (and probably any potion that "casts" a spell on you) while muted, you won't get the benefits of the potion while muted. It's as if the game treats potions as spells, which don't work while being muted.","March 6, 2015","false","89.4"," 234 of 438 people (53%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","53","234","438","32","7"

I just finished the game last night after putting approx 215 total hours into playing it solo. I play taking my time and searching for secrets and sidequests and reading all the text for all Npcs. So my view of the game might differ from someone who likes to get through games faster, only worrying about major quests.\n\nOverview of the plot: The two main characters you start with are source hunters which are sent out to investigate the murder of a town councilor. You quickly discover there is much more going on and uncover a massive plot. Along the way you find a few characters which you can bring into your party to help. You can have 4 party members total not counting temporary summons. Each party member has there own story and motivations for joining which you eventually can learn more about. You eventually learn more about yourselves and your role in the past that is gradually reveled to you as you progress through the game.\n\n\nPROS:\nCombat is fun and doesn't get to repetitive. There are many different skills you can learn and characters are not tied to one "class". Elements can be used together to achieve various results in combat along with environmental effects. Fire and poison create explosions, water or blood on the ground can be frozen to make enemies fall, water on the ground can be electrified to stun anything standing in it, etc. There are many possibilities with combat that helps keep fights fresh.\nThere are hidden side quests and loot that gives a reason to explore.\nThe dialog and writing are great, there are some interesting and witty moments that make you smile.\nThe areas and environments look great.\nSome quests have multiple choices and outcomes. Its nice to have choices and different ways to complete a quest.\nTurn based combat that lets you use tactics and strategy.\nCo-op support. Although I didn't like playing it co-op so I played solo I'm sure there are plenty that would rather play with a friend. I like that it gives you a choice and you can play solo or co-op without the game giving an advantage to one over the other.\nCONS:\nThe crafting system is frustrating and you will find yourself never using it. Good luck figuring out what can be crafted or even how to craft anything without looking it up online. Yah there are a few recipe books you can find in the world but there only cover a tiny fraction of crafting and they are usually cryptic and don't help much. If you want to figure out any other recipes on your own without looking them up on the internet be prepared to just keep dragging random items on top of each other for hours in your inventory randomly hoping something happens... I like games that don't hold your hand sometimes and make you figure things out but this crafting system is not a good example of that at all. Its just a bad design for a crafting system.\nthere isn't enough reason to spend gold. Its easy to amass a hoard of gold by mid game but there really isn't much to use it on. Its fairly easy to get gold selling junk you find and paintings or gold forks you find around. I ended the game with almost 200k just on one character alone.\nAt the end of the game I was still using level 10 ish boots and shoulders on my mage. Finding mage gear other than just the robe was almost impossible. Maybe that was just my luck but I think the balance of gear dropped for each class should be looked at\n","September 25, 2015","true","215.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","10","14","2","1"

Unlike recent RPG-called titles from this century —mostly made for the new generations of players, with little or no brains needed at all to solve quests—, Divinity: Original Sin looks like a true role playing game reminiscent of the old ages but with very cool new ideas —some of them unique— and fresh graphics.\n\nThe main characteristic, typical of Larian games, is the freedom to do almost everything you want: the game is classless, so you can choose a warrior in the beginning and later on you can change your mind and provide him with some spells or range skills, if you like it, when he level up; this way you will end up with four characters, two of them from the start and two more later on, with a combination of skills, traits and talents that fits you. You can interact with almost every item in the game: doors, chests, barrels, pictures, chairs, etc, and you can open them to look inside or destroy them if you prefer, or even take them and move them from one place to another. You can also choose if you prefer to talk to every NPC and solve quests, trade with them, or killing them if you like it, or even steal their items and loot their houses. Every action will make the villagers approach you in different ways, turning hostile to you or being polite instead. And if you don't like to trade with NPCs a lot you are able to craft your own gear and even spells if you choose to do it with the immense amount of ingredients and tools you will find everywhere.\n\nWhat makes this game unique, and a gem, is a combination of the role playing part with the interaction between characters —even yours!— and its combat system. Divinity is not a combat focused game, it is more a conversational and exploration RPG title; however, combat is also very important and this is not a real time one, it is a turn-based combat system with action points mechanics that forces you to think about your resources, the enemies, and the environment; so each turn you can use your points to move, drink potions, attack or cast spells if you got enough points for them, or if you prefer you can reserve some of your remaining action points for your next turn, for example if you want to wait when the enemy is far away from you and later on you want to hit him two or three times in the same turn. The best part of the system is, no doubt, the chance —and mostly the need— of using the elements on your favour. It means you can cast a rain spell on your characters to stop them from burning; you can also cast rain on enemies, make them wet and then cast electricity spells for extra damage and stuns. You can also use ice spells if enemies are wet —state than come from your spells or from real rain itself!— to freeze them. You can shoot (after throwing it for example) an oil barrel with a fire spell to make it explode and damage the area, or just hit it with your arrows to make it pour the oil and later on cast fire on it if you wish. You can make an ice barrier to protect, wait until enemies are near it and then fire it, making it water and causing enemies to stumble, and then electrify them. You can combine elements to create clouds to avoid being a target. You can stealth and stab enemies too if you have the right character to do such a thing. You can use barrels and things of the environment to take cover, to protect you and to avoid damage. You can also try to flee if you find the situation too chaotic for your taste. You can... well, you can —and you should— do all these things if you want to survive, because combat is not always an easy task on this game.\n\nFor all these things I must say this is a heck of a game; I have not THAT fun with a videogame probably since some decades (I'm absolutely for real here). It's also true that there are some things that are not optimal and need improvement. Among the negatives, there is the camera movement, the slow pace of the game sometimes when you need to go from A to B, and the bad interfaz mechanics when you need to equip gear, change items from character to character, sell something or look at the items you got, or pick them. This is not a noob-friendly game; aside from the little dungeon tutorial at the start, you will find little or no help at all and you will find lost yourself if you are not used to RPGs games. However, asking in the forums will help you; there will be trolls, true, but overall the community will end up answering your questions and solving some of your starting problems, I'm pretty sure.\n\nBut if I take all these things together and put them all in a balance, I have to recommend this game to every player in the world. If you are an oldschool gamer you just can't pass on this. And if you are a new player and you didn't play or didn't even know any of the games other guys are mention, you have to give this one a chance and compare it yourself with the new RPGs. I promise you won't be disappointed.","July 13, 2014","true","119.5"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","1"

The music is top notch and fits the game perfectly. The combat (turn-based) is just heaps of fun, with all the different spells and skills available to use. The strategic combos of elemental magic never gets old.\n\nIn the end I played almost 90 hours and didn’t encounter a single bug or glitch, which is quite a feat considering the scope of this game.

If you're an old school RPG player, however, you'll immediately be drawn back into your childhood--of the times spent discovering Fallout 2's world and Baldur's Gate. Even if you spent time with the Final Fantasy series and other JRPGs, you'll still be reminded heavily of the past.\n\nBoth western and Japanese RPGs are genres that suffered as we moved into millennium. They lost their purpose and games evolved, leaving them behind. It takes games like Divinity: Original Sin to remind us of what a RPG really is. Its combat is old school and turn-based, its loot similarly complex, and its storyline muddied and epic in every sense of the word. It plays like a 1990's game through and through, of a RPG that has entirely too much crammed into its tiny world.\n\nExcept, well, this world isn't so tiny. In a modern age, the designers can fit as much as they want. In result, they've managed to make a modern CRPG while keeping the vintage feeling. Cyseal is stuffed full of side quests, treasure, friends, and foes. It feels almost alive, bustling with NPCs and activities to do. Every barrel has an ingredient for something you don't know how to make just yet, every area has a few NPCs you don't know their purpose of, and it's easy to get lost. But you won't mind it that much. A graveyard has a secret tunnel that takes you to a few chests and some enemies; cellars can have great riches or just cobwebs; and you can explore so many areas in so many ways.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's an experience and it's mostly an amazing one. I truly recommend it. There are frustrating moments, confusing game design choices, a few annoying bugs, and, as with every CRPG, the game is unfriendly to new players. But it's not unfriendly without a purpose. It's unfriendly to try to inspire nostalgia which it successfully does, paying homage to an entire decade of gaming. For an indie studio to accomplish this via Kickstarter and to accomplish it so well is nothing short of a miracle.\n\nNow please excuse me. If you'll need me, I'll be off sneaking somewhere--probably opening a few chests and stealing a few paintings from the inn.  It's nothing personal, dear mayor. I just rolled a character who was heartless.","July 6, 2014","true","56.7"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","2"

It's everything you have ever wanted a multiplayer RPG to be. The conversation options and the asymmetrical dialog (Players each have independent dialog options) make for a really engaging experience where you truly feel like you're roleplaying in a way reminiscent of games from awhile back. I'd say they don't make them like they used to, but Larian's proved that wrong with Divinity: Original Sin.\n\nThere's a lot of customization available, and while the game in screenshots resembles Diablo or Torchlight with their 3d Isometric views, this is not a hack and slash game - enemy encounters pause the action and pop up action bars, with movement and action point costs. Combat is turn-based, and it feels and plays and looks fantastic.\n\nThis game is labelled as early access but it is indeed basically done. I've been following the production since Kickstarter, and the actual Launch day is in a couple days at the end of June. If you're looking for a great RPG to play with someone else, with lots of engaging gameplay and the ability to create watercooler moments (few things are as  fun as when you both have different ideas for how you should act/treat an NPC and you just do your own thing), look no further.\n\nAlso a full suite of modding/content creation tools, so if you don't like the game you were given, use the engine to make your own RPG.\n\nIf Steam doesn't sell this game in a 2-pack, they really should.","June 24, 2014","true","5.4"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

Many turn to Dragon Age are the defacto "king",\nbut that is a choice made from a lack of competition. To say that Divinity:\nOriginal Sin is satisfying, is to say "ice is cold". You just know it as fact.\nEven those early playthroughs where you just mess up badly, but you\ndiscover some hidden scene that would not otherwise have been seen.\n\nThere is a caveat, though. This isn't a console style 5 hour tutorial-style\ngame. While you aren't thrown into death itself like Dark Souls, you are\nnot told what to do, and how to do it every second. It respects the fact\nyou have a memory and some intellect and that we enjoy challenge.\nThe graphics are quite lush, despite not being a graphics-focused game,\nyou won't ever find yourself being unimpressed or let down. It really\ndoes feel and come across as a work of passion, of love. The devs had\nput much of themselves into this game.\n\nIf you are a fan of RPGs, or of Larian, you owe it to yourself to play this\ngame. Not since Ultima 7 has a game really captured that feel of a really\ninteractive world. Oh, and do yourself a favour, choose the Pet Pal talent\non your first playthrough (because there will be more, trust me).","July 13, 2014","true","42.0"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","2"

Your closest friend, the one that you trust the most in life; your platonic life-partner. The Bill to your Ted. Starsky to your Hutch. Simon to your Garfunkel. This is the man who you would leave your children to in a sudden passing. The best man of your wedding. The one person in this world that you can rely on moreso than anyone else.\n\nIf you play Divinity: Original Sin with this person, they are also now officially Hitler.\n\nYou have created the modern day Hitler. Congratulations.\n\n"But Thalarios, that's an incredibly offensive thing to say."\n\nWell ambigious voice, I'll give it to you that it's a bold claim. But let me tell you why you've resurrected the late Führer from the depths of Hell, and I'll do so in 250 words or less.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin is a single and multiplayer fantasy roleplaying game brought to be by the powers of Kickstarter. It puts you and a friend in the world of Rivellon to combat evil magicks and fight goblins and orcs and whatever other fantasy creatures they decide to throw at you. Skeletons probably. But what you didn't realize is that this game was brought to you by M. Night ♥♥♥♥ing Shamaylan because, plot twist, your real enemy is the godfather of your children, Hitler.\n\nAre you going to play a melee hero? Your friend will obviously play a ranged hero, of course. And if you go ranged, they'll go melee. "To balance out the party" they'll say. "It'll be more fun this way." And you'll agree to this, because you are innocent to their true nature. I guess you never took Social Studies. Maybe you were too busy getting handies behind the football stadium from Victoria Blangfield.\n\nAnd in the first couple fights, you'll laugh with him and say "Wow this turn-based combat is interesting! Did you see that explosive barrel you shot did damage to me?"\n\n"Yeah." He'll say. "Yeah ain't that something."\n\n"We better be careful about that stuff!" You'll trail off, too busy taking in the ambience of the game.\n\nHe won't reply.\n\nYou'll fight a few more encounters, and you'll laugh nervously as you get caught in his charges, or as his flame arrows ignite the ground you walk upon. Maybe he's just learning. I mean you're only level 1.\n\nFlash forward.\n\nYou're level 5, enclosed by skeletons on every side. The claps of thunder above are the only thing that keep you awake through the pain and constant downpour of rain. But you know with your next turn you can finish the skeletons off. One mighty bladestorm is all it'll take.\n\nYou look at the iniative at the top of the screen.\n\nHitler is next.\n\n"Hey man, hold your action until after I use my bladestorm. You can pick off any that are left," you pause for a laugh, "If there are any!"\n\nThere's a moment of silence before he speaks.\n\n"I'm going to use my electric arrow to crowd control them all." he says.\n\n"What? No, don't do it man." You're unsure if he's joking or not. "You're gonna CC me! It's raining, the electric will CC me!"\n\nHe doesn't say anything. You see his character charging up the shot.\n\n"Come on man just let me do it!" You're reduced to pleading now. Pathetic, shameless pleading.  "We'll just finish this fight and then we can save so I can go grab those tickets to see Maroon 5 before they're sold out. The show's gonna be so sick bro!"\n\nToo bad Adam Levine was born after World War 2. He let's the electric arrow loose. Every single skeleton resists his stun.\n\nIt's your turn now. Oh wait, Hitler just crowd controlled you. The skeletons beat on you until nothing's left but a bloodied pile of armor and regret. It's Hitler's turn. Oh look, another electric arrow. You haven't said a word since his last turn.\n\nStun fails again. He dies to the skeletons. Fade to black. Reload screen. Silence.\n\n"I'll catch you later man, gonna hit the sack. Same time tomorrow?" he says and before you can answer he logs out.\n\nYou drive 45 minutes to get the tickets. They're sold out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","October 2, 2014","true","20.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","6","7","4","0"

I find it generally fun, but there are a lot of issues with the game surrounding lack of information given to the player either int he manual or during game play about how the game actually works.\n\nPros -\n+ Free-form character development: there are no classes so you can design a character however you want. But this can also be a con, see below.\n\n+ Immersive world with an interesting backstory and good motivations for your characters\n\n+ Ability to RP the characters in the actual game, not just in local chat, by using conversation options even among your own part members.\n\n+ Complete control over the NPCs - there is no need to live with idiot AI to charge stupidly into battle and cause a team wipe. You also control what skills and abilities they take as they level up.\n\n+ Graphics and sound are good\n\n+ Open world that lets you do just about anything within reason.  You won't see a lot of 'you can't do that' messages from the game, which is nice.\n\nCons -\n- Lack of *useful* information for the player detracts from the freeform character design. For example, I had to discover online that higher skill ranks cost more to purchase, and would not simply unlock as level went up. There is no indiation of this anywhere in game nor in the game manual. The manual is also very vauge on things like how points you will have to invest, what the max level is, etc. You can easily nerf your own character due to this lack of information.\n\n- Prices at the vendors are psychotically insane given what you find while adventuring.  The only way to stay 'on par' (with what the game seems to expect you to have) is to steal everyone blind and sell them back their own stuff. This utterly wrecks immersion unless you have a party full of kleptos.  Not to mention stealing is stupidly easy to do and not get caught, so the claim in the game manual, that stealing leads to a rep hit, is patently false unless you're dumb enough to steal right in front of the NPCs.\n\n- Way too many quests make their way into your journal before you can finish even one that you are working on, so this game is like Skyrim in that it suffers from massive quest spam. Also, several quests are really about the same thing, which just clutters up the journal.\n\n- Speaking of quests, many of the quest entries are utterly useless because they are too vauge, things like 'You noticed something interesting about the door in Jon's house.' Oh THAT is going to help me next week when I get back to investigating this quest.\n\n- In what appears to be a misguided effort to make the game seem hardcore, without actually being hardcore, it is way too easy to die and way to easy to rez in this game. Death is meaningless if you can just resurrect people.\n\n- The economy is completely broken. This is related to the stealing.  You have to steal people blind because you need money, but stealing them blind gives you more than you need, so you are walking around swishing huge bags of gold by level 4. The designers clearly realized this so they made things expensive and forced you to die and buy res scrolls (see above) to help drain some gold. Which they only needed to do because they made stealing so profitable in the first place.\n\nOn the whole I think the flaws are serious but not game-breaking.  I am giving this game a very weak thumbs-up. I don't regret buying it, and I am having fun playing with a friend co-op because I have not been able to play a paper RPG with him for many years and this lets us relive the good-old days. But I have to admit if this game were solo, I'd probably have stopped playing it after a few hours because of all the issues, especially the broken economy.","August 2, 2015","true","121.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

It strikes a very good balance between old school cRPG and modern design. It has plenty of text, quests, exploration, and discovery while including many of the usability improvements we've come to expect these days.\n\nThe combat system is probably the best I've ever played in a game like this. I've been on the fence of the Turn Based vs Real Time with Pause argument but this game makes a hell of a case for turn based gameplay. The elemental combinations and environmental interactions are exceptionally executed and allow for tactics I've never experienced in a game before.\n\nAs of this review I'm at 82 hours played on my second playthrough and still enjoy it tremendously. I absolutely cannot wait to see what mods we'll get for it.\n\nIt's not perfect (which game is?) but it's damn good. At the rate they've been updating the game (every few days) I expect Divinity: Original Sin to settle in nicely with the greats of the cRPG genre.\n\nBut, it's not for everyone. While the moment to moment writing is generally excellent the whimsical tone may turn people off and the overall plot rather bland. I've seen complaints from people accustomed to modern game handholding - it's true the game does not slap down objective markers and tell you where to go at all times. You need to talk to NPCs and pay attention to quest details.

Its mindblowing. It is everything a true RPG fan could want, depth, story, tactics, customization. So many modern RPGs are dumbed down, basically a siries of "go here, do this" fetch, kill the whatzit, ect quests with little minimap icons to point you along the way.\n\n\nNot Divinity: Original Sin.  Its challenging. It makes you think, use tactics and your environment in combat, and also to get hidden bits of story. If you just wade in to battle, expect to get pulverized.\n\nIts for the die hard RPG fan. Casual players or people who expect to always win and not talk to people and go places just for more plot are not going to like this. People who want a modern take on the great RPGs of the late 90s are going to think their dreams came true with this one.\n\nI know I did.\n\nAs far as the co-op goes, its a cool feature and I suppose some people like it, but I could have totally done without it. Really. RPGs are single player in my world. Fortunately, you can choose a "personality" for the char youre not playing, or just pick the dialogue yourself.

I let my Friend lead. It was going swimingly, we'd explored a beach, found a giant talking clam and fed it, and then had ended up at the town gates. I said i'd take the lead as I had more perception and I could see which way to lead the conversation, this seemed like a good idea as the two guards were completely trollied.\n\nOh dear is all I can say. They ended up dead, and we ended up with a cheesewheel and a cook book. I have no idea how it ended up like this. My Friend was laughing so hard at the outcome that I thought he was going to wet himself. Literally.\nWe got into the town and everything seemed to be back on track, we were making headway with the quest and we'd racked up a bit of money. Now it was time to interview a suspect, seeing how it went last time with my attempt, I didn't volunteer. It was going great until my Friend killed the guy.\n\n"He had information we needed, why the f%&* did you kill him?"\n"He was annoying me and not telling the truth."\n"So we go out and find more evidence, then come back and talk to him again."\n"Nah this was easier, plus we can loot the place now."\n\nMy Character was too moral and didn't want to loot, so I left to talk to more people in the town. I thought I had another lead until my Friend asked if I could bail him out of Jail. He tried to sell the looted items, got caught, tried to fight the Police, failed and was in Jail. I  didn't have enough gold to bail him out so we had to restart from the previous save point. Oops!\n\nPros:\nThe most unique part of this game is the fact that you can change the outcome of the storyline and quests by what you say in conversations or by what you chose to say. Sometimes, this works wonders and you can make a shy person open up to you with important information or you can calm down an angry drunk to avoid a fight.\n\nThe dialogue is hilarious, each little joke, each innuendo just made it for me. I especially loved the animal to human dialogue.\n\nYou can do almost anything you want! You can murder people, you can steal from people, you can wander around aimlessly. You can even use your partner as a distraction and go into places you aren't allowed in.\n\nThe combat system is neat. I found it easy to understand (especially considering this was my first attempt at this genre) and I was actually pretty decent at it. I could combine attacks to create terrain that would cause effect damage to enemies when they entered it. This made it easier to defeat enemies higher levels than us.\n\nThe asthetics of the game are beautiful too, I felt genuinely immersed in every area I went into and I really appreciate the level of detail that went into it. In every field, you can see tones of the green/yellow grass depending on which way the sun is in the games sky. You can see shadows in the water which are fish or other objects.\n\nCons:\nIt was a lot of trial and error. I think we restarted the save a few dozen times as we'd managed to ruin it and promptly fail our quest.\n\nI'm putting the combat system here too, because you do have to plan out your moves accordingly. I had to think about 3 steps ahead to ensure I could defeat the enemies, or I had to run.","March 28","true","7.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Every new area has the potential of putting you in yet another highly amusing event and wandering around the colorful world of Rivellon is certain to be entertaining. There are definitely a lot of tiny annoyances (co-op dialogue is clunky, the game poorly hints at which direction you should go, the main story isn't immensely interesting and more companions would be great) but these are all just tiny issues in what is otherwise a fantastic RPG that allows you to interact with a highly engaging world in creative and clever ways.

Don't expect quest markers to point out where you need to go, you actually need to read stuff, refer to your journal, and figure it out yourself.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Elgalad/recommended/230230/","Elgalad","Elgalad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Elgalad/","1258 products in account","Quick Impressions (3 hours in):\n\nThis game is incredibly polished compared to most other games I've played recently.  It was developed on Kickstarter and the extra time and support the fan base's commitment to the developers has been Well rewarded with this creation.\n\nI've played through the tutorial 'dungeon' and starting area, and got a pretty good feel for the mechanics, combat, and overall feel of the game.  If this game is as large as I've read it is, and if the detail and entertainment value hold up as highly as the first few hours have, this is going to be an instant classic.\n\nLet's start off with what I liked most:\n\nGraphics.   I have a pretty powerful pc, but have still had a few hitches on some recent games.  Not a single one on D:OS.  With the graphics cranked up to ultra the game is absolutely beautiful.  With spell effects and weather effects going off, everything runs smooth as silk, not a single stutter or slowdown.  The level of detail is very good, terrain, textures, animation, all excellent.  And the Attention to detail is also obvious.  You'll see exactly what I mean the first time you attempt to 'sneak' with one of your characters, LOL.\n\nSound.  Captivating musical score, excellent voice acting that actually sounds professionally produced and directed!   I've read elsewhere that not all interactions are voice-acted, but given how large a game this promises to be, I'm willing to forgive that.   The environmental ambient sounds add well to immersion.  Combat sounds are also good; solid and realistic.\n\nCombat.  This is turn-based and right up my alley.  I've always preferred using tactics during combat and enjoy having the freedom to plan out my moves, rather than engaging in a mindless clickfest or spamming hotkeys until they cooldown.  While games like Diablo and Path of Exile have their merits,  it's refresing to discover that true turn based tactical combat models are still alive and kicking.\n\nCharacter Development.  There are more classes to choose from starting out than most other rpgs offer, and one quickly discovers that these are really just starting templates,  as you have the option to fully customize any character into exactly the model you desire.  Some combinations will work better than others and discovering these can be a lot of fun.  In any case, many recent rpgs (especially mmos) have fallen into the trap of trying to 'balance' every character class, which only results in classes that are merely clones with minor asthetical differences.\n\nInventory and Crafting.  It's clear even from the start that there will be a Ton of options and items to collect and create while one travels through this game.  And it's also quite refreshing to play a game that doesn't throw too much 'uber' at you at once.   I compare this to Diablo 3, a game I really do enjoy, but whose loot system still feels broken and overpowered well after the lauded expansion.\n\n\nAnd a few things I Did find fault with:\n\nThe User Interface is good for the most part, pretty standard fare, as you can see from the screenshots on the store page.  Menus and popups aren't difficult to navigate, but I did have some trouble with inventory management.  Nothing severe, just some issues with moving items from one character to another, finding particular books and recipes, that sort of thing.  It may just take some getting used to, but I was hoping for something a little more streamlined.\n\nCamera controls:  Movement is acceptable, being basically a left click to move the selected character.   My main complaint is with the camera rotation.  Unless I'm missing something, it appears that the player is locked into a 90 degree arc that limits the actual ability to 'look around'.  The camera will only shift from Northwest to Northeast.  With occlusion in the dungeons and behind walls, this gets to be a little annoying.  Occluding terrain will turn transparent to show your your characters but objects and interactible characters can still be hidden sometimes until you move to and rotate the camera just right.  I have to wonder why they didn't just go with 360 rotation..\n\nThose minor concerns aside, I still Highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys CRPGs.  The pluses far outweigh the negatives and the price is absolutely right ($40 is a Bargain for a quality game these days!).  If you'd like to engage in some good old school fantasy roleplaying that channels the pen & paper spirit of Baldur's Gate, mixes in some epic gameplay ala Diablo 3 and tops it all off with the high level tactical combat of XCOM and Jagged Alliance, do yourself a favor and buy this game.","July 5, 2014","true","5.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","2"

After 12 hours, I have to conclude that, surprisingly, it seems to have the correct amount of parts in the right places. The graphics are pretty, UI is practical, gameplay is smooth and the story is coherent (at least so far). Despite that, nowadays even a good single player game where you have to spent hours just going around talking to NPCs and get excited over it is usually not enough to deter most people from playing their Counter Strikes, Dotas or what have you instead. Luckily, unless the developers consider split personality disorder fun, the game is intended to be played in co-op, which dramatically changes the experience for the better, although it takes time getting used to reading the dialogues in the chat log or having your friend retell them to you. There are a few other flaws like: long loading times, weird choice of music for some encounters, not enough ways to customize the look of your character, stealing and breaking in almost always goes unpunished unless you're doing it in plain sight etc. It's really not that big of a deal, especially  considering that the game supports modding and the developers are actively patching it as well. If you have a good friend willing to spend his precious time exploring the intricacies of Rivellon with you, I'd strongly recommend buying it. If you're a lonely nerd longing for a proper RPG game, pick it up and you won't be disappointed. Otherwise, keep playing Dota.","July 16, 2014","true","23.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","2"

I had been looking into buying it since it became available on Early Access, but held off. After it went into beta, I honestly couldn't help myself. It looked way too good to ignore any longer and glitches and frustrations would have to be taken in stride. I needed a role playing game with only customizable characters. I got that and the ability to give my characters a personality. It really is an enjoyable game, even in the beta form.\nThe game sports a delightfully colorful cartoonish look while maintaining a fair grip on reality. The colors themselves feel sort of like pastels. Overall, the style of it looks wonderful in motion. Every area also in the game feels unique enough to where you'll be able to comfortably play without relying on the map. Even the darker areas of the game such as burning forests and dripping coves feel consistent with the rest of the game's appearance. Character models kind of look like clay, but don't look terrible because of it. Instead, they blend rather well with the world. Spells are flashy and when they hit, they make a noticeable impact. Animations all feel smooth. Each spell class (Earth, Fire, Water, Air, and Witchcraft) all have a similar base, but different overall presentation.\n\nThe combat is turn based, but flows fairly fast. Attacks don't take a lot of time to execute and given the tactical nature of skills, battles can end in an instant. Some of the more drawn out battles come from larger groups of enemies, rather than smaller groups of tougher combatants. A lot of effort was noticeably put into enemy placement. This was done to make each battle not only feel unique, but keep players on their toes. There are conveniently placed barrels of oil and water throughout the world and using them to your advantage is nearly vital to survival. Elements play a major role in combat as things like electrified water can stun enemies and iced ground can cause a player to slip. Their effects can be null if your character rolls a high enough saving throw based on your stats. You can also remove hazards from the field through the same use of elements. Fire will melt ice and explode poisonous clouds, while water from rain will douse fires.\nThe number of actions you can take during a turn in battle depends on how many actions points your character has. Everything from casting spells to equipping items and simply moving consumes action points. This ensures that the player thinks about every choice they make for everything that they do. The enemy AI isn't too stupid to walk directly into a fire pit and will generally go after squishier party members before others. They also incorporate tactics of their own will use the environment to their advantage as well if they are able. Unfortunately, melee enemies have a tendency to mob from time to time which makes dispatching them a little easier than normal. Leveling can be a bit of a pain, but isn't too tiresome. Grinding, however, is out since enemies do not respawn as there are a set number of them in the game. There are two side notes I would like to make about the game's difficulty. One, the game does have a difficulty setting that I haven't used myself yet. And two, I'm basing this analysis on multiple play-throughs with only a party of two. There are two companions available in the current build of the game a mage and warrior and there will likely be more when the game releases officially.\n\n\nWhat skills a character can learn are based on the number of points put into that particular school. There are eight different classes to choose from. They are simply warrior, air, water fire, earth, witchcraft, ranger and rogue. The first level in a class allows for you to learn three skills in that class and from there it gradually increases with each until you get to level five where you can learn an unlimited number of for that particular class. There are no limits as to what combinations you make with these classes. However, there is a level limit attached to skills as well which makes it that much harder to strike a balance with more specific role playing characters you make. It should also be noted that physical based characters feel really underpowered compared to mages.\nThe character creater comes with eleven pre-made classes. They all range from your standard to pre-built hybrid classes. What weapons you start with are based on the class you choose before further editing it. So if you want to make a warrior-mage that starts with armor and a sword, you would first have to choose either the knight or fighter class, then edit the skills to liking from there. Cosmetically speaking, the game offers up numerous customization options that allow to make your character your own. There are a dozen different skin tones, hair styles, and faces available. Everything seems well made and a finished character actually looks like it belongs in the game it came from unlike some character creator results.\n\nThe story, or what little of it that has been made available in the beta, feels straight forward, tight and fun. The story follows your two created characters traveling to the town of Cyseal to investigate a murder. You are to find evidence of Sourcery and eliminate it with extreme prejudice. Or you could just meander about and until the actual plot comes in. The reason for your characters journey is just a means to an end. What becomes increasingly clear as you move forward with the game's plot is that your characters much more than the mere mortals that they start off to be and they'll learn as much about their past selves as you do as the game moves forward. Your characters can grow to love are hate each other based on the personalities that you give them. Things can even entirely platonic between your characters if that is what you want.\nThe way this works is that there are instances where your characters can communicate with one another and from there, you can choose their responses to one another. These events can be triggered by any number of things such one character fleeing from battle or even something simple like finding a note on the beach. The dialogue flows pretty naturally and the game manages quite a consistent tone. The amount of consistency is pretty remarkable considering the pretty diverse cast of characters available even in this starting portion of the game. The writing is delightfully humorous, and even when more dark discussions are had, they are treated with a light sense of whimsy. This doesn't mean that everything is a joke, just that the game doesn't want to take itself too seriously.\n\n\n-You'll notice that this review doesn't talk about the online portions of the game. That's because I don't play games online and that even extends to this. I'm not against it, personally, and think that the idea of how it works seems nice enough. I can speak briefly of the global chat: It works. That's about all there is to it. If you have a quick question about something in the game then you can drop it in the chat and people will respond to it. The people are decent for an online community and are pretty helpful too.\n\n-The game has bugs to be sure, but every major bug in the two plus months I've been playing the game has been addressed and a ton of smaller fixes are always implemented with each release. The most nagging past issues have been: broken traps, dumb enemies, various graphical glitches, and a few story related makers and queues being "off" The game has never crashed on me even while in beta.","June 12, 2014","true","255.4"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

When I first started following this game, I was put off by the amount of dialog that seemed to be present.\nThat is not an issue.\nThe dialog, while verbose, is broken up into easily read portions. Conversations are handled in logical ways. I have yet to run across any dialog that I wanted to "skip through". All of the dialog has added something to my experience, just as it should in a quality RPG.\nThe shear amount of things to do is incredible. I usually play my RPGs as a “good” guy; You know the type. I won’t steal, trespass, or try to break the game’s progress. Divinity WANTS you to do those things! Once I let go of my lawful tendencies, the game opened up on a whole new level.\nSneak into a house and rob in blind? Check.\nBust open a shop door? Check.\nMurder an NPC for her possessions? Check.\nDig up a grave or three for lofty loot? Check.\nIn fact, had I not done at least a bit of this the game would have been much harder so far. This speaks truths to some aspects of real life experience as well. Not that I have ever done anything like that listed of course, but its possible out here, and possible in Divinity too.\nThen there is the lovely, turn based, tactical combat. Personally, I haven’t seen enough combat! This system is enjoyable enough that I think it could be a game unto itself. Rain on a fire based enemy, zap it with a water based spell, and cause massive bonus damage, just as logic would dictate. Fire and lava on the map will actually heal those fire-based dudes, too. Nothing feels quite so bad as when that badass sword swinging melee fighter runs off, steps in lava, and heals for 3000 points (When he only has 150 HP to begin with!). Knowing you have to kill this thing in one turn so it can’t heal really puts the pressure on.\nOpposite to that, catch on oil slick on fire. The fire will spread all over and enemies enveloped by it act accordingly, sometimes casting rain spells of their own to counter. Of course, casting rain now makes then wet, and they can be more easily frozen. I love this system, and many combinations exist. Poison arrow bombs. Electricity streaming through a newly created rain puddle. Teleport that bad dude into a lava flow for virtually instant death. SO MANY OPTIONS!\nExploration. The game is HUGE! I have about 25 hours in and have not completed the first area yet (I am told 100 hours for a first playthrough is not unreasonable). I am only at level 6 with my characters, too. I have found a way to “skip” past a lot of the content in the first area, but the next map harbors enemies that start at level 9. So, while possible, it’s not advised. The game does not put up an artificial barrier to block your progress (Or hasn’t so far). In the first town I was warned by the city guards that I was not strong enough but they would still open the gates for me, leaving the choice up to me.\nThe game will require some thinking outside of the box. Some of the boss fights you will face can be brutally hard. But with the proper application of strategy and using the tools at your disposal, all fights seem fair. Nowhere did I feel I had been cheated, either in battle or in the puzzles. And if you do feel so, the quick save and quick load function can be used anywhere.\nSo, tl;dr? If you even remotely liked Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment, this game will scratch that same itch.\n","September 24, 2014","true","32.2"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenicianson/recommended/230230/","phoenicianson","PhoenicianSon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenicianson/","47 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMany ask now-a-days, "where have all the good [RPG] games gone, and where are all the [developer] gods?  Where's that [Playable] Streetwise Hercules to fight the rising odds?", and ain't it all too true?  Gone are the golden days of the old school RPG's that made the genre the gods of Olympus in the world of video games: Fallout, Neverwinter, Wasteland, all genre defining titles.  Where have they gone? Well, they have been replaced with fast paced  3D, in your face, Action RPGs, that look pretty with their special effects and complex skill trees, but lack the depth of the, "choose your own adventure in an open world", style of PRG gameplay that everyone grew up on, and grew to love.  Well, the wait is over!\n\nDivinity seeks to place the genre back on Mt. Olympus with its phenomenal engineered throw back to the old school era of RPGs, but with its own, unique, "new school flavor"; all wrapped in a pretty bow - as in the interactable world and environment built around it.  Dvinity plays just like the "oldies, but goodies", yet with a refreshing approach implementing new elements to modernize the dead genre while breathing new life into the RPG's of old.\n\nDespite bridging the gaps by filling in the missing components of the early century Golden Age of "bird's eye view RPG's", Divinity reaches beyond the limitations of the earler "industry defining" releases in the open world RPG genre. Divinity offers an unpredented depth to character development by offering a plethora of archtypes, styles of play, and even so far as each character's personality through an AI setting to be available at release.  The "AI" setting is your characters disposition, which I look forward to experiencing the impact it will have with NPC interactions, and the game play as a whole.  Divinity makes the world around the player character come alive and cooexist with the player character's choices offering a synergy unlike what you have seen before in an open world, "choose your own adventure", RPG's.\n\nCombat is of course turn based, and strategic to say the least; in many situations, survival is contingent on using the environment to garner an edge against your enemies through spells and or skills.  Spells, certain weaponry - particularly arrows bought or crafted by Rangers- as well as skillsets also help the player navigate and negotiate dangerous environmental restrictions such as, poisonous areas, grounds scorched by fire, or frozen over by ice, and environmentally hastened, strengthened, and even weakened, enemies.  Only by negating or taking advantage of these effects can your characters safely gain passage whether they are navigating through dangerous environments, or fighting certain combatants requiring the player to use thought and purpose to progress through the game.\n\nYou start with two fully customizable characters based on existing archetypes, or you can build their skill sets and spell pools to your own style of gameplay.  During your trevails, you will be introduced to companions who will join your crusade with their own personal disposition towards your actions and inactions with ongoing interactions with your player characters as the game progresses.  Your chacters themselves will also interact through dialogue to support one another's choices or to contradict eachother using skills gained during gameplay through these interactions.\n\nDivinity Original Sin offers a deeply enriched environment.  The backstory is that the player characters are "Source Hunters", or investigators that quell threats of people using an evil form of necromancy magic called, the "Source".  It all begins with the investigation into a murder at Cyseal, requiring the player character to interact with several NPC's to unravel the mystery until their investigation leads to fruition with answers to satisfy the residents of Cyseal.\n\nQuests, in general, are multilayered requring the player to embrace thought and consideration into the process of unravelling the mysteries to find the answers their quest-givers seek.  These quests are not arms length transactions like the RPG's of old: find this, get that, kill that, come back.  Rather, quests are integrated into the fabric of the game.  Some of them require not one, two, or even three steps, but an inumerable chain of steps to achieve your ultimate goals.  This provides a sense of unity and singular purpose in discovering the solutions whereby what you decide to do in one quest, may ultimately affect the results of another or multiple quest chains.  This offers a very unique experience to RPG players both old and new.  Players generally have to interact with most of the NPCs in order to decipher what needs to be done to complete each quest, while certain quests still maintain a simple and direct passage offering diversity.  The several quests that are connected to the main quest never ends.  Once you have completed the chain in one area, it spills over to the next area, and I assume so on and so forth - I only assume because the beta ends with completing the main quest in the first area, as the following areas are currently locked out of Beta.  All the while, quest completion feels organic and intuitive so te storyline doesn't feel disconnectedl.\n\nTo advance the experience further, Divinity DNA includes crafting sourced from genre defining games like the Ultima series.  You can craft an innumerable number of items, from clothing to weapons, potions to scrolls, magic items to non-magical items, all based on your crafting skills, the recipe books you have uncovered, and the simple purity of trial and error by mixing various ingredients to learn new compounds.  The crafting component offers a whole layer to the game that can keep you entertained for hours, if only to learn more combinations to create items, potions, weapons, and then twice over by mixing crafted items with crafted maigcal items to create magical properties within crafted items.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin is truly the RPG, with old school blood, of this decade, perhaps the century.  If you are a purist when it comes to "top down, open world" RPG's, you will not be disappointed with the depth, novelty, and versatility of this game.  Not only does the game offer a core storyline for you to playthrough, but upon full release, players will have the opportunity to create their own environments, NPCs, characters and quests of their own to upload to developer servers for others to play.  These tools offer the level of depth that most online games with similar tools could only dream of providing to their player base.\n\nYou would probably expect that I would be wrapping up this review, but there's more. The game can be played single player. One of the more defining characteristics of this game is the opportunity to have one player character controlled by a second person.  You can play with a friend and divide and conquer, performing whatever actions you choose free from the other player and all across the environment.\n\nAlthough the game is only in Beta stage, the total time to complete this area will keep you engaged for up to 25 hours, or longer, depending upon how many rocks you turn over to find what you are looking for while completing your quests.  I can only imagine what the final release will hold with a multitude of additional areas to play through.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rhyper/recommended/230230/","rhyper","Rhyper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rhyper/","263 products in account","When I bought this game I did not expect to enjoy it too much, "It's just a turn-based RPG" is what I thought. It's not "just" that, not at all.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin starts of with a simple task, which is to investigate a murder, and so you start off your journey in this amazing world. Quickly you'll notice that things might not be what they look like, 'the plot thickens', and you will realize that the simple task you started with is now part of something much, much bigger.\n\nYou are free to do as you please, didn't like how this guy treated you? Might as well kill him. Too bad he had some information  which could help you solve some quest, but no need to worry as you might stumble upon a clue as you move on. But you will face the consequences of your actions, if you dig the grave of a mourning woman's husband to find some loot, she will go crazy and attack you (Personal experience).\n\nThis game also won't take you for dumb, from questing to combat, and even on dialogues, you'll have to put your brain to work. Quests require you to to really pay attention to whatever clues you find so you can get them done, and don't you dare look for a walkthrough! During combat you'll have to consider what kinds of enemies you are up against, what kind of enviroment are you in, is there something that you can use to your advantage? Like that barrel of water sitting next to your enemies, how about destroying it with a fireball and then throwing a lightning bolt to stun your foes, or maybe turning it into ice to make them stumble and fall.\n\nOverall this game was an awesome experience, and absolutely one of the best RPGs I've ever played, I definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for a new, refreshing experience, especially those into heavily story-driven games.\n\n9/10","August 28, 2014","true","89.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cosmicengine/recommended/230230/","cosmicengine","Cosmic Engine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cosmicengine/","309 products in account","Video Review here - http://youtu.be/HAPUACQ_F9I\n\nOnce again we go back to Rivellon with all its intriguing secrets and equally wacky wonders. Indeed it doesn’t seem that long ago since I was flying around as a dragon with a jet pack, wooing undead princesses and trying to take over the world. This time however we return to Rivellon in a more traditional sense in the form of a top down isometric RPG. Traditional not being a bad thing mind you, as Larian have taken every old school mechanic which they have then spruced up with some modern day flavour and some Larian magic to boot.\n\nGraphically Original Sin is a treat, the graphical fidelity of the game is both beautiful and stable. Everything from spell effects to the detail on rock faces is great to look at. One complaint I do have is the character models, I certainly think they could have been done to a higher standard. That being said of course one thing that did stand out was the character animations especially during combat. Spell animations  in-particular are a favourite of mine, its rare to find a RPG with spell animations that look and feel authentic. When you cast a bolt of lighting it really does look, sound and feel like your character is harnessing the power of the lighting through their body and unleashing out onto an unfortunate foe.\n\nSpeaking of things sounding right both sound effects and the musical score hit the mark. The games soundtrack in-particular is a fantastic listen, something that the divinity series has become known for over the years and original sin once again brings forth a great orchestral score. While we are on the subject of sound something that was a huge disappointment for me was that the games dialogue is not fully voiced. Certain portions of the game are voiced and for the most part are done to a listen-able standard but I certainly feel that it was a big misstep for the title.\n\nLets move on to what is in my opinion not only the foundation of the game but also its shining feature, the combat. Over the years I have grown very weary of the traditional way of designing isometric RPG's, that being they all have real time Diablo style combat. Point and click combat has become very repetitive and it's something I feel now hinders the genre more than it helps. Thankfully thanks the the re-emergence of games like X-Com, tactical turn based combat is back in a major way and the turn based combat in Original Sin is nothing short of brilliant.\n\nMovement, attacking, spells and other actions all require action points to preform in combat. Your character gains a certain amount of AP at the start of each turn depending on their individual stats, You can also save unused action points for the next turn. Combat is very tactical and a huge number of factors come into play including enemy type, strengths, weaknesses, distance, timing and more. On top of this you don't have to have all your party will you at the same time so if you spot an enemy cohort you can actually engage in combat with half of you party and then sneak the other half around the back, there by flanking the enemy thus getting not only the drop on them but also combat bonuses too.\n\nBy far the crown jewel of combat is the environmental factors and the ability turn the tide of a battle just by manipulating the battlefield. Everything can be used and combined for example shoot a arrow and burst open an oil barrel, then use a fire spell to set the landscape on fire. Not only does the environment help you win battles but in tougher fights it becomes essential to use everything from poison gas clouds to lighting charged pools of water. One thing I personally like about the environmental aspect of combat is that the enemy AI will use things against you. Setting traps can backfire, you can be caught off-guard by a stray lighting bolt while your entire party is standing in water. Not only does the environment help both you and your enemies but because of the way the mechanic is designed, things can escalate to utter chaos destroying both you and your enemy.\n\nFinally I want to talk about the games story. Larian have always been good storytellers and Original  Sin is no different. The quality of the writing is good and there is plenty of quest content to do throughout the game. One thing Larian is renowned for is their sense of humour when it comes to their games and writing. Original Sin is packed with quips, references and jolly good humour. Even if it doesn't have your side's splitting, it will give you a laugh at least a few times.\n\nOverall Larian have produced a real gem with Original Sin and a fitting addition to the Divinity franchise. While I would have liked better character models, more voice acting and some changes here and there, it has to be said that whether your an avid RPG player or not, Divinity Original Sin is a game not only worth owning but worth playing.\n\n","July 18, 2014","true","21.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

In this note he states that he has been given the gift of flight by a statue and is about to jump off a cliff to experience the thrill of freedom that comes with flying.\nYou read this note.\nYou look at the body.\nYou look up at the rockface.\nYou think,'That is a bad joke, or perhaps a note left to hide a murder. In a bad way.'\nWhat do you find out?\nIt is no joke or a ploy to hide a murder. It is exactly what happened.\n\nIf you can't figure out why this is a badly written scene, than please visit the neares bookshop or bookwebsite and get yourself say a Sherlock Holmes book or perhaps some good fantasy novel. And if you are not into books, get Torment to compare this to.\n\nOriginal sin is written by juveniles with juveniles in mind. Actually I am overstating this and apologize to the juveniles. This game just has ♥♥♥♥ poor lazy writing. It is a cavalcade of bad dialog, trite stories, embarrasingly bad humor and unispired quests. I imagine grown men in a computer filled cellar giggling at each other when they got the brainwave to change sorcers to sourceres. How decidely funny that was. And so brilliant. No really?\n\nSo what about those 465 hours?\nAnd here we have the part that I recommend. You see I play this co-op and try to ignore the badly written awful stuff. Sometimes  even my companion gets irked at me and says something like, 'Yes it is bad, just ignore it.'\nHe is right of course.\nOf the 465 hours he probably put in 400 or something. For he is a meticously guy. He is opening those boxes and reloading until he hits the jackpot and finds a legendary bow or armor with the proper statistics. Amazingly patient.  I wouldn't have the patience for it.\nAs a single player I wouldn't recommend it all and I am certain it will never get in anyone's top 10 list of greatest roleplay games ever and might even get in the top 10 worst written roleplay games ever.\nEven as a co-op it doesn't shine, but given the lack of fantasy role play co-op games it is passable. No doubt we will be buying the sequel for co-op fantasy games remain a rarity, however badly written. And given the track record of Divinity francise it probably is.","May 19","true","465.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"

Combat, story, writing, movement, graphics, interface, every single aspect of this game is just so incredibly solid and well done, and you just keep wanting to play until the crack of dawn and/or until your eyeballs crystallize.  The story and world is just so rich and oozing with character.\n\nOne minor criticism is sometimes it can be hard to know where to go, and sometimes the quest journal is a bit messy.  I stayed around in the second area for the longest time, not understanding that I wasn't supposed to really quest there yet.  Funny enough, that actually made the game more difficult, and again more enjoyable, so it ended up working out in the end.\n\nAlso, never reject any quests in the game (unless they ask you to kill allies).  For example, don't reject the fabulous five, or the guy in the second area's town.  You just end up missing out on good stuff regardless of what they want you to do.\n\nDon't go with "lone wolf" at first if you can avoid it, get companions from the first town and play the game normally.  Also, avoid trying to min/max too hard.

A deep and meaningful storyline, gorgeous graphics and highly detailed/varied environments, clean and uncluttered UI, incredibly unforgiving and challenging yet enjoyable turn-based combat, characters that you actually care about, deep character customization, plenty of humor, an expansive gameworld, well thought out lore, numerous bosses (large and small) and a large amount of different units and enemies, traditional RPG systems....must I continue? D:OS is a memorable experience that has a very well-designed co-op that allows for drop-ins, easy transfers of inventory, and Steamworks support.  They have created a developer kit to allow for custom campaigns and content, so there is a large potential for what could be endless content.  The storyline and content in the vanilla game is very lengthy and varied itself, all while managing to avoid falling victim to mundane quests and repetitive actions.  Excellent sound design, great art style, and an enjoyable soundtrack just make the game even easier to play.  Whether playing by yourself or with a friend, D:OS is sure to provide you with many dozens of hours of enjoyment.  Highly recommend at full retail price and I believe the game has serious potential to get Game of the Year.","July 5, 2014","true","119.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Some quick context, we played the game with double lone wolf characters(A fighter and a wizard) on medium difficulty. Your experience with combat balance may vary.\n\nFirst, let me start off by saying that this game is fun... Like REALLY fun. However, this is less of a game, and more of an experience. Let me explain what I mean by that. First of all, the combat is incredibly enjoyable. Every encounter feels hand crafted to give players a new strategic scenario almost every time. This was a real draw of the game for the friend I was playing with. As he put it, "it was one of the few games that actually makes a wizard feel like a wizard."\n\nThe draw for me however, was the world itself. I was in awe at this game's sense of wonder, while still remaining light hearted and humorous at times. It brought me back to childhood memories such as reading "The Hobbit" for the very first time. As the game went on, things got dark... Like really dark. It was probably my own fault for being so caught up in the game world, but I felt physically sick at times. This gave me a real drive to find the evil, and destroy it (trying not to be too spoilery).\n\nI've seen a lot of people complain about the endless dialogue in this game, and I can understand that, but I think it depends on what you are looking for coming into this game. I adored all of the dialogue, and being able to interact with this fantasy world that truly felt alive. Luckily, for my friend that didn't enjoy that all that much was able to find entertainment out of the combat encounters, and since we were playing on coop, I could do all of the dialogue work for him.\n\nNow, lets talk problems with the game. First of all, the game still feels like it needs to be worked on (IE missing content, and bugs). The good news about that is... It's still being worked on. Bugs and imbalances that I've found one day, I found were patched the next.\n\nA couple of the puzzles in the game straight up feel unfair. I feel no guilt in having to have looked up a couple answers online, as some of them were simply frusterating for reasons that could have been otherwise avoided.\n\nThere are a few problems with clarity. I know this is suppose to be a hard-core game, not for those with a casual approach, but some things are just tedious, not challenging, nor do they help engage you with the world. The biggest example of this is inventory management. A simple fix would be to have a separate tab, similar to the keys tab, for ALL quest items. That way you aren't having to manage important quest items with loot, and you don't accidently sell any of those quest items. Even the sidequest items.\n\nSomething else I should touch on is the editor. This thing brings a ton of extra value to Divinity. Whether you're a modder yourself, or you just want to play someone elses adventure. There are still some problems with it, but the development team has been supporting it quite strongly from what I've seen so far.\n\nConclusion/tl;dr:\nThis is all from my own experience and perspective.\nNumber scores are pointless.\nI would recommend this game.","August 26, 2014","true","87.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Very intuitive to visualy and quickly understand how many action points you still have until you "pass" and it's realy not overly complicated nor terribly slow/tactical. Animations in combat are realy flashy so that helps a little for it not being boring or slow.\n\nCoop is a diferent world that what we are used to see. If you play with a friend the dialog options (and decisions) are shared by both and both can disagree and that leads to truly fun discussions. I just love making my wife mad by just disagreeing with everything she wants in-game, it's priceless.\n\n\nAbout the game uniqueness, i believe it's the "old school" vibe of RPGs, and especialy the feeling that you are not being "led" and "hand-hold" by the game. When you discover something or acomplish something cool, you feel proud because you were smart enough to do that on your own and don't feel you were pushed into it. Also the freedom to do whatever you want in choices and still be able to progress in the game. You can kill a quest giver you don't like because you have the "urge" to do it, and it's fine most of the time you can get a similar quest in a diferent way later on.\n\n\nIt's a game that chalenges you to do what you feel it's interesting. It doesnt scream at you to do stuff the way the developers wanted because they think its the proper way to do it, it doesnt punish you too much if you want to experiment alone. It has that old school vibe in a time that games were suposed to be about player interaction, and not so much as watching a movie on trails.\n\n\nCan't explain much better. If you like 10 hour action packed games that look like a movie, don't play this. If you like a chalenging and rewarding game that doesn't tell you everytime what you "should be doing" this is worth it.\n\n\nI would wait a couple days for a patch tough, the dialog is too confusing atm.","June 30, 2014","true","73.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

As the developers of these games were slowly cannibalized by triple A studios, hopes for long awaited sequels were seemingly dashed and the genre seemed to only exist in blips on the emerging indie scene.\n\nAnd then suddenly, there was crowd funding. Larian studios had a vision, they knew what they wanted to accomplish. They wanted to bring the glory days back, and build something amazing. Divinity: Original Sin might be one of the best and most polished examples of Kickstarter done right. Instantly with character creation the game evokes that marvelous feeling of choice that has been missing from the more popular RPG's of the current generations. I'll be the first to admit that I probably started 6-7 new games, trying out various combinations and watching a few of them fail miserably, happily. Finally, an RPG that reunites me with a long lost love of mine, the potential to fail horrifically. So badly even, that you could waste hours of your time and not be able to pass various challenges the game throws at you due to negligent character creation.\n\nAs far as the story goes, I wasn't particularly moved nor was it very novel. However, it did progress well and kept the ball rolling. I do think that the challenge of the game and the thrill of exploration will push you to continuing the game more than the main storyline will. This game is filled with little, tantalizing secrets and interesting sidequests. Some events occured during sidequests that I never would have expected nor experienced in any other RPG.\n\nCombat is sufficient, but by no means is it fantastic. The most interesting aspect of it is how much it utilizes the environment. Some seemingly one-sided fights can be overcome with setting up explosive barrels, laying traps or creating barracades. Once again choice and planning are showing through as a main development philosophy. There were things that annoyed me. Enemies sometimes glitch out, simply standing still doing nothing even though there is nothing impeding them. Strangely it can be difficult to click on some enemies, making your character waste precious AP in the early game by moving when you wanted to attack or caste a spell. This can be especially annoying when you completely whiff a spell or god forbid send your mage to his/her death by moving them into a large group of enemies. Luckily, the game allows you to quicksave AT ANY CONCIEVABLE POINT, however a bit of polish could have done wonders. Towards the end of the game, combat becomes a tiring unengaging affair. After about 50 hours or so, you've seen every possible engagement and know how to successfully handle all of it.\n\nI mentioned that a bit of polish could have done wonders, and I think that leaks into many parts of the game. The UI is useable but by no means fantastic. Crafting is annoying and not particularly engaging. At the time of this little review, the game liked to crash during combat and cutscenes every now and again (Thank god for that quick save button).\n\nAt the end of the day, I sank 80 hours into this game. I enjoyed it thoroughly and even though this copy of mine was a gift, I would not regret purchasing it. Its charm and playability overcame its bugs and quick development. I hope we see more like this from Larian in the future and I hope other devs take note on how successful a game like Divinity: Original Sin can be.","January 12, 2015","true","80.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Because it's not, and the difference between those types of games and this one is very important.]\n\nAs you read this, keep in mind that I'm not far into the game at the time of writing. I spent some hours in game during Early Access, but waited to do this review until release to experience it in a more complete state, so these are more my initial impressions than a proper review and are subject to change at a later date (all alterations will be noted).\n\nFirst off, as the note above says, this game is not to be confused with something like Diablo, Torchlight or Path of Exile. While those are all fine games in their own right (yes, even Diablo 3), they are also ARPGs, which put you in real-time combat that more often than not comes down to spamming AOE skills to kill hordes of enemies. And that's fine, I love those games, too because they're good for quick co-op play. This game, however, being turn-based, places more emphesis on careful planning and development becasue rushing in to a fight and just relying on basic attacks will get you (and your co-op partner if you have one) killed in no time flat. So if you want a game you can dive into and mow through hordes of enemies, this isn't the game for you.\n\nOne key aspect of this game that will turn most people off is that it doesn't hold you hand. Yes, you can change the difficulty of the game, but thge UI itself doesn't have some features that other RPGs seems to think players need. There's no quest tracker, only a quest log that is just a list of what you've accomplished so far along a quest line (no hints). There's no quest markers on the map or compass, so you're on you own when it comes to finding where to go and what to do next (. There's no indicators on NPCs to say who has quests for you, and talking to NPCs is an actual dialog instead of a one-sided stream of text. And as far as a tutorial goes? Yeah, it's a quick dungeon that just tells you how to do a few things in the game, leaving you to learn everything else as you go. And you have to wonder, why did we need all of that stuff anyway? Half the fun of old RPGs like Ultima was in wandering around, finding out things for yourself and possibly getting killed because you wandered into a really high level area and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ something off (I did that a lot. It was fun).\n\nControl wise, this game plays like you'd expect a CRPG to play, and you quickly get used to using WASD to move the camera. However I wish the camera rotation was 360 by default as some of the angles make it hard to see things. You can switch to a "Tactical" view that'll highlight your party and enemies, switching you to a more top-down perspective, which I like as it can make planning easier during solo games.\n\nNavigating the character panel can seem a bit confusing, since the same window handles stats, inventory and equipment. But it only appears that way. Once you spend a moment to look it over and know what is where, it actualy makes more sense than having seperate windows. Although Skills are in a seperate window, but you only get new ones by reading expensive Skill Books (not leveling) so this seperation makes sense.\n\nEDIT #1: I've spent a good 2-3 hours wandering around the first town trying to solve a murder, earned an achievement that I didn't notice until after I quit the game, and I still ahve no idea who I'm suposed to talk to or arrest. I am literilly just doing random crap in the hopes that it works. In the process I have gained 6 quests, died in combat (for stealing) 3 times, died buy a massive booby-trap once, and had to retrace a good portion of my progress because I forgot to save before I got killed by guards... Best. Game. EVER.\n\nEDIT #2: I'm now close to 20 hours into the game. There have been many deaths, several rage quits, a few instances of pleading "Help!" on the forums and a brief span of time in which I was forced to lower the difficulty in order to progress (shocking, I know). In that time I have learned several things. 1st; SAVE. Do it often. 2nd; Some boss encounters will aggrivate you to no end, so when all else fails, run... seriously, turn and run like a girl with her panties on fire. 3rd; There are some quests that seem as if their just there to troll you. And understand that all this progress and I'm *STILL* not done with all the quests in the beginning town and surrounding area. This is going to be a 100+ hour game for me and my OCD brain.\n\nEDIT #3: There are moments in this game where it pulls a Gandalf and all but screams "You shall not pass!" Going along a quest line, when the highest level of the last enemy you faced was 9 (the same level as you) and suddenly it jumped to 15? That's a BIG hint from the gmae, telling you to go do something else, first.","June 30, 2014","true","24.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It doesn't depend on voice acting, expensive CGI cutscenes and carefully tailored "streamlined" (read: dumbed down for higher mass appeal) gameplay.\n\nThe game offers refreshing mechanics, deep storylines, and intriguing character customization. During almost the whole gameplay you have 5-10 different quests to take on. It's up to you when you prefer talking to a bunch of people or dive into a battle headfirst.\n\nSpeaking of battles! Tactics do matter big time. The creators put effort in making clashes with the enemy different. Rain, oil filled barrels, a pesky priest resurrecting the fallen foes from an (almost) perfectly defended spot push you to situations where you carefully need to plan your every step. (If you like to play on hard, as I do.)\n\nAt this point the interface, although functional, could use a few shortcuts. Getting a grip on your inventory can be problematic a few hours in. Using skills on items by someone (identify, repair) are currently a chore.\n\nI can recommend this game to any RPG enthusiast, who likes the general feel and effort put in old school games, but also wants to see updated graphics, and improved gameplay mechanics.","May 15, 2014","true","299.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

So please be grateful, because I could be playing my game instead ;)  This game is the best computer RPG I've ever played--PERIOD.  I prefer RPG's where you have a small party of adventurers rather than a lone wolf, and this game even offers the ability to play co-operatively with a friend!  The turn based combat is so addictive that it makes me wish there was some type of battle arena in the game, where you could just send your party to go fight groups of monsters or mages in various environments.\n\nThis is not to say the game is perfect, because there is the small matter of some puzzles in the game being ridiculously difficult, and I just don't see the need for that.  In most cases, there is a hint or clue that you can find and it'll help you solve the puzzle, but there are a few cases where the only way to solve it is to try dozens of combinations and waste your precious gaming time (possibly getting annoyed in the process), or you have to leave your game and hop on a search engine to locate the tips you need to solve the puzzle.  I feel these puzzles actually detract from the overall experience of the game, because after a couple of frustrating puzzles, I have an almost knee-jerk reaction to all puzzles in the game--that is to say that if I don't figure out a puzzle within a minute, I am tempted to save myself a lot of time and aggravation by just returning to the handy game guide I found on the internet.  A game shouldn't send the player running away to use a search engine--it should keep the player happily engaged in the game.  Of course, I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who enjoy puzzles, but I'm not one of them, and if i was, I'd probably buy a puzzle game instead of a role playing game.  So my advice on puzzles is to try them but cheat the moment you feel frustrated, because the rest of the game is a lot of fun and you shouldn't waste time on the worst part of the game ;)  (Too bad no one advised the developers not to waste time on those puzzles...)\n\nIgnoring that one drawback, you are likely to fall in love with this game.  The environments are gorgeous and maps are very well designed, the soundtrack is amazing and really pulls you deeper into the experience.  The quests and adventures in this game are likely to entertain you, and you'll have many opportunities for actual role playing in this game, which is something missing from pretty much every other RPG I've ever played on a computer.  In this game, you get to choose dialogue between the characters, which effects their attitude toward each other and shapes their relationships throughout the game.  I'm sure every playthrough will feel quite different because of the characters you make and how you choose to play them.  One final thing I wanted to mention is that crafting and blacksmithing are more fun in this game than any other game I've played in this genre.  I always enjoy collecting ingredients and combining them to make awesome gear (that is often better than items you can purchase from vendors).  In other games, alchemy and crafting were side activities that rarely ever resulted in something more useful than a healing potion, but in Divinity: Original Sin it's fun and rewarding just discovering new recipes and experimenting with your ingredients.\n\nI absolutely recommend this game to everyone who is a fan of role playing games and turn based combat.  It's definitely one of my favourite computer games in my entire collection!","July 30, 2014","true","270.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","2"

I have noticed through out the years that the games have become easier and easier to play, just for the sake of profit making, but this game made me feel intelligent once again. The game was taking my intelectual needs as a veteran player very seriousely. It was very nostalgic of an era when you felt that playing a game was actually worth your time ( Like the Legend of Zelda and Shadowrun on super Nintendo). After many years of putting down my joystick, once again i experienced sleepless nights, houres of full concentration flying by in a breath, using every bit of my Neurons that were giving me "Nerdgasms" one after another.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Incompl/recommended/230230/","Incompl","Incompl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Incompl/","4564 products in account","This game is the real deal. It is a modern Baldur's Gate/Ultima VII that really raises the bar for interactivity and freedom in a western RPG. However, it does demand your undivided attention. Divinity: Original Sin is NOT a game that you can pick up and play offhandedly. The world and characters are rich and the game makes no effort to hold your hand through any of it. When you want something, you have to reach out and grab it yourself. For many players, this could be an obstacle. I had a lot of fun discovering the different ways I could use objects and the environment in all the different situations. I struggled at first with D:OS, because I was limiting myself to using what I had learned in other RPGs that were much more shallow when it came to interactivity.\n\nFrom the outset, you're allowed to walk into areas you clearly are not yet meant to see. You're allowed to progress quests that are too dire for you. You are allowed to do absolutely anything you want after the brief introduction. You can fight guards (and probably die), you can rob people, you can accuse people of things they did not commit. There's no "perfect" game, and especially refreshing is the fact that there is no good-evil continuum. There are only actions and reactions. The first barrier to new players is realizing that there is no point at which the game will solve a problem for you.\n\nThe second barrier is realizing that this is a game where it pays to think as if it was real life. If you can't find a key, you can bash the door down. If someone has something you want.. well, you can satisfy their request in exchange for the item... or you can buy it from them (EVERY NPC can be bartered with). Or, you can simply kill them and take it. You can kill that person, but the people they know might be overcome with sadness and become unwilling to help. If they know you killed them, their friends might just try to kill you. If you find a pumpkin, you can carve it with a knife and wear it on your head. If you pick up a bucket, you can also wear that, but it will be difficult to see. If you have the teleport spell, you can teleport enemies into objects for severe crushing damage. You can steal a candle from an inn and later use it to ignite a pool of oil in battle. Water and blood conduct electricity. And that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of just how deep this game really is...\n\nD:OS really covers its bases if you're somebody who gets extreme joy in thinking "outside-the-box". If you're on the fence in deciding whether or not to buy, I would say go ahead and pull the trigger. This game holds a ton of value, even with the current $40 price tag.\n\n9.5/10","July 7, 2014","true","45.3"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

While the out of combat quests and events are also different and fun, exploring dungeons and doing some detective work all while stealing some chick's dirty undies... (To be honest I'd rather steal her husbands...) And oh God is the dialogue fun and witty.\n\nI highly recomend picking up this game and playing it with a friend who's personality is different than yours.

If you are a D&D-er, you need this game.  If you are a tabletop player of any kind, you need this game.  If you are an RPG fan, you need this game.  If you are a tactical thinker, you need this game.  If you are a level designer, you need this game just for the toolkit.  Bottom line, if you don't have Divint: Original Sin, do you even game?\n\nAs you can tell, I love Divinity.  It's a sort of a throwback to the Baulder's Gate type of game, and it is brilliantly executed.  The environments are amazing.  The monsters are well done.  The dialog is engaging and meaningful.  Choices matter.  All good.  But, this wouldn't be a proper review without some honest critiques of how it could be improved.\n\nFirst negative, class balance.  This was a probably early one in the beta, but it's better now the day before launch.  It's still not completely fixed, though.  Intelligence based builds still rule in terms of raw, content-clearing power.  But, the game is still more fun with a diverse group make up.  It's not a big issue, but it's one the min/maxer may pick up on pretty quickly.\n\nSecond negative, limit on co-op players.  You can only play co-op with two players.  The reasons are understandable, and it's largely forgivable given that more players are supported for mod content.  But, after playing though 8 hours of the story with a friend yesterday, I can't help but feel that this whole experience would just be phenomenal with a full group of 4-6 people.  Just the shenanigans with two were hilarious.  I think of the eight hours I might have spent 3 not on fire, not being melted by steam clouds, or not being shocked to death by jumping lightning in the rain.  Friendly fire is real, and watching a completely new player learn the system while playing a wizard was gloriously painful.  I long so much to have that same experience with more people, more wayward spells, more poorly conceived plans, more failures, more accidental explosions, all around more WTF.\n\nLastly, the crime system.  Let me just say that even a "good" character is probably going to resort to a degree of thievery to fill their purse.  It only makes sense.  It's hard to descibe why this is the case.  Much of it has to do with a somewhat low drop rate for your needed skill books as you progress and the very readily available goods that can pilfered with impunity.  Once you finally come across that NPC who has your skill books you need, every painting in the room will start to look like... well... yours.  That's not a bad thing.  Temptation is a good mechanic in these sorts of games.  But, in the first town alone, I racked up well over fifteen thousand gold just from yanking up whatever I could carry when no one was looking.  We could probably use a few more guard patrols to make having a rogue more necessary (needing to pick locks quickly instead of just having time to bash them to pieces).\n\nOverall, I'm a solid 9.5/10 on this game.  The issues that are there are minor (except the co-op player limit which is in fact raised for mods).  You owe it to yourself to play this game.  Don't be turned off by words like "turn-based."  While it is turn-based, it's the type of turn-based that moves quickly and doesn't detract from the overall experience.  It actually enhances your experience.  You'll need to see it all in action to understand, but I stand by the fact that you need to try it.  Get this game.  If it's not in your cart already, you're doing it wrong.\n\nSummary\n\n+Great gameplay\n+Amazing environments\n+Compelling dialog\n+Awesome spell/ability system\n+Very well done co-op mode\n+Choices matter\n+Good music\n+Loads of content\n\n-Co-op player limit of 2 for the main story\n-Some class/abilty imbalances\n-Thievery is way too easy, so much that it doens't make sense not to do it\n\n++New players will kill you by accident... a LOT\n\n+++I charged a skeleton and whacked it with my sword.  My buddy broke an oil barrel, summoned a fire elemental, ignited the whole thing, caught two "suicide bomber" skeletons with explosives tied to their backs in the initial boom, and we waited for the fire and smoke on the screen to clear to find out everything including our own party were dead and toasty.  Came back and got fried by that same buddy's electricity in the rain.  Must... play... more.","June 30, 2014","true","47.7"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

It is certainly very rough around the edges but there is ALOT of promise here. I have played a little bit of single player and ALOT of co-op. Very fun co-op. A few things that do bug me but im sure will be fixed later concerning co-op. The player hosting the game will have control over all of the henchmen you get. This can make for a little boredom for the 2nd player during battles. Keep that in mind. Also if you are having issues figuring out how to start co-op.....Click join and then pick your friend on the steam overlay and join game. Make sure to use some sort of communication outside of the game as there is NONE in the game at all. I hope they add some sort of voice/text chat in the game at some point. Also you will be joining someone else's game so be sure to discuss with them what type of character you want so that they can premake them for you!\n\nGraphics are pretty good. Sound is good when its working properly. Sometimes it cuts in and out and the music can get a little loud at times even with it turned down. Play control is a little slow and a tad sloppy but that is to be expected during an alpha. There are some balancing issues for sure. Mages seem way overpowered right now. Ranger is not very good at all IMO. You do virtually no damage. I have played alot of hours as a ranger and have started leaning towards spellcasting even with my ranger!\n\nHave had a few minor glitches but overall this is very playable.

There is a sense of freedom in this game that is thoroughly refreshing.  It is clear that Larian Studios has put a great deal of thought, time and effort into this already.  It's easy to get drawn in to what you are doing because the environment reacts accordingly.  You are free to develop your character outside of class boundaries.  You are encouraged to develop the characters individually.  The player isn't forced to play the characters as friends.  They can argue and have disputes, intimidate, charm and convince one another.  This I found to be particularly appealing, and it went a long way towards drawing me in.  For the most part, the dialog choices aren't your standard Good, Neutral and Bad either, which is also nice.  There is no moral compass other than the one you bring.  The fact that Larian has made a genuine effort to address these possibilities speaks volumes to the direction and depth they're bringing to the title.\nLarian has taken that same approach with the players’ interaction with the environment.  The player isn't in a static environment and has a level of interaction with the environment that is unparalled in games of this type.  This sense of freedom, of ‘what can/should/would I do?’ is throughout all aspects of the game, from the pacing to the crafting system and all of the other things I have yet to try.  It does a great job of keeping you curious, entertained and occupied because there is very little in this game that is linear or forced upon the player.  I find it easy to get drawn into the world they are building because I can do things in the time and manner of my choosing.  With what they’ve got going on with the character development, the environment, the crafting, the magic system, the audio, and everything else Larian has demonstrated a fantastic creative spirit and attention to detail.\n","January 18, 2014","true","61.6"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raubrey/recommended/230230/","raubrey","raubrey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raubrey/","200 products in account","I've never had a more difficult time rating a game than Divinity Original Sin because 1) It's one of a kind. 2) Expectations were quite high for an epic RPG 3) There are so few decent turn-based and even real-time with pause RPGs so it *had* to be good, just had to...or else it was back to replays of old favorites (again).\n\nI will give it two ratings, one for my experience and one tempered with others' feedback in consideration (see below) as my personal experience score is both lower and possibly atypical.\n\nOverall, I give it 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nThe breakdown:\n\nInteractive environment (5)\n\nStory/dialog/pace - drags on, not inspiring (3)\n\nCompanions  (2) lifeless (correction - 1 point for ability, 1 for existence)\n\nGraphics (4.5)\n\nCombat  (3.5) --repetitive, but neat spells/skills.\n\nMusic (3.8) Edit  -- 4+ as standalone and main theme, in particular, but not in-game. Mostly very light and less inspiring in context of the atmosphere, unlike other Divinity games.\n\nOverall enemy variety & game world (5)\n\nLeveling (3.5) - slow and unrewarding though refreshingly different with Action Points.\n\nDependability/bugs (3.5) --needs a few more patches but is mostly smooth.\n\nReplayabilty (4) (if you like it yes, if not, no)\n\nGameplay Hours - (5) Fantastic! 60-150 hours.\n\nTactics -- lots of cheese/repetition (3.5)\n\nMods/Editor - (potentially 5 but to be determined).\n\nVoice acting (3) - limited.\n\nLoot (5) For loot maniacs. May be overabundant for some players.\n\nQuests  (4) --better than average, not so fetchy.\n\nPuzzles - Yes - love or hate them\n\nAtmosphere  (3) e.g. lack of dynamic weather, immersive sound and dungeons are not scary.\n\nDynamic Events - largely absent\n\nConsequences - few or not impacting other than in combat.\n\nMap / Inventory/Journal  (2.5 to 3)\n\nCrafting - (3.5)\n\nA problem with the game is that the sum is not greater than its parts. It would make a much better 30-40 hour game than an  epic-length one, in its current state given it stalls out for story-driven, if not combat, players.\n\nBut, if you come to the game with no expectations of Baldur's Gate et al. and in a light-hearted mood (for tis not a dark/mature game) your money should be well-spent. You may even love the game, some really do.\n\nIf you're looking for the next epic classic RPG,though, you're on the road to disappointment. So come equipped with an open-mind for best results.\n\n***If you like turn-based RPGs Divinity Original Sin is most worth taking a look at *** and it may well one day be considered a cult classic as the niche following is strong.\n\n----------------------\n\nMy personal experience rating, however, is 3.5 -3.8.\n\nI'm an older gamer and don't necessarily represent the majority of Larian fans, though love most of their games. Original Sin started as a holiday dinner and soon became two-day old, leftover turkey sandwiches after 40ish hours -- stale and bland, though a bit tasty with salt when available. I actually quit the game 3/4 the way through, from boredom,though plan to return to it someday (tm).\n\nMy standards are rather distinct for an RPG and in disclosure I lean strongly towards Neverwinter Nights series or Baldur's Gate-type games (aside from strategy, open-world and select aRPGs) as well as those with darker undertones.\n\nAdditionally, I even felt Shadowrun,  XCom and Disciples combat was much more enjoyable. I think with mods this game could turn around. Right now it is a diamond in the rough, or so it appears. Multiplayer may offer a ton of fun and that I am unable to comment on.\n\nLastly, of note, my Steam hours are artificially inflated -- both with Alpha and leaving the game running. The real-hours are closer to 150, but nonetheless I well got my money's worth at that rate. The game is better than average but needs serious work to shine.\n\nMost importantly, it needs a soul.\n\nStill, future games in this genre will have a new threshold to meet in modernized cRPGs.","August 22, 2014","true","341.8"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","9"

Not quite as good as the grandfathers of D&D style of RPG's like Baldur's Gate, Icewind dale or Planescape torment, but it is certainly worth the money. instead of buying packs in Hearthstone, support these indie-developers and hope the love for old-school RPG's will be rekindled.","July 15, 2014","true","57.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It might not mean much seeing as I've only played baldur's gate 2 and drakensang before this, but this game should set an example to all future RPG games. The interactivity is amazing, if it's not the ground/a building you can interact with it, and in many ways. Even things that would be trivial in other games like crates and barrels, load up your inventory with them, go into combat, and make a maze while you're in combat, or sneaking around and dropping them off while you scurry back a safe distance to initiate.\n\nAnother thing that stands out is that EVERY stat/talent/ability matters, and you should have each member be varied in what they're expertised in so that you have someone for every situation. Perception lets you spot secrets/traps/switches, and is even needed for discovering things in the main story to continue so it's not just a trivial stat that you can reload every time you step on a trap, Having a character with leadership grants a boost to your whole parties initiative, damage, precision and so forth. Having a loremaster lets you identify items, enemies, and objects... and so on.\n\nThe crafting system is pretty nice too, generally if you think two items should combine they generally do. For example, a branch + nine inch nails would make a spiked club, though if things don't combine you may need a higher crafting level :P.\n\nThere's absolutely NO hand holding, past a few tutorial popups which just tell you the basics, When you're initiating a quest, you're expected to read through and actually find this location without any help markers, no ignoring the story you must read some of the finer details.\n\nThe things I've listed above are only what's on the surface, It's a very deep and detailed game, and compared to modern rpgs, a godsend. I wholly recommend this to anyone who is interested in classic rpgs, and even modern rpg fans (though the difficulty may be a bit much for a casual ;), there is an easy setting... I haven't tried it though, I hear it's much easier than default though.)","July 16, 2014","true","20.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay is clever and interesting, allowing for different ways of solving fights and problems. Characters and interaction are especially good and differ from the norm for these kinds of games. The co-op makes for a fun way of playing, while single player allows for being nitpicky to the most minor of details.\n\nCombined with a good soundtrack, pleasing art style and some solid story and gameplay, this game is a good addition to anyone's library.","February 9, 2015","true","124.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is easily the best rpg of this style I have played in over a decade.\n\nThe community's reviews are spot on for the most part (about the awesomeness of this game), but I just want to point out a few things that I felt the game could improve on:\n\n- The game has a steep learning curve (I actually enjoyed this and it was my favorite part about the game). But here was the issue. Once I figured out the learning curve and learned the mechanics, the game suddenly felt too easy and exploitable. Some of the mechanics are far too overpowered once you understand how they interact. In this sense, it was extremely gratifying to get to this point, but once this point of understanding was achieved, I became incredibly bored. Even on the hardest difficulty you can simply "out-mechanic" the game by using cheese tactics. Some skills need to be rebalanced.\n\n- The inventory system is awkwardly tedious. I won't go in depth but the way the loot is split between your characters and split gold and all that nonsense... it just adds more micromanagement. I understand this is more realistic, but it doesn't add anything interesting and only takes up your time.\n\n- This is much more personal opinion I suppose, but I felt like some of the story arcs were far too drawn out. One of the driving factors in a game is the feeling like you are making progress - progress is good. But some of the lengths of the main quests in this game are sooooo long and I started to lose interest. I just wanted to know what happened next, but it took so long to get to it. There's a fine line between creating suspense/interest and the time it requires to build it. If you build it for too long, interest will be lost.\n\nMinus the points mentioned above, Divinity OS is a great title, and I highly recommend it.\n\nP.S. - As a quick side note, this game does not hold your hand. If you are not willing to spend about 5-7 hours just figuring out the basic mechanics of the game, you will not enjoy this title.\n\n8/10","February 15, 2015","true","75.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Their alpha was impressively polished a few months ago and it just got better as the days went on. Larian was so on point, it was sick (in the good way! :P).\n\nNow playing the official release is just pure joy.  I'm right back where I was in the 90s playing so many of the amazing cRPG titles that were so much fun and D:OS has brought that all back and then some.  Crowdfunding/EA has allowed Larian to make the game they always wanted to make with total creative freedom and it shows, ohmgosh does it show.\n\nSure there have been some hiccups since launch with issues but there has also been a steady stream of updates as Larian listens to all the feedback and fixes the issues as they pop up.\n\nThe modding toolkit is ready as well and just waiting for Valve to flip the switch so there is a whole lot more of the goodness to be had from talented modders out there.

When i started playing it i expected it to be Baldur's Gate's spiritual successor, and while that's not really the case it is still a great game in it's own right. And it took me 85 hours to complete one playthrough, that's like... 20 times more than the average game nowdays.\n\nThe combat system is fenomenal, possibly the best part of the game. Turn-based might sound boring to a lot of people, but if you give it a chance it's surprising how addicting it gets once the battle starts. Think of it like X-COM, but without the clunky movement and horrible RNG. And way more abilities.\n\nThe main story isn't the game's strongest aspect, and while i wouldn't call it generic i'd say it's quite forgettable. However the world is filled with the usual Larian tongue-in-cheek humor, similar to games like Sacred 2, and many interesting encounters such as talking wells and a romantic sidequest between two cats.\n\nThe music is great to listen to and doesn't get repetitive. There's a lack of voiced dialogue but this is already taken care of in the Enhanced Edition.\n\nMy only complaints are the lack of banter between party members and the awful rock-paper-scissors minigame when there are decisions to be made, which works well in co-op but is complete garbage when playing alone.\n\nI recommend it to anyone interested in RPGs.","October 27, 2015","true","85.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At first I was a little hesitant, as it wasn't what I had expected and it seemed super slow almost to the point of being turned off. But I stuck it out and i'm really glad that I did...\n\nNegative first. Foremost I must say that this is truly the only negative thing that I have to say at all. I want more information on character building BEFORE I make my character. I was not originally aware that you must save skill points to further upgrade those skills later - this was a major mistake and i was forced to reset my game so as not to of wasted any skill points nonchalantly. Secondly, I think more emphasis should be put on how important it is to make your party varied in the elemental arts as well as the NEED for a ranged character. So far the best group i've come up with is a mage and a thief/mage (splitting elemental types between them), an archer and a high defense, high constituition knight of sorts. Variety in your skills is MANDO! And make your characters masters of ONE or TWO set of skills. Do not make jack of all trades - it will weaken your part as a whole.\n\nCOMBAT:\nThe turn based combat delivered on a high level and surpassed the high standards that I had for it. I truly enjoy ALL aspects of combat from ranged skills and melee / rogue type abilities to the more jaw dropping elemental magics that intertwine with the local environment. For example, I electrocuted an Orc Shaman while he was standing in a puddle. It just so happens that his two body guards were standing in the same puddle. BAM! All three instantly damaged and shocked, losing a turn. Not to mention being able to cast water spells near a teammate to do damage to your enemies but put out the flames burning your partners shoulders to a crisp.\n\nWORLD:\nI haven't explored much yet but everything that I've seen so far has been put together very well. From item placement and decorations to broad scale placement of dungeons, changing weather and variety of landscapes.\n\nNPCS:\nI normally skip through that NPC's say in other games. The usual B.S. filler type material that just get irritating - BUT in this game I've become more involved in the storyline and actually enjoy the bickering within the group as well as the diversity in NPC personalities. A lot of effort was put in to making the storyline full with a hint of sassy.\n\nSIDE NOTE:\nI am a bit OCD and a horder in games... and sometimes it ruins games for me because I spend too much time collecting things. Example would be, in Skyrim and Fallout 3. I spent hours upon hours just making sure that 'THIS' chest in my home had only Elvish equipment or Laser weapons. While 'THIS' chest had only Ebony gear or Plasma weapons. I like to seperate things so that I can easily go back and look for things later, plus it becomes a center of pride for myself in game. Odd? Maybe. But this game allows me to feed my sorter desires by giving me back packs and a "home" to store my people and valuables. I have backpacks for every different type of item and with the "pack mule" talent, its that much easier... I spent 2 out of my 10 hours just organizing and reoganizing. This may not be a selling point for some of you but for those who know what I'm saying...

Don't get fooled by the 4 overworld maps like I did - Each one takes many many hours to complete. There's a good enemy variety, but most of it is fantasy standard: Orcs, spiders, skeletons, ... They can have some nice/surprising abilities though. You'll spend quite some time in your inventory comparing stats of the tons of items you find and trying out some crafting recipes. Completing every (side-)quest and doing almost everything D:OS has to offer took about 105 hrs on hard difficulty - It's a long game but doesn't overstay its welcome. You'll see everything on a single playthrough except for some alternate consequences of choices you make. They aren't significant enough to justify playing it again though. However, the different char progressions and party setups do. For example, I never tried a stealthy rogue approach and rarely used witchcraft. Also, I highly suggest keeping an eye on the mod scene as those guys made me enjoy rpgs up to 4 times as long as intended...\n\nCombat\n-------------------\nIt's turn-based - each turn, a character gets action points depending on his stats to spend on movement, attacks or using items and once you're done, another character or enemy gets his turn.\nAfter using a spell/skill, there's a cooldown to prevent you (and your enemy) from using those high damage AoE spells every turn.\nA very cool aspect of the combat system is, that many spells work together or with the environment in some way. See a puddle of water? Electrify it and everything standing in it. Enemies enjoying some toxic gas? Throw a fireball and make it explode around them. Dragon Age 1 did something like this, but D:OS takes it even further.\nOf course enemies and yourself have resistances and immunities to elements, forcing you to adapt your strategy.\n\nBalance/Difficulty\n-------------------\nIn general, it's far more difficult than most modern rpgs and the only one since Dragon Age 1 that managed to kill me. Repeatedly :D Once you get used to how everything works, it's a lot easier than what you might expect though. In any case, the difficulty is too inconsistent - Early-game is quite hard because you have few good spells available, then in Luculla Forest and Hiberheim it gets a lot easier and then difficulty spikes again for a short time on the last map only to drop to zero near the end. Imho it SHOULD start fairly easy and then gradually get harder - I have yet to play a game that gets this right though (and it's probably impossible because difficulty is so subjective...) Except for one instance the game is not unfair - you always know exactly WHY the enemy wiped the floor with you.\nI like that the game randomly throws some bosses in your face - "Here, have a giant spider for no reason!" - and some of them like the Braccus Rex battle really require you to come up with a good tactic. The final boss was a big disappointment though and got boring quickly because you are so overpowered by then that it requires just time, no effort.\n\nChar progression/Skills\n-------------------\nYou get 2 main chars + 2 additional ones you can hire either in the area Cyseal or in your "base". On lvl-up you spend points in the usual rpg stats (strength, intelligence, ...) and a variety of different skills (like elemental magic). Every now and then you get to pick a special, powerful trait. You can develop your party however you want - there's nothing stopping you from making a fireball throwing warrior.\n\nStory/Quests\n-------------------\nThe writing is excellent with some highly enjoyable dialogues, but the story itself is... well, not bad but nothing special either and also pretty much linear. However, D:OS does a good job to keep you interested in what's gonna happen next. Most of the story is experienced in-game but every now and then you get a cutscene with a narrator talking over some artwork, which is pretty neat.\nQuests are pretty much rpg standard, but they are well written and often involve interesting characters. In many of them you get to make a choice and (if you activated AI personality or playing co-op) argue with your partner about how to do things which is often hilarious, especially in co-op. Sometimes your choice even has some consequence later in the game, although none of them is really significant.\n\nControls\n-------------------\nNot much to complain here: Inventory management works pretty well with all the automatic sorting options. Technically there's a limit of items you can carry based on weight, but it's not like Diablo where you have to return to town every 10 minutes. In fact, with 1 high strength warrior I never reached the limit once because even full plate armour doesn't seem to weigh too much.\nFor every char you get 5 bars with 10 slots each where you can put skills/spells/items for quick access via hotkeys. For late-game mages that's not enough for EVERY spell, but you won't be regularly using every single one of them anyway.\nSometimes it's easy to misclick and accidentally steal stuff or chuck a fireball where you didn't want to though.\n\nSound\n-------------------\nEffects are great and the music is absolutely fantastic. I'm not sure how many tracks there are, but I never got bored with them. There's little voice-acting (mostly for the 2 main chars) but the few parts that are voiced, are done quite well with talented actors.\n\nGraphics\n-------------------\nBecause I've been playing on a rather old PC (E6750, 4Gb Ram, Radeon HD4800) I wasn't able to try maximum settings, but even on medium the game looks pretty gorgeous. Most of the time you'll be playing zoomed out pretty far out but it's nice that it also looks good up close. It's very colorful with nice animations and spell effects - having half the screen explode with a meteor strike feels quite satisfying :) The world has been handcrafted very carefully with a lot of attention to detail and also offers more variety than you might think at first glance - Just when you get a little bored with grassland you stumble into a burning forest, get teleported to a frozen castle or stand on a ledge that essentially looks like the one in Mt. Doom :)\n\nPerformance\n-------------------\nOn my old system the game runs smoothly on medium - I guess you COULD play it on high on such a system if you're ok with occassional FPS drops. With my 32-bit OS I had the nasty problem that the game froze and ultimately crashed when saving after about 20 minutes. However, a fix mentioned on the forum worked just fine and I was able to play the following 105hrs without any crash/freeze. Saving/loading takes some time (~30s), but considering the amount of data that needs to be saved/loaded, I suppose that's still ok.\n\nBugs\n-------------------\nSurprisingly few. There's some items you should be able to get with telekinesis, but the game tells you you "can't reach" them for some reason. In Hiberheim I encountered what I think was a scrapped quest. There was also some treasure I didn't get, because an item I needed wasn't in the game. I couldn't finish one of the last sidequests, but I killed everyone involved so I'm not sure if that qualifies as a bug... ;)\n\nVerdict\n-------------------\nIs it perfect? Nah. But in terms of complexity, depth and atmosphere it DOES shame many rpgs of recent years made by bigger companies with a much higher budget. Some will tell you that with D:OS, there's finally an "old-school" and difficult experience around again, but I don't care about that. The important thing is - D:OS is a very well made and atmospheric rpg that really shows the devs love, passion and understanding for the genre.","October 7, 2014","true","111.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Basically no skipping all dialogue and then runing to a giant glowing red box on the map. Paying attention to the lore and story is an absolute must.\n- Mixing elements in with combat adds fantastic depth that can turn the tides of a battle in moments.\n- Turn based awesomeness. Reminds me of BG.\n- Unlimited repayability.\n\nCONS\n\n- No hand holding got a little ridiculous at times. I spent an hour in a cave wondering where to go next. Little did I know I needed to find a switch that is absolutely tiny @ 1920x1080 that is also the same color as the surface it's on, in the dark. I know questing is a huge thing in this game but this just seemed to be a gimic at times. At least light the switch up with a torch on the wall or something.\n- A few of the quests are extremely convoluted.\n- Sometimes I found myself cursing how bloody slow the players "ran". I heard there are tons of good mods on the workshop for items like this so it's a pretty minor detractor.\n- Possible to break quests by doing them out of order.\n\nOverall, it's a great game that has a lot of replayability. It took me just under 50 hours to finish my first run. I missed maybe a handful of side quests so that could likely be stretched to 60 - 70 hours.","October 14, 2014","true","48.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It’s turn-based, which has the downside of leaving me bored while I wait for enemies to act but the upside of giving me time to really think and plan.\n\nThere’s a multiplayer conversation system (which you can play both sides of if you’re playing a SP game, or assign the second protagonist an AI personality to automatically choose their own lines) which is even better than SWTOR’s because it actually takes into account whether the protagonists agree or disagree with one another; my only criticism is the rock-paper-scissors method of decision resolution if you disagree (it’s also used as the persuasion minigame when trying to convince NPCs). It’s affected by your proficiency with different persuasion styles, but it’s still a little game-y. That said, I don’t know how I would improve it.\n\nSo, very strong first impression.

We settled on the idea of getting into table top RPG's, and so we picked up Pathfinder. Immediately we fell in love with the roleplaying, the freedom, the stories, combat, and so on and so forth. There was a major downside to our new found love. Those with whom we shared our time with where "unique". Personally, I had nothing more against these individuals, other than I wish they utilized proper hygiene and did not emit the foul stench of cat urine. We stopped playing, but the itch for roleplaying continued, until I discovered this diamond of a game that Larian has produced. Just looking at the quality of work while this was in alpha was enough to make me salivate.\n\nThis game has a very special way of letting the player(s) go about tackling quests. You choose how you want to go about solving quests, and in many cases, I have found that I have never solved many of the quests the same way twice. The character creation is very thorough and in depth, where you choose your initial class. However, once you have chosen that class, if you point points into other talents and abilities you can create and customize a character that is specific to your interests. Larian has stated that they wanted to create an atmosphere that is reminiscent of table top RPG's, and I think that they have surpassed that goal. As of yet, I cannot say what it is like to play this game solo, due to fact that I am playing with my wife, however I would imagine it would still be enjoyable, but I highly recommend playing it with someone else if you have the ability to do so.\n\nLastly the price. The direction and vision Larian has for their new game is set to have no limit, whether content is created by them or modders. The price then seems almost too good to be true. With the attention that few other companies give to their games post launch, I feel Larian very deserving of my money, time, and attention. They have put out minor fixes everyday for since the game has launched. While we have not had any issues, other players may have, and for a company to listen so intently to the concerns of their customers as to put out hotfixes each day is almost unheard of anymore. $40 is a steal for how much I have been enjoying this game, it has been my guilty pleasure as a therapist to come home after a long day of helping others with their problems, and play for 4-6 hours with my sweetheart. It is truly an experience that I hope to continue as we become more involved and delve deeper into the depths of dungeons, becoming more involved in the world around us, and lastly enjoying every second of the problem solving.\n\nIf you are still on the fence about this game, give it a chance. Even if you do not like, consider the money spent as a donation to a studio very deserving of the positive recognition for this game. I cannot speak for their past works, but I will be paying attention to what they do in the future.","July 3, 2014","true","50.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Similar to Temple of Elemental Evil but not burdened by a PnP mechanic system nor the desire to recreate a PnP module. Single player alone would be amazing, but the multiplayer through the campaign is fully supported and essentially plays out like all the good parts of a PnP session (down to internal party conflicts, if minimally) with all the benefits of being a CRPG. The combat system is incredibly deep but follows consistent rules and heavily rewards clever tactics, with huge emphasis on proper positioning and use of environment.\n\nThe game is also quite challenging, giving a reason to need good tactics. Crowd control is brutal, you will almost always be outnumbered and your enemies are not afraid to lock your party down if you mess up. A number of special encounters also introduce little gimmicks, ensuring major fights don't get completely repetitive.\n\nOn top of that, the game is fairly freeform within the constraints of a linear plot. Most side quests have alternative resolutions that can impact how other missions play out. The quests themselves are handled as journal entries rather than specific tasks and rewards exploration and proactive investigation.\n\nThe only real issues are that the very end game feels a bit rushed (that said, this is after 50+ hours of very high production quality campaign) and, arguably, balance issues (due to the emphasis on battlefield control, ranged and caster characters are extremely strong in comparison to melee). However, the balance is debatable and on the whole a lot more enjoyable due to the high differentation in the skillsets compared to a very tightly tuned skillset, and the ability of any character to essentially multiclass freely gives you lots of options if something isn't working out.","July 14, 2014","true","180.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It ranks by classics like Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale, Might & Magic 3 - 6. Everything is top notch.\n\nThe story and written content - Superb, immersive, beliveable and fun.\nThe music, sound and voiceover - Fantastic quality on everything, and adds to the immersion.\nThe RPG system - Just right. The action point combat system is fun, the character development options are great.\nItem system - Good, lots of various equipment, which you again can bolster using crafting, or create yourself from scratch.\nLength - Very good. Took me about 70 hours to finish the first time through. If Ive done everything and read all books etc., Im thinking you can easily dive 100 hours into a playthrough.\n\nReplayability - Good. Choose a harder difficulty, and a totally different setup. Its also a perfect coop game to play through with a friend. Also, there are "good" and "evil" dialogue options which gives different quest outputs and and dialogues. Interesting quests on top of this makes it very replaayable.\n\nVery recommended ! :)","October 15, 2014","true","94.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You can count me as pleasantly surprised and quite keen to see what else the game will have to offer as it goes through development.\n\nFull review on The Reticule[thereticule.com]","March 5, 2014","true","30.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NikitaVR/recommended/230230/","NikitaVR","Nikita","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NikitaVR/","321 products in account","So where to start. Let's start with the end. Do I recommend Divinity: Original Sin? Absolutely. The game is absolutely magnificent and here is why:\n\nIt has been so long since I have played either a pen and paper rollplaying game or something like Baldur's Gate that I had forgotten how entertaining both used to be. Divinity: Original Sin is a throw back to those good'ol days.\n\nD:OS is very different from most of its contemporary peers, because it simply lets you play the way you want to play. No handholding. That means you'll be forced to "think". It is shocking at first, when you realise there are no quest markers and you are left to your own devices and you find yourself in front of a locked door. But then you discover that there is no predetermined way of breaching said door. You can talk to the NPC the door belongs to and he may give you the key. You can sneak in and steal the key, while your partner is distracting the NPC. You can kill the NPC and grab the key. IF the door is made out of wood, you can take an axe to it; or burn it down; or you may have a "magical unlock" skill and unlock the door without the key; or you if you don't have the magical skill, you can craft paper, out of wood and us a magical pen you have crafted to create a magical unlock scroll; or perhaps you have the "petpal" skill and talk to a rat that then shows you a back door; or maybe the door is not made out of wood and just iron bars and you can look into the room, then you can just teleport into it if you have the skill, or if you don't you can craft a scroll with the skill on it. I think you get the idea.  The amount of freedom and choices is simply staggering. Because of this it is best to enjoy this game with a friend. Someone you talk to on teamspeak so you can run ideas past each other. The game truly shines in 2-player COOP, provided you know the other person and communicate via audio. Don't bother with finding a random player through the lobby. While that is certainly possible as there are a looooot of people playing right now, I think your experience will be highly diminished.\n\nThe combat is fun. The magical elements behave "realistically", i.e Magicka on steroids. For example: You freeze some enemies with an ice wall. That leaves ice patches on the ground that you and the enemies can slip on. Someone shoots a fireball at it. The ice melts and leaves a puddle of water. You can then shoot lightning at the puddle and the water and everyone that touches the puddle get electrocuted and stunned. Shoot another fireball and the electrified puddle evaporates into an electrified cloud. Amazing fun.\n\nFinally, the story is actually pretty entertaining. The dialog doesn't take itself too seriously and at times is just flatout hilarious. And when you finish the game it feels like you have been partaking on a long epic journey. If you are like me and like to discover every inch of an open-world game then you'll be surprised by the size of the game world. My first play through took roughly 120 hours. Though I did start over after the first 10 hours, because I realized my skill choices where not complementing each other well. So that leaves me with around 110 hours for the first playthrough. Not bad for the price. And there still remains enough to be discovered so that a second playthrough is appealing to me.\n\nIf you like old school pen and paper or cRPGs like Baldur's Gate / Arcanum you will most likely love this game. If you expect to be guided through the game or expect something like Diablo 3 then you best stay way.","July 15, 2014","true","245.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Games that are incredibly fun, but require very little effort or attention to detail to complete; games that certainly show the hallmarks of an RPG, but lack the complete-formula and romance of the classic pen and paper dungeon crawler.\n\nThis game is a step in the right direction, and I look forward to giving Baldur's Gate another try after I've played through this 3 times or more.","July 3, 2014","true","70.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I had to recreate my characters 3 times to get what I felt like was a decent composition, but that was part of the fun since there's so much to choose from.  Of course part of the problem is you're setting a large amount of customization before you even see waht the world has to offer.\n\nSort of like Turn-based Diablo meets Dark Souls meets Baldur's Gate meets Dungeon Siege.\n\nLots of inventory management, lots of different things to customize, lots of challenging battles, lots of interesting combat situations.\n\nFor instance, if there is poison on the ground you can blow it up with fire, and you can then put oil on the fire to make a black smoke archers cannot see through.  You can make it rain and then chill someone in order to have a chance to freeze them.  You can use the rainwater to strengthen your electricity spells instead, etc etc etc.\n\nWorth a shot if you're into the genre.  If you're a super casual player, I'm not sure if I can recommend or not.","July 19, 2014","true","51.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It heavily encourages smart game play - use combinations like throwing a water based skill to get an enemy wet, then a cold based skill to freeze them, or poison then fire for explosions.  Lure the enemy into a river, then shock it with lightning for a truely devistating effect!\n\nThe 'normal' difficulty is a bit challenging at times - there is an easy mode to account for this, but it's more fun to actually figure out a better strategy until you can win!  Also, dont expect to get quests from people with bright icons over their head, and follow a waypoint to the end of the quest - this is a game you'll have to think, piece together the clues, and figure out the answers yourself (or with googles help, no judgement, we've all been there dont that at times).\n\nThe single player is a treat - 70 to 110+ hours (depending on your level of completionism) of "I'll just do ONE more thing then i'll go to bed" content.  What surprised me, though, was how much the multiplayer felt like the old days of sitting around a table playing pen and paper RPGs.\n\nVery enjoyable, had that special something reserved for games that other games in the genre will be compared to for years to come.","August 9, 2014","true","89.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Design a character from the ground up, choosing skills, feats and spells or opt to take one of the predefined classes. Manage a party of up to four using the slick team controls, or play online multiplayer with each of your friends designing and controlling a character. Conversations with NPCs and between party members are deep and impactful, with each individual being able to act seperately or even adventure seperately if compromise cannot be reached. Combat is turn based, but the Action Point system feels fast and responsive.\n\nThe very best part of this game however is the extensive modability. I have not seen an editor this well done since Warcraft 3, and already parts of the commuinity are stepping up to make campaigns to rival those of Neverwinter Nights 2.

Ultimately though, because this game is its own world, the reward for uncovering is great. There is so much freedom and independence in this game, it almost feels strange coming from a long line of games that hold your hand to the point it isnt exploration, its a tour. This game is not a guided tour. You’ll need to reload quick saves here and there, and might even lose progress up to 30min of play or more because of a surprise encounter or trap.\n\nBut! This game is outstanding. All of the above points only help to realize and flesh out the world.

It heavily encourages smart game play - use combinations like throwing a water based skill to get an enemy wet, then a cold based skill to freeze them, or poison then fire for explosions.  Lure the enemy into a river, then shock it with lightning for a truely devistating effect!\n\nThe 'normal' difficulty is a bit challenging at times - there is an easy mode to account for this, but it's more fun to actually figure out a better strategy until you can win!  Also, dont expect to get quests from people with bright icons over their head, and follow a waypoint to the end of the quest - this is a game you'll have to think, piece together the clues, and figure out the answers yourself (or with googles help, no judgement, we've all been there dont that at times).\n\nThe single player is a treat - 70 to 110+ hours (depending on your level of completionism) of "I'll just do ONE more thing then i'll go to bed" content.  What surprised me, though, was how much the multiplayer felt like the old days of sitting around a table playing pen and paper RPGs.\n\nVery enjoyable, had that special something reserved for games that other games in the genre will be compared to for years to come.","August 9, 2014","true","89.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It has its own rules and logic and not all of them are recognizable right away. At first, the game seems hard, and it almost is. It can be punishing to die, and frustrating to get stuck on a puzzle. Ultimately though, because this game is its own world, the reward for uncovering is great. There is so much freedom and independence in this game, it almost feels strange coming from a long line of games that hold your hand to the point it isnt exploration, its a tour. This game is not a guided tour. You’ll need to reload quick saves here and there, and might even lose progress up to 30min of play or more because of a surprise encounter or trap.\n\nBut! This game is outstanding. All of the above points only help to realize and flesh out the world. The sense of achievement you get when figuring out a difficult puzzle or beating a tough encounter is huge.

The single player campaign, played with up to four people, can last more than 100 hours. This serves as the tutorial for the game. Explore a new area with a kind stranger or get murdered and/or robbed of valuables. Develop strong friendships and create actual enemies.

Though the game looks fantastic, I would even go as far as saying one of the best in the genre, the core and mechanics stay true to it's source. The game is deep and will require dozens if not hundreds of hours from the player. If you are looking for a time sink, this one will do you just fine. The writing and story are equally as impressive as it's visuals. Characters are lively with humor and personality, and the narrative will draw you in with it's many incentives to role play.\n\nSince the game is so large in scope, I found it to be slow at the start. Not just pacing, but also in understanding. It took me a few re-rolls before I made a game that I was happy with, and even then it took me roughly 3-4 hours before I moved away from the dialog heavy town, and into the more actiony bits. Of course my persistent demand to talk to every single towns folk before leaving may have contributed to more time than needed, and only serve as testimony in how engrossing the writing can be. Also keep in mind, you need to be able to enjoy reading... a lot. There is only limited voice acting and the majority of the game is told in written form.\n\nOverall, the game is every thing I expected and more. It will probably go down as one of the great classics of our time.\n\nPros:\n- Excellent visuals and overall presentation\n- Deep mechanics\n- HUGE game\n- Lots of customization\n- Great writing\n- Classic return to form, for this style of RPG\n\nCons:\n- Slow to start (potentially).\n- Could prove too daunting for those who are short on free time.","August 15, 2014","true","56.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

If you want a baldurs gate 3 then complain to bioware...\n\nThe writing, the quests, how can you equip or use almost any items for something, pick-move-destroy almost everything, kill almost anyone, the open game (yes you can go anywhere but high level enemies will kill you in a second but it was like that even on divine divinity!)\n\nThe combat is very good, it is turn based, no more hack and slash which is a very good thing, you need to think on how to approach it not just lure the enemies one by one with a bow and then kill them.\n\nSave anywhere system!\n\nThe music is awesome as always!

I won't focus on bugs here. That's what the forums are for.\n\nThe Turn Based combat uses Action Points to dictate how much you can do in a single turn. This means a single turn could consist of an item use, special skill, and maybe a normal attack. You can also end your turn early to AP to allow more actions per turn. This greatly affects how you approach each fight. Additionally, each fight has the potential to be a completely unique experience with interactive elements. See an oil barrel? Attack it and oil spills out. Got some flaming arrows or a fire spell? Set the oil on fire and burn your enemies. Got a Rain spell? Put the fire out with rain. Have electricity? Shock enemies standing in water to electrify the ground. Ice can also be used to create slippery areas that can knock enemies (and players alike) down. There are a number of possibilities using single elements or a combination.\n\nParty members will actually interact with each other during certain conversations with NPCs. This leads into a back and forth between the characters you control. The outcome is a point increase in different social attributes. These help increase Luck, Charm, Leadership, Pickpocketing, etc. It's a pretty neat take on character development.\n\nInertacting with NPCs and the world is also quite enjoyable. Most NPCs can be talked to and bartered with. Objects like boxes and barrels can be looted, moved, or destroyed. Hanging hams or potion bottles sitting on tables that look like decoration can be stolen and used later in battles. Houses can be broken into and looted. NPCs can be attacked if you're feeling evil enough. Half of the time I have put in so far has been seeing what I can get away with around town and I will say there is a fair amount to do.\n\nCrafting, though not fully implemented, it pretty wonderful as well. Simple combinations of herbs and potions can yield a variety of new potions. A wooden club and nails nets you a spiked club, a knife and pumpkin gets you a jack-o-latern helmet, etc. Considering the number of items I have found labeled "Ingredient" I anticipate there being a number of recipes in future releases only adding to the things you can do.\n\nDOS also looks fantastic. Textures, shadows, and ambience are all quite well done. Colors are vibrant and plentiful. Fire singes the ground, ice covers the ground and melts away slowly, poison clouds linger in the air, blood pools and splashes when you walk through it. There is a lot to see and it's all quite enjoyable to look at.\n\nAll of this is packaged with Larian's off the wall humor seen in games like Divine Divinity or Beyond Divinity. I am incredibly excited to see this game when it's finished. Based on the devs hotfix coming out four days after the Alpha release, I am also excited to see this game evolve into its final state.","January 21, 2014","true","56.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Larian has done it right. Yes there are some bugs and things that still need perfecting in the mechanics, but this is ALPHA and its purpose is for players to find those bugs and report them for fixing. The Alpha gives you the first town an some surrounding area to explore and do a few quests in, but it's a pretty HUGE area with a lot of content and even a couple of little easter eggs that give you a good insight into what the rest of the game will be like to play through. There's plenty of combat encounters with nasty things for you to play around with the turn based combat mechanics and leveling your characters. It's not an Alpha you'll burn through in an hour! I played for around 15 hours and still didn't finish everything or go everywhere. Hell, the recently released Might & Magic X is at final release only about a 25 hour game for the same price... And frankly I'm pretty angry I bought the Alpha for that one at this point considering how limp the final release is.\n\nD:OS is for fans of Larian like myself, a long-anticipated game from a game developer with a history of quirky but addicting games and dedication to their playerbase. Divine Divinity (their first in this series) came out in 2002 and I bought it for myself for xmas that year and was instantly hooked. I had played Diablo so much I had actually worn out a couple of game CD's of it, but there'd been nothing since 1996 which had caught me quite the same till DivDiv came out, and I can honestly say if I put 500+ hours into Diablo, I must have over the years put 1000+ into DivDiv and have bought many copies of the game. I am actually working on another playthrough to keep myself occupied till D:OS comes out lol It's still to this day my favourite game.\n\nLarian's creative, fresh and cheeky style never grows old and has a great balance of a light hearted comedic RPG with some silly elements, but also a very deep and complex serious story with a vast world of politics and lore beneath it. The NPC's are lively and memorable, your own character conversation choices are full of personality and "life". I was very pleasently reminded of DivDiv when I played Dragon Age, it felt like they took a few pages out of Larian's book on crafting engaging conversation with humor and depth without losing the serious story side. And so far D:OS looks like it's solidly in the tradition, style & quality I would expect. If you like things like Douglas Adams, Monty Python and a little Tolkein & Game of Thrones mixed in, you will probably enjoy this game.\n\nAlthough there is a story which you're playing through, and technically you're on a rail to get to the end of it, you almost never feel like you are. You have great freedom to go where you want and kill who you want as well (which CAN screw you up, as you can kill people who are key to completing a quest! But that's your fault, you psychopath). If D:OS is like DivDiv then you will have dozens and dozens of side quests and places to explore which will keep you busy and add replay value as well. It's a little early to judge on that for sure, but Larian has been consistent in giving a lot of content in side quests in all of their other games so I feel like it's a fairly safe bet to be able to look forward to that.\n\nThe look and animation in the game is very pretty, the lighting is fantastic as well, I love using fireballs because they just look incredible and you can really see the blistering heat from them. So this is certainly a game which is very pleasing on the eyes. It's consistent with the look and feel of their previous games as well, so it still feels like you're in Rivellon!\n\nMovement is the biggest flaw that really stuck out to me during my playing so far. It's a bit clunky feeling right now and like your team is a little slow to respond when you give them a direction to move in and their progress when they do get going is a bit plodding especially when you want to run across a large section of the map.

Larian has done it right. Yes there are some bugs and things that still need perfecting in the mechanics, but this is ALPHA and its purpose is for players to find those bugs and report them for fixing. The Alpha gives you the first town an some surrounding area to explore and do a few quests in, but it's a pretty HUGE area with a lot of content and even a couple of little easter eggs that give you a good insight into what the rest of the game will be like to play through. There's plenty of combat encounters with nasty things for you to play around with the turn based combat mechanics and leveling your characters. It's not an Alpha you'll burn through in an hour! I played for around 15 hours and still didn't finish everything or go everywhere. Hell, the recently released Might & Magic X is at final release only about a 25 hour game for the same price... And frankly I'm pretty angry I bought the Alpha for that one at this point considering how limp the final release is.\n\nD:OS is for fans of Larian like myself, a long-anticipated game from a game developer with a history of quirky but addicting games and dedication to their playerbase. Divine Divinity (their first in this series) came out in 2002 and I bought it for myself for xmas that year and was instantly hooked. I had played Diablo so much I had actually worn out a couple of game CD's of it, but there'd been nothing since 1996 which had caught me quite the same till DivDiv came out, and I can honestly say if I put 500+ hours into Diablo, I must have over the years put 1000+ into DivDiv and have bought many copies of the game. I am actually working on another playthrough to keep myself occupied till D:OS comes out lol It's still to this day my favourite game.\n\nLarian's creative, fresh and cheeky style never grows old and has a great balance of a light hearted comedic RPG with some silly elements, but also a very deep and complex serious story with a vast world of politics and lore beneath it. The NPC's are lively and memorable, your own character conversation choices are full of personality and "life". I was very pleasently reminded of DivDiv when I played Dragon Age, it felt like they took a few pages out of Larian's book on crafting engaging conversation with humor and depth without losing the serious story side. And so far D:OS looks like it's solidly in the tradition, style & quality I would expect. If you like things like Douglas Adams, Monty Python and a little Tolkein & Game of Thrones mixed in, you will probably enjoy this game.\n\nAlthough there is a story which you're playing through, and technically you're on a rail to get to the end of it, you almost never feel like you are. You have great freedom to go where you want and kill who you want as well (which CAN screw you up, as you can kill people who are key to completing a quest! But that's your fault, you psychopath). If D:OS is like DivDiv then you will have dozens and dozens of side quests and places to explore which will keep you busy and add replay value as well. It's a little early to judge on that for sure, but Larian has been consistent in giving a lot of content in side quests in all of their other games so I feel like it's a fairly safe bet to be able to look forward to that.\n\nThe look and animation in the game is very pretty, the lighting is fantastic as well, I love using fireballs because they just look incredible and you can really see the blistering heat from them. So this is certainly a game which is very pleasing on the eyes. It's consistent with the look and feel of their previous games as well, so it still feels like you're in Rivellon!\n\nMovement is the biggest flaw that really stuck out to me during my playing so far. It's a bit clunky feeling right now and like your team is a little slow to respond when you give them a direction to move in and their progress when they do get going is a bit plodding especially when you want to run across a large section of the map. That can get pretty time consuming and the pathing for your party members when they're following you when you've selected a direction to run in can be a bit problematic, considering how slow the movement is it's surprisingly easy to loose one or two of them while you're travelling.\n\nI'll be reporting the movement issues - I'll be honest and say it isn't enough to stop me playing even if that doesn't change for final release, but it is frustrating and I can totally see it stopping others from playing.\n\nI really haven't seen much else that stands out to me as a flaw worth mentioning in a review of an Alpha stage release, yes there are a few bugs, but I'm sure they will be fixed if reported.\n\nWith the exception of Starbound I haven't been this thrilled with my player experience with a game I backed in Alpha release.

I absolutely fall in love with rich worlds, well crafted lore, unique NPCs, and a certain amount of freedom with character creation (both in gameplay and personality).  While their have been many pretenders to the throne to this old school theory of game development and the general meta-game has shifted toward action based RPG's Larian Studios has restored my faith with Divinity Original Sin.\n\nI've been playing through the comabt and avoiding the story as much as possible but what accidental bits i've discovered and the combat has me very excited for the full release.  To say i've bought into the hype is a bit of an understatement.  I'm actively drinking the kool-aid at this point.\n\nThis is going to be one of those games you wake up on the weekend and make yourself a cup of coffee while playing co-op with one of your old gaming friends.  There will be pauses between dialogue choices as you decided how you want to respond and several minute long planning sessions on how to engage a tough fight (see the 4 elemental demon bosses early on.  We fought them at lvl 4 and won but it did take a little bit of planning).\n\nI'll give a more solid review when the game is fully released as i've been reading that launch has been delayed for voice acting (MOTHER OF GOD, YES!) and the same company and actors from dragon commander are doing the voices.  For the uninformed, Dragon Commander has some very solid voice acting and helped sell the world and general atmosphere of the game.  I have complete faith that a return of the actors from Dragon Commander will be an incredible experience ontop of something i'm already looking forward to.  (i also have a schoolyard crush on the actress that did Ophelia's voice in Dragon Commander, Here's hoping she does voices for Original Sin too)\n\nBut my general reccomendation is to buy this game.  If you're a twitch gaming kind of guy then save your money for something more to your taste but if you like RPG's, stategy games, Pen/Paper DND, tactical turn-based combat, and any variations of those core game elements then this game is absolutely for you.","June 20, 2014","true","98.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

If you want a baldurs gate 3 then complain to bioware...\n\nThe writing, the quests, how can you equip or use almost any items for something, pick-move-destroy almost everything, kill almost anyone, the open game (yes you can go anywhere but high level enemies will kill you in a second but it was like that even on divine divinity!)\n\nThe combat is very good, it is turn based, no more hack and slash which is a very good thing, you need to think on how to approach it not just lure the enemies one by one with a bow and then kill them.\n\nSave anywhere system!\n\nThe music is awesome as always! (kudos to Mr Kirill Pokrovsky)\n\nThe graphics are now full 3d and they are very good, I'm one of those person who still prefer 2d pre-render backgrounds like divine divinity but still the graphics are awesome.\n\nMany puzzles to solve, nice dialogs with a good plot too, and there is even voice acting for the main characters and some npc.\n\nLots of skills and spells to use, a true rpg to discover :)\n\nSo overall this game is fantastic maybe you will want to wait a little bit more before playing it because it's still a little buggy but they are patching the game very often but dont get me wrong, right now the game is playable, very much playable, it's not like a beta version if that's what you are thinking or someone said on the forum but like a I said little things here and there, but then again it's a big game with a lot of stuffs so it is to be expected.\n\nAll in all a 9/10 game.","July 2, 2014","true","10.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The story is a bit hit and miss but it has its moments and has plenty of the good old Larian studios humour mixed in.\n\n\nThe world is really immersive and beautifully designed props to the art team loads of hidden items treasure secret caves underground caverns so if you like exploring you will love the adventure you will have in this game and the game has plenty of side quests that will get you out there in the world.\n\n\nNow while I appreciate the way the devs did the navigation and quest layouts I can see some people maybe having a bit of trouble finding their way around initially, the game does sort of throw you in the deep end and if you have never played games such as Baldurs Gate or Neverwinter it could be a bit overwhelming. This game doesn't have a press a button to see where you need to go or a massive arrow pointing to the quest objective you have to take the time to read the quests and listen to what the NPCs tell you in the game or you will find yourself lost.\n\n\nThe start of the game is a bit slow and I could see some people getting bored but stick with it once you get out of the first town and get exploring the game really picks up and gets its hooks into you  :)\n\nIt's a yes from me on this one guys if you  love adventure and exploring beautifully crafted worlds get this one bought ASAP.\n\nP.s no I am not in the mood for cheese -_-","August 16, 2014","true","70.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

Though the game looks fantastic, I would even go as far as saying one of the best in the genre, the core and mechanics stay true to it's source. The game is deep and will require dozens if not hundreds of hours from the player. If you are looking for a time sink, this one will do you just fine. The writing and story are equally as impressive as it's visuals. Characters are lively with humor and personality, and the narrative will draw you in with it's many incentives to role play.\n\nSince the game is so large in scope, I found it to be slow at the start. Not just pacing, but also in understanding. It took me a few re-rolls before I made a game that I was happy with, and even then it took me roughly 3-4 hours before I moved away from the dialog heavy town, and into the more actiony bits. Of course my persistent demand to talk to every single towns folk before leaving may have contributed to more time than needed, and only serve as testimony in how engrossing the writing can be. Also keep in mind, you need to be able to enjoy reading... a lot. There is only limited voice acting and the majority of the game is told in written form.\n\nOverall, the game is every thing I expected and more. It will probably go down as one of the great classics of our time.\n\nPros:\n- Excellent visuals and overall presentation\n- Deep mechanics\n- HUGE game\n- Lots of customization\n- Great writing\n- Classic return to form, for this style of RPG\n\nCons:\n- Slow to start (potentially).\n- Could prove too daunting for those who are short on free time.","August 15, 2014","true","56.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Staple mechanics are here (lock picking, pyramid teleporters, crafting food and potions by collecting ingredients out in the world), some of which are recognisably the classic Div Div systems (the skill-up system is pleasingly familiar, whilst also being greatly expanded), and some of which are fresh new additions.\n\nPerhaps best of all for series fans, the lore, setting and characters are all intact. The Legion are around in their various garrisons and forts, Arhu is on-hand to dispense wisdom and advice, and, of course, the Source is present and correct (or  rather, corrupt).\n\nBeyond Div's simultaneous 2 character system works even better in OS. In fact, it's chalk and cheese, and any painful memories you may have of that game's controls, or the notorious Fergus will be wiped away. Your group can be split up and easily managed just by dragging the portraits around, so no worries there.\n\nI never thought isometric RPGs could get better than Div Div, but OS takes the crown.","October 7, 2014","true","13.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bruceangus/recommended/230230/","bruceangus","Bruce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bruceangus/","184 products in account","This game can be very difficult at first. The world and gameplay are very detailed, and the game doesn't really act like most games in helping you along. This learning curve can be very intimidating when you first start playing, and actually had me put the game down after a few hours, thinking I would never pick it back up. Boy am I glad I did. All of those reasons that make it so difficult to start make it so rewarding once you can some momentum.\n\nOne of my favorite all time games is Baldur's Gate 2. That game was so professionally crafted, and although it was an open-world RGP on the surface, it doubled as a complex strategy game. Unlike most games of today, the encounters were not levelled. That meant you could walk into an encounter with enemies at a much higher level than your character. Of course, you would probably be eviscerated in your attempt to just get out alive. Then after you reloaded your game, you would be obsessed at beating that challenge. You would try different spells, buy different equipment, try sneaking and backstabbing, different spells and scrolls, you would do anything possible to win. The game was amazingly open to your creative solutions, and once you finally found a strategy that looked like it worked, you would be exhilarated. I loved that about that game more than anything. While I have loved games like Skyrim since then, I have still never experienced anything quite like that since.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin may be the most worthy successor to Baldurs Gate 2 I have seen. The RPG elements are different. It takes more of an Elder Scrolls type style, where you can choose to start from base classes, but leveling up doesn't have class restrictions. You can start as a thief, then start learning spells. You can be an archer that knows water based spells, or a assassin that knows witchcraft. its more closer to the spirit of the 4th edition of D&D than advanced dungeons and dragons. Overall I think that works well. There are many choices to make that create nuanced changes to your gameplay.\n\nThe setting and world is very detailed, but feels like a much smaller scale than Baldur's Gate 2. Though you can enter every building and talk and trade with every character.\n\nThe game really excels in its combat. Everything works together and can be used strategically. You can put out fires with a Rain spell, you can light oil on fire to burn your enemies. You can shock everyone standing in a pool of water, you can blow up poison gas. You get up to four party members, and can make each of their skills compliment each other. My one buddy will often lay an oil slick on the ground to have my thief ignite with his flame spells(yes my thief is a pyrotechnic wizard). My actual wizard will often teleport an enemy close to my buddy's bruiser warrior character for quick dispatchment. There are a million and one different ways to approach a battle and we often lose miserably on a first encounter, only to eventually succeed after careful planning. There aren't many encounters you can really take for granted. There are probably less enemy encounters than in other games, but each one is hard fought and feels dynamic. Essentially, this is as far from a hack and slash game you can possibly have.\n\nIn typical D:OS fashion, the crafting/inventory/item collection aspects are richly detailed and not explicitly explained. Its indicative of every aspect of the game. Most of the time it feels like a developer is trying to point out ever single part of their game in an effort to demonstrate how much time it took to create it. Larian Studios is so absurdly casual about crafting one the most dense games in decades. We were basically ignoring cracting entirely until my partner found a  Guidebook[www.divinityoriginalsin.com] online. I thought all that stuff we were picking up was just meaningless stuff to sell. Needless to say, we are pretty excited to jump back into the game and try some of that stuff out.\n\nI don't have many complaints about the game, but I have some differences of opinions. Mainly, I wish that this was 4 player, considering that you can have 4 party members. Also, we my friend hosts our game, and the save files aren't accessible to me at all. I don't really own the characters I play with, its like he just grants me control while we play together. We also end up fighting over chests a little more than I like. Some recent games like Deathtrap brought some appreciated sharing of treasure. In D:OS, we tend to greedily race to the dropped loot after a battle and walk into traps looking for chests.","March 18, 2015","true","53.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It was definitely difficult to figure out where to get started.  My friend and I died quite a few times just testing out which enemies we could even survivie against in the early stages.  But it has already beens do rewarding.  Once the momentum started rolling we could hardly stop playing.  Game is a ton of fun and the co-op aspect just puts it over the top.  Thus far this game has provided me with nothing short of thrilling turn based combat.\n\nMy main gripe so far: inconsistent multiplayer connecting.  Once it gets started it is fine, but my friend and I are baffled as to why the connection fails so often.  We put hours into figuring this out and... it still fails *all* the god damned time.  I'm not bad with his stuff: I have dealt with many convoluted and broken multiplayer systems; I have hosted my own servers for games. The online multiplayer struggles are a black eye on what has otherwise been, as I said above, an awesome rpg experience.\n\nAnyway, still highly recommend it but I hope that the devs get these connection issues sorted.","July 22, 2014","true","81.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Interesting combat system, good story line, and never a dull moment.\n\nPROS\n+ Not a single "fetch" quest. Seriously, about 100 quests and not a single one of them falls into the "go get me 10 pairs of smelly panties" category.\n+ Excellent graphics with bright colors, excellent level of detail, atmospheric nuances, weather, terrain, all very beautiful to watch.\n+ Interesting, innovative, detailed and hard to master combat system. When "fight" is on, solid tactics are essential.\n+ Lots of content, areas to explores, NPCs. D:OS' world is very much alive and full of detail. A single, completist playthrough is well over 100 hours.\n+ Humor galore. Easter eggs, puns, funny remarks everywhere. For the first time ever I even paid attention to "achievements", each one a nod to some more or less obscure rock track (Sleeping Village, Disciples of the Watch and No More Mr Nice Guy among my favs).\n+ Appropriate sound track, not invasive, you won't feel the need to turn it off.\n+ Game is very polished, in 150 hours i've encountered just one, quite minor, graphic glitch.\n\nCONS\n- Characters are devoid of any real personality: voice overs are sparse, character build doesn't help, you don't really get attached to your main character as you would have done with Origins, or ME's Shepard, or even with Baldur's Gate. You get stronger and stronger, but you don't "grow".\n- The UI would need an overhaul, inventory management is tedious and a time waster.\n- Some quests are too obscure and counter intuitive, if you really want to complete everything you will need to go check a walkthrough from time to time unless you enjoy pixel-hunting for a semi invisible knob or switch.","February 25, 2015","true","131.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I originally go this in Early Access and fell in love.  This game is NOT for you if you want a game to hold your hand and give you quests like "go kill 10 wolves".  This game is NOT for you if you don't want to actually have to think in order progress in the game.\n\nThe editor alone is worth the price of the game.  The fact that you get the game and the editor is stupid good.  This company basically made an A+ engine and then gave it away with the game.  In my opinion they could've easily held onto it and released DLC campaigns.  Instead they decided to give them to the community.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDarkStorm/recommended/230230/","TheDarkStorm","๖ۣۜR3BORN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDarkStorm/","346 products in account","Divinity: Original Sin is another masterful entry into the critically acclaimed Divinity Universe from the wonderful Larian Studios!\n\nDivinity: Original Sin follows in the footsteps of it's predecessors, throwing the player into a magnificiently crafted world full of character intrigue, mystery, betrayal and hope. The story plot is free-flowing, allowing for "maximum" freedom in the choices one can make (and although it works quite well at the best of times), it often requires moments of linear gameplay in order to avoid stalls, glitches, etc. The written script is intelligent, often subtle in humour and philosophy. Character customization is similiar to previous titles, allowing for the greatest degree of freedom in hybrid builds and mashups of class types. Combat takes a different turn, heading towards turn based battles - although free movement exists outside of combat. Again, almost all items in the game world can be stolen, found, bartered or sold. Crafting requires a solid memory, as the instructions for craftables are found within lore books, often in rhyme and poetry. Divinity boasts memorable characters, easter eggs and references (in one instance a solid, yet humourful, recommendation to buy Dragon Commander)...\n\nOriginal Sin's visuals are not spectacular, but unique and arresting to the eye. Colors are bright and vivid, spell effects are often satisfying, and character animations are smooth and fluent. The music of Original Sin is a fantastic element, as composer Kirill Pokrovsky comes aboard once more, delivering a beautiful, atmospheric soundtrack as befits the games style. The mechanics are well implemented and reactive, as you can create hazardous surfaces of fire, ice or slime with combinations of the elements. The content is satisfying (even the semi-pointless Golden Grail and Zandalors Trunks). The UI is simple to follow, the controls easy to master. Character voice overs are rare, but professional in tone and fluency of language. Multiplayer boasts an interesting concept of drop in/drop out gameplay, as the host of any game has complete control over the progression of all characters - only allowing for drop-in players to progress in the campaign, influencing little change over the character controlled.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin is a magnificient title from a wonderful developer, and is absolutely well worth the money and time for those who enjoy tactical RPG experiences with freedom of choice!","May 1, 2015","true","100.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

One of the few games I've been excited to get home and play in a long time.\n\nThere are certainly many things that can be improved, but given that this is a beta, it is expected. Nevertheless, the number of positives in the game greatly outweigh the negatives, and I'm very excited to see the final product.\n\nHighly recommend if you enjoy old school rpg/strategy games. This game feels like Baldur's Gate meets any other strategy rpg without the hex-based combat.","May 11, 2014","true","30.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deexil/recommended/230230/","deexil","ಠ_ಠ Exil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deexil/","258 products in account","Now that the game is released I can share my thoughts and experience with it and hopefully help someone make the choice if this game is for them or not.\n\nI bought the game during its early access stage and completed the first portion it had (25% of the total game) for two times, then fiddled with it after each major update and I have to say that the game has evolved quite nicely, much better than I thought it would be.\n\nThe final version is great and works. I have heard of people experiencing some problems (or finding bugs), I've yet to find anything however so I won't say that its bug free or otherwise.\n\nBut how is the game itself? First of all, this is not your standard RPG like Diablo or Skyrim, its much more tactical. Think back to games like Dungeon Siege 1 where you had a party and each battle depended on the action you told each member to take, it depends on how you approach the battle and how well prepared you are.\n\nAt the same time the game does not hold your hands at all. You have a quest book which gives you information about what you need to do but most of the time it won't tell you where to go directly. It will however give you hints and its up to you to find out how you can complete the quest. This is much more refreshing since it opens up the world a lot, it makes you think and revisit people and places to get more clues and ultimately complete the quest. Overall, once the quest is completed it feels so much more rewarding.\n\nThe game is also pretty much open world. Its not as open world as Skyrim for example but its so much more than Diablo, meaning that its not a linear experience of going to point B from point A but at the same time those points exist. Its up to you how you get from one point to another and especially when you go. No one said you can't go from point A to point G from the get go, just be ready to face some strong opponents on your way.\n\nThe NPC's in the game (friendly) are also very alive, they won't just sit idle while you steal from them, or rob their house. You can steal everything you want, just don't expect them to sit quietly and watch you take it all away. First they will stop you, then they will call the quards which in turn will land you in jail (if you do not stop stealing). But that doesn't mean the game forbids you from being an ♥♥♥ to the world. As long as no one sees you, steal as much as you like (since its so damn rewarding).\n\nFinally, the combat. Like I said in a previous paragraph, its a call back to the older games. The combat is turn based. You and your enemies take turns on hitting each other. You have a set about of Action points (AP) that you can use to do various things like moving, attacking, healing and so on. Once you run out of AP its time to end your turn and let the enemy do his thing.\n\nBecause of this turn based system the game feels much more fresh and at the same time much more harder (which is very good for this title). One mistake might cost you the lives of a team member or your own (thankfully you can revive them as long as you have a ressurection scroll). Play your cards right and you will win battles with ease...you just need to pay close attention and think before acting.\n\nI personally recommend the game to RPG fans, especially those that loved the games of old and even more to the new people that haven't had the chance to try one of the old games due to various reasons.","June 30, 2014","true","54.0"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

So I will give you with the bit I've played my first impressions with what I think is good and bad.\n\nSince I got it I haven't been able to get out of it... in a good way.  I'm totally addicted and found the game that suits me to the max.  This is turn based, so it gives me time to think without pressure yet still sitting on the edge of my seat at the fight.\n\nIt kind of threw me in the beginning though on character creation because I didn't know it was a duo... I was quite perplexed when I had to create two and customize them. (again I've never played any of the earlier ones so not even sure if that is how they worked in those)  But the whole two character thing had be curious right off the bat.  I figured it was basicly like a skyrim of a different flavor, story, etc etc.  But it isn't and it is!  For me, it's perfect.  It guides you along at the beginning yet gives you freedom to experiment and explore to start you out.  Perfectly balanced in my opinion for a brand new person.  They are great at the queues you need to not salp you in the face eyt pop up at the perfect time with suggestions.  They aren't obnoxious at all, but definitely letting you know about a new feature.\n\nI think it is an amazing and creative touch about the dialogs you have that affect the game between your two characters that you choose how it goes.  There are different options.   They really thought out of the box on this one.  I'm an animator for the film TV and gaming industries and not much impresses me. But this one did.\n\nthe only negative thing I can say about it is the camera.  though it's not hard to get the hang at all on rotating it, they put a limit on it severely so you have to zoom in to see through walls at times, which is a feature of the game, not a bug.  It just messes up my immersion a wee bit, but i'm sure I will get used to it soon enough.\n\nI just love the barter / selling / buying system a LOT.  items are as good as gold and visa versa.  it took me a couple times to realize I could switch between the characters in the same selling / bartering menu, but it's something that isn't hidden at all either.\n\nI could go on and on about it but in a nut shell, it's just amazing and I'm totally addicted and that is a huge feat to do with my line of work.\n\nCreate an awesome day and kudos to the awesome creativity to the devs.  it is totally worth the price!\n\n~ ish","November 12, 2014","true","19.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

So far, this alpha build is already a good representation of what I expect from an RPG, having played games such as Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and other Black Isle games in the day.  This game, to me, is a modern adaptation, with mechanics, of the RPG-style game I played back then.  The option to discuss amongst the party and shape the personalities of the characters is a great feature to enhance the immersion.

The odds are quite a bit and this game will really show that. It's pretty refreshing to not have a quest marker, GPS tracker, arrow guidance or any quest helpers other then a detailed journal and common directional sense. It's actually funny how simple tasks without these crutches can now cause confusion and maybe embarassment or frustration.\n\nDivinity Original Sin will allow you to once again be actually mentally engaged in the game in order to do progression rather then drudging through it like a undead. Speaking of undead there are plenty of them as the Soure Hunter you are you will be battling a lot of them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/glazedkoala/recommended/230230/","glazedkoala","Molten Tomato","http://steamcommunity.com/id/glazedkoala/","82 products in account","This was my first PC RPG, so my review is without any nostalgia for this type of gameplay. And I loved the game. It wasn't perfect -- at times some things enfuriated me (backstabbing related usually), but overall it was amazing. I was obsessed. I still am.\n\nThe good:\n1. The battle system is great. There's a lot to think about and reason to pay careful attention to what enemies are doing on their turn. The game can be very hard, so optimizing your moves and performing smart combinations matter.  Magic spells can interact with each other in really rad ways.\n2. There are a lot of ways to complete quests, but it is still challenging to complete them.\n3. Non-combat skills feel very important! Crafting, being able to talk to animals, teleportation -- all of these and more can help a lot.  With a high enough pickpocket talent you can steal from anybody in the game (who has items to trade, such as all shop keepers).\n4. SO MUCH TO DO in every town! It really encourages exploration and does a good job of rewarding you.\n5. Side stories and quests can be very interesting and funny.\n6. The coop is well implemented. There are fun dialogs you can argue with your partner in. And it makes exploring towns go much faster when you split up.\n\nThe bad:\n1. I've heard people say the UI for this game is good. It's not. This must be a "compared to other PC RPGS" thing.  Your inventory will be a mess without enough good options for organization. Crafting can be a real pain because of this. Dragging an item through your inventory page by page is annoying. You can look at "only ingredients" in your inventory, but this doesn't help when you need to combine an ingredient with a weapon. I got around this by dragging things into pouches for crafting.\n2. The learning curve is a bit rough, especially with certain classes. I hated my Rogue for his first 6 levels or so. Part of the problem is that there isn't a very good UI for backstabbing.  Enemies stand in all sorts of weird poses, so it's not always obvious where their back is -- you can waste a lot of action points trying to find an enemies back.\n3. SO MUCH TO DO it can be overwhelming. Especially in the first town. It's best to just explore each town fully then leave the town only when you find you must (especially the first town, as you can level up a lot without leaving it).\n4. People can be pretty wordy. Especially Jahan. He likes to use a lot of words to say some lofty stuff that basically isn't interesting.\n5. It can be hard to follow dialog if you aren't the one being talked to (when playing coop). You don't get to see the normal dialog screen, instead it flashes above the NPC talking. Since NPCs like to use a lot of words regardless of what they are saying, often there's no time to read it. You can follow in a special dialog menu, but it's annoying to have to do that.","August 5, 2014","true","90.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Probably my first computer gaming experience was Ultima VII. I never finished it. It was too long, I was too young, and it was too hard to get games to run in the first place back then (memory managers? who remembers that crap?). It has, in the rouchly 25 years of gaming since then, been my white whale. I think about it constantly and long to play it again and finally finish it.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin captures so much of what made that game great to me, and so much of what simply doesn't exist in gaming today. It shines creatively, both in a refreshing take on stats/classes/skills/etc, as well as the story. I personally found the graphics to be very good as well. Art is a purely subjective thing to discuss, and I won't say that this game is for everyone. But I will say, if you want a deep role playing experience, turn-based combat, and a pool of nostalgia deep enough to drown in, this is the game for you.","July 12, 2014","true","24.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/metadigital/recommended/230230/","metadigital","Metadigital","http://steamcommunity.com/id/metadigital/","132 products in account","It's been a long time since I've played an old school RPG of this quality. I highly recommend it to RPG fans! Here is my breakdown:\n\nTHINGS THIS GAME DOES RIGHT\n\nCustomization - Instead of setting the length and thickness of your character's nose, you get options that matter, like choosing skills, talents, and stats which add up to make your own custom class. Of course, you can pick from a default list and build it however you want if you prefer. This is customization done right.\n\nDifficulty - This game will kill you. It's not Dark Souls hard, but it's hard enough to give you a sense of satisfcation when overcomingits challenges.\n\nNon-linearity - Aspects of this game are non-linear. Ultimately it does have a linear narrative, but you can almost completely freely explore the world. You're limited mostly by your level, which is the main barrier limiting progression.\n\nGrinding - Most RPGs allow you (or force you) to gain excessive amounts of experience to out-level the game's content. That is the fundamental principle of the JRPG. This game only gives you enough experience to survive the next challenge which ensures that the difficulty of the game is more fine tuned and harder to trivialize.\n\nPuzzles - Not everything is explicitly a puzzle. Sometimes advancing the story is a puzzle in itself (like the old adventure games). Sometimes a combat has puzzle elements. Sometimes it's just a room full of traps. Either way, there's almost always a problem to figure out.\n\nTHINGS YOU MAY OR MAY NOT LIKE\n\nSpeed of Play - This is a slow methodical game best spent enjoyed at a leisurely pace. The turn based combat, sprawling maps, and slower paced movement speed means that it'll take hours to progress through what some may consider a small amount of content. For the perceptive and the patient, though, that content has a lot to offer.\n\nTone - It's a fairly straight forward fantasy setting. It's fun, whimsical, and self aware at times. It doesn't get overly dark nor overly comical. It's not too geneteric or creative. It serves primarily as a backdrop for the gameplay.\n\nCo-op Dialogue - You can do rock-paper-scissors to overcome disagreements. What you choose impacts your stats in small ways. Min-maxers beware. Everyone else; have fun.\n\nRandom Loot - This has pros and cons. On the one hand, each playthrough is different. On the otherhand, a lot of loot sucks. It's debatable whether or not random loot works in a game with a limited pool of enemies.\n\nNietzsche - He can join your party. It's pretty neat if you're in to that sort of thing. The devs didn't actually name him Nietzsche, but you'll figure it out if you went through that phase in your teen years.\n\nTHINGS YOU PROBABLY WONT LIKE\n\nOops - It can be easy to make it hard or impossible to progress in the game by killing an NPC, letting them get killed, or just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ them off enough. Same goes for accidently clicking on an object or walking into a room that causes the entire town to aggro on you. Save often.\n\nBugs - There's still quite a number of bugs, but they are very quickly being addressed. Still, be warned. Save often.","July 10, 2014","true","56.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reggaenomics/recommended/230230/","Reggaenomics","Petro Poroshenko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reggaenomics/","323 products in account","I won't go into some long summary of the game. Watch the videos and read the info to find out what the game is about.\n\nPros:\n\nDepth - The game has a vast amount of creativity behind it, and you just feel like you're playing a very deep game the moment you start. The fact that your companions interact with each other is brilliant and adds a nice Role play element for those who want it, or a chance to ♥♥♥♥ around with a buddy's character for those that want to laugh. Each quest feels and plays differently than the next, and there are some quests in this game that just surprise you with how... different they are to the norm.\n\nCombat - While I'm not the biggest turn-based fan, I heavily enjoy the combat sequences of this. Everything looks and sounds dramatic, and the risk of death is high. Even if you're on easy, if you don't have the right class pairings, you'll get smoked and there's no coming back from the dead spare a ressurection scroll (they're pretty pricey too). Thus far I'm only level 7 or 8 but I have more than a toolbar of spells, and each spell has a unique spin to it (I'm a Wizard or something if it wasn't obvious) from the silly teleport which moves the enemy from their location to another location several feet in the air causing massive damage from falling (and to anyone you put them near - definitely a strategic spell if done right) to an AoE boulder which throws poison on the ground for added damage. Don't forget my Ice Elemental for a free tank that you don't have to worry about it dying. However, be wary of boss battles. They are HARD\n\nGeneral Gameplay - Combat is one thing, but how do you play the rest of the time? Well, you are given a lot of freedom with what you do. That barrel that you think is silly? Move it elsewhere, or shoot an ice ball at it. That door that is locked? Pickpocket the owner for the key, or shoot an ice ball at it. Some shop keeper has some nice plates on display? Turn into a barrel with sneak mode and steal them away, but don't shoot ice balls at them because shop keepers don't like their stuff getting ice balled. I have a lot of fun just running around a village because I can do whatever I want and the game isn't needlessly punishing for shooting ice balls at things. Just don't hit anyone and don't steal their stuff in front of them and you won't normally get the guards (who are very strong).\n\nSettings - While the raw graphics are subpar, the actual look of the game is colorful and fun. In the first few hours of the game I've gone from a "placcid" beach, to the first city of the game, to the woods north of the city, and then to a lava and zombie filled graveyard east of the city. Did I mention I'm still on the very first main quest and I'm only level 7? Unless the game ends off the first (and thus last) quest, you're in for a plethora of places to explore and a lot of game to be had for only 40 dollars.\n\nHowever that ends the positives - things this game does better than other games. What does it do that's standard?\n\nGraphics - as I said they're subpar. They're not bad by any means. They don't take you out of the game, they just aren't great. Villagers only show up when you're nearby, textures are mostly decent with some that are iffy and some that are downright awful (looking at you tree leaves) but you only notice bad textures normally when you're zoomed in more than default. So don't do that and you're fine I guess. There really isn't a Graphics configuration, just presets. Disappointing. But it's not a terribly ordeal and as I said the visuals are not hindered by the raw graphics. Everything is colorful and has life, so I leave this as not a con but not a pro.\n\nVoicing - There is a decent amount of voice work, but the game isn't anywhere near fully voiced. There's a lot of dialogue you get through, so it's to be expected. Regardless, there are MMOs now that are fully voiced, so it's not a good thing. However, I leave it out of the cons because the voices they do have are fun (I've gotten a laugh out of some of the things villagers say and how animals will have normal voice clips) and your characters will voice out a decent amount of lines for you. Adds to the feel of the game.\n\nLeads me to the cons of the game now.\n\nLoot - For a game where I'm constantly  going on about how big it is, there certainly is a lack of loot. And that rather surprises me. For a game where the point of it is to have two+ companions, you only ever get one or two things from even big bosses. You mostly only get basic equipment and potions from loot. There isn't a very high risk/reward for exploring caves when all I get is a staff I have to turn in for a quest (and the staff isn't even that good to start). Coming from Path of Exile, a free game, I'm more than a little disappointed by the lack of loot. However, take this with a grain of salt as I'm a loot ♥♥♥♥♥ and will go out of my way to get the best loot.\n\nCustomization - The RPG elements are decent in that you can level up your character however you please. However, you are rather limited with how they look. Very few hair options, just as many face options, a dozen or so skin options, male and female human only (in a fantasy game with demons and undead and orcs in the first 10 minutes?) no facial hair options they only pair with faces (so the only way to get a beard is to use the specific face that has one), and that's about it for customization. It's just disappointing. I feel this part of the game was just an afterthought. "Oh I guess we should have some choices for how their character looks." Well it's one of the best parts of an RPG for me, and so I feel left out in the cold. Also, an annoying feature is how your avatar's picture is chosen, not reflective. That means you will not look like your avatar's picture. You can come close if you customize them the way it looks in the picture, but often times you want to branch out (as there's not a lot of choices for pictures) and thus you're left with a picture that is not very reflective of your actual character. Weird choice, I have to say.\n\nMultiplayer - When I have to mod in order to play the game the way I want to, and when that mod works perfectly with what I wanted, I again get that "Gee I think this was an afterthought" feel. What were the devs thinking with this multiplayer choice? Only two players? You can have four people with you, so why am I limited to two real humans with me? Don't worry, a mod fixes that for you. And the fact that it's so seamless makes me feel a bit annoyed. Why is it so easy for a mod to make the game playable with a group of friends? Why is it not like this to start? And then there's the fact that you can't bring your character(s) with you to adventure. You are stuck with the characters in the game that were there from the start. Yes, if I beat the game and then join my friend as he loads up the game for the first time, it will be unfair. But that should be our choice. What happens when I leave? How about make it so he has to have his two characters, but when I bring my character over it functions much like a mercenary (like Jahan) so when I bail, he isn't stuck with my character, or he isn't just left in the cold alone. Considering the fact that FourPlay (four player mod) makes it so there's a possible six players, and the game does not in the slightest break because of it, I think something could have been worked out.\n\nAll in all, I love this game. I will continue putting time in it as the pros are all very important features that make or break a game. The cons, while they're important, are not life and death. The game is $40 well spent, and I simply write all of this crap out to vent out what I want for the game in the future, whether it's in this game or in other games. Mods fix one of my cons for the most part (even if I can't bring over my own characters to another's game) so this game is definitely a must-buy. I hope it leads to more.","August 12, 2014","true","24.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I... well, I can't really put it into words. Many people compare this to old-school RPGs like Neverwinter Nights, Baldur's Gate, and Ultima, and while I can honestly say I see the homage quite clearly, D:OS introduces many new concepts too. Co-op works seamlessly and flawlessly, the editor is great, and I can't wait to see what modders do with this game. My only main complaint about the game is the inventory system - it's a little clunky and hard to navigate at times, especially when you have a lot of items. The writing is clever and humorous, and I just found myself reading books and immersing myself in the world for hours on end - and I continue to do so as I play through the game.\n\nSo, how do you know if this game is for you? Honestly, if you've enjoyed any old-school isometric RPGs in the past (or currently), chances are that you'll enjoy this game. For a newcomer to the genre of CRPGs? Watch a couple videos, if you have friends who personally like the game, shoot them a message and ask them why it's great. I also realize it's a pretty hefty price tag, but I honestly think it's worth it - especially with all that comes shipped with the game.","August 2, 2014","true","66.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It does have issues: often times it'll be hard to see where the edges of ground effects (fire, poison, etc.) are, especially if they're covered by grass. This has resulted in my characters taking unnecessary damage more times than I can count. Often times your character's vision will also be blocked for no reason, which can be frustrating. However, these issues are only minor and I expect they will be patched out in the near future.\n\nThe story is engaging and the quests are mostly interesting, but unfortunately (or fortunately if you're like me) there's barely any voice acting. That is forgivable, though, as the game has a gigantic amount of dialogue. If you like reading, just buy the game already!\n\nOne additional point I must bring up is the fact that the game starts off in a slow-ish manner. My friend and I were not very impressed by the combat system at the very beginning of the game, but it gets SO MUCH better after a few hours once you start getting more and more abilities to play around with.\n\nTo summarize: the game is very good, but not perfect. 100% recommended if you're into cRPGs, otherwise you might want to read around a bit more to make sure that the game is for you.","July 3, 2014","true","21.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The age before Diablo's success spawned a new type of RPG with the most important element removed or given a back seat - THE STORY! Not to mention a watered down version of RPG combat - the button mash.\n\nThis game is nostalgic. It leaves me with a good feeling just thinking about returning to the game, and experiencing it with the attention and thought that it was designed for. There is great attention to detail, the writing is excellent and humor a fun diversion, and the combat forces you to think instead of like pointing at a group of monsters and clicking them to death.\n\nThis is what a real RPG game is all about!

They constantly keep you in the loop about EVERYTHING they are doing and why and showing updated videos covering everything with superb answers to live questions.  It's been a thrill to watch this game come into being and it's the first one that has surpassed all my expectactions.  The Turn Based nature is so versatile, characters can be so unique, Co-Op is just way beyond what I would have expected and then even more beyond what I could have expected is the Editor that allows everyone to create their own games to freely share with others.  Not since Never Winter Nights have I see this attempted.  It's just amazing all they have been able to complete and I'm so happy to have been able to help Kick Start this wonderful achievement.   I'm still holding off to play more fully until the full release but from testing it all out regularly everything has been improved on steadily and I haven't come accross any  bugs personally.  It all looks beautiful and deep.  I've given to many Kickstarter Campaigns, but this one has really been the best by a long shot in covering all that a Kickstarter campaign should.  I hope many other developers go by their example.  While waiting I've just gotted into Divinity 2 which I somehow missed along the way and it's been a blast too!  Larian and CD Project are now my two favorite developers!  Oh and surely check out the Twitch TV interviews that go along with this game.  They are soo good.  One just uploaded on the 18th even.

I'm not the most patient person to begin with, but after Googling the answers to some of the puzzles I ask myself, how was I supposed to know that?

An old-school RPG with turn-based combat, a well thought-through spell system (poison + fire = explosion, water/blood + electricity = stun, hitting puddles with fireballs makes them steam clouds, steam clouds + electricity = stun clouds and much, much more) and a huge, very detailed world with many secrets to discover make this game the best game I have played this year so far. I've heard people criticize the lack of a 100% voice-over, but Fallout 2 didn't have complete voice-overs and is considered one of the best RPGs up to this day.\n\nThe negative points I have are these:\n- more or less bland companions. You don't get to know a lot about them, and both are only relevant for one or two quests overall, but depending on how you chose your main character's classes they complement your party very well. If you want to play "alone" (ie. only with your 2 main characters, there is an extra perk for that as well)\n- the story could have had better pacing. For the first half of the game the story makes total sense, you are investigating an outbreak of undeads and some other things on the side, and then suddenly everything gets overthrown and for a while you are left wondering what is going on. Luckily this gets cleared up shortly after, but it was still a little confusing in the beginning\n- the fights in the beginning of the game start out extremely challenging, but lose the intensity later-on as more of your characters can learn healing spells and have high resistances gainst the spell schools etc..\n- also, money inflation is a problem. In the beginning you never have enough money, but after ~15h played I had so much money I traded items with vendors for free just to get them out of my inventory\n\nHowever, these negative points are far outweighed by the positive aspects of this game, and it has been a long time since I put 65h+ into game in such a short time (the last game was Skyrim, and only due to mods that I spent so much time with it).\n\nIf you like RPGs and you are not put off by turn-based combat or lack of complete voice-over then this is a must buy!","July 24, 2014","true","67.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a bold statement... and shouldn't be taken lightly. Divinity: Original Sin is the BEST RPG I've ever played. Nothing can touch it. It's also my GOTY, hands down.\n\nRarely does a developer put so much of their love and affection into a game. Larian have, and by doing so, they've changed the game, maybe even the rulebook for every RPG that follows. This is the new benchmark, probably for any genre.\n\nEven if you don't like RPGs, D:OS will have something for you. Even if you're a casual gamer, it's so well paced, you could hop in for just half an hour at a time. But you wont.\n\nYou'll be drawn into a beautiful, complex and vibrant world of adventure, mystery and more importantly FUN.\n\nD:OS won't hold your hand, or assume you're stupid. You can do ANYTHING from the get go. GO anywhere.\n\nThis freedom isn't just limited to what you can do, it's how you do it.\n\nYou're offered choices constantly, be it through clever dialogues with NPC's or gameplay itself. The game will know what you've done, who knows about it, and who it will effect and adjust itself accordingly.\n\nI'm not going to offer any spoilers here past the first hour. That would be morally bankrupt. The beauty of this game, is discovering it for yourself.\n\nD:OS doesn't stop you from doing what you want. You can treat people how you want, do quests any way you want and shape the story any way you want. This is role playing at it's finest. Actually *Playing a Role*. Want to be the bad guy with a penchant for stealing fine art from inns? Go ahead, or maybe you want to be the wordsmith that uses their charm and intellect to feed your cheese habit. Real freedom, and from it comes real fun.\n\nIf it's there, you can interact with it. You can even do it in combat too...\n\nCombat... oh yeah! There's so much to do that isn't fighting, that I almost forgot! The combat in D:OS, is quite simply, the best turn-based combat system ever devised. I'm not even going to describe it. Words don't do it justice.\n\nThe worst thing you can do, is ignore this game. It may 'look' like a generic RPG from screenshots, but once you're in, you're not getting out without loving it.\n\nOne thing I wish could be implemented is controller support. Then, this game would be absolute perfection.\n\n10/10 Must buy.","July 28, 2014","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've played RPG games all my life. I grew up playing games like Zelda, Diablo and Balder's Gate .etc. So, I feel pretty qualified to talk about RPG games :D\n\nDivinity: Original Sin is potentially one of the best RPG games of this generation. It is definately a 'classic', and I would say that it's (basically) the modern day equivelent of Balder's Gate.\n\nLet me put it plainly; if you like old-school role playing games like Diablo 1, Dungeons & Dragons, or Balder's Gate, then you *WILL* enjoy this game. No doubt. You will enjoy it even more if you have someone to play with too (the game supports two players, and you can either play on LAN, specific people over the internet, or in 'public games' on the internet where anyone can join) -- it really has something for everyone! (although i prefer to play solo, cos i'm an insocialable basturd xD)\n\nBut yea, I don't usually buy games unless they're like -80% sale, but this one was definitely worth it. I've spent about 120 hours so far on this game, and I'm only like 10% through the game (I keep deleting and remaking my characters cos I'm very indecisive on what setup to play xD), so that's value for money!!\n\nI fully expect to spend over 1000 hours playing this game, since there is just so much content to explore and find... people to talk to, secrets to reveal... gawd I love this game :'D\n\nSeriously.

It has a fun story and the combat is engaging and mostly deterministic. I've played about 20 hours, and I think I've exhausted the currently available alpha content. I'd like to have an option for a free rotating camera; since everything seems to be fully 3d modeled, I don't see any technical reason not to. It would also be nice to have dialog choices somewhere in between "I hate you and want you to die" and "I love you, let me be your slave forever". Aside from a few small bugs and the above issues, I have no complaints about the game. Definitely worth buying, even if they release the other 80% of the game without fixing any of the issues.\n\nRelease update:\nThe game is still very worth buying. I haven't noticed any of the bugs that I experienced in early access now that it has been released.\nI'm playing multiplayer now and it is loads of fun. Co-operating with a friend adds a whole new dimension to combat. Text chat works well, athough text chat is inherently clunky for this kind of game. I'd reccommend being on skype or teamspeak to play with a friend or three.\nAn option for a free rotating camera has been added (I love you for this Larian Studios) with the caveat that the main compaign wasn't intended to be view from the unlocked angles. I haven't noticed any artifacts yet, but I'm incredibly pleased to have the option even if I did see them.\n\nMinor griefs:\nThe only bug (new; nothing that I saw in EA still exists) that has bothered me is that walking on environmental surfaces seems to tick the environmental damage way too many times. Zombies can walk across their own secreted poision to heal to full and one of my party members walking across a single meter of poision surface might take 5x 10-15 damage ticks and end up almost dead.\nThe multiplayer chat window makes it a bit tough for both players to keep up with the story when only one player gets to see the dialogue play out in the large font, high contrast window (and view what can be said instead of only what is said).\nI initially had trouble getting my friend's companion to bind back to him when reloading; it turns out that companions are configured with the first button on the esc menu. The dialogue options are still very binary, the same as they were during early access.\n\nOverall:\nThe game plays a lot like D&D (4th ed? no daily limits on spells for spellcasters in this) for the computer. If you like D&D then you will probably like Divinity: Original Sin.\nNew campaigns and mods from the dev tools will only make D:OS better.\nThe overall experience is phenomenal. Grab a friend and start playing.","March 22, 2014","true","140.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

An old-school RPG with turn-based combat, a well thought-through spell system (poison + fire = explosion, water/blood + electricity = stun, hitting puddles with fireballs makes them steam clouds, steam clouds + electricity = stun clouds and much, much more) and a huge, very detailed world with many secrets to discover make this game the best game I have played this year so far. I've heard people criticize the lack of a 100% voice-over, but Fallout 2 didn't have complete voice-overs and is considered one of the best RPGs up to this day.\n\nThe negative points I have are these:\n- more or less bland companions. You don't get to know a lot about them, and both are only relevant for one or two quests overall, but depending on how you chose your main character's classes they complement your party very well. If you want to play "alone" (ie. only with your 2 main characters, there is an extra perk for that as well)\n- the story could have had better pacing. For the first half of the game the story makes total sense, you are investigating an outbreak of undeads and some other things on the side, and then suddenly everything gets overthrown and for a while you are left wondering what is going on. Luckily this gets cleared up shortly after, but it was still a little confusing in the beginning\n- the fights in the beginning of the game start out extremely challenging, but lose the intensity later-on as more of your characters can learn healing spells and have high resistances gainst the spell schools etc..\n- also, money inflation is a problem. In the beginning you never have enough money, but after ~15h played I had so much money I traded items with vendors for free just to get them out of my inventory\n\nHowever, these negative points are far outweighed by the positive aspects of this game, and it has been a long time since I put 65h+ into game in such a short time (the last game was Skyrim, and only due to mods that I spent so much time with it).\n\nIf you like RPGs and you are not put off by turn-based combat or lack of complete voice-over then this is a must buy!","July 24, 2014","true","67.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game will know what you've done, who knows about it, and who it will effect and adjust itself accordingly.\n\nI'm not going to offer any spoilers here past the first hour. That would be morally bankrupt. The beauty of this game, is discovering it for yourself.\n\nD:OS doesn't stop you from doing what you want. You can treat people how you want, do quests any way you want and shape the story any way you want. This is role playing at it's finest. Actually *Playing a Role*. Want to be the bad guy with a penchant for stealing fine art from inns? Go ahead, or maybe you want to be the wordsmith that uses their charm and intellect to feed your cheese habit. Real freedom, and from it comes real fun.\n\nIf it's there, you can interact with it. You can even do it in combat too...\n\nCombat... oh yeah! There's so much to do that isn't fighting, that I almost forgot! The combat in D:OS, is quite simply, the best turn-based combat system ever devised. I'm not even going to describe it. Words don't do it justice.\n\nThe worst thing you can do, is ignore this game. It may 'look' like a generic RPG from screenshots, but once you're in, you're not getting out without loving it.\n\nOne thing I wish could be implemented is controller support. Then, this game would be absolute perfection.\n\n10/10 Must buy.","July 28, 2014","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not an old school PC RPG player, so I don't have any stories about Baldur's Gate or Planescape. Regardless, this is probably the best RPG to be released since Origins and has captured more of my time than I can scarcely begin to understand. The gameplay lends itself to thought and thankfully doesn't hold your hand with quest markers, flickering trails to the next objective or obvious build decisions. If you're not a veteran of the genre the game is going to sock you in the face over and over again, but it feels so good when you do finally learn to dodge the punch. Encounters, especially with bosses, seem unfair at the outset when they pit your 2 to 4 man group up against 5, 6 or 7+ enemies. A little element mixing and ingenuity can see two turns tilt a battle in your favor or bad positioning have you reloading in a heartbeat. You can use mages to deal massive AOE damage by combining elements such as fire and poison for huge explosions or catering to a melee character with massive magic buffs to create a massive wrecking ball. There's a certain level of sarcasm and wit peppered into the dialogue along with pop culture references that can bring a smile to the face without really overwhelming. Good music, nice looking areas--it's definitely worthy of all of the great reviews it's been getting. In a few weeks I'll probably have a 100+ hours into this and I'll still be coming back for more. There's even frickin' multiplayer, with rock-paper-scissor arguements that can come up between players on how to handle quest decisions. If you don't have a friend you can set your AI partner's behavior and experience two main characters disagreeing. It's fantastic. Oh, you can rob entire towns blind, too.","July 27, 2014","true","72.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The turn based combat is also a nice change from the wave of ARPGs lately that haven't been doing much for me. I have a chunk of hours already invested, and my characters are barely level 4.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodyzx/recommended/230230/","bloodyzx","ZG.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodyzx/","78 products in account","I didn't hear of this game until shortly before its release, but when I saw it in the Steam Sale and watched some gameplay videos of it I was instantly interested in it. An old-school RPG with turn-based combat, a well thought-through spell system (poison + fire = explosion, water/blood + electricity = stun, hitting puddles with fireballs makes them steam clouds, steam clouds + electricity = stun clouds and much, much more) and a huge, very detailed world with many secrets to discover make this game the best game I have played this year so far. I've heard people criticize the lack of a 100% voice-over, but Fallout 2 didn't have complete voice-overs and is considered one of the best RPGs up to this day.\n\nThe negative points I have are these:\n- more or less bland companions. You don't get to know a lot about them, and both are only relevant for one or two quests overall, but depending on how you chose your main character's classes they complement your party very well. If you want to play "alone" (ie. only with your 2 main characters, there is an extra perk for that as well)\n- the story could have had better pacing. For the first half of the game the story makes total sense, you are investigating an outbreak of undeads and some other things on the side, and then suddenly everything gets overthrown and for a while you are left wondering what is going on. Luckily this gets cleared up shortly after, but it was still a little confusing in the beginning\n- the fights in the beginning of the game start out extremely challenging, but lose the intensity later-on as more of your characters can learn healing spells and have high resistances gainst the spell schools etc..\n- also, money inflation is a problem. In the beginning you never have enough money, but after ~15h played I had so much money I traded items with vendors for free just to get them out of my inventory\n\nHowever, these negative points are far outweighed by the positive aspects of this game, and it has been a long time since I put 65h+ into game in such a short time (the last game was Skyrim, and only due to mods that I spent so much time with it).\n\nIf you like RPGs and you are not put off by turn-based combat or lack of complete voice-over then this is a must buy!","July 24, 2014","true","67.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They will go to an easily accessible list, but it will be in the form of "When trying to survive in the wild, I think a couple of branches are priceless. They can be made into a make-shift spear, staff or even a make-shift dagger."\nYou can also try to use common sense and discover crafting formulas on your own, if your character has enough crafting skill of course.\n\nBasically, the game expects you to read the lore, and to think for yourself when trying to both survive combat and solve the various puzzles.\n\nRegarding the difficulty levels of the game:\nI've put in hundreds of hours in all the XCom games, all Civilization games, all Fallout games, Baldur's Gate, PlaneScape:Torment, and I love those kinds of slow tactical and strategic games.\nI don't know if I just got lucky with my skill choices, or it was because of the games I've played, but I started on normal, and thought it wasn't that bad.\nSure, at first I got killed several times until I started to understand how I should play the game... and after that point, it wasn't that hard anymore.\n\nThe encounters don't normally scale with your level, but there are a few cases where I've seen them scale, but that might have been because I attacked friendlies for extra XP (whoops!).\nAfter some 30 hours of play, I joined a multiplayer session which was set to Hard, and I didn't notice it was on the Hard difficulty level.\n\nMy point: If you like tactical games, you'll learn how to play the game. You can still go too far, too soon and be in a very tough situation... which you can still win by outsmarting your opponents...","August 5, 2014","true","105.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

HELL YES!\nThis game is a mix of all the old school greats, Ultimas, Baldurs Gates, Torment, Fallout, etc.\n\nWhat I liked alot:\nStory - There is a huge fleshed out world, lots of lore, books, etc for those that choose to read everything. The actual main story was fleshed out and interesting, it made me want to finish the game to figure out what happened.\n\nWorld - The world was pretty cool, very detailed with little things hiding everywhere for you to find.  They rewarded people that where willing to go adventuring.\n\nGraphics - Graphics where great, I had everything maxed out and did't have any preformance issues or find a problem with anything.  There where several different tilesets as well, so the world didn't get boring for me on my run through the game.\n\nSpell System - The spells where great.  Nice visual effects, can be mixed and matched to create extra nice effects, ie Lightning + Water.  This aspect also made you more careful, because if your own guy was in the water.... you get the meaning :). You had to be somewhat intelligent about what you cast also, spell effects would cause things like line of site issues, etc.  Hard to heal people when you drop a fireball between you and them and the place goes up in smoke and fire!\n\nComabt - I've read reviews about people complaining about the combat, but it's perfect for this game.  It's turned based, initiative style, there's numerous different ways to finish off encounters and fights. It was as good of a system as I could have asked for for a multi character party game while still maintaining control of each charcter with precision.\n\n\n\nWhat I liked but I thought could use some more work:\n\nCharacter Progression/Building- This was a little confusing at first, I didn't know what did what, what was good, etc. I had to do a little research outside of the game, but once I god how it worked, understood what was important and not so much I was good to go.  It was pretty easy to build an uber party, basically my 2 casters would buff my 2 frontline guys and they would go and destroy everything. With that being said maybe the difficulty could have been a little harder?\n\nQuesting - Questing was great, there was some awesome quests, things that made me laugh, etc.  Some of the quests where hard to figure out and I had to get help from outside resource sites with where to go next because there wasn't enough clues (for me anyhow) telling me where to go.  I'm not asking for a big arrow pointing to everything, but some  more direction would have been more helpful, either on the map or in the quest log.\n\nPuzzles - Some of these where downright hard/impossible. I found myself looking for help more then a few times with how to solve puzzles, especiallly the weight puzzle. I have no idea how anyone would ever figure that out (This is after I tried for over an hour). Just asking for some more direction.\n\nCrafting - The crafting was awesome and vastly helped out once I figured out how to use it but some of the blacksmithing stuff vs crafting stuff didn't make sense.  Regardless, make one of your characters have level 5 Crafting and Blacksmithing by the end of the game if you can.  There's numerous resource sites for how to make stuff also as the in-game books can be confusing, and are not organized, etc.\n\n\nAll in all, this is a great game.  The 9/10 reviews are spot on and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is nostalgic for an old school RPG in todays clothing.  The developers did an amazing job, and hopefully they have an expansion out soon, I know I'll be buying it.","August 9, 2014","true","105.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has much of what was great about Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Icewind Dale, and Arcanum: of Steamworks and Magic Obscura... but with a lot of the gameplay and graphical advances you'd expect after 10+ years of time for the industry to advance.  There isn't much that's quite as satisfying as having two magic users using the environment and each others magic effects to boost damage...except maybe doing it with a friend via multiplayer.\n\nSo far my main gripe is the sound.  The music can drone on and make you want to mute it, and god help you if you want to read anything while standing next to a group of NPCs whose dialogue will loop with only a few seconds of blessed silence between.\n\nThe end result so far is a really good game.

I knew it was an RPG and a lot of people were hyping it as amazing. My very first impression was that it was clunky and awkward. I was barraged very quickly with all sorts of things to do and places to go it was almost overwhelmingly busy. In definitely wasn't intuitive for me at first. After a couple hours I started getting used to things and it actually started becoming a lot of fun. The more I play it, the better it seems to get. Within a couple hours it very enjoyable and I wasn't noticing any of things that were bothering me before. I'm not terribly far in at the point that I'm writing this, but I'm pretty thoroughly impressed by it and would definitely say it's worth a buy.\n\nThe simplest way I could probably sum it up is as a cross between Baldur's Gate and Diablo, but it feels much more like the prior.","July 28, 2014","true","104.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mahmutti/recommended/230230/","Mahmutti","mahmutti","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mahmutti/","159 products in account","A very solid game overall - a must-buy if you're a fan of old-school cRPGs.\n\nThe turn-based combat system is extremely deep and (especially in co-op mode) seems to help in making the combat not feel like a chore. It does have issues: often times it'll be hard to see where the edges of ground effects (fire, poison, etc.) are, especially if they're covered by grass. This has resulted in my characters taking unnecessary damage more times than I can count. Often times your character's vision will also be blocked for no reason, which can be frustrating. However, these issues are only minor and I expect they will be patched out in the near future.\n\nThe story is engaging and the quests are mostly interesting, but unfortunately (or fortunately if you're like me) there's barely any voice acting. That is forgivable, though, as the game has a gigantic amount of dialogue. If you like reading, just buy the game already!\n\nOne additional point I must bring up is the fact that the game starts off in a slow-ish manner. My friend and I were not very impressed by the combat system at the very beginning of the game, but it gets SO MUCH better after a few hours once you start getting more and more abilities to play around with.\n\nTo summarize: the game is very good, but not perfect. 100% recommended if you're into cRPGs, otherwise you might want to read around a bit more to make sure that the game is for you.","July 3, 2014","true","21.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I started a single player game and i can open it up for a friend at any given time if i please. So the character creation, you do as you wish here. There is no ultimate combo, either way you will be missing out on things. Wich is a good thing because there is SO much to do and find in this game. So when you are done creating you begin. I made a Battlemage and a Ranger. You can also switch some of the starting spells, attributes, talents and abilities for both the characters. But if you not to familiar with this kind of game or RPG's in general. Fret not, the game itself is easy enough to understand as you go without treating you like an unexperienced ♥♥♥♥♥. The combat itself is turn-based and never real-time. Wich you may like or dont. This game is nothing like Diablo, Path of Exile or Torchlight. This game is NOT a "Hack and slash" You can't grind by slaying enemies for 4 hours. The ones you kill don't come back. (Most of the time.) Now to one core element of the game. NPC's, they are everywhere and they are colorful. They have their own problems, sorrows and desires. The game premise is that you are Source Hunters and have been sent to a City to investigate a murder. I actually felt more like a detective here than in\nL.A Noire. May not sound that impressive. You FEEL like an investigator trying to fit the pieces. But there is more, there are places to go, dungeons to enter, strange and dark forrests to pass. Some encounters i came to i just simply died. It wasn a fight even. So there's exploration as well, wich grants you Experience as well. Crafting is also a big part of the game and thats unusual in games like this and it may take a while before you understand how it works if you choose to figure that out for yourself. Wich can be more fun than the game telling you exactly what to and how to all the time. Then you have the Spellbooks and spellscrolls that you can find and also create with the right skills and equippement. At first the game may seem a bit overwhelming to newcommers, heck it even may be a bit overwhelming for Veterans of the genre. But even here Larian Studios knows what they are doing. You play at your own pace, the game sets you on a beach and from there you do whatever you want to. Basically. There are no "Mission Arrows" pointing you from A to B in a linear line like most games today. You choose to do the missions you find in what way and order you feel like. Now the combat itself, it is like chess only ALOT more fun. :) And it works like this, your one hero may have 20 AP (Action Points) Telling you how far you can go and what spells costs. And they represent this in way that you don't even have to do any number crunching. They just use green and red little bubbles on the lower screen showing you how many AP you have left after a fireball for example. So its easy to learn and helluva lot of fun to try and master. Every battle can be a challenege and can take 15-60 minutes sometimes and its awesome. You cheer when you they miss and when you strike them down with a vengence! Bones and flesh flies accros the battlefield when fireballs and lightning hit! And then we the moral choices the game represents. As mentioned you meet NPC all over the place. Do you choose to help them, ignore them or straight out murder where they stand? You pick but beware, it has permanent consequences on you character and the world you live in. Now to the things you may not like. Stats, number crunching, no combat based grinding, no hand holding, reading, thinking,\n\nLast note: The game is buildt with Co-op in mind. So during some conversations with NPC's you will discuss with your firend ingame what to do. Wich may lead to some real actual discussion. The moral choices are not always easy to pick i can tell you. Larian Studios dont treat you like a complete idiot so its not always black and white. And when you disagree completely with your friend. The game puts you in a mini game with your friend and you will have to play a game of Stone, paper, scissors. :) You may enjoy that or not. In the end, the game has tons of things for you to do. It brings tactical combat challenges, puzzels, hard choices to make, exploration, diversity, humor, heart and lore. If you have EVER enjoyed an RPG game it is very unlikely you will dislike this one.\n\nHappy Source hunting.\n\nPeace.","July 11, 2014","true","208.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also the Deciding system is a great idea.. and the social boni, which grant you a lot of passive ability points.\nAnd at least.. it has cats!   Quests from Cats, a "cat wedding" and a cat-astic Sorcerer!  And a cat-bonus-song in the tavern!\n\nThe only negative point is also the deciding system against the KI.   They use a quite simple algorythmic which is really easy to look through. There are ~3 ways how they use the rock-paper-sissors game.  For example: first they use Rock, than paper, scissors, rock, parper, scissors, ....       or  rock, paper, paper, rock, paper, ..    it could be that it was only coincidence.. (or my luck-skill!), but it was quite easy for me to win every contest.     I hope Larian make it more randomly.\n\nGraphics: 8/10\nSound: 10/10\nBalance: 9/10 *\nAtmosphere: 9/10\nLeveldesign: 9/10\nRPG-Factor: 9/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nDifficulty: 7/10\nCrafting: 8/10\nHandling: 7/10\nCo-op: not tested\nLevel Editor: not tested\n\nTotal: 84/100\n\n* tested in Beta, but it was still totally playable and I found also only one Bug.

Well, now it's finally going to release and I must say it's a very well made Ultima/Baulder's Gate styled game that will leave you doing random stuff for hours. Literally hours. I think that's the only bad quality of the game. You can play for eight hours straight and seemingly get nowhere. That was the charm of Ultima too, but in this case, for my life and where it is, I don't have the patience.\n\nThe graphics are very good for the isometric portrayal of the game world, and the interactions with the environment are a welcome sight to see. Although the world feels alive, the people feel dull. Many of the villagers will not help you much with quests as they all say the same thing and do little in hinting you where to go next. That just adds to the hours spent meandering around doing nothing. While I love it when a game does not hold your hand it must try better at making you understand the world you are playing in. Otherwise I'd love to see more map markers for quests.\n\nCombat is highly rewarding. Finally we have a game where your tactical decisions mean a lot. I was expecting this from games like Dragon Age but that game never had the envronment as a tactic as much as this game does. Your characters matter, and a team of warriors will be ill prepared against magic while a team of rogues will die fast against a strong opponent. By using your partners to full effectiveness, it feels everyone has a place in the world.\n\nThe loot and trading is awesome and makes the game feel very free and open. You can do anything you want. Lastly, the music and menu design is very well done. All things considered this is a really well built game, with deep lore to explore, allows you to do anything you want, and keeps you progressing as you play. But I will warn you: be prepared to sink a few hundred hours on your first playthrough (unaided) since a few quests can be a bit overmuch to explore.\n\nI'll also add, the first quests make it very slow to have multiple playthroughs of the game. If I were you I'd skip most of them just to get your playthroughs underway. Most of the stuff in the first town is talking and meandering and highly forgettable.","June 22, 2014","true","40.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Divinity: Original Sin. I’ve had my eye on it for a long time, and they released a collector’s edition that comes with 2 copies of the game and both it’s predecessors, plus free launch DLC. So I caved. After playing the game, I definitely see why its still in early access and why save games won’t be carrying over to final release but holy hell is it fun. Its a very diablo-esque dungeon crawler but the combat is turn based, rather than real time and a lot of the different skills play off eachother. For example, I can cast a rain storm over the battlefield which puts out any fires and eliminates the burning status effect. Then my wife casts a chain lightning and it does increased damage to every enemy it hits because they’re in the rain. The combinations are all over the place: oil+fire, water+lightning, theres a bunch. I definitely recommend at least looking into it, if this piques your interest.","June 19, 2014","true","99.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is almost the gold standard for RPG of this kind.  It is well worth the money, I got 87 hours out of it and I didn't even complete everything.  It is a lot of fun and is a dynamic world.  For example in most games where you see backdrops of crates you can't interact with, in this game you can.  You can move them or set them on fire.  A door locked and can't find the key?  Bash or burn it down if you like.\n\nAnyway,  I would strongly reccomend that you wait at least 3 months after this game is released to buy it for the following reasons.  By this time I sure hope there are good walk-though guides available.\n\nThe quests in this game are very old-school.  They do not give you a lot of hints and there in no guidance in the least.  Some of them may require that you find hidden switches and hit them in the right order.  You will not know how many hidden switches there are.  You might find three of them and try all combos and nothing happens.  Well you need to find the 4th switch and try again... maybe find the 5th one?\n\nOne quest requires you to find a hidden object, this is a main quest so you have to do it.  This object is "somewhere" in a large forest.  You need a perception of like 12 to "see" it.  Stats are very precious and you generally are not going to be able to pump perception as other stats are FAR more important.   The only way I solved it was by finding a screen shot of the locaiton, then moving my character there, putting on all +perception gear I could find, and THEN drank a super preception potion and FINALLY I could "see" this huge mound of dirt that had the item I needed.\n\nIt is stuff like this that pisses me off and really takes away from this game.  I would really like to know if people find stuff like this naturally without guides.  Other than stuff like that, this is a great game.","July 11, 2014","true","85.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theevilbob/recommended/230230/","theevilbob","TheEvilBob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theevilbob/","438 products in account","Updated Review --\nI like it!\n\nTo start with, the world is big, there's lot to do and see and, in some ways a bit too much - your quest log is going to get overwhelmingly full and you'll probably end up somewhere new wondering why the hell you're standing there and trying to remember what your original goal was five hours ago.\n\nIt looks beautiful, almost too much as it can be very easy to overlook something visually and start wondering what's gone wrong. In particular the ALT key to show items on the ground doesn't show all items, just 'equipable' stuff it seems. Unfortunantly there doesn't seem to be a way to have those items always show either, so you'll be holding down alt a lot.\n\nThe UI has seen quite a bit of improvement though there are still some bugs to work out, multiplayer even more so. Some examples are the combat log not scrolling, the dialogue not showing you what the other person selected in the log, and the combative dialoge forcing you to scroll up to see some of what was said. Those and a few other things could stand to be tweaked.\n\nProgression is a little different from many modern games - you wont get a bunch of points every level that make a little difference but just one every few levels that will make a big difference. This also means not screwing up what you choose is important as, so far, I haven't come across a way to respec. Which is a shame since you're probably going to regret a point or two.\n\nCombat is good but sloppy, you can pretty much count on setting things on fire you didn't mean to and having a spell hit a wall when it shows a hit. There's also something a little wacky about a few of the element interactions (fire not always exploding a poison cloud or fire healing a water enemy because it melted ice into a puddle are a couple of examples) - they may seem that way because it's all based on rolls but without the log showing all those odds it's a little hard to say for sure.\nDespite all that, causing a massive chain-reaction of explosions or stunning a whole group of people standing in water is a lot of fun and working all your party members strengths together to take down someone 5 levels higher than you is great. Even stubmling into a devistating ambush and being wiped out is amusing and reminds you to save often.\n\nThe music included is fantastic too, though the provided soundtrack, if you got it, doesn't seem to include the full library that was apparently put into the game. I do hope even more music gets added at some point as well since their composer's illness cut into what had been prepared for the game.\n\nIt's a great game and once the last of the bugs are squished, and Larian does tend to be very good about patching, this game will be amazing.\n\n\n\nOriginal Early Access Review --\nSo far, so good!\n\nAfter the Dragon Knight games I was excited to hear something new was in the works. While it's not the same style of RPG, it's got a Baulder's Gate vibe that was still appealing enough to back it on Kickstarter. Indeed, as the crowd-funding went on and more details and goals were reached, it very much became a source of excitement for me.\n\nAfter playing though some of the Alpha I was encouraged. The UI had some rough spots, there were some very obvious bugs and some subtle ones but even the update to Beta included a vast array of improvments that left a much more polished feel.\n\nObviously things are still going to change and I've held back from playing too much before the final version, but from what I've seen so far, if you enjoy a big RPG with what seems to be a delightful level of depth and want turn-based combat where stratedgy plays a real factor, it's certainly worth checking out.","April 10, 2014","true","102.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(cover enemies in oil and light them on fire, then make it rain and freeze them. Only one example.)\n+ Well, I'm done here, play the game, find a few points for yourself, be surprised.\n\nThere is only one downside, most of the dialogs are not voiced, so there's a lot to read.

But it also reminded me that that kind of classic RPG barely exists anymore. The only game in the last few years I can think of that went into the same direction (gameplay wise, not thematically ofc) was Shadowrun Returns, and with limited success.\n\nWell look no further, because Divinity is that modern day Baldur's Gate experience we didn't get in many years. It's beautiful, complex, thoughtful and challenging. The battles are turn-based with action points. Every class and magic school has it's own niche and reason to exist. It's also very challenging early on and you'll have to make use of every tool at your disposal to get through. Unlike past games in the genre it's not so hard that you'll constantly feel forced to save scum however. For me it was a perfect balance. Character customization is complex enough to motivate, though I would have liked to see more talents. Lot's of loot too, though I had terrible luck or the system needs some work, by the end I was still running around partially with Lv 8 equipment because nothing better ever dropped.\n\nThere is also crafting which is probably a bit overpowered and clunky to use. The crafting is also responsible for a very cluttered inventory system. But we've seen worse back in the day (arrow management in BG...).\n\nThe only real negative I have for the game is that I could have lived without the "find the 5 clickable pixels" hidden object-style exploration puzzles the game sometimes throws at you. But everything else gets a big thumps-up.","August 1, 2014","true","51.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I... well, I can't really put it into words. Many people compare this to old-school RPGs like Neverwinter Nights, Baldur's Gate, and Ultima, and while I can honestly say I see the homage quite clearly, D:OS introduces many new concepts too. Co-op works seamlessly and flawlessly, the editor is great, and I can't wait to see what modders do with this game. My only main complaint about the game is the inventory system - it's a little clunky and hard to navigate at times, especially when you have a lot of items. The writing is clever and humorous, and I just found myself reading books and immersing myself in the world for hours on end - and I continue to do so as I play through the game.\n\nSo, how do you know if this game is for you? Honestly, if you've enjoyed any old-school isometric RPGs in the past (or currently), chances are that you'll enjoy this game. For a newcomer to the genre of CRPGs? Watch a couple videos, if you have friends who personally like the game, shoot them a message and ask them why it's great.

No predetermined classes, customise all your characters to your hearts delight. Quests do not handhold you by placing quest markers, you have to really read the dialogue and pay attention to everything. Morality is subjective and not just an obvious choice between black and white (mostly). And exploration. Exploration is everything in this game and if you do not explore, you will miss a hell of a lot of stuff.\n\nCombat is your 'traditional' action point based system (i.e. no modern game really uses it) and its compentent enough. But the effects are amazing. Elements will react with each other; fire and water turns to burning hot steam, explosive gas can get ignited etc. Feel the satisfaction of electrifying ten people who 'happen' to stand in water. :p\n\nAdmittedly this game isn't for people who like, maybe, the more streamlined combat and quests of Skyrim, where all the combat is real time and the quests mostly point you towards the next dungeon filled with loot and monsters.

Probably my first computer gaming experience was Ultima VII. I never finished it. It was too long, I was too young, and it was too hard to get games to run in the first place back then (memory managers? who remembers that crap?). It has, in the rouchly 25 years of gaming since then, been my white whale. I think about it constantly and long to play it again and finally finish it.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin captures so much of what made that game great to me, and so much of what simply doesn't exist in gaming today. It shines creatively, both in a refreshing take on stats/classes/skills/etc, as well as the story. I personally found the graphics to be very good as well. Art is a purely subjective thing to discuss, and I won't say that this game is for everyone. But I will say, if you want a deep role playing experience, turn-based combat, and a pool of nostalgia deep enough to drown in, this is the game for you.","July 12, 2014","true","24.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As an indie game, it has held my attention longer than almost any AAA title in the past year.  The character creation is both intricate, yet comprehensive.  Despite my personal feeling about Blizzard entertainment, their moto of "Easy to pick up, difficult to master" is an excellent saying and it rings true in Divinity.\n\nThe combat is much like the TU (time unit) based combat from the original X-com game, but the game plays like an old school DnD (Dungeons and Dragons) campaign very similar to Baulders Gate, or Dragon's Age Origins.  The story isn't a master-piece but it's solid enough to warrant your interest until the very end of the game.  Speaking of the end of the game, holy ♥♥♥♥ the content!  There is so much to do, and so many places to explore and options to choose from, if you're thorough, this game will easily last you 100+ hours.\n\nLike every indie game, it has it's share of bugs but they are generally minor.  The game has a bit of a learning curve, but also has a lot of details built in which allow you to approach problems from many different angles.  You can also play this game in co-op, and if you're at all computer savvy, you can customize it to hold 3 of your friends!\n\nThere are many other wonderful secrets I could touch upon but, I would rather have YOU discover them for yourself.

Divinity: Original Sin is maximalist game design philosophy at its absolute best in RPG form, even if the individual parts aren’t all top tier. I hadn’t played a proper party based CRPG since KOTOR and NWN back in the day and wasn’t particularly interested in the latest wave of Kickstarter revivals either, but curiosity and its promise of clever turn based tactics got the best of me after noticing D:OS had been the number one seller on Steam for WEEKS after its launch. I checked out a random gameplay vid on Youtube, which ended up being a whole encounter early on, which was enough by itself to immediately sell me on the game. Let’s be perfectly honest here, the battle system is the star here and is by far my favorite RPG combat ever. Seriously, nothing but the most complex SRPGs can even hold a candle to the veritable chemistry set of options available to players here. The encounters, at least in the first act, make excellent use of these systems resulting in around 30 hours of stiffly challenging tactical bliss. Just a few fight highlights just in the first map of the game:\n\nAfter realizing that fire ignites poison surfaces and hard landings cause impact damage, I teleport dropped my fire elemental summon close to enemies in a poison pool causing the entire pool to explode, in addition to the impact damage, killing everything in it instantly.\nGetting ambushed and surrounded on all sides by about 20 exploding barrel skeletons and having to cleverly manipulate chain reactions while not instakilling my party of 4 in the process.\nThe final boss of Act 1 being some massive demon ♥♥♥♥er flanked by the three other, also quite difficult, sub-bosses of the act. Took me a few tries but I eventually took him down with no casualties after 30+ minutes of grueling combat. My favorite boss fight in a turn based game by a mile.\nOutside of combat, it’s still pretty damn good except for the overall plot and main story writing. I took a liking to the goofy tone (especially the talking animals, like my boy Unsinkable Sam and the murder victim’s dog, who surprising came into combat to help me fight some recently exhumed corpses), which some regard as out of place in a game like this but to me it makes perfect sense. When your various methods of interactivity are so playful and exuberant, why contradict yourself with the standard dreary dark fantasy self-seriousness? Speaking of playful interactions, there’s plenty of it outside of fighting. Pretty much everything in the world exists as a manipulable object with its own physics properties, health and such… Quests can be solved in a crazy amount of ways, which is necessary given the journal doesn’t give you exact information about the what and where. Investigations actually feel like investigations, not errands as they often do in quest marker oriented games. Anything that reminds me of Morrowind in that regard is a plus in my book.\n\nThe difficulty and quality of the encounters take a dive after the Act 1, and to be quite honest I didn’t even finish it. Act 1 is transcendent enough to where that barely matters to me, and could be my GOTY based on it alone. What keeps me excited is the continued attempts of director Swen Vincke and Larian Studios to understand where they went wrong and to make iterations on this engine and formula for D:OS and future games[www.lar.net], building up towards what they call “the very big RPG that will dwarf them all”. They’ve immediately shot up into my pantheon of favorite developers along with FROM, Platinum, and EAD Tokyo and their future looks bright as hell.\n\nShoutouts to the Kickstarter backers and and their collective milli and early access players for helping to make this happen with the balance and volume of stuff it deserved.","December 31, 2014","true","70.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/glazedkoala/recommended/230230/","glazedkoala","Molten Tomato","http://steamcommunity.com/id/glazedkoala/","82 products in account","This was my first PC RPG, so my review is without any nostalgia for this type of gameplay. And I loved the game. It wasn't perfect -- at times some things enfuriated me (backstabbing related usually), but overall it was amazing. I was obsessed. I still am.\n\nThe good:\n1. The battle system is great. There's a lot to think about and reason to pay careful attention to what enemies are doing on their turn. The game can be very hard, so optimizing your moves and performing smart combinations matter.  Magic spells can interact with each other in really rad ways.\n2. There are a lot of ways to complete quests, but it is still challenging to complete them.\n3. Non-combat skills feel very important! Crafting, being able to talk to animals, teleportation -- all of these and more can help a lot.  With a high enough pickpocket talent you can steal from anybody in the game (who has items to trade, such as all shop keepers).\n4. SO MUCH TO DO in every town! It really encourages exploration and does a good job of rewarding you.\n5. Side stories and quests can be very interesting and funny.\n6. The coop is well implemented. There are fun dialogs you can argue with your partner in. And it makes exploring towns go much faster when you split up.\n\nThe bad:\n1. I've heard people say the UI for this game is good. It's not. This must be a "compared to other PC RPGS" thing.  Your inventory will be a mess without enough good options for organization. Crafting can be a real pain because of this. Dragging an item through your inventory page by page is annoying. You can look at "only ingredients" in your inventory, but this doesn't help when you need to combine an ingredient with a weapon. I got around this by dragging things into pouches for crafting.\n2. The learning curve is a bit rough, especially with certain classes. I hated my Rogue for his first 6 levels or so. Part of the problem is that there isn't a very good UI for backstabbing.  Enemies stand in all sorts of weird poses, so it's not always obvious where their back is -- you can waste a lot of action points trying to find an enemies back.\n3. SO MUCH TO DO it can be overwhelming. Especially in the first town. It's best to just explore each town fully then leave the town only when you find you must (especially the first town, as you can level up a lot without leaving it).\n4. People can be pretty wordy. Especially Jahan. He likes to use a lot of words to say some lofty stuff that basically isn't interesting.\n5. It can be hard to follow dialog if you aren't the one being talked to (when playing coop). You don't get to see the normal dialog screen, instead it flashes above the NPC talking. Since NPCs like to use a lot of words regardless of what they are saying, often there's no time to read it. You can follow in a special dialog menu, but it's annoying to have to do that.","August 5, 2014","true","90.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It does have issues: often times it'll be hard to see where the edges of ground effects (fire, poison, etc.) are, especially if they're covered by grass. This has resulted in my characters taking unnecessary damage more times than I can count. Often times your character's vision will also be blocked for no reason, which can be frustrating. However, these issues are only minor and I expect they will be patched out in the near future.\n\nThe story is engaging and the quests are mostly interesting, but unfortunately (or fortunately if you're like me) there's barely any voice acting. That is forgivable, though, as the game has a gigantic amount of dialogue. If you like reading, just buy the game already!\n\nOne additional point I must bring up is the fact that the game starts off in a slow-ish manner. My friend and I were not very impressed by the combat system at the very beginning of the game, but it gets SO MUCH better after a few hours once you start getting more and more abilities to play around with.\n\nTo summarize: the game is very good, but not perfect. 100% recommended if you're into cRPGs, otherwise you might want to read around a bit more to make sure that the game is for you.","July 3, 2014","true","21.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I started a single player game and i can open it up for a friend at any given time if i please. So the character creation, you do as you wish here. There is no ultimate combo, either way you will be missing out on things. Wich is a good thing because there is SO much to do and find in this game. So when you are done creating you begin. I made a Battlemage and a Ranger. You can also switch some of the starting spells, attributes, talents and abilities for both the characters. But if you not to familiar with this kind of game or RPG's in general. Fret not, the game itself is easy enough to understand as you go without treating you like an unexperienced ♥♥♥♥♥. The combat itself is turn-based and never real-time. Wich you may like or dont. This game is nothing like Diablo, Path of Exile or Torchlight. This game is NOT a "Hack and slash" You can't grind by slaying enemies for 4 hours. The ones you kill don't come back. (Most of the time.) Now to one core element of the game. NPC's, they are everywhere and they are colorful. They have their own problems, sorrows and desires. The game premise is that you are Source Hunters and have been sent to a City to investigate a murder. I actually felt more like a detective here than in\nL.A Noire. May not sound that impressive. You FEEL like an investigator trying to fit the pieces. But there is more, there are places to go, dungeons to enter, strange and dark forrests to pass. Some encounters i came to i just simply died. It wasn a fight even. So there's exploration as well, wich grants you Experience as well. Crafting is also a big part of the game and thats unusual in games like this and it may take a while before you understand how it works if you choose to figure that out for yourself. Wich can be more fun than the game telling you exactly what to and how to all the time. Then you have the Spellbooks and spellscrolls that you can find and also create with the right skills and equippement. At first the game may seem a bit overwhelming to newcommers, heck it even may be a bit overwhelming for Veterans of the genre. But even here Larian Studios knows what they are doing. You play at your own pace, the game sets you on a beach and from there you do whatever you want to. Basically. There are no "Mission Arrows" pointing you from A to B in a linear line like most games today. You choose to do the missions you find in what way and order you feel like. Now the combat itself, it is like chess only ALOT more fun. :) And it works like this, your one hero may have 20 AP (Action Points) Telling you how far you can go and what spells costs. And they represent this in way that you don't even have to do any number crunching. They just use green and red little bubbles on the lower screen showing you how many AP you have left after a fireball for example. So its easy to learn and helluva lot of fun to try and master. Every battle can be a challenege and can take 15-60 minutes sometimes and its awesome. You cheer when you they miss and when you strike them down with a vengence! Bones and flesh flies accros the battlefield when fireballs and lightning hit! And then we the moral choices the game represents. As mentioned you meet NPC all over the place. Do you choose to help them, ignore them or straight out murder where they stand? You pick but beware, it has permanent consequences on you character and the world you live in. Now to the things you may not like. Stats, number crunching, no combat based grinding, no hand holding, reading, thinking,\n\nLast note: The game is buildt with Co-op in mind. So during some conversations with NPC's you will discuss with your firend ingame what to do. Wich may lead to some real actual discussion. The moral choices are not always easy to pick i can tell you. Larian Studios dont treat you like a complete idiot so its not always black and white. And when you disagree completely with your friend. The game puts you in a mini game with your friend and you will have to play a game of Stone, paper, scissors. :) You may enjoy that or not. In the end, the game has tons of things for you to do. It brings tactical combat challenges, puzzels, hard choices to make, exploration, diversity, humor, heart and lore. If you have EVER enjoyed an RPG game it is very unlikely you will dislike this one.\n\nHappy Source hunting.\n\nPeace.","July 11, 2014","true","208.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The engine, graphics, sound and production values are all triple-A quality (for a top-down RPG) which suprised me for a game that came out of a kickstarter campaign. The learning/difficulty curve seems about right (for a non-powergamer playing on normal), with the game being quite challenging at first but after a while the gradual pacing and steady level progression kept me wanting to play. Not to mention the decent exposition and story line that is well above par for the genre. The "classless" system works really well, providing a fair amount of freedom in shaping your source hunters throughout and allowing you to adapt playing style as you discover the magic and combat systems.  The turn based combat is really good, and will appeal to lovers of games like X-Com and Final Fantasy. Can't wait to try out co-op and highly recommend this game to RPG lovers.","January 7, 2015","true","47.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most of all, the game changes based on the decisions you make with how you train your characters, how you approach quests, who's in your party, and more. The story is long and rich, meaning you'll easily get your money's worth on just the first playthrough; and because the game can be quite different each time you play, there's tons of replayability.

For example, if a wooden barricade is blocking your path, you can shoot fire at it, then make it rain to diffuse the fire to continue walking your original path.

But hopefully this will be a good one for those of you on the fence, since this game is not usually on sale. In summary, yes, this game is worth $39.99. No question!\n\nFirst, the positives. For a game funded through Kickstarter and seemingly made under financial duress, the polish is that of a larger publisher's work. There are some aspects of it that do scream "needed more budget," but overall, this is a fine piece of work.\n\nThe gameplay itself is also fun, yet simple. Combat relies a lot on terrain, use of elements, distance, position... for such a seemingly simple setup, the combat can get really creative. You can sneak around and plant oil barrels in preparation for a fight with an invisible character, and then set off a giant explosion with fire. Of course, then fiery oil is everywhere and no one can see anything, and if you use a lot of barrels, you might get caught in the spreading flames. Combat in Divinity is often like this, with crazy sequences.\n\nThe story is also not just a placeholder. It's funny, self-aware, sometimes terrifying. The game doesn't take itself too seriously but it can get very dark. The campy, dark humor is very refreshing, and conversations with NCPs more entertaining than it should be.\n\nThe character creation is very flexible, and at a later point in the game you can even reset your character (!), at the cost of re-quiring all your skillbooks. I haven't got to play CO-OP, but I imagine the reset was for this kind of gameplay.\n\nThere are some negatives, not insignificant. The graphics can be extremely frustrating to target in combat, as the area to click on for enemies actually moves around with the opponent's outline. The UI, especially how items and the stash works, is absolutely cluttered and terrible. The bags you get don't make it any simpler. The other problem is the game likes to use puzzles, and these puzzles are often absolutely opaque. There's no way to figure them out, or the solution is so narrow and specific, you probably would have never thought of it.\n\nThe paper-rock-scissors event to solve disputes between characters is utterly irritating, especially in single play. I imagine in COOP it's probably hilarious. But I don't like that it occurs with NPCs, since it's really just a random chance to overcome your opponent.\n\nThese cons aside, Divinity is a really magical game. It's pretty, it's fun, you can play with a friend (which I will do very soon!) and you won't regret purchasing it, even at full price. Highly recommended!","March 8, 2015","true","170.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's very much an old school RPG, with a large world that doesn't scale to your level, and plenty of complex game mechanics and character customization, in the best RPG fashion. The main plot could've been something more interesting, but then again it's constructed in a way to leave lot of room for personal choice of style, trying its best to avoid black and white morals.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspect of the game is the two main characters, and their possibility to interact and contradict each other. The games uses a rock-paper-scissor social game mechanic to resolve social disputes, which I think earns major extra points: It's a simple mechanic that works really well; much better than a simplistic skill check like in most RPGs.\n\nI personally find the game's crafting mechanics a little bit confusing, but I guess they're built in a way to promote experimentation and trial and error, you'll find crafting instructions within ingame books, but otherwise there's no information on it. Barely anything in manual.\n\nThe best part of the game is the turn-based combat. Really. It fits this genre perfectly. Combat can be very challenging at times, and the game mechanics really take advantage of the turn-based with lots of complexity e.g. regarding the relation of the different magical elements, which affect each other in multitudes of ways creating emergent complexity that leaves a lot of room for creativity. Combat is very much a thinking man's game in Divinity: Original Sin. Large number of combatants can make the fights a bit frustrating at times, but then again, you can save any time, any where, even during combat rounds, so although the fights can be a challenge, you're welcome to save scum your way to victory.\n\nOverall, it's an excellent RPG with old school feel (lots of text to read!), pleasant overall graphics and very solid game mechanics. It's definitely worth the monies if you like old school RPGs and don't mind reading through a lot of text (the dialogue can be a bit bloated at times).","August 11, 2014","true","87.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

From the serious characters to the quirky characters to the crafting and the combat, this game delivers on all counts.  Improving it would be difficult, though not entirely impossible.\n\nTwo things I love about it: 1. Every battle presents some degree of challenge with few exceptions as the adversaries are equally matched to the playable characters.  Even a difference of one level can be devastating (e.g. a level 7 adversary tends to annihilate a level 6 party member).  This does bar access to some regions of the world, but it does so organically.  You can attempt it and fail or you could mark it on your map and return later.\n\n2. All of the skills (special attacks) gained remain useful throughout the game.  In many RPGs, the early skills become useless partway through and/or get replaced by upgraded versions.  In D:OS, they remain pertinent and never get replaced or outclassed by an upgraded version.  This is due to the skills scaling in effect as the characters progress improving their attributes and equipping superior weapons as well as to the old school combat system.  For instance, Minor Heal remains useful later on because its cooldown decreases as Intelligence increases and so, my healer could cast it every single turn by level 13.  I use it while Strong Regenerate cools down and out of combat to quickly recover the party.\n\nOne thing of which to be aware: The game begins slowly and the beginning is not overly engaging.  It is a game that gets better as you play it which has pros and cons.  The pro is that it is wonderful as I said; the con, that many people give up on it early on.  Honestly, I did not play it for a while because it did not engage me as I am accustomed to games doing.  Give it a few hours and once you can leave Cyseal without being murdered by undead, you can really start enjoying it.","January 11, 2015","true","110.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

From the serious characters to the quirky characters to the crafting and the combat, this game delivers on all counts.  Improving it would be difficult, though not entirely impossible.\n\nTwo things I love about it: 1. Every battle presents some degree of challenge with few exceptions as the adversaries are equally matched to the playable characters.  Even a difference of one level can be devastating (e.g. a level 7 adversary tends to annihilate a level 6 party member).  This does bar access to some regions of the world, but it does so organically.  You can attempt it and fail or you could mark it on your map and return later.\n\n2. All of the skills (special attacks) gained remain useful throughout the game.  In many RPGs, the early skills become useless partway through and/or get replaced by upgraded versions.  In D:OS, they remain pertinent and never get replaced or outclassed by an upgraded version.  This is due to the skills scaling in effect as the characters progress improving their attributes and equipping superior weapons as well as to the old school combat system.  For instance, Minor Heal remains useful later on because its cooldown decreases as Intelligence increases and so, my healer could cast it every single turn by level 13.  I use it while Strong Regenerate cools down and out of combat to quickly recover the party.\n\nOne thing of which to be aware: The game begins slowly and the beginning is not overly engaging.  It is a game that gets better as you play it which has pros and cons.  The pro is that it is wonderful as I said; the con, that many people give up on it early on.  Honestly, I did not play it for a while because it did not engage me as I am accustomed to games doing.  Give it a few hours and once you can leave Cyseal without being murdered by undead, you can really start enjoying it.","January 11, 2015","true","110.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Torosir/recommended/230230/","Torosir","Raith","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Torosir/","490 products in account","Absolutely fantastic, game of the year quite easily for me. Hell, I would say that this is easily the game of the new millenium so far, damn near nothing can even remotely come close to how much fun I have had with this game. It might damn near supplant Baldur's Gate 2 as my favorite game of all time.\n\nOk, I've gushed about it enough but I haven't said a damn thing about the game proper. The gameplay is fantastic, this game encourages exploration out the ♥♥♥, there are secrets and easter eggs everywhere. Combat is satisfying and magic is powerful with many great area denial abilities. The story is cliche, but in a good way in my personal opinion. It really feels like a good old fashioned campaign of D&D with great friends (and that one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but you'll figure out which companion that guy is.) Dialogue and writing overall is quite good with plenty of humor and it never really takes itself seriously.\n\nCharacter customization is pretty strong, at least in the vein of what your character can do, not appearance so much. DivOS follows a classless system that is flexible enough to allow for multiclassing to become every bit as powerful as specializing is, though the game does stumble in the area of having a few non-combat skills be mostly useless in many situations. Lockpicking for instance can be very useless, since every chest has a key which can be found via exploration or pickpocketing, or by simply bashing/blasting the chest itself open if you so desire. Now as to customising your characters appearance there are limited options, but at the very least it is possible to dye your armors a different color so that you can look a specific way, though it can be difficult to find enough dyes to get your clothes set.\n\nWhen it comes to loot, DivOS went the randomly generated route. Randomly generated loot has some pros and cons, just like hand place loot does. The cons of randomly generated loot is that to many the loot never really feels special and will often be useless for people in the party and in DivOS that can certainly be the case at times. However I also submit that randomly generated loot encourages exploration every bit as much as hand placed loot does. People often cite Morrowind as an excellent example of the glories of hand placed loot, with many otherwise useless caves holding a valuable artifact that rewards you for exploring it. While certainly true, it is really only rewarding the first time around, since you will always know that that item is there so you always know to go there to get it. Morrowind veterans, myself included, know of dozens of place to get powerful artifacts with minimal effort, and while fun it can rapidly become a ritual for the game, which can swing either way of being great or terrible. DivOS on the otherhand opts for a more Diablo-esque loot system, with randomized loot that encourages you to seek chests and fight bosses for the best stuff which I find to be quite enjoyabe as well. Ultimately I enjoy both systems provided they are done well, I just felt it was something you need to know.\n\nGraphics are perfectly passable and enjoyable, it is always simple to tell what everything is and the art style of the game is quite good with few standout ridiculous armors or weapons, barring most of the robes unfortunately. Sound design is as per usual for all Divinity games absolutely excelent, with an amazing soundtrack made up of  excellently remastered tracks from past divinity games as well as many new tracks. Voice acting, what little there is of it, is enjoyable...at least the first few times you hear it, but it will eventually drive you to hate it, or love it. Personally I have taken to loving some of the idle chatter of some NPCs, and hating others.\n\nGame length is quite satisfying as well, sitting at around 60ish hours from what I understand. I personally took significantly longer since I wound up developing a taste for reloading boss fights to do them over and over again, but I can confidently say that of my 200 hours as of writing only 20 of them were spent on the game back when it was in early access, and I enjoyed all 200 of them a great deal, and look forward to adding more via coop and mods.\n\nI can go on for a while longer, but for the sake of simply ending this review I'll just say that I can't recommend this game enough, Larian created a true classic with this one.","August 2, 2014","true","201.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Divinity: Original Sin. I’ve had my eye on it for a long time, and they released a collector’s edition that comes with 2 copies of the game and both it’s predecessors, plus free launch DLC. So I caved. After playing the game, I definitely see why its still in early access and why save games won’t be carrying over to final release but holy hell is it fun. Its a very diablo-esque dungeon crawler but the combat is turn based, rather than real time and a lot of the different skills play off eachother. For example, I can cast a rain storm over the battlefield which puts out any fires and eliminates the burning status effect. Then my wife casts a chain lightning and it does increased damage to every enemy it hits because they’re in the rain. The combinations are all over the place: oil+fire, water+lightning, theres a bunch. I definitely recommend at least looking into it, if this piques your interest.","June 19, 2014","true","99.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Turn Based nature is so versatile, characters can be so unique, Co-Op is just way beyond what I would have expected and then even more beyond what I could have expected is the Editor that allows everyone to create their own games to freely share with others.  Not since Never Winter Nights have I see this attempted.  It's just amazing all they have been able to complete and I'm so happy to have been able to help Kick Start this wonderful achievement.   I'm still holding off to play more fully until the full release but from testing it all out regularly everything has been improved on steadily and I haven't come accross any  bugs personally.  It all looks beautiful and deep.  I've given to many Kickstarter Campaigns, but this one has really been the best by a long shot in covering all that a Kickstarter campaign should.  I hope many other developers go by their example.  While waiting I've just gotted into Divinity 2 which I somehow missed along the way and it's been a blast too!

It has a fun story and the combat is engaging and mostly deterministic. I've played about 20 hours, and I think I've exhausted the currently available alpha content. I'd like to have an option for a free rotating camera; since everything seems to be fully 3d modeled, I don't see any technical reason not to. It would also be nice to have dialog choices somewhere in between "I hate you and want you to die" and "I love you, let me be your slave forever". Aside from a few small bugs and the above issues, I have no complaints about the game. Definitely worth buying, even if they release the other 80% of the game without fixing any of the issues.\n\nRelease update:\nThe game is still very worth buying. I haven't noticed any of the bugs that I experienced in early access now that it has been released.\nI'm playing multiplayer now and it is loads of fun. Co-operating with a friend adds a whole new dimension to combat. Text chat works well, athough text chat is inherently clunky for this kind of game. I'd reccommend being on skype or teamspeak to play with a friend or three.\nAn option for a free rotating camera has been added (I love you for this Larian Studios) with the caveat that the main compaign wasn't intended to be view from the unlocked angles. I haven't noticed any artifacts yet, but I'm incredibly pleased to have the option even if I did see them.\n\nMinor griefs:\nThe only bug (new; nothing that I saw in EA still exists) that has bothered me is that walking on environmental surfaces seems to tick the environmental damage way too many times. Zombies can walk across their own secreted poision to heal to full and one of my party members walking across a single meter of poision surface might take 5x 10-15 damage ticks and end up almost dead.\nThe multiplayer chat window makes it a bit tough for both players to keep up with the story when only one player gets to see the dialogue play out in the large font, high contrast window (and view what can be said instead of only what is said).\nI initially had trouble getting my friend's companion to bind back to him when reloading; it turns out that companions are configured with the first button on the esc menu. The dialogue options are still very binary, the same as they were during early access.\n\nOverall:\nThe game plays a lot like D&D (4th ed? no daily limits on spells for spellcasters in this) for the computer. If you like D&D then you will probably like Divinity: Original Sin.\nNew campaigns and mods from the dev tools will only make D:OS better.\nThe overall experience is phenomenal. Grab a friend and start playing.","March 22, 2014","true","140.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Probably my first computer gaming experience was Ultima VII. I never finished it. It was too long, I was too young, and it was too hard to get games to run in the first place back then (memory managers? who remembers that crap?). It has, in the rouchly 25 years of gaming since then, been my white whale. I think about it constantly and long to play it again and finally finish it.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin captures so much of what made that game great to me, and so much of what simply doesn't exist in gaming today. It shines creatively, both in a refreshing take on stats/classes/skills/etc, as well as the story. I personally found the graphics to be very good as well. Art is a purely subjective thing to discuss, and I won't say that this game is for everyone. But I will say, if you want a deep role playing experience, turn-based combat, and a pool of nostalgia deep enough to drown in, this is the game for you.","July 12, 2014","true","24.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's very much an old school RPG, with a large world that doesn't scale to your level, and plenty of complex game mechanics and character customization, in the best RPG fashion. The main plot could've been something more interesting, but then again it's constructed in a way to leave lot of room for personal choice of style, trying its best to avoid black and white morals.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspect of the game is the two main characters, and their possibility to interact and contradict each other. The games uses a rock-paper-scissor social game mechanic to resolve social disputes, which I think earns major extra points: It's a simple mechanic that works really well; much better than a simplistic skill check like in most RPGs.\n\nI personally find the game's crafting mechanics a little bit confusing, but I guess they're built in a way to promote experimentation and trial and error, you'll find crafting instructions within ingame books, but otherwise there's no information on it. Barely anything in manual.\n\nThe best part of the game is the turn-based combat. Really. It fits this genre perfectly. Combat can be very challenging at times, and the game mechanics really take advantage of the turn-based with lots of complexity e.g. regarding the relation of the different magical elements, which affect each other in multitudes of ways creating emergent complexity that leaves a lot of room for creativity. Combat is very much a thinking man's game in Divinity: Original Sin. Large number of combatants can make the fights a bit frustrating at times, but then again, you can save any time, any where, even during combat rounds, so although the fights can be a challenge, you're welcome to save scum your way to victory.\n\nOverall, it's an excellent RPG with old school feel (lots of text to read!), pleasant overall graphics and very solid game mechanics. It's definitely worth the monies if you like old school RPGs and don't mind reading through a lot of text (the dialogue can be a bit bloated at times).","August 11, 2014","true","87.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played the original BG and NW series, Icewind Dale my favorite.  This game brings a lot of those rpg and turned-based 4-person squad elements with a fresh take on the open world / roaming environment that feels similar to playing the Ultima series for me. I'm not very far at the time of this post, maybe 15+ hours, and I've enjoyed every moment of it.\n\nThe graphics are easy on the eye at ultra settings on a modest machine.  It defaulted to those on a AMD FX 6300 / Radeon 6800. UI is pretty standard as the come.  The only thing is the, rather important, button on the right which is how you teleport.  Wish that one was more evident... sadly responsible for 30 mins of my play time.\n\nThe way you can split you party is very cool imo.  At one point one of my two main characters was about to die in combat on the next round (surrounded).  If both of your two main characters die you lose and load. (lots of f5/f8)  I fled with my other main character and one side character back to town and was able to regroup in real time while my other main character stayed in combat awiting their return.  I ran the other two back into the fight and was able to prevent his death.  While some may see this as a cheap way out or breaking game mechanics there is also the possibility that those returning character run into another mob and I would have two seperate battles to wage, or manage to merge them back into one.\n\nYour characters have conversations with the party that you control. Doesn't really have a place in the SP mode (although it does change stats in some cases) and you can turn it off in the options but in MP mode it comes into play as if you don't agree with the person your playing with you can argue and try to intimiate/charm/reason with them.  And finally a draw will bring rock-paper-scissors to decide it all.  Another new element that I am indifferent on but for the record have yet to play multi.\n\nCrafting is a nice addition.  You learn your recipes by book reading and from there it's a drag-and-drop process mostly.  However keeping all the ingredients can get messy in the inventory.\n\nSoudtrack is quite enjoyable and the audio is well done.  VOs are ok, but honestly very few make it immersive.  The main story is not bad so far but I've been bouncing all over the place with side quests and have much more to do.\n\nIt's one of those "what's over there?" games that makes you hate the next day at work from lack of sleep.  I would give it a 9 or 10.  I bought it at $40, I'd do it again.","July 22, 2014","true","75.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Please ignore all of the grammar and spelling mistakes, I wrote this review when I was waay to tired)\n\nAnyways, I can defenatly recommend this game. At first I was skeptical, since I'm not one for Top-Down view games. Especially when there is turned based combat. But after the first few hours or so I just started loving this game, and I don't think I'm even a quarter through it.\nSo like I said its a top-down view game, wher you can move your character either by holding the left mouse button and then draging it in the direction that you want to move in, or my simply clicking on anywhere in the area.\n\nThe combat is turned baste, which at first was a "meh" thing for me since turned baste games are a "meh" kind of thing but after an hour or two it just became something that was there and I accepted it, so its defenatly not a negative aspect for me. I haven't really figured out what decides the order of when each character goes, but so far my characters were all ways the first ones (yay). Similar to other games with turne based combat, you have AP which decides what and how much you can do per turn. So if you need to move in order to dash at the enemy because a big rock is in the way, both of those things will cost AP. If you level as specific skill from your Characters, you will get more starting AP. And if you just simply do nothing and skip a characters turn, or you do something which doesnt require a lot of AP, the left over AP gets added to your next turn.\n\nNow at the beginning of the game you can go into a Tutorial Dungeon, where you will already get to learn quit a few of the games mechanics, LIKE LIGHTING TORCHES (I love little things like these). You can move boxes and barrels around to find a hidden key under neath that may unlock a chest or a door. You can use the environment to your advantage in combat. For example there are barrels that have poisen in them, you can move them into position so that when you enter combat all you need to do is shoot them with an arrow (or something equivallent) to make them explode. Now of course you could already explode the barrels even before you enter combat, to already deal damage to your enemies.\nYou also have to look around real carefully for traps or hidden loot.\n\nBut even outside of the Dungeons and inside the Towns you can do a lot of stuff. For example, you can brake into other people homes and steal their stuff, all though you have to be carefull because if you get cought there will be consequences.\nYou can trade with pretty much anyone, and all most everyone will have something to sell to you, or you can sell anything to them. The trading in this game is pretty good to, you don't necessarily don't need to pay for the Items with Gold. If you have some spare equipment that you don't need, you can use that to pay for the Items. Making your useless crap into...something...more...usefull.....yea.\n\nLike someone ells have probably already said, you need to talk to different people in order to get your quests, so no exclamation marker above peoples heads to tell you where a quest is to be found. Which is actually pretty cool and something new. And for me it draws and immerses me more into the game.\n\nYou are also able to use your abilities (like becoming invisible) in order to accomblish different things.\n\nWhen you create a new game you get to customise two characters, meaning you will have two main characters that you can switch between (and later you can also switch between other party memebers that you pick up). Again at first it was a "meh" thing for me but I have gotten used to it and I actually quit like it now since I can have a Mage and a Rouge. Though you can also teach both characters both things, so the starting class that you pick is just more of a specialisation rather then a locked in character class. When you are talking to a NPC and they give you a choice, you sometimes need to defend your choice from your parters choice by a simple game of rock-paper-scissors. And who ever wins, their choice will be take. So if you say "Kill them all" but your partner says "Spare them all" and you play the game of rock-paper-scissors and you win, that means that you and your partner will kill every person/enemy there. There are also stats that influence of how quickly and easaly you can win these little games.\nThe writing/story of this game, for me, has ben pretty good so far. Though its best if you find that out yourself, or look at a few videos.\n\nI can't comment on the Co-Op part of this game yet, since I haven't played this game with a friend up until now, but I'm sure if you enjoy the single player like me then you will definitly love the co-op. Though I would recommend playing it with a friend that is also interested to hear the story, and not just goofing off killing every body (though in a second play through there is nothing standing in your way of doing that of course).\n\nSo do I recomend this game, hell yes. At first I was skeptical about it, with the top down and turn based thing and all, but after a few hours I can definitly say that this game has become one of my favorit games. And the RPG element in this game is pretty awesome.","July 27, 2014","true","26.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Few things to mention:\n\nGame is linear believ it or not. Yeah, nobody tells you what to do, but the enemies mark a specific pattern which is their level, if you are not leveled enough which most of the time, finds itself into a linear pattern, then you cannot go beyond the enemies of the same level than you, as they are incredible strong even if they are one level above you.\n\nGame is gore as hell, that's amazing.\n\nLots of interesting spells and ways to manage them.\n\nThe game gets absolutelly repetitive by the end, and the ending right now is horrible. Apparently the definitive edition will improve on many things, like voice acted dialogue and improved ending, improved spells.

That being said Divinity: Original Sin (DOS) is hands down the best RPG I've played in recent years from a gameplay perspective. I'd recommend this game to anybody who enjoys the RPG genre, as it will not let you down. I've taken my first taste of a Divinity title and now all I want is more; with more multiplayer components and systems that support 4-player (or even 6-8 players) out of the box.\n\nThe turn-based gameplay is absolutely perfect; the classes (that you can completely customize yourself) are diverse and fun to play, leaving a lot of replay value in the game although the campaign itself is massive enough alone. Graphically the game looks great and after a quick graphic-streaming fix in the game files it ran seamlessly at 144FPS 2560x1440 resolution.\n\nI'd heavily recommend a decent 4-player mod or 4-player edit as with 4 people the game is even more fun; though by itself it would still offer people a good experience. Even with the massive content rich evnironment myself and all those I know who love this game are left craving more; different campaigns from the communities and DLC from the developers bringing us new campaigns!","February 14, 2015","true","59.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My best friend bought it for me, but my backlog of games was so long I didn't want to waste a few hours on yet another fantasy RPG. I was sure I would be disappointed and annoyed by the experience. To top it off, the game was early access, and I dislike early access games with a passion.\nSo, I didn't touch it. I ignored it. Which, honestly, was a mistake.\n\nWhen I did pick it up, it was at my significant other's behest. We could play it together, so if I didn't like it, he would know why. I gave it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised. The graphics were lovely, but honestly, graphics stopped being important to me after Aion seduced me and stomped all over me. The sounds were nice, too, but I don't value sound in a game. What really sold me in the first hour I played was the gameplay.\n\nMost of my experience in my 10 years of gaming has been with MMOs, which are the epitome of copy and paste combat. No matter if you fight a fire elemental or the king of skeletons, you have a rotation, and it doesn't really change fight to fight. Divinity: Original Sin blasts that concept out of the water. There is no rotation in Divinity: Original Sin. If you try to use the same tactics, fight to fight, you won't defeat enemies. Moreover, most of your attacks will create new environments for you to take advantage of. Finally, a game where you have an effect on your surroundings and the surroundings effect you. Before Divinity: Original Sin, I hated the concept of turn-based combat in video games; I thought it slowed the pacing down in a way that broke immersion. In Divinity, it's completely necessary and appropriate. You will need a turn-based system and a slower pacing in order to plan and adjust to the constantly changing combat situation. This is a system of gameplay that rewards thought and creativity.\n\nWhile the amazing gameplay was what hooked me, what got me to stay was the writing. It's not Shakespeare, but goodness it's fun and light and enjoyable. I'm not going to experience a life changing experience from revelations inspired by this game, but I do laugh and care what will happen next, and that's a whole lot more than I can say for most games. I have to admit, I skip dialogue in Skyrim and most other games because I don't really tend to care about the details. I read every little word in Divinity, even if it's a dumb skill book, because it's fun and funny and interesting.\n\nAnd, well, the most important thing to me in most games are multiplayer interactions. Is it worthwhile to have a friend along? Is interacting with said friend beneficial to gameplay? Am I going to still like my friend after playing this game with them? The answers respectfully are yes, yes, and yes. Even typically arduous and painful aspects of dual player games have been streamlined to be barely noticable. Is your buddy too far away from you? Teleport to them. Do you need to trade something to your buddy but they're across the map? Just right click the item to send it to them. Are you mad at your buddy? Hit them with lightning. It's like the developers played multiplayer games before and learned the common pitfalls of playing them, then decided to get rid of the annoyances.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game is honestly tiny. The reason I rated the UI 3/5 isn't because of the skill bar or the minimap. I'm simply annoyed that the camera angles are fixed to a small range of positions. It makes it hard to loot some items or spot some details. Most of the time, you can work around it by hitting ALT, but it's hard to interact with some things if they're close to a positionally challenged wall nevertheless.\n\nYeah, it's worth the money.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Enkazadas/recommended/230230/","Enkazadas","Enkazadas The Indomitable","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Enkazadas/","1114 products in account","Almost all of my hours in this game were spent in the first zone, because I played the game as soon as it showed up with a freind of mine. I enjoyed it a lot, but after a while it began to wear on me. I did the same stuff over, and over, and over again and while I had fun for the most part, it began to bore me with how, sometimes, the game had so few choices.\n\nsometimes there's two or three ways to complete things with minimal differences, which don;t make much of an impact on the story. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. You can send a bunch of imps to get killed by a demon and your freind imp just gets a little mad and carries on like nothing happened. Or, you can lose a game of ♥♥♥♥ING ROCK PAPER SCISSORS and have an entire town turn on you.\n\nThere have been at least ten different occasions where I, having the upper hand in the persuasion arguement, lose despite having DOUBLE the stat of the other person, and then have an entire town attack me. Now, you might say, that if i was to save then that wouldn't be a problem - and sure, but most of the time I didn't even know it was coming!\n\nThe game encourages save-scumming, trial and error, and luck. You can do the same persuasion twenty times and win none of them in spite of better stats, and then do it again and win without a fuss. It's INCREDIBLY dumb. On top of this, the multiple choices in this game seldom serve to do anything except have an incredibly mild effect on the game, bar one that could SINGLE HANDEDLY LOSE YOU THE GAME in the second act.\n\nExploration isn't an option so much as a necesity. You HAVE to explore, you HAVE to do everything, because otherwise you are going to Die. Again, and again, and again, and again, and again. You won't have the levels, the gear, or the spells to suceed. Save every five seconds, because sometimes a pack fo seven enemies will just appear and kill you from nowhere, without warning, and you'll die. Now, you might think that because you know where they are you can attack THEM first! Nope. They're not in the game until you trigger the event. There's no way to pre=trigger the ambushes. You will just... have to get ambushed.\n\nI had to restart the entire game multiple times because i died to something i had no knowledge of, and lost HOURS of progress because i was in town or picking up quests and then stumbled across something far too strong for me. Merchants inventories only change when they level up, so good luck finding what you want in the late game.\n\nI still like the game.\n\nThe characters are pretty alright. Some are kinda interesting, some are forgettable and some are memorable, like the Cheese Vendor who me and my freind quote every now and again. SOme quests are silly and fun, and are a nice little diversion from the main quest (when you actually figure out what the main quest is). The game has a lot of lore, and a lot of crafting (not that you'll ever need to craft apart from some very specific circumstances that require no crafting skill) and enemies are generally varied and interesting (except for the Immaculates and Orcs, and to a small extent the Goblins)\n\nThe enviroments are awesome, seeing spells used is awesome (except from scrolls, which crash the game), and using summons, using tactical combat, and using different builds makes each playthrough fresh (until late in the game where you realise that, you can only use a very small set of builds that basically do the same thing and everything else is terrible and going to get you killed with no warning or reasoning)\n\nDivinity is Mixed for me. Yes, i'd say you should play it, and play it with a freind most importantly. I'd even reccomend using a guide too, so you can minimise the sheer ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t of some of the things you run into. But some mobs are colossaly strong with no clear exploitable weakness or strategy to beating them, some things like the rock paper scissors persuasion system lead to hours of frustration and unfairness, and the density of mobs, while normally nicely paced, can get frustratingly grouped in later areas.\n\nDon't play this game to 100% it. The end of the game is... lackluster, honestly. If you want to play it, and you should, play with a freind, or just play for fun with a guide and take it slowly, reading everything, doing every quest, and never trying to go too far ahead of the path. Explore everything, do everything, and most of all have fun. The game doesn't really bear replay value as the different choices don't affect much, if anything, and expect some quests to fail because of RNG. Most of all - don't expect the game to be easy.\n\nI enjoyed Divinity, but i won't play it again. Perhaps the Extended Edition will fix my problems","May 21","true","95.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I want to impress upon you exactly how this game made me feel. I was a bit undecided at first; an ARPG style, turn-based combat, story-driven game with so much dialogue. At first I thought about how terrible this could go but then I thought about how epic it could be as well.\n\nUpon buying, and trying, Divinity I wasn't all that impressed. It is as if my initial preceptions of the game carried on "into" the game. The game felt a bit slow at first but picked up pace dramatically as I gained the power to start exploring the first area. By the end of the first section I was completely in love with this game and how the combat works. The story is drizzled on thick like syrup on pancakes.\n\nTL:DR Skip here\n\nThe combat in the game is slow at first but picks up pace. What I mean to say is, at early level you are extremely limited on choices for your characters. Being unable to make a lot of combos makes combat seem... unexciting. But, as you gain levels, gear, and skills/abilities, your strategic choices explode exponentially. The difference between 1-5 is like the difference between checkers and chess.\n\nThe quests can be completed in multiple ways. You can chose to do step 3 before step 2, or even step 1, and start the quest there. The outcomes can be different, which changes the story a lot. There is tons of secret stuff to find in this game if you are interested in that sort of thing. The way they hide tiny little keys and npcs is extrodinary.\n\nIn light of everything it is not a perfect game. As I have said before, combat is slow. Strategic combat can be both frustrating and boring. If you don't catch onto how spells work together early on you won't leave the starting area. The story dialogue is great in some areas and, in other areas, written like a low budget vampire flick. And, the dialogue can drag on.. and on... and on.\n\nFor 40 dollars though and the ability to close dialogue boxes, you would be worse off not having tried this game. If you are a fan of old school rpgs, and wish you had one designed for a modern audience. Then you have struck gold with Divinity. I don't know that I would give it a 9/10 but it scores at least a 7/10. This game is worth it for the money.","August 25, 2014","true","50.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I am writing an early review of what I think of this game so far. I do recommend this game, although I will talk about both what I find good and bad.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin has a turn-based combat system. I find this combat style was very well done. It is difficult to choose the wrong place to attack if you are paying attention, and it takes strategy to get through the battles. They certainly are not battles that you want to rush into.\n\nHowever, there is certainly a lot of difficulty early on in Divinity: Original Sin. I currently am Level 3 and Level 3 creatures are very difficult for me. I do rely on my cleric and healing potions a lot to get through them, and even then a party member dies usually. So it is not a game for a casual player who wants to feel above the opposition. Although it is fun, and makes me think I should be more tactical before I turn a corner, and check for enemies.\n\nOne issue I have is that quests rely heavily on what is in the dialogue between the characters, because the Journal you have does not depict location well at all and there are no markers. An example is searching for a Church of Legionnaires, and I do not know where this Church is and the Journal does not tell me where to go. It gets very confusing with the amount of dialogue you do before you get around to doing the quests.\n\nAlthough, the amazing variety of things to do is awesome. If you explore the first city enough, you manage to find qhat seems to be a second main questline that over-arcs everything. On the surfac, it seems like a lot of fun. A very confusing puzzle to piece togetehr as I play and go through this murder-mystery / source-hunting main quest line. Exploring more into the first main questline also opens up the door to more allies to add to your pack, something that becomes very useful early on due to the difficulty of battles.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin after only a few hours seems like such an amazing game. The story is intriguing and catches your interest, and the amount of stories raveled together layered as such makes me want to pour more of my time into it. The combat is fluent and makes you think and act slowly to survive, and when you do level-up it really feels like you have accomplished something.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you think you can handle the difficulty and amount of dialogue.\n\n","July 9, 2014","true","13.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RIMBAD/recommended/230230/","RIMBAD","Rim Bot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RIMBAD/","83 products in account","Divinity: Original Sin is the latest entry in the Divinity series of games, chronologically following Divinity: Dragon Commander and preceeding the events of Divine Divinity.  It is also an unbelievably good game and you should play it immediately.\n\nMaybe I should explain.\n\nOriginal Sin chronicles the tale of two Source Hunters, inquisitorial figures who have been granted vast authority by the Council of Seven, as they travel the world of Rivellon.  The premise is well-trod in other games; crusaders questing to destroy dark Sourcerers, who must face dire threats while keeping themselves from becoming the very monsters they yadda yadda yadda.\n\nBut this is a Divinity game.  This is the direct sequel to the game wherein you played an army commander who was also a dragon wearing a jetpack.\n\nRivellon is an incredible world to explore- one part hilarious, one part tragic, two parts engrossing.  After you've made your way through the tomb which serves as a tutorial, the game world is simply open, the tasks blinking in your journal neither pushing nor pulling.  In our playthrough, my friend and I have found ourselves moving through the world like water; taking the most interesting paths of least resistance and criss-crossing the map in crazed fashion.  Against the backdrop of a town Councillor's murder, we helped a cat find love, or fought the ghosts of pirates, or battled our way slowly through a monsterous hellscape on a whim.  Every screen has something noteworthy taking place on it, even if it's not immediately obvious what,  and NPC conversations, dialogue, environmental cues and short in-game books are meshed seamlessly into a dramatic and intriguing whole.\n\nAs far as the cliche-sounding plotline goes, the story may surprise you.  Nearly as soon as the mundane primary quests begin, they are interwoven with a metaplot on a cosmic level- but they remain fulfilling and well-done stories.  Every named character has a tale, and many of them are well-developed and emotional enough to give you an unusual sense of connection to the character.  After a few hours into the story, the game washes its hands of any responsibility it has to give you moral cues, and it pulls no punches with the complexity of the situations you're forced to resolve on a whim.  Lives and fortunes often depend upon a moment's indecision, and entire populations can be decimated due to a loss at rock-paper-scissors.\n\n(I did remind you that this was a Divinity game.  How else would you resolve social conflicts?)\n\nIt might be more helpful to think of Divinity: Original Sin as a complex and interwoven series of events rather than a quest.  Most of the situations throughout the world are resolvable through several vectors, and the whole narrative can shift and adapt as you resolve things 'out of order' or shank a hapless character who caught you pawing through their storeroom.  Plots and schedules in the game world exist with some degree of independance- so when I accidentally set a fishing boat on fire and was forced to slay all of the enraged dockworkers, I cut away the thread which would have led me to the location of the mutineer who'd stolen a valuable artifact... but I came across him later anyway.\n\nSpeaking of killing, combat in this game is interesting in a way I've seldom seen before.  Proper fights are turn-based, and unbelievably dynamic and well-balanced.  No abilities are lost on the live-time overworld, however, and so encounters can be started after hurling a fireball at an unwitting group, or re-arranging the scenery to form barricades.  Fights are dangerous affairs- the game does not beleive in pulling punches, and being outnumbered is a threat which must be countered with cunning tactics and even emergant changes of planning.\n\nNo more dangerous than the world itself, though.  Rivellon is riddled with traps, puzzles and (well) riddles, and a lapse in attention can mean the death of even an over-levelled party.  Death is a serious matter- ressurection scrolls are real, but rare, and even those won't help you if your entire party goes up in flames.  This is a key element of the game; that the things happening on-screen are things you have to pay attention to, lest you walk blithely into the basement of a paranoid trap-maker or idly break a barrel full of oil while an open fire is alight nearby.\n\nFinally, the multiplayer element is excellent.  While (by default, anyway) only two people can play the same game, each one has full control over a character, and frequent opportunities for choices by each player helps to tailor the character to fit both desires.  The game's plot is built with a dual protagonist in mind, and teamwork is absolutely required in even the most routine battles.  Best of all, the game's interconnectivity system allows players to swap items or teleport to the other in a flash, giving each hero freedom to wander the world map while retaining the ability to show up and participate in combat.\n\nAre there problems with this game?  Of course, but they're blessedly minor.  The game has a few more bugs than you might expect, and load times between areas are long.  It's also easy to skip side-quests, and some of the more important ones contain puzzles sufficiently obscure to create serious problems for some players- plus, though the game lets you do what you want and ignore what you don't, skipping the wrong side-quests can cause serious problems later on.  Finally, the game's NPCs have a solid reprotoire of relevant and witty dialog... which they will repeat, ad infinitum.  This can quickly come to grate on the senses, and I have legitimately killed NPCs merely to make them shut up.\n\nStill, these substantive quibbles are minor.  Divinity: Original Sin, is one of the most solid RPG titles which I've seen in years, and more fun to boot.","July 6, 2014","true","54.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game does not hold hands. You have to investigate, analyze, think, and process the data that are spread around the world.\n2. You will be greeted with lots of texts. Rather than pushing away, they pull you into the story. You don't hear much voice work but the words written are enough to draw you into the story....along with many hints and clues. You will need them all.\n3. Combat is turn based, but assuming you are not playing on easy difficulty, this game will challenge your skill. Strategize and plan. Succeed and rip rewards; fail and face consequences...\n4. Fantastic visuals. The world is littered with lots of items that you can interact with. Use them for your benefits, or to earn some extra gold, or perhaps, use to solve puzzle that you are not even aware of will appear later.\n5. Loot, loot, loot!\n6.

Name the last time a you could break down a locked door using your sword at the cost of the sword's durability.  Or how about using a chill spell in the rain to freeze an ally in order to give them a massive physical defense boost?  Sure they can't move, but it keeps them alive until the healing spell cools down.  Ever done that? No?  How about using one character to distract a guard while the other pickpockets them?  Probably not.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin creates a massive web of mechanics and options to give players incredible amounts of power and balances that by making everything ♥♥♥♥ing hard.  Oh, and friendly fire is always on. Don't worry, there's a quick save for when you blow yourself up.\n\nIt's not all serious, though.  In fact, most of the sidequests are absolutely hilarious.  The first fighter's guild you join is a pyramid scheme.  If you choose the talent that lets you talk to animals, there's a fortune telling bull.\n\nThis game is amazing.

Larian has always seemed, to me at least, like a studio with great ideas, but limited execution. With Original Sin however, they have absolutely smashed that perception of them. This game is no less than a masterpiece.\n\nThe story is fairly rich, with deep characters, that have their own motives and personalities. It's also pretty damn funny, with many conversations (and in-game books) having genuine laugh-out-loud moments. The combat is intuitive, and well worked, although there are one or two small bugs with it when playing co-operatively, but nothing game or immersion breaking.\n\nThe co-op is where this game shines more than most. It is simple, old fashioned, damn good fun. Co-op combat is great, with each player able to feel an important part of the battle, and using abilities to destroy your enemies together is great fun, for example; one player creates a pool of oil beneath your foe, the other then lights it on fire, or perhaps one player teleports an enemy up into the air, before slamming them down into the ground... right in front of your ally, and their massive sword. It rocks, on every level.\n\nSo, long story short, if you like rpg's that inherit much from baldur's gate and neverwinter, like your games to be fun and funny in equal measure, enjoy co-op or just enjoy beating things in the head, this is a fantastic game. If you don't like any of those things, then this review probably isn't for you, because anyone that hipster would never do anything so mainstream as to read a review.\n\nBuy it if you like things.","April 29, 2014","true","18.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game does not hold hands. You have to investigate, analyze, think, and process the data that are spread around the world.\n2. You will be greeted with lots of texts. Rather than pushing away, they pull you into the story. You don't hear much voice work but the words written are enough to draw you into the story....along with many hints and clues. You will need them all.\n3. Combat is turn based, but assuming you are not playing on easy difficulty, this game will challenge your skill. Strategize and plan. Succeed and rip rewards; fail and face consequences...\n4. Fantastic visuals. The world is littered with lots of items that you can interact with. Use them for your benefits, or to earn some extra gold, or perhaps, use to solve puzzle that you are not even aware of will appear later.\n5. Loot, loot, loot!\n6.

I'd play for hours exploring a new world, despite the lousy graphics (compared to today at least), and not even notice time slipping by. As I've grown older, my responsibilities have grown as well and I've learned to keep a closer eye on the clock so I can get to bed at a decent hour. I've also gotten so used to new games that it's hard for a game to really invoke my sense of wonder and excitement.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin is the first game in a long time to undo all of that. I'm nowhere near finishing it but the gameplay and story and graphics and everything are perfect. Every time I turn it on, I'm drawn into the game so deep that the outside world doesn't exist for a time. When I finally emerge from this finely crafted world and notice the time, I discover I've suddenly lost 6 or more hours of my life. I can no longer play this game on a week night because it guarantees I'll get 5 hours of sleep or less before I have to head to work the next day. Setting an alarm is useless because I'll unconsciously turn off the alarm without even being distracted from the game...\n\nI could write more about this game and how amazing it is but it's hard to find the right words. Here's a few things of note though:\n\nThere are no quest markers on the map. If you don't pay close attention to the story and the world, you can easily leave quests unfinished. While some might complain that it makes it too hard, it's also part of what makes the game so immersive. Plus the challenge of deciphering clues to progress is a lot of fun in and of itself.\n\nThe music is fantastic. The easter eggs are hilarious. The graphics are gorgeous. The combat is both fun and challenging which is a hard combo to pull off. And despite the turn based nature, combat still somehow feels surprisingly fast paced.\n\nI do have 1 negative comment. The conversation minigame for when 2 characters disagree is annoying to me. The first time or two I thought it was cool but after that... it got old fast. Especially in a single player game where I'm forced to either have both my characters always agree or I have to play a minigame where I may or may not get the actual outcome I want. In co-op it's even more annoying because I'd rather make a decision through actual conversation with my partner than through an a repetitive mini-game. When using the game to convince NPCs of something, it's perfect but when the two main characters are making a decision, it annoys me. I'd also like it if during conversations in co-op the second player could have more interaction that just reading chat bubbles over the other players head. Especially because if one player clicks too fast, the other doesn't even get a chance to read them. Other than that, I love this game. And even this little issue isn't enough to stop me from playing.","July 16, 2014","true","38.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game is played in real-time but the battles are turn-based, with great elemental and landscape interactions. The world itself wonderfully drawn--a nice combination between pretty landscapes and cartoonish monsters. The music is awesome and I enjoy the voicing (I talk to the rats more often than necessary because it makes me giggle). The price is well worth the amount of content for the game ($40). (Edited to add--finished the game at ~91 hours. Awesome value for dollar). The story is engrossing and you make many choices along the way that affect your gameplay. In fact, beware; choices are permanent and have consequences. If you choose to shoot an NPC in the face with a fireball in broad daylight...well, I recommend you save often in case you need to roll back after some instant regret.\n\nThe puzzles in this game can be hard, and the most difficult aspect is likely the fact that you have to pay attention to EVERYTHING--there's a lot of story and the game expects you to listen and learn. If you get confused or lost (which happened to us...erm, often....) you might get a little frustrated. Consider all of your actions, pay attention to story and quests, put care into where you put your skill points, and you'll be fine.\n\n\nMy complaints are small: inventory can become unwieldy, and some of the puzzles are hard (or require patience levels that I don't possess). However, the sheer fun of this game more than makes up for the small bugs and there are a lot of surprises waiting inside this game\n\nI give it a 10/10 for co-op.","July 17, 2014","true","111.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

What really makes it awesome, is that it relies on a sort of "old school" methodology when it comes to combat and questing. I think that is what sets it apart from so many other games, and in a good way. This game is not easy, but at the same time, I wouldn't say that its unfairly difficult. As long as you take the time to understand the mechanics, it won't be too bad. It really makes the player analyze each encounter, and use that knowledge to be better prepared for future fights.\n\nThe game's combat is turn base, so that might put some people off, but I personally think thats part of the reason the game is so great. It gives you the freedom to stop and think instead of rushing into a fight.\n\nAnother point I mentioned, was the questing system. This game is totally free of hand holding, so you really need to use your head to figure out the quests, you actually need to talk to the NPC's and explore the environment to have any chance of completing them. (Get petpal ASAP!)\n\n"Player choice" and "Freedom" are terms often used to describe games, but usually I feel, most games fall short of allowing the player to really play the game how they want. With Divinity: OS, this is not the case, you really can play the game how you want. If you want to kill the starting NPC's that give you the first quests, you can do it. There is no set path that you are supposed to follow, you can really play the game how you want.\n\nLastly, I just want to mention that somethings are hard to figure out when first playing the game. For instance, you will want to save up ability points so you can unlock better skills instead of spending them right away. Certain things like this can be tough to figure out, so I would recommend reading some beginner guides online first. There are some great ones on Steam already. Past the basic stuff, I wouldn't read anything else online though, part of the fun of this game is figuring stuff out on your own.\n\n\nHonestly, this is one of the best games I have ever played. I don't think I've been this engrossed in a game in years. If you like RPG's and rewarding/challenging games, please get this game, it really is amazing.","July 20, 2014","true","95.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But the environment makes it also more dangerous to use them.\nIt's crazy how they've thought of everything and it makes it hard to not hurt your own party.\n\nThe game doesn't have guidelines and quest markers. All you have is a journal, that gets updated with things you've discovered but there's still no clear answer as to where to go or what to do. This is something you have to find out yourself.\n\nThe coop feature has made it more fun as i've been playing this with my brother and we've been trying figuring out what to do most of the time.

Even with my negative points below I still recommend it for people who like RPG+Turn based battles, if you liked games like Baldur’s Gate series then you will likely enjoy this game.\n\nGood:\n+Great Graphics.\n+Moody atmosphere for dungeons.\n+Talk/trade with almost every neutral NPC.\n+Developers are listening to players and updates/patches are coming out frequently.\n\nNot so Good:\n-Inventory management is clunky.  Yes you can use "Send to Homestead" but I would love to see an option to access it from anywhere as well as quick transfer, say CTRL+left click to transfer to Homestead.\n-Enemy visual range is so large that often you’re in battle before you can even see them.  Once in battle you often have to move the map around just to spot the enemy, since they are so spread out.\n-Quest tracking.  I know this was their intent but the lack of any visual clues and limited suggestions in quest log can make questing painful and slow.  I’ve spend a large amount of my time running between people in town asking the same questions and hoping for a different answer or quest update.  If there were better visual clues (pointer) or more details in quest log on what is expected next I wouldn’t feel some much like I’m wasting time running around.\n-Movement speed, I know this is subjective but for me I feel like the characters move too slowly even at max speed.\n-So far with my limited play it seems like the enemy count is too low on the maps, i.e. only one or two groups of enemies per map area.","July 4, 2014","true","85.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you liked the classic Ultima or Fallout series you will love this game. You have utmost freedom in creating your characters and classes. The combat is turned based, ala Xcom. What makes the combat great is the interaction of elements. Make it rain, and opponents get wet. If you now hit them with a ice spell they get frozen. This opens up countless of possible combinations. The story is a bit fantasy cliche, but the world is lovingly crafted, quirky and very immersive. The best part is that it has coop, which is a blast. Your coop partner can literally disagree with you in-game when you speak to NPCs, and change the outcome of a quest.\n\nThe Bad: The game does not hold your hands, aside from a small tutorial dungeon in the beginning. There are no quest markers, and little to no explanation about its stats system. Little dialog is spoken, so lots of dialog reading is required to know how to finish quests. If you are the impatient type and are looking for an action-rpg, look elsewhere.\n\nVerdict: Game of the year for me so far. This illustrates nicely what kind of games are possible when developers don't have ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ publishers breathing down their necks about dumbing down or streamlining their games.","August 2, 2014","true","52.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","4"

No more blindly following the big arrow on the screen, you'll have to look for clues and read books\n+ 80-100h to beat\n+ number of skills\n+ secondary quests\n\n- difficulty drop at mid-game. Once you understand buff/debuff and have a basic sense of tactic, It gets easy.\n- the inventory\n- lack of companions\n\n\nSo, I recommend this game. I backed it on kickstarter, and I do not regret it. The game, in its mechanics, is challenging, and far from the current videogame standards. You will have to consults your quests journal, use common sense to resolve puzzles (they are not that difficult really, except when you have to look for a *******ing button hidden in shadows or behinda leaf) , look for clues, read every piece of paper or book you find. No quest markers, If you don't know what to expect, you can feel a bit lost there.\n\nCombats are great. Really. a bit hard at the beginning. You really have to pay attention to things like initiative, speed, perception, how 2 spells will work together ... It is really a pleasure to begin some chain reaction when combining different elements. Unfortunately, once you understand how it works, how you can buff/debuff, use initiative order and combine elements, you are pretty unstoppable. There is a huge drop in difficulty at mid game. Even the end boss was more "long to kill" than "hard to kill" . It can make the game a bit borng, because the main storyline, is not really that interesting (I did not say it sucks , but it's average)\n\nConcerning the 2 main characters: I liked the rock/paper/scissors system used here, and how you can make your characters disagree on anything :d\n\nA word on crafting: depending on your mele/casting orientation it can be useful. There are a lot of recipe that can help at the beginning of the game, but mostly, at some point, you only use it to craft mage skillbooks and add resistance to your equipments. The mechanic is interesting and relies on logic (combining item to create stuff, like "I use my dagger to sharpen this branch, I get a stake) but it comes with a price: the inventory is not really practical, as everything can be an ingredient for crafting (but you get used to it)\n\nNB: I did not test co-op","August 3, 2014","true","160.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is an early, first impressions review. I shall amend this upon further venturing into the game.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin is Larian Studio’s latest addition to the Divinity series, going back to its roots as a turn-based RPG set in an open world with unlimited possibilities. You control two customizable characters, who arrive on an Island chasing down sorcerers, fighting off orcs, and investigating the reports of undead activity in the area. Quirky and engaging, Larian’s Kickstarter darling is a welcome addition to anyone’s game library.\n\nOriginal Sin starts you off by letting you customize your two playable characters. You can change their class, appearance, and even their initial stats, if you wish. There are numerous options to choose from, with the classes ranging from fighter to wayfarer, offering varied styles of play, but can probably be grouped into three major roles (coinciding with the three voice pack choices in game): rogue, warrior, and wizard. There are many roles that min-max certain skill sets, while others act as a blend between two major roles. Overall, there is enough variety here to cater to different play styles. Cosmetic customization is also rich, with options to change gender, hair, voice, skin tone, face, and portrait all available.\n\nThe game features a very neat art style and visual aesthetic. The world of Original Sin is colourful, vivid, and full of life. The trees sway gently, torches burn brightly, and water flows smoothly – the world feels dynamic and active with every little detail added in. The quality of the game’s graphics is astoundingly good, while also being somewhat efficient – it runs on Ultra by default on my GTX 765M, and I’ve had no issues with it dropping below 30, usually floating at the 40s on FRAPS. The art style is akin to a more realistic Torchlight – colours pop out and everything is somehow cartoonish, but it definitely feels like a believably real representation of its world.\n\nCombat in Original Sin goes about in a turn-based, action point oriented style. It is reminiscent of other classic RPGs such as Fallout 1 and 2. Certain actions cost a certain amount of AP, movement AP cost is dependent on distance (in meters, unsure if you can change this to the empirical format) and certain units are given priority to move first. Various stats affect what weapons and armor you can equip, how certain skills work for your character, hit chance, dodge chance, and inventory space. So far, the combat flows nicely, and is quite enjoyable. One of the more noticeable breaks from the usual AP system is that any unused AP in a turn is carried over, adding more options for your later turns.\n\nA major part of Original Sin is interaction with its various characters, with special focus between the two player characters. Often times, when a decision is to be made, your characters exchange dialog, with each option affecting certain traits of the characters, such as their persuasion, obedience, and altruism.\n\nSo far, with roughly two hours in, Original Sin is showing plenty of signs of a good game, and I will definitely invest more time in it to further develop my opinion. It seems like the game is made for coop, with two players controlling one character each. I can see that playing out fairly well, with hilarious results in the inter-character dialog! Overall, I would say that if you were already interested in the game, it wouldn’t be such a bad idea to get it, especially if you have a friend playing it as well.\n","July 3, 2014","true","6.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You have the freedom to do what you want and how do you want.\nThere are plenty of dialogs, similar to Planescape Torment, and you dont have a quest marker, you need to read the journal.

Combat is a mix between Baldur's Gate II and Temple of Elemental Evil, which is a great thing, especially if you are a fan of those games as I am.  Spell system works a little differently than D&D, however; spells have cooldowns & require action pts to use, no memorizing & resting are required.  Voice acting, Sound-FX, music & graphics are nicely done.  Dialogue is well-written with plenty of wit and the storyline is shaping up nicely.  Haven't messed with the Divinity Engine Toolkit yet, but from what I've seen, if the community gets behind it, expect Skyrim-calibre moddability.  Multiplayer can be fun, but the game is a little slow-paced for two players (lot of reading in between combat) so maybe skip the co-op for your second play thru and try out a different class with your friends.\n\nGame crashed on me once so far, but the auto & quicksaves help there.","July 5, 2014","true","19.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/killerzelle/recommended/230230/","killerzelle","[Hosenpause] Killerzelle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/killerzelle/","73 products in account","Divinity Original Sin is old-school-style RPG, with a rich atmosphere, lots of character-building, turn-based combat and excellent coop-support where you (or you and a friend) play as the two main-characters, called the "source-hunters".\n\nTLDR-version: I definitly recommend this game to all non-casual RPG fans, for it highly depends on much reading and using ones own wits to solve or even find quests.\n\n[4/5] Gameplay\nThe gameplay as it is would be perfect. You have interesting combat (more on that later), trading and dialouge options with almost every character in the world, a gripping story and huge freedom in terms of character-building. Battle-mage that vanishes like a rouge during combat? No problem. The typical grumpy, know-it-all wizard with devasting spells? Of course. A weak charismatic healer with almost no combat skills? Here you go.\nThere regullary are dialouges between the two heros, where you can define their attitude towards each other and their nature.\nSo the observing reader may ask: Why only 4 out of 5 stars? Well the gameplay experience is hindered by some bugs from time to time (not that often). There is for example a bug, that lets the attributes and breastplate of your controlled hero disappear (only on your client). The host has to save the game and reload it to fix it. Or there is this bug that prevent you from hitting enemies that are to close to rocks or walls (only had this bug twice in my playtime).\nWith these bugs fixed the gameplay would be perfect.\n\n[5/5] Combat\nThe combat is round-based. Normally I prefer real-time combat over turn-based, but Divinity: Original Sin is an exception I guess. The combat is incredibly complex (yet easy, don't get me wrong!), so the turn-based system lets you use the terrain and fight very strategicaly. There are tons of different spells and lots of different weapon styles. You can (with the right talent) backstab enemies for extra damage or create a oil surface and inflame that, teleport an enemy into that burning surface, electrify water sufaces or steam-clouds, the possiblities are endless.\n\n[4.5/5] Controls\nNot much to say about the controlls. One could say good controlls don't come to your attention and that's the case here.\nThe game is mainly controlled with the mouse, though there are shortcuts for the spells in your hotbar, the inventory...\nThe only problem that occured to me is that when you try to get some item out of an poisoned/burning/electrified area and you can't reach it from out of that area, your hero steps into it and (especially in the begining of your journey) dies. So you have to be careful...\n\n[3.5/5] AI\nThe AI in this game controlls your character when you are walking by clicking on the ground instead of holding the left mouse button to guide him or her. It does a decent job at that, avoiding hazardous areas or traps, as long as it is able to (see "controlls").\nThe AI of enemies on the other hand somtimes is quite dumb. For example: It attacked my main character until he had 20hp left. Now it could have killed him with another successful hit. Instead it started attacking my companions and ended up losing that fight.\nSometimes I'm quite thankful for quirks like that, for the fights can be really hard from time to time, yet it feels "wrong", if you know what i mean.\nOften the AI beautifully combines spells and terrain effects, creating challenging fights without feeling unfair. Many times there was that "WTF?!" effect when an enemy shot an poison arrow at my group and in the next turn a mage set it on fire, nearly wiping the party.\n\n[5/5] Immersion\nWhat can I say about this one, except it is perfect? The dialouges are interesting and you can have them with literally every person on the map (except the mobs of course...). A certain talent allows you to speak with animals, which often have an intersting story to tell, a funny sentence (Imagine a rooster saying: "Soon the cleaver of decapitation will be turned upon you, the revolution is coming!!"), or even tips on how to solve puzzles.\n\n\n[5/5] Map\nAll of the levels are beautiful designed and contain many details. There are hidden secrets and treasure, quests off the beaten path. Could you ask for more?\n\n[4.5/5] Graphics\nThe graphics are held in a isometric view and rotatable by some 90°, but you can zoom in really close and look your hero into the eyes (while having a cool blurred background). The game nicely plays with different ambient lighting and weather effects. The spell effects are solid, not always brilliant, but definitly nice.\nSome of the animations are kind of clunky, yet they do not destroy the atmosphere or immersion.\n\n[4/5] Audio\nThe game has a amazing soundtrack, that beautifully accompanies combat, travel or dialgoues. All the other audio is solid, but sometimes repetitive.\nTake for example the marketplace of the first city, where you will spend very much time. All of the merchants have a few lines they say, some funny, some serious. But they repeat that few lines over and over again.\nAfter hearing "No one has as many friends, as the man with the many cheeses!" for the 40th time you have an urge to slaughter that man, believe me.\nOnly a few of the dialouges are spoken, but considering the vast amount of dialouges I guess it's ok.\nYet, everything that is spoken is done very well.\n\n[NA/5] Developers\nI had no contact with the developers.\n\nThough it has some flaws this game is definitly worth buying. It is highly addictive, especially in coop.\nDivinity: Original Sin is one of my favourite games of all time.\n\nFinal Rating 4.5 out of 5 stars - Fix the bugs and some of the minor flaws and this game is perfection.","August 3, 2014","true","25.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Larian have done a terrific job bringing old school RPG into 2014 without compromising or dumbing it down. Pretty much everything you know and love about cRPG is there. Complex character stats, inventory management, wall of texts and no quest marker.\nCombat is all turned based, using the action point system. What makes it interesting is the area effect and how the different element interact with each other. Cast a spell to make it rain and enemies become more susceptible to stuns (electricity) or frozen. Drop poison gas or oil and follow it up with a fireball and the gas/oil blows up causing more damage to the affected area. It's going to suck now playing other RPGs and not being able to remove or use hazards to your advantage.\nGame was made to be played co-op but if you want to just play it single-player (I did), it'll pretty much play just like any other RPG except you'll have an option to roleplay both characters. A recent patch added personalilties that you can set on your 2 main characters which will let the AI control the other main character you aren't controling in conversation should you want to automate either character's responses.\nThe story is probably the only real weakness of the game. It's pretty generic fantasy stuff (with a humorous undertone, especially on side quests), but it did keep me engaged enough for the 85 or so hours it took me to finish the game with all side quests done (great btw). The puzzles are, in most cases done pretty well. Some of them might not be obvious right away. You'll have to look around your environment, reading books or talking to the right person for clues. There was 1 or 2 that was convoluted, which lead to trial and error.\nThe game isn't perfect but I did not run into any game breaking bugs and Larian is constantly updating the game on a regular basis. There's a free toolset that comes with the game so hopefully, we'll be seeing quality user generated content that will keep the game alive for hours after finishing the campaign. We've got 3 more cRPGs coming out (Wasteland 2, Torment and Pillars of Eternity), Larian was the first out of the gate and it has set a pretty high bar for the rest to follow.\n","July 17, 2014","true","90.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Let's say that there's a fire in your way. Casting rain will put out the fire, leaving behind a steam cloud that blocks line of sight and a bunch of puddles. Casting lightning on the puddles will then cause them to be electrified, stunning anyone who walks over them. There are all sorts of elemental interactions like this can make for fairly deep and nuanced combat.\n\nThe story is fairly compelling, with a well realized world and interesting intrigue between different players. I played through this game 100% coop and think that it deserves to be lauded for making a deep RPG with an interesting story that actively encourages people to work together. I feel that that's the next step for gaming. We've had plenty of Left 4 Dead-ish action co op games, but now I feel that story-oriented coop can become a real thing.\n\nBut unfortunately, the game needs some simple UI adjustments to become a bit more coop friendly. If you have two different people doing two different things in a game, then you need to clearly deliver all plot essential dialogue to both players. Often I'd be off crafting something and my partner would go and have an important conversation and I'd be left wondering what the heck was going on. Considering that the game gives you a teleport pyramid thing early on, it really wouldn't have hurt to pull the other player to important dialogues the moment they started (and to pop a dialogue window for both players the moment said dialogue began).\n\nAnother problem is that the game's puzzles are completely awful. Any puzzle where you have to run around a room looking for a button to press (which usually is impossible to see with the default camera angle) is not really a puzzle at all. Portal 2 taught us that group puzzle solving can be incredibly fun and there are moments when I got that same high of being able to figure out a solution and brag about it, but those moments were heavily outweighed by the pixel hunt puzzles.\n\nWith a little more polish in these departments, this would have been a superb game. As it stands right now, I'd call it a pretty good game (maybe even a REALLY good game) that is certainly moving in the right direction.\n\nIf they make an expansion pack, I'll certainly get it.","September 2, 2014","true","89.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Divinity is an absolute blast of an RPG that gets just about everything perfectly right.\n\nYou are able to tailor each one of your characters into a specific role, and the possibilities are highly varied. Templates are offered to help get you started if you like. Anything from front-line tank, to mobile assassin, to a wizard that manipulates and shuts down the environment and uses his pets for the wetwork, to a support character that crafts the party wicked new equipment, or who enhances the treasures they already own, but there's no reason you can't treat it as a buffet and pick up a little bit of everything. Customization goes beyond the normal STR/DEX/INT stats into independent skills you can level up, abilities you can learn, and (most fun of all) fallout-style perks. Character customization doesn't stop there. There are multiple opportunities to engage in dialog with other NPCs, or even your friend/party if you are playing co-op. Your answers here define your personality traits. Reflect carefully upon them, for you are called upon in certain situations to roleplay your character consistently with previous choices!\n\nCombat is highly tactical and turn based. I started out as an air wizard, but later found that pincushioning baddies in the back was a lot more fun for me. Those magic points weren't wasted, as they translated into excellent crowd control abilities. Charm one monster, teleport another away, then stab a third in the back. Wonderful. The power player is amply rewarded, while still allowing you the freedom to make some happy mistakes in customizing your character. Especially in the first quarter of the game, there were a few fights that we bullheadedly jumped into despite being far out of our EXP league, but we would boobytrap the entire environment, move tables and chairs around to create killing zones, and set up devastating openers and were able to squeak by. In the last quarter of the game, our min/maxed characters were so overwhelming that if we were able to get enough of an opening and get all our buffs & debuffs in line, there were very few monsters (boss or otherwise) that we couldn't take out in a single volley. This was our reward for playing so aggressively. That is not to say that combat ever became trivial or tedious, despite being a combat oriented RPG, it is amazing how memorable each and every fight was. There was always some situation that was slightly new, that required us to think a little bit differently. I don't know how they pulled it off, but the results are amazing.\n\nI had hesitations playing an RPG game as CO-OP, but those reservations were muted almost immediately. Our very first encounter in the game resulted in us having a disagreement about how to proceed. We resolved that dispute using a mini-game, but each of our characters choices was still reflected in our personality matrix that was being built, so no one feels like they're being bulldozed or wasting their time. “Your objection has been noted in the logs”. Having a friend who specializes and is familiar with their specific character during combat is also a relief - everyone knows their job and how to perform it best.\n\nThe perfection of Divinity is what leads its rough patches to stand out in even starker detail. Keeping the storyline straight in single player might be hard enough, but in co-op at points it became very difficult.  There is a chat log that records all conversations, yours or otherwise, so this is more of a user interface issue. The writing is good, but not as good as, well, Planescape (That is perhaps unfair). Also some of the "puzzle dungeons" are more obnoxious than they needed to be. Characters don’t really seem to respond differently based on your personality matrix or reputation. Finally, in a single player game, if one of your characters maximizes a skill, say loremaster, then it's something that easily applies to your 3 companions. But in co-op, you have to keep asking your buddy to identify some equipment for you, or remind you what a monster's HP or immunities/weaknesses are. Stuff like that should probably just apply to the entire party with the value being the max of whomever is the highest. There are also a few quest glitches.  Larian seems to be releasing patches often and regularly, so maybe these issues will be buffed out by the time you play. And if you like RPGs, then let's assume that whether you will play this or not is a foregone answer.\n\nFinal rating: 4.5/5 stars","September 3, 2014","true","76.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The writing is excellent--often hilarious--and the setting manages to avoid being generic. The combat system plays well and as a spellcaster, let me just say: the spellcasting system is really, really cool. Through spells as well as physical interaction you can alter your environment and make use of it. There's the old D&D trick of using grease + fire, of course, but you can also do things like create steam or rainstorms, etc.\n\nThere's one pretty irritating bug with a workaround. You can't see most of the conversations your partner has except for a brief floating text over their head. If you open up the journal (L) and go to Dialogues, though, you're able to see the conversation as it happens. Not terrible but I hope they fix it.","July 5, 2014","true","43.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And speaking of it, the game world is enormous and should provide from 60 to 100 hours of fun, even without considering any of the user generated content that fans will provide on the Steam Workshop.\n\nThe levelling system is classless so you can literally become anything you like (although the game delivers tens of starting archetypes if you don't want to mess too much with all the traits and abilities): for example, you can start as a warrior and acquire magical skills later in the game as you level up and assign points accordingly.\n\nCombat is tactical and turn-based and therefore quite complex... but don't worry, it's fun and you can plan your next move without being in a hurry!\n\nThe post-launch lack of "AI personalities" for your party members has been fixed, and therefore now in singleplayer you can enjoy dialogues and banter with your own party members without having to pick all lines for everybody. :P\n\nOverall I'm very impressed with this game, and I am looking forward to play it for much time to come. If you like CRPGs like me... get it, you won't be disappointed.\n\nMy vote: 9 / 10","June 30, 2014","true","18.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Aces across the board.\n\nThe graphics are nice and the environment is both beautiful as well as interactive, as during combat you can add water, fire, smoke, steam, and other effects to change the tide of battle.  These effect sight lines and cause damage.\n\nThe combat is turn-based and full of great magical spells.  I also enjoy having to balance healing with aggression.\n\nThere are 12 classes, but each is very customizable. There are many unique abilities, skills, attributes, and crafts for you to play around with.\n\nThis is an old-school RPG game, so expect 15 hours of walking and talking to citizens before you hit level 4 -- at which point you will have enough skill and companions to survive a fight.  Also, you can kite enemies back to the guards or into areas full of traps to gain advantages.\n\nThere are TONS of items in the game, but most you'll never use and most you'll sell.  There seems to be a finite amount of gold in this world, and I've collected what feels like most of it.  Second reroll = 18hrs = 23K.

Larian have done a terrific job bringing old school RPG into 2014 without compromising or dumbing it down. Pretty much everything you know and love about cRPG is there. Complex character stats, inventory management, wall of texts and no quest marker.\nCombat is all turned based, using the action point system. What makes it interesting is the area effect and how the different element interact with each other. Cast a spell to make it rain and enemies become more susceptible to stuns (electricity) or frozen. Drop poison gas or oil and follow it up with a fireball and the gas/oil blows up causing more damage to the affected area. It's going to suck now playing other RPGs and not being able to remove or use hazards to your advantage.\nGame was made to be played co-op but if you want to just play it single-player (I did), it'll pretty much play just like any other RPG except you'll have an option to roleplay both characters. A recent patch added personalilties that you can set on your 2 main characters which will let the AI control the other main character you aren't controling in conversation should you want to automate either character's responses.\nThe story is probably the only real weakness of the game. It's pretty generic fantasy stuff (with a humorous undertone, especially on side quests), but it did keep me engaged enough for the 85 or so hours it took me to finish the game with all side quests done (great btw). The puzzles are, in most cases done pretty well. Some of them might not be obvious right away. You'll have to look around your environment, reading books or talking to the right person for clues. There was 1 or 2 that was convoluted, which lead to trial and error.\nThe game isn't perfect but I did not run into any game breaking bugs and Larian is constantly updating the game on a regular basis. There's a free toolset that comes with the game so hopefully, we'll be seeing quality user generated content that will keep the game alive for hours after finishing the campaign. We've got 3 more cRPGs coming out (Wasteland 2, Torment and Pillars of Eternity), Larian was the first out of the gate and it has set a pretty high bar for the rest to follow.\n","July 17, 2014","true","90.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970771190/recommended/230230/","76561197970771190","*****","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970771190/","160 products in account","Introduction\nDivinity: Original Sin (commonly referred to as D:OS) follows the same style of play as the original Divinity Series, and also to, Divinity Eco Draconis or the Dragon Knight Saga.  D:OS is a role playing game that follows the rules of Dungeons and Dragons probably better than other games of a similar genre - wherein this game features turn based combat.  Explore freely, get attacked, and rather than being completely unprepared for it, you have the time to formulate your strategy\n\nThe Good\nThere are very many fun aspects of the game, but the biggest "success" is the fact that you're given the freedom to be who you want to be.  If you want to be the most unsympathetic swine in the world - you can.  Want to kill random strangers?  Go right ahead!  Of course, you'll be hunted down for doing so, but at least the game gives you the choice to do it.\n\nThe term "LOL" will apply many times when playing this game - of course assuming you have a funny bone.  I'm sure my neighbours heard me the first time I used the sneak ability.  The main story line is "serious", but I'd say a great many of the side quests have some kind of funny anecdote here and there.  These occasional lapses into ludicrity make the game really enjoyable to play.  You may even find yourself drawn into the game emotionally, feeling really sorry for the plight of the people that you are helping.\n\nThe Bad\nHaving played this game from it's release date, I've found that I've fell into a lot of pitfalls of this game, and I've had to play it 3 times through before being able to complete it.  I'm an achievement fanatic, and unless you play this game in a very specific way, you won't get 100% achievements, because some options just wont' be available.  To me, this is not a good thing, because it reduces some of my freedom.\n\nAnother bad aspect of the game is the lack of quest markers - in fact, quest markers are, to my memory, used only twice within the game.  This is just simply not enough, considering the amount of times I've had to fumble about with the map to try to figure out where I'm supposed to go.\n\nI've spent more time Googling in this game than in any game I've ever played - because a lot of the quest objectives, or maps aren't obvious enough.  The dungeon tutorial also doesn't provide enough tutorial for you to really get to know the game well enough - like for example not telling you that you have the ability to heal yourself or any party member by lying on a bed and resting.\n\nConclusion\nThanks to the concerted efforts of the developers to provide bugfixes so quickly after the game was released, I can happily say now that this game will now bring you a lot of hours of enjoyment, with a few hours of frustration.  The good news is that you don't have to stay frustrated for long - just use Google and then you'll find the clues that were nowhere else to be seen.  This game will annoy you - but as long as you persevere, you wil find that the overall experience will be more rewarding.\n\nPrepare yourself for many hours of fun.","July 27, 2014","true","98.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Music, graphics, gameplay, voice acting (even the annoying archeologist). Even though the combat is turn based its action is mezmorizing. The way they have woven many NPC's fate together keep you guessing whats next or who done it. Anyone loving Baldurs Gate or Icewind Dale style games will love this. Its hard to put down. I don't know what it is but I just love the fact that you always have a key to the door or chest, whether in the form of a key, lockpick or brute strength, my favorite having Madora smash something into oblivion. The "effects" that npc's are put under add depth to combat, a group of Orcs standing in a puddle causing them to be "wet" now you get to zap them with electricity for extra damage/stunning but be careful. If you are within that same puddle you feel the effects too.
