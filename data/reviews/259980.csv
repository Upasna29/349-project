"http://steamcommunity.com/id/charkie/recommended/259980/","charkie","Charkie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/charkie/","1425 products in account","The biggest departure of the series within the collection of You Don't Know Jack games on Steam. You Don't Know Jack 4: The Ride is locked in at 13 questions per game, with themed episodes that you choose based on your answer to a hypothetical question before each game. You don't pick your questions, either. Instead, you pick how much each question will be worth, although it's mostly random. It's a much darker and grittier game (literally), with times where it will actively try to mess with you (like disabling all vowels on your keyboard when entering your name), and with a light plot that has multiple endings to chose from. This is definitely the most bizarre game in the YDKJ series, but I think it might actually be my favorite.","November 10, 2013","true","3.1"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

It includes the best hosts of the series: Cookie Masterson, Guy Towers, Josh "Schmitty" Schmitstinstein, and Nate Shapiro. (Buzz Lippman is also there, but that would be going into spoilers. Yes, spoilers for a TRIVIA game.)\n\nThe classic question types of Gibberish, DisOrDat, and the Jack Attack are back, and feel fresh. The question types for solely this game, Roadkill and Jack Bingo, also add a fresh feeling to the experience.\n\nThe Ride was frankly the shot in the arm the YDKJ series needed back in 1998, since volumes up to this one felt largely the same for the most part. Not that that was a bad thing.\n\nIf you love trivia games or game shows, you're doing a disservice to yourself by not getting this game, or the other YDKJs. But this one is the best.\n\nScore: 7/7: F*cking Awesome!","December 14, 2013","true","15.7"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","12","12","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kowaiyume/recommended/259980/","kowaiyume","夢３","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kowaiyume/","46 products in account","By far one of the best Jack games to date. Yeah, some of the questions are a bit dated (hey, it was made in 1998), but it still fun to play. The classic questions types are back like "Dis or Dat" and (to the hosts' dismay) "Ticklish Testgum" (Gibberish Questions) along with new ones like "Roadkill" and "Jack BINGO". "Roadkill" is simular to the Jack Attack, but you have to connect two items together instead of finding an item's match. "BINGO" has you buzz in when the correct letter of the answer is lit up, simular to Three Way from YDKJ 3. It does add a lot of variety to the game. This game features all the host from previous Jack games and has a small story arc (you'll know what it is by the second time you play). Don't worry, it's still the same game with the randomness and twisted trivia you know and love. Also, screws has been changed and for the better in my opinion. Instead of pressing S once to screw somebody, you have to hit S multiple times to make the question totally unreadable and force your opponents to answer the question, whether it's readable or not. One small thing I want to point out is the music. The electric guitar can really get you pumped to play. Special mentions goes to both versions of the Jack Attack music, by far the most tense music out of all Jack games. The one downside is that this game is very US-centric. So if you do not live in the United States, the jokes and refrences can fly right over your head. This poses a problem since most of the jokes are built into the questions. All in all, if your looking for a fun party game to play with your friends (or alone for all you hermets out there) then this game is a must buy.","June 26, 2014","true","26.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

However, for me it is not the case. I live in Russia and English is my second language, however, I can totally enjoy that game at almost fullest still when I get friends to play it with me (given their English knowledge is just as good) This game is not so emphatic on celebrities unlike the more relevant ones so it makes this perfect for me. Mostly, the trivia in this is all about general knowledge and something that is already history and not a thing anymore e.g Clinton being presedent. (Can see the recuring theme of developers that can't get over the Cold War)\nGame here is devided into episodes under one topic. Topics can vary from Parenting to Fetishes.

I even watched the short-lived TV gameshow.  But out of all of them, and any other trivia game I've played, this is my absolute favorite.\nThe way it announces the topic of the episode is humorous, the questions themselves hilarious.  And so much attention to the details of every little thing.\nFor example: I've seen several times where I picked a wrong answer on one question, and later on in the episode the announcer would make reference to that previous answer.  The programming they've put in for such tiny details makes the game feel like it's learning as you are, finding out the absolute best way to mock and ridicule you.\n\nThe only downside I have to the game is that it is only local-co-op for multiplayer.  Where both players have to huddle beside each other and share the keyboard.  But given it was released in '98, the fact it doesn't have online multiplayer is easily overlooked.\n\nIf you like random trivia, and want to be entertained to the point of having to pause the game because you're laughing too loud to hear the announcer, then buy this game.","January 4, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
