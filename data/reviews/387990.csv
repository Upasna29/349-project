Scrap Mechanic is a 3d sandbox where you can construct all kinds of things. From spider mechs to transforming houses, the things you can make are surprisingly vast considering how early in development this game is. The best part? They are planning to add plenty more, which will open up your options to even greater extents.\n\nPositives:\nThis game has a pleasing aesthetic.\nThere's no limit to how complex/big your creation can be.\nYou can set up your vehicle to have multiple passengers, or "co-pilots"(Useful for aircrafts and mechs).\nYou can automate things. (Spinning windmill, elevators, etc)\nThe game actually has pretty good physics for the most part.\nDecent variety of materials to use.\nQuick load times.\nDrop in/drop out multiplayer works flawlessly.\nYou can make games within this game! Like what me and my friend did in this video.\nThis game doesn't take a lot to run, has pretty low minimum requirements for a 2016 game.\nA survival mode is planned for the game.\nDevs seem to be fairly active on the forums\nThere's 2 maps, one with terrain and one flat-world for those who just want to build.\nYou can create, (auto)save, and load back into multiple worlds.\nThere are in-game tutorials to help you out; they are well designed and easy to understand.\nNegatives:\nThe game can lag pretty bad, even on high end PC's(especially in multiplayer)\nThe maps are kinda small, but plenty big enough to have fun in.\nThe game will crash from time to time. Fixed for the most part.\nSometimes you'll run into weird bugs while building more complicated things.\nIntense rubberbanding can occur after long playtimes on multiplayer\nWhen in a semi-fast vehicle, your character twists and warps backwards because it can't keep up with the speed.\nThe triggers (buttons, sensors, switches) only work one way. (i.e. You can't hook up two switches to a single door for inside/outside)\nOther people can build on/destroy your stuff\nDevs don't seem to have a roadmap Devblogs are being released with this info.\nAt this time, there's no real "point" to making things. Those looking for "objectives" will want to wait.\nSo is it worth it?\nAbsolutely. This game is extremely fun for what it currently is. You'll find yourself figuring out how to make your vehicle faster, or how to climb hills better, to not flip over, and so on. Before you know it, you'll have spent 3 hours improving it to perfection. Then you'll find yourself thinking of new ideas you'll want to try, even while not playing the game. I can easily recommend this game to anyone who enjoys creative sandboxes like Minecraft or Garry's Mod. Although this game has a fair amount of negatives, they do not make the game unplayable by any means, and they certainly don't outweigh the positives. If you can, you should pick this game up for sure.\n\n(Did you like this review? If so, please vote it up!

You also notice tiny differences between toasts and their preparation\nYou finally enjoy a proper toast, but the more you eat, the hungrier you get\nYour hunger for toasts gets bigger and bigger with every known recipe\nYou start modifying your snacks and try challenges from other toast fans\nYou achieve toasting heaven, nothing can stop you now, you have mastered the art of toast.

And if you're like me then this game will not dissapoint. As I'm writing this review the game is still in early development but still has lots of interesting 'mechanics' that allows the player to run wild with their imagination!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NB4RQ/recommended/387990/","NB4RQ","NB4RQ™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NB4RQ/","129 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI don't write many game reviews, but I felt it was necessary to write one for Scrap Mechanic. So here's the basic rundown of the game in my mind and in this review I will be listing items that I think should be addressed.\n\nMy Experience So Far So far on this game at the time of writing this review I have almost 16.5 hours played. As far as Early Access games go, this one is by far the most advanced from Launch Date that i've ever\nseen on Steam, from Launch it had more than enough to keep you busy for hours on end right out of the gates, not very many games can say that. I started off watching the Videos on the game's\npage like the Introducing ones that showcased the Controller, Thruster etc etc, then as I experimented and numerous trial and error situations, I started getting better and better at knowing\nwhat was going on and how things click. I started with a little piddly concrete car with a horendous design, but then I started to get more intricate with my designs, using pipes and I-Beams\nto make an overall badass design, then I found out the steering mechanics and how to work the controller with ease, once all this clicked I made some of my best creations.\n\nMultiplayer As fun as this game is when you're alone, I thought to myself, "Wow, this would be so fun if I had some buds to play this game with." Sure enough this game was already equipped with a\nMultiplayer from Launch! At first that seems amazing, but then once you start getting a total of 4 players and even sometimes 2 players, the servers lag tremendously, my friends and I\nboth checked and we came to the conclusion that it was in fact server side lag, now I know the game came out almost a week ago, but I think that Dedicated Servers should be a rather large\npriority for a game of this proportion. Overall, the Multiplayer in this game is rather flawless when I doesn't lag, it makes for an amazing experience with friends and it has so much potential\nlike the rest of this game. My rating for the Multiplayer alone is a solid:\n\n8/10- This rating due to the Server Side Lag, which can be fixed in the future, otherwise, its spotless.\n\n\nPriorities  Now let's talk priorities in this game and let's face it there are a decent amount, so I will just list them:\nIn-Game Name Tags\nDedicated Servers\nSteam Workshop Support\nAerodynamics\nFriction Between Wheels and Other Blocks\nRemote Control\nForce Save Feature\nBigger Worlds\nMore World Options\nVariety in Blocks\nMore Offered Angles when Building (Like 15,30,45 etc etc)\n\nThe list could go on and I know some of things I listed will come in future updates, but I thought I would get it out there.\n\nMy Message to the Devs\nDear Axolot Games,\nThere are many games out there, Early Access games that get promises that 99% of the time aren't actually given, be in the 1% that actually cares about\ntheir community and whatever you do, never and I mean NEVER give up on this game and "Scrap" it...see what I did there? Anyways, do not be like previous games\nthat were promised to be huge and have a lot of potential just to die off. For everyone that loves this game and wants it to be as huge as we project it to be, don't give\nup on us, we've been lied to before and we can't take too many heartbreaks. We the Mechanics of this game can see the future, we see large worlds, hundreds of different blocks\nand pieces we can put on our contraptions, Workshop support so we can share our insane inventions and vehicles with the rest of the community and so much more. With that note, we all thank\nyou for making this game that we will hopefully loves for days, months and possibly years to come.\n\nFinal Rating  My overall rating for Scrap Mechanic Lands at:\n\n8.5/10- Due to the Multiplayer Server Issue, other than that, Great Game!\n\nIf you agree with this rating or just like the review, please upvote it so others can see and maybe even the Devs so they can get a basic understanding of what the community wants.\n","January 26","true","24.0"," 131 of 143 people (92%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","92","131","143","12","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/recommended/387990/","EdenStarGazer","EdenStarGazer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/","429 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nScrap Mechanic is a sand box/ open world builder game that allows you to be an engineer or an architect, with your own transforming buildings and vehicles that you can fly and drive.If you like experimenting with mechanical design, and making things go from just spare parts, then Scrap Mechanic is sure to hook you instantly. But, if you are mechanically challenged don’t worry. The Devs at Axolot Games have put together a fun assortment of “smart” parts that are pre-wired to have your designs rolling, spinning, sliding, or flying in one direction or another… or every direction at once. It also provides a user handbook in your hotbar, complete with video how-to links. The building mechanics are simple and allow you to build walls and parts to scale with ease. But, expect a learning curve and a lot of laughs as you find yourself hanging upside down from trees.\n\nGraphics/ Music:\nThe art is incredibly well done. The landscape is covered with a realistic style of comic book trees, rocks, and farm equipment. Music is not only upbeat, but a radio is provided and can be attached to creations on the go. But, there is no water anywhere. This would be a feature that would be highly desired, as it would allow for design of boats. In the current early access state, the graphics run a bit slow. The lag is real… especially on low-end machines. This is a factor that needs more work, and from what the devs are saying in the forum and frequent dev blogs, it is a priority. They’ve doubled their team size this month, and while they are still adding new features constantly, they are also busy improving existing features in the program.  I’ve noticed the game runs faster on my pc already in just the couple of weeks I’ve been playing. Other early access games I’ve played started out with similar lag, but were soon running with ease for me.\n\nNarrative:\nThe survival mode story has you playing the role of a robot maintenance mechanic in space. You crash land on your first assignment on an agricultural planet where you are supposed to keep the ag-bots in working order. But, you find the place deserted and a couple of old vehicles that you can commandeer as is, or salvage for scrap parts for your own creations. This should provide more options for those players like me who have a hard time getting started with their first build.\n\nHowever, the current build has you playing in creative mode only. You can choose the terrain map, which has rolling hills and steep valleys. This seems designed much like the Disney Cars playset in Disney Infinity 1.0, (sorry, but Steam isn’t the only platform out there) very fun, lots of room to drive and do stunts, and a variety of land features. Or you can choose a flat world with nothing but dirt, for experimenting with designs or hosting mp competitions.\n\nCombat:\nThere seems to be no combat in the game at all at the moment. I haven’t found any indication of plans in this area either. The character takes no fall damage, and is not affected by hunger. Sunshine and noon are static for the time being. I assume the pending “survival mode” will include dynamic weather, and a day/night cycle, as well as other needs.  I also hope vehicular combat will be an option.\n\nMultiplayer:\nYou are able to invite friends into your game with ease. This seems to be functioning well. I also discovered that you can go into the flat sandbox, set limits on the number of parts each player is allowed to use on their vehicle, and host a design competition with friends. This provides infinite options for hours of mp fun, as well as the ability to design your own world and even race tracks.\n\nPros:\n•	Creative, fun, and highly playable as is\n•	Wide array of simple usable parts to build almost anything you can imagine\n•	Flight, Mechanics, & Construction\n•	Encourages trial & error\n•	Suitable for all ages (even adult engineer types)\n•	High replay value\n\nCons:\n•	Lag\n•	No water, and limited map size in early access\n•	No day/night cycle yet, creative mode only in current build\n•	No combat yet\n\nScrap Mechanic is one of those games that I love to recommend, because it has everything to offer. It is family friendly, creative, and fun all at the same time. It is definitely an upper tier game and worth the price, because it has tremendous replay-ability. I rate it an 8 out of 10 in the sandbox/ open world builder genre, but will probably change that rating after the final release.","April 12","true","50.9"," 65 of 73 people (89%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","89","65","73","10","0"

It doesn't require a beefy computer but it's still very big and the game itself is under 1 GB. It's just amazing. At first I thought it'd be one of those typical building games but then I realised there's more to it than that. As I continued playing I noticed that you can build anything, absolutely anything, the game is only in ALPHA which really surprised me the most! I rate this game a solid 5/7 and if you don't know what that means, well, it means 10/10. I would totally recommend this game to anyone that likes playing with their friends and that enjoy building/engineering games or just anyone really.","January 20","true","2.9"," 79 of 104 people (76%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","76","79","104","42","0"

With that being said I really had tons of fun playing this game. (Link in the description of gameplay and review) Right now there is only creative mode with a terrain map or a flatworld and with having limited blocks/items in the game I can’t say Scrap Mechanic is worth its $20usd price tag, unless you are willing to bet it will become something great with the addition of features and updates. There is not much more to say about this game, but I can’t wait to see what the devs have instore for updates and future content.

Now after recording and editing my first video of this game, it's already got about 50 postive reviews, only a few hours after launching!  For a game I'd never heard of before tonight, I'd say that's pretty impressive!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW8lq6GH18E\n\nThis game is super fluid and makes getting online and making some awesome machines really easy, yet with believable and realistic physics and mechanical functionality.  That means that not only is creativity rewarded with a game like this, but it will also reward well planned and constructed designs and attention to detail.  I love games like this.\n\nIf you ever played Besiege and wanted a game like that which also allowed you to play with your friends online in an open and free world, you'd found your dream I think!  Scrap Mechanic is going to make a lot of creative minds really, really happy and reward them with a great world and tools for building some truly amazing machines that only imaginations can think up.\n\nSuper friendly user interface, great instructions and tutorial is available but not required before jumping in and getting your hands dirty!  Love it, love it, love it!  ..And this is launch day in early access... just imagine what all else this game might deliver to gamers before it's all finished and complete!  ...Wow!\n\nIf you love legos, especially the Technics Legos... if you love the Besiege game... if you love open crafting worlds that allow your imagination to soar and also allow you to connect online with your friends.. this game is already a MUST-BUY in my opinion!\n\nA++, fantastic job to the developers behind this amazing new early access game.  This is exacty why so many people buy early access games, and this is what more developers should try and strive for before releasing their new games into early access.","January 20","true","4.5"," 54 of 78 people (69%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","69","54","78","11","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mikeweem/recommended/387990/","mikeweem","mikeweem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mikeweem/","273 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n[Game provided by Developer]\n\nThe Value of Potential -or- A Quick Disclaimer\nMy imagination runs wild... seriously, I should have a harness for it. Sometimes it would be nice to have the ability, with a quick snap of the wrist, to yank it right back into reality. The understanding that I have a tendency to dream bigger than the possibilities (or even intended scope) of a game is a good thing... but there is a responsibility to others that goes beyond the value of simply understanding one aspect of who I am.\n\nPlease, do not purchase any game based on mine (or anyone else's) excitement for a game's potential, which is often the only kind of feedback you get from most of us. Understand there are many variables at play including disposable income, personal preferences, things that can change down the road (or things that don't change), and more. I suggest asking yourself... would you be okay spending the money if you only played it for an hour or less? If not, I recommend learning more about the game (any game) before making a decision.\n\nOk, sorry about the detour there, but with that said...\n\nI'm Enjoying It\nWhat's here I'm enjoying. I found myself at work today excited to get home and play it some more. In my first video for the game, I essentially introduce it to my viewers and explain what I am excited about. Since then, I have learned how to really use the Controller and am even more excited about the possibilities.\n\nI've found myself thinking of so many things I want to do that I have begun to write them out. It's amazing to see the videos of what people are doing, but it really is something else when you have an idea and you make it happen. Watching all of the moving parts snap to position smoothly (after experimenting for a while)... it's great! I find myself clicking the buttons again and again... lemme see it one more time!\n\nIt's Accessible\nScrap Mechanic has found a way to present to you mechanisms that allow for great depths of creativity while simultaneously finding a way to present it to you in a way that is very approachable - easy to grasp. You may not be aware immediately of just how deep you might take it, but getting those basics down is really quite easy. It's an accomplishment that, I hope (and assume) speaks to the core of the goals of the development team. These are the kinds of things that help me imagine the game could have a very bright future. Accessibility is key.\n\nMy Only "Concern" is What Is Not Here (Yet)\nThere is no survival mode yet. Watch some of the developer videos, or read the description of the game and you know it is coming in some form, but from what I have gathered (and I could have missed something somewhere) all we know is that our "farmbots" have gone crazy and our only hope for survival is to use our "quick thinking", "creativity" and our "knack of turning your surroundings to your advantage". I have not seen anything about elements such as hunger, thirst, environmental hazards, or anything else.\n\nSurvival mode is not only required, but it must also have some teeth in order to keep my interest for months and potentially years to come. Based on what I have seen so far, I have every hope and expectation that they CAN deliver on this (and I am SO very excited to see it in action!), but without much more information beyond the feature listing (that I have seen), it's simply a HOPE of mine that it will be every bit as exciting and enjoyable as the other side of the game has been.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIn it's current form, Scrap Mechanic has been a blast during my limited play (8 hours or so at this point) and I certainly will enjoy it beyond today. The survival mode is what I am really REALLY excited about, but without much information on it yet, I can only dream of the possibilities and hope that the team can bring it to reality in a way that we all enjoy.\n\nThe potential here is truly amazing, and while I am indeed "recommending" this game, please remember that this is Early Access. Some things change, and some things don't - in either cases, these can be for better or for worse. They clearly say as much about the game in it's current state as well, so please keep it in mind.\n\nThanks for reading (if you made it this far)! ;)\n\n~ Weem\n\nBy the way - you know, while I am here  - here's a link to my latest Scrap Mechanic video, for those interested!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/G3nUiVODPU8","January 20","true","26.9"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","28","34","2","0"

A car, boat, helicopter, automatic stairs, automated farms you name it.\nScrap Machanic is seriously scratching that itch for me. I start messing around with a simple idea and before long I've got 9 machines round me that all look different, none of them work and half are just jumping up and down against a tree. Then eventually one will shiny through, a brief moment of function springs to life. It all seems so simple at this stage but theres that instant moment of triumph. I find it never lasts though, it's not enough. Now I can build that I can biuld it bigger and better and now I'll work in this other feature. Its a neverending cycle for me. A sliding door one day and transforming pot plant the next.\nLoving this game and probably will be for some time.\nRuns like a dream and everything looks so beautiful in motion.

I guess I should say they aren't traps, but I do often get caught by the "Look at these cool features" list and wanna play the game bad. I'm also a sucker for engineering and physics games, so this one similar to Space Engineers but simpler really caught my attention. Needless to say it needs work and many more additions to the game before it's worth the  buy. If you want to support the devs, by all means do so since these guys have a real gem on their hands.\n\nNow for the actual review.\n\nGraphics: For the style of the game, top notch graphics. Zero complaints and runs smooth as a butter.\n\nControls: Easily the best sandbox world controls I've ever player. Every button is where you think it should be. Not once did I ever think of switching a control. Definitely shows these devs are true gamers and know how hands work on a keyboard. More than I can say about most engineering game controls and simplicity.\n\nReplay Value: Once they have more object in, I'd say it has the replay value of Minecraft. Most games like this have 150-200 assets to be used in game, this one has like 25. So pretty much after you've used the small amount of blocks and decoration blocks you're left with your imagination. However, you are limited and a lot of the joy comes from that limitation and trying to find a way in game to work around what you want to do. For example, they have only one real tool that you program, the bearing. The Bearing only works in rotational movement, meaning if you want a linear straight line  for something like a sliding door, you would need to literally make a contraption of six or so moving parts and a bunch of basic logic programing to do so. This in no way takes away from the game as it allows you to explore what you have in front of you. Eventually things will be added to avoid these work arounds so people can play more efficiently without wasting 45 mins on a single sliding door.\n\nGameplay: This game feels fairly polished in terms of how everything works, surprising since this is an Early Access game. By polish I don't mean everything works, but everything feels like it works. UI makes sense and looks final, everything is textured, world objects like trees and grass are all animated and look great, terrain is great, movement, controls, animations, etc. Everything in the game at the moement feels very good for how early on it is.\n\nOverall: The game is solid. A definite buy, but only if you're really into building machines. It's not like Minecraft where your focus is on a main building, but more a machine. 10/10 times I made a house I somehow made it into a land vehicle or a flying fortress. I've seen people build rail guns out of wood and metal, gundams, vehicles that launch planes, etc. There is also no Survival or anything of the sort just yet, but there will be. For now all we can play in is Creative.\n\nOn a side note I would like to give a kind of prediction with this being one of the best survival games to date. I've come to this conclusion based on the materials in the game and how other games used similar styles of survival. There are things like air conditioning with a bunch of assets for ventilation and a duct system, food storage and other storage, ability to make your own defense, launch pads in the game (Potential Space), there's O2 storage for Oxygen. Basically it looks like it's going to turn the love child of Space Engineers and Minecraft with the creepy uncle Rust influencing it.\n\nI do recommend, but not yet to buy.","January 25","true","9.8"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","15","19","2","0"

It's like Besiege meets Minecraft.\nIt has a lot of potential. Only sad part is devs are ignoring technical questions and most customers. Stability has gone done drastically and back up and there hasn't been an update that added any gameplay features. Sure music heads and paint are fun, but they don't allow you to build anything that you couldn't before and they obviously gave those priority to sell more copies.\n\nSo while I really, really want this game to become better and better, I have no idea what this game will look like in 6 months. Especially since they are not sharing any info on what direction this game is taking. Only thing we know is there's something about harvest robots and it will get a Survival mode, but they don't tell us anything really. They also don't acknowledge most technical problems until they are fixed, despite dozens of reports.\n\nSo I have very mixed feelings about this. I will be playing this for 100's of hours to come in Creative mode, so for me it's worth the 20 euro's. But objectively speaking... Paying 20 euro's for a game without support, no interesting updates in the first 2 months while not knowing where this game is going?\n\nI love the game, but I kind of don't want to support how the developers are doing this, because I strongly dislike the turn the game industry is taking. But I still want you to buy it though, because I want this community to grow and it's the only game like this.

I have an idea of how to build a rudimentary "gyro" and will attempt the build next. This is the reason I keep coming back to this game.

Many will make comparisons to other games and while those games have their own strengths, in terms of just the foundation for physics-based building, this game surpasses them. Games like Garry's Mod, Space Engineers, and Besiege all have more "stuff", but they've also been around longer. The core of this game just gets everything right: the block building mechanic is intuitive, the physics are very well done, the art style looks fantastic, and it already has multiplayer out of the gate.\n\n-You like Gmod? This game has better physics and the bare bones beginnings of it's own version of Wiremod.\n-You like Space Engineers? This game has a more intuitive building mechanic and you're not limited to the scope of space exploration.\n-You like Besiege? This has multiplayer\n\nPlus, this game will have survival in the future on top of parts and features that will be added.\n\nBottom line, I'm loving this game and I think any sandbox builder out there owes it to themselves to get this.\n\nPROS\n+Physics\n+Not limited to just one thing - you can build vehicles and bases, sure, but so much more, as well.\n+Looks Great\n+Runs Great (for me and most, there are of course exceptions)\n+Already has multiplayer\n+Devs are eager to help and communicate (Twitter,mostly... they haven't setup a subforum structure on here quite yet)\n\nCONS\n-I'd like to see more parts/features, but that's me being greedy. Logic gates would be FANTASTIC\n-It's a shame we can't wire up specific keys to specific things (other than the number keys). The driver's seat always stears bearings with A and D, but I'd rather be able to wire any output to any input, such as a thruster to any WASD key.\n-I'd like to see a server browser instead of the current invite system\n-Certain things need more customization, such as certain instances I'd like to have more speed using controllers.\n-SOME users have had issues with the game, but they can usually get them fixed. I think a few of them have honestly been people not reading carefully or truly knowing what their specs are.\n\nSCORE\n8.5/10 - and only because I demand more options out of building games having spent 3.5k in Gmod alone. This score will probably go up as the weeks and months go by.","January 21","true","26.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","10","13","2","1"

The things you can already achieve with a bearing, controller, button, switch, and sensor is quite awesome. You'll find yourself building a vehicle one way, just to find out you could do it better like this, wait... it would be better like THIS!...\n\nFive hours later..\n\nNow, there are some cons. Too many bearings will destroy your framerate. Destroy it. I've got a top-of-the-line PC and this thing wrecks it if get into more than forty bearings or so in an area... which... is unfortunate. So much for large builds, atm. This is an early access, but I would think it would be able to handle more.\n\nAll in all, very solid buy. Get it.

Best builder I've played so far.\n\nCould do with a support page of some kind for active users to give suggestions to developers on the fly as they discover something that could be improved upon in these early stages of development. Unless there already is something like this that I'm unaware of. a feature like this where direct communication with developers feel almost essential before a final release of a game with this much potential.\n\nVery excited about the survival/story mode and the possibilities there-in.\n\nthe art style is impeccable and a great choice for this type of game feels good to step out of the hyper realistic feels of most building sims or the far too unrealistic ones and jump into something that is complex enough to keep your mind busy but simple enough to just start building incredible or hilarious constructs.\n\nA little bit concerned about map sizes (feel they're a little too small) and lag caused by scene clutter or too many builds per scene. I encountered some performance issues (I have a reasonable PC running a GTX 980 ti) when I had a minimal base with folding doors and windows and 3 complex vehicle builds. In a building game you want to be able to show off a gallery of designs and models.\n\nWith that said two major features missing so far is the ability to eliminate an entire construct (instead of one piece at a time) and an undo function where eliminating one little block could inevitably ruin an entire design that took hours to build.\n\nHaving a community Workshop for this would be amazing to upload and share your creations with others and visa versa.\n\nDespite my negative points I have massive love for this game and feel that anyone who loves a good building sim would too.\n\n8/10","January 25","true","123.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

As of writing the review, the game version is 0.1.11, which means that it has a long road to go, until it gets to the complete version. It might get faster after it's up on steam, but at this point it's believing on the promises the devs made, and I already have trust issues with most early access titles in the past, that seemed really promising, but did not go in the way I thought they would.\nSee, the problem is, I see this as a promising game, but when it gets to thinking about the future of it, it can go many ways, and only a few make me want to play it. There are a lot of questions that the game does not answer. And we are not talking about the creative mode, we are talking about the other gamemodes, that will actually make the game challenging.\n\nWill it be more like Factorio, where you make automated factories for extracting resources, or do I have to grind everything like Minecraft?\nAre most of the stuff cosmetic, or would they have an actual use? The electricity panel, the pipes, etc.\nWould my car run out of fuel, so I'll have to extract fuel to make it run?\n\nIs it going to get more in-depth, or is it going to get more content to work with? I prefer the former, since I'm already tired of all the games that provide the second. Can you promise me that? No.\n\nFor example, I saw 'Multiplayer', and when you first hear multiplayer, you are thinking about a server list to join in. Nope, you make a world and invite your friends to play with. I personally am not fan of that kind of 'multiplayer'. I want to join and do stuff with random players, not convince my friends to buy the game, so I have to play it, in a specific hour, and a certain period of time. I don't want to be dependent on that, I want randoms that go around in circles and do stupid stuff, so I don't feel like the last person on the planet.\nWill it improve? Probably. Can you promise me that? No.\n\nThe game currently doesn't give me any info on how is it going to be developed further. Sure, I can ask the developers, but there are two factors - Player feedback, and realization. If most of the players want more content, and it gets more content, then I paid for a game other people want, not me. Then it's the realization, I might speculate all day how it's going to be done, but in the end, they are going to do it their way.\n\nSo, should you buy it? Depends.\nDo you want minecraft meets GMod? Yes.\nDo you want in-depth resource management, and complex contraptions that go beyond a house-car transformer? Wait, and see how it goes.\n\nIn the end, we've gotten to a stage where 'Early Access' titles are not even in Beta, nor Alpha, but merely Prototypes of the actual game.\n\nBasic controls. Check.\nCore mechanics. Check.\nMap to explore. Check.\n\nAnd by reaffirming the devs with all the positive reviews, and that it looks 'promising', you are going to see a lot of future titles, that are no more than prototypes that look 'promising'.\nCastle story also looked 'promising'.","January 22","false","1.1"," 294 of 558 people (53%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","53","294","558","29","51"

Well worth the money for the amount of time you will spend playing this. Lots of different blocks/parts to use to create almost anything you could imagine. Let your creativity go crazy. Building rockets and robots is always fun. Has everything that i wished minecraft had. This game has replaced minecraft for me. Very keen to see how the game develops as they add more objects to the game.\n\nLooking forward to the "survival" mode where the farm bots etc are involved.\n\nOnly problem i have come across is sometimes you can accidentally make a run away rocket/car. If you accidentally delete the drivers seat depending on how you have setup the activation for the thrusters or engine it can run away on you. If you are lucky it will get stuck in a tree and you can retrieve it using the lift to capture it, other times it is gone for good such as in the case of a run away rocket dissaprearing into the sky. This can be funny as you try to chase your runaway creation but othertimes it can be frustrating if you have spent a long time perfecting it. Lesson learnt though, dont delete the drivers seat unlesss its attached to the lift.\n\nTheres some interesting features that make the engineering side of things more realistic. Such as needing to consider weight vs power. For example one thruster may be able to launch a small craft, while if you build something heavy out of steel blocks then it will not and you will either need more thrusters or to reduce the weight. I have also noticed this happening with bearings used for moving parts such as doors etc. If it is a big heavy door made of steel blocks the single bearing may not have the power to lift it. Your options are then to create some sort of assistive mechanism or to recude the weight by replacing some steel blocks with something such as the medium weight beams or the light weight wooden blocks.\n\nThe weight balance can also affect your creations in other ways too. For example having lots of heavy blocks at the front of a flying craft and not much weight in the rear will cause it to nose dive. These little details mean you need to think more about balancing things out or adding counter weights.\n\nAll these extra features are not immediately apparent, and while the game can be simple, if you choose to optimise your creations then it can actually be quite deep thanks to these extra physics elements. Since there are ways to optimise your vehicles it would be nice to have a speedometer perhaps as part of the HUD when you enter a drivers seat so that there is a more measurable way to see what difference you may be making. eg. If you were trying to make the fastest car possible.","April 26","true","27.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jimmyperu/recommended/387990/","jimmyperu","Jimmy Peru","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jimmyperu/","76 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game was a wonderful surprise. Give credit to the developers, the promo vids say it all.\n\nPoured 15 hours into it. A huge amount of fun. The constructions people will make will be truly incredible. It boggles the mind when you realise after a few hours tinkering what could be possible, and the FUN you could have with friends. It forces you to think - sometimes you’ll just sit staring at your object as your brain melts - but at the same time is rewarding just to strap a few boosters on a chair to see what happens.\n\nI've spent hours alone on buildings and rooms, let alone the vehicles. If you like the graphic style there's enough content to build a great looking workshop, warehouse or cabin in the woods. And basically enough mechanics to turn your house into a walking robot, if you have the time, skill and patience.\n\nCurrently with creative mode only, you make up your own goals. The ambitious or creative mind of a mechanic is spoilt here. You realise the value of suspension, tune the engine, figure it might go faster with boosters, then make it fly, then balance the weight, make it float with sensors, then add a co-pilot, laughing the whole time at the disasters, then you watch a YouTube video and realise you've barely scratched the surface: You could literally create a flying warship with a manned bridge!\nNot that there’s any war yet.\nPlease can there be war?!\n\nAnd you look back at the bizarre creations you’ve cluttered the world with, with both fondness and failure. Occasionally stumbling over one that went rogue.\n\nAt the core of it, for me at least, it’s the construction mechanics that make it great. Whilst not perfect, the build controls are still slick, fast and intuitive. Much more than I initially realised. It pays you to get to grips with them fast.\n\nMultiplayer has worked well (for me at least). My girlfriend kept building milk floats, so I secretly turned the roof of our house into a rocket platform and invited her up there to press the button. No falling damage implemented yet, but still, for some reason, the funniest thing I've witnessed this year. And now we have a twinkling star up there in the atmosphere, constantly reminding me that I need to build a flying craft capable of getting out roof back.\n\nAs for PROBLEMS:\n- Ran smooth enough for 10 hours till I experienced the odd crash. That could be down to me now building a mega structure, so maybe I'm pushing it a little. Quick crash, quick restart, saves every few seconds as far as I can tell. Annoying but not a problem.\n- Get some odd ground vehicle movement in some areas of the map. It might be my design, but I think more likely the world bugging out slightly. Slightly annoying but not a problem.\n- Occasional bit of slow down or stuttering.\n- CPU running a little hot. I have an above average machine.\n- Cannot keymap certain keys. ALWAYS frustrating for me as I hate using WASD. AutoHotkey sorted that out so all good.\n- Lots of stuff needs tweaking, obviously.\n\nOverall pretty damn solid for an EA game, and I feel like I’ve had my monies worth already!\nThose that aren’t having the same experience as me I would imagine £15 a little steep. But I guess we take these risks on EA. Especially day 1.\n£10 might be a fairer price, but I will happily pay a little extra to support the devs. That is after all what you’re doing when you hit the Purchase button.\n\nDevs, please keep this up! I know you know we know you’ve got a gem here. Polish it!!!\nAnd give me missiles!\n\nRandom tip: When working on a huge structure, use the vehicle lift as a motorised scaffolding. Put it under a light floor and jump on. Bit easier to reach high places!\n\nEDIT: 50 hours in. Multiplayer experience is amazing with friends (connection through Steam is seamless) AS LONG AS it runs well on your system. We all need fair machines to play it due to lack of optimization.\nThe biggest problem is the frame drop when certain physics take hold. Basically big, heavy structures. Especially when they are resting on servos or suspension. You can have a HUGE amount of creative, collaborative fun, but don't think too big just yet...","January 21","true","70.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

You can build anything you want.\n2. There is multiplayer\n3. There is lots of building tools even for a alpha\n4. The games looks are nice to look at\n5. There is alot of replay value\n6.There will be a survival mode added some time soon\n7. You can play as a male for female\n8. There is a first and thirdperson with a FOV slider.\n9. The game can play on most computers (Im just using a little laptop not made for gaming and i get decent frames My settings are on low of course though)\n\nNow on to the negitives\n\n1. Atleast for me everytime i exit the server the game crashes and i lose about 5 mins of progress\n2. If you are playing multiplayer the server will lag a small bit\n3. Players in your game can destroy what you built i would understand a sorta raiding system in survival but not one in creative.\n4. With every early access game you dont know if it will be finished\n5. The game does bug out at times.\n6. No names over peoples heads in multiplayer.\n\nFinal verdict a 8.5/10","January 27","true","13.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It's early access, but you still have unlimited potential. You might be thinking, right off the bat, that twenty whole dollars is a lot for an early access. Usually, I'd agree, they should be 10 bucks or 15 bucks at most, but for the open-endedness of Scrap Mechanic, 20 is pretty fair.\n\nFirst off, for those of you that are on the edge:\nIf you like Besiege,\nIf you like Minecraft,\nIf you like any sort of in-depth construction game,Then Scrap Mechanic is your game!\n\nI don't really do it justice because you have to experience it, but there's a super-active community growing around it that definitely have videos and such up on the community page for you to check out.\n\nI'll give you some pros and cons regardless.\n\nPROS:-Super fun\n-Endless possibilites\n-You can make music\n-Good multiplayer (and it's only early access!)\n\nCONS:-Infrequent, somewhat small updates*\n-Requires pretty decent hardware, especially on multiplayer and with huge/mobile structures**\n-It's really hard to be creative on creative for me.\n\n*I could be out of the loop though, might be a huge update in the works.\n**I have a GTX660 so it might just be me.","May 23","true","14.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","5"

I bought this game with high expectations and I am very pleased with it so far. Stunning mechanics and physics, easy building system as well as a good explained tutorial when you first spawn into the game to get you started, and this is something I like, because in very many other games you're forced to spend hours figuring out the "real" basics out on your own. With that being said the list just goes on forever with what you can create in this game. The only thing that holds you back is your own mind and imagination.\n\nThe game (at its current stage is in beta) also has the Multiplayer mode available as well. Its very simple and with a press on alt+tab you can invite your friends directly to your private little world. It is worth mentioning that you might experience lag from the current server system but I wouldn't doubt that this is something the developers are already working more on.\n\nPros/Cons\n+ Beautiful game\n+ VERY Affordable Price\n+ Easy to learn\n+ Genious multiplayer system\n+ Amazing mechanics\n\n- Servers will need to get better","January 30","true","85.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's really fun, the concepts are awesome, it's easy to learn. Alot of the problems I have is that some of the games that have concepts like this is that they're too complex. Space Engineers for example is a really cool idea, it's just far too complex to stay interested in sometimes, while I'm sure I could figure it all out, it would take weeks to really master, this game you can get right into and start building. Houses, vehicles, flying contraptions, it's all possible.

(Save your money)\n\nThat said, if you like building type games that pose a challange, creativity and the freedom to experiment through trial and error then this is definetly the type of game for you.

Will you become the king of the sky and fly over plains, hills, factories, and much, much, more? Or maybe become the first Scrap Mechanic to reach space on your very own space craft? Or maybe even rule the huge land Scrap Mechanic has to offer and speed through forests, up huge mountains, down cliffs, and much more! Most Mechanics choose to use Scrap Mechanic for one use, to build, build, build vehicles. But uniquely, some use their knowledge and experience of making vehicles to build towns, cities, buildings and more. Some of the basic mechanics Scrap Mechanic has is Pilot, Astronaut, and Driver. But there are plently more types you are yet to discover.\nList of some Mechanics: 1. Pilot 2. Astronaut 3. Driver 4. Builder 5. Racer 6. Miner and much much more!\nJoin now =D! P.S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bitKoder/recommended/387990/","bitKoder","koder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bitKoder/","73 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nScrap Mechanic is exactly the sort of game where just you think you've seen it all, then someone comes out with this incredible new device powered by friction with ducks.\n\nThe machines you can build in this game are limitless, and with a little imagination you can get hundreds of hours out of this game. Once you start connecting bearings and configuring controllers, you'll find you can easily slip into the rhythm of things, and before you know it you'll be buiding walking robots and transforming houses. It's the perfect balance of simple and technical, sensible and hilarious. Which brings me to my next point.\n\nMultiplayer in Scrap Mechanic is laggy and buggy, but enormously fun. You'll quickly find yourself ramming your car into your friend's half-built motorbike, which will spasm into the air, adopting a variety of whacky positions, before settling back to the ground so you can do it again. Racing is also wildly entertaining, with cars falling over and turning off-course repeatedly if you're not careful. If you buy this game, I highly recommend you get a friend or family member to buy it too.\n\nOverall, Scrap Mechanic is a fabulous game. While it's a little rough around the edges, it's a great experience and an excellent way to learn about moving parts and how to use them to create the machines of your dreams!\n\n10/10 Would watch my friend's bike spasm again.","February 16","true","81.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","4","7","3","0"

Most of the cons I put are not even problems with the game, just personal opinions. It is a very smooth Early Access Game.\n\nUsually I'm not too serious with reviews, but man...this game. Let's start out with the Pros:\n\nPROS\n\n-Creativity. If you can think it, you can get it to work.\n\n-Incredibly easy to get ahold of. Vehicle building might take awhile to master, but it's a really cool concept.\n\n-Great multiplayer. The best part is if your friend is riding a vehicle, you click on them while holding the Lift item and put the Lift down. Have fun ;)\n\n-Lots of content, especially for an Early Access Game.\n\n-Multiple Block Placement: Remember playing Minecraft and you had to build a huge wall? Placing each individual block was a pain. But now you can place several blocks at a time. There is a limit, but it is much nicer.\n\nCONS\n\n-A little glitchy in Multiplayer. Now I was playing with my buddy and he was hosting a server while in a hotel room, so that might be why.\n\n- You can only connect one switch to one bearing at a time. If you were making a door, it really can only be one way. This is a little bit annoying as you'd have to make multiple entrances, so hopefully it will be fixed. But maybe that's just part of the game, I don't know.\n\n- This is just a personal annoyance: you can't fly in creative mode. Sure, you can make something that flies, but it would sure help with building if your character could fly. I was trying to make a monorail system and I just gave up because I had to go on the rail and build backwards. But if this isn't something they want to add, I understand completely.\n\n- No modes other than creative as of right now. However, it was comfirmed that they are going to add a Survival aspect so I look forward to that.\n\nThese cons aren't all that bad though. Seriously, if you're debating to buy Scrap Mechanic or not, just buy it. It is such a fun game and even though it might take a little time to master, it'll be worth it.","January 23","true","52.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

This is where I hoped Minecraft would go.  Minecraft is digital primitive Lego.   Scrap Mechanic is Lego Mindstorms.\n\nI had a blast with the first bit of time I have spent with it.  I was able to get it to run on my surface pro 3.  Doesn't look pretty, but it makes up for it with fun. I built s very simple goofy car at lunch and was cracking up driving it around.  I had no issues getting it to work and am looking forward to playing on my main rig at home.  There is a lot of potential with this game and I can only see it getting bigger and better as time goes on.  One of the better early access titles on day one.\n\nGraphics - are good (basing it off surface Intel hd abilities)\nFun - lots there and to be had\nMechanics and game play - Simple to figure out and easy to use. It will allow you to do some pretty cool stuff if you are willing to put some effort into it.  Imagination is the only limit here.\n\nTotally worth the 20$\n\nLooking forward to the updates.

Duggy is my favourite and I love him.\n\nSo far I'm having a blast with the game and I would recommend it to everyone who enjoys creative games and outside-the-box thinking. The controls/mechanics are very intuitive and 'make sense', at least that's how I would describe it. There is so much awesome potential here, I can't wait for possible mods/workshop implementation. Since I have no friends who play this game, I can't say much for Multiplayer yet, but I bet it's even more fun than SP.\nNow, if you are a player who only enjoys games where you have 'stuff to do', like quests/objectives/survival or are one of those 'arrghh kill11l evry1!!! pew pew pew!" types, you probably won't enjoy it. The former, because so far only creative has been implemented and the latter, well that's kinda obvious.\nThe price does seem a bit steep for an early access title, but I for one know already that I will get my 20 bucks worth of gameplay out of it even if it doesn't develop any further (worst scenario). If it's too expensive for you, just wait until it's on sale or till it's developed further to buy. Because if you really enjoy gameplay like that this game is for you.\nA few technical things:\nIt runs  okay on my mid-range laptop (30-35 fps low settings) and it still looks good, too. The only bug I encountered so far is the crash on exit but nothing else. I didn't try MP yet, so can't say if there are any problems there but SP is fine.","January 20","true","9.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I cannot wait to see what the future has in store for Scrap Mechanic.\n\nEarly Alpha Review:\nThe physics are simply fun. The building mechanic is unique to say the least. I had great fun just building simple trucks and giant cars. I can see this game becoming something big with a few updates to the survival aspect of the game (which is not here yet). The only mode in this state of the game is creative. I have not gotten a chance to experience multiplayer yet, but I could only imagen the fun I could have with some buddies in this game. Overall I would recommend this alpha due to the uniqueness of the building mechanics. People are going to be making some crazy things in this game and I can't wait to see it!\n\nIf you like building weird things and messing around for hours on end, you would enjoy this game.\n","January 20","true","22.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I had a look at the items already in the game and feel like I will be putting a lot of time into trying everything, making lots of weird machines and vehicles. The movement in the game has a polished feel already. If they eventually add a survival mode and a balanced way to collect resources to build, some kind of mobs and some tiered weapons to deal with them. The multiplayer aspect will be awesome.\n\nRight now, if you have some friends to play with, don’t mind just building things. I would recommend trying it. In my opinion, $20 is a good price for what you currently have access to. If you are looking to struggle to stay alive, gather resources to build etc.. Keep monitoring the games progress. But with all early access games, educate yourself about the game and make your decision wisely.\nAlthough day 1 this early access title is already way ahead of others that have been in early access for a year.","January 20","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","1","2","2","0"

As of right now the game has quite a few major/minor bugs, but that is the price to pay when you buy an early access game. I reccomend getting this game if you're into building, and engineering in games.\n\nCons\n\n- Occasionally crashes when exiting a world, or randomly during play.\n\n- Game crashes usually after building 3-5 vehicles.\n(not a problem on my end, I have confirmed this.)\n\n- If you hit the ground too hard with your wheels they\nwill get stuck in the ground and you'll have to replace game now I\nyour car.\n\n- Map is pretty small atm, made a rocket but it couldn't\ngo very far due to the world border.\n\n- Not enough to do right now, I think this game is\npromising so I'll give it time.\n\nPros\n\n- Really ♥♥♥♥in fun if you play with a friend\n\n- Rewarding when you make something that works well.\n\n- Very promising game, if you don't like the game now I suggest checking it out in the future.\n\n- You can build a mufukin ATAT.","January 23","true","6.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I've yet to encounter anything gamebreaking or too wonky so far. The basic mechanics of the game seem to work great, the game runs well and looks pretty good.

Gmod has dupes, Minecraft has world downloads/mods, even Halo Reach can transfer forge worlds safely.

I like it but then I would because I like sandboxes and physics.\n\nThere are not a whole lot of block types yet. Hopefully they come up with a block that can be whatever color you choose. The bearing parts and how they function are pure genius, good job.\nThere are a lot of places that this game could go if the devs put the effort in!!\n\nI wish there was a timer part that could control switches on / off functions based on time.\nWhat about an accelerometer that could turn switches on / off based on angle?\nOr how about some aerodynamic simulation..  like rudders and wings and propellers?\nWhat about a remote control seat so you can pilot something from another place?\n\nI would like to see some more complicated physics parts too.  A physics part that can make blocks slide in the track of another part  (for example the lift on a fork lift).  Also, maybe a few different sized pulleys and a cable that can go with it.\nWhat about naming a collection of parts, like "car" for example. Then a tool that can teleport you to that object and a tool that could delete an object in its entirety.\n\n\nThe suspensions cant really be complex. it cannot be connected at an angle (example:  to make something like a halo warthog)\n\nOverall, I would say that it is a great little sandbox to goof around in and I really hope the devs continue to improve on this.. cannot wait to see what they have in mind for this game.\n","January 23","true","16.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I had a look at the items already in the game and feel like I will be putting a lot of time into trying everything, making lots of weird machines and vehicles. The movement in the game has a polished feel already. If they eventually add a survival mode and a balanced way to collect resources to build, some kind of mobs and some tiered weapons to deal with them. The multiplayer aspect will be awesome.\n\nRight now, if you have some friends to play with, don’t mind just building things. I would recommend trying it. In my opinion, $20 is a good price for what you currently have access to. If you are looking to struggle to stay alive, gather resources to build etc.. Keep monitoring the games progress. But with all early access games, educate yourself about the game and make your decision wisely.\nAlthough day 1 this early access title is already way ahead of others that have been in early access for a year.","January 20","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","1","2","2","0"

If you build anything big the lag will kill you. Other than that if you want to build wacky fast flying things it certainly lets you. One drawback is if you accidently delete your drivers seat your creation will fly off into the sunset only to be seen but never touched again. You can build in 2 worlds, one is flat and empty I suggest using this one. The other is full of hills and trees which basicaly stop you driving or flying about. I built a big fold up flying castle , with stairs, toilets and walls all appearing as if from nowhere only for my first flight lasting 10 seconds into a fatal dissaster........

If you don't know about it it is like a side what if you had the machine building madness from garry's mod in a minecraft esq world just with 80% less blocks. Now the game is not finished, but I can tell the developers are giving the game more love and attention than a parent does to their child. I can't wait to see what comes out in the future and I recommend that anyone who sees this give the game a shot and if you don't like it after that just wait because more will be added later and ou might want to give it another chance then.","May 3","true","38.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The devs were super hyped for a long time about adding glass blocks, but there still is no way to connect more than two buttons to a controller. So when I build a house, I can look out my nice see through windows, but I have to dedicate an entire floor of my building to housing the 13 controllers I need to open all my doors. They also added a driver's seat that could fit in a 3 block wide vehicle, for symmetry purposes. They failed to remedy the engine that is still 2x2. So I can have a nice 1 block wide vehicle, but my engine is stuck hanging out on one side or the other. They need to focus on the bigger picture and make common sense decisions. I've already played more than two hours, so my chance of getting a refund is small. I guess I'll play the game in a month or two and see what has improved. This game would be way better with friends, but I wouldn't honestly convince them to buy this game *as it sits*. Hopefully it's better in a while, but right now, I'd suggest you look at Homebrew or SimplePlanes instead.","May 25","false","6.5"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

I like how things are represented with clear pictures, and not words, sprites, or anything along those lines.\n\nI can't wait to see what other things people can do with the game's mechanics.\n\nMy one complaint however, would be bugs with the movement and driving. I've come across times where my character freaks out from the car, and gets rubberbanded into one direction, and drags the car with him. Also, occasionally when someone leaves the server I can only move in one direction and I can't build. These might be related to the internet connection however, but I'd like to see it changed.\n\nIn conclusion, Scrap Mechanic is a great game I'd like to play for many hours, days, weeks, months, and maybe years if the developers create fresh content to add into the game. 10/10.","January 20","true","5.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","1"

Once there are some survival/difficulty methods added into the game I can find myself playing more than I do now, which is just to get the basics down. It would also be neat as well as if there will be digging and voxel terrain (making digging/logging machines would be really neat to gain materials). The sky is the limit, really for this game.\n\nI also don't think I've had a game where I've had fun making contraptions like this since Lego Creator back on Windows 98. Think Besiege but sandbox worlds rather than levels. It's intuitive, yet super simple. All it needs now is explosions to be like Lego Creator! xD\n\nThere are a couple of things so far that need fixing, such as adding pre-built parts onto other machines, a way to clear clutter from the ground, as well as throttles compared to toggle and hold button options. Pulley systems would be nice. Customized key presses would also be great for buttons you place on a controlled vehicle. I'm sure things like these will be added in time, though.\n\nDefinitely worth the investment at $20 I would say. Would recommend.","January 21","true","8.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicWinn/recommended/387990/","EpicWinn","EpicMega","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicWinn/","104 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n*************2 hour review:*************\nBrief summary:\nSo far, this feels very very much like an early Banjo and Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts remaster. I'm enjoying it a lot, and although it may be early, it is still very fun and even though there are few items to mess around with, you can still build things beyond belief with the right imagination. There are a few downsides, as it is in early access, which means you only get creative mode, and a lot of the main parts of the game to be are missing, such as the functionality of fuel tanks, pipes, wires, and the entire farming aspect has been yet to be put in.\n\n-Gameplay:\nIt is overall a very fun game to play. There are a decent number of things to build with, including stuff like steel beams, wood blocks, metal blocks, concrete blocks, and etc. The ideas around the whole building process are very simple, as you place things down called "bearings" on top of blocks and place a block on top of that in order to get a joint. You can create large systems of things through using buttons and switches that connect up to these bearings, including a very fine angle tuning to how far you want the bearings to go to. Of course, main parts of the gameplay are indeed missing, but the basic frame has been put down to build off of, and I believe if they stick to this, it should be very promising.\n\n-Multiplayer:\nI have noticed that the game can be a bit jittery as of now in terms of lag in multiplayer, but that's to be assumed while the game's devs work out the net coding. Learning how to build things together seems to be a good option and can provide hours of fun while trying to figure things out. Fun overall, but trying to do complicated things with only a decent internet cannot provide much of an experience.\n\n-Updates:\nIn the short time this game has been out, I have noticed many small updates to fix bugs in high frequency, so I am very satisfied as of the date of this review. The devs seem to be very dedicated to making sure the bugs get squashed out right now.\n\n-Bugs and Crashes:\nAgain, to be expected with an early access game, but it does indeed have many bugs as of now. I've crashed twice so far and within a two hour span, had my friend crash around 3-4 times. Normal gameplay seems to be working fine, however, if you try to do other things such as leave to the menu or create a new game, I've noticed random crashes here and there. I'll try to indicate if any of these updates iron out these issues.\n\n-Graphics:\nThe graphics are very good for a new game, and at their highest setting, they can definitely be taxing on even a decent machine. I cannot run some of the highest settings with my GTX 760 4GB without getting around 20-30 fps at best. When I did try all the highest settings, it did look very pretty though. There's was a lot of detail that made the landscape look very lush.\n\nOverall, I'd rate this 6.5/10 for an early access game as of now with hope for the potential it has (as of 1/24/2016). Fully finished and I would definitely give it a score of at least 8.5/10. It is definitely recommended to have friends who you can mess around with in the game who have a decent internet connection in order to get the full fun factor.","January 24","true","2.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Only came out 4 days ago as of when this review was written. Insane potential to make lots of cool ♥♥♥♥ with friends whether it be your own little mini games, Entire Mechinical towns, new vehicles never made before, etc. If a survival mode is added (it probably will be from the looks of it) You could make transportation between houses whether it be  railways, vehicles, or making your entire house a car! (Which is already possible) Literally whatever you can imagine. Also, for the people who might look at that as a minecraft clone, its not. The Mechanics are completly different. The only thing simular is the use of Voxel. So take what I say if you will and TRY THIS GAME.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicWinn/recommended/387990/","EpicWinn","EpicMega","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicWinn/","104 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n*************2 hour review:*************\nBrief summary:\nSo far, this feels very very much like an early Banjo and Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts remaster. I'm enjoying it a lot, and although it may be early, it is still very fun and even though there are few items to mess around with, you can still build things beyond belief with the right imagination. There are a few downsides, as it is in early access, which means you only get creative mode, and a lot of the main parts of the game to be are missing, such as the functionality of fuel tanks, pipes, wires, and the entire farming aspect has been yet to be put in.\n\n-Gameplay:\nIt is overall a very fun game to play. There are a decent number of things to build with, including stuff like steel beams, wood blocks, metal blocks, concrete blocks, and etc. The ideas around the whole building process are very simple, as you place things down called "bearings" on top of blocks and place a block on top of that in order to get a joint. You can create large systems of things through using buttons and switches that connect up to these bearings, including a very fine angle tuning to how far you want the bearings to go to. Of course, main parts of the gameplay are indeed missing, but the basic frame has been put down to build off of, and I believe if they stick to this, it should be very promising.\n\n-Multiplayer:\nI have noticed that the game can be a bit jittery as of now in terms of lag in multiplayer, but that's to be assumed while the game's devs work out the net coding. Learning how to build things together seems to be a good option and can provide hours of fun while trying to figure things out. Fun overall, but trying to do complicated things with only a decent internet cannot provide much of an experience.\n\n-Updates:\nIn the short time this game has been out, I have noticed many small updates to fix bugs in high frequency, so I am very satisfied as of the date of this review. The devs seem to be very dedicated to making sure the bugs get squashed out right now.\n\n-Bugs and Crashes:\nAgain, to be expected with an early access game, but it does indeed have many bugs as of now. I've crashed twice so far and within a two hour span, had my friend crash around 3-4 times. Normal gameplay seems to be working fine, however, if you try to do other things such as leave to the menu or create a new game, I've noticed random crashes here and there. I'll try to indicate if any of these updates iron out these issues.\n\n-Graphics:\nThe graphics are very good for a new game, and at their highest setting, they can definitely be taxing on even a decent machine. I cannot run some of the highest settings with my GTX 760 4GB without getting around 20-30 fps at best. When I did try all the highest settings, it did look very pretty though. There's was a lot of detail that made the landscape look very lush.\n\nOverall, I'd rate this 6.5/10 for an early access game as of now with hope for the potential it has (as of 1/24/2016). Fully finished and I would definitely give it a score of at least 8.5/10. It is definitely recommended to have friends who you can mess around with in the game who have a decent internet connection in order to get the full fun factor.","January 24","true","2.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Runs extremely good, really nice graphics and no bugs found yet. For the future i would like to see much more items to play with, chains for example, more wheels? wings?, and other stuff. But for now, (just released to early access) you can play with many things. Maybe the map could be bigger, or atleast without the fence, that for me it looks like if i'm trapped in a prison or something like that. But ye, if you like games like building games (like minecraft for example) this game clearly is one step further than that.

I would really like if you can add the possibility to connect blocks from different structures together. One example is if I want to build a tank thread. To make the tank thread I have to use bearings and the problem is to connect the tank thread in the end to make it a full circle. Right now, this is impossible.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xepii/recommended/387990/","Xepii","Xepi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xepii/","93 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is truly amazing! It has all the key elements to build magnificent vehicles and mechanisms. You may say to your self: "Why isnt there a piston-like thing that can push objects of make an elevator?" Well, just by thinking smart and complex you will figure it out. It can be VERY complex and technical and it is sooo rewarding to see the result after you have built it. The game has the fundamental to build whatever you want if you just have the creativity and intelligence. aaaaand it has online which is awesome.\n\nWith that said, there are some things I would like to see added in furture patches and some performance issues and other stuff. About the performance, the game doesnt run at 60fps on my AMD R9 290X on a empty world. and my friends that have NVIDIA does. BUT something that happends with both cards is that when the map starts to fill up with a lot of creations with a lot of things connected to it at once, it starts to lag dramaticly... we are talking down to 10fps reguardless of video card. That is because it is too many entities that is active at once. So that is a optimalization problem that Axolot Games have to figure out!\n\nAbout the online part: It is sooo fun to play with friends, but what is a bummer is that only the host has the save. So if you make a creation on a friends save, you can only access it when he starts the save from his local computer. You can always send your save files to your freinds tho. Also, having 4 people building at the same time.... it doesnt take long before the FPS closes to 10-15fps.\n\nMy overall experience with the game is a 9/10, it is just up my alley. I just hope that Axelot Games fixes some of the performance issues for AMD. and im looking forward to seeing new content in the furture!\n\nGREAT GAME, I RECOMMEND!","January 25","true","70.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Maybe the map could be bigger, or atleast without the fence, that for me it looks like if i'm trapped in a prison or something like that. But ye, if you like games like building games (like minecraft for example) this game clearly is one step further than that.

There is still a lot to work on such as lag appearing as soon as you have a lot of physics happening at the same time\n2. There isn't much content to build with (At this point of the review) but I am almost certain that this will be added in future updates\n\nP.S.

As a game that myfriends play regularly, it sucks. It is quite laggy and no vey compatible with multiplaye unless you have a good computer. However, when playing for several hours at a time, you find fun in the simple parts of the games. I am a seasoned beta tester, so I am quite judge-y when it comes to reviews. iIreccomend this game to anyone who is creative and  has time to kill.

Its like minecraft, take away alot of stuff, add nicer graphics easier and more redstoney stuff and boots, toilets, baby ducks and toilet roll. 7/10. (Please make windows add the windows game bar when on this game.)

I started loving that game after 15 minutes game-time! I can´t wait to build my own stuff! Maybe there will be a Workshop to upload your stuff for other players?

The instrucion book you get ingame is really helpful to not be a total noob in that game.\n\nThe Performance is really good too, i do not have the recommended graphicscard (i got a GTX 460.. for now) and it runs perfectly smooth without any FPS problems.\n\nOh.. and please add the abillity to add more stuff to one button / lever / sensor, its really hard to build a 2-way door because you have to do OR-Gates or NOT-Gates and that takes a lot of time to build :/\n\n11/10 - LOVE it!\n\n\n... oh, and sorry if my english is not the yellow from the egg >_<","January 20","true","7.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A couple buddies and I bought the game and are really enjoying it. But no matter how much i love the game for how it is, the multiplayer needs some work, as in (and im not sure if this is just us but...) things get very slidey when you move, and creations (specifically vehicles) have a high chance of freaking out and flying and teleporting all over the map, other than for the host. What i mean by other than for the host is that the vehicles are not actually flying around crazily but to the clients they are, making it very difficult to do anything involving said vehicles.

I'll be looking forward to public servers. Here is a recap of what this game is going to get you and if it's worth your dime.\n\nFirstly: *This is based on an Early Access review.\n\nPros\n- Runs Smoothly (780ti SLI and i74770k)\n- Parts fit nicely together\n- Game HAS TONS of potential.\n- Fun SOLO gameplay as well as Co-Op\n\nCons\n- Few Parts *you can get quite creative though\n- Small Map\n- No Public Servers\n- No "Hydraulics" (Can be engineered w/ bearings)\n\nIn this games current state you'll get a couple of hours before your fun runs out. You MUST be creative and use logic to build things. Honestly if you aren't creative don't waste your money. You have to find ways to make bearings do all the work. This game has a very bright future ahead of it. I'm glad to have purchased and feel this will be the next KSP.

Primarily focused on vehicle creation, Scrap Mechanic offers a simpler, younger version of garry's mod sandbox. This is not a minecraft clone. The developer chose to use blocks as a building resource as many other games has, and that is the only relation to minecraft I can see. At the moment, there is only creative mode(I am assuming there will be more modes considering there was a world mode option at world creation). The item/building selections are pretty limited, although this is where the developer dedication would kick in. With more content(and we can assume more content as this is an early early-access game), I wouldn't be surprised if I spend 300+ hours in this game.\n\nPros:\n-Great creation engine, mechanics just work without you understanding how to use them\n-Cool graphical design\n-Not as buggy as other 0.x games are\n-Tons of possibilities, no "skill cap"\nCons:\n-Item/block selection is pretty limited\n-Only 1 map to play on, although it is a good sandbox map\n-Flawed saving system(cannot manually save, autosaves at random intervals)\n-Some people report starting crashes\n\nShould I buy this game?: At it's current state it could be worth a gamble if you are itching for a new creative toolkit. If $20 is a substantial amount of money you might want to hold off until it has more content.\n","January 22","true","6.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A couple buddies and I bought the game and are really enjoying it. But no matter how much i love the game for how it is, the multiplayer needs some work, as in (and im not sure if this is just us but...) things get very slidey when you move, and creations (specifically vehicles) have a high chance of freaking out and flying and teleporting all over the map, other than for the host. What i mean by other than for the host is that the vehicles are not actually flying around crazily but to the clients they are, making it very difficult to do anything involving said vehicles.

I'll be looking forward to public servers. Here is a recap of what this game is going to get you and if it's worth your dime.\n\nFirstly: *This is based on an Early Access review.\n\nPros\n- Runs Smoothly (780ti SLI and i74770k)\n- Parts fit nicely together\n- Game HAS TONS of potential.\n- Fun SOLO gameplay as well as Co-Op\n\nCons\n- Few Parts *you can get quite creative though\n- Small Map\n- No Public Servers\n- No "Hydraulics" (Can be engineered w/ bearings)\n\nIn this games current state you'll get a couple of hours before your fun runs out.

I'll be looking forward to public servers.

You MUST be creative and use logic to build things. Honestly if you aren't creative don't waste your money. You have to find ways to make bearings do all the work.

I couldn't play it for months... When I open the game, bugsplatter shows up, everytime I send bug reports with my e-mail but no one returned. No one cared... This game is like a dead body lying in my library.\n\nAlthough gameplay is so impressive, its fun. I would've play it if it opens. But its a bad review just because I can't play","March 20","false","15.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"
