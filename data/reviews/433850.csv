It was quick, full of people, very competitive, always gave you that rush. It was good for alpha, but then you started to notice something.\n- The map sucks. Its like if you had spent 2 hours on far cry 2 editor. No details at all. Same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vegetation brush everywhere.\n- 3 main weapons: shotgun, ar15 and ak47. So poor.\n- Queues to play. Such long queues. Was it that expensive to buy more servers? Oh wait...thats what the next point kicks right in.\n- Developers only care about money. For real. Updates only had small fixes like "ak now is a bit less powerful" or "car speed reduced" and all the rest was about 100 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ skins for which you have to buy keys and crates. Its such a rip off. Its an alpha game, for ♥♥♥♥s sake, and they charge you like millions for skins. Winning battle royale only gives you horrible loot which is absolutely worthless, because, of course, they do not want you to get cool content by winning and proving yourself to be good, no, they want you to spend more moneyz in their alpha game which will never be completed except for the fantastic crate&key system. They even have their in-game money. Why? So they can control the price of keys. It would be fatal for them if people could sell keys or crates.\nIts so disgusting to see that as soon as they get some fame, they instantly forget about the game and start looking for all kinds of ideas to rip you off. It bothered me so hard that my ingame name in DayZ SA is "H1Z1Sucks".\nSeriously, only buy this game if all you care is about BUYING content that otherwise you would get for free. In addition (but last) their ♥♥♥♥in brilliant bussinessmen came up with the idea of splitting the game in two, so that instead of having one alpha game with two game modes, they had 2 broken alpha games for each 20€. And the worst is, they tried to make us believe it was because "they wanted to focus more".\n\nOh, and as I write I remember another thing, the "Green Battle royal" or whatever it was called. They realised people only played for the BR mode, so they thought "Hey, could we charge them for playing BR mode? Oh yea we can, but lets disguise it as a new mode with extra luxury weapon skins". Then you win the br green and you check your AR15 skin and realise they only put 30 seconds in sprayin some green ♥♥♥♥♥♥ brush over the model. ♥♥♥♥in brilliant.","April 21","false","5.0"," 312 of 353 people (88%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","88","312","353","41","5"

Do not support unethical price gouging.\nThe developer has a long history of releasing buggy, unoptimized, and overall terrible games ripe with microtransactions, and this one is no different.  They LIED about it going free to play, and then split their game in half, doubling the total price before it's even out of Alpha. This is not okay!\n\nThis change is nothing but a dirty cash grab.  Daybreak as a company has a track record of failure and will do anything to try to get out of the red, and this is a prime example.\n\nThey haven't released a quality game in over 15 years.  With all due respect to their employees and their livelihoods, this company should have been abolished years ago.  It has been driven into the ground repeatedly by poor management, and compounded by lousy investments from both Sony and Columbus Nova.\n\nNo one talks about it, but there is no guarantee this game will even be available to play in months, let alone years. In 2014 Daybreak (then SOE) reportedly lost Sony $60 million, and now just one year after being sold off, this is the kind of gouging they're trying to pull on customers.  Not enough red flags for you? They've had multiple huge layoffs over the years,  at times completely devestating their customer support and quality assurance teams.\n\nIf your battle royale itch needs scratching, I'd recommend Rust or ARK. Both games have survival and BR modes, both are backed by more committed developers that aren't just there to separate your money from your wallet.","February 18","false","0.1"," 427 of 524 people (81%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","81","427","524","27","20"

We are now paying double for a PRE-ALPHA version of a game mode that was already included in the main game: H1Z1. This is very clearly a cash grab. When you start developing a game, you don't decide to split it up and double up costs due to your company's own lack and misuse of budget. You are punishing the players and the community for a mistake in your own development. When you create a game and promise to keep it fresh and updated at least until release you keep the game running and keep the features coming. Both of which are not happening in this case due to a shady / money hungry development team. If you promise F2P in the future for your buggy PRE-ALPHA game and decide to go back on that promise PLUS go one further and make your incoming player base pay double for the same game we had prior to this split, you don't deserve the playerbase. For all players, new and old, we now have to buy skins for both "games" which are basically the same game and inventory format.

They wernt.\n\nBetween the cheaters, glitches and all around incompletness of the game after....however many years now, i can not recommend anyone to play this game. Rather than fixing these issues, they release more microtransactions. Another example of incompetancy was when they finally claimed to fix 1 pre-game bug that was a little annoying (exploding car/tombstone); then before even releasing said update, decide to do away with the whole lobby system instead for apperantly having some massive internal revelation of a better way to have a pregame lobby.\n\nIf you dont see why this is an issue, then youre probably dumb enough to play this game. This game is spinning its wheels and going absolutely nowhere. They still have the same handful of items since launch (their wiki lies and says 660, but they include airdrop tickets, emotes, and shl tty variations of the same item; like backpacks).\n\nAnd the worst thing?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tryingdutchman/recommended/433850/","tryingdutchman","Swift","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tryingdutchman/","342 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHaving played a lot of Battle Royal in H1Z1 (before they split the game), I can say this game mode is pretty fun. But, it is just ONE game mode. So, ask yourself if it is worth buying a 20€ game for just ONE gamemode, a gamemode previously part of another game!?\n\n-----\n\nDaybreak claims that they will be adding more gamemodes, but that's yet to be seen. We don't know what gamemodes or how many will be added. Reading the early acces page they claim to add additional gamemodes and game rules. Judging the history of this game/development, I would not be supprised if they only add slight variations of the ONE gamemode Battle Royal.\n\nBefore the split, there already where 3 variants of this game mode, you had one without zombies, one with zombies and one with special rewards for winning! This last mode was behind a cash wall and you need to buy tickets for real hard cash to join this mode.\n\nTechnicly they could say they have 3 gamemodes. Then you have the same game with team of 2, or team of 5 players. So there you have it, 5 gamemodes! :P\n\nWe have to wait and see what the new gamemodes are, if any are added!\n\nAsk yourself, knowing this, is ONE gamemode still worth 20€?\n\n-----\n\nLet's inform you some more, because this game has a rocky history with many claims that never became reality!\n\nThey ones claimed to NEVER add pay2win mechanics to this game, then airdrops where added to survival mode that gave you food, water, weapons and ammo! Airdrops are behind a paywall from real hard cash! Though they changed the way this works but still ...\n\nThey claimed this game would become free2play ones released. Guess what, it's 20€ with additional supply crates and cosmatic microtransactions! Even payed gamemodes like the Battle Royal variant (Green Dawn) and airdrops for ingame loot.\n\nAgain, ask yourself, is this game worth 20€, with possible new gamemodes behind cash wall, with micro transactions and many broken promises?\n\nThen the worst part, the recent split of H1Z1 into two games.\n\nThis game, King of the Kill, was part of the original H1Z1. You had survival servers and Battle Royal servers! Now you have the survival game, 20€ and the battle royal game for another 20€! And what would happen if say a new gamemode is added to King of the Kill, which becomes very popular, will they split agian? Who knows!?\n\nThis split would not be the worst of things, if they cut the price in half. Would be fair since they cut the game in half but nope, now you pay 2x20€ for something that ones was 1x20€, for something that ones was promised to be free2play!\n\nAlso, remember you now need to pay double for microtransactions. Getting a new piece of clothing from a microtransaction was universal availible for all servers and gamemodes. Now, if you want that same piece of clothing be prepared to buy the same item twice!!!\n\nKnowing all of this, ask yourself is ONE gamemode worth 20€?\n\n-----\n\nWith this out of the way you might want to know if this ONE gamemode is fun and yes, I said I have lots of fun with this gamemode. So let's get into that!\n\nYou spawn with around 150 other players on a large open map. Everyone drops down from the sky with a parasute. It's now time to land as fast as you can, so you can be the first to loot weapons, ammo, backpacks and more. So you can be the first to blast others in the face.\n\nAfter a few minutes a savezone is drawn on your map, because toxic fog will be released and slowly drive you towards the savezone. This mechanic is fun and usefull to drive the remaining players towards the same spot.\n\nThough there is only ONE map it's big enough to be fun for a long time. Mainly because a lot of things are random. Not the map itself but your spawn location is random, weapon spawns are random and the savezones are random. One match ends in an urban location and another on top of the mountains.\n\nAll seems good, but there is also a lot wrong with the game and it's mechanics!\n\nSpawning for example! You don't spawn at the same time as your enemies. It depends on your loading time, internet connection and random bad luck (sometimes the game takes 2 or 3 times longer to load). This means people with faster hardware and internet connection land faster, getting guns fasters and thus have an increased change to win!\n\nNext problem is that hitbox detection and netcode are so random. With a bit of bad luck you can shoot somebody in the head for multiple times without them dieing. While other times you one hit kill them.\n\nSame with the shotgun, it's spread pattern is random. So you can almost get sniped from long distance with a shotgun while other times you can't hit/kill somebody at close range! And it's all luck, or badluck depending how it ends!\n\nOn top of that there aren't many weapons and in the end it comes down to AR15 for long range, shotgun for close range. Perhaps the AK47 (though it got nerved) or if you are lucky the hunting rifle (sniper that only drops from airdrops). All the other weapons are just useless compared to the above, so bows, crossbows and pistols are ignored! You only use them if they are the first weapon you can find early game.\n\n-----\n\nEventhough this gamemode is a lot of fun, even with all it's flaws, I can't recommend it to anyone! Specially knowing that this ONE gamemode was part of another game!\n\nPerhaps if they fix the core issues (spawning, hitbox detection, etc) and add more gamemodes AND lower the price to 10€ or less, then and only then it might become worth it!\n\nFor now, it's a big NO NO. Not recommended!","February 19","false","12.3"," 61 of 67 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","61","67","7","0"

Biggest waste of 20 bucks there is. Bought this game a long time ago before the two h1z1's separated and you know I played from time to time. And so the separation came and I forgot my password like some of us do as well right? Yeah so I feel like playing this game for the first time in a month but I'm locked out of my account. All cool I try to reset my password but in order to do this I need to provide a secret question that I CANT RECALL MAKING. So I decided to write to the support of H1Z1 in order to get my account back and so I see some pages that they have on getting your account back and stuff and I see :\n\nReal name:\nDaybreak Username:\nName on Credit Card:\nThe last 4 digits of the Credit Card used on the account:\nCurrent answer to your Security Question:\n\nAnd thats the information I cant provide since I don't know the answer to my secret question but Hey theres another option -\n\nIf you do not have all of the above information, please prepare as much of the following information as you can:\n\nThe full billing address:\nE-mail address:\n\nAnd I'm like alright let me do that then and so I do then I wait 2 days for a response which is pretty ridicolous. Okay all good they reply but their response is that I need to provide the answer to my security question before we keep going with the recovery of the account which as I already said I didn't make therefore I don't know the answer to. And I say so in the reply but they keep on insisting on the security question which I don't know and the guy said that if I don't answer he will close the support ticket and so he did.

Sadly griefers are making it less fun (more about it below).\n\nQ: Is this game pay to win?\nA: NO. You can buy only cosmetic stuff by opening crates. Airdrops are dropped by server in KOTK, unlike in JS (survival portion of the game) where you can buy airdrops for money.\n\nAt first we had to deal with cheaters. Now we have more modes, less cheaters, but griefing is really insane:\n- solo modes - people team up and make it really hard to win alone\n- team modes - people chase teammates instead of enemies, and force you to kill them or run away from them\n\nJust fix ♥♥♥♥ing griefing already. I'm tired of teamkilling ♥♥♥♥♥ in team modes, and I'm tired of teaming ♥♥♥♥♥ in non-team modes. Fix your ♥♥♥♥ing game for ♥♥♥♥ sake.\n\nTO RECAP: DO NOT BUY until Daybreak fixes teamkilling problem by either removing it, implimenting mirror friendly fire instead or start threating those abusive ♥♥♥♥ers as cheaters and baning them.","March 4","false","109.6"," 85 of 110 people (77%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","77","85","110","9","1"

However, the other 80% of the time, you'll want to rip your hair out, break your peripherals, and curse the developers. Vast majority of deaths are inexplicable -- for instance, you may shoot someone point blank with a shotgun only for that person to do the same to you and you are the only to die. When the death screen comes up, that person still has 70+ hp often regardless of whether or not they had armour. I could go on and on. Development is a disgrace. This game is a minimum of two years out from being a releasable game because the developers rarely update the game. When they do, they often improve one thing but degrade or break one or two other aspects. Is it worth 20 dollars? Yeah. Will you hate yourself for playing? Definitely.

While wating the game either crashes or places me into a completely random game, disregarding the party i queued with in the lobby.The one time I made it all the way into a game with my friends, my framerate was severally more unstable then it was before the update splitting the game. The frames stuttered like my 1200$ pc was actually a 200$ laptop. This game is now broken and i will be opting out of the new updated version that brought two seperate games. I wish i could refund, as i did not buy H1Z1 Kotk or H1Z1 Just survive. I bought H1z1, a survival/battle royal game that was working its way to F2P and availability on Xbox, PS4, and PC. Instead Ive gotten a sluggish, DAYZ developement team who makes DAYZ-esque updates and slowly chokes out each and every member of the community that used to enjoy the game, who makes a F2P game 40$ and makes a skin market because 40$ isn't enough money for them to not positively develop a simple survival genre game.","February 20","false","19.5"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","28","31","0","0"

The split was unnecessary and it reflects a poor quick cash grab on Daybreak's part. Even within their devblog updates, they fail to give any legitimate reason why they should sell 2 products for double the price and change nothing (aside from taking away Green Dawn). There are similar Battle Royale style games that are sold with plenty of other Survival games that are just as comparable, and don't encompass an entirety of a $20 purchase, but are instead an added feature or game mode, as this used to be. Get Rust or DayZ, which offer this and many other game modes, and what I would consider a more tight experience. As an alpha game, this is just dizzying and not worth the money, and it's not even a complete experience. Having already owned H1Z1, I still play it, and it's an enjoyable game, but it's not worth it, and a company that would try to pull something like this is not worth your cash.

They couldve simply kept it the way it is and improved on it. But instead they leave a under developed game and seperate it into 2 seperate games in order to Make it "better" for players. That was a poor decision daybreak. I would rather have the old H1Z1 that was already bad instead of having this 2 $20 games that shouldve only been $20 for both experiences of survival and battle royale.

Game mechanics have hardly changed since day one, items are being taken out of the game instead of being fixed because it's so buggy your pc would crash sometimes if you threw a molotov. I don't expect this game to survive long enough for it to even go into beta, since it has been alpha early access for more than a year now, and the only things that get added are items and cases so you'll spend more money outside of the €20 you spent on the original game.\n\nIt's actually very disappointing how bad the game is, because the idea is great and I still like to play it with friends, but the bugs, glitches and crashes really grinds my gears until the point where I don't want to play it anymore.\n\nI'm really hoping this game will crash and burn soon, as it deserves.","March 14","false","61.1"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","18","25","0","0"

With every "patch" they release more problems seem to occur as a result. Bump into a rock at idle speed in a vehicle with full health and it blows up, get shot in the chest with armor that doesn't get damaged, ridiculous drop shotting that they will never fix, terrible desyncing issues, jumping through walls on office buildings, roof exploits, hits that don't register. But they add a new reticle which wasn't necessary, change the fire rate of the AK, and a few other things that really didn't matter, very disappointing.

I guess it's modern standard?\n\n- Plenty of bugs and picking items is pain in the butt.\n\n- You shoot guy in the chest from close range twice. Then the person kills you with 2 pistol bullets and you die. Still has 100 health.\n\n- Your hardware dictate the game too much. By the time you land there is guy with big visa loan with shotgun at your face.\n\n- As i am editing this message, new match has been 10mins old and only handful of guns has spawned. Yes massive battle royale is going with fists.\n\n\nIt's not hopeless game, but requires rapid updating and fast. Plenty of bugs, cheaters and what else. Falling under world, no gun spawns, getting one tapped into bush from half the map away and what else stupid there is in store for players. Personally my best is sudden car explosions.\n\nI'll edit this to positive if they start updating the game and fixing all pesky bugs.

The best part of this game is playing with friends and when you get into groups of 5, you'll often find that 1 of you crashes upon starting up. This game has been out for a long time and they still haven't fixed it. There are plenty of other bugs too. A lot of the time my game will even crash while starting up.\n\nBut the real reason I'm writing this review is because they saw that their game became successful and decided to split it into 2 games charging the original $20 for each game totalling $40 now. HELL NO! WTH! You can't just up the price of a game like that! It's been out for at least a year and now you are doubling the price. Are you serious?! This was supposed to be a F2P game upon release and usually the longer games are out the less they cost, but you are one of the few companies to go the other way. Way to trash your companies name for some extra dough, which probably isn't even going to be that much. And the worst part is, your game is still just about as glitchy as when you started.","February 19","false","0.8"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"

The thing that I cant understand its we all know such a greedy - stingy company is DayBreak, But many people can't buy keys-cases because of the shift+TAB problem, But they are insisting to not solve this damn issue and let people have fun. Its annoying A.F. When people text me from steam, I cant answer without pressing ALT+TAB, I cant buy keys-cases in no way, when my friends invite me to lobby i need to ALT+TAB again.\n\nI bought this game approximetly 1 year ago, trying to fix it since last summer, spent around 6-7 hours to fix and haven't done a progress at all. I hope someone sees that, rather than seeing that, i hope they give a **** about that, cuz im really having fun with this game and my fun-meter would increase 150% if the steam overlay would display.","May 19","false","37.5"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","21","33","2","0"

The only reason it is still preorder is because they promised free on release. This game could be so much better, like in the trailer, if you could charge a guy with an axe and have a chance against a gun. I think a machete or axe takes less than 20 hits to kill someone. That should be the risk and reward charging a gun. Right now its all open areas dominated by shotguns and rifles (too common). They should make areas as if they are making a map for any other pvp game, or at least take out the endless forests you spend forever running through only to get killed and respawn right back in the middle.\n\nRight now the game looks like it could be great but these morons cant seem to stop focusing on making us buy skins.

Zombie survival and Battle Royale, now I would be 80% ok with this if this game was finished, well develop, well optimized, not broken piece of garbage, yes Battle Royale is fun, but it would be even better if it were not so broken and undeveloped. I hope devs go bankrupt because companies like this, money grabbing, garbage game making companies are cancer for gaming world.

They LIED about it going free to play, and then split their game in half, doubling the total price before it's even out of Alpha. This is not okay!\n\nThis change is nothing but a dirty cash grab. Daybreak as a company has a track record of failure and will do anything to try to get out of the red, and this is a prime example.\n\nThey haven't released a quality game in over 15 years. With all due respect to their employees and their livelihoods, this company should have been abolished years ago. It has been driven into the ground repeatedly by poor management, and compounded by lousy investments from both Sony and Columbus Nova.\n\nNo one talks about it, but there is no guarantee this game will even be available to play in months, let alone years. In 2014 Daybreak (then SOE) reportedly lost Sony $60 million, and now just one year after being sold off, this is the kind of gouging they're trying to pull on customers. Not enough red flags for you? They've had multiple huge layoffs over the years, at times completely devestating their customer support and quality assurance teams.","February 19","false","108.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Yep that's right. And not only two games, two $20.00 games. That's basically why it's not recommended.\n\nH1Z1 is a very fun survival game, my favorite being the Battle Royale gamemode, now known as "King of the Kill". The games have not changed one bit, still very fun, but for new players, this could be heartbreaking. A previously single $20.00 game is now split up into two games that you have to basically choose which one you want to buy/play instead of just choosing the gamemode. I think this idea of splitting the game was just a way of getting more money and basically scamming new players into buying two games for what once was a single game. Other than that, I recommend this game 100%. For now, i'll say Not Recommended.","February 26","false","9.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Why the bad review?\n\nWell, I'm not going to write the full story, I'll try to keep it short.\nMy first day of H1Z1: King of the Kill, my third match. We play in a team of 3, I'm just getting to learn the basics.\nOne of my teammates dies soon after we landed, the other one gets shot few minutes later when we were looting. I manage to kill the attacker and now I'm alone with more than 100 other players alive.\n\nSo I just hide inside a trailer and wait... and wait, lucky for me I am in a pretty good spot (G 6), gas wasn't coming in my area. At some point, when there were around 30 people left alive, I decide to leave my spot as gas was coming my way. I manage to kill 2 guys driving a car and follow my way up the hill.\n\nFast forward, there's 7 of us alive, I'm really excited to have gotten this far. I was on TeamSpeak with my teammates describing what's happening and asking for advice. The area without gas is becoming a tiny dot and forcing us to meet... Considering this was a match of up to 5 players teams, I decide to hide after some trees and wait for one of the (at least) 2 remaining teams to kill the other one so I could actually stand a chance.\n\nAnd then it happens... game closes, no error, no message, no nothing.

Basically, the game is still in alpha, they keep developing and adding more stuff but barely. It's the same game it was last year I'm assuming. If you want full details (and complaints) check out the Reddit community. It's ridiculous how much hate the developers get... But it makes sense.\n\nThis game could be so much better, it has so much potential. Even in its broken state I'll play and still have fun, but it's only in BR. Survival kinda seems like a waste, or at least a good way to practice your controls or setting up the game before you hop into BR.\n\nThe cosmetic items they have are kind of a joke because (in my opinion) they all look like absolute trash. Nothing is cool, they just make bright obnoxious ♥♥♥♥. They really need to change the way they deal with drops in this game (make keys available on steam).\n\nIs it fun every once in a while? Sure. Is it satisfying hardcore players that want this game to be... What it's supposed to be? Not at all, that's why everyone gives it bad ratings.\n\nI have a love/hate relationship with this game. The start of a new BR match is fun and exciting because you have to work with what you got, either it be a car and guns, or absolute ♥♥♥♥. It's interesting to see how the game plays out.\n\nHowever, people are correct in saying there are hackers, and flaws and numerous bugs. Considering how long it's been in development... You wonder what is actually going on.\n\nI'm giving it a thumbs down because it still needs work. And I'm done typing, just borrow it from a friend and see if you like it.","March 1","false","6.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Watch it on Twitch before you make a decision to purchase, certainly.\n\nYou get dropped into a big map and try to be the last person alive as you run toward the extraction point. The base mechnics and functionality of H1Z1 can be described charitably as "wonky" and uncharitably as "terrible." The shooting (specifically the weird recoil and bullet drop) is very questionable and not "smooth" in the style Call of Duty or Battlefield games(at least modern BF games-its hit detection often reminds me of BF2).This is the least acceptable a game can function while remaining moderately competitive. It IS competitive, partially because everyone is in the same wonky boat and partially because the only thing the Devs have focused on since the game's Twitch popularity exploded is percieved balance issues and squashing hackers (the number of hackers ~1 year ago was staggering). I very much wish there was some kind of rough "deathmatch" game type; you will likely die in 100 Battle Royales before getting used to the gunplay.\n\nAgain:Watch on Twitch before you buy. And even if you do buy, DON'T waste your money on the "Just Survive" game while it remains in early access. It's a bad, uninteresting DayZ clone with less variety.","February 22","false","7.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

This game is buggy, and it gets worse and worse.  Today I died by a vehicle in 1-man BR while I was parachuting in. I spawned in and fell to my death way up in the sky.  Another time I was standing in a kitchen tearing up clothes to make bandages, and I died.  The kill message said "better luck next time", normally it says who killed you and how much life they had.  I have died 3 out of 5 times due to bugs, and in Just Survive people can glitch invisible.\n\nNow before you say "it's in Alpha", this is where i say, I'm trying to prevent people from wasting their money on an unfinished game.  Wait until it is finished or comes out to beta, in probably 37 years.  There are plenty of other alternative games that are less buggy that you can play for a few years before this one is ready.\n\n\n\nDo your research before buying a game!!","May 26","false","3.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","9","14","2","0"

While the game was glitchy and a bit overpriced, I was happy to give support to a game that was trying to get some community help, and would eventually sell a FREE product. A couple of weeks ago, the game slpit into 2 parts, BR and Survival. I personally only played the survival once and I didn't really have that jolly of a time, and I primarily played BR. However, while I now own both parts of the game because I was grandfathered in and recieved both seperate games, I find it absolutely ridiculous and unfair for them to split into 2 games, charging consumers more for games that are buggy, terribly optimized, and in some cases unplayable. I believe that Daybreak has not hired any new developers, so what was the point of splitting the games into 2 if the same exact people are working on the 2 seperate parts? I would be a little bit more understanding if they hired 100 more developers and we got concrete evidence that there will be changes that benefit the performance of the game but so far that is not the case. This game made a HUGE MISTAKE breaking into 2 parts, and unless they recombine the two games, I do not recommend getting either version of the game. Hopefully Daybreak will learn their lesson and stop being greedy idiots who make a money grabbing game.","February 27","false","20.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

For people who bought the game back when it first came out you get both for free, while people who are just buying it must pay for both. The fact that this game is still in early access and they are doing this makes no sense. They also have microtransactions (which also shouldn't even be a thought) because the game has a load of bugs, the memory leak is the worst by far, the constant crashes dont help much either. Id say skip this game until the developers figure out where they are going with this game and decide to get it out of early access.","February 18","false","32.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

People are just lucky sometimes. Never seen any crazy ♥♥♥♥ like speed hacking, flying, no clipping or any of that stuff.\n\nGreedy devs / OMG cases before game is released / cry money grabbing cry: I actually like the fact the game has skins already. That being said, a person who creates skins does not have the same skill-set as someone who develops a new game mode. On top of that these crates/skins generate revenue for the company which would allow them to hire more developers which would allow them to fix more bugs and create more features. If you don't understand a game is a product of a company, and a company needs to make money, you're just a kid who's still living of their parents money.\n\nSure you'll run into something eventually that is bugged but remember it's still in early access.

I at least enjoyed playing it with friends and I had high hopes for the game back when it was still owned by SOE. The reason im giving this game a negative review is because H1Z1 was supposed to be F2P but instead of becoming F2P it literetly became 2x more expensive, and I don't understand why on earth they would do that, because they already earn enough money through the in-game store.\n\nI highly recommend that you do NOT buy this game, nor the other H1Z1 game. Instead, try Unturned. It's a free game, and it's updated almost weekly, there was a Battle Royale style gamemode added not too long ago called Arena and it's similar to H1Z1: KotH's Battle Royale.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/304930/","February 25","false","0.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Many of which are created within tight knit cheating communities and those that sell the cheats.\n\nPut hours into the game - only to have your wins taken by cheaters consistently.\n\nCurrently the development team has been unable to make any major progress in addressing the cheating that takes place. This is an "early release" game that has been in development for over 17 months.\n\nRecently this game employed BattleEye but it only catches hacks after the damage has been done. The obfuscation offsets are found within minutes to just a few hours after every update. There is a serious lack of authoritative server-client architecture due to, what 'seems' to be, a focus on performance & the amount of players a server can hold while lacking detail to security.\n\nLet's pretend cheating is not an issue. The game is awesome! Sadly that is not the case. This game would have serious potential if the development team took serious measures to maintain the integrity of their game and company.\n\n**NOTE: This review is subject to change if things take a different direction. For now, my input remains solid.","May 27","false","207.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

While The Culling is a fun game and it is impressive how optimized the game is in its early stages it does not compare to KOK. KOK has a more real life feel and the game takes skill to win and strategy not just pressing three buttons in The Culling. I will admit the optimization is annoying given how long H1Z1 has been out and it still encounters lagging and consistency issues. But as far as KOK it is the most replayable game mode I have ever played by yourself or with your buddies.

You're supposed to scavenge from place to place, never let your guard down and keep your head down.\nYou can play with yourself, a friend or 4 friends (0, 1 and 4 friends, not 0 to 4) but that's on seperate servers, there's also a zombie server because, zombies.\n\nThe game runs really smooth, i haven't gotten any issues whatsoever, and I really recommend this game.\n\n(Please note that there is bugs and the game is in alpha)","March 6","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Dev team. Yeah sure, they work on the game. But they also break other things when they fix one thing. Like they don't fully test updates before launching. Also, with playing on US servers, there are a lot of people from other countries which results in lag on their  end, which causes desync so you may  be behind an object on your screen but not on theirs. This could be solved by a simple Ping Cap. Overall, it is a good game for Casual play.","May 21","true","426.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While The Culling is a fun game and it is impressive how optimized the game is in its early stages it does not compare to KOK. KOK has a more real life feel and the game takes skill to win and strategy not just pressing three buttons in The Culling. I will admit the optimization is annoying given how long H1Z1 has been out and it still encounters lagging and consistency issues. But as far as KOK it is the most replayable game mode I have ever played by yourself or with your buddies. Once they fix the other issues, I'm assuming pretty quickly by the release date, it will be 10/10.","March 13","true","95.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Who in their right mind would recommend this 'game' to people who are willing to pay 20 bucks for this piece of crap. This isn't a game, it's literally a list of 12 servers. A 'regular' aka 'solo' Battle Royale which is full of people teaming together, a '2-team' which is full of teams teaming together, a '5-team' which isn't worth playing if you don't have a group of 4 thrustworthy other people via Skype or TeamSpeak, randoms will shoot you in the back so if you're willing to play this but can't find 4 other thrustworthy people it's recommended to kill all randoms in your team as soon as possible before they kill you and your friend(s). And a 'zombie' Battle Royale which used to call 'hardcore' but except zombies there was literally nothing 'hardcore' about this mode hence the new name, the only good decision they made. You have US/EU/AU servers for all 4 modes. AU is always low-populated because the lagg. EU/US are the both lagg-free but before the 'split' I never had to be in a queu for longer than one minute and now it's always 5 to 10 minutes.\n\nWhen you're finally done with queuing and you load in to the 'pre-lobby' it's full of screaming kids so make sure you use your 'mute-all-button'. It's like a mix of Africa and Asia out there so be prepared. "HALLAHU AKBAR. CHINA NUMBHA ONE. I BANGED YOUR MOM LAST NIGHT. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. KILL ALL THE BLACKS. HUEAAAAHWUEHA." Oh, and there's always that one kid in the middle playing dubstep or some other crappy music. So the first thing I do when I spawn is mute everything. Highly recommended.\n\nSo that's it. No singleplayer, no private sessions but maybe the reason why I wouldn't recommend this game is you won't have fun. Maybe if they actually made it F2P like they promised I would say download it, install it and check it yourself but please don't waste 20 bucks on this game.","February 21","false","284.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Achei que cometeram uma injustiça, e por isso quando for comprar esse jogo fique atento, pois pode ter bugs assim que eles se recusam a resolver, um deles é possivelmente não aparecer um item no seu inventário, onde pode custar algum dinheiro e você perder ele e ter que passar por uma burocracia para receber de volta, se receber....\n\n\nI love the game, but expect many bugs , one was the injustice that happened in wipe separation .

The skins do not change the game in anyway, only cosmetics. The gameplay is great but there a times when i feel i was killed by a cheater, gun fights dont feel consistant which really makes you rage, or just me.\nLoved this game before split and still now, dont buy it because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ micro transactions, they dont matter, if your that botherded about skins go on the marketplace and buy some like i have.

Then there is the "jumping while using shotgun technique" it causes the server to take a ♥♥♥♥ and all sorts of randomness occurs, shots going straight through the target, random damage (just played a game where I lost a 1 on 1 with a target who had no armour and I had armour, full health and a med pack ticking away,  we both hit each other, he 1 shotted me and I did 46% damage to him)\n\nIt seems clear to me that this game will never leave alpha, bugs still persist and yet the devs carry on pumping out new crates.  We as consumers need to let the industry know its ok to release games early to gain the ability to test on a bigger stage but it isnt ok to charge ppl for the game, carry on making new revenue streams and actually not bring the game forward to a release.

The reviews are mostly by people who don't even play King of the Kill, it's almost all Survival players who are for some reason salty that they split the games. Survival players are mad because splitting the games took away a large portion of their player base but if you're like me and think survial is stupid then it doesn't matter that the games were split.\n\nThis game is extremely fun and addictive but not very rewarding. People these days are so caught up on progression and rewards for games that they don't realize that they aren't even having fun. If you just play for the sake of playing then you will probably enjoy this game. If you sit an wonder why they haven't added a progression profile or why they always are releasing new crates you're focusing on the wrong things. This game wouldn't really be that much better with all the fancy ♥♥♥♥ that comes standard with most games. Look at 90% of the reviews and realize they are almost all under 5 hours of gameplay.\n\nGameplay\nKotk is a streamlined survival game without all the time consuming fluff  (such as building or crafting). This game is focused more around tactical gun battles and the gameplay is very intutive. It's insanely fun and easily the best survival looting game out there. I've played Just Survive, DayZ, Arc, and RUST but none of those games come close to as fun as Kotk. Are there bugs? Tons. Are there hackers? Tons. Are the developers absolute money grubbing shipbags? 100%. Does that take away from the pure enjoyment I get from this game? Absolutely not.\n\n\nWAHHHH THEY SPLIT THE GAMES WAAAAH\nGuess what? Just Survive and KotK needed to be split. It was absolutely essential to the health of both games. Now they can balance the games seperately and it will work out better for everyone. They needed two seperate teams to develope the games, and while I can't speak about JS's progress I can honestly say that Kotk has gotten better since the split. The team is more focused on makeing the changes that need to happen. At the end of the day people who play Just Survive are total crybabies becuase they know that more people play KotK and they spent 200 hours building their base for nobody to give a ♥♥♥♥. KotK is just more fun, end. of. story.\n\n\nI'm not going to tell you that this game is perfect or that the developers are good people but at the end of the day it doesn't matter to me. I enjoy this game greatly in its current state and that why I play video games, to have fun and enjoy myself. You might enjoy this game too if you are willing to put the time into understanding it rather than just blindly bashing it because it's Early Access and they split the game. You might even learn a little Chinese on the way.\n","May 13","true","309.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

You cant aim properly because something is \"off\" in this game. You have to reduce your sensibility to max and add command lines in the config file if you want to have a chance to actually aim at something and even if you manage that, the time itll take you to actually click and shoot, you will already be shot thrice in the head by the flashy spendex geared dude that put 1000 hours in the initial release of the game.\n\nBy the way, this ♥♥♥♥ game is only half of what it was at first for a pricetag of 22$ CAN when it was actually supposed to be free and include the survival mode. The free skins/clothes you get by being in the top 10 are always the same unless you pay to get a key to unlock crates. That you finish 10th or 1st, youll get the same ♥♥♥♥ t-shirt or ugly ♥♥♥ goggles every single time. Youll have to equip those unlocks after every single match.\n\nAt the start of the match, noone actually starts dropping in their chute at the same time. By that I mean that the guy with a 2000$ rig, whos loads faster the map than the other guy with his 500$ rig will actually appear first on the map, therefor drop to his chosen spot first and so will have his gun and gear before you even touched the ground. There is no countdown so that at least 90% of the players are finished loading like -any- god damn online competitive game out there. That also means that if you have the slow computer of your group of friends, they too will be first to drop in the parachute and you might lose them.\n\nCars physics are ♥♥♥♥, hitting the smallest bump makes your car fly and doing flips. That is if it actually works because even that isnt sure. The game emphasizes on some kind of realism, where you bleed from wounds, mostly die from a headshot and in survival mode, there is stamina, hunger etcetc ...yet, you can totally have a group of 5 enter a car, drive right next to another group, all hit the \"e\" to exit all at once with the car going forward alone for a while and the group of 5 just pop outside the car  and blast those poor sods.\n\nThe hub is a buggy mess. You actually need to invite people through -Steam- so they can join your group, its not even ingame. That has you hit \"shift-tab\" to get to your Steam overlay to accept the invite. The catch of that is that when you enter the game after that, youll have a bug that makes your map and inventory unavailable unless you mess with the \"shift-tab\" a few times until it stops bugging.\n\nThis game is only bareable when you play with friends but even this gets to you after a while. If youre 5 and you die alone, there is no spectator mode, you cant navigate the map to see what happens around, you cant follow one of your friends. You just sit there or log out and start a match on your own. If your friends play to win and not to mess around, then the match will prolly take 30-40 minutes with them hidding in bushes and such. Oh and I almost forgot, either you have one friend ...or 4 ...because you cannot make a group of 3 or 4. You are either solo, duo or 5. That is it!\n\nLast thing, edited after uninstalling the game. Even the uninstall part is ♥♥♥♥ as the game leaves for about 6.5 gig of useless files on your computer.\n\nI honestly suggest to stay away from this game and NOT give money to those devs. Every bad reviews say so and sadly I didnt listen to them.","May 31","false","22.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The community is garbage and most people run around the pre game lobby screaming at the top of their lungs or shouting "China number one". It's also infested with twitch streamers which I personally detest.\nIf you want to play a good battle royale game, buy the Culling instead. It's cheaper, and is much, much better. Daybreak is by far one of the worst developers in the history of video games.\n","March 16","false","6.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"
