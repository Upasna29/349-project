I really do enjoy a game that feels a little different each time you play, and this game does give me that feeling. What you're getting in this game is a visit from the retro arcade shoot em' ups from yore... then mixed with a little dash of "weird". :P\n\nGameplay wise, its Galaxian with a jumping ability. This jump allows you to dodge enemies at the bottom of the screen as well as dive out the way of all the incoming ships/aliens/bullet/meteors/tetrominoes and anything else that attacks/falls from the sky. Power ups are plentiful, each with a rapid/power mode. Collect crackers to extend the power-ups lifetime as well as rack up points to unlock more in-game oddities... basketballs, anyone?\n\nVisuals and sound are equally as pleasing and overall comes off as anything but bland. Definetly not one for people who want realism - which I appreciate. The presentation and humor are also a welcome gift.\n\nSo, If you like retro-shooters and also weird humor, with bright cartoony visuals - pick it up, you can't go wrong. :)\n","March 24, 2015","true","2.2"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","22","27","5","0"

I love how you don't even have to press the fire button. The game auto fires for you. All you have to do is move and jump. The devs clearly knew what they were doing, because in any normal shmup, there's never a reason to take your thumb off the fire button.\n\nLottsa power ups, random events like falling exploding basketballs, delightfully retro sound effects, and a good sense of progression through collecting crackers that unlock new stuff that shows up in the game. And while the sense of humor isn't particularly smart, it does the job of taking me back to the days of playing stupid Nickelodian flash games on their website.\n\nThe only part of this game that is reminiscent of Galaga is the enemy formations. That's about it. For the asking price, I'd say this is well worth it for a relaxing good time.","November 21, 2015","true","4.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Instead of fixed levels, the games randomizes the successive waves of aliens as well as various other elements such as the ground you stand on or side challenges handed over by a pair of bossy sisters.\n\nEnemies drop power-ups as expected and they are sorely needed as your default laser is slow and weak. The rare moments when you're stuck with your default with no upgrades in sight feel a bit underwhelming.\n\nThe game controls fine though the jumping lacks a bit in response and precision, IMO. My only gripe is that using a 360 controller the d-pad is set to jump and left/right movement, which would be fine except for the 360 pad being so imprecise, so you must use the left or right analogue stick to move.\n\nIt takes about 30 minutes of gameplay to unlock enough rewards to have the game really pick up the pace. Stick with it for a while if the first couple of minutes feel a bit slow and light on thrills.\n\nSo power up with pizza, fire up your Flarf Gun and don't pet the Astro Kitties!","March 25, 2015","true","9.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/341120/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Based on a graphic novel: The game is based upon James Kolchaka’s graphic novel ‘The Glorkian Warrior Delivers a Pizza.’ Kolchaka is the first resident of Vermont, a state in the New England region of the United States, to win the Laureate for best cartoonist. He is a prolific artist in the world of comics having written and illustrated for MARVEL with his ‘Hulk Vs. The Rain‘ short that was originally published in black and white in an unauthorized alternative magazine, he is the creator of ‘Monkey Vs. Robot’ and ‘Impy and Wormer’ which was featured in Nickelodeon Magazine. In 2012 he won the Eisner Award for Dragon Puncher 2: Dragon Puncher Island. Kolchaka is a very talented man with his talents spreading across multiple forms of the entertainment industry. He is also a rock musician fronting his own band, James Kolchaka Superstar, who have released nine albums. His artistry in the game is outstanding – everything looks precisely the way that you would want it to and is very easy on the eyes. It adds a tremendous amount of character to the game. It’s some of the best art work that I’ve seen in this genre of indie gaming.\n\nChallenging play: Glorkian Warrior offers some of the most challenging game play that I’ve come across in some time. The mixture of Galaga-style shoot-em-up with platformer style gameplay works marvelously well. Deaths and hits generally always feel fair to me which is of vital importance. However,  I do take issue when the game expects you to jump and then has enemies flying down at you that are unavoidable. This is the only let down in what is a vitally important component.  Game play consists of constantly moving around the bottom of the screen while shooting – automatically – at enemies above and avoiding traps that are next to you constantly trying to kill you. The amount of power ups and their variety is one of the game’s key strengths.\n\nSuitable for all ages: As the original title was intended for a younger audience the game is definitely accessible to younger players if you don’t mind them blasting space ships out of the sky. Although I do not have any children of my own I do feel that I am very education conscious. There is nothing here stopping children from playing the game. In fact, some of the video games that I played in my early education in school would have been much more of a concern than this. It’s animated violence and children would see much more violent things in their cartoons.\n\nGood humor: What I loved perhaps most of all in Glorkian Warrior was the use of comedy. Again, it is something that all ages and audiences can appreciate but adults should not find too young. There’s a lot to like in the way that the story is told that will engage older gamers. It is good humor that will have you laughing when you’re not too busy concentrating on advancing further into the game.\n\nSuper Addictive: Glorkian Warrior is the very definition of a ‘one more turn’ game for me. This is accomplished through the superb unlock system in the game.  Every time you unlock something the next unlock feels as though its only a game or two away until you advance deep into the mid and latter parts of the game and only then does it begin to take considerable effort to get to the next unlock. Of course, by then, Pixeljam hope that you have improved sufficiently that the next unlock still doesn’t feel that far away. Unlocks include new power ups, birthday cakes, basketballs, ceramic cats – that the developer owns – and actual short comics that are a pleasure to read.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed Glorkian Warrior – Trial of the Glork. It’s a perfectly addictive retro-style shoot’em up cross platformer that will keep you playing. I would recommend it to everyone and in my opinion is Pixeljam’s best game to date.\n\nFor similar reviews and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 27","true","6.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

You are in control of the alien Glork, and you are protecting your asteroid from invading aliens. The game play is simple. Run around and shoot the aliens. You find that you are shooting constantly and bare no control over that, all you have to do is move around the level avoiding the rockets, rocks or whatever else the aliens shoot at you.\n\nThere is a nice unlock system where if you complete certain challenges or hit point barriers, you unlock different weapons. The different weapons can be picked up in game. These weapons can then be upgraded with various different effects, such as twisty lasers, rapid fire, or extra damage, some times you if you mix the right weapon with the right laser, you get a seriously over powered load out and just rip through everything.\n\nI really like the cute sound effects on show here,  the voices sound hilarious, and I love the characters Chloe, and Chloe. I loved the back and forth between the characters.\n\nOn a whole, while this isn't the sort of game that will have you sitting down for hours upon hours a session, it does offer something different, short bursts of fun which is sometimes all you need just to relax and take your mind off life.\n\nWould certainly recommend Glorkian Warrior!\n\nFind more reviews at - http://www.completingthebackloggroup.com/","April 21, 2015","true","2.0"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","19","35","4","0"

The aliens fly out in Galaga-esque flight patterns, taking place in the sky with a playing field that spans approx 2 screens wide making it somewhat unique.\n\nBlowing up aliens quickly earns you more perks -- double lasers, fireballs, glorf gun, and such -- and also causes the aliens to drop "crackers" which you collect.

Galaga has been my favorite game since an Atari controller hit my hand in 1988, and I've gotta say- 'Glorkian Warrior' is the only game since then in the genre that I've had nearly as much fun with. This game is *that good*.\n\nIt's been years since a game made me WANT to get better at it (and I have, I actually have the #2 score on the Ace difficulty leaderboard right now, though I'm sure that will change).\n\nNegatives: Pretty shallow menu, to view global leaderboards it has to launch an external window. It's a bit unclear what causes the different events and levels, every game can feel vastly different than the last (which is also a positive, it would just be nice to know why/when some of the things happen)\n\nHIGHLY recommended.

Music is great and its dorky cartoony visuals are something to look forward to!\n\nI give it a 8/10 for its excellence as a game of its genre\n\nCheck out my silly video of the game as well!\nhttps://youtu.be/Y0NMhlZvsUo","October 10, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The look of it, the sound of it. It makes you wanna get better and better. Lot's of Kochalkian humor baked-in. The unlocks are priceless. I can't believe it's only $3.99.

That retro, goofy sci-fi of Spaceman Spiff, Commander Keen, and Buck Rodgers kinda schtick.  It's silly and cute and if those two words just made you throw up a little, then this ain't the game for you.\n\nAs to the gameplay, it most closely resembles Galaga or Space Invaders.  Enemies fly out in patterns and attempt to shoot you and/or fly into you.  The formula is broken up a bit by little blobs known as "Spitters" coming along the ground from off-screen requiring you to jump on or over them.  Also, the odd meteor/Tetris piece shower happens and the meteors can be broken into smaller pieces by shooting them, which felt somewhat like it was inspired by the Buster Bros/Pang series of games.\n\nAs you play you collect crackers.  Yes.  Crackers.  Which are apparently the choice intergalactic currency.  Crackers will slightly refill your power-up meter and will also serve to unlock additional weapons, terrain, enemies, and other assorted goodies as you play, die, and play again.  This adds to the replay value of an otherwise pretty simple and straightforward game.  The controls are pretty tight and definitely don't work against you.  Firing your weapon is automatic and saves you from the pain of thumb-blisters.\n\nThere is a decent variety of weapons, some standard (such as a triple laser) and some goofy (such as tennis balls) but only half of them really stand out as especially useful - though anything is better than the default pea-shooter.  There are also two secondary power-ups, rapid fire and power.  The first being self-explanatory and the second simply adding more damage and increasing projectile size.  Having both power-ups active at once makes every weapon ten times better, even the default.  All weapons and power-ups are time-limited, with the exception that weapons can have their time extended by collecting crackers.\n\nDespite the kid-friendly graphics and humor, the game can be rather hard and unfair, sometimes just literally carpet bombing you with an impossible to dodge barrage of enemies and projectiles.  Often the jumping aspect becomes an annoyance because you bonk your head into the flurry of enemies.  You can often die because when it gets hectic it becomes very hard to discern between what is a cracker, a power-up, one of your projectiles, or one of the enemies.  Particularly when enemy projectiles often have the same colors as yours.  It also doesn't offer much in the way of long term replay value.  It nails the basics well enough, however, that it's one of those games you can come back to every so often to enjoyable kill some time.\n\nDon your sentient robot backpack and head out on patrol if you...\n\nLove corny and zany sci-fi.  Glorkian Warrior isn't a laugh riot per se, but it's definitely endearing.\nLove classic arcade shooters.  The basics are all in place here and it plays very well.\nAre looking for a good value.  For the price of a fast-food meal, this game is a definite bargain.\n\nOrder a pizza instead if you...\n\nHate cartoony, silly things.  That's half of the appeal here.\nAre looking for deep mechanics or something to sink a lot of time into.  This is definitely short and sweet.\nGot your feelings hurt by Zoe and Chloe.\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIt was cute, it was fun, and I find that I like to play it here and there to kill some time.  You can unlock everything pretty quickly though, and you're likely going to see everything the game has to offer within the span of an hour or two.\n\nI loved the Glorkian Warrior himself.  He reminds me of a character Matt Groening (of Simpsons/Futurama fame) might have created in his early days.  In fact, there are a couple mini-comics available to unlock in this game.  The antagonistic Spitter sisters, Zoe and Chloe were also kind of amusing, although I was hoping that they could have been the basis of a power-up where they come out and smash things in their battle suits.  As far as actual laughs though, it was the Magic Robot, the kinda-sorta villain of the game, that I loved the most.  A giant robot head that just inexplicably appears to loudly proclaim some bizarre assertion, and turn things into cakes or bounce across the screen.  You never actually get to fight him though and he unfortunately has no role other than a random encounter.\n\nThe game is definitely worth the measly $3.99 asking price, but I also often seen it in sales and bundles where it is an even bigger bargain.  I love Pixeljam in general and I'd think it would be awesome to see a sequel to Glorkian Warrior in the form of a mixed shooter/platformer,  PixelJam, however, tends to focus on creating well-made but short gameplay experiences and a diverse array of titles rather than spending too much time revisiting things they've already done.\n\nAll things considered, playing this game is funner than getting a flurmpwock to the elbow.
