There are a handful of maps to play on, each simple and clean. My favorite is the one where you are shrunk down playing on a giant table, using huge books and cups as cover.\n\nThe movement works well, throw a potion with your non dominate hand to teleport there. Your other hand has a wand that fires and shows your score. Its a lot of fun to dodge your opponents fire by pacing back and forth, and then throwing your potion behind them to surprise them.\n\nI recommend buying a second code to give to a friend so you will have someone else to play with, As it is currently only multiplayer. Ive played a couple times with other twitch streamers and had a blast.","April 11","true","6.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

We played this for about 2 hours in a row blasting the hell out of each other and it was awesome! for the sake of a few quid it is definately worth it, also the developers are responsive and making fixes and expansions on existing game play! well worth it :)","April 12","true","1.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Needs steamworks support or there will be no players simple as that. When the only gamemode is multiplayer the multiplayer needs to be done well.","June 5","false","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

My left controller becomes a wand, my right controller a hand. which vibrates pulsating and blinks. There's a text on the wall about the recent chagnes I think. On the left is more text and a few buttons, one for the tutorial. The text is out of my reach, cannot walk the distance and I have no clue how to teleport, but i can target the tutorial button with my hand and click. End up in a room with a large counter and some text that this tutorial is only temporary. I still have no clue what to do. I cannot do anything nor can I go back to the start.. So I close the program.","May 29","false","0.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

There's too little content to justify the current price of $10.99. The dev seems active on the project, so there could very well be a lot more girth to the game in the future, but again it feels extremely Early Access at this point.\n\nOne issue I have is the requirement to forward ports to host a game, especially since the userbase is so small right now. When I've played, there were no games running. This meant I forward ports so my friends and I have a sever to play on, or we can't play the game. While not hard to do, I'm not setting dedicated IPs and forwarding ports for a game. Steamworks should be implemented in a multiplayer only game (currently only multiplayer), or in the least a dev server should be running 24/7.\n\nAll that said, the Dev seems to be working towards these goals. So as long as you're ok jumping on the bandwagon really early, and you're ok setting your network up to play, this might be your kind of game. It currently feels a little underdevelped and too price heavy for me, however.","April 24","false","0.8"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","9","20","0","1"

Both me and a friend tried playing together and it was just impossible. The design looks great, but this game is just a $11 menu screen. Probably the last early access VR game I buy thanks to this monstrosity.","June 5","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
