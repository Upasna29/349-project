"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Adurnas/recommended/236850/","Adurnas","Adurnas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Adurnas/","163 products in account","A rather complex grand strategy game, you pick a country to control starting from the year 1444 all the way to 1821. There isn't any fixed objective to aim for: it's  a good idea to try to get the achievements offered (such as world domination), as most are a real challenge to earn.\n\nEach country is divided into provinces, allowing movement of you armies from one to another in real time - nothing here is turn based. Battles aren't controlled by you, as in total war: you make your army walk onto the same province as an opposing army, and the battle outcome is decided in part by random dice rolls, and in part by factors you can influence, such as generals, terrain, morale of troops. The same can be said for naval battles, where different types of ships behave differently depending on what sea province you are fighting in, if they are in the open ocean, or in a closed sea (such as the Mediterranean).\n\nDiplomacy is fairly well fleshed out, countries can have a number of different governments, such as feudal monarchies or merchant republics, all that give different bonuses and maluses, and some (such as republics) offer the possibility to choose what type of leader you want, so as to give you more of a certain type of monarch points. You can offer alliances, royal marriages, support rebels, create false claims on provinces you don't own to give you a "casus belli" (a reason to go to war) among other things, the list is really really huge.\n\nMonarch points are a "limiting factor" in the game, you have 3 different types of monarch points (Administrative, Diplomatic, Military), each that serve different purposes. For example, military points can be spent to buy a new general, or to treat a province harshly if rebels are likely to rise up there. (As of the Art of War update, rebel mechanics have changes slightly. Instead of each province possibly spawning rebels depending on a percentage, now each rebel faction has a counter that goes up or down depending on your country's stability and province modifiers, such as nationalism, culture or religion. Once the counter reaches 100%, multiple stacks of rebels spawn). Other points can be used to change your capital, annex vassals, gain provinces in peace deals, create buildings and much more. The gain of monarch points depend on your ruler, that can give from 0 points each to 6 point each month. By spending some of your income, you can also hire advisors, that can add to your monthly monarch points income, and grant you some nationwide bonuses.\n\nTrade is also a large factor in the game, you have merchants and you can choose to send them to various trade nodes, and you can choose if you want them to try and collect money from that node with a malus, or to send the money that you collect upstream, to a different node where you can collect from. Having colonies and trade agreements with other countries helps your trade income, while being embargoed reduces your trade in nodes that the country embargoing you controls.\n\nAs of the "Common Sense" update eu4 has a revamped fortress mechanic, given out for free. Now fortresses are placed in various provinces in your country (you can also choose to build them once you have the money), and they exert a "zone of control". Provinces without forts on them are very easy to conquer while in war, while provinces with fortresses on them have to be seiged or assaulted to fall under the attackers control. Forts now block enemy units from advancing, allowing the defending nation to have some space to reorganize and prepare defences, while the attacking nation has to carefully choose how and where to attack so as to lose the least amount of troops. Unoccupied forts also have a "zone of control": If you conquer a province next to a fort, but leave the fort to itself, the fort will free any occupied neighbouring province while at war. I love these changes, especially if you play a large nation, as it adds a whole extra layer of strategy to how you build up you nation's provinces.\n\nParadox has created a lot of DLC for this game, but with each DLC comes a vast amount of free content as well, so it might be advisable to buy the base game before buying DLC, so as to see what you think about the game before commiting too much. If you choose to play online with a friend that owns the DLCs, even without owining the DLCs yourself, the game activates them, so its possible to try them out before you buy. It would also be a good idea to try and watch a tutorial beforehand (Arumba on youtube comes to mind), as the game doesn't do a great job of explaining all it has to offer.\n\nIt's a very time-consuming, and occasionaly frustrating game, but I found that the more I played it, the more I enjoyed it: I'm constantly learning new things I can use to my adantage, and the game is becoming more satisfying due to that.","October 5, 2014","true","142.7"," 833 of 852 people (98%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","98","833","852","20","3"

But thanks to the fine people at Paradox Interactive, I can unleash the inner beast that resides within all white European christians and do my part for humanity. Once I get bored from ousting the filthy Turkomans from Constantinople (not giving it back to Byzantium because ♥♥♥♥ orthodoxy Pope #1 forever get rekt bearded priests) I can turn my furious and just gaze across the atlantic and kill lots of savages (not my fault those filthy natives were living on Burgundian Florida). Soon the whole world will be swathed in burgundian colors, or all thats actually worth ruling (not ruling africa because africa and lots of zulu rebellions plus mosquitos).\n\nThis game is best played with a warm cup of Folger's coffee in your hands, so you can actually smell the oppression while you relive the greatest period of time of all time. The period when white people discovered the world, and decided they didnt like it.","March 15, 2014","true","654.9"," 3,521 of 3,800 people (93%) found this review helpful 92 people found this review funny","93","521","3","92","112"

Of course there are plenty of mods to extend the gameplay for Civilization, but a new game, where everything is new, is fresh and exciting.\nSo let’s shall begin with topics I want to "review".\n\nMusic\nMost of the times are peaceful songs whistling in the background, but the music dynamically changes when going to war with another country, which is trying to boost the morale of the player, which usually works. The weird part about the peaceful songs are, that they are somewhat forgettable, but will stick to your head so that you may find yourself whistling a tune of a melody a week later.\n\nDLC’s\nThere are many... Way too many DLC's that did come out for this game.\nLuckily they are usually units getting a better design, for 2€ each so you are not missing out on too much. The ones which are more expensive have definitely more going on. For example the "new" DLC "Conquest of Paradise" enhances the colonization mechanics which were, at the beginning of the game, a bit lackluster, but more on that later.\n\nCountries\nThe country’s themselves are from the year 1444 to 1821, the interesting part about them is, that you are absolutely free to choose which date you are going to start, that means you can play against revolutionary French as Austria or play as Portugal to colonize the new world.\n\nAI\nThe AI has a certain points of intelligence made out of preference, there are militaristic, diplomatic, passive and colonizing leaders for each country with their accurate ruler of that time. That is, until you start playing and the heirs will be completely different than actual history of course. The human player gets treated just like an AI to other AI's, if you conquer they will hate you, if you don't have any alliances they are going to attack you, that's why there's that certain point of risk of alliances with the AI, which can make your AI ally to an enemy faster than you might think. Just never trust them too much...\n\nIdeas\nThe idea system is a way to put more of your own preference into the country that you are playing, there are currently 71 unique idea groups for specific country’s, 18 group ideas for country regions (like Italy) and 8 possible slots for your own idea groups to choose which consist of another 7 ideas. That sounds like a lot, and it certainly was a pain for the creators, but it was well worth it. It gives most of the countries just their own specialty. But I'm not going to go into that sort of stuff.\n\nColonization\nThe new made colonization concept is a simple but innovative one. Get exploration ideas, Colonize more than 5 provinces in a certain region and a colonial vassal gets created. The colonial vassal is just like another country, but he has to pay taxes and can't attack you. You can control these taxes on your own, but never set these taxations too high, because you know what happened with the USA and Great Britain at that time. Independence wars definitely can get a strain on you, if you know that you have to travel across the Atlantic Ocean to fight a war.\n\n\nThere are certainly way more things I could try talking about, but I just want to bore the casuals and try to keep the strategic fans interested, especially the fighting mechanics and monarch points, but I don't want to tell you everything. There is that certain interest I wanted to awake in some people, so that they are going to try this game for themselves, and not get ultimately bored because I just told them everything of the game.\nFor most of the people the Price is going to be the main issue with this game, 40€ certainly is quite a lot in the steam shop, but that's why special sales exist. If it's getting 50% off I can definitely recommend it.\nThe game managed to keep my interest for other 265 Hours now, and hasn't even bored me a bit so far.\nIt's probably a game what you are going to get in touch and love it, or try it and hate it.\nI hope I managed to get some peoples interest, and if you are still reading this, thanks for reading my first proper review. It means quite a lot to me.\nMfG Artjom\n","March 8, 2014","true","730.3"," 521 of 532 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","521","532","0","6"

The spells you cast draw on three mana pools: Paper Mana, Bird Mana, and Sword Mana.  Bird mana is used to make peace deals, genocide cultures, and stop your people from whining about war weariness.  Paper mana, in combination with a gold sacrifice, can be used to cast construction spells, in addition to making a province you gained two years ago a core part of your nation somehow.  Sword mana is used for enchanting rebel factions to keep them in line.  You generate mana for these pools by sucking the life essence from your monarch and his cabinet of advisors.  Be careful, though, as the ones that generate the most mana tend to die rather quickly.  You'll frequently see your 6/4/5 monarch die by age 30.\n\nYou'll notice that most of the spells are involved with either war or keeping your people from whining about war.  Don't worry, that's by design.  There's nothing to do if you aren't at war.\n\n10/10 it's okay","November 5, 2014","true","517.8"," 879 of 986 people (89%) found this review helpful 647 people found this review funny","89","879","986","647","7"

I've been playing it for... I don't know how long, a few weeks. From the time I wake up until the time I go to sleep, eating between wars, literally dreaming about my kingdom and after about 200 hours playing I haven't got tired of it yet.\n\nBut perhaps you'd like to hear a story. Maybe a tale of woe, of blood and vengeance...\n\nAustria, 1653. IronMan mode.\n\nMy King was yet another re*ard in a long line of mentally challenged Habsburgs. Administration was difficult, for he didn't know how to count from 0 to 10 by the age of 46. Pen and paper were alien artifacts for this man, who considered burping after a meal with international envoys a diplomatic act. I was proud once, when I learned he loved guns. And forever ashamed when I found out he couldn't fathom how to work a trigger. He became a General as soon as he turned 15 and then, for the first time, he was good at something... no, I'm  kidding, he was terrible. I'm sure his kind mother put that one star over his head. She didn't fool anyone. Well... no one but the king himself, of course... silly kid...\n\nSo, as a good christian overlord, I was patient-- and spent 30 years trying to kill him, spearheading the "special" monarch into the most challenging battles. Soon I started to fear he had been blessed with immortality to compensate for his almighty uselessness. The damned French on my western border had a 6/4/6 sadist on their throne. My neighbor's lawn was greener than mine. I was desperate.\n\nHence came the time when I, the Holy Roman Emperor, accidentally enacted a cursed reform that wouldn't allow me to wage war against the Empire's members anymore, bringing my struggle towards unifying the HRE almost to a halt. But I had hope in my heart, for if no tragedy happened and I managed to keep peace, the 170 years left to play should be enough for me to gather 150 Imperial Autorithy points to fulfill my objective. I had 3 provinces left under foreign rule waiting for the taking and that should guarantee my success-- so I demanded what was rightfully mine.\n\nI went to war against my oldest friend and ally, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Again. They were so scared that even with their half-russian-size territory they didn't put up a fight-- literally not one, while I went on rampaging through their territory. I needed one more point for them to accept my peace offer and return the Empire's provinces when it happened...\n\nThey sent forth a 62 regiments army against me, a 3 star general leading it. They didn't stand a chance against my 130 invading regiments, of course, which was about half my army at that time. But they were brave, and chose to forfeit their lives for the sake of their homeland. So a massive battle began-- and it unraveled quickly. The fight went on for less than a month when... my f****** s** of a b**** piece of s*** excuse for a King died in it. Yeah, sure, I was euphoric for a moment. But no, it turns out those weren't good news because...\n\nWith his demise I lost the elections to be the next Emperor-- for the first time, mind you-- so I didn't get the 10 Imperial Authority bonus. A few days (or seconds) later, after the previously mentioned battle was won and so was the war, the Empire's territories were proudly returned by me. And then I learned you can only gain Authority if you are the current Emperor. The new guy at the office, the Holy chairman of the ancient Roman Empire, the 15 year old King of a useless single-province kingdom, laughed at me. I felt it, I swear. I'll remember that moment until the day I die... possibly even longer than that...\n\nSo after about 10 minutes screaming at my computer and one more hour cursing inside my head, I recovered my sanity once again, kept it cool, and decided to wipe the Holy Roman Empire from the face of the Earth. I'm halfway there, but the more than a million rebel soldiers spawning everywhere across my kingdom are delaying my war efforts. Still, I shall have my vengeance.\n\nSorry, I had to put that out there. A 15 year old Saxe-Lauenburgian kid as the Holy Emperor... what a joke. I'll give him his first shave with a flying cannonball.\n\nEDIT:\n\nWith inhuman effort and, of course, the help of God himself (thank you, Pope) I reverted my situation and finally managed to unify the HRE. Now, in 1753, from the edges of a long-gone Hungary to the borders of Spain, Europe is under my rule.\n\nBut you wonder: "Why does that matter?" And I tell you: because it means if I had been born in 1444 there would have been no World War I, this review would be written in Deutsche (or maybe I would have brought latin back, who knows?), and my grandson¹³² would rule Earth. Knowing that, I can finally sleep in peace. I feel my entire life had a meaning, and now a whole new purpose... to play Castile next. (After becoming a junior partner in a Personal Union under Spain, winning my independence alone against them and England, vassalizing the Ottomans and succumbing to a Civil War caused by the sudden, premature death of my first independent king made me give up on returning my westernized Byzantium to it's former glory-- by the 17th century again, obviously the worst hundred of years in human history)","March 22, 2015","true","331.4"," 370 of 397 people (93%) found this review helpful 326 people found this review funny","93","370","397","326","16"

History becomes your plaything as you choose among any country that existed in the year 1444 and until 1821, not just in Europe in spite of what the name suggests, but also in Asia, Africa and the Americas. You can play as one of the big boys or you can opt to play as a smaller country and try to carve out an empire as you tangle with the big fish.\n\nBe advised that the game has a steep learning curve. Even I, in spite of my several hundreds of hours of playing this game, still do not fully understand certain aspects. The game just keeps throwing new things into your face, and considering how often Paradox releases expansion packs and update patches, the game will continue to have enough stuff to interest you for a long time to come. Whether you're an achievement hunter, a master strategist or just a casual with an interest in history, this game has something to offer you if you're willing to invest the time to learn it.\n\nThe choices you can make in this game are nearly limitless; create the world's largest land-based empire or rule the seas (or both). Control the flow of trade, or ignore it and focus on the production of goods in your lands (or both). Colonize the Americas, or play as a Native American tribe and crush the colonialists. Conquer India as a European power, or conquer Europe as an Indian power. Wage holy war against the heathens and heretics of the world, or leave them be. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. If you feel really daring you can do some truly ludicrous stuff. Play as an islamic Papal State, or create a Catholic Arabian empire. Or relocate your country to another part of the world entirely (Portugal in India, Norway in Canada, Ireland in New York, Georgia in Georgia, if you can imagine it, it is probably possible).\n\nIn Europa Universalis IV you are a painter and the entire world is your canvas.

What it really excels in is war, the other two 'focuses' of the game have been improved over time, but the game still revolves around war.  This wouldn't be a problem if with every patch they wouldn't make conquest more tedious.  From the 1.7 to the 1.8 patch (Art of War, released in November 2014), conquest was made much, much easier, and completing World Conquests (A particular feat, being the only independent nation left in the world) was made much easier.  From there, Paradox has been adding roadblock after roadblock to conquest.  This is okay, though.  If conquest was as easy as point and click, and no thought has to be put into it, then this game wouldn't be such an engaging, addicting, and fun experience.\n\nThis game's learning curve is interesting.  I can't remember much of my early experience but you're given a complex yet simple interface, tooltips that don't mean much (which has been helped with some semi-recent patches), tutorials that also don't help much, and, of course, the shock of "What am I supposed to do?  Is there a goal?"  The answer to those questions is both simple and intimidating, and it slaps you in the face rather abruptly.  It depends.  You do whatever it is you like, there is a score system but it doesn't really mean much.  That means that short of being in 1st place at the end of the game (which is rather easy for most nations), there is no goal.  You take control of your nation, you embody it.  That nation is you.  It took me about 4-6 hours to understand how to play the game, and another ~100 to 'git good'.  I stopped improving as a player (much) at about 1500 hours.\n\nIn short, this game is about entering the renaissance, takes a huge time investment, is super fun, and hard to learn.\n\n10/10 -IGN.","December 27, 2015","true","869.6"," 97 of 103 people (94%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","94","97","103","10","3"

It is an exquisitely detailed and complex simulator. Certainly you apply strategy to it to be successful within the simulation, but the point of the game is not to win. It is to explore possibilities, only a limited number of which are actually owned or even impacted by you. The smaller your nation or sphere of influence, the smaller impact you have on the world simulation.\n\nAs a result, you can find yourself often just letting the history of the game take its course for a while without making any meaningful decision. It’s a game where you often drop a stone in the water and watch for the ripples. Yes, the game has an unbelievable number of systems, but you need to approach it from a context almost like playing with sliders to see what happens as opposed to making winning or losing moves. When you see that, you’re able to begin to unlock what the system is trying to show you.\n\nThe easiest way to feel like you’ve failed at a game like EUIV is to play it like a traditional strategy game. The more you force your own ideas about external goals onto the game, the more challenging and resistant the game becomes, which, to be fair, is a fairly accurate representation of history as well. There’s a reason guys like Napoleon, Hitler or Alexander never win in the long run, and it’s because the more you impart your own will of domination on the world, the harder it becomes to maintain, control and stabilize.\n\nThis game never lies to you, but it allows you to lie to yourself all the time. You can fool yourself, as so many tyrannical leaders have before, that you have amassed supreme power and that your ascension is a destiny and foregone conclusion, only to find yourself torn down low almost at once. It’s an illusion fostered by so many strategy games that came before. The difference is, in other games, the bigger you are, the bigger your base of power from which to exert domination. In EUIV, being bigger makes you strong, but potentially fragile, unstable and absolutely a target.\n\n","February 22","true","455.0"," 82 of 86 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","82","86","6","4"

However the devs are more worried about what an elite few do versus new players and the many who simply play for fun.\n\nThis has led to a fundamental disconnect between the developers and customers.\n\nFor instance, Johan, the lead designer, had to take a poll to learn that locking away claim fabrication, and thus being able to fight wars in the early game, was an unpopular idea. He had to poll on twitter to figure this out ...\n\nThe steam store page talks about two key promises:\n\n1) unparalleled player freedom\n2) building a global empire\n\nFor some time now the devs have been nerfing the game patch after patch after patch reducing player freedom. The biggest problem with this approach is they make the game take longer sitting on speed 5 doing nothing but waiting in order to do the exact same things that players did previously.\n\nA slower game doing nothing isn't a better game. But the devs are unable to grasp this.\n\nAs to building a global empire patch after patch, taking longer to build the same empire isn't really the thing one would expect.\n\nThe odd thing is that they keep adding achievements to take lots of land while at the same time making taking land more time consuming without being more interesting.\n\nThe current version is simply boring imo and future versions will probably continue the trend.\n\nThe AI developer Chaingun referred to an in house "anti blobbing crusade" recently. They seem to not understand this is turning into an anti customer Crusade.\n\nThey ruined CK2. EU4 appears to be next.\n\nI hope they will change so I can go back to a positive opinion.","May 4","false","653.7"," 218 of 278 people (78%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","78","218","278","19","32"

A perfect example of that is territory developement, if you don't have the dlc you cannot develop buildings in a country, which is a function of the base game that you could use before the dlc, and therefore i already bought with the basic game.

PET here and I'm here to recommend you  Europa Universalis IV.\n\nEUIV is a Grand Strategy Game. That means it's pretty hard to pick up. It's something pretty unique. You start as early as 1444 and you can play with any country in the world. Yes, you head that right. ANY country in the world! The game also does not give you a purpose which makes the game a bit difficult. Some people find it hard to play a game when you don't know exactly what to do.\n\nSo this is the thing. You pick any country in the world and you do whatever you want. You can pick Portugal and try to colonize South America. Hell, you might go directly for North America. Or hell, you can even start a war with Catalunia (later Spain).

And while this is good, expanding on weak points and increasing players' options.  It also detracts from the game by forcing players to upgrade every so many months.  It is like a game you purchased for full price coming with a subscription that if you don't keep up with your game will start getting screwy.\n\nThis screwiness comes from the half-availability of aspects of each DLC, making it so that there are things you cannot do without the requisite DLC, but the game fully expects you to be doing.\n\nAside from that ever expanding problem is the tutorial, which does not keep up with the DLC.  A new player is royally porked by the tutorial as it is largely wrong and often broken.\n\nI have enjoyed it, a lot.  The game is not bad by any stretch.  But the way the DLC has gone I have become increasingly displeased with Paradox as a company and more and more I am content to just not buy anymore of these monday to friday DLC for this monkey financing games.  I will not be getting Hearts of Iron 4 until it is complete in its development cycle because of the way DLC has been handled by CK2 and EU4.\n\nDeep, rich strategy combined with deep gouging DLC...  I would skip it until you are getting the Complete pack with everything included.  Unless you are a 100% gung-ho grand strategy fan it is just not worth keeping up with the Cardassians.","March 8","false","114.0"," 204 of 273 people (75%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","75","204","273","12","29"

It starts in 1444 and goes all the way to 1821, following the proto-country you pick through an almost 400 year history.  There are over 100 Nations to choose from, among other formable ones once the proper conditions are met; such as Prussia, Egypt, and the Netherlands to name but a few.\n\nThe game is in real time, not turn-based, but you are able to pause the game to issue orders and deal with your affairs, or slow the game speed down to settings 1 or 2 (of 5, 5 basically being as fast as your computer can handle).  You build your armies and determine its makeup (out of Soliders, Cavalry, and Artillery) and this affects how battles will go.  A lot of Nations have special bonuses to certain things (like Poland gets a bonus to its Cavalry), which also affects the outcomes of battles; which are based on dice rolls (sort of like Risk) which are greatly affected by the general you have leading the army.\n\nIt is a complicated game with a great deal to learn (it makes Civilization seem arcadey), but if strategy, simulation, and history are your thing, it's easily worth the time investment and should provide countless hours of fun and content (it's on Steam Workshop and there are a ton of mods for it, not to mention Paradox often releases expansions and extra DLC artwork for it as well).  The game can also feel very fresh based on what part of the world you're playing in and as what Nation, as strategies will vary wildly depending on that.\n\nIt's very easy to recommend this game to fans of the genre.","October 30, 2014","true","864.2"," 52 of 53 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","52","53","0","1"

It's essentially the Renaissance. As the title suggests it's mainly focused on Europe but you can play nations such as Japan, the Ottomans, the Aztecs, the Chinese Dynasties, etc. You can be a western nation like England or France embroiled in the Hundreds year war, or you can be Austria, the ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. You can be Sweden and break free from your Danish oppressors and create an empire to shock all of the lesser nations. You can even play as Byzantium and overthrow the Ottoman Empire to restore the Roman Empire to it's former glory.\n\nPros: Historically Accurate\nAlways something new to do\nGameplay is always different\nVery fun in multiple aspects\nYou can make history your way\nHelps you learn a few historical things here and there\nAlways throws a challenge or two at you\nCons: Not so newcomer friendly\nCan get frustrating at times\nI've had a hell of a blast so far while playing this game. It's not too easy if it's your first Paradox Interactive game and it's certainly not easy to anyone when they first start playing. You will mess up a lot, but once you get the hang of it it's extremely fun.\n\nI seriously recommend getting the DLCs like Art of War, Wealth of Nations, and Res Republica.\n\nHere's some screenshots from games I've played previously, whether singleplayer or multiplayer:\n\nThis siege made me cry internally\n\nYou can remove kebab if you want\n\nMy friend building the Scandinavian Armada\n\nFighting the Napoleonic wars endgame, and yes, I am amazingly somehow winning that battle.\n\n\nI would recommend this and other Paradox Interactive games to you guys.\n\nConclusion: BUY IT.","January 2, 2015","true","386.9"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","93","54","58","13","1"

The goal now, is to simply monetize every single aspect of this game, and make it unplayable unless you buy all the DLCs... This is unnaceptable Paradox.\n\nFor example, they patched the core 'vanilla' version of EU IV, to add a 'region development level' feature to the game. However, you cannot actually raise the development level of a region, unless you buy another dlc called "Common Sense"... Really!?! Why are you forcing this feature onto the vanilla version, if you need a dlc to fully play it? Pardon the pun, but it makes no sense.\n\nParadox is essentially going back, and making a game you bought in the past, unplayable. It's sad how how patches meant to fix bugs, and add positive features to a game, is now purposefully breaking it so you have to pay more money to fix it.\n\nTo quote Game of Thrones, SHAME!","July 18, 2015","false","576.4"," 141 of 193 people (73%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","73","141","193","9","8"

When one DLC causes a bug, the only way you can fix it is by buying another one. The biggest example of this is the development system. Paradox has given the AI an advantage that the player will never get regardless of their country or difficulty, and the only way that you can get on even footing is by buyig their DLC.

So with this DLC coming out you have 2 new options in regards to the building system. You can be limited to having 1-6 buildings (varies depending on province) per province, with no way of leveling up the provinces to put more buildings in. This means, that at a certain point in the game, when more that 6 buildings become available, you will not be able to do ANYTHING unless you pay $15 (USA) to unlock the development feature. This honestly pisses me off because it should be in the core game to begin with, but instead they make you pay for an essential feature. Apparently it slipped by the devs minds that this game is getting very "pay to win" because without the DLC the game is trash, honestly. The DLC is bug fixes and ♥♥♥♥ that should have been in the core game, but locked behind a paywall. IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY THIS GAME, PLAN TO BUY ALL THE DLC WITH IT!!!\n\n7/10 get your act together, Paradox","June 18, 2015","false","523.9"," 442 of 669 people (66%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","66","442","669","23","33"

A great improvement from EU3. But CK2 is still my favourite!Amazing game that really makes Civilization 5 look kind of boring in comparison.\nI'm a big fan of strategy games but have always found it hard to find that special sense of satisfaction towards the end game. Many times conquering or in other ways dominating the world can be a repetitive and somewhat boring process. The Europa Universalis-series have been one out of a very few games delivering and with the latest version the team over at Paradox has made it easier than ever for new players to jump in. That said, this isn't a game for the casual player and the amount of information clearly surpasses games like Civilization. But for me, who don't mind some learning, planning and strategic thinking, it's as close to a PC-game blessing as is possible.

We began the game at 1444 and each player picked a nation. I chose tunis a small north african nation with a plan to unite africa and take southern europe by storm. Nikoli and tim decided to pair up as crimea and the golden horde with ambitions to take over muscovy before they formed russia. Patrick picked denmark, and daniel went for orissa a city state on the eastern coast of india. 3 months later the year is 1586 and the world is a very different place. As tunis i have taken control of all of northern and central africa. I also have several colonies in brazil and have succeded in subjugating the tip of italy. However my economy is in bad shape due to spain portugual and great britains repeated invasion attempts. To my east is the ottomans a massive all powerfull sunni nation who have succeded in taking a large chunk of eastern europe. Relations are tense and the only thing preventing war is my alliance with the timurids a technolgically backward horde that controls vast swathes of asia minor and india. Nikoli and tim made the mistake early on of attacking russia in the winter :D. The war lasted 15 years and nearly bankrupted both crimea and the golden horde. However they scraped a win and over the next hundred years fought off the ottomans and the united commonwealth of poland and lithuania on multiple occasions. Despite succesfully reforming his goverment and westernising nikoli's crimea was eventually overrun and he switched to play as the shogunate of japan. Tim's golden horde succesfully managed to take over the remnants of muscovy and he remains a major power in the region. Patrick managed to unite scandinavia into an empire, but grew bored and switched to playing as the papal state in italy. He is not very happy that my tunis now controls half of the peninsula and persistently declares holy wars against me :/. Daniel isolated from the rest of us has become one of the dominant powers in india and is currently colonising the spice islands. We have become very invested in this game and my dream of taking over southern europe still burns strong. Buy this game, convince all your freinds to buy this game and embark on an epic simulation of over 400 years of the worlds history.","March 27, 2015","true","242.1"," 43 of 52 people (83%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","83","43","52","14","1"

The game is played in real time but with the ability to pause at any time and the need to pause often it often has the feel of a turn based game.\n\nThere is no first person view like in Total War games and this is not an entry level strategy game like CIV5. So if your looking for eye candy, cool action scenes or a game that you can easily get into and learn you will not find it here. That being said EU4 has an easier learning curve than most of their games and that's due to it's top notch informative and slick UI. Information is easy to find and the Wiki is kept updated by it's devoted fanbase.\n\nThe difficulty levels can be changed in the settings but difficulty if mostly based on what starting country you choose. Also, the AI is well done and will give you headaches so expect a harsh learning curve. Patience and learning from your mistakes will be needed but once you get going you will fall in love for months if not years.\n\nThis is not a world conquest type game. Sure it can be done but that's for the elitists and die hards and is not what the game is built for. EU4 is a sandbox historical simulator of sorts. Historical events and themes influence playthroughs enriching the gaming experience for history buffs. This is a game where you set your own goals and make your own path. Don't expect the game to tell you where or what to do because it won't.\n\nParadox is a good Swedish company that is always putting out free updates and patches but on the flip side their major updates and expansions can be rough around the edges filled with bugs which can drive players mad. That being said they are very good at patching and improving their games. It just requires some patience from us beta testers err I mean gamers occasionally.\n\nIf you're a board game enthusiast, history buff and/or just wanting to step up to a more challenging but rewarding grand strategy game than I highly recommend EU4. Check out the free demo to get a taste.","July 11, 2014","true","991.4"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","33","36","0","4"

Seriously.\n\nIts a good strategy game and all, but it really has improved my life in other ways.\n\nFor example, I now have superhuman knowledge of trivial points in world history that will never come in handy ever. Every time i blink i see a map of continental Europe burnt into my retinas. I'm pretty sure that I have become racist towards various cultures and religions. Especially the French.\n\nSeriously, ♥♥♥♥ them.\n\nAlso stupid ♥♥♥♥ happens all the time. You've been looking at central Europe for a few hours. You pan the map to the west and notice that Haiti now owns half of America. You declare a war to claim ONE PROVINCE and before you know it the whole damn world is fighting against itself in every single continent.You feed your ally provinces from your wars and laugh manically as you watch their kingdom crumble to 200 stacks of rebels.\n\nThe game seriously plays down all the opression and ethnic cleansing that goes on. It makes it seem that all you're doing by hitting that convert button is changing a few percentage values, but deep down inside you know whats really going on.\n\nWhen you hit the harsh treatment button to lower your peasant revolt risk, you don't realize that your soldiers are storming into peasants homes and executing them just for having an opinion on how to better their lives.\n\nI mean, i didn't even notice that all of my african provinces were producing slaves until i got an event that abolished slavery. The only reason i even cared about that was because it made my monthly income go down...\n\nDon't even think about trying to be a tolerant, peace loving society. Either all the countries next to you will kill you, or the boredom will kill you, because there is literally nothing to do in this game besides wage war and find new ways to ♥♥♥♥ the common man in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nIt really opened my eyes to how terrible white people are.\n\nOverall 10/10 best opression simulator.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tyranus1331/recommended/236850/","Tyranus1331","African American","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tyranus1331/","75 products in account","Europa Universalis 4 is an extremely entertaining real time strategy game, similar to all the others released by Paradox Interactive. In the game, one is able to create armies and navies, invade and conquer your neighbors, and colonize the world. It has no real end goal, however world domination is nice. With a felxible starting date of anywhere between 1453 and 1800, there are centuries of history to play through, as historical countries, even though keeping to their set history is up to you. Europa Universalis 4 provides a platform to do the impossible, to conquer Europe as China, to maintain colonies accross the world, to destroy the largest empires, to invade Russia in the winter.\n\nHowever, Europa Universalis 4 is a game riddled with challenge. It is not easy, and players hoping to start off as the tiniest nation they see are almost certainly going to have a difficult road ahead of them if they wish to succeed. There are also other nations like France, Austria, Portugal, and Castille if you are in the mood for an evening of steamrolling the weak nations and conquering the world in one fell swoop.\n\nMicromanagement is also a crucial aspect to gameplay, and it can pose to be difficult, but also rewarding, to fully manage an economy, organize military forces, mitigate crises, and handle diplomacy. However this amount of micromanagement provides a sense of immersion into the game, and allows a greater sense of pride in tasks like maintaining a surplus and such.\n\nEuropa Universalis IV is a great game for strategy gamers, who have no doubt at least heard of other Paradox titles, but for those looking for a walk in the park as they see every nation fall to them may not be able to enjoy the game.","October 11, 2014","true","283.4"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","26","28","0","0"

I'll try to give a fairly comprehensive look at why you should or shouldn't buy this game.)\n\nI've played this game for almost 1000 hours at the time I'm rewriting this review, so i think i can be a pretty good judge. I originally didn't reccomend this game (and still don't) to the broad gaming audience, and that's for a multitude of reasons.\n\n\nCons:\n\n\nThis game is nearly impossible to get into by yourself. It's really difficult to learn how to play this game, let alone play it well. If you're not already coming from a strategy game background, you most likely will never put the time into learning this game. The only way that i originally got into it, was from being harrassed by a close friend of mine to play it with him because he wanted someone else to play it with. I've since done the same thing to many of my friends, and that's the only way I know of people personally learning to play it.\n\nSecondly, a lot of the game's essential features and improvements are marketed as DLC. I don't have a problem with supporting Paradox in developing new features for a game I really love, but they don't see how hard it is to come into the game with what I'm fairly certain is 100's of dollars of DLC at this point. Granted a lot of these are harmless texture packs for certain countries units, or new music. However, some of the patches with new DLC made vanilla Europa basically unplayable, such as the common sense DLC (ironically). When i started playing this game, there was only one major DLC released, so it was a lot easier to pay the extra 15 bucks or so on the back of my friend's promise that is was worth it.\n\nMy third major gripe with the game is that Paradox doesn't seem very willing to take the community's suggestions on game features and or balance. There are a lot of things in the game that the EU4 community doesn't like currently in the game. A quick example is the coalition mechanic. There's a general consensus that this mechanic needs to be either reworked or completely removed until they can think of a sensible way of implementing it. Another is a very disproportianate amount, and the quality of most rebellions. There's no reason that there should be 27 thousand seperatist rebels spawned from a small nation i just took over that had a standing army of 8 thousand. How did some rebel leader manage to persuede more people into joining their force than their actual nation had when they existed? Let alone the fact they can afford 6 artillery regiments. There's many examples of things like this and I've looked on every forum I could find and couldn't even find a response from any Paradox employee. Really frustrating and honestly kind of stupid considering they're essentially alienating a large portion of their small niche audience for no apparent reason?\n\n\nPros:\n\n\nGetting past all of the cons, this game is helplessly addicting and entertaining. I'd never become bored of forming a large empire out of a small county. The expansion and total control of your country is really amazing and something I haven't seen from another game before. It's given me nearly one thousand hours of enjoyment and it really doesn't feel like that will stop anytime soon.\n\n\n\nTldr: I can't reccommend this game to everyone. But if you can somehow manage to get past the steep learning curve, frustrating developer methods, and expensive pricetag, this game could provide you with a lot of fun.","April 17, 2015","false","109.3"," 79 of 118 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","79","118","3","10"

The last good DLC released was easily El Dorado, and afterwards they completely revamped the game, which was not needed once so ever.\n\nI will admit, the seige system in Common Sense is great, since thats the only part you dont have to pay 20 bucks to get. For me, to be forced to buy a 20 dollar dlc, to "develop" provinces, when the AI can already do that by themselves? Thats not difficulty, thats called being greedy.\n\nAside from that, the real reason I dont recommend this game, in it's current state, is because of the absoulute garbage performance it has. I've owned this game for about two years, and with those previous two years, the game has been amazing. It ran extremely well, and I absoulutely loved it. Today, I was just goofing around on it, and as I was playing it, I can actually say, I felt dirty playing it. It looked that bad, to be honest. It litterally looked like, my screen went from "smoother then a baby's ♥♥♥" to "nice trailer park bro.".\n\nSure, you can blame it on my garbage PC, but regardless, it looks nasty.\n\nIf you want a Grand Strategy game, get Crusader Kings 2, now thats a gem, not plagued by the 8 headless DLC horsemen. Well, it is, but atleast then I can safely say that I dont feel like a slavic pig dog while playing it.","April 24","false","384.7"," 50 of 69 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","50","69","2","3"

Addictive is another adjective to describe EU4.\n\nFirst of all: this game has not a learning curve, but rather a learning walls. Once you fell down climbing the first one, there are more walls to climb to entirely understand this game in its complexicity. So if you know that you will give up after a couple of tries, because you get easily frustrated DO NOT BUY this game. If you think you can deal with frustration, love complex strategy games and then buy this game.\n\nTo describe it briefly: You control in this game a nation, which you either lead to its glory or doom. Or you just survive. This is your job. How do you do this? You conquer provinces, construct buildings, draft armies, build ships, send them into battle. You will fight wars against neighbours and rivals and crush them or get crushed.

The content added often brings new depth to the game, but frequently has features that we shouldn't have to pay for. I'm looking at you Nation designer! Also you dirty unit and music packs should be ashamed of yourselves for existing! If you look at other game companies, they often give comparable content for free as an update. At the very base of it, I'm sick of all this piece meal DLC. I can understand expansions increasing the longevity of the game, but seriously The Cossack’s cost is 50% of the price of the base game. And don't you lie to me and say that any of these expansions add enough content to justify their price. Most of these are just slight mechanic tweaks, not anything "expansive". It’s sad when mods offer more content then official expansions and also happen to be free. I love the concept of a game developing after its release, but don’t make me pay for every slight tweak. Also don't talk to me about steam sales, the most recent releases only get 35% off. For “The Cossacks”, that's roughly 7 dollars off still leaving me roughly $13 dollar left to pay, whoopee do. By the time, we get a substantial "deal" on any DLC, it's often way down the line and Paradox has already churned out another one. All of this means two plainly disappointing facts. You'll pay considerably to have a complete and current content version of any Paradox game and that when a new game releases it's evident you're only getting a tiny proportion of the eventual game. However, I know that nothing will change as long as people keep apathetically buying the product. And so this 'just another ranting guy on the internet' is going to reach into his wallet, pull out his credit card and buy the next "grand" expansion for EU4 because oh well, right?\n\n\nUPDATE 4/10/16:\nWith the release of Mare Nostrum, It's evident that Pardox Interactive is trying to milk their games in increasing fashion. This is pitiful and doesn't show well for the future of Hearts of Irons 4, Stellaris and their other franchises. These are good quality games being subjected to obnoxious pay walls. Paradox makes base games that are just good enough to entice people to buy multitudes of DLC fillers which in the end ruins consumer enjoyment. Paradox knows what it's doing and all of their comunity streams and involvements are distractions to make us buy into a friendly exterior and therein be consoled into buying their products. The only action I'd want them to take is in their DLC practices. If you're going to sell us the game piece by piece then at least make it more worthwhile. Combine the cosmetic and music packs into their corresponding  main DLC expanision then lower the prices to $9.99 and lower. You may think you'll lose far too much profit this way or that your efforts are underrepresented at such prices, but you'll have both a greater purchasing base and a longer lasting franchise to milk if you do this. If the reason prices are so high is because not enough people are buying the product then this solution would solve that problem in the long term. If you have merely caluclated that you can sell at these unreasonable prices and still make a hefty profit then whoever made that decision should be fired. Our else, your company will be crushed under the boot of companies like Sega, who specifically has turned CA and Relic Entertainment into DLC producing Cash Cows that take all the heat.Your CEO has stated you're undergoing the IPO process, therefore you'll be an option for buyout within a year or two. The gaming industry is full of puppeted developers straddled by larger publishing corporations that use them as proxy moneymakers without taking any real accountablity. You're on a path that will be your undoing; please become something better, Paradox, not something so pitiful and so often seen with developers.\n\n\nP.S. 5/28/16:\nEuropa Universalis 4 has become a convoluted piece of crap that is hardly playable. It stifles the player every step of the way and fumbles on offering a challeging and engaging experience. Paradox is becoming a disappointment, if they aren't already.","January 28","false","99.3"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","28","33","2","1"

It doesn't need fancy graphics and extreme 3D battles, it's all up to your imagination. All you need to be a true conqueror of the world is your brain. It all comes down to tactics and knowledge. Once you got into it EUIV will drag you into parallel existence for a very long time where you can write your own history...maybe you will dominate the world...or maybe you will get crushed because you became to greedy.\n\n\nPro:\nYou can easily waste hundreds of hours playing this game without getting bored (duration of one game if you play it from the earliest date until the end: 15-30 hours)\nHigh replayability: Every nation is different and has it's pros and cons. No game will be the same.\nStrategy with depth: You have to take care of loads of stuff in your realm, plan ahead, adjust everything to suddenly changed situations and watch your friends, enemies, rivals and coalitions closely to prevent the development of bad situations and to turn it into an advantage over your enemies.\nWorld design looks great\nChange the true history and write your own\nChallenging AI (mostly)...so you don't need other players to have fun\nMultiplayer via Steamworks: I haven't played it with strangers yet but it's so much fun to play with some friends. Make plans together to dominate the world or plot against each other or just backstab your mate in the darkest hour to make profit. Everything is possible. Your friends don't need all the DLC. Every player has access to the DLC of the host. Nice feature!\nIronman mode: No mods, vanilla game settings, no manual save option, only 1 autosave slot -> this mode is the mode if you're looking for the real fun. You have to think twice before you decide important decisions because you always have to live with the outcome. This prevents you from doing stuff too careless and forces you to use your brain more. Every success will be so much sweeter.\nLoads of challenging achievements (only achievable in Ironman mode)\nSteam Workshop support: There are some pretty good mods available.\n\nNeutral:\nSteep learning curve: You will forget where your head is in your first 5-10 hours if you haven't played a title from 'Paradox' before because there is so much to take care of, but once you have learned the core mechanics you will have a blast! You will even learn new stuff after 100 hours of gameplay. This keeps the game interesting. It is absolutely worth the effort but if you are a impatient person...this game won't be your cup of tea.\nDLC politic: It's a bit controversial in the community. The main DLC from Paradox are always worth the money but there are several cosmetical packs with new unit skins or music for a few bucks. Some people are arguing that the cosmetical stuff is cut out of the main DLC to milk more money, but Paradox is saying that they're cut out to lower the price of the main DLC because not everyone needs or wants them. Those who want them, can purchase them separately while other people don't have to pay for a feature they don't need. I like it the way it is. I buy the cosmetical stuff when I like it and while it's on sale. Some extra support for the devs. You won't miss something big if you don't have them.\n\nContra:\nGerman translation: It's a mess. All games from Paradox have a messed up german translation. Missing lines, completely wrong words...simply awful. It isn't a big deal for me because I can understand english and play it with english language but there are people out there which have a problem with it. I guess the translation for other languages aren't much better. Paradox should definitely hire some proper translators or doublecheck the translation with beta tester.\n\nConclusion:\nIt's a 'must-have' for every strategy lover. Absolutely worth the full price. If you can get it while it's on sale: what are you waiting for? It's a steal. Buy it. The world, your vassals and your army are waiting for you.\n\n\n10/10\n\n----------------------\n~ Do you want to add something to the review or do you want to share your opinion?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/holsterbau/recommended/236850/","holsterbau","hauser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/holsterbau/","276 products in account","I have played this game for over 900 hours, because the older versions of the game looked rather promising. Then with every consecutive DLC and "free" update I started losing faith. Now I will just have to say that this game is unplayable, for several reasons:\n\nRather than improving and fixing the AI to suit the game, they do the exact opposite. They made a horrible, mostly useless AI and started designing the game around it. This results in a game that, inevitably, will feel less like a simulator of history between 1444 and 1821, and more like just a bunch of blobs around your blob that you have to fight. It is in no way different from RTS games at this point, except somewhat bigger and semi turn-based. Even for people who do not particularly care about history, this is still dreadful, because the AI is no longer in any way enjoyable. In older versions of the game you could actually see the Holy Roman Empire being made from time to time, but now the bots are such debiles that there is no way you are going to see that, ever.\n\nParadox Interactive are a bunch of kikes who know incredibly well that they virtually own the grand strategy market. Initially it did indeed look like PI was caring about designing an interesting game and the first DLC was kind of alright. Did not take too long to see the trend, though. They know very well that nobody will be making any similar game any time soon. Practically they force loyal consumers to pay for overpriced garbage that does not add anything, because, as already said, they know they have nowhere else to go. There are no high-budget non-Paradox grand strategy games. Below is a list explaining exactly how little all of the DLC does in comparison to the price you are paying for it.\n\nHowever, before I start, here is something you really need to know: DLC is just a cancerous term that has been made, sort of like a political euphemism, to start pushing through human vitriol that can be literally anything and charge for at the price of literally any arbitrary amount. The term "expansion packs" did not exactly cut it for multi-billion dollar corporations like Electronic Arts and Paradox (the publisher) who wished to sell garbage to the consumer. However, that is not to say all DLC can be horrible. The DLC for EU4 is cancer, though. Why is it cancer? Because it does not introduce any new game mechanics to the game. It merely disguises itself as unlocking new mechanics, but in reality the game mechanics are already offered for free, but these work only for the bots. All the DLC does is enables these features to work for you, the player, as well. That is why every Paradox Interactive employee needs to land under a speeding bus on a highway. Anyway, here it is:\nCommon Sense - Costs 12 dollars. What does it do? They like to make big lists of features for every DLC, but this is the only significant change you will feel at all: being able to improve development in provinces, add inferior static bonuses to your Protestant nation and being able to support the independence of junior union partners or colonies. Mind you that none of these mechanics are advanced. You will work these out in five minutes. This is at the top of the list because of the fact that you are paying Paradox Interactive 12 dollars for having to pay a horrendously large sum of monarch points for a meagre improvement in your provinces. The most important part is that the bot can do this even if you do not have the DLC.\nArt of War - Costs a little over 12 dollars. What does it do? It allows your ships to carry allies. Does this have any use outside of multiplayer (i.e. for allied bots?) You guessed it. No! Not at all. Okay, but what about being able to designate objectives in enemy/occupied provinces? No, it doesn't work. None of these features work, because the AI is broken. Paradox Interactive is a subsidiary of one of the largest companies in Sweden and apparently also the least competent one, full of hissy hipsters who revolt at the sight of game criticism. More on that below. It also adds a Thirty Years' War mechanic, which really is the least enjoyable event in the entire game. Oh, and by the way, you can finally make templates of armies/navies so, when you grow to become a huge nation with one million manpower, you do not have the go through the tedium of building a new army from scratch after losing someone in a battle. Why should I pay 12 dollars for such an extremely basic feature you would expect in a grand strategy game to begin with? Oh, because Paradox, and apparently we need millions more to pay for all of our five active employees (50% of population of Sweden). Not to mention, this does not work either, lol. If the landscape you draft your men from has any strait, this seemingly bugless ("What could go wrong?") feature fails to recruit men in a logical manner. Seriously, wow. Great job.\nEl Dorado - Costs 12 dollars. What does it do? Apparently gold fleets or something. Then some exploration of the Seven Lost Wonders. Then the basic feature, that should have been there to begin with, of automatic exploration. I hope you are starting to see the trend of how you have to pay 12 dollars for very, very basic and barebones GUI features you would expect from a multi-billion dollar company and publisher's grand strategy video game. Oh, and you can make a custom nation. That is probably the only thing worth paying for at all, since there indeed seems to have gone some effort into making this somewhat interesting. The values seem to all be balanced. This is the only compliment Paradox is going to get from me. Naturally, though, this is nowhere near enough to keep me interested, let alone forgive for the greed of those subhumans and senseless game design.\nCossacks - I am not going to buy this because at this point it really is directly insulting not just my own, but everyone's intelligence. They want you to pay for knowing what provinces your allies and enemies are interested in. The moment I saw this, I was, like, do they think we are Down's children or something? Why should I pay 15 dollars (used to be 20 dollars, mind you) for something so simple, something I would expect to see in a grand strategy game to begin with? When you go into a grand strategy game about Europe between 1444 and 1821, you expect all the drama that was going on. You expect to be able to interact with other nations' conclaves and heads of state in an engaging way. This was never in the game, but I had some faith in Paradox and expected this to be like that eventually. However, this dream is shattered and I have been conned by charlatans that simply do not deserve anyone's time, and, most importantly, money. I hope every single one of these debiles drowns in burning petrol.There are other DLCs, but they will only redundantly reinforce my points above. Basically, do not buy them. Stay away from this game. If you do not give any money to these people, you are enabling candidates who might rise up to fame and, in an ideal scenario, come up with superior alternatives to Europea Universalis, Crusader Kings and whatever other filth Paradox pumps out. Do everyone, especially humanity, a favour and do not buy this game or any of its "content".\n\nAs for the developers themselves: in update 1.10, they introduced a feature that makes, essentially, no sense from both a video game and human perspective. Basically, when you go to war with someone, they have military access through every single nation that gives military access to you. Yes. Not the enemy. You. Let us not improve the AI and make them stop going to wars they geographically cannot possibly win, no, let us just add a feature that makes literally no sense at all. You have to be mentally ill, seriously. Screw Paradox. I wish there wasn't a character limit on this.","February 5","false","006.8"," 36 of 48 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","36","48","6","4"

I think its better than the total war series even though the battle and war mechanics are terrible. However I would never reccomend EUIV or Crusaders Kings II to anyone for any reason whatsoever.\n\nParadox interactive is number one on my list of companies that I will NEVER buy from again. They force you to buy expansions by automatically updating your EUIV game and basically forcing you to pay for an expansion to unlock certain features. This locks you out of certain aspects of the game like not being able to develop your provinces unless you buy the Common Sense DLC.\n\nFurthermore it makes all of your previous save games incompatible. I spent 170 hours playing as England and basically getting to a point where I dominated world trade. I can no longer play that save game so essentially all of that time has been wasted.\n\nBesides whatever the initial price tag is you need to consider how much of a dent buying all of the expansions will put into your pocket. You also need to realize that you will be forced by paradox to buy future expansions and that your save games will essentially be unplayable in as little as a year.\n\nNEVER NEVER NEVER BUY ANY GAME FROM PARADOX.

It was and arguably still is one of the best games in the Grand Strategy genre. But the DLCs killed the whole thing. First, the price of each new expansion is getting above any reasonable amount for a bunch of not that much meaningful/flavorful features. Don't get me wrong, some of the expansions are great, but lots of them feel like something that should be in the base game in the first place, or not at all.  But that would be fine, nobody forces you to buy DLCs, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nThe DLC policy of Paradox is absolutely horrendous - once it's launched, you get the DLC installed automatically with a patch of base game and the AI countries are using the benefits of DLCs for themselves (the most striking example is the province development in Common Sense), and unless you pay, you are forced to compete with enemy that has a massively unfair advantage. It is a blatant cash grab and because of that, I won't be buing any more of Paradox's DLCs or new games (even though I was hyped for HoI 4 like anyone else), unless they clean their act or at least release a complete edition... although then there's the risk that it will be like the EU III Complete edition all over again.","April 7","false","235.5"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","0"

Other than its worth its purchase on how you see it.\n\nFirstly to start this review, this game will take your way of strategy in managing a country in a good diplomatic and expanding style. It is not the Crusader Kings 2, but that is not necessary a bad thing, quite the opposite in some ways. If you want to play a game that focuses on managing a country through pretty much basic but a variety of ways which focus around diplomacy, colonies and expanding. This is the game to get.\n\nPro Aspects about the game:\n\nThe Game by itself with its historical starts and able to play pretty much almost over hundreds of different nations from start to finish with many having their own ideas and historical events coming up is just fantastic. This game does show that if you make certain decisions that would have happened in real history it affects your game in the long run. Also its fun to learn about a little history about nations in a game without having to read a book about them at the same time.\n\nAnother apart from being very addictive is to make you focus rather on brute force but rather using deception strategies when managing your country. Ironically when playing later on with smaller nations I had more enjoyment in making them survive in the shadow of bigger powers and then during the end making them into large empires of their own with the former enemies now in fear. You get a sense of feeling like a proper leader focusing on expansion.\n\nCons about the game:\n\nThis might be just a little pick of some stuff but firstly the tutorial to get into the game does not really support fresh gamers to a new strategy style of game. But this is not fully a bad thing since Paradox games usually are kinda daunting to get into so, if you want to play this game (Which I still recommend strongly you try it out) Look online for guides for this is a very meaty and large in content in game. So be prepared to have moments of mass confusion though over time this comes in practise.\n\nOver a large amount of time if not managed properly your save data will pile up and start eating up your storage so if you have limited storage be sure to remove saves you don't want to keep. At one point I managed to aquire over 45 Gb of storage from just saves alone. Then again if this is taking the date of hundreds of nations and yours as well then I'm not surprised.\n\nAlso this game is not a game to focus around and command armies or navies around the world in the battles so don't expect the game to focus around that which is not really a bad thing but should not be mistaken for being so.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAlthough this game is daunting to take in at first and can be difficult in managing countries even on Iron Man Mode which makes you have 1 save on the go, this is for me as a strategy lover my most played, appreciated, loved and enjoyed game I've ever played. If you are a strategy player, this deserves a place in your game library or at the very least for you to try out the demo now and take a nation in a historical way, or change the world map forever.","April 23, 2014","true","442.5"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","1"

In terms of things to do, this game definitely has the other 3 trumped. EU4 doesn't have the specialization and complexity of the other 3 games though, that's for sure. The pros of this game are that it's easy to get into, there's a ton of stuff to do, and you are given a lot more leeway to play how you want. Overall, this game has the most "sandboxy" feeling out of all Paradox's grand strategy games. If you are coming from like Civilization or something then this game is a great addition to your collection. If you have played Paradox's previous games, EU4 is by no means a pushover as some would suggest. I highly recommend it, as you are given a lot more freedom to do what you want than other GS games.","January 16, 2015","true","48.9"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","17","18","2","0"

If you're the type of person that prefers the straight-up game with no DLC attatchments, then try this game. Otherwise, listen to my personal opinion and you can determine if you want to get this game or not. And please don't downvote this because EU4 is your favorite game ever, and same thing vice versa if you hate EU4.\n\nOkay, before I start, when I first got this game I fell in love with it. It was much more in-depth than my previous favorite game of Civilization 5, and as you can tell by the hours I have on this game, I'm not exactly new to the functions of this game. The game itself and its mechanics/ideas are great, but Paradox seems to screw up a number of games that they produce.\n\nThe reason why I don't suggest you get this game (unless if it's on sale, in which case I encourage you to try this game so long that the price is fair) is that Paradox loves to constantly update this game. Which yes, in some cases is needed, but many of them seem absolutely pointless (unless if it is centered around the release of a DLC). The reason why these updates seem so useless is that they constantly makes workshop items incompatible with the latest update. So if you've put 10+, 20+, etc hours into a single campaign that you've been working on and had plans for, and that save was connected to certain workshop items, then tough luck trying to play that campaign again. The reason is because everytime that Paradox updates the game, there's always one or two (at least) mod authors that decide it isn't worth updating their creations again (which I don't blame them, I'd feel the same way). So even if you try reverting back to the older version of EU4, then some of the mods are already updated, and same problem - it's an incompatible save. And these updates barely change the mechanics of the game itself - not to mention most of the bug fixes are done immediately after a major update, which is every update.\n\nAnother reason why I suggest to not get this game is because Paradox is sort of like EA 2.0 in which they also come out with numerous DLC expansions that can cost up to $25-$30 when first released (the older ones may be $10-$15). And these DLCs that bring "game changing mechanics and functions" in reality do jack-♥♥♥♥ in changing the game. Yes, if you were to get all the DLCs then the game would change quite a bit from its intial release state; but you'd have to pay a nice hefty sum of $120+ (if I remember I'll insert the actual price of the game + all the DLCs combined here: ) to do so. And unless you own your parent's wallet or have a pretty nice sum of money saved up that you don't mind throwing $120 into the garbage, then it's quite unrealistic that you'd want to do this (which I haven't, all except 1 of the DLCs I have I got on sale for about $5 each, and I only have 4 DLCs. I also got the game on sale as well.)\n\nSo is this game fun? Yes. Do I regret putting so much time into it? Also yes. My suggestion if once Paradox focuses on the next game in the series of these empire-building strategy games and stops with the updates and DLCs for EU4, you should immediately give this game a try. Otherwise, you're just wasting hours of your life and your money away.","May 15","false","261.2"," 45 of 68 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","45","68","2","3"

Like me the fun was over after the 100th time i had to open the defines.ini file to rechange a few lines because with each graphical update, or other changes outside the defines file it would be back to its original vanilla self after each (frequent) update. crashing the game upon reload of a save each and every time.\n\nSo i stoped playing for a while, then when a few months later i think of giving the game another try, i find it in an even worse state then before.

It has the potential to expand your knowledge of, or even develop an interest in, the subject of history - It is a series unparalleled in the genre of Grand Strategy and In the earlier versions of the game, I would have recommended it to anyone\n\nHowever, I can only in good conscience recommend this game to people who have enough money to buy all of the DLC, or at the very least, has a good friend who they can play multiplayer with who buys all the DLC. The game is not able to stand on its own merits without this. The way the DLC model in this game works is that they expand content, change systems and do other rehauls of systems; and charge money for it. That makes sense, they rehaul a system so they ought to get paid right? Well, sure, unless they take content away from the player that they originally to repackage it and sell it off to consumers, as was the case in most of the "new features" in common sense. It's a disgrace.\n\nI've had bugs occur in previous patches which were caused by not owning the DLCs; and even if you do not own the DLC, the AI (i.e. every single other nation in the game) does, which means the AI develops an unfair advantage over you in many cases.\n\nAlso, in the case of one of their DLCs, an ebook, they were literally selling Thomas Paine's Common Sense (which, by the way, is in the public domain and hence free for anyone to download online.) - It's hard not to characterise Paradox as money hungry with actions such as these.\n\nAnd unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, this series is unparralleled. I want so much to love this game, and I often do, but it leaves a really poor taste in my mouth when they do such things as these, and they have no incentive to stop doing the things they are doing because suckers like myself still buy the damned DLC, and they have no competition in this field.","June 22, 2015","false","604.7"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","22","29","0","0"

If you don't like missions you can chose them and then cancel them, the decisions you don't care about you just ignore.\nSo there's nothing stopping you making your own history.\n\nThe history and current progress of the world is written in a ledger, which is quite interesting.\nThe ledger is a very useful tool and probably worth a review on its own.\n\nThere are events, historical and generic.\nThe historical events are the only thing which force you to do things "as they were".\nUnfortunately I hate the generic ones.\nI've read that they're meant to give the player something to do and balance things, but for me they are just frustrating and just there to work against you.\nFor example, there's one where your heir falls ill. you can either spend money to send for a physician or not spending money(or ducats as they're called).\nThe "spend money" option gives the heir 50% chance of dying.\nThe other where you don't spend money a 75% chance.\nI always chose the 50% option, spend money and EVERY time the heir dies!\nOther generic things happen depending on different things, even though they shouldn't happen they do happen and always in the most inappropriate time and some are bound to happen sooner or later.\n\nSo these generic events gives me a "love, hate relation" to this game. The Iron man-mode which you have to be in to get the achievements I guess I can cope with in the long run.\n\nIn Iron man-mode you only have one save game and the game saves every month and overwrites that save game every time.\nWhich results in two things.\n1: The game progress very slowly as you wait for the save file to be written 70% of the time you play.\n2: Things which happen, either your own wrong doing or the generic events are irreversible.\nSo if you do a mistake or are screwed by an event, you have to start all over, from 1444.\n\nHaving someone nearby who can comfort you and give you advice does help to overcome these things.\n\nIf you are unsure, wait for it to come on sale, because this game is great and a "must buy" for everyone who love strategy games.","March 24, 2015","true","120.0"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","14","15","2","0"

They're doing what EA did to the Sims 3 , sell you the framework for the game at 50 or 60 dollars , and then have all of this overmarked DLC which should have been in the base game.\nEU III just havd 4 expansions that came out once a year, but At the time of writing there are 6 "major" DLCs that have come out in the nearly 2 years since its relase . Now we're at the point where paradox did a complete overhall of the province system that was in the base game , but locked parts of the new updated system behind a paywall.\nYou are now paying for an update of what was the base game at launch.\n\nIf you want to get into Europa Universalis buy EU III.

Europa Universalis IV is just fantastic and very addictive! You can choose any country that existed between 1444 to 1821 and play it. From a native tribe in North America to a great european power!\n\nIf you choose for example Portugal or Spain you can probably be the first to set sail to the New World. If you choose France or England that are in the 100 Years War at the at the start. You can also choose one of the small german states/nations and try to overthrow Austria and become the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire or play as a daimyo and unite Japan!\n\nYou have many decisions to make along the long way between 1444 to 1821. For example as England or Scotland you can form Great Britain after some objectives are made, as Castile you can form Spain. There also other formable countries for example The Polish Commonwealth, Germany, Hindustan, Holy Roman Empire, Ireland, Prussia, the Netherlands, Russia and lots more!\n\nIn the upcoming DLC Conquest of Paradise there will be new native tribes, When you conquer or colonise a certain amount of land new nations will be formed, for example if you play as Spain and you have coquered all of the Aztecs, Mayas and Zapotecs the game will form a colony nation called New Spain, that will become a vassal.\n\nParadox made a good job on this and the community is also very good! 9/10","January 4, 2014","true","530.8"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

Just like Microsoft is doing with Skype (seriously what the hell?). Common Sense locks out people who don't have it, so I have several friends who cannot play the full game unless me or another person who has the DLC hosts a multiplayer game so they can enjoy the full game. Utterly ridiculous. I have long enjoyed the game, but I have occasionally disagreed with the changes throughout the game's development. The Fort system is ludicrous because the AI ignores the forts and goes right past to destroy your army while you cannot get past their forts. The AI also will destroy you utterly after being an ally for a long period for no reason other than, "Well, I suddenly want all your land, dear ally! Sorry!"\n\nThen there's also playing moderate to small sized countries where every country around you will hate you and declare six simultaneous wars on you and destroy you before you can even do anything. I attempted a Venice playthrough three times. Hungary, Milan, Austria, Ottomans, Serbia, Bosnia, and Mamluks all declare war on you nearly simultaneously each time. Once I gotten close to destroying both the Mamluk and Ottoman navy as well as taking the Pelopponese, but then you have the issue of NO ONE wanting to ally you. Not even France and every nation dogpiling on you until there's nothing left. So, in this scenario after nearly defeating the Ottomans I am reduced to nothing and Ottomans kills everyone else. Great work everyone! Oh and more recently Ottomans have been able to ally Bohemia and Aragon with regularity. Is this an intended change to AI behavior? I do not know, but it's rather silly! Similar story with an Oman playthrough. Yemen, Haasa, Hejaz all ally and kill everyone else. Yemen gets allied to Adal who takes Somalia and Mamluks as well. Everyone else is allied against you and there's nothing you can do about it! No one will ally you and the AI make it a certainly that they will crush you for what appears to simply be existing as a player country.\n\nI haven't had any major issues since before Common Sense, but it has just been getting more aggravating. Even colonizing is stupid because even if you are a strong country, they will all revolt simultaneously every twenty years, which makes owning them not worth it unless they deliver gold builllion every few months. So, that's yet another feature that isn't fun anymore. I hope AI behavior, colonial nation behavior, development regarding people who don't own Common Sense, and the fort system being cheated by AI is fixed at some point. Otherwise, I'll just be waiting for Stellaris I suppose.","January 17","false","029.9"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","21","29","0","1"

I have quite literaly sunk weeks and weeks into this game, and thats because it was  Fun! , however its slowely turned into a massive waste of money. With almost each and every single minor or major patch a 15$ or more DLC comes in store, and while I woulden't complain if it was, say, a optional little add-on to just amplify the fun of the game, yet its almost anything  BUT THAT . Its become nothing but a long  Scam , and its gonna so far to include essentail parts of the game that make it either unplayable, or downright garbage without it, Paradox may say EUIV is a 45$ game, but in reality its a 45$ game with an extra 65$ to make it fun. And its getting even worse, for the last 2 update were hardly a month between each other (both of which came with DLC, incase you coulden't tell)\n\nNow that is outa the way, the next is about the Patch(es) itself, ever since Paradox went full con-artist with the half-♥♥♥♥♥ "patches" and non-optional DLC's, the patches are either insignigificent, or simply ruin and/or downgrade the gaming experince. This is starting to become a  Serious  problem because you dread when the next horrible broken update will come to destory all of your hard work and make you re-learn a worse and worse game.\n\nSo to give a summary, a Really Good concept and okayish game, screw'd over by a greedy and downright awful money-grabing company, using awful practices and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reasoning to mess with the product. 4.5/10 without DLC (which will change with more and more updates, most likely for the worse) and a 6.5/10 with DLC, at the cost of my wallet,","July 11, 2015","false","663.0"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","24","35","3","5"

Austria is now freaking insane, the programmerfs do not want the player to blob the map, so they make the big country AI's blob and get away with it. This steals the fun out of the game. Look I do not play this game the way you demand I play it I guess. If you are going to hit players this hard, say so. Dont take our money then force to invest time into multiple failed games.\n\n3. Cant block straits with your navy now. WTF not? Again you should tell returning players in one screen what you have changed since so and so patch in order to screw over the player.\n\nSo insummary if you start small, and try to expand at a rate that will allow you to compete with Austria or France in say 200 years, the game bends you over and flushes 8 to 15 hours of game play down the toilet. You got alot of money out of me for this game, grats. Not another dime.","January 15","false","347.7"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","24","35","0","0"

DLCs + a great Community.\n\nYou need a little time to understand the whole game mechanics if you are new (like me) to this series. But it pays off, because for other game's you need much time like for the story. Here you make your own story. The mechanics are deep and get deeper with every (major) DLC.\n\nI'm sorry I can't compare it with other grand strategy video games, but I think it's safe to say that EU IV stands out from the crowd. The amount of possibilities which country you play, how you play it (defensive or aggressiv, both has disadvantages), the time period you play it and with 'El Dorado' the customization is fantastic and so much you can't even describe it with a few sentences.\n\nSo in conclusion: Even for new and non-specialist this game should be an option. It has a great replay-value, a nice community and a growing 'supply' of DLCs.","June 9, 2015","true","610.5"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","13","15","2","1"

A great and extensive strategy game with the poetential for world domination.  Has a lot of replay value due the many playable nations, mods, and multiplayer.  Also my favorite Paradox game.  I would reccommend that you get it if you like Paradox's strategy games or just any strategy with basic clomplexity(not all that similar to the Civ games though).   Has a challenge for all skill levels from the difficulty settings to your starting scenario(such as Muscovy compared to Albania).   Has historic elements to its alternative history path.  My least favorite thing about it is the Ironman mode(which is required for any achievements) mainly because of the lucky nations setting that makes the world more historical instead of alternatively historical.  Its positives still are a lot greater compared to the few negatives that it does have.","September 4, 2014","true","931.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Instead of a dynamic empire-building game, you are left with a game that will, quite literally, severely punish every step taken in that direction. In addition, while Paradox is usually a first-class company regarding DLC practices, the most recent patch to this game renders is a hollow experience without buying the accompanying DLC, Common Sense-same basic practice seen with the Total War Series. While this is a first for Paradox, it is shameful and should be called out for what it is.\n\nIf you do buy the game, make sure to play it on an older patch. The developer's determination to make the game, frankly, slow and dull is hard to understand, but should be avoided if you decide to purchase. You need only google a bit to see people's concerns about this becoming a glorified waiting game.\n\nBottom line: Developers took this game in terrible direction, despite concerns among the community about doing so, and now we have that is less interesting (and buggy, for the moment) as a result. Do yourself a favor and buy Crusader Kings II instead. Unlike EU IV, the developers have only added to the player's options and that game's versatility, rather than turning it into the waiting game that EU IV has become. You will not regret buying CK 2, but there is every chance that you will find EU IV plain boring in it's current state.\n\nI hate to leave a review like this, as this game was just great, but the slow decline due to design philosophy to slow down expansion and every other aspect in the game, and the shameful DLC tactics on display with the Common Sense DLC, render this game unworthy of a positive review at the moment.","June 15, 2015","false","532.4"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","24","36","2","0"

This game is the grandest of all the grand strategy games existing today. This review could easily be considered as a comparison between the two games Civilization V and Europa Universalis IV.\n\ntl;dr: This a great game, I recommend you buy it.\n\nTo compare it to the game "Civilization V",\nEuropa Universalis IV focuses on more complexity with expansion and conquest, as well as more resources to limit your aggression. The strategy in Europa Universalis IV is much deeper. The historical connection is stronger. The AI is better.\n\nCiv 5 however lets you play over a very long time period. It lets you take over the entire world and stomp on the AI. It is easier to learn and master so requires less patience and persistence.\n\nThe DLC & Prices\nIn Europa Universalis IV, the DLC is not mandatory but is fun to play with. I don't recommend buying it unless you have money to throw around.\n\nWhereas in Civilization V, major DLC is mandatory for gameplay, and is considered an essential for any hardcore Civ player.\n\nTo summarize this with math; discluding sales,\nEuropa Universalis IV gives more content for its price and more gameplay as well.\n$39.99 (Game)\n+$9.99 + $14.99 + $4.99 (Optional, Non-mandatory DLCs)\n=$70.00 Total\n\nCivilization V alone isn't much fun to play, and is also pricy however it has fairly pricy DLCs to add to the game.\n$29.99 (Game)\n+$29.99 (BNW) +$19.99 (G&K) +$4.99x5 (Per other Civilization)\n=$80 Min. -- $100.00 Total\n\nI also often see the two games on sale, so I recommend snagging them up for cheap. I got Europa Universalis IV for $14.99 and DLC for $19.99, only spending about 35 dollars.\n\n\nIn summary, I like them both. EUIV as a historical grand strategy game and Civ 5 as a build, expand, and conquer arcade strategy game. Now many people will usually choose one and stick to one game. Those differences determine whether you prefer / favor either of the two games. But in my opinion, if you have the money, you're better off buying Europa Universalis IV.","July 16, 2014","true","481.5"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","1"

With a setting that begins at the tail end of the 'Hundred Years War' and continuing on past the final defeat of Napoleon, Europa Universalis IV offers players the chance to take the helm of any country that existed in that 377 year period and bring honours and glory to your realm. You can play as a great land power such as Austria, Prussia, France, or Russia, or try your hand and carving out a vast colonial empire with the Spanish, Dutch, or British. You can begin in the far east, and attempt to fight the tide of European colonial adventures into your lands, or play as an American Indian tribe and unite your neighbouring tribes into a powerful confederacy to halt the Europeans in their march westward. I cannot stress this enough, EUIV is MASSIVE and will provide you with hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of enjoyable gameplay. You will experience the dawn of gunpower, the Dash and Glory of Musket and Horse, founding and expanding colonies in the furthest regions possible. You will gain provinces, and you will lose them, but it is always possible to come back from the darkest defeat and restore the glory rightly owed to your nation!\n\nEUIV has brought out several major DLC's that add major game play improvements and additional content that genuinely allow the game to grow into a fantastic piece of art. From interesting and challenging colonial mechanics to giving the player the opportunity to create a trade empire, and from improving the combat mechanics to making religion play the major role it did in the period, the EUIV team has consistently updated the game released in 2013 to keep it challenging and in line with what the people who play the game want it to be.\n\nSome people may balk at the DLC structure in use, however with each paid DLC released the developers provide a free content pack. I think the major DLC's worth purchasing, but should you not want to do so you can rest easy knowing that you will still get free updates.\n\nIn short, put on your Tricorne, mount your horse, and prepare to fight for your God, your King, and your Country!","June 23, 2015","true","300.1"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","14","18","2","0"

I read online about it and the head AI developer Wiz said this,\n"To expound on my reply from yesterday, coring costs have gone up somewhere around 40% compared to 1.11 (more for dipannexation) because we wanted to create some more interesting dynamics where conquering everything around you was not necessarily always the best option."\n\nI don't know what planet you come from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but this is a WORLD CONQUERING game, nobody plays this game for it's rich backstory or to have fun ruling a little baby nation, the entire point of the ♥♥♥♥ing game is to conquer.\n\n"It is still both possible and rewarding to expand, particularly if you take the right ideas, put money into advisors and use a mix of conquest and diploannexing.

These are words I use to describe Europa Universalis IV. Europa Universalis IV (EUIV for short) is the newst Paradox Grand Strategy game, and unsurprisingly, the fourth main game in the Europa Universalis series. In this game you control any nation from the earliest start date of  November 11th, 1444 to rhe latest starte date of January 1st, 1820. In addition there are plenty of historical scenario start dates for you to choose from.\n\nEuropa Universalis IV is the easiest Paradox Grand Strategy game to get into. The graphics are wonderful. This is the first Paradox Strategy title I actually can play with the terrain map mode on because it looks so great. The models for units are done well, and the world comes alive as you see units moving across the map and the world go from winter to spring.  In addition, the artwork for the game looks great. From the dilemma pieces to the pictures of great leaders during the loading screens the artists did a fantastic job.\n\nThe music is beautiful as well. From the intial loading screen the title song starts to play, and generally as the song comes to a lovely apex the map of Europe unfolds in front of your eyes in a wonderful fashion. It is a really breathtaking experience. The music is well done and makes you feel like you really are running a nation of the time period covered in game.\n\nAs well, the mechanics are deep yet simple. For example, diplomacy has had an overhaul since EUIII. Now instead of having "Diplomat Points" you have diplomats who can only do one thing at a time. You could be improving relations with one nation, while brokering for peace with another, but those are your two diplomats and you can't delcare war on a third nation until one of the other diplomats is freed up. All of the people that can be used in game have changed to that system from the "Person Point" system of EUIII.\n\nAnother overhaul the game has received are the Administrative, Military, and Diplomatic points. You get a set number of these each month based upon your rulers skills, your advisors, and the base amount your nation makes. These points are used to do a variety of actions, tech up, unlock new ideas, increase stability, deal with dilemmas, in addition to a variety of other actions.\n\nEUIV is an easy game to get into, and a hard one to stop playing. It is easy to sink hours into this title without ever looking back. I easily give EUIV a coveted 10/10 rating. I have really enjoyed my time so far with EUIV and can not wait to see what the future brings.","November 11, 2013","true","68.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

To explain that a little more clearly: I arrived at this game relatively late, so I cant say for sure, but EU4 seems to follow paradox's trademark pattern of starting off promising and ambitious, improving with a few early updates to work out some kinks, and then enduring a succession of hideously awful updates which, in huge and decisive steps, utterly mutilate what a few days ago was an awesome game. It was already suffering a mild case of paradox-update cancer when I got to it; filled to the brim with an overwhelming array of impenetrable, counterintuitive, and overly fiddly interfaces and easily misunderstood and incredibly important gameplay mechanics. This gave the game a bit of a learning cliff, but at least it was playable and everything worked.\nI was in the middle of my first competent game when the new update destroyed it. Playing as feudal Japan, I had successfully united all the islands of my country under one government, eliminating the squabbling daimyos with a mix of diplomacy and brute force. I made some rookie mistakes, overcame them, and finally got the hang of things and it was really cool. Then I decided to screw with history a little bit and focus on developing "advanced" technology, which I used to explore and colonize the new world, west coast first. Then the update happened, and the entire world got covered in fog of war, screwing up my trade income (nobody knew where anyone was, so who could I trade with?), forcing me to painstakingly restart the process of uncovering it all (an intentionally slow and obtrusive process), introduced some more new micro-mechanics which predictibly add absolutely nothing to the game, and then, every financial exense associated with maintaining my empire quadrupled overnight, making it completely impossible to avoid bankrupting at terminal velocity. Makes me wonder how the other countries are doing (not that I can check, because the update erased my world map). This is extremely not cool. I spent hours on that game and then the update took a big, steaming, dump on it.","April 15","false","49.4"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","22","34","0","3"

So the actual cost of the game is 134,93€ plus Mare Nostrum 14,99€ if you want it.\n\nHowever I would recommend to revert back to patch 1.5.1 with all the DLC up till Mare Nostrum installed. That was the most fun I have ever had with the game. It was more in-depth than ever before, there was finally meaningful content between the wars, estates are a nice addition, the development and building of provinces is great.\n\nA lot of people praise Paradox for their DLC policy, because of the "extensive" free content with all major DLC and the ability to roll back to previous patches. But for a game like this the ability to roll back to previous patches is mandatory as play troughs, at least for me, easily last for 50+ even I have never played through the entire timeline from 1444 to 1820. These long games would not be an issue, but most major patches brake previous saves and as I play on Ironman (1 save & 1 backup only) I would never be able to finish any campaigns if I would live a normal life outside of the game and I would play other games than this.\n\nMost major patches such as Common Sense and now Mare Nostrum introduce new major features or change existing core features in such a way that you either become handicapped if you want to play the current version without the DLC or also the AI is handicapped to make the game fair, but it feels like you are playing in the Paralympics while the normal Olympics would be constantly dangled in front of your face as a reminder to buy the DLC. In Common Sense this feature was the province development which locked the amount of buildings you could construct in each province. This meant that if you didn´t buy the DLC and wanted to survive any wars as a small nation the majority of your buildings were forts which crippled your economy.\n\nEven though I very much enjoy the game as it is in 1.5.1 I would not say that it is worth 134,93€ unless you have nowhere better to spend that kind of money. On sale the price might be reasonable or if you find the game somewhere else for less.\n\nFanboys will give a thumbs down for any negative reviews, but I am just stating the negative sides of the game, because most reviews seem to only focus on parsing the game and the developers.\n\nMare Nostrum\n\nAs a Finn I find the cultural changes related to my culture group absolutely idiotic. Karelian is now part of the Russian culture group, Finnis are now Nordic, Estonian is part of the Baltic culture group and Finno-Ugric culture group is now just Ugric.\n\nThis would be the same as making the whole Scandinavian culture group part of Germanic and renaming the mess to German.\n\nI cannot see any reason to make these terrible changes as the cultures were accurate before. I would like to know who was the idiot who came up with this idea and why it was allowed in the game.\n\nAs a Finn I simply cannot recommend this patch as the cultural inaccuracy is appalling.\n\nFeelings after Common Sense. I was not happy.\n\nThe game is ♥♥♥♥ because of Common Sense.\n\nIf you buy the game you should downgrade it to Art of War or Eldorado.\n\nThis used to be my favorite game but Common Sense broke the whole thing and sucked all the enjoyment out of it.\n\nIt changed core gameplay features and made it so that you have a severe handicap if you do not own the DLC.\n\nParadox why u do this to us?\n\nConclusion\n\nBuy the game and all major DLC until Mare Nostrum on !SALE!, roll back to patch 1.5.1 and prepare for the best historical grand strategy game you have ever played.","October 2, 2015","false","413.1"," 40 of 68 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","40","68","0","0"

It’s been a joyride for the most part, its peak with EUII. Now, the best bit about this history simulator (a much more suitable definition than 4X or simply strategy game) was the huge amount of historical events thrown at you through time. Historical characters, wars, religious events, economic, trade and administration advances. You could actually learn a lot about history of unknown and mostly forgotten countries.\nMost of that is now gone, substituted by an easier “mission” system that allows you to pick and choose what your country is going to be. Sure the game is still fun, but it has become a lot more generic, losing that “grounded in history” feel it used to have in earlier versions, while the game engine is pretty much still the same old one.\n\nSo, is this a good game per se? Yes it is.\n\nWould I recommend it? No, as it is a huge step back from previous releases.\n\nPROS:\n-	The whole world is up for grabs, and there’s almost infinite replayability\n-	The UI is nice and easy\n-	The game has depth and width as most Paradox games do\n\nCONS\n-	35 DLCs and counting, seriously??\nConsidering most of the DLCs are utterly useless (most add songs (!!!) or tiny graphical improvements or ebooks (!!!!)). Some are meant to be meaningful (like Art of War, Wealth of Nations) but these cost 20USD a piece and add very little content.\n-	The updating policy is ridiculous and offensive: sure, patches are “free” but updating the game without getting the latest DLC (which you’d dearly pay for) the game becomes very unbalanced and clunky.\n-	Getting the game and all the DCL’s at full price costs more than 200 USD (two hundred) for a game that runs on a 15 years old engine. I got the game on a huge sale with several DLCs and still I regret spending about 25 USD for it.\n-	The historical flavour, with the tons of events that were there in previous versions is gone, making it another faceless 4X strategy game.\n","August 20, 2015","false","56.3"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","18","27","0","0"

A lot of issues have been mentioned, the most striking for me:\n\n- Fort system.\nWhat sounds like a good idea (reduce carpet sieging, make combat more tactically interesting) is actually doing the opposite: the restricted movement means your troops are basically sitting ducks until the enemy has gathered all troops and it is a big show-down. Multi-front allies are useless (Portugal + Aragon against Spain: Spain calmly superstacks Aragon while Portugal is stuck sieging a fort and can't come to help).\n\nThe path finding is atrocious.\n\nWhat it SHOULD be like: Forts should reduce movement speed and units should suffer high attrition when they move beyond your supply lines (i.e. into "prohibited" territory that doesn't connect to controlled territory - or even a controlled fort of your own). As an aside, terrain defense bonusses should not apply to sieging forces because otherwise it makes no sense to put fortresses into mountains where they historically belong because you can't relieve them there.\n\nIn sum I think Forts make wars more predictable and less tactically interesting. They could be a great addition but in their current incarnation they make wars dumber, not better.\n\n- Coring Cost, Diplo annex, province development...\nI read with amazement that some people insist that "blobbing" is still possible. I find that even modest expansion (by EU4 measures) kills any hope of technological advancement. This is neither fun nor is it historical. Monarch points now feel like a massive drag rather than a controllable resource. Province development is so expensive it makes the feature useless. I really don't see how a re-enactment of the British empire could be possible (High tech level, high development level, high expansion rate). I don't even want to think how much coring India would cost now.\n\n- Rebel Control.\nRebels occupy land within a month, so you can't really avoid rebellion success (for ewxample 10 more years of nationalism) even if you have the troops nearby.\n\n- Troop maintenance\nNot a new feature, but it should have been one. I would really like to mothball troops. It is ridiculous to have the entire Spanish army of 35.000 on high alert just because some Conquistador and his 2000 friends are exploring South America. Also, mercs should never have their maintenance reduced (minor point).\n\nSadly, this is a big step down for one of my favourite games and the multitude of issues makes the chances for fixes look remote.\n","June 16, 2015","false","665.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","1"

EUIII in comparison I felt, while rather easy (which was not a problem to me, but I do know people for whom it was) in its ease allowed for a lot of fun and ahistorical scenarios, EUIV's dedication to its idea of 'balance,' where every country has this strength and this weakness and every country is forced into these very historical highways that do not allow for fun deviations without missing out on a -massive- power advantage by strictly following history I just don't find fun.\n\nThere are also problems like the military aspect, especially early game, being the realm of the larger powers. You essentially know whether you have won or lost a war before it even begins, as if you don't have a major power on your side, or you yourself aren't, you're screwed. Even if they don't start out the war with one on their side, the scales are tipped in the defenders favor in a conflict to an insane degree. You can ally up with people and call them into defensive wars mid war. You can have people intercede on your behalf for a white peace without even giving two ♥♥♥♥♥ about your country.\n\nAll of this means that trying to turn someone like Poland or even a relatively decent power like Venice into a world hegemony is ridiculously difficult as your manpower issues and your forced historical focus keeps you, ironically enough, from doing some things that may have in fact happened historically that just don't fit the narrative of the country according to Paradox.\n\nIf you want a strategy game thats a challenge with some decent window trimming of the time period I think EUIV will do you fine. If you want a game that properly dedicates itself to allowing you the freedom to make a country and mold it in this time period according to your weird kingly whims, EUIII is still the much better product IMO.","September 27, 2015","false","71.0"," 37 of 63 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","37","63","0","1"

This is because of a few things.\n\n1) Balance\n2) DLC\n3) Stupid leave game system\n4) Botched alliance and favour system\n5) Coalitions\n\nFirst of all the balance, this game has the entire world for you to play as but most of time will be in europe. Why? Well faster gameplay stronger units on average as well as more and bigger events than anywhere else. This leads to the balance complaint. First of all if Castille decides to it can easily conquer most of Northern Africa then inherit Aragon and possible Naples very early game. Meaning they can quickly expand into Italy and lower parts of Africa. This then leads to the alliances complaint as it is entirely possible for Castille to have both Austria and France as allies meaning the main defence for Africa (Ottoman Empire) is not going to last very long especially with Poland and Lithuania glaring at them as well. A united India would struggle to push back a European power as well.\n\nThe DLC in this game while it did come out very slowly and only the host needs it is a gauling ammount. Another complaint with this is the unbalancing that Common Sense originally brought with it which if not purchased allowed the AI to develop their provinces making them much better while you couldn't without the DLC. The alliance system in the Cossacks was a step in the right direction for curbing the use of powerful nations for rapid expansion but it does not seem to have an option for 'I am attacking your rival, please help me curb their power', which I have found it to be rather annoying. Some of the features do feel like they should have been in the base game anyway such as the ability to swap occupations which came with the art of war DLC.\n\nMore of an annoyance than an actual complaint but the game shuts down briefly and reloads if you quit the game you were in. At least it is a step forward from the previous method of locking you out of multiplayer if you were going to go play with a friend.\n\nThe alliance system as mentioned before does need some work still. This because you can have all the powerful nations in the same area all allied with each other which basically means game over. I have seen this with Scandanavia - France - Commonwealth which was proberly the most annoying, Russia - Ottomans - Austria - Papal State, this one was daft. Britain - Austria - Castille - Aragon, is a more recent one I have seen. I would say this makes it interesting but they will quickly become immortal and just keep expanding everywhere.\n\nThe coalition system, now this is a huge pain. Largely because the AI never seem to get them. I have seen France take over huge portions of land in Germany in single wars and not have any back lash for it. Normally it is measured through development but since it is Germany the average values are quite high and can easily cause a coalition. I have taken 3 provinces and caused a world war to kick off over it.\n","December 27, 2015","false","970.9"," 30 of 50 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","30","50","0","1"

A ton of replayability, though it is lacking in the early game if, like me, you like to try out a ton of different nations before deciding. There are fun events, though it can be lacking here as well. There is a lack in general events that happens for everynation, with the exeption of different crises or the recurring nobles wanting stuff. There is also a lack in variety in regard to government and administrative rule, although this might be fixed with the next DLC, Wealth of nations.

First off, if you did that you'd get a massive coalition and secondly, your country would implode from being at war too much and ceding too much land too quickly.\n\nEU4 is a constant struggle against the AI especially if you challenge yourself and choose a nation that isn't historically powerful.  That is the best way to play EU4 in my opinion - choose a goal and try to achieve it.  Want to make The Hansa a thriving and powerful European nation in 1821?  Want to expand the Papal State to own half of Europe by 1821 and shout "God WILLS IT!" a lot?  Want to play a Native American tribe or the Aztecs and stop Europeans from gaining dominance in the new world?  You can do all these things and play them out in what I would consider by far the most accurate and representative game out there.\n\nEU4's interface is daunting at first, no doubt, but later you realize that it is that level of detail that makes things play out more similarly to real life.  Your people will get upset if you're at war too long, your allies might not go with you into every war, some people wont ally you because they just dont like you or your religion or whatever, some wars you lose even though you have 2x their troops but they have better troops and more tactics, if you spend all your administrative power ceding provinces from enemies you'll fall behind in administrative tech and you'll also gain corruption in you nation.  All these interactive elements form a platform for empire building that is hands down the closest to reality out there.\n\nEU4 is not a 4X, it is in the truest form of the word a simulation of real world empire building.\n\n10/10 in my book.","May 20","true","578.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Also this is more of a review of patch  1.13.0.0\n\n\nI loved this game. I really did.\nBecause once upon a time I could have fun conquering the world, making huge trade-based empires.\nNo more.\nNow all I get is patch (as if it fixes ♥♥♥♥) 1.13.0.0, which just ruins the game and everything it used to be.\nThe patch adds:\nForts! And their "zone of control". First of all the AI doesnt give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about your forts, just wading right through them, when you, as a player, have to traverse half of ♥♥♥♥ing Europe to get to the province next door. ( Zone of control is also broken by military access. Which is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid !!!)\nDevelopment! Taking out the building system of old, and replacing it with broken ♥♥♥ development system, that you can't ♥♥♥♥ing use unless you buy the ridiculously overpriced DLC, ironically named Common Sense...\nManpower revamped! Now your pretty little manpower pool will deplete even faster! This is actually okay and maybe even balancing, but not when you lose 10.000 manpower sieging one ♥♥♥♥ing fort, to simply realise that the army you've now been persuing for 2 ♥♥♥♥ing years is not reachable. Not after this fort even.  Because the AI just built another adjacent fort while you were sieging the original one.	   Forcing you to siege this one too.\n\nARE YOU KIDDING ME PARADOX\n\nSo much overpriced DLC essentially ruining what use to be your perfect game.\n\nEUIV has for me, become more of a rage quit simulator than a grand strategy game. I hope that I'll be able to play it consistently in the future, without getting ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ed by cheating AI.\n\nI would rate this patch  1/10.\nSorry for long post but no ♥♥♥♥ing potato here.","July 13, 2015","false","483.8"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","19","30","5","18"

Fortunately, as with a lot of Paradox titles, recent updates have been increasingly making the game better than what it originally was. While some changes have been poorly received and needed adjustment later (Paradox's newfound popularity has also come with a much larger number of people only familiar with EUIV and CK2 giving feedback upon yonder forums.) Paradox seems to have found a direction that properly takes (good) player feedback into account, without relying upon it too heavily.\n\nIt's not quite the game I wanted it to be, with some mechanics changes simplifying the game in a negative way (restoring stability with the push of a button when you have sufficient points is far too simple.) and other EUIII mechanics remaining that are only hurting the current state of the game. (Missions are terribly outdated things which can hardly be said to function in the current state of the game.)\n\nDespite all this, it's still a very fun, easy to play game. Perhaps with some more updates (and a few mods...) I'll be able to say EUIV is a masterpiece of a grand strategy game.","November 2, 2014","true","112.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xpom/recommended/236850/","xpom","Captain Butthurt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xpom/","649 products in account","Well, where to begin... It's a rather complicated task to explain what this game is to somebody, who never touched any other Paradox Grand Strategy game. It's probably better to begin with most popular tags:\n\n- Grand Strategy : Grand - for there's whole world to play with ( both explored and uncolonized ) - several hundreds of provinces with their cultures, taxes, production, trade power, etc. Strategy - well, because it is one. It's Real Time Strategy, pausable by hitting space or by tinkering "smart pause" options - game will automatically pause when specified by you or default "trigger" events fire (like another country declaring war on you, etc).\n\n- Historic : Game covers time period from 1444 to 1821, possibility to start playing any day between. Default "timemarks", offered to player are rather historically accurate, with actual leaders in charge of their nations, pre-existing alliances and other diplomatic relations, etc. Amount of research done by Paradox is impressive. But once you start your game and unpause it, weirdest stuff can happen, like AI-controlled Poland taking over Europe, lol.\n\n- Simulation : Game engine takes into consideration MASSIVE amount of data and processes it simultaneously ( diplomacy, economics, religion, stability, rebels, trade, research, national ideas, terrain, army commander skill, etc,etc ). What is pleasantly surprising, and frankly - shocking - is how despite having so much information to work with, player is saved from micromanagement by smart UI design ( which only is getting better with updates ). You don't have to babysit every province or army (unless there is serious battle nearing, in which case it's only natural to pay more attention to your soldiers, lol), observe multiple tradenodes or dig into complicated UI for some basic info. Everything you need can be accessed by 1-2 LMB clicks, and UI itself can be easily configured to suit your needs. Gameplay is actually relaxing, once you understand basic concepts.\n\n- Sandbox : Because nothing restrict your moves and imagination by handicapping you. You just start a new game, pick a nation ( btw, you can pick ANY nation on map - from giants like France to smallest african tribes) and voila - you are completely free in your actions. IMO best example for this would be playing as Irish lord : you can go "classic" way of forming Kingdom of Ireland first, Great Britain - later, or pull off crazy stunts like rushing exploration national ideas, exploring and colonizing Americas way before other European nations and moving your capital there.\nThere is some kind of "missions" which you can go after - but nothing MAKES you complete them. They are mostly aimed at "historically accurate" playthroughs for those new to that nation\EU4 and are there to hold hands of newbs who are usually shocked by lack of any kind of "corridor" they are used to.\n\n\nFor those who want to compare EU4 to other games:\n\n- Crusader Kings 2 : EU4 is overall more complicated, mostly centered on country simulation instead of that semi-RPG gameplay of CK2. Leaders here are placeholders with 3 basic stats, and you don't get attached to them like you do in CK2 (I still remember my afro-Tzar Putiata of Russia from my 2013 playthrough, lol)\n\n- Total War series : It's RTS, less graphooney and combat is calculated in the background, and player has no way to influence the outcome, other than deciding initial army composition, hiring high-skill commander, choosing battles wisely and rushing additional armies into provinces, where battle occurs.\nIt may seem dumb at first, but there are a LOT of charming underwater stones that you HAVE to consider : different optimal army composition that depends on tech group of your nation, your current military technology level, etc; picking right terrain to fight on - countless options.\n\nAll in all:\n\nPROS\n- Everything stated in "tags" part\n- Huge replayability\n- Huge amount of content to discover and learn.\n- Fair DLC policy : they are well worth the money, big part of them gets patched into game for free for everyone else, multiplayer game host can be the only one with all DLCs - game counts everyone who connected as if they had same DLCs as host has.\n- Almost bugless (unless new DLCs\patches are introduced - even those are fixed pretty quick)\n- Mods\n\nCONS\n\n- Tutorial is... lacking. But paradox strategies are well know for that, so it might turn into a feature one day, lol. Seriously, read the wiki or watch letsplays. Learning curve is steep.\n- It's sometimes hard to establish a good multiplayer game with pub strangers - most are leaving pretty quickly.\n\n\nP.S\nIf you need any guidance on this game - feel free to add me and ask questions\n\n","June 27, 2014","true","112.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpmrx/recommended/236850/","dpmrx","Viishnahn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpmrx/","159 products in account","This game will take hours off of your life (in the best way possible).\n\nEuropa Universalis IV [EU4] is a grand strategy RTS from Paradox Interactive. The game is set on the earth anywhere within 1444-1825, focusing heavily on colonization, imperialism and the influence of the papacy and the Holy Roman Empire on the rest of the known world at the time.\n\nI don't think I've ever fallen so completely in love with a game since I discovered the Metroid series. One of the things that bug me about RTS games is that usually, during the late game, there isn't much to do since your economy is self-sustaining and the most attention-consuming task is managing military units. EU4 goes so much more in depth than any other game I've played before (to be fair, it is my first grand strategy game, so I don't know how it compares to its peers).\n\nI like to always have my mind focused on something and can get bored quite easily at times. While there are slow times like in any other game, EU4 has so many little tasks and situations that need occasional checking up, as well as random events every so often, that your mind is almost always engaged.\n\nThe learning curve is quite steep for this game, in my own experience (around 20-30 hours to grasp many of the subtle yet critical elements). I recommend starting as the Aztecs for your first game - no one in Central America can build ships for quite a while, so you will be able to focus on understanding how the basics of land combat work. You will be defeated multiple times your first few playthroughs. Don't give up - this is quite normal. Also, turn player bonuses on in the menu for your first few learning games.\n\nI won't go into detail on the elements of the game since there are SO MANY - this review would probably take about 20-30 min to read if I did and nobody likes that :/\n\nIf you need help learning the game, the in-game tutorial didn't do much for me. I hear there are superb video tutorials on YouTube, so check those out if you so desire.\n\nAs for DLC, there are currently five official expansions and numerous music/cosmetic enhancements. I have purchased a few of the music/cosmetics and cannot complain, but I have not purchased any of the expansions and so cannot comment on their value.\n\nI have used the Extended Timeline mod extensively and completely recommend that you try it, but play some vanilla games first since it is essentially a complete overhaul.\n\nI have lost much time to this game. Whether or not that is good is for you to decide. I wholeheartedly recommend this masterpiece to anyone who claims to enjoy strategy gaming.\n\n+ FIVE THUMBS UP +","May 24, 2015","true","363.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Just a warning, the learning curve is massive.  If you think Sim City or Civilization is difficult to learn, you should not play EU4.  The game is not much in the way of graphical showcasing, but it makes up for that with the thousands of real-time modifiers happening in the world.  Strategy really matters in this game and there is a very active forum & wiki community to help figure out what you might not notice (did i metion thousands of modifiers?).  The developers are also active in the community and have been releasing DLCs and patches to evolve the game as the player base becomes more 'intellegent'.  The Multiplayer community can be hit or miss, since it takes a lot of dedication and time to get a game to the finish of 1821. The game is inifinitely more fun in multiplayer since the AI is predictable after a while.","September 7, 2014","true","275.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Paradox Interactive regularly adds new free content along with every dlc they make and the dlc adds some great features that are worth the price. EU4 is very fun once your into it but it takes quite a bit of learning to get into it and one of its faults is the tutorials lack of help when it comes to learning the game. If you are interested in this game and haven't played a Paradox Interactive grand strategy game I would highly reccomend watching some people play it on Youtube since it really helps you learn the game better. This game does a great job of allowing to conquer the world however you want with any country in the game. Yet world conquest isn't the only way to win as you can focus on a colonial trade power, unifying the Holy Roman Empire, or many different ways to play.

Along the way, you have to manage diplomacy, military, economy, trade, exploration... Well, mostly diplomacy and military, the remaining areas are more of a side thingy (as in, peace is boring).\nThe game has no mentionably good graphics, but will probably eat your CPU anyways if your tower isn't current, double so after the 1.8 patch (which, despite the developers stating "there should be no noticeable performance change, is A LOT more demanding).\nThe Multiplayer mode is by no means stable and has it's regular moments of desync and reconnecting, but it's definitely playable and fun. As well, the developers pronounced multiple times that EUIV is meant to be a Multiplayer game. Which probably explains the barely adequate AI (let's say, it does some things fine but is so utterly horrible at others that it requires tons of AI-only advantages to give them a chance against even the newest player).\n\nHowever, what needs to be mentioned here that Paradox, since I've started following the developement of CKII and EUIV, has been on a steady decline in quality. Every patch seems to introduce just as many bugs as features, sometimes even making the game completely unplayable.\nTo make things wore, the devs have as well started to completely neglegect old mechanics or content in favour of constantly pushing out new DLCs. Which are usually full of new half-baked concepts that need to be overhauled in a hotfix a week later (and this is not a hyperbole, this happened literally two times in the last four patches).\n\nAnd sadly, there is another source of frustration: the developers themselves. Upon one of the fail-patchesmentioned above, the game was near-unplayable due to obscene amounts of rebels popping up (to the degree where you may or may not got a random event spawning SEVERAL TIMES your maximum army size in rebels, causing a complete massacre to most AI states). This was pointed out less then a hour after the patch release. Johan, Paradox lead developer responded, and I'm not kidding you "It's not our fault if the players don't know to play the game, our QA tested the patch and it is fine." When the community responded in uproar, he added "And now see how ungrateful you are. It's weekend and I'm spending my free time in this forum and those complaints are all I get." Needless to say, two days later a hotfix was released repairing the changes. Shortly following that, Johan created a new dedicated EUIV lead developer position and has since then not been very active in the EUIV forum anymore (which of course implies he never apologized or rectified anything).\nI'm currently eagerly watching the new lead dev's steps, hoping he might change EUIV's dev policy and save the game... but it just seems to be a dream hope for the time being.\n\n\nRating: 8/10 Great game, even though it has a few weak spots.\nBut Paradox currently shouldn't be supported. Vote with your wallets and stay away from this game.","May 29, 2014","false","934.6"," 65 of 119 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","65","119","0","0"

You must guide your nation of choice to world dominance through conquest, diplomacy and colonization. Controls are pleasantly abstracted - for example, when you dicover a new kind of military unit, you can upgrade all your armies with 1 click. There's little to none micro managment, you can devise your sophisticated plot and relax in your chair as you can setup a full scale invasion with just a few clicks. Game is visually appealing, though, in my opinion, EU would look better with 2D graphics (instead of full 3d).\n\nThere's only one thing that i really dislike about this game - the combat resolution. It has very sophisticated algorithm with dozens of parameters. It's very vague and as a player you have absolutely no idea what the hell is happening unless you invest an ~hour of researching on the internets.\n\nAll in all EU4 is one of the top games in its genre.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strategypony/recommended/236850/","strategypony","Tidal Charm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strategypony/","138 products in account","My first experience of Europa Universalis IV was a mixed experience. I bought the game on the advice of a friend, and played a multiplayer game with him. I picked the Ottoman Empire -- as the game recommended -- and proceeded to build what I thought was a decent empire primarily through militarism. I swept through eastern Europe and western Asia with ease and controlled everything from the east of Poland to the west of India.\n\nAs the game progressed, however, I began to lose control of my land to the newly formed Russia and to Poland. It turned out that, because I hadn't understood the game, I hadn't kept my military tech up to date or westernized. I love depth in games, but the frustration of losing large parts of my empire before the game's end because of a misunderstanding of priorities put me off, and I shelved the game for a while.\n\nLater on, in one of my periods of watching a lot of "Let's Play" videos, I found someone playing Europa Universalis IV and began to understand the things I had done wrong. I ended up watching the entire (40-odd part) Let's Play and learning a lot about the game, which gave me an itch to pick it back up and try it again. I'm glad I did. This game is incredible.\n\nThe war system is one of the most well-designed that I have ever seen. Generals give bonuses based on their statistics, based on whether you're attacking or defending. The system requires a good balance of infantry, cavalry and artillery to get the best out of your conflicts. You have to move your troops in reasonably sized platoons to avoid attrition losses in hostile terrain.\n\nWars have to be justified, either based on a(n often fabricated) claim to the territory being invaded, religious differences, trade disputes or a myriad of other reasons.

I bought the game on the advice of a friend, and played a multiplayer game with him. I picked the Ottoman Empire -- as the game recommended -- and proceeded to build what I thought was a decent empire primarily through militarism. I swept through eastern Europe and western Asia with ease and controlled everything from the east of Poland to the west of India.\n\nAs the game progressed, however, I began to lose control of my land to the newly formed Russia and to Poland. It turned out that, because I hadn't understood the game, I hadn't kept my military tech up to date or westernized. I love depth in games, but the frustration of losing large parts of my empire before the game's end because of a misunderstanding of priorities put me off, and I shelved the game for a while.\n\nLater on, in one of my periods of watching a lot of "Let's Play" videos, I found someone playing Europa Universalis IV and began to understand the things I had done wrong. I ended up watching the entire (40-odd part) Let's Play and learning a lot about the game, which gave me an itch to pick it back up and try it again. I'm glad I did. This game is incredible.\n\nThe war system is one of the most well-designed that I have ever seen. Generals give bonuses based on their statistics, based on whether you're attacking or defending. The system requires a good balance of infantry, cavalry and artillery to get the best out of your conflicts. You have to move your troops in reasonably sized platoons to avoid attrition losses in hostile terrain.\n\nWars have to be justified, either based on a(n often fabricated) claim to the territory being invaded, religious differences, trade disputes or a myriad of other reasons. You'll want to forge strategic alliances in order to take down common foes, but be wary of making your future adversaries too powerful, as they will often decide when they share a border with you to do the same to you as the two of you just did to your common foe.\n\nThe leader system is one of the weaker points.

Now I really really really really REALLY sucked at that game, Infact I still couldnt play it properly after trying for weeks because the learning curve on that game was as steep as Mt. Everest yet I enjoyed ever second of it. When EU4 was released I was excited and also intemidated based on my previous experince with EU3. I can now say after playing 80 hours, EU4 is just as fun as EU3 and is so much easier to learn. Even though it still took me about 20-30 hours to learn the game, once you climb that learning curve youll be humbled by just the amount choices you have in directing where your country will go. I highly reccommend this game to anybody who likes strategy games just be warned, If you're a Total War fan or a Civ fan those games will never be the same after playing EU4.\n\nEDIT: Those 80 hours were only spent playing as three different factions (western countries at that). I still have yet to try out the colonist part of the the game, let alone play as a muslim, horde, indian, chinese, japanese, or meso-american faction.","March 1, 2015","true","302.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I had never played it and did not know anything about the game when I grabbed it as part of a humble bundle deal. I assumed from the title, as well as the cover photo's of the game, it would be much like Civilization or Tropico, with a historical slant. What I found is, Europa Universalis IV has much more in common with Crusader Kings. You build up your territories, similar to the way you would in Civ, but you are given the opportunity to micro-manage your country, down to the last detail of what religion they will be. The array of starting countries is not limited to Europe and Asia, you can even start out as a Native American tribe in the yet to be discovered, "New World". Europa Universalis IV, can be unforgiving to the novice, and it can easily be turned into a numbers game, so it may not be for everyone. Having tried it even though it is not my typical genre, I enjoyed it and might give it another shot some time. Until then I can only say, if this sounds like the type of game you enjoy, then you should really like Europa Universalis IV.","May 20, 2015","true","15.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

It has a lot to live up to considering the success of their last two major titles, Europa Universalis III and Crusader Kings II.\n\nSo does it live up to it? Ultimately I think so. It streamlines many of the aspects of EUIII and CKII that turned away many novice strategy lovers. Recruiting soldiers is easier, the Trade system is more intuitive than before and the game really makes an effort to encourage the possibility of a mostly peaceful game, which is good because it feels good to switch it up every once in awhile.\n\nNot that it's eazy to run out of things to do in EUIV. You can choose literally any nation in existence on any day in between 1444 and 1821, and although some are less fleshed out than others because they played a lesser role in history, the fact that there are so many options is by itself astounding.\n\nOverall, I give EUIV a 9.1 out 0f 10. I haven't fleshed out all the reasons in this review why it is so worth your 40 dollars, but just rest assured it is totally worth that amount (although I'd still reccommend waiting for the inevitable sale.).","September 6, 2014","true","368.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Find allies, and crush the baguette, remove kebab from Europe or stop Russia from annexing Crimea 400 years before Putin was even born. It's your choice. And if you ever get bored of the main game, there are great expansion packs that can squeeze some more hours, even when your playtime is in the thousands.

When I first started, it was all so confusing. I stared at menus blankly, watched youtube tutorials, played through in-game tutorials. Could this really be the most accessible strategy game Paradox has to offer? Yes; and it's also one of the best expreinces I have ever had in my gaming life. I've spent entire days playing, watching the years go by. How am I going to deal with France? Should I ally Austria? THERE IS NO WAY I'M GETTING INVOLVED IN THAT WAR SCREW YOU AUSTRIA *declines call to arms*. These are some the burning questions I've asked and loud statements I've shouted during my time playing EU4. I played my first game as France. Easiest country in the game bar none. I got better. I played as Venice. Got better. Soon it wasn't about "winning" or even doing well, it was about proving to myself that it could be done. Can I form the Netherlands as little Friseland. Yes, I can. Can I beat back the Ottomans as Byzantium? NO, NOT THAT. But through each failure I learned. Through each success I learned. I learned about the time period, I learned how to strategize, I learned how to accept defeat, I learned the joys of winning an impossible war, and I learned that I loved strategy games.

I highly recommend that you do the tutorials first, the game can be very confusing and complex, time is essential to succeeding and creating your empire. With over 100 hours of playing, I'm still not the best at the game, it takes time to finally figure things out. So I only recommend this if you're willing to be confused for a while until you learn the basics and than the complex stuff.\n\n\nIn my opinion, there are a few countries I would recommend you playing as if you're a newbie depending on what your goal is.\n\nIf your goal is to make a lot of money, then I would suggest either Venice or The Hansa, or any other merchant republic country. Venice & The Hansa have access to some of the best trade nodes in the game, giving you a reasonable amount of income, but also their ideas I believe do help a lot. (Don't quote me on it, haven't played as em, just heard about em)\n\nIf your goal is to create a military empire, I would suggest France for the most part, due to their traditional ideas, and the fact that they have a brilliant army at the start of the game. Giving you an advantage over your rivals and enemies, but time is your enemy, as France has some powerful countries as rivals, such as Austria, Burgundy and sometimes Castile.\n\nOverall, a brilliant game with great mod support.

War score and military acess rules make the war more realistic. It's much more friendly for achievement players in this sense and only drives you mad in rare occasions.\nComparing with VICII, the learning curve is shorter. As long as you know how to manage your national ideas and understand all those modifiers, you can just get through it quickly.\nFor the new players, starting without ironman is a nice choice. A castilian compaign will let you understand the general mechanism of the game including vassals, personal unions, crusades and colonization. A moscow game will give you some ideas of the technology group and none catholic countries. An australian compaign will introduce the mechanisms of the HRE and diplomatic power.\nIf you are a fan of map/history, it would be a nice choice for you.","December 16, 2013","true","177.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

Unfortunately, Paradox are money grabbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and you need DLC for it to be enjoyable, so I would only buy this when it's on sale. Here's some opinions on different aspects of the game:\n\nWarfare: The AI is way too eagre to take attrition. I'm talking about 20k soldiers sitting on a fort which needs 6k to cap. I'm talking about 30k sitting on their 25k supply capital. The AI loves to sit around doing ♥♥♥♥ all while their army dies. Now, it's been about 2 and a half weeks since the last DLC, so I'd expect the game to be pretty playable right now, but you can observe your allies being utterly useful a lot of the time. You may think this doesn't matter if you're reading this review a while in the future, but just be warned that when Paradox releases a DLC, the game is usually broken and will be quite buggy for weeks.\n\nEconomy and Colonisation: The whole "trade flow" thing is great, and helps bring more meaning to colonisation through bringing tons of American and Asian goods to European markets for sweet sweet ducats. However, it also limits your expansion to specific regions, which makes the game slightly railroady when it comes to colonisation, if you care about being cash-efficient. Playing Spain or Portugal? North America is completely pointless to colonize, at least in terms of trade. You're trying to colonize as somebody who didn't historically colonize, perhaps someone in North Germany? You can colonize Canada and that's pretty much it. Really though, trade flow should be less restrictive. Especially when you consider the way treasure fleets work - if Spain colonized, let's say, Canada, and found gold there, would it be impossible for them to transport that gold back to Spain? No. But is it impossible in game? Yes.\n\nMonarch Points: Until Common Sense, monarch points, or 'mana' was my biggest issue with the game. Now that you can create buildings without it, I'm less inclined to curse Johan's name for this stupid concept. However, it's still needlessly restrictive. Why should inventing technology and assaulting a fort use the same resource? Why should I not be able to offer a peace treaty, simply because I hired a new Admiral? Come on Paradox, out with the Führer mana, in with some more common sense.\n\nDespite all this, it's still a really fun game. If you're interested in building an empire, or rewriting history, I would reccomend this, but only if it's on sale.","June 26, 2015","true","897.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

See, if the series was set in Europe alone, full stop, this would have merit, but the whole world is opened up and yet somehow the Great Mughals or Ming (two examples) are supposed to care about a mini-empire far far away (Austria, default country of interest sooner or later, wherever or whatever you may be playing).\n\nI have never understood this virtual hapsburg Shrine nor want to anymore.

In a nutshell this is easily one of the best strategy games available at any point in the history of gaming.\n\nStill reading? Ok. Thanks...let me make it worth your while.\n\nI've played EU, EU3 and EU4 and this is the best of the series. The other games engaged me for 30, 50 or 60 hours. That's not bad but they never entirely grabbed me. This one is simply a better game than anything Paradox has ever released. The new Clausewitz engine renders this game beautifully. For those worried about the multitude of DLC packs, don't be. The base game plays beautifully and it feels complete. I only purchased the DLC well after I had 100 hours into it. Some may find the DLC worth it. I certainly did. But if you don't get it you're still buying a complete game.\n\nSo what makes this game good? Options and choice without complexity. EU4 is the epitome of "every action has an equal and opposite reaction". Sure, you can play as a massive warmonger and try to gobble up everyone. But then you'll have to deal with the internal unrest and your neighbors banding together to take you down a peg. You can play as a nice neighbor and not attack anyone but then you'll have to deal with keeping major allies happy in order to watch over you. You'll have scenarios where lifelong allies of yours attack each other and you'll have to decide which one to back.\n\nDo you build up? Do you build out? It's all up to you. You can take France or the Ottomans and try to dominate the world. Or you can take a tiny country and just try to survive. And there's no "victory" in the game. Whether or not you won or lost is your call, not some arbitrary game decision. Meanwhile, you're balancing military, political ramifications, gold, your provinces, technologies and a host of other factors. It's a lot to juggle but it's not overwhelming.\n\nThere's a learning curve here, but the new engine makes everything more accessible than ever. Thus while some people have been put off by the complexity of this series in the past, this one is actually fairly easy to get into. Now for someone who is entirely new to the engine it's going to take some time to learn your way around. It's not a typical strategy game where you can rush your actions. You have to take your time, plan your actions perhaps decades in advance and then be ready to strike at a moment's notice. It's wonderful fun.\n\nThere aren't any large flaws with EU4, which is one of the highest compliments I can pay a game. It is highly recommended for any strategy gamer's library.","March 24, 2015","true","568.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

You have an absolutely incredible amount of flexibility in how your country is shaped.\n\nWhere many other games focus on war, diplomacy, or trade, EUIV does all of that, most impressively it does it all without any one element feeling less viable or over powered. You may send ambassadors or fling insults, forge claims to neighboring lands, arrange marriages, crush you enemies, collect intelligence, bribe cardinals, dominate trade routes, and colonize the new world all at the same time.\n\nThe tradeoff here is that Paradox Interactive had to sacrifice accessibility for complexity.

All mechanics changes (sieges, unbalanced costs for coring and diploanexing, removing buildings, turning good and easy buildings managment into piece of micromanagement crap) are just stupid and silly. Best one - they did not changed code of AI. Yes, AI is behaving like in previous version (and often can't move at all).\nUpdate and "Common Sense" ruined EU4. Don't even waste time on this game.

It changed with the recent patch, I can no longer support this company or any of it's endeavors because of what they're doing. What are they doing? Well. Let me just paint a picture.\n\nBefore Common Sense. Provinces had no way to upgrade their base tax or things such as that without constructing buildings. You had no limit on the amount of buildings you could construct. Forts were nothing more than a defensive bonus to your provinces.\n\nBut with this DLC which patched in all of it's mechanics into the base game. Your provinces are now upgradeable! Huzzah! You can put investments into the development of the province to increase it's base tax. However, the buildings are now restricted base on how much development you have in your provinces.\n\nNow. That'd be all fine and dandy if all the good parts of those changes weren't hidden behind a paywall.  Activating forts to prevent your bordering provinces from being taken? Nope. Pay up first buddy! Investing in development so you can improve your economy and have more than two buildings per province? Pay up!\n\nI renounce my loyalty to Paradox as a whole.

I have almost 1500 hrs logged into EU3 and another 3-4000 hrs spread across HOI3, Crusader Kings 2, Victoria 2 and Sengoku.  EU3 was easily my favorite of the bunch...\n\nSo on to my impression of EU4.  Imagine EU3 with better graphics and all the fun ripped out of it stillborn and left to die on the operating room floor.  They have ruined this game.  Ruined.  R.U.I.N.E.Duh.\n\nIn the interests of me not having an aneurism, I'll just limit my comments on the weird, delusional, nonsensical "coalition system" to this.  Great concept, worse than amateur level execution.\n\nNow on to my biggest beefs...  Defeat your enemy in battle then beat him to the next province to cut off his retreat?  Well go ♥♥♥♥ yourself, his troops are all magic ninjas with the special ability of being able to hide from your ARMY.  Want to go invade your enemy?  Not so fast, there's a castle two provinces adjacent that magically prevents your army from moving there.\n\nI have no problems with adding in game mechanics to help balance things, but this is ahistorical horse ♥♥♥♥.  If I wanted to play a game that had a "fairness fairy" I'd play something in the fantasy genre.  I come to Paradox for REALISM.  Not for magic castles that prevent movement in neighboring duchies just because some re-tarded asshat wanted to add maintainence for castles and now we need to balance that.   And I understand Paradox has ALWAYS had weak "stack mashing" battle mechanics, but historically as well as in EU3, the majority of casualties occured after an army routed.  Maintaining control of an army in full retreat across multiple provinces is a herculean task.  If you ain't Napoleon, you ain't doing it.  And yet...\n\nI waited patiently for them to fix the broken, ♥♥♥♥♥♥, lazy fake-♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics with patches or DLC.  Meanwhile I played CK2.  Now Lo and behold some of this stupid ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ has begun to appear in CK2.  Hey Paradox, your "broken retreat" concept is a broken game mechanic.  And its driving this loyal paying customer away from your games in disgust.","February 25","false","68.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","4"

In my opinion the game is one of the best strategy games of all time.\nGameplaywise it is quite unique.\n\nI still can't recommend buying it...\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\nDLC:\nYes, I know that this is a review for the base game. However I think it is important to know about dlc and dlc-politics before buying a game.\n\nimportant note:\nTill now  8 major dlcs have been released for the game. Those dlcs are usually accompanied by a patch, which brings changes for everyone. But if u want to have access to all possible gameplay elements, if you dont want to stumble accross something like 'need to own XXX dlc to YYY', if you want the game to feel truly complete, you will have to buy atleast those (debatable). All other dlcs solely add new music and unit modells to the game, which do NOT influence gameplay. See eu4wiki for details.\n\nAllthough the release of a new dlc every few months means that the game gets more content,\nit has its downsides besides the need of cash:\n\nBugs and unbalance. Usually every major dlc brings new gameplay mechanics or radical changes. With them bugs come; the new mechanics are rarely balanced. Therefore one or two hotfixes follow every patch. Which can give you the feeling of having bought something incomplete or not fully tested.\nSavegames. Whenever (or mostly) new dlc is released you will have to take special actions, if you want to continue a game and not start over again. You probably will have to do this before starting the game, otherwise your savefiles will be corrupted and your savegames will be lost. It will NOT matter, if you buy the new dlc or not, because the patch that accompanies the dlc will break the savefiles. A single run in this game takes many hours, therefore this is very important to know.\nfeatures. Be aware that features added in dlc, may later be changed, moved to available for all or even completely removed.\n____________________________________________\n\n\nWhat kind of game it is?\nThe game itself is a sandboxy grand strategy wargame set between 1444 and 1821. Your job is to take over the role of the ruler/rulers of one of the countless nations of that time period and lead said nation to glory. Besides 'glory' there is no fixed goal. You choose your own goal. You can play as Spain and explore and conquer the (or a random (dlc required)) new world. You can play as China and colonize America or conquer Asia. You can play as Austria and reform the Holy Roman Empire into one state. In case you are good enough, you can even conquer the whole world. The choice is yours!\n\npro:\n\noverall deep and interessting gameplay\nnearly infinite amounts of content and not completeable game (or atleast thousads of hours)\nsandbox game\ninteressting period\ncontra:\n\nvery difficult to learn for new players\ngameplay mechanics are not always explained in the game and tooltips are often misleading or wrong\nai gets bonuses (more diplomats, more money, ...)\nai sometimes behaves unforseeable or just weird (allies may 'betray' you without any warning)\nbugs stay around for a long time while constantly new bugs turn up and others get fixed\nsavegames get corrupted by patches/are incompatible with new patches\nmultiplayer (unstable). Many players seem to have problems with connection in mp.\nluck based. For example there are random events throughout the game. While many of them add flavor to certain nations, they are all random and you can get screwed by them. Battles partly include luck.\nThe Gameplay is considerable poorer in times of peace. Which is a problem, because bad luck (for example with events) can force you to stay at peace for a long time.\n\n(Dlc can be viewed as good or bad based on what I wrote before.)\n\n\nAt this moment I have played the game for nearly 1000 hours and will most likely still play it for hundreds of hours. Like I said in the beginning I love it. I bought all of the major dlc at or close to realease, except the latest (Mare Nostrum, out 3 days, I will probably buy it at some point). Which means I spent about 140€. At this point, after almost 2 and a half year, this game feels like an early access title.\nThat feeling and the sum led me to the insight that i can NOT recommend buying the game, allthough I love it and buying dlc now or at sale would be way cheaper. Sure it is possible to enjoy the base game, but it will feel incomplete.\nThere is literally no other game where I could tolerate said things.","April 8","false","936.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

This game suits all your grand strategy needs and creates challenging situations through new mechanics such as aggressive expansion and coalitions. For people who complain about the learning curve of Paradox titles, I'd recommend this as the best game to pick up first. It might well be difficult to learn, but it is interesting enough to keep you entertained and incredibly rewarding when you get the hang of things.\n\nThe replayability is also a huge plus (as it is with most Paradox games). The amount of countries to play is fantastic and there is a huge amount of variables that mean that two games are rarely the same. Adding to this, the amount of mods trickling out extend and improve the games playability as well as Paradox's expansions which aim to improve how 'lesser' countries play out.\n\nIf you're interested in grand strategy games, it's a must-buy.","November 27, 2013","true","644.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Whenever I siege and occupy a province and move my men out it will un-siege itself and I have to re-siege it. I was at a war with Ottomans and I was about to win till my Objective province got un-sieged and I lost an army stack because while I was re-siegeing it his main armies came and destroyed everything I had. I could have won and could have peaced out if I had that province but that fact that this DLC has made it so it un-sieges the provinces I take over makes me mad and it costs manpower to re-siege and manpower is something that is valued in this game. Not to mention the new Outrages Admin points you have to spend just to core one province, I full annex Wallachia under Hungary, it costs over 400 Admin and I am saying, "Good Job Paradox you have ruined my game!" Also this is not the only bad thing Common Sense has done to our beloved game, it made it so when AI fight their armies go crazy around the map, and thats not even the worst part!

I siege all the balkans under Ottomans Control and it is only 6% Warscore, what the actually heck.

I can't believe I'm saying this, but I genuinely enjoy how terrible these developers and publishers are. They are so evil it's actually ♥♥♥♥ing funny.\n\nBasically, long and short of it, ever since 2013 the developers have been holding the game hostage. Every couple weeks, they'll 'update' it, consisting of several dozen 'features' that you have to pay for. 20 bucks each DLC. If you do not have this dlc, that's okay. You just can't use the features.

But I've been disappointed every single time I load it up and give it another try. It could be so much better.\n\nHere's something to understand if you're thinking about trying it: It's more like Risk than Civilization. It's a game about conquering territory, not building an empire. War is the only practical thing there is to do. If you're not at war, you're just gonna be staring at the screen for hours waiting for numbers to go up.\n\nNothing will make sense to you the first time you play this game. The amount of help provided is very limited, and the UI is very confusing. Icons without meaning abound. Numbers and modifiers are given without explanation of what they actually do.\n\nIf you stick with it, you'll discover that fighting and conquering land is kinda fun. Troops are moved around in real-time, which makes it feel realistic. I'm sure I would have more to say on combat if I knew more about how it worked, but of course, it isn't explained very well. 90% of the fun in this game comes from looking at the territory you own and thinking "Ahh, look at all the land I own now."\n\nThe massive amount of provinces and nations in this game is really, really cool. There are hundreds of nations, and every one is playable, from the biggest to the smallest, from Europe to Africa to Indonesia to America. However, nations outside Europe receive crippling penalties that end up making them much more boring to play than they should be. Different regions of the world have different technology penalties. East Asia, for instance, has technology 60% more expensive, and certain regions of America have technology 250% more expensive. You can remove this penalty through an extremely painful "westernization" process. I dislike this system immensely. I wish there had instead been a set of technologies the more primitive nations would have to go through before getting caught up. This would still have kept them behind the Europeans, but it would have given the player something to do. Instead, my native tribe seems to consist of a bunch of morons who can't learn.\n\nMost things in this game require a resource called monarch power to perform. This comes in three types: administrative, diplomatic, and military. You get a base amount of monarch power per month, and then the rest is determined by your advisors (which you can hire for gold, if you have enough) and your ruler. If your nation isn't a republic, you can't control who your ruler is...and your ruler massively influences how much you can do in this game. If you have a good ruler, you can do all sorts of fun things, but if your ruler sucks, you're stuck sitting and waiting for decades of game time and hours of real time to do anything at all. Waiting seems to be a common theme in this game's play.\n\nYou can build buildings in your provinces if you happen to have lots of gold, but it's not very interesting to do so. The buildings have only a small effect individually. Like I said, this game is more about taking land than developing a nation.\n\nExploration and colonization was something I was excited to try, but it turns out you can't do either until you take very specific policies...I wish every nation could expand to unoccupied territory from the very beginning, but this is not the case.\n\nI find that most of the strategies I try this game are...cheesy. For instance, if I'm a weaker nation and I want to bully some of my neighbors out of their land, I will attempt to ally with a strong nation, get them into my war...and then make sure my armies land on the provinces I want to take before theirs do, because whoever starts a siege on a province first gets claim to that territory. This doesn't make me feel like I'm winning, it just makes me feel like I'm gaming the system.\n\nThere are more things I could complain about, but the gist is that this game seems awesome yet constantly disappoints me. If you like maps and war, you'll probably like this game. If you like SimCity or you're the kind of person who prefers peaceful victories in Civilization, you probably won't.\n","October 28, 2015","false","107.9"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","1"

Especially fun with many friends on multiplayer; this is when the game is incompareable to anything else, it IS grand stratergy. You really get drawn in and you get stuck to its sticky bosom of pure enjoyment. You really feel you're building an empire, and there are so many playable nations you literally can replay the game thousands of times, for thousands of hours. It is also one of the most easily modable games on Steam, with many mods adding even more greatness to an already great game.\n\n-tive Points - If you're new to stratergy, this game throws you into the deep end and you will spend a LONG time getting to grips with the multitude of mechanics. Battles, although fun and challenging, can be repetitive with the same animations and tactics, a little more variaty and interactive-ness is needed in my opinion. Multiplayer HAS A LOT OF ISSUES. Although it is the best part of the game, the servers have many issues, with players frequently and randomly disconnecting or not even being able to join a lobby. A game in multiplayer may take time to get going, but when it does, it is AMAZING!\n\nOverall, if you love stratergy, this is a requirement. If Paradox can sort out multiplayer servers and issues, you would be looking at a 10/10 game here, but these issues do make the game frustrating at times.","August 18, 2014","true","529.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eisotopius/recommended/236850/","eisotopius","Eisotopius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eisotopius/","104 products in account","Europa Universalis IV is a very simple game, in theory. You control a nation, from 1444 to 1821, and lead it to world dominaton or commercial dominance or whatever else you want to do, using your military and diplomats to get what you want.\nIn practice, it is incredibly complicated. Every country not controlled by a human is being run by the AI, even if you can't see them. Every other country will react to changes in the political climate as they happen, generally resulting in very unexpected endings. Each country will have its own opinion of yours, influenced by things like who your enemies are, how much land you took in recent wars, what religion your country practices, and even whether or not they just want you dead to begin with.\nThere are a variety of ways to make other countries see more highly of you, just as there are ways to make them want you dead even more than they already did. You can annex smaller neighbors that think highly of you, or you can go to war and dominate your neighbors instead. Each country has a goal, and these goals will change dramatically over the 380 years you have to act. Each country has its own bonuses; the Merchant Republics of Venice and Novgorod are in a great position to amass large quantities of wealth, if they survive. The giants of Muscovy and Austria can easily dominate anyone who tries to oppose them.\nThe question is, what is it you want to do? The Byzantines, driven to near destruction by the Ottomans, can still be led to the restoration of the Roman Empire by anyone willing to lead them there. The Swedes, in the Kalmar Union under Denmark and sure to be annexed, can remove the Danes from their throne and become a colonial empire under the right leadership. There are, without exaggeration, an infinite number of possible directions you can take this game. The El Dorado expansion pack and its custom nation designer only reinforces this; build a Muslim republic in Lithuanian land, conquer Russia with it, and then become an Islamic Russia. Set up a Jewish empire in Ireland and conquer England. Whatever. Go do it.\nNow, I assume, you're thinking "Ok, that's all good, but how well is it executed?" Flawlessly. The incredibly complex diplomacy system gives every nation a mind of its own; every country will forge alliances and make enemies by themselves, and you can manipulate that with ease to ensure a network of powerful alliances with which to conquer the world. The military system, equally deep and complex, can lead to wars lasting anywhere from merely a single year to several decades. Use technology to outmatch your opponents, and defeat them with a vastly superior army, or expand as much as possible and defeat everyone with sheer numbers.\nThis game, essentially, is the definitive strategy game. Watch as the world changes and as empires form from nothing. Build your own empire and stop all the others. There is infinite replayability; a game will never end the same way twice; Steam achievements give a reason to try many different countries, lean several strategies, and conquer the world ten times over; multiplayer adds an extra layer of madness, allowing you to conquer the world with your friends, only to have them betray you later. There is no good reason for anyone interested in history or strategy games to not buy this one; it is, in a way, the perfect strategy game. The expansions only make it moreso, but add an entirely new system to learn. Even without these expansions, however, there is an almost endless supply of extra content available for free, right here on Steam. With mods, this game can become new again, even for a seasoned veteran of 3000 hours.\n\nIf I have only one complaint of this game, it is the multiplayer community, and even then the game is not at fault for this. Too often, people will host games and simply boot anyone they don't want, or else make up some sad story to convince people to leave on their own. There is a very simple way to prevent people you don't want to play with from entering your game: put a password on it, and share it with people you do want to play with. This problem leads to another: the lack of a good supply of people with whom to play online multiplayer. Every once in a while, a good person will come along and allow everyone to play with him. These people are, unfortunately, rare, but when they do come along the experience is almost always a great one. There are some synchronization problems with multiplayer, as well, but any game as large as this, when hosting several people at once, is sure to have these, so again I cannot fault this game specifically for that. There will be bugs; it is difficult, after all, to solve every single problem when there is so much code to check; but when there is a problem that the developers have not found, once it is found and reported it is usually corrected soon after.\n\nI therefore conclude that this is one of the best games of all time. I can highly recommend buying it, even at full price, and I would rarely advise buying something at full price.","March 11, 2015","true","198.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","2"

It is better than Total War and Civ by far IMO due to its design.\n\nIt is real time and may seem complicated to play with the overwhelming interface, but it really isn't. Their are no resources like food or wood to micromanage for example, all you have to worry about on the surface is stability,unrest and your income. Other things like war exhaustion and aggressive expansion come into play also during conquest.\n\nThe diplomacy in this game is the most functional I have ever encountered in a strategy game and has real consequences.You can know based on your diplomatic score how nations will react to you most of the time which comes in very handy. For example, when deciding to declare war on a common foe unlike Total War or Civ you will know beforehand if they will join you or not based on various factors, you will also know whom you will be up against.\n\nDiplomacy is essential to your survival, and can really make or break your game. You are not likely to survive or progress in the early to mid stages of the game if you do not form alliances. If you are too aggressive and ♥♥♥♥ off the wrong people, coalitions will form and attack you and force you to give up territories.\n\nThe game is real time and you can adjust the speed to speed up during slower times in between conquests or to slow down to micromanage your troops and events at a pace that is comfortable for you.\n\nThis was a breath of fresh air for me coming from Total War Rome 2 where campaigns can take 40 hours or more to complete. Depending on how fast you set the time it is possible to finish a campaign depending on your goals in around 10-12 hours. Additionally, all nations are available to play each presenting the player with a unique challenge and experience.\n\nThis game is a sandbox game, so there are no "victory conditions" unlike in Civilization or Total War, which gives you total freedom to pursue Ironman achievements, focus on building a trade empire, colonize, lead a crusade, overthrow the Holy Roman Empire, become the Emperor and many more. For example, you can play as The Ottomans who have the best starting position in the game or you can play as The Knights of Rhodes who have nothing but a tiny island and are in one of the worst starting positions in the game, being threatened by The Ottomans for a different challenge.It is totally up to you. There is nothing more satisfying than triumphing as a small nation over larger foes through skill and diplomacy.\n\nEvery game plays out differently due to the AI RNG which allows for almost infinite replayability.\nThere are many achievements to get that are very rewarding and challenging if you play in Ironman mode.\n\nDLC:\n\nThere are quite a few DLC that are essential to getting the full experience out of the game. They are good in that they add new features that are blocked behind a paywall in the base game but bad in that you have to pay extra for them. The reality is that most of them are not essential to the game but Art of War and Common Sense should be the ones any player has at a minimum.\n\nThe DLC can be found on sale typically during steam sales for very cheap or you can go to 3rd party sites to find them for an affordable price if you don't want to pay full price.\n\nThe learning curve is steep and I am still learning things so it is highly recommended that you search the wiki and watch YouTube videos to learn the fundamentals of the game as the tutorial is seriously lacking.\n\n\nOverall as a complete game. I cannot say enough good things about it. It is currently IMO the best grand strategy game on the market even with the DLC business model.\n\n\n10/10","March 15","true","528.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's so thorough and realistic! You simply cannot build a massive empire without worrying about stability, and even when you do begin to get big, you have to worry about coalitions, other massive empires! It always keeps you on your feet in some way no matter how powerful you become.\n\nFeatures I love tremendously:\n\nModding Community. I can't express how awesome the modding community is for this game. My favorite mod is the Extended Timeline. I created a massive Germanic Empire covering europe following romes demise during the migration period(I replaced the roman empire, and more, hehehe). I even took on the mughals (which formed from parthia.\n\nFrequent Updates and Patches. This just shows how much Paradox Entertainment cares for their games to keep them entertaining. The new Art of War expansion added so much! 900 extra provinces, 150 new countries, new rebellion mechanic, better war mechanics.. that is just the tip of the Ice berg!\n\nhttp://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?810805-1.8-Full-Patch-Notes\n\n\nDiplomacy. This is tremendously well done. You can literally manipulate the throne of another kingdom and force them into a Personal Union (only if your Christian, since the AoW update). Diplomacy dictates every corner of this game. If you expand too quickly, your neighbors will see that as 'aggressive expansion', and possibly form a massive coalition against you. This is an amazing game-balance mechanic, as it prevents big empires from going on a conquest rampage. You are forced to form alliances no matter what nation you start as, least you fail the game in the short run, and if not the short run, then the long run.\n\nWar. The war.. It's so amazingly realistic. It makes you feel like your fighting against another nation like they would in that time period (With crusader kings being even more accurate in this regard). Every single day begins to count during a war (real-time after all, no joke) The way a war is fought is heavily dictated by the supply limit a province can provide your troops. A smart enemy can fight a war of attrition against you, making you lose thousands of troops each month while you flee.\n\nExpansion. Yes, I love how the expansion isn't dictated by what you occupy, but what your warscore is in a single war. This boost the realism level to almost as high as it can go. Historically it was impractical, and logistically impossible to conquer a huge empire in one war. You would have mass rebellions, and administrative problems to say the least. Couple this with the over-extension mechanic, and that is where the realism really blossoms. Even when you conquer a small section of an enormous empire, and you still have to deal with massive instability and revolt risk!\n\nHonestly, this review only covers a small fraction of the awesomeness of this game. There are so many equally awesome features that I have not covered in this review, and I'm lazy. If you are a fan of conquest games, you should buy this game undoubtedly - unless you prefer the style of CK2 over EU4 (I like both).","November 12, 2014","true","578.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I do admit the last couple of dlcs have been lackluster (Mare Nostrum, and The Cossacks specifically), however if the dlcs are not giving enough content for their price do not buy it. It is your choice if you decided to pay fifteen dollars for a lackluster dlc and the opinon of the dlc should not be the determination for the base game's score. There are many excellent expanions released for eu4, that in my opinon would negate any negativity from the last two expansions.\n\nThe base game in itself is a game that I would reccomend playing. I have played many hours in vanilla itself. The game is a grand strategey with much more depth than games like the civ series. You play a nation of your choosing, and attempt to do as best as you can with it. Some nations are easier than other due to this game being based on history ( France is stronger than a Native American nation). The game is like a puzzle, many hours will be spent figuring out alliances, truces, aggressive expansion opinon modifiers, religion to be able to conquer the world without destroying yourself in the process. There are national ideas and events which make many nations unique in their playstyle, and there are idea groups which you unlock which give you various bonuses that can further specalize your nation. One thing that is amazing about this game is whenever something happens that could ruin my game it is always my fault, and it is something that you can learn from and choose to never make the same mistake again.\n\nThe DLC is one thing that is essential to review, there are a lot of dlc for this game. Don't judge the game on the the price of every dlc combined, many DLC are just cosmetic and music addition packs. There are a few dlcs that are expansions to the game ( Res Publica, Wealth of Nations, Conquest of Paradise, Art of War, and Common Sense) which in my opinon are all essential and worth every penny spent on them. If you are scared of the hefty base price of these dlc combined, don't be scared as they frequently go for sale up to 75% off, so you can get all these expansions for less than 10 dollars if you wait for good sales. If you wait long enough the recent dlc (Cossacks and Mare Nostrum) will probably be given huge sales as well.\n\nI would not reccomend this game who are looking for quick fun, this is a game you sit down for hours at a time to plan and fail, and then restart the game over, and then fail but do a little better, then fail fail fail, and then you may finally perfect your game and do way better. A single playthrough can take around two weeks to get through, while it may take a lot of time it is really satisfying when all goes to plan and you acheive your goals. I would reccomend this to people who enjoyed civ games but are unsatisfied by the lack of depth or strategey in those games, I would reccomend this to people to have enjoyed playing Risk. In fact I reccomend this to most people I have met.\n\ntl:dr\n\nA lot of reviews are being unfairly negative about this game to their opinon that the recent two expansions are overpriced for the content they delivir (I share this sentiment). However this game has a lot of other expansions that are really good that balance this out. The vanilla game is in itself really good. Don't expect a fast game, or something that you can just pick up and play I have played around 700 hours and am considered a intermediate player. While a bit diffcult to start it is an amazingly satisfying game when your plans come to fruitation.\n\n10/10","June 5","true","756.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

You can play with >260 natioms.\nIt also has got a dynamic economic system that you can manipulate with trade ships or owned land in the certain trading node. I also enjoy the military and geopolitical factor in EU4 because its the best part in my opinion.\nThe actual combat is pretty unique because unlike in the Total War series, it is like a board game. You have to pay a lot of attention to various factors: you have to pay attetion on your tech level, the terrain (NEVER underestimate the terrain), the morale of your troops and their discipline, if you play smart you can kill a larger army by simply having high morale, good tech, disciplin and a terrain advantage on the other side if you act stupid and attack an enemy that has got these advantages you'll possibly send your loyal troops into a deathtrap. This can be frustrating but it isn't the games fault your decision your fate.However, this is just one way annexing it in a peace deal there are more ways to get your empire to grow: gain territory through a personal union (royal marriges pay of) or vassilize the country and integrate it into your grandé nation.\nAnother important game mechanic tool is the diplomacy you can ally, sabotage, create/join a coalition , support your allies. There's a lot more you can do it's just an insane amount of opportunities in order to make histroy as YOU like it.\nNow I'll come to the best part of that this game has to offer: the community, the community is smart, backstabbing :) and very into EU4.\nIn addition to that there's also the genius modding community creating ahistoric mods, game improvements, essentially everthing that you search in the mods you'll find it!\n\nNow to the negative parts:\nThere are not a lot of negative parts so i'll keep it as short as possible.\n- Not very stable multiplayer\n- localization issues with non english versions\nWell thats all i have to complain about at the moment.\n\nI would totally recommend you buying EU4 if you're into history or/and strategy games because it will suck you in and steal all your free time.\n\nThats it, if you dis/liked this review please comment it and I apoligize for spelling/grammar failures as I'm no native english speaker.","November 26, 2013","true","538.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Karthak/recommended/236850/","Karthak","Karthak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Karthak/","255 products in account","Europa Universalis IV is a Grand Strategy Game developed by Paradox Entertainment. The game allows you to take control of a country from the time period of 1444 until 1820 (An official save converter for Crusader Kings II can push this date as far back as 867). The country pool you draw your selection from is vast, ranging from future world powers like England, Sweden, and France to Native American and Meso-American tribes like the Shawnee, the Cherokee, The Aztecs, and the Inca. Keep in mind that every country is not created equal; Western Countries have a much easier time as opposed to those with Eastern or Tribal cultures. Westernizing as a tribal group is always a must; you will be crushed otherwise.\n\n\nIn Europa Universalis IV, the world is your oyster. Your goals are yours to define; Emergent Gameplay is very much a key point of the game. Do you restore the Byzantine Empire from it's single holding of Constantinople? Do you attempt to conquer the new world as the Ottomans? Or do you follow the historical path of your country, such as colonizing the New World as Spain or Portugal? All of these scenarios are able to occur in the game, and feel immensely gratifying when completed.\n\n\nThe Game plays like a charm, although I would recommend turning off Lucky Nations as they tend to skew the game in the AI's favour, with the game following the Earth's history a bit too closely. England, France, The Ottoman Empire, and Spain all usually end up becoming the defacto world powers with Lucky Nations set to historical. With Random Lucky Nations the game becomes a bit more interesting, but I would still say to turn this setting off.\n\n\nThe game also has a large learning curve, though the tutorial in the game helps you get the basics of the game down. The rest, however, is up to you to verse yourself in. You will lose. Often. But those often are not like those other strategy games such as Civilization. These losses teach you all kinds of interesting facets of the game. In no time you'll be ensuring the nation you're about to crush has no alliances with a more powerful Nation, or that they're currently weak thanks to fighting rebels that you spent some ducats to support.\n\n\nOverall, I heartily recommend Europa Universalis IV. Though it's hard to get a grasp on the genre, Grand Strategy Games never fail to provide an entertaining, thrilling ride throughout a possible alternate timeline.","December 30, 2013","true","20.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NovaCoru/recommended/236850/","NovaCoru","NovaCoru","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NovaCoru/","289 products in account","I can say a lot of things about EUIV.  From a pure gameplay perspective, its very good, much more accessible then its predecessor that I've spent so long playing.  The revamped coring, culture changing, and technology systems using the new monarchy points system, while incredibly gamey, are much nicer from a practical point of view from its predecessor's "wait a long time/throw lots of money in this vague direction" systems.  Graphically, its much prettier, with the terrain view especially showing off just how gorgeous Pardox has been able to make their games nowadays.  Gameplay-wise, the game is easily a 10/10 in my book.\n\nMy main problem with the game is that it basically doesn't really care about any country or culture that isn't from around the mediterranean.  Even then, if you aren't European or the Ottomans, you're pretty much out of luck unless you buy all the Muslim DLC!  Eastern Asia has the changes from the EU3:DW expansion, which is nice, but still is lacking in the depth that you find in Europe, and India suffers from this as well. I am glad Conquest of Paradise improved the Native Americans though, as before playing as them was essentially a test in patience, as nothing happened until the European invasion.  I do understand the game is "Europa" Universalis, set in the time where Europe historically dominated, but having some more filler for the non-European countries could only, in my opinion, improve the game.  But after 3 expansions with 2 1/2 of them focused on Europe, it leaves me kind of concerned.\n\nOverall though, the game is still really fun to play, and you can find yourself easily putting hours upon hours into each game.  The extensive modding support, characteristic to all Paradox games, also helps a lot in this regard.  And though it doesn't really meet the extreme rigors of my non-European playstyle, what it still has is great, and if your looking for a good strategy game, you can only really do better, in my opinion, with Paradox's other big hit, Crusader King II.\n\nP.S. if your looking for good mods, my personal favorite is Occultuis Orbis Terrestre, which adds all the legendary and forgotten lands explorers had thought existed at one point. Also, check out the main overhaul mods, Veritas et Fortudo and MEIOU and Taxes.","August 7, 2014","true","279.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

For example, playing as a catholic nation, you can vote bishops by using your religious influence on the Papacy and the bishop may even become the Pope.\n\nThe military system is also improved a slightly more detailed. It offeres a much easier to manage system wehre you can easily split your troops, move them or even recruit. There are also more types of rebels and even flags to represent them. They are much more powerful in comparison to EU III and if you're not careful they can really screw over your nation.\n\nThe player has more control over colonization and how it works making you feel more in control of your empire. You can send colonists to a specific place (depending on your technologies) and you can either try to work together with the natives or send down an army and slaughter them all.\n\nThe technology 'trees' have more to them now in comparison to the previous title and uses a point system to unlock different technology types. The point system is where the game unfortunatly the game fails. It offers three types of points, Administrative, Diplomatic and Military. All these are harnessed over time but the speed they are harrnesed at depend on your monarch and the advisors you have. With these points you can unlock new technologies, reduce your over-expansion, increase stability,decrease inflation and etc. This system makes the game feel way too arcadish, and you'll find yourself finding all sorts of ways to aquire these points but they make no sense realistically. the Europa Universalis series was very popular for it's somewhat realistic approach to things, making it more of a historical sandbox simulator rather than a Star Craft like RTS except on a huge map, trade and diplomacy. It is also far less challenging to achieve certain things in the game like form a commonwealth or a nation (but that's not always true, some are still fairly challenging).\n\nAll in all it is still an enjoyable game and it's even more enjoyable if you're playing it with the MEIOU and Taxes mod which offers a much more robust religious system, more historicaly accurate map, general rebalances and much more.","November 25, 2013","true","145.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

For example, playing as a catholic nation, you can vote bishops by using your religious influence on the Papacy and the bishop may even become the Pope.\n\nThe military system is also improved a slightly more detailed. It offeres a much easier to manage system wehre you can easily split your troops, move them or even recruit. There are also more types of rebels and even flags to represent them. They are much more powerful in comparison to EU III and if you're not careful they can really screw over your nation.\n\nThe player has more control over colonization and how it works making you feel more in control of your empire. You can send colonists to a specific place (depending on your technologies) and you can either try to work together with the natives or send down an army and slaughter them all.\n\nThe technology 'trees' have more to them now in comparison to the previous title and uses a point system to unlock different technology types. The point system is where the game unfortunatly the game fails. It offers three types of points, Administrative, Diplomatic and Military. All these are harnessed over time but the speed they are harrnesed at depend on your monarch and the advisors you have. With these points you can unlock new technologies, reduce your over-expansion, increase stability,decrease inflation and etc. This system makes the game feel way too arcadish, and you'll find yourself finding all sorts of ways to aquire these points but they make no sense realistically. the Europa Universalis series was very popular for it's somewhat realistic approach to things, making it more of a historical sandbox simulator rather than a Star Craft like RTS except on a huge map, trade and diplomacy. It is also far less challenging to achieve certain things in the game like form a commonwealth or a nation (but that's not always true, some are still fairly challenging).\n\nAll in all it is still an enjoyable game and it's even more enjoyable if you're playing it with the MEIOU and Taxes mod which offers a much more robust religious system, more historicaly accurate map, general rebalances and much more.","November 25, 2013","true","145.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quizlord/recommended/236850/","quizlord","Jonas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quizlord/","53 products in account","This is one of the greatest grand strategy games out there along with CK2. Basically you pick any country (that exists) in the world from near the end of the Middle Ages in 1444 A.D. to 1821 A.D. at the end of the Napoleonic age and you play them until the game ends at 1821. Everything is historically based and of course there are hundreds of countries to pick from meaning you'll spend hours and hours of this game just playing a new and different country each time. Each game length varies, but I'd say at least a full twenty four hours each if you really immerse yourself. Every single experience for each country is not the same, as most countries have unique ideas that affect the way you play each country, and they all aren't equally powerful, meaning different approaches and strategies have to be used in order to be successful. Want to change history? You could save Constantinople from the Turks and restore the Roman Empire, or you could even take over Britain as Ireland. The possibilities are endless. Downsides? Not much, however the game and UI can be overwhelming to some at first.","January 27, 2014","true","224.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","1"

Found that the updates to the game completely unbalanced the game. I rather like to play as micronations struggling to survive against the odds, I get that's hard, that's why I like it. But the updates have made this completely impossible, not playing as an already large nation is asking for a screwjob. I'd like to compare that frustration to Dark Souls (I have it on console) but at least Dark Souls has a strategy too it that can help you overcome the odds, this is just asinine. Worst off I've tried to reset the game to versions such as 1.11.4 and 1.12.2, the earliest versions that supported the El Dorado DLC and not the recent updates, they crashed every time I started a game. Uninstalled, no question about it I have no reason to continue playing this game. I'm just happy I got my moneys worth out of it before all this happened.\n\nIf you want details about the updates themselves they go as follows:\n\nProvinces instantly fall if they do not have a fort, putting a strain on your forces to constantly recapture them if you are doing anything more than chasing down one enemy army.\nBuildings (such as forts) have over doubled in costs, costs micronations I like to play as cannot afford. There seems to be no boost to cash flow.\nEach province with a fort costs 1 gold to maintain, in large nations that adds up quickly in small nations that puts you in debt.\nI'm not honestly sure what else they added, I saw this and I was pretty much done. Military conquest was supposed to be engaging, difficult, and rewarding not a pointlessly frustrating hassle.\n","March 28","false","190.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","12"

After over 2000 hours of creating Byzantine Australia, Austrian Africa ect.ect. playing EUIV was difficult.  So much had changed since the days of Divine Wind.  No more policy sliders, more confusing (now much simpler after getting used to it) trade, more historical constraints and no "minting".  However...EUIV is by far, a fantastic game.  Many of the problems EUIII had have been fixed, such as a better way of forming personal unions.  Yes, it isn't as easy to destroy the Ottamans with the remenants of the Roman Empire like in EUIII, but by the pentriach it is much more satisfying for being so.  Every nation feels a little more unique due to ideas and the game flows beautifully.  Even colonization doesn't feel as much as a hassle, though changing religions is a pain in my imperial breeches.  To any EUIII fans that have not played IV yet, get it.  Because while its so different, its a wonderful different and after a while, you don't want to go back.\n\nTo newcomers to the series I say several things.\n\n1) You will never stop thinking about this game once you start playing.  Strategies will come into your head even when your not playing it.\n2) This is nothing like Civ.  You won't get anywhere by comparing the two, except for realising you would have more spare time if you played Civ.  A civ game is a few seconds long compared to this.\n3) You will most likely live the rest of your life alone due to points 1 and 2 and only just remember to feed yourself.\n\nSo good luck and have fun!\n\n10/10, can't wait for the new expansion.","September 14, 2014","true","238.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

First released almost two years ago back in August 2013, the game continues to receive regular updates and instalments in the form of DLCs, the most recent of which - Common Sense - was released in June 2015. Starting in the year 1444 and ending in 1821, the game gives you the chance to rule any nation in the world during the era of Colonisation, when the nations of Europe explored the world in search of new land and riches.\n\nThis review will focus predominantly on Gameplay due to how important it is to the game, but because of the word limit I will not be able to cover everything.\n\nGameplay\n\nIn the game, you are given control of any country you choose throughout the world, in any time period between 1444-1821. Being a grand strategy, there are a lot of things to focus on. One of the most central features of Europa Universalis IV is technology, which you must upgrade throughout the course of the game by generating and spending points (commonly referred to as monarch points), which are gained each month in-game and are split into three areas: Administration, Diplomacy and Military. Points are generated based on the skills of your leader and your leaders advisors, who cost gold (in-game ducats) to employ, but along with generating points can also give other bonus modifiers to your nation. You are given the ability to focus on a specific area if you deem it necessary, at the cost of losing points in the other categories.\n\nTechnology is split into the same three categories as the points, and have up to thirty-two levels. As you progress, being ahead in technology gives you bonuses over other nations in the game, at the cost of the next technology level costing more because you're ahead of time. Being ahead in technology, as well as other things, contributes towards your Game Score, which merely gives you a ranking to see how well you're performing in comparison to other nations.\n\nWhere you start geographically in the game decides your nation's technology group, of which there are a few. The further away you move from Europe, upgrading your technology costs more monarch points, which means it takes longer. As a balance however, the lower your technology group, the more monarch points you can generate and store. When playing as a non-Western nation, you have the ability to 'Westernize' once you border a Western nation, on the condition that you're behind on at least seven levels of technology.\n\nAfter reaching the fifth level of Administrative Technology, you can unlock an Idea Group in one of the three main areas of Administration, Diplomacy and Military, which you can progress along by spending monarch points. Every nation in the game starts out with National Ideas, which give extra bonus modifiers to your nation and can be unlocked through completing ideas in Idea Groups. Once Idea Groups are completed, some can be paired together to set National Policies, which can give you extra bonus modifiers at the cost of a single monarch point in that policy's key area (e.g. an Administrative policy costs you one Administrative point monthly in-game to maintain).\n\nThere are many other things you will have to spend your monarch points on, so spend them wisely.\n\nThere are other points which you will have to focus on: Stability, Prestige and Legitimacy and Power Projection. Stability is the overall strength of your nation, and if it is positive, that will give bonuses to your nation. If it is in the negative, it will give penalties. Prestige is how noteworthy you are, and has the same impact as Stability. Legitimacy is the strength of your ruler; the less Legitimacy your ruler has, the less authority they have. Power Projection is how imposing you are towards other nations, and this depends on how active you are against your nation’s Rivals, which you can choose throughout the game.\n\nAlongside all of this, you will have the help of various invisible individuals who you can send around on various tasks. You will have Diplomats who you use to improve relations and form alliances, or even fabricate claims and declare war on nations. You will have Merchants which you use to steer trade and collect trade from various nodes, and Missionaries to help convert land. A key feature of the game can be utilised through Colonists, who – once unlocked – can be sent to colonise regions like the Americas and Africa.\n\nFinally, you must build your armies independently (based on Infantry, Cavalry and later Cannons) and hire generals to lead them. Navies are also built independently, with various units built for specific purposes. Provinces can be improved with various buildings that grant bonuses, and the more Development a province has the more buildings you can build in them. Random events will occur from time to time, which can either have positive or negative effects depending on what decision you pick. Considering all of this – and other aspects I haven’t even covered – I’d recommend that players take a good long while to explore the mechanics of the game before becoming too ambitious in their aims, particularly as the User Interface does have a few hidden yet incredibly important pieces of information players should keep an eye on.\n\nGraphics and Sound\n\nThe world map is displayed beautifully, and features many useful and varying map modes to give you all the information you might need to digest from just a quick glance. Decorated with beautiful terrain and sprites, it’s easy to spend hours just surveying the map without any in-game time actually passing. The soundtrack is also quite enjoyable to listen to, and in Paradox’s usual style of thinking outside of the box, the addition of heavy metal music to the soundtrack makes playing the game even more enjoyable, if not just for the music itself.\n\nThree Pros and Cons\n\nPros:\n\n+ Perfect for fans of history, and a must have grand strategy for any armchair general or wannabe dictator.\n\n+ Every game is unique, so you can play again and again with many different outcomes.\n\n+ Workshop-supported; community content gives the game even more replay value.\n\nCons:\n\n- Hard learning curve; in-built game tutorial is severely lacking.\n\n- The User Interface can be incredibly overwhelming at first, and a lot of crucial numbers and modifiers are hidden in the tool tips with no obvious pointers as to where they are.\n\n- Certain features depend on whether the player owns a particular DLC, which narrows down the possibilities with the base game.\n\nConclusion\n\nEuropa Univeralis IV is the physical definition of Grand Strategy; limitless possibilities await you as you lead your chosen nation to a glorious future. Whether you follow history or change it is up to you, and the goals of the game are your own. A definite must-have, the game will have you hooked for hours and is a momentous challenge, but I can guarantee you that it will not be a waste of time.","August 5, 2015","true","179.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The soundtrack is also quite enjoyable to listen to, and in Paradox’s usual style of thinking outside of the box, the addition of heavy metal music to the soundtrack makes playing the game even more enjoyable, if not just for the music itself.\n\nThree Pros and Cons\n\nPros:\n\n+ Perfect for fans of history, and a must have grand strategy for any armchair general or wannabe dictator.\n\n+ Every game is unique, so you can play again and again with many different outcomes.\n\n+ Workshop-supported; community content gives the game even more replay value.\n\nCons:\n\n- Hard learning curve; in-built game tutorial is severely lacking.\n\n- The User Interface can be incredibly overwhelming at first, and a lot of crucial numbers and modifiers are hidden in the tool tips with no obvious pointers as to where they are.\n\n- Certain features depend on whether the player owns a particular DLC, which narrows down the possibilities with the base game.\n\nConclusion\n\nEuropa Univeralis IV is the physical definition of Grand Strategy; limitless possibilities await you as you lead your chosen nation to a glorious future. Whether you follow history or change it is up to you, and the goals of the game are your own. A definite must-have, the game will have you hooked for hours and is a momentous challenge, but I can guarantee you that it will not be a waste of time.","August 5, 2015","true","179.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

In short, the three major expansion have fixed most of the issues with the game, and added a massive amount of extra content and flavour.\n\nReview:\n\nAn improvement over the already excellent 'EU3: Divine Wind' in almost every way imaginable.\n\n- For those interested in the genre, this is probably the best place to start: Excellent tutorials (by Paradox's standards, at least), less unnecessary abstraction, but all the depth of a PDS game. You'll still fail miserably a few times before fully figuring the game out, but that's always been part of the fun in these titles.\n\nSo ye, if you're new to grand strategy, get this.\n\n- As for 'us' veterans? Improved mechanics across the board, trading that makes sense, more challenging AI and Ironman mode make this a worthy sequel to EU3.\n\nThe biggest change from EU3DW is the monarch point system that replaces the budget sliders and magistrates. A welcome change, in my opinion, as now you can't just adjust your sliders a bit in the early game for high stability and fast military tech. Monarch points are used for national ideas, tech, buildings, national decisions, even peace treaties.\n\nThe highly limited amount of monarch points earned per month force the player to really think about his actions. No more spamming buildings at max magistrates and never touching the sliders.\n\nThis system does have slight balance issues: military tech is always a better investment than military ideas, for example, and the fact that your ruler's skills play a major part in your monarch point income can screw over large portions of a playthrough. Fall behind in military tech because of an idiot king?\nlol ok, Prussia is going  to eat you now.\n\nOther small problems include the infrequent revolutions and apparent ultra-stability of large AI nations. In my three finished campaigns, [strikethrough]only a handful of American nations ever managed to gain independence, and I've never seen a Revolutionary France. Small sample size, yes, but it does seem like large empires are a bit too stable at the moment.[/strikethrough] These happen far more often now. Colonial nations revolt quite often and the revolution mechanic makes seeing revolutionary nations far more common.\n\nThe UI is much better this time, being closer to CK2's than EU3's, but the panels and the font are still far too small at 1920x1080. Fortunately, there is a fix to this in the Steam workshop, another great addition to the game.\n\nAI has seen quite a few improvements as well, especially in diplomacy. Every nation now has a limited amount of diplomatic relations they can maintain, and the AI does seem to understand the mechanic quite well, cutting ties with nations because of shifting interests, and seeking new allies as the game progresses (instead of picking 3 allies at the start of the game and sticking with them, like in EU3).\n\nCascading alliances are not a problem anymore, as infamy was replaced by an aggressive expansion relations hit to all nearby nations. AE going too high leads to the AI forming coalitions: defensive alliances that do what cascading alliances were supposed to.\n\nOverall, the AI nations seem far better at waging war; effectively pursuing hostile armies, splitting up to siege multiple provinces at a time, exploiting river crossings to crush larger forces, etc.\n\nEU4 > EU3  Divine Wind. [strikethrough]Only thing I actually miss from EU3 are the overseas territory names (ie. Portuguese Africa, British Caribbean)[/strikethrough] Conquest of Paradise adds this back in.\n\n- How is it as a standalone title?\n\nA bloody brilliant game, and miles above any non-PDS strategy game in depth, scale and complexity. It also looks very pretty, so that's good.\n\nI was a long-time Total War fan, before being introduced to EU3. Now, even Empire: Total War feels far to simplistic.\n\nExpansions:\n\nThe Conquest of Paradise\n\n- Colonial nations form when you have enough colonies in an overseas region. Similar to vassals, but pay tariffs instead of taxes. A pretty cool mechanic, though I do miss being able to micromanage every single colony.\n- Randomized New World. Not too exciting. Terrain generation is really odd, and looks like a random map seed from Age of Empires 2.\n\nThe Wealth of Nations\n\n- Revamped trade system is great.\n- Trade companies are like colonial nations in the East. Cool system, but has the same problems CN's have.\n- New diplomacy options are great. Transfering trade power, new casus belli. Great additions.\n\nRes Publica\n\n- More flavour for Poland and the Dutch. Not too exciting, but highly recommended if you want to play those nations.\n\nArt of War\n\n- More diplomacy options again. Excellent additions like supporting rebel CB, fight for subject CB, war reparations.\n- Autonomy system added in the patch is great, as is the new revolution mechanic.","August 24, 2013","true","263.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

A lot of cool content was removed and replaced by something that's not very interesting or not replaced at all. Sure we are probably going to get a lot of stuff in thousand DLCs ($$$), but I am judging EUIV in current form and not form which may eventually appear. EUIII beats EUIV in almost every aspect. Main difference is that EUIV is more "clear". Interface is improved, you can check a lot of stuff that you couldn't before, like who will join your enemy war or if certain nation will or will not accept your offer. Micromanagment is also improved as you can now build units, buildings and much more under one tab.\n\nWhat I dislike?\n\n- Removed sliders which were adding a lot diversity to the game\n\n- Trade system that required constant attention and only fully trade focused nations could be competetive in multiplayer games was changed into something that works passively in the background. Trade routes are cool, but new trade system is extremly boring and doesn't require much of your attention (compared to old system)\n\n- No profit from being small. In EUIII small nations could be a lot more advance than large nations because technology cost was based on size of country and income. Small nations also could be as good as large nations in trade or much, much better while in EU4 being larger always means being better in all aspects.\n\n- Nation specific ideas - really bad idea. Just adds unnecessary/unfair bonuses to some nations while some other nations are left completly screwed by useless national ideas\n\n- Ideas - EUIII ideas offered much more combinations which resulted in much more events and possible decisions often allowing you to turn your nation into extremly specific direction. You won't find such possibilities in EUIV. For example you will be forced to spend your monarch points into naval oriented ideas if you want to have all land military ideas etc. Just stupid..\n\n- Monarch Points. Cool idea, too bad there is nothing you can do to affect how good will be your monarch. You can affect your points "income" in total, but you cannot change points income from ruler stats, it's based on pure rng.\n\n- Revolts are just insanely overpowered. Thousands upon thousands of rebels can pop out at the same time,  overwhelming your entire army. At least avoiding them is quite easy.\n\n- Many other cool mechanics removed: sphere of influence, hidden decisions, personal unions (exsist but in extremly marginalized state)\n\nI can write much more but I don't think there is need for that. For people that loved depth of EUIII, it was clearly superior games over this "sequel". If you prefer more casual approach, EUIV it's perfect game for you. It's defiately much easier to understand because there is not that many hidden mechanics that you have to know about compared to EUIII.","March 1, 2015","false","256.9"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PatrioticPlatypus/recommended/236850/","PatrioticPlatypus","PatrioticPlatypus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PatrioticPlatypus/","362 products in account","If you are in general a fan of war, history, strategy, trade or Europe, or more specifically European warfare, the strategy of European warfare, the history of the strategy of European warfare, or especially the history of the strategy of European warfare, politics, trade and nationhood during the Age of Exploration, this game should pique your interest. To get a taste of the game, I'll just tell you what happened in my last campaign:\n\nAfter conquering the Zapotecs and Mayans over the course of a century long series of conflicts, the Aztec Empire experienced a golden age of peace and prosperity where mountains of wealth were stored away for future use. This all ended when the European powers suddenly colonized and cornered the Empire on both sides: the Portuguese to the south at the Yucatan and the Norwegian to the north on the Gulf of Mexico. Immediately Portugal attacked. To prevent its eminent destruction by a more technologically advanced nation, the Empire converted to Catholicism, became Defender of the Faith, westernized and went to war with the Protestant heathens to the north. Over the course of three wars with Norway, the Empire successfully converted its people to the new religion and actually obtained more influence in the Papal Curia than Portugal had. Despite the Aztecs conquering Protestant territory up to the mouth of the Mississippi, successfully converting the entire country to Catholicism, and having good trade relations and national reputation with Portugal, the Portuguese eventually attacked again, sacked Tenochtitlan, bankrupted the Empire and stole away the Yucatan peninsula from its rightful owners. It seems that in the trifecta of war (God, Glory and Greed) Greed has been and always will trump what is religiously right.\n\nIf you learn anything from that it should be playing non-European countries is hard. But even on the hardest difficulty, this game is very fun and will result in some amazing stories.\n\nAlso! If you do decide to buy this game, please don't forget to play with the music on. The soundtrack will make you feel much more badass when you play. Trust me.","December 23, 2013","true","64.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With a variety of a new features mounted on a brand new Clausewitz 2.0 engine the game is much more smoother and less clunkier in most aspects, having streamlined alot of the chores into a simple click of a button. Detaching for a siege,Patrolling,rebel supression etc is just a click of a button away as compared to EU3 where you had to manually detach men for a siege for example.\n\nAs the name might suggest,the scale is colossal spanning 7 conintents and 5 oceans (barring Antartica) the world is your playground. There is no clearly defined objective or motive , it is all up to you ,the player. Playing as England you can try to beat france in the hundred years war and rewrite history. If your a fan of the Romans, you can try to restore the roman empire. Take the balkans back from the ottomans and push them out of asia minor,maybe expand into western europe and reconquer the city of Rome. You can even explore a randomized new world with the Conquest of Paradise Expansion. The possibilities are endless.\n\nHowever,as with any games,there are definitely bugs and flaws. The Protectecrate System as of now is essentially useless,they do not fight in battles and only give you trade power. Your Protectecrates system to benefit more off you than you do off them. Colonial Nations are abit buggy as well,other colonial nations can declalre war on your colonial nation without even calling you to arms, so if for example a 20 province colony of portugal declares war on a 5 province colony of yours,you can not do anything except watch them eat your colony up unless miracously they win that war.There are still many more bugs which i have not pointed out. but you get the idea\n\nThat being said though Europa Universalis 4 is still definitely worth getting , it's replayability value is practically endless and if you have Crusader Kings 2 and the CK2 to EUIV converter , you can start a game in CK2 and Continue all the way to the end of EU4 and maybe even Victoria If there is a converter.\n\n9/10 Rating\n","February 2, 2014","true","141.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you have a thirst for world domination and do not like people to tell you how to get there, then this game is for you!\n\nYou get so many avenues of approach it will become a whole thesis just to list them all. It's about building your country, keeping your friends close and enemies closer, its about building up your army and staying ahead in technology, so that your armies get that edge they deserve! Its about the buildup to the perfect coup de gras.\n\nOne thing this game does well if to present choices without dumming down the mechanics, in fact it is my experience that with new expansions they ad or expand on gamemechanics making the game more and more immersive, and thus giving the player even more ways to move ahead. This means however that the game has a steep learning curve for new players. You can expect to spend the first 10 or so hours to get a good grip of the basics and still have trouble beating your larger neighours. But the satifaction when you first manage to take down France is immense!\nTo help you, there is a very good and fleshed out wikipage, that for the most part gets updated almost instantly after new expansions gets released.\n\nFor me, and this is the reason ive reached this many hours on the game, is multiplayer. Going into multiplayer with friends or finding players through the paradox forums, will add a whole new game experience to the mix. Every area of the game gets improved, war, diplomacy etc. The multiplayer part does have a few problems though, as with most paradox games, the game can get unstable after a while, and out of sync problems can and will happen. Slower computers or computers with unstable or slow internetconnection will also present a problem, but can for the most part be solved with slowing down gametime.\n\nI recommend this game because there are so many fun hours to be had. Because the way you want to play it, is entirely left up to the player, and because Paradox seens genuinly interested in improving upon this game with its now many expansions.","December 20, 2013","true","580.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is epic in scale and depth, with literally an entire world to explore over three of the most dynamic centuries in history. It manages to create a completely believable world that pays homage to the forces that have shaped history while simultaneously giving you the opportunity and tools to reshape it in anyway you please.\n\nThe sheer number of features and mechanics at work can be a bit overwhelming. The interface certainly takes some getting used to as you are inundated with bewildering amounts of information. However, as you gradually learn to master these features and mechanics, you crave every bit of scrumptious data as your actions both affact and are dictated by then. This is a refreshing stand against the plethora of games that continously dumb down in order to appeal to mass audiences.\n\nThe real weakness in this game is suggested in the name. While the European playthroughs are as fleshed out and fun as you would expect, those in other regions of the world are noticeably less so. Certainly, the developer is slowly working to address this problem. Through patches and expansions, places like East Asia and the Americas will become more fully developed with more nations and features. Still, the general focus on Europe hurts the otherwise immersive game experience.\n\nCompletely recomended for strategy gamers, cartophiles, and lovers of history. 9/10","January 22, 2014","true","180.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Europa Universalis III was one of my favorite strategy games and easily my favorite Paradox game, and EU4 is an improvement across the board, a strictly better game in every way it's different. A much improved interface, far easier to understand at a glance, and way more interesting strategic decisions to make at any given moment. EU4 is without caveat good enough to legitimately stand toe to toe with the Civilizations and Total Wars of the world. I can feel secure saying that this is probably going to be the best strategy gaming experience to be had all year, in a year Brave New World came out and Rome 2 is coming out.

PICK THIS UP.\n\nI've played Paradox games for a little while now, and aside from some small bugs (there is a ton going on in this game) it is the best I have played so far. Don't be discouraged by the steep learning curve. Find a friend who also has this game and ask him questions. They've steadily been patching the bugs and improving game-play balance.\n\nIronman mode adds a nice wrinkle to the game, but it is not for the faint-hearted. It is also the only way to unlock the Steam Achievements. It also can make the game very painful by not only setting the difficulty for you, but also only allowing one save game that auto-saves every single month. The auto-save is slightly annoying as it doesn't seem to be very optimized, but it is a nuisance I'm willing to deal with for those achievements.\n\n\nIf you just want to dominate the world, you can change the bonus levels, turn down difficulty, cheat, or essentially do whatever you want to make the game enjoyable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/weedbobbie/recommended/236850/","weedbobbie","Petrosin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/weedbobbie/","64 products in account","One of the best Paradox creations of all time. While for experienced in RTS games players it is noob-friendly, it can be actually quite confusing and complicated for new comers to understand the concept and purpose of all the factors included. As the name of the game says, it's mainly concentrated in Europe as the timeline in the game goes from the years 1444-1821. The game adapts many features and it's very comfortable for the user to actually control everything, the simulation of economy, war and diplomacy is really well done and there are many unique features and events that could help you even more. While there is a tutorial, for the new-comers it won't be the best of help. The game is purely built on historical map (almost entirely correct) and after you pick a date and begin with a country, you can change the concept of history entirely.\n\nAlthough mentioned that the war mechanics were good, they aren't exactly ideal. or sometimes realistic. There aren't any really factors that influence the combat other than the terrain, manpower and.. some rolling dice. You can accept it as a kind of a chance game or even gambling. The diplomacy branch is good on the other side. There are special points - Administrative, Military and Diplomatic points and each of them have their sole purpose. I won't go exactly in detail about them, but there are special 'people' - Diplomats, Merchants, Missionaries and so on. This is the mechanic I really like, as it's a defining point of the game and it can perform many actions. Another factor is the monarch (or the ruler), and he's a pretty valuable in the game too. There are many skipped parts but this is the main look of the game and its welcoming to the people.\n\nTL;DR: Like Strategy? Like History? This is the game for you.

Being a grand strategy game virtually every aspect of your country is up to you such as trade, internal conflicts, war, manufacturing and more.\n\nYou begin by choosing any possible country existing betwen the years of 1444-1821. Japan, Spain, the Ottomans and more are all options and all have different gameplay mechanics. You may choose to try to unite the Holy Roman Empire as Austria,  conquer the seas and trade as the Netherlands, rule the new world as Spain or Portugal or simply take over the world. As time goes on you collect Monarch Points whch can be spent to improve technology or take idea groups to help your country excel in different aspects.\n\nOne of the main goals in EU4 is taking over the world (or at least carving out a little piece of it for yourself). This is personally one of my favorite parts of the game as it is very different from games such as civiization. Politics are deeply involved and alliances, vassals and other factors come in to play. Furthermore different war justifications can be used (casus bellis) which allow different goals and outcomes for the war as well as different effects on your neighbours. Combat itself can be compared to Risk. The player does not take part in battlefield tactics, but with the careful positioning of different armies and aquisition of military technology and ideas can win the war for you. In that way it is quite a bit deeper then Risk.\n\nThe player can also turn towards more diplomatic solutions for growth. Managing a navy to take a larger part in trade, colonizing the new world or marrying into other royal families are all examples. Trade specifically is set to be improved with the up coming "Wealth of Nations" expansion. These aspects all require your attention to help your country flourish and have various mechanics to amke them fun and satisfying.\n\nHowever there are particular downisdes. One being the steep learning curve. If you rush into the game like I did you may feel overwhelmed by the plethora of buttons and menus. This is expected being a grand strategy game. However don't give up. There are in game tutorials as well as amny online ones. Furthermore most buttons and figures displayed contain tool tips to explain their meaning. After a few hours of play you should be able to have  basic understanding of the game. Once you make it past you can find a deep and satisfying experience. Be prepared for failure though.\n\nAnother aspect may be that of balance. The game is not meant to give an equal difficulty experience to each country to imitate history. If you play as a 1st Nations tribe youll find yourself falling behind on technology and with inferior units. I would recommened beginning with a western powerful nation (France, Castile,) and moving on to others for a challenge.\n\nIn summary if you can get past the learning curve this game is loads of fun and great for any strategy lovers.","March 25, 2014","true","203.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you have a thirst for world domination and do not like people to tell you how to get there, then this game is for you!\n\nYou get so many avenues of approach it will become a whole thesis just to list them all. It's about building your country, keeping your friends close and enemies closer, its about building up your army and staying ahead in technology, so that your armies get that edge they deserve! Its about the buildup to the perfect coup de gras.\n\nOne thing this game does well if to present choices without dumming down the mechanics, in fact it is my experience that with new expansions they ad or expand on gamemechanics making the game more and more immersive, and thus giving the player even more ways to move ahead. This means however that the game has a steep learning curve for new players. You can expect to spend the first 10 or so hours to get a good grip of the basics and still have trouble beating your larger neighours. But the satifaction when you first manage to take down France is immense!\nTo help you, there is a very good and fleshed out wikipage, that for the most part gets updated almost instantly after new expansions gets released.\n\nFor me, and this is the reason ive reached this many hours on the game, is multiplayer. Going into multiplayer with friends or finding players through the paradox forums, will add a whole new game experience to the mix. Every area of the game gets improved, war, diplomacy etc. The multiplayer part does have a few problems though, as with most paradox games, the game can get unstable after a while, and out of sync problems can and will happen. Slower computers or computers with unstable or slow internetconnection will also present a problem, but can for the most part be solved with slowing down gametime.\n\nI recommend this game because there are so many fun hours to be had. Because the way you want to play it, is entirely left up to the player, and because Paradox seens genuinly interested in improving upon this game with its now many expansions.","December 20, 2013","true","580.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To get a taste of the game, I'll just tell you what happened in my last campaign:\n\nAfter conquering the Zapotecs and Mayans over the course of a century long series of conflicts, the Aztec Empire experienced a golden age of peace and prosperity where mountains of wealth were stored away for future use. This all ended when the European powers suddenly colonized and cornered the Empire on both sides: the Portuguese to the south at the Yucatan and the Norwegian to the north on the Gulf of Mexico. Immediately Portugal attacked. To prevent its eminent destruction by a more technologically advanced nation, the Empire converted to Catholicism, became Defender of the Faith, westernized and went to war with the Protestant heathens to the north. Over the course of three wars with Norway, the Empire successfully converted its people to the new religion and actually obtained more influence in the Papal Curia than Portugal had. Despite the Aztecs conquering Protestant territory up to the mouth of the Mississippi, successfully converting the entire country to Catholicism, and having good trade relations and national reputation with Portugal, the Portuguese eventually attacked again, sacked Tenochtitlan, bankrupted the Empire and stole away the Yucatan peninsula from its rightful owners. It seems that in the trifecta of war (God, Glory and Greed) Greed has been and always will trump what is religiously right.\n\nIf you learn anything from that it should be playing non-European countries is hard. But even on the hardest difficulty, this game is very fun and will result in some amazing stories.\n\nAlso! If you do decide to buy this game, please don't forget to play with the music on. The soundtrack will make you feel much more badass when you play. Trust me.","December 23, 2013","true","64.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The systems for the standard Military, Diplomacy, and Administrative aspects of leading a nation in a strategy game like this are all very robust, and challenge you to divide your resources and be the most effective ruler you can be. It is incredibly satisfying to change the course of world history through hard work and practice. A bit of a learning curve but in my first game I was able to become the most powerful nation in central europe by 1800.","April 14, 2014","true","602.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kgambit/recommended/236850/","kgambit","kgambit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kgambit/","29 products in account","Europa Universalis IV is a global grand strategy game covering the period from 1444 to 1820.  The game is complex and rich in detail.  It offers extensive replayability not only in the choice of nations (from the great nations of Europe or Asia, a small merchant state or a american / meso-american tribe) but the strategic path you take to build your empire. You can start with a great power such as France or England and carve a path of conquest thru Europe, or start  with a small merchant state and expand thru trade. Choose Spain and build an empire by colonizing the New World (and Africa and Asia), or perhaps start as the Incas and conquer meso-america.  The gameplay choices are endless.\n\n\nThe game does have a fairly steep learning curve and requires a fair amount of micro managing to build and maintain your empire.  You'll need to build relations, create alliances, establish colonies, protect your trade, create vassals, suppress revolts, arrange royal marriages, research different techologies, establish national policies and embark on military conquests while calling on your allies for support (and cursing them when they tell you to get lost).  And that's just a small sample of the myriad of decisions.\n\n\nThere is a lot of DLC available for the game.  Each expansion release coincides with a game update that introduces free new mechanics while the expansion expands those mechanics with additional features.  While the base game remains playable without the expansions, the full impact of the new mechanics is lost without the expansions.  That's  subjective and a matter of personal taste.  Additional DLC in the form of unit, portrait and song packs are simply a matter of choice.\n\n\nOf all of Paradox's strategy games, this one is probably my favorite.  The incredible detail and broad range of options make this a must have for anyone who enjoys strategy games.   If micro-managing isn't your cup of tea, then give the game a wide berth.\n\nAs you can see from my accumulated playtime (1,288 hrs) the game can be really addictive","July 18, 2015","true","288.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Pretty open and the criteria for "Victory" in most cases lies in what YOU define as as a win. So if that's military conquest or diplomatic annexation you can do that. Hell; you can spend the entire game doing nothing but trading, only warring for your economic interests.\n\nIt's a really magnificent game and something I'd assuredly reccomend picking up at your convienance. It goes on 50-75% sales almost  every sale as well as every time a major DLC come outs. Is you'd like an in-depth look at the game consider looking up people like Arumba or Shenryyr on youtube; they produce quite alot of content on EU4.","December 20, 2014","true","260.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Next to EUIV, the arguably most popular strategy game around, Civ V, is strategy for 4-year olds.\n\nHaving played this after investing hundreds of hours in Crusader Kings II, it really feels "right". While CK2 focused more on the individual characters, with a lot of rich RPG-like elements and a lot of intrigue and diplomacy, EUIV takes a more high-level approach, that really works to its benefit.\n\nIt's not an extremely easy game to get into to, but it's not as difficult to "learn as you go" as you might think. Overall, I think it's the more accessible of the EU series thus far.\n\nThe sheer amount of content and possibilities in this game makes it worth to play again and again, in ever more challenging scenarios and starting nations. No two games will ever be alike, even with the same starting conditions.\n\nIn terms of actual gameplay, success hangs in managing the fine balance of resources, diplomacy and opportunities that arise. It's tough, but fair. It never really feels like you're losing for no good reason. The AI is aggressive and will exploit your weaknesses, but there's always a way around it, even if you only realize it when it's already too late. It feels real, like something that would've happened in real life.\n\nTo sum it up, buy it and play the heck out of it. Get CK2 while you're at it, too. They are both amazing games, that really complement each other really well. It's my favorite pair of strategy games.\n\n","June 15, 2014","true","67.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With a variety of a new features mounted on a brand new Clausewitz 2.0 engine the game is much more smoother and less clunkier in most aspects, having streamlined alot of the chores into a simple click of a button. Detaching for a siege,Patrolling,rebel supression etc is just a click of a button away as compared to EU3 where you had to manually detach men for a siege for example.\n\nAs the name might suggest,the scale is colossal spanning 7 conintents and 5 oceans (barring Antartica) the world is your playground. There is no clearly defined objective or motive , it is all up to you ,the player. Playing as England you can try to beat france in the hundred years war and rewrite history. If your a fan of the Romans, you can try to restore the roman empire. Take the balkans back from the ottomans and push them out of asia minor,maybe expand into western europe and reconquer the city of Rome. You can even explore a randomized new world with the Conquest of Paradise Expansion. The possibilities are endless.\n\nHowever,as with any games,there are definitely bugs and flaws. The Protectecrate System as of now is essentially useless,they do not fight in battles and only give you trade power. Your Protectecrates system to benefit more off you than you do off them. Colonial Nations are abit buggy as well,other colonial nations can declalre war on your colonial nation without even calling you to arms, so if for example a 20 province colony of portugal declares war on a 5 province colony of yours,you can not do anything except watch them eat your colony up unless miracously they win that war.There are still many more bugs which i have not pointed out. but you get the idea\n\nThat being said though Europa Universalis 4 is still definitely worth getting , it's replayability value is practically endless and if you have Crusader Kings 2 and the CK2 to EUIV converter , you can start a game in CK2 and Continue all the way to the end of EU4 and maybe even Victoria If there is a converter.\n\n9/10 Rating\n","February 2, 2014","true","141.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
