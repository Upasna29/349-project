I'll try to make this short and sweet.\n\nThis particular version of the game:\n\n+ Includes both of the expansion packs. The description doesn't mention it, but both Core Contingency and Battle Tactics are here.\n+ Includes the map editor.\n+ Supports resolutions up to 1920x1200, though I find that the game looks and plays better after bumping it down a few notches.\n+ Seems to run perfectly on Windows 10.\n+ Is good old version 3.1, combatible with countless fan-made maps and mods. There are probably thousands of extra units available to add on to this game, though the game has a cap of allowing ~230 custom additional units to be installed at one time.\n- Does not include any updated multiplayer lobbies or functionalty.\n- Does not currently support the Steam overlay.\n\nIf you're not familiar with the game itself, go read a real review.

Looking back to the late 90s and the technology available then, this game was amazingly advanced and did many things that weren't at all common then. Many common RTS elements that are expected in a game released today can be seen in their youth in TA. The order queuing system, the streaming resource and building systems, the diversity of units and asymmetrical factions are all key features that were later used in practically every RTS since. You can clearly see the foundation of Supreme Commander especially. There are aspects of TA that still haven’t been matched, such as the unit diversity: Air, Land, Sea, Seaplane, Hovercraft, Amphibious.\n\nLike artillery? How about the Intimidator, which can fire halfway across the map? Too slow? Build the Buzzsaw: a giant rotary cannon made up of Intimidators that fires as fast as a machine gun and will drain your energy economy in seconds. Yes, it IS the most entertaining gun ever!\n\nThe music of TA is the best orchestral soundtrack ever made for a game. I still sometimes listen to the "battle" tracks in my car. I turn the music off in every other game I’ve played and listen to “real” music instead (I remember listening to Spice Girls on a CD while playing), but TA got to keep its soundtrack.\n\nI think a large part of what made TA such a fun and long lasting experience was the modding community. I remember spending as much time finding, downloading (V.90 modem, yo), and figuring out conflicts between mods as playing the game, but those mods extended the diversity and playability of the game so extensively that there are still active players AND active modders for TA. You don’t see that with too many 19 year-old games.\n\nThe chief contender for the RTS throne was Starcraft, which was released right around the same time as TA, and went on to define the "twitch" RTS subgenre. Coming from Warcraft 2, I remember buying both games, and being rather disappointed in Starcraft, since it seemed to me to be "Warcraft in space". TA was something entirely new and captured that certain something that makes it a gaming classic... and I've probably spent more time in this game than any other, ever.","December 20, 2015","true","1.0"," 139 of 146 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","139","146","5","3"

The best way I can descrbe it would be to think of Skyrim without mods, then think of Skyrim with mods that's effectively TA in a nuthshell.\n\nOptions:\n\n+ The developers certainly had longevity in mind, you can adjust the resolution up to 1920 x 1080.\n+ Provides all the options you might expect from a game of this age, perhaps abit more.\n- On/Off only, you can't find a middle ground without adjusting the files directly.\n\nGameplay\n\n+ A map for everybody! - every map has something for everybody the metal maps provide infinite resources and lead to a fast-paced style game. In contrast low metal maps have you fighting over resources while slowly pushing your way into the enemy base. Maps on distant moons have you transporting units by air over impassable chasms or bombing your opponent into the dust.\n\n+ Play how you want - Many RTS games have a 'defined' stratergy TA has no such definition, you will encounter players who love the good old peepee rush or those whose sole purpose is to watch you squirm as they destroy your outlying extractors. You'll encounter the turtles naturally but the game provides you with all the nessesary tools to enact your stratergy and descimate others.\n\n- AI Pathfinding - As mentioned the pathfinding is horrible and will almost certainly require fixing especially if you want to play Skirmish thankfully their are mods and simple scripts to fix this.\n\n- Performance - Most modern day PC's won't have a problem until like Skyrim you hit a point where your computer begins to chug along. This tends to arise from heavily modded games especially when you start to up the unit cap from 200 to 1000+\n\nCommunity:\n\n+ Still going strong not much else to say here besides the fact you have over 10 years of mods to discover some of which have been developed over so many years.","December 18, 2015","true","1.1"," 142 of 155 people (92%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","92","142","155","7","7"

It's the only accurate game I've ever seen about our future, where humans are all dead and the arm clones fight the core planetary mind for control of the universe.  They don't even care about being alive or anything, they just want to annihilate the other side so so much.  Sometimes a battle can take like 8 hours and just grind on, it takes so much willpower to keep going, or to even notice when you get nuked.  It's an endless battle.  It also has a great soundtrack written by Jeremy Seole, who wrote a lot of the music in Secret of Evermore.  The first time I saw Total Annihilation, I was in Circuit City and I saw this cool looking guy getting bombed by 50 fast moving fighters and planes and he couldn't stop the computer from killing him and he eventually lost his commander and then his last towers and the map went grey.  It was like 1997 or something and he must have been horrible at the game and I don't think either of us bought anything from circuit city that day, but to see that cool guy get annihilated by an endless wave of planes was shocking to me.  He said "damn it" or something like that and then looked at his watch and said "oh no" and then he ran away, I guess he had to go somewhere and was late.  I saw it as a great challenge to become as good as he was some day, and I still feel like I'm not, but objectively I must have met that challenge because I have won wars against 10 computer players with population limits in the thousands.  If I could go back in time, I would go back there, ask him if i could help, and save his base.","December 18, 2015","true","0.2"," 170 of 196 people (87%) found this review helpful 72 people found this review funny","87","170","196","72","13"

Here we are, at the end of 2015, and I can now play my favorite game of all time! There is a very good reason this game was 1997 game of the year and it wore that badge proudly on the sales box. So jump on board, I have hours of child hood that have NOT been wasted to prove how great Total Annihilation truly is.\n\nIf you liked Supreme Commander and/or Planetary Annihilation, I would highly recomend you check out the game that started it all. While it might seem a little dated, even to this day, it is still quite impressive. You see, this game was a first to do a lot of things. A true innovator. Not to mention the fantastic soundtrack, still being one of the best ever thanks to Jeremy Soule.\n\nYou should note that this download does come with both expansion packs: Battle Tactics and The Core Contingency. This is great news as the expansions have not worked on Windows without some kind of emulation since XP. I myself can finaly battle with a Krogoth, something I've not done for 7 odd years.\n\nMost people buying and downloading this game have probably already played it, so I will spare it a rating breakdown, though it would be just about perfect score. Instead I will point out a couple bugs that I've been getting so far. I will edit this review with fixes as they come along. Feel free to comment for patches, fixes, whatnots.\n\n-Everytime game launches it squishes all my windows desktop icons together.\n\n-Will tab out of game to windows desktop whenever a new screen is loaded in game. Game doesn't crash though, so that if mostly fine.\n\n-Can't side scroll at a widescreen resolution. Also not turly an issue in my mind, just changed the resolution to 1024x600\n\n-Sometimes construction units will drop their shift queues.\n\n-Seems like Steam Overlay might not be compatible?\n\nOther than that the game is still the masterpiece that it always has been and the under $4 asking price is chump coin.

Now OTA is here on Steam in all its glory! It wasnt Starcraft or Command & Conquer that set the bar for late 90s rts games. OTA is the undisputed and most refferenced old-school RTS that to this day inspires the finer qualities in the EPIC War genre we crave.\n\nIts important to note *though steam failed to mention it in the product details* This edition includes all DLC along with the main game (Original Total Annihilation, Core contengency Expansion, All of the Battle Tactics Expansions, Bonus Maps, Bonus Official Cavedog Units, Patch 3.1 known as the "No CD Patch" Patch 3.1 also is tweaked with the expanded unit cap which can be modified in the system files to a maximum of 5000 units per player in a 10 player battle. updated and fully supported multiplayer hosting for matches complete with thier own communities... The Added bennefit of the Steam Edition is access to the steam community for multiplayer compatibility. by comparison it is identical to the GOG edition with exception that the steam version has better compatibility with modern windows OS. Both copies work seamlessly with Wine if you use Linux or Mac. I reccomend the Steam edition for ease of gaming with friends. but the GOG.com version is DRM Free meaning you can buy one copy and then gift as many as you want to your friends per thier TOS agreement.\n\n-----Some useful details about the game not mentioned in the description-----\n\nMinor Bug: Due to this being a rather ancient game... there is an issue with the screen rendering of the game for flat screens which will cause a periodic flicker. Alt Tab didnt exist back then either so you should press the Windows key to minimise your game if you wish to chat with your steam buddies outside of the game. This however has an issue where the the screen will tweak out into odd colors... just minimize and maximize a couple times and the emulator steam uses to run the game will adjust and fix the issue pretty reliably. This is caused by the change in formatting for video displays after the flat screen transition.\n\nSome Extra Stuff:\n\nby default the multiplayer loby should have this enabled due to game additions added for both the GOG.com & Steam versions of the game. If you accidently shrink your lobby down or it appears as the old default of maximum of 4 players for skirmish and multi, simply press the 8 key on your keyboard followed by the roman numeral key from 2 to 10 indicating the max player matches. so 2 would be "8 ii" while 10 would be "8 x".\n\nto enter a "console code" while playing multiplayer or skirmish game modes simply press Enter and type + followed by the command. (The older versions of the game allowed some console commands to work in single player but the 3.1 patch made many commands nonfunctional or were removed all together. Many of these commands are now only availible within the develloper mode which you will need to download from TAUniverse & other fansites. It is possible to reinable them by editing the configuration files but the engine will not allow you to play multiplayer with other clients that have different files then you.)\n\nsome useful console commands are +gamma, +contour, & +showranges. These dont really break gameplay and fully function in all gamemodes, so enabling cheats to use these functions is ok if you agree with your gamemates that they can be used.\n\n+gamma lets you adjust the brightness of the screen "+gamma 8.5" was default for the old tube monitors... you can play around with this if you have lighting issues.\n\n+contour is useful for seeing the 3D terrain elivations and is highly useful as nobody back then had a concept of strategic zoom like what was introduced by Supreme Commander. +contour 5 is best i think as it still lets you view the pretty terrain features while letting you put that factory on the perfect spot easier. type +contour with no number to remove the elivation overlay. if you put a value in decimal that is less then one you will need to place a zero before the decimal for it to register... note this can cause framerate loss or artificial slowdown of the game for really minor details. in case of a game crash you will need to reinstall yourgame if you input values lower then 0.045.\n\n+showranges indicates the ranges of the various weapons on mobile units. it doesnt work on fixed fortifications which was fixed when they included the same feature in Supreme Commander. By default all units have an explosion range where they will harm other units within that range... and most units have 1 - 2 weapon ranges which might be off screen if its a long ranged weapon. some specdial units will by default have other indicators depending on functionality such as a cloak or stealth/jammer field that should be enabled by default.\n\na neat feature on the main menu is to type "dxdeath" which will enable or disable a Cavedog logo in the lower middle of the menuscreen. if you click that... in the old days it would allow you to view the credit screen... also while enabled it would allow you to manually pick missions rather then unlocking missions as you played.\n\n--another 2 codes that are neat but may become annoying for various reasons are +sing & +dither.\n\n+sing replaces the vehical sounds of units with a guy singing some nonsensical toon.\n\n+dither changes the gray scale of the out of view zones in the game to a "dithered" or bug-screen colored view. it looked great on the old analog tube monitors but causes major flickering issues on modern digital flatscreens. DO NOT USE THIS IF YOU HAVE EPILEPSY or are at risk for seizures or taking medications with this risk (regular gameplay on flatscreens however is completely safe)... there is no warning for this feature as this game predates those videogame warnings by like 10 years.","January 8","true","8.1"," 34 of 34 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","34","34","2","2"

I couldn't believe more people didn't know how intelligent its design was, how brilliant the waypointing and resource system were.  True, it is not a "hard counter" style of play like Starcraft; it is not a click-fest action-RTS hybrid where each unit has a special ability.  It is definitely hard-core RTS with many different build paths, a much deeper tech tree, and much larger armies that are still somehow easy to manage.  So many games and sequels (spiritual and direct) have tried to emulate the ease of play here, but they've all botched it up somehow.  True, it does somewhat boil down to a war of escalation, but it's damn fun every single time getting there.\n\nfor $5 I'd recommend this to anyone unless you really can't stand RTS games in general.","April 30","true","11.9"," 26 of 26 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","26","26","0","0"

Horraaayyy!\n\nGreat strategy game with an interesting resource system, tons of units, tons of missions and hours of fun to be had!\n\nWas ahead of its time in so many ways when it came out back in 1997 and it still has so much to offer, especially with the cheap price tag!  The expansions are also included so you get TONS of single player missions and content.  Only real drawbacks are the 1997 era graphics and occasional clumsy unit pathing.\n\nIf you can look past the graphics, the depth and difficulty really do rival that of most modern RTS games.  There is also no Auto-Save type feature so make sure to save your game often!  (and also use your commander to capture the warp gates, don't blow them up!  You'll thank me later...)\n\nDespite being an old game it works great in Windows 10 with no compatibilty problems or issues.

And no need for mods to get 1080p or higher. As the game even back in 1997 did scale to your max windows resolutions, sadly the game UI don't. Nor the radar. So at 2K or 4K they are really tiny. And ofc this has the addon "The Core Contingency" and lots of other old bonus missions. And yes. I use Win10 and it works just fine. At the time of this writing the Arm campaing is done, 11 hours played and not a single crash.\n\nThis game is equally great for turtle players and rushers alike. The SP campaign AI can be brutal on the attacks at times. But even a turtle player can focus on defenses and hold up until he is ready. Some of the maps are huge and will need some micro managing to get around well, but take your time and it will work out. There are tons of units to select form. So it will fit any style you have the more you progress in the story. I would recommend to google keyboard shortcuts, as there are a ton of then to make the game easier to handle. As the game set the standard for way point systems, so you can order a unit to move to the enemy base, attack a unit, fall back and patrol the base all in one way point go. Or set the commander to build a few buildings while you attack or scout.\n\n\nFor this price, even not on a discount. You would be foolish to skip this part of RTS history. It set the standards along with C&C for all time to come. Old or new RTS player, it won't take long to get into this gem. Even with the huge unit count. Only downside is that buildings count towards the unit cap at 200. But each unit counts as 1. Not 1 to 8 like in SC.\n\nHighly recommended.","December 20, 2015","true","26.6"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

No other game in my entire collection has more hours put into it than this game right here. Spanning across years, multiple computer systems, multiple OS, and countless mods, no other game I've ever owned has had as much attention in my life as this game right here.\n\nAnd now, it's on Steam.\n\nIt's not the best port, I'll say that right now. The cracked unofficial WIndows 7 version I had running on my Windows 8,1 computer two years ago ran smoother than this one, but I digress, to finally have this game on a Windows 10 computer is pretty nifty. It does look a bit dated compared to many modern RTS, but at the same time it handles quite well. If you've ever played a "Collect resources, build things, destroy your enemy" RTS in the past decade or so, Total Anihilation will be very easy to get into. There are a few technical issues with this port, and some fixes to resolution need to be made for certain, plust it seems the game only has the "official" patches, meaning the unit limit cap is sadly smaller than I'm used to. For those who thrived off of modding this game, you'll understand what I mean. For those that don't, let's just say a 500 unit cap was "small" to us.\n\nTechnical aspects aside, it is still a decent port and truly a game worthy of giving a look over. A rare gem of an RTS that was revolutionary back in a time dominated by Starcraft and Command & Conquer. Here you not only get the original legendary game itself, but all it's expansions and the final patch that was released shortly before Cavedog studios went belly up. For the price you're paying, it's well worth a play.\n\nEither for nostalgia's sake, curiosity, or if you're like me and never want to stop playing this game, OS be damned, then seriously, get it.\n\nEnd the war spanning the galaxy, and leave your enemy in total annihilation.","February 13","true","0.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It doesnt exactly hold up to todays standards in some areas as this game was made in the mid 90s, but that being said it still has features that a number of RTS games should have and still don't. This game set the standard upon what all RTS should be made. It had a number of features that were way a head of its time so the resolution is still great not to mention it was one of the first games to use advanced sound features so jeremy soule (Elder Scroll series, Harry Potter, Guild wars, a ton of other stuff) and his orchestrial soundtrack still get your adrenaline going.\n\nAs others have said, this is a nostalgic game that still has a community that supports it +1000s of maps and mods along with that. If you buy this expecting it to look like a brand new RTS you will be mistaken.\n\nOne last note. IF that graphics really do kill you but you like the feel of the game, there is always Supreme Commander/ Supreme Commander: FA. Same developers different studio and publisher. Also, Supreme Commander 2 sucks and is nothing like these.","December 18, 2015","true","0.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

When it was released in 1997, Total Annihilation was so far ahead of its time that in some respects it has never been duplicated since.\n\nAt the time I write this review there is no Steamworks multiplayer or Workshop mod support. But if these things are implemented, I have no doubts whatsoever that we will see a huge resurgence of Total Annihilation. There are already tens of thousands of third-party units, many mega-mods of hundreds of units, total conversions for everything from Star Wars to WWII to Gundam, to entirely new games built on TA as a basis. The amount of strategic depth flowing from fairly simple rules of collecting metal from metal spots and using it to construct various types of units, using a continous economy, physics-based battles, and a serious need for planning and tactics rather than unit counter relationships, make Total Annihilation a much deeper and more interesting strategy game than most of its contemporary cousins, including Starcraft and Age of Empires.\n\nReal time strategy games have been starved for ideas for many years now, with the most successful ones being sequels and spiritual successors to genuinely innovative strategy games from the '90s. Alongside Starcraft, Total Annihilation is one of the great progenitors of the modern era of strategy games, and in many respects it has never been equaled.","December 18, 2015","true","0.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

To understand you just need to PLAY it.\n\nThis game was my whole childhood, then Supreme Commander appeared and i was disappointed since it lacked the same vibe, and had a lot of unnecessary features. Then, recently Planetary Annihilation came trying to give us that sense of nostalgia, but it still couldn't cut it for me.\nWhen i saw this game came on steam, this was an instant buy for me, and now, if we can transfer the whole modding community here on steam, and patch the game some more, it would have limitless potential.\n\nWhat can i say,\nThe games made today are awesome in their own way, really, but the old ones like Total Annihilation, Unreal and UT, AoE, or even Ubisoft's 2000's Infestation (a game that people barely remember existed which is very disappointing)\nThere is something special about them that today's games lack.","December 23, 2015","true","2.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The scale of those battles was so much bigger than anything else at that time, I had a hard time playing any other RTS for years after TA.\n\nThe classical music, played by 96-piece Northwest Sinfonia orchestra, was also perfectly fitting for that kind of game, really good quality by Jeremy Soule, composer of Icewind Dale, Baldur's gate, Oblivion, Skyrim music and many more. Music switched depending on what you were doing, which was also uncommon at that time (with "battle themes" and "quiet themes" for construction phases, something we didn't see in every game at that time).\n\nUnit animation was also awesome for that time, with all those small robots animated everywhere. Seeing a group of robots run in one direction but with their torsos turned in another to shoot at an enemy is fun to see.\n\nThe game universe is great, very varied, lots of different map styles and landscapes. Game depth can be quite deep. There is A LOT of units (hundreds in base game, and hundreds in each DLC), and quite a lot of them are useful. Also has an incredible mix of units, from "pure" land tanks, or bombers, to planes that can "land" underwater, amphibious tanks, hovercraft units. Same for resources, a lot of different ways to get any of each of them, for power for example, you can go solar, nuclear, hydro plants, wind plants, etc.\n\nAlso, low price, all extensions (DLC) included, much better than all those 20 years old base games with terrible port sold for over $10.","December 18, 2015","true","16.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You were never locked down into a play style, you had the tools to do whatever you felt necessary. Maps were varied, from closed corridor battles to open ground which often changed from pristine wildernesses to a decimated hell hole throughout the course of the map.\n\nThe amount of content here is vast, it's an old school campaign, so tons of missions with good scaling difficulty, piles of maps for skirmishing and top mods available.

I have played this game so much, I don't think any other game can compare. The modding community at the time was crazy, tons of new options to add in. You can still find mods to this day. The first one was great but the expansions added so much more to the game. For its time this game was the Farcry of RTS, graphics were amazing, maps were never ending, and battles were not capped to 200 units per player. Game defaults to 1000 units, however patchs are available, or a simple edit of the config file to allow as many as you desire.\n\nWhen cavedog first offered their gaming service to connect players it was all I ever did. I finally had an endless amount of players to play with. It is just sad that the sequal to the game was such a downfall in the game play department. Seems to collopsed their mightly RTS empire.\n\nI hope you all enjoy this game as much as I did.\n\nJust some helpful hints to play the game, starting with before you actually play\nIt doesn't appear narration is available in the game, sad face. Maybe it is just mine. Secondly change left click to right click in the menus if your used to other RTS. Game sound starts at mono and can be changes to 3D (Stereo). Options accessed only once you select single or multiple player. Options in game can be selected by pressing tab. Game I believe is auto paused on start for all maps. Resolution support works for 1080p but must be selected, most games at this time barely supported 1280x1028.\n\nWhile playing:\nSpeed can be adjusted during single and multiple player via the + or - buttons.\nMultiple buildings can be queued together using shift.\nResource sharing is possible with allies at set increments so you never have to constantly send resources.\nBuilding units also has an infinite queue. Holding shift increments 5. Left click to add units, right click to remove.\nYour commander has a gun called the D-Gun hot key is D, this is a huge blast that can one shot everything but a commander and expieremental units not in the original (later expansions).\nIf your commander dies in campaign it is the end of the match, multiplayer depending on settings. Your commander blows up like a big nuke.\nPlanes build the slowest, then Kbots, then vechicles. Forgot hover vechicles, but they are in an expansion as well. Each one has different perks, and should be used together to cordinate strikes. However planes usually over power all else, as they are fast, hard to hit, and cheap to build.","December 19, 2015","true","0.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatFaggot/recommended/298030/","ThatFaggot","BloodyFloody","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatFaggot/","365 products in account","I'm a pretty crappy writer so I apologize in advance.\n\nTotal Annihilation is an incredibly unique and intense RTS that was light-years ahead of its time and still is today. I still strongly prefer the original over the more spiritual-successor, Planetary Annihilation.\n\nTotal Annihilation features so many small features that just make it amazing, the battles can be huge and intense with massive amounts of units having a huge Warhammer 40k esque fight all on one screen, or the games can be slow and brilliantly thought out. This is a strategy game where you can win purely by 'defensive' play at times, something I find to be rather unique among a lot of strategy games that even today have rather narrow methods to win, usually by just having the larger and better offensive force, but not always in Total Annihilation.\n\nA feature that makes Total Annihilation so unique is the true emphasis on a defensive playstyle, if you so desire. There are an impressive amount of options for defensive, slow play styles and faster, more offensive playstyles alike. You can choose to hunker down and improve your economy while building a large amount of turrets and upgrading to better ones over the course of the game, some are even capable of bombarding your opponent from the entire maps length, assuming you reach the demanding level of tech and economy required for them. Even tactical nukes can be constructed and launched over a map away if the game length and level of sustainable economy is reached. This allows for a lot of options for a lot of different types of players. There is also no real super demanding macro-memory required à la StarCraft II, making the game just a bit more accessable to newer players, especially in more team oriented game modes.\n\nThe game also features incredible physics for it's more 2.5 dimensional, isometric strategy experience. One of my favourite things about this game is seeing things like unit inaccuracy, especially when on the move or on unstable ground or even when taking pot-shots at something through the fog-of-war. Units will have better vision when on the high ground and worse vision when in a trench, making a lot of areas on maps incredibly strategic locations. There's even bullet physics, units will often adjust their aim higher or lower depending on the target, and when the steel corpses begin to litter the battlefield they will often block incoming rounds harmlessly while your units continue to trudge past the enemy fire. There's a gritty feeling seeing all your units charge an enemy fortified position only to begin seeing the missiles and rounds begin to rain down upon them and seeing a huge chunk of your force get obliterated by a large round, shaking the screen and sending chunks of steel flying in every direction, the steel "gibs" even damaging nearby units who get hit by them.\n\nThe game also features an amazing orchestral 'dynamic' music score written and composed by the one and only Jeremy Soule. The music really compliments an already fantastic game nicely, changing to a more brooding tone as you build up your base and switching to a more heart-pounding score as enemy fighters engage your army. It's an incredible soundtrack that you may even consider finding for your own music player. The sound design alone in this game is also very unique and give it a great distinct and 'mechanical' feel.\n\nIf there was one strategy that I think is criminally unknown to most people, this would have to be it. It's made an amazingly tight-knit community that continue to play the original and have a huge modding scene. (Seriously, try the Total Annihilation Escalation mod, it's just insanely good.) Some even going as far as recreating the Total Annihilation experience in full 3D via an open source engine called Spring, try Spring Total Annihilation out sometime, it has a great community still supporting it to this day.\n\nOverall it's my favourite RTS game of all time, and I'm not even a huge RTS fan. It's incredibly exciting just to watch with an amazing soundtrack and huge, epic battles.\n\n10/10, would D-Gun again.","December 20, 2015","true","1.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I have yet to find another RTS game that blends The Atmosphere, Music, Gameplay, Story, and even the Intro! Into such a work that defines a very well made RTS game!

Please get this Relic if you are a fan of the RTS Genre, download now with the mods and multiplayer support....You will never regret it I promise you. If you are the type of person that cares alot about graphics then i can't help you there unless you want Balanced Annihilation on the spring engine that has more refined 3d graphics and plays somewhat different. Anyway it is a very in depth game to this day and is not that hard to learn. You will be constantly be getting better at this game. If you got problem with modding don't worry about it. Just go in the steam discussions and the forums on TA universe, they will help.

As an example, I tend to play with multiple static long range artillery bases, using anti-air defence to protect the assets and scout aircraft to look for things to crush.  However, if you like tanks (you do right?) then you can build a sexy amount of them and ram them down the enemies throat.  You'll loose more units, but it's way more satisfying than building fire bases.\n\nYou only have 2 resources (metal and enery), so thats easy to master.  There are land, sea, sub-sea and air units, as well as structures that provide various functions.  There is now a huge range of maps, and if you play one of the metal ones that eliminates a common early problem of lack of metal for construction.\n\nThe only down side I would raise is there are only 2 sides (core and arm).  However, you get use your commander to stride across a wide variety of map types and blast the crap out of stuff.

So i bought the game... again?\n\nMan, i can't tell you how many thousands of hours i threw into this game while growing up, And the thousands more i have with the mods i downloaded.\n\nIm running on a win10, i booted up the game and it worked flawlessly. had to google some things i forgot like adding -d for windows as a launch parameter, and setting the game's resolution in the main menu before starting the game. But after i got past the small things i jumped right into the game and started playing, killing some bots quickly and then moving on to some mods.\n\n2 mods to look at are zero, and escalation.\n\nBut without mods the game is considered a mass RTS. You start out with just your commander and you gather some metal deposits in the world, generate energy, and create some buildings for defenses, and factorys to produce your units.\nIn a game like this, you want to be using up 100% of your produced resourses 24/7, pumping out as many units as you possibly can. If you go over, you run your storage dry and production gets slower. If you dont use 100% you end up wasting excess when your storage is full.\n\nDefault maps are very bland for me, i usually just to randomly pick one and go with it.\nAnd if you play against the AI, even on the hardest difficulty you are going to destroy them easily in a 1v1, once you know the base of the game.","December 21, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

I recall being immediately blown away by how fluid and realistic the action was.  I remember the presenter showed an ingame clip of the action depicting a dozen of infantry bots marching haphazardly through a plain with some trees scattered about.  Meanwhile ovehead, three fighters intercepts an incoming enemy bomber.  The fighters fired a salvo of missiles, and barrel rolls away from the explosion of a downed bomber.  EPIC.\n\nI brought this game more than 20 years ago.  I've recreated that scene on numerous occasions and then some.  I felt the combination of variety in unit behavior, weapon physic, and the rock/paper/scissor approach to balancing was the epitomy of what real time strategy games are.  Twenty years later, I believe this is still the core defintion that only one other RTS IP was able to achieve, and that's Homeworld.\n\nThere's Supreme Commander and Planetary Annihiliation, but those are essentially spiritual successors.  Even then, it's still missing something that makes Total Annihilation unique.\n\nPlus you have these things\nCarpet bombing\nAircraft carriers\nA wall of artillaries shooting\nFlak guns\nEPIC SOUNDTRACK\n\nI would buy this again many times over if steam goes away.","January 17","true","0.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Next to Surpreme Commander 1 only upped the scale and mayham SC2 I cann't even call it a RTS.\n\nIf you like griddy older games that was great for it day.  I can suggest this one for a title add your library.\nAlso go folder and go to  "TotalA.exe" left click and pick "Run As Admin".\nThis may help some that may want to run it.

With the proper .ini file installed, the cap can then be safely raised to 500 units. However, if you want raise the cap any higher, it's necessary to install a different version of TotalA.exe (downloadable from several locations incl. TA Universe). This plus setting the unit cap to 1500 units in the .ini file will indeed give you a limit of 1500 units in the game, but there is a problem, and the cause seems to be the altered TotalA.exe file.\n\nPlaying with the TotalA.exe file downloaded from Steam and using the .ini file for 500 units, the game played fine all the way through to the end. But as soon as I replaced the default version of TotalA.exe with the version of TotalA.exe included in the 1500 unit patch from TA Universe, the game started consistently crashing whenever I would take my armada of aircraft over to start harassing the enemy base. This happened several times even though I only had about 500 total units at the time. About 200 of those were my aircraft. To eliminate sound as the issue, I tried disabling Direct Sound and using Windows sound instead, but the result was exactly the same.\n\nMy system is Windows 7 x64bit, and I have no mods installed yet. The ONLY difference between the two scenarios was the TotalA.exe file from TA Universe which is necessary to be able to raise the unit cap to 1500 units. The downloaded game from Steam was not changed in any other way.\n\nI'm aware of a beta patch available from TA Universe but haven't tried it yet. I'm thinking about seeing if I can find my old TA disk and installing TA, TA:CC, and TA:BT with that, then patching to 3.1 and so on. If that does fix the issue, then the problem is with the Steam version of the game. So for now, I don't recommend buying the game from Steam because most people will want to exceed the 500 unit cap.","March 18","false","14.0"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","2"

I tried a multiplayer session with a friend and we could not join each other's game, regardless of who hosted. I was hoping the game code would have been revamped to work on modern operating systems, but that seems to not be the case. It's dependent on DirectPlay, an API that has been deprecated by Microsoft since the early 2000's.\n\nedit:\nAt the time we attempted to play this game, my friend and I were on the same local area network (192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.11). At one point, I did alt+tab out of the game, and added an exception, when prompted, to the Windows Firewall to allow this game to communicate. We were able to see each other's game on the list of games, but when either of us attempted to join the other's hosted game, the interface would lock up and hang indefinitely.\n\nMy review of not recommending this game is solely based on the game's current state. The networking code is obviously dated and doesn't "work out of the box," requiring tweaking and/or third-party extensions to make it work. This is not what I had in mind when I paid $5 for the Steam version of this game.\n\nAs far as the game itself, my friend and I had a lot of fun playing this game a decade ago when it worked. So if the game did "work out of the box," I would give this game a thumbs up.","January 3","false","0.9"," 4 of 36 people (11%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","11","4","36","2","4"

Since WHEN does a building count as a unit? In pretty much every RTS ever made, a unit is MOBILE, a character or vehicle with combat, constructive, or special abilities. Buildings are STATIONARY. They typically do nothing to defend your base and are used for production purposes. So, let's say you're expanding your base, fighting tooth and claw for metal, building solar complexes and also building DEFENSES to PROTECT what you've had to fight hard for. Laser towers on resource spots, production buildings abroad so you can deploy forces from key locations. Well guess what? This whole time you've been expanding your base, you have been taking space from your COMBAT UNITS.\n\nThere is a UNIT CAP. So now, if you do have an expanded base, there's a good chance the enemy has a larger fighting force than you and regardless of whether you attack or wait to be attacked, you'll take heavy casualties and the enemy will sense this and just overwhelm you with a larger army. Oh and the game DOESN'T tell you how close you're getting to the unit cap. So you basically have to finely tune the production of everything or else you might waste an hour and a half because your fighting units are crippled by the unit cap. This is the issue I've found in campaign and it's kind of horse s***.\n\nIn closing, why does a game called TOTAL ANNIHILATION, which is about the mass production of combat robots between two factions who have been hating each other for 400 years have this cap? It's like putting a diaper on a grizzly bear. Wherever we look, sentient robots are a HUGE problem. Terminator: the whole damn planet has been overrun with machines. Mass Effect: THE WHOLE F****** UNIVERSE is about to be destroyed by machines. Robots bring two things when they attack, firepower and numbers. In a game like Age of Empires it makes sense. Want to train more troops and villagers? You need more houses/castles for your people to shelter in. Robots don't give a f*** about rest and typically don't care about how much space is left on the planet, they just want to kill stuff!","December 23, 2015","false","5.2"," 4 of 107 people (4%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","4","4","107","14","4"

It still has issues of disappearing status bar at the bottom of the screen if you actually run AT your resolution (1920x1080 for example), you gotta run at something like 1680x900 in order to actually see the entire UI on screen, which is ridiculous.\nAnd it really is a must, because you NEED that status bar to see build rates, energy and metal rates, etc for selected or hovered-over items and factories.\n\nThe great thing however is that this IS the best working version so far. You dont have to edit .ini files or use third party apps to get it running properly in fullscreen without glitches, apart from the above mentioned. For that alone it is worth a rebuy (because we cant really blame the original devs for not considering Windows 8 / 10 compatability, now can we?) :)\n\nThat said, I highly recommend people to immediately get some of the convenience mods / balance patches out there.\nIn some ways they are almost required to enjoy the game in a modern RTS mindset.\nSuch as being able to select groups with just pressing 1, instead of pressing Alt+1 which was ridiculous at that time, and is still highly user-unfriendly today.\nOr being able to hold and drag buildings when holding shift. Makes building walls feasible, which it wasnt in vanilla TA placing one at a time, click click click click.\n\nA great masterpiece of a game that DOES show its age due to some weird control schemes they opted for in the old days.\nBut with mods to modernize and "logicalize" the controls, it still holds up today, despite the awful pathfinding.\nThe pure atmosphere and "feel" of the game is still un-rivaled. No other RTS "feels" like TA.\nPerhaps it is the music, perhaps it is the graphics, perhaps it is the clunky slow controls.\nNo matter what it is, it is greater than the sum of its part. A robbery at this price, must-buy.","December 19, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Composed by Jeremy Soule, the soundtrack has that suspencful classic theme to it whenever you are in combat, which just makes the gameplay experience so much better!\n\nI also thought the story and lore of Total Annihilation was really cool, so I will give you a brief summary (Spoilers probably)\n\nIn the far future the galaxy is ruled by a central body of humans and artificial intelligences called the Core, and their triumphs has set to colonize the milky way galaxy and set them in a long lasting time of prosperity.\n\nAll has changed when a technological breakthrough called "Patterning", which transfers human consciousness into mechanical bodies, which makes them live indefinately. The Core makes this a public health measure and made it manditory to Pattern all human life forms. A rebellious group called the Arm protested and fought the Core because of this decision, resulting in a 4000 year war.\n\nThe Arm and the Core fought so viciously, which lead to the extinction of the human race, but the robotic armies of the two still manage to fight and keep the war going.

From a CD-R of the skirmish disc to a legit big box copy, I invested hundreds if not thousands of hours in Total Annihilation during the tail-end of the 90s. Its relaxed pace, expansive map size and tactical variety put the microscopic, tunnel-visioned zerg rush of StarCraft and Red Alert to shame, the competitor's popularity be damned.\n\nMy opinion has not changed in the nearly two decades that have passed since Total Annihilation's launch date; this is still a forward-thinking masterwork of the RTS genre, its eerily desolate atmosphere and lush, Jeremy Soule-composed score just as evocative as it was back then.\n\nAm I biased? Perhaps. Is it perfect? Not at all, but given the time period and meager price tag for what is the definitive Total Annihilation experience?

The protagonist race, the Arm, has been warring with the machine Core for an impossibly long time. The single-player campaign is typical for early RTSs--learn how to explore, unlock a few units at a time, and build up to large, long battles near the end. You can choose to play as either race in single player, and each one's story can be completed in ~10 hours.\n\nThe multiplayer and skirmish are where I spent most of my time when I played in the early 00s.\n\nWhile the title set impressive standards in 3D modeling, realistic physics, detailed UI, and developing a still-active modding community, the age of the game is showing in 2016. AI pathfinding and base management is horrible, to put it plainly. Still, the graphics and soundtrack are as impressive as ever. I'm still amazed that this game was released in 1997.\n\nThe add-ons breathed amazing new life into the game when they were released. The Core Contingency adds an excellent single-player arc for each faction, and along with the story, many exciting new units.\n\nThis is a great game to relive the RTS glory days of the late 90s. Pick a copy up, gift a copy to a friend, and battle it out for a few exciting hours.\n\nPS: If you love the style and controls, you will definitely want to get Supreme Commander, which was developed by the same lead and is regarded as the "spiritual successor" of TA.","January 3","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The level of detail and thought put into the hundreds of buildings and units on both sides means that you must anticipate your opponents strategies.\n\n-Some of the best video game music produced by Jeremy Soule\n\n-Visuals were amazing for their time and have aged incredibly well, and still immerse you into the world of TA to this day.\n\n-Build freaking huge tank armies, navies, aircraft, Turrets, nukes, or tank-turret-nuke nightmares (you know what i speak of), and prepare for the most epic and chaotic battles of any RTS games.\n\n-The game is freaking epic on every level especially with how it plays out.","December 22, 2015","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It still has issues of disappearing status bar at the bottom of the screen if you actually run AT your resolution (1920x1080 for example), you gotta run at something like 1680x900 in order to actually see the entire UI on screen, which is ridiculous.\nAnd it really is a must, because you NEED that status bar to see build rates, energy and metal rates, etc for selected or hovered-over items and factories.\n\nThe great thing however is that this IS the best working version so far. You dont have to edit .ini files or use third party apps to get it running properly in fullscreen without glitches, apart from the above mentioned. For that alone it is worth a rebuy (because we cant really blame the original devs for not considering Windows 8 / 10 compatability, now can we?) :)\n\nThat said, I highly recommend people to immediately get some of the convenience mods / balance patches out there.\nIn some ways they are almost required to enjoy the game in a modern RTS mindset.\nSuch as being able to select groups with just pressing 1, instead of pressing Alt+1 which was ridiculous at that time, and is still highly user-unfriendly today.\nOr being able to hold and drag buildings when holding shift. Makes building walls feasible, which it wasnt in vanilla TA placing one at a time, click click click click.\n\nA great masterpiece of a game that DOES show its age due to some weird control schemes they opted for in the old days.\nBut with mods to modernize and "logicalize" the controls, it still holds up today, despite the awful pathfinding.\nThe pure atmosphere and "feel" of the game is still un-rivaled. No other RTS "feels" like TA.\nPerhaps it is the music, perhaps it is the graphics, perhaps it is the clunky slow controls.\nNo matter what it is, it is greater than the sum of its part.

Just reading about it brough so much nostalgia - I still have 2 CDs for the game, with the booklet on story and individual units in my home country somewhere. I played it when I was little, when I couldn't understand a word in English XD\nOne disk was for Single and the other for Multi player after installation, I believe.\n\nThe game itself was brilliant, so versatile and with so many options and units, advanced extraction facilities and units - and that was just the original version - never had the expansions before.\nUnique system of having one special unit called Commander, who you used to build basic structures and then had to protect him from destruction, or you would loose. You can capture buildings and enemies with him, and if you did it correctly, you could then start building units and buildings of the opposite fracion! Not that it would matter much though, as both fractions have almost idenical units for most part (varied just look and attack type), even the same number of them varies just by 2-4 objects less or more on each side ovarall.\n\nGoing in Skirmish mode against AI was a bit pointless though - Difficulty gave the AI upper hand, instead of making it smarter. The enemy almost never used advanced weaponry, or buildings. I hope this will be different with this version.\n\nDespite its little flaws above, it could still be called indescribably brilliant game - at the time of its relevance, and even in this day. Give me Total Annihilation over some of those new fancy RTSs any time.","December 19, 2015","true","28.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember walking through Sam's Club back in 1997 and seeing the display for this game. A buddy of mine bought the game and told me you gotta see this game. Never before had we seen anything like it and we were instantly hooked as were several other of our friends. Back the, you had to download a program so you play against others, so we opted for Lan parties instead.\nSince 1997, I have pulled this game out and played it everyyear since. When I tried to load it up a week ago, it didn't work. Was a little dissappointed and thought it was time to move on and then it popped up on my front page yesterday. I didn't hesitate.\nThe base game and both expansions are here and there are at least 150 single player missions and more units than you can possibly imagine. Makes for very large scale battles, especially if you are playing on one of the metal maps. The graphics are obviousley lacking and the game isn't as revelutionary as it was then, but this game has great meaning for me and changed the way I viewed gaming. It was the first game that got me really excited and it changed the way games were made.\nI remember Chris Taylor saying he wanted to go straight to TA2, but they wanted to make TA:Kingdoms, which was a game I enjoyed, but not even close to as much as TA. And because they didn't go straight to TA2, well, the rest is history. TA:K didn't do so well and the company eventually went under with no sequel ever done. The ownership has changed many times over (last I heard a company in Japan had it and wouldn't part with it) and a sequel does not seem to ever be coming which is a tragedy. It is probably one of the reasons this game is as iconic and beloved as it still is today.\nAfter loading up the game last night, I coudn't beleive that 2 hours had passed so quickly. Still love and cherish this game.","December 19, 2015","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The protagonist race, the Arm, has been warring with the machine Core for an impossibly long time. The single-player campaign is typical for early RTSs--learn how to explore, unlock a few units at a time, and build up to large, long battles near the end. You can choose to play as either race in single player, and each one's story can be completed in ~10 hours.\n\nThe multiplayer and skirmish are where I spent most of my time when I played in the early 00s.\n\nWhile the title set impressive standards in 3D modeling, realistic physics, detailed UI, and developing a still-active modding community, the age of the game is showing in 2016. AI pathfinding and base management is horrible, to put it plainly. Still, the graphics and soundtrack are as impressive as ever. I'm still amazed that this game was released in 1997.\n\nThe add-ons breathed amazing new life into the game when they were released. The Core Contingency adds an excellent single-player arc for each faction, and along with the story, many exciting new units.\n\nThis is a great game to relive the RTS glory days of the late 90s. Pick a copy up, gift a copy to a friend, and battle it out for a few exciting hours.\n\nPS: If you love the style and controls, you will definitely want to get Supreme Commander, which was developed by the same lead and is regarded as the "spiritual successor" of TA.","January 3","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/artsynmk/recommended/298030/","artsynmk","Potato Girl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/artsynmk/","5 products in account","Total Annihilation is a ridiculously fun and addictive RTS game that was developed in 1997 by a little company called Cavedog. For an almost 20-year-old game, it's amazing how fun this game is to still play.\n\nThe user interface is very user-friendly, and the game itself is simple to learn. Despite the ease of being able to get into the game and just start playing, there is a wide variety of units that allow an incredible level of complex creativity in terms of strategy. Total Annihilation is like eating candy without the calories: it gives you a cool robot army, huge explosions, and probably one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard composed for a game.\n\nTotal Annihilation is also very mod-friendly and customizable.\n\nDespite being a great game, there are some pitfalls: Getting a multiplayer game can be tricky if you have no idea what you're doing. You will need to connect to the ip address of the host, which most modern games do for you automatically. Additionally, there is a unit cap of 250 (which includes buildings) that you *can* increase, but you have to manually edit the totala.ini file. This can be a pain in the butt for the computer-challenged, but isn't difficult to actually do.\n\nThe main complaint I hear about this game is the pathfinding. And I agree. Sometimes your units will do what seem to be nonsensical things, like trying to drive up a wall instead of going around it. Very large armies also have difficulty moving around, and the units tend to get stuck on each other. Naval units are the best example of this, where they will grind against each other trying to find their way to a destination. There ARE pathfinding patches out there that will significantly help with these difficulties, though.\n\nOverall, this is a great game. I highly recommend it for pretty much anyone ever.","December 24, 2015","true","16.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Design is brilliant - smart and very innovative. Game is easy to learn and hard to master so no matter what level you are, you won't be bored. I don't feel like TA got old at all. Still feels fresh so many years after the release. I was very pleased to see the game on Steam. There are forums dediceted to the game so if you ever need any advice you won't be left on your own.\nMUST HAVE for any RTS fan.","May 7","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Prior to this, I'd played some SupComm, but it didn't quite scratch the itch this one did. Great modding community that keeps the advanced players around, astounding base game, and a soundtrack to die for. These are only a few of the reasons to buy it, counting what other people have said. My only problem with it is a lack of a Mac OS X port. Much as I'd love to buy it again through GoG (which does contain a ported version), it feels like a waste to buy it twice just for the ability to play it on my laptop. To anyone thinking about purchasing it, I advise Total Annihilation whole-heartedly, but I'd advise the GoG version simply by virtue of mac compatibility and ease of unit cap increasing.","May 24","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
