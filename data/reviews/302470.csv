Something very similar is perhaps Praetorians.\nEvery troop (units are broken into troops, you can't control soldiers individually) gains its own experience and can be upgraded in a town when it reaches every 3 levels.\nMonster dens are scattered around every map (the campaign is broken into maps) specificially for grinding experience, money and items, which can be equipped on units.\nThe most powerful units are perhaps battle mages - you can control them individually, they have multiple useful spells to  cast and they fire destructive area-damaging spells like they're semi-automatic artillery or something. Though it takes long to grind XP to upgrade them to the maximum level.\nThe player's main character is presented as a spirit flying in the air in front of the camera. He can't participate in the battle directly. He gains XP along with the player's army and just hurls spells.\nHere are controls for the camera:\nWASD or arrow keys or move the cursor to the edge of the screen - to move the camera.\nHold ctrl+WASD or arrow keys - rotate the view. This actually gives the impression of first-person view.\nYou can pause with Space, and you can't move the camera while paused, but you can still rotate.\nRight-clicking on a troop instantly brings the camera to it, even when paused.\n\nI noticed that the mana does not play any role. It's never spent when I cast spells. Nothing ever happens when mana becomes 0. I'm allowed to cast spells which cost more mana than I have at max. So leveling the mana skill is a waste of XP.\n\nUnits sometimes get stuck on cornerns of the terrain. It doesn't happen too often, it can be fixed by manually moving the unit to the other side. But it is damn annoying.\n\nMusic suddenly interrupts all the time and only resumes playing when a battle starts. There's a volume slider in game options, but no checkbox to switch music on/off so that you could restart it.\n\nYou will not be able to play this game on normal speed, because in that case it is too boring. The speed can be regulated with (+) and (-) keys on the number pad of the keyboard. I couldn't find this option anywhere in the game settings or explained anywhere, so I'm writing it.\n\nNot a single crash has occured. Brilliant.\n\nNow, the actual review.\nFirst off, the tutorial doesn't cover 90% of gameplay, you have to figure it out on your own. Difficulty of that depends on how many RTS games you've played.\n\nThe kind of mage you choose before the start of the campaign only affects the starting skills and spells you get. And the avatar icon, yes. Everything else is the same.\n\nThe campaign is extremely, punishingly difficult at the beginning and becomes too easy starting somewhere from the middle of it. Saving often is adviced, because suddenly you might lose a battle mage, which is too valuable. Using multiple save files is adviced, because sometimes you can get unexpectedly cornered by overwhelming enemy troops, who were just passing by and you happened to make company with them.\n\nThe quests are completely uninspired: go there, talk to that person (you can't even choose replies in dialogue), bring that item over there, escort a slow-♥♥♥ wagon from point A to point B. And completely nothing happens while you escort a thing or go from A to B. Nothing. At all. And the wagon is sloooooow.... Seriously, most part of the game is walking around the map. You can tell your army to move somewhere and go away from the keyboard for 3-4 minutes. On maximum game speed.\n\nThe voice acting is really good, although that wolf howl is a pain for the ears, and some voices (goblin's) are not so great.\n\nThe cutscenes are something like in Warcraft 3, except really poorly done (I mean it, year 2003 is in no way an excuse for this) - you can tell it even by how the camera is flying around. Very often it's showing a single place and flying around it for 40 seconds, and nothing happens. Absolutely nothing happens. The characters are just standing, playing their completely out-of-place idle animations, and the camera is rolling around and ugh... No words can explain this.\n\nThe graphics don't seem to be designed to look good, even for 2003, except for a few models and unit and special effects animations. The faces of the elves are especially ugly, but maybe they're supposed to be? The map models are incredibly plain - just textured ground (thanks God, not plain ground - it contains hills, bumps and stuff). Occasional trees and rocks and buildings, but in limited quantities. It does manage to set the mood, though.\n\nThe plot.. Um. I can't say I'm disappointed, because somehow it seems fitting for a fantasy-themed game, but let me explain. It is all fairy-tale cliche mostly. The missions are brutally straight-forward: we need to do something in order to achieve something, in the process we learn new information and get new tasks to do.  The plot does get confusing in the middle and in the end, when seemingly random names of mages of the Guild of Mages are mentioned. Near the end it hardly makes sense even.\nThe only things that can be interesting about it is how new information about what's going on is revealed to the player (although it may appear kind of stupid..and random). The most exciting things are perhaps intermission cutscenes, they are really well done. They contain drawn black-and-white images, with amazing voice-over (sadly, without subtitles, but you probably won't need them). It looks beautiful.\n\nThe core combat mechanics, combined with RPG elements, spell-casting and rock-scissors-paper tactics, give an exciting mix. The game is not boring during battles and you may really want to slow the game speed down (unless you're grinding on monster mobs) and get to microing your ranged units away from melee attackers. The battles are the main part of the game, and it turned out although not perfectly, but still incredibly satisfying.\n\nI recommend this game only to those who enjoy RTS, grinding and leveling, and who have enough patience to bear the plot, old graphics, generally slow pace and bugs.","October 17, 2014","true","17.0"," 74 of 78 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","74","78","0","0"

You assemble an army, complete quests, fight enemies to make the world a safer place and save it from annihilation. You have a wide variety of available troops from human, orc, elf and goblin races including close range fighters, long range troops, mages and even heavy artillery. Also possible to add demons to your army. As you fight enemies, you and your troops gain experience. Your troops get stronger with each level of experience and when a unit reaches level 3, you can upgrade them to a better unit, but demons can't be upgraded and have only one level. Upgrades can be done in any available town of the right race (human troops get updated in human towns etc.). Not all kind of towns will be available though, since you will travel to far away lands.\n\nYou aid your troops with spells, healing and empowering them, summoning Magical spirits to aid them. You also have a wide variety of damaging spells you can use on your enemies. Spells require mana to be cast, with no mana you can cast only the spells you put in quick access (F5-F9, F10 summons Magical spirit and can't be changed). After casting a spell from quick access, it takes a while to regenerate. When you gain experience, you can use it to learn new spells, learn new skills or upgrade your max mana, mana regeneration or maximum army size and more. When you reach a new level, a new set of spells gets available. There are three schools of magic available - Nature, Chaos (fire) and Energy. You can study them all or you can choose what spells you wan't, but spells have dependencies, that is, to learn a higher spell, you must first learn the necessary lower spells.  The dependencies are indicated with vertical lines that connect spells.\n\nThe towns also can level up, to do so, they need resources - wood, stone, food and gold. The town has peasants who work in mines, sawmills and windmills and delivers the resources to town. With every new town level, new set of troops gets available.\n\nThe game itself proved to be fun and interesting. Just as I thought that it has became boring, it spiced things up, thus keeping me entertained. There are also some hidden surprises, like a chance to add a demon to your army. The game is old and it's noticeable via the graphics, but it runs smooth and it doesn't hurt the game play. I can't tell about the other languages, but at some parts English dialogs were terrible.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game if you like RPG or RTS games, this game certainly delivers what it's supposed to.","December 22, 2015","true","19.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The story is bland and only there to take you from level to level, but it does its job.\nThere are a lot of cool spells and most of them even have a use. Spamming fireballs and healing alone isnt enough.\nSometimes a unit gets stuck in a corner, then you just have to bring the whole troop back to unstuck it, which can take a while.\n\nThe biggest problem of the game is the walking, which is sooooo boring.
