Trust me. I didn't rely on the people in this review section, and here I am, tossing money out of the window at a mobile port that has no merit on PC whatsoever. I know you all don't have time to read text that I write, so I devide my review in Bulletpoints for easier confus- ehem, understanding.\n\n+ Pixels\n+ HD Mode\n+ All "Elements" unlocked from the start\n\n- Bad PC port that doesn't support wide screen (Ugly, nauseating borders)\n- Not even Sound Volume Sliders\n- Bad AI pathfinding\n- Nimble Editor, Mouse/Keyboard Pottential not used.\n- Grossly oversized UI (In my opinion, if you like buttons covering up 1/6 of your screen at any time...)\n- Look at the DLC box. The guys at Pixowl are already doing the TERRIBLE DLC thing.\n- "Mana" (In-game currency) not removed, Microtransactions beware.\n\nAt the moment, this Early Access suffers from a bad case of Mobile Port Trauma. Plague Inc. Has shown us how to do a good PC port: You take the working iOS/Android Concept, rebuild the Game in a new, adaptable engine, Consistently add new features while listening to the community for support, feedback and translations.\n\nThis Game is placed in one line with Tiny Troopers and the lot. No Merit to be on steam, Buyer's remorse galore.\n\nNow, If you excuse me, I have to eat chocolate.

But what I got was a waste of money that I could have used to buy Don't Starve, but instead I got:\n\n1. A game with a confusing tutorial (the developer has asked me to detail this, SPOILER ALERT: In one of the early tutorials in which I was tasked to mine out a mountain to get metal which i would use to fill a square. There was no mountain, just a square)\n\n2. Lacking graphics even for early access\n\n3. Bad sound design\n\n4. No way to quit out other than Xing out, and when you do it doesn't save your game. (fixed, may have been a bug)\n\nIt has potential, but for now avoid it. I want a refund, because this game is a waste of time.\n\nEDIT: Shut up you guys, I know it's supposed to be 8-bit, it still looks like crap. Early Access is no excuse for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, there still has to be SOME level of quality.\n\nEDIT NUMBER 2: Ok, I'm sorry if my review sounded ragey but I was just seriously disappointed. For those of you who didn't guess, I rate Early Access games as if they are full games in order to help the devs make the game better in the full version. I get having a pixel art stylization but it still doesn't look good. Maybe bump it up to at least 16 bit, or be consistent and make them as detailed as the tutorial guy in the game.\n\nFurthermore, I'm tired of people yelling at me and me not being able to respond. If you're going to make a comment, have the comments open in your profile. Otherwise, if a comment frustrates me, I'm just going to delete it.\n\nANOTHER EDIT: I have played the game for longer and found that it is actually pretty ok. The save glitch is fixed, it might have just been a bug that happened once. But the graphics seriously get in the way on the later campaigns in which you can't see what thing you're supposed to light/power/blow up/ etc. It's ok, but I'd still wait for it to be finished.","April 22, 2014","false","0.7"," 251 of 399 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","251","399","5","18"

This is what mostly ruined the game for me. I can only spawn 6 humans, I mean theyre just like 6 pixels that stand around or randomly walk into two directions, I think we should be able to spawn as many as we want to.\nSecond, add some better deaths. I throw lava on a human i expect to see him run around burning and turning into a charred corpse or atleast just run around and then fall down, but he just simply disappears. It made me think if that was intended or if it was just a glitch in the game.\nAlso, you talk about a zombie survival mode. So when we shoot zombies will they also just simply disappear in a mere nano second?\nThird, give us an option to, for example have normal water that doesnt have spasms on the top layer, shooting blue pixels up the sky every second. Just some still water so I can create a lake or pond and have it be there instead of disappearing in mere minutes.\nFourth, an option to unlock everything with just one click. This game is supposed to be a sandbox after all, so I would like to have more freedom of what I want to do, instead of being forced to do certain stuffs and quests so I can buy me a pine tree to grow.\nFifth, More Modding Support, like creating custom creatures or elements.\nSixth, more human varations. Right now theres only one man and one woman and the workers.\nThats all I can think of. These are the truly gamebreaking things in this game for me.\nYou fix / adress these issues and I'll probably give this a good review, considering the graphics and future updates stuff look / sound really good.","April 24, 2014","false","0.6"," 126 of 201 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","126","201","0","34"

You can't click on anything, or it will crash the game.\n\n- In "create" mode, none of the tools work, except the eraser, and screenshot tool. Everything else crashes the game. (That's already 1/4 of the game that doesn't work)\n\n- In the mission mode, the tools still don't work.

That's right.\n\nThe game does not work.\n\n\nConclusion: This game is simply a mediocre mobile game, ported over terribly (that's an understatement), to the point where the game does not even work, period. They didn't even put any effort into changing any of the features in-game to match the fact that it is not on a mobile device. Do not waste your time, nor money, on this scam.\n\n\nHere's some other gripes:\n\n- About 20 minutes of gameplay, until you get bored.\n\n- Deceptive trailers\n\n- Strange resolution errors- especially when starting up the game, and the menu.","March 12, 2015","false","0.8"," 48 of 68 people (71%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","71","48","68","8","0"

But it's not worth $10. Granted, it has a lot of interesting concepts at work, and maybe if it wasn't just a pixel based game it might be something, but as it stands, it's not.\n\nAlso, all the images above to sell the game are downright lies. All those images are splash screens, and aren't of the actual game. Any "people" in the game are made of six pixels, and have only rudimentary A.I. at best; it's less like a god simulator in the same world as "Black and White" or "Godus" and more along the lines of a worse version of "From Dust."\n\nMy suggestion is to avoid this game, unless ten dollars isn't a huge amount of money for you, but there are better games for this amount. Quite frankly, it doesn't meet the "dollar per hour" standard I use, even at $10.","October 14, 2014","false","2.0"," 43 of 63 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","43","63","3","0"

This one lags horribly, especially when using such things as the earthquake. It makes static noises. And it just works like garbage in general. On top of that the screenshot that shows mobile size vs pc size is a load of bull. It's not landscape at all. In fact, there's a rock looking skin on either side of your screen and no option showing that you can change it to a larger size. Finally, the game is EXTREMELY behind in updates compared to the mobile device. I can honestly recommend this game for pc. And there's literally so many bugs that it SOMEHOW managed to show a quest that was further ahead on one and it wouldn't let me pass when I did the correct items.

You can buy your way through the campaign, it costs 150 in game currency to pass any mission, most missions give you over 200 or even into the 1000s if completed, and for some reason when you skip the mission you still get the in game currency, so you can basicly buy your way through the campaign and still make a profit, you should either make the skipping more expensive, ie for a mission where you can win 1000, it should cost 1200, or when someone skips they should not get any form of bonus.\n2.

It hands you a bunch of elements (quite a few actually, with the ability to make more), gives you a blank canvas and says "well, im going to go over here for a tic. Go have fun". The elements it offers you are all scripted to interact differently with eachother, and will often transmute themselves to a different element (lava dropped in water becomes stone, wood burning produces ash).\n\nAnd once you get beyond the simple stuff, you can move onto the complexities of "emitters" and the wonderfully blank/sentient creatures that you can play with.\n\n\nWith all these tools combined you are left with a game without a plot, and without any real set goals... and its Fantastic!  (note: there ARE a plethora of "story mode" levels, as well as a campaign mode that serves as a more in depth tutorial)\n\n\nSo all in all, i think this is a delightful little time waster as long as you dont expect AAA blockbuster content from it. THis is not a CoD clone, this is not Half LIfe 3, this is just a cute little toy you can play with and kill some time\n\n\n...the price is a tad steep tho.

It hands you a bunch of elements (quite a few actually, with the ability to make more), gives you a blank canvas and says "well, im going to go over here for a tic. Go have fun". The elements it offers you are all scripted to interact differently with eachother, and will often transmute themselves to a different element (lava dropped in water becomes stone, wood burning produces ash).\n\nAnd once you get beyond the simple stuff, you can move onto the complexities of "emitters" and the wonderfully blank/sentient creatures that you can play with.\n\n\nWith all these tools combined you are left with a game without a plot, and without any real set goals... and its Fantastic!  (note: there ARE a plethora of "story mode" levels, as well as a campaign mode that serves as a more in depth tutorial)\n\n\nSo all in all, i think this is a delightful little time waster as long as you dont expect AAA blockbuster content from it. THis is not a CoD clone, this is not Half LIfe 3, this is just a cute little toy you can play with and kill some time\n\n\n...the price is a tad steep tho.

This turned out not to be the case. The release price is $10 and humans dlc is still free.\n\n\nupdate 12 July: no further work was done on the game between them announcing they would have to take a break from working on the game (despite not having released an update for months) and them releasing it.\n\nUpdate 29 June 2015: With no further work done on the game and issues outstanding since it first hit steam I cannot recommend this game at all unless you buy it on deep discount and are aware it has problems such as: no windowed mode, references to tapping and drawing with fingers left over from mobile port, game doesn't exit when you ext it so you have to kill it with task manager, game creates massive number of "ffdshow" taskbar icons while running etc.\n\n\nUpdate 21 May 2015: Devs have issued statement that they won't be able to work on the pc version for a while due to "circumstances". Given the complete lack of progress for ages on the title anyway I would say the game is abandoned at this point. I am therefore changing my recommendation to thumbs down. For the record it was on 52/107 (49%) found helpful before I changed it.\n\nUpdate 27 Jan 2015: Although my review still stands, development on this title has been very, very slow. It's clear that it's not being worked on anything like full time. More like "a couple of hours on a weekend once a month if you are lucky". There are bugs which have been reported from when it first launched that are not being fixed. The dev adds more content but doesn't fix these issues: no ability to run windowed, creates lots of ffdshow icons isn systray, game doesn't exit when you exit so you have to kill it with task manager.\n\nIt is fun now, but I wouldn't bank on it changing much or the bugs in it ever being fixed. For some people this means crashing or unable to actually run the thing.\n\nOriginal review follows:\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have been around those areas of the web dedicated to free games you have probably seen a lot of what are termed "Falling Sand" games. Basically you have a blank screen and can "draw" pixels on it. For example you set your brush to 'sand' and hold the mouse button down: many pixels appear on the screen and fall down with gravity. Other elements behave differently and elements react with each other; you have things like fire, ice, water, TNT, acid, steam etc.\n\nThe main difference between this and other falling sand games are the missions. It's like if you got a falling sand game and added stuff like from those incredible contraption machine games (or Bad Rats haha). There are quite a lot of missions in total, plus a user gallery which is already quite full since this has been released on iOS for a while.\n\nIn this Falling Sand game you've got your familiar elements like fire, virus, sand, water etc., then you have some electronic/logic type stuff like power, metal, LEDs, detectors etc. for building minecraft like creations. You then have some more "god game" type ones (that do feature in some of the online falling sand games too) like clouds, plants that grow and people. You can turn the people into a variety of job-themed things like builder or miner that alters their behaviour so you get a kind of lemmings thing going on. Some of the elements don't do anything though, like purely decorative ones, basically like bitmap stamps.\n\nI have The Powder Toy which is free, for windows which is a better simulator with more elements and a higher resolution but I still bought this because there's something cute about the lower resolution, the fact it plays sounds when you add elements, and the interactive things like people.\n\nThere's nothing else like it on Steam and I recommend it.","April 24, 2014","false","35.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Don't expect to get entirely addicted to it; it's not that big of a game like Garry's Mod would be, but it is fun to play when you're bored. If you like pixel sandbox games, this game isn't really much more than a graphics update on the old falling sand games, but, I liked those games. It also has cool stuff such as playable arcade game "characters" or a ninja. There are also people who you need to give jobs in order to help them survive, etc. But, don't expect TOO much from an Ipad app port, though. This wasn't made for super gaming computers.","July 24, 2015","true","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Although to most people, it's only fun for the first hour or so. I was excited after burning the trees down, lighting volcanos, inventing heaters, and such. But finishing inventions that require metal boxes, electros, power sources, and bulbs are way too far.

Its a good game, the pixels can remind you of an old Atari game. Its a fun little sandbox, with many elements to play with. The story teaches you how to play, letting you have fun while it does so. The only problems I found were that the Humans are too slow with no walking or climbing animation, as well as the problem of them never tweaking the things told to you. It tells you the controls based on the IOS Version, not the PC version. It never tells you what keys to use/mouse buttons, only to swipe or touch with your finger, which you cant do unless you have a touchscreen PC(Which I don't even know if that would work). Overall, its an OK port of the IOS Version, but I am sorry to say it may not be very popular on the PC. Oh, one thing I really liked, no more ingame purchases, you get a lot of Mana in the beginning and you can earn more. You never really spend much Mana either, as everything is pretty cheap. Like I said, pretty good game overall, but it may not become popular due to it not reaching todays standards. I'm sure some people would like a good ol' pixelated Sandbox Game though.","June 1, 2014","true","2.4"," 17 of 36 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","17","36","0","0"

And yes.. it is Early Access.... But most Early Access games are far better for the same price....\n\n\nEDIT: For that one who wanted more details. So I try.\nIt starts with "The acclaimed world-building game". I would Name it more a world-drawing game. You can put some pixels together, and they "work" in different Ways... but on a low Level... It doesnt look too good. But thats even ok, becuase it can be also a conscious design decision. But this makes a game also look simple and cheaper in production. And even with this few special Pixels. It is just Paint... Paint with Physics... Basic Physics.... If you want to teach somebody science, take another game... if you want to be god. Take another game. If you want Paint Plus, it is perfect.\n\nBut even in Paint, you could make big and small pictures. In that game you can't make a big World. I hopped to be able to scroll to the left and right, but no... you really have just that small picture.\n\nThan the Humans... they are really stupid... (example) it is a  "if wood, do cut" human wo do his task until it doesnt work anymore.... And if there are more than 2/3 Humans... they sometimes doesnt even are able to pass there another by. They dont start working with each other. And oh, there is something that want to kill us. Lets just wait and stay... Maybe it doesnt see us.....\n\nThe last thing is that this game just crashes a lot... and totaly random and unexpected. Ok.... Early Access...\n\nBut what i think, is that most of the things above are a wanted design. Somebody said hey, that would make fun, i want that game (maybe for myself and then he sold it), lets look what happens. And this is absolutly ok! We dont need everywhere a AAA game. But what really *****, and so... I come back to my review... it would be ok for 2,99€... No Problem. Lets just have some fun with it. And some will play it never again, other had nice 20min. But not for 10€!!!! If you compare it to other games for that price, than sorry, but they are bigger, or you see that there ist an Idea that maybe someday it will become big, or just great. But this Game is already nearly finished... If not, maybe you should write down where you want to go, what you want to accomplish like the Spacebase DF-9 did.","April 22, 2014","false","3.4"," 28 of 78 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","28","78","0","10"

It appears that this game was very quickly ported from some other platform.  It has bad stability problems.  For example, certain campaign levels reliably crash the game within 30 seconds (e.g. alien invasion campaign, level 9).\n\nOn the other hand the game is cool.   You can build whatever you want... Rube Goldberg machines, circuits, landscapes, pixel art.  The campaigns vary in quality, but it is impressive that the game engine lends itself to such a variety of campaigns.

It appears that this game was very quickly ported from some other platform.  It has bad stability problems.  For example, certain campaign levels reliably crash the game within 30 seconds (e.g. alien invasion campaign, level 9).\n\nOn the other hand the game is cool.   You can build whatever you want... Rube Goldberg machines, circuits, landscapes, pixel art.  The campaigns vary in quality, but it is impressive that the game engine lends itself to such a variety of campaigns.  Honestly, most of the campaign levels are kind of silly.","January 25","false","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
