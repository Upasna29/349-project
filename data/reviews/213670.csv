The whole way through, the experience feels like watching a really good South Park episode or South Park movie, and the game is a *really* solid RPG, to boot.\n\nBut the game isn't without its flaws.  I want to spend a few paragraphs on some criticisms of the game, and then we'll talk about what makes the game awesome.\n\nThe game feels heavily "consolized."  Loading screens are far more frequent than they should be and the controls often don't make much sense.  Throughout the game your character will be taught "magic spells" from various NPCs.  Each time you learn a spell, you are taught a series of controls to use that spell.  However, these spells can be used both in and out of combat, and in both situations the controls are different from one another—and in neither situation is the spell invoked the same way the game inititally taught you!\n\nYour out-of-combat utilities (like firing a ranged weapon at something in the environment or sending a buddy to perform a task) are equally awkward to select and use.\n\nNow, here I should note that I played with a controller attached to a PC.  I started the game with a keyboard/mouse but changed very, very early on to give my normal gaming posture a rest (I play games a lot with the keyboard/mouse), and also because South Park: The Stick of Truth seemed to be tailored more toward a controller.  Perhaps the controls are better with a keyboard/mouse, but using a controller felt awkward in many parts of the game.  But not in combat.  In combat the controls felt great.  More on that later, though.\n\nOn top of that, the game's humor can be off-putting in some parts.  This isn't a real criticism so much as it is a warning—it IS South Park, after all!  The show has a reputation of making comedy material out of even the most sensitive of topics, and this game also doesn't hold back.  I like to think of myself as a fairly easy-going guy and I try not to take many things too seriously, but there were parts in this game that I felt myself somewhat rushing through or avoiding just to get away from an uncomfortable topic.\n\nThere's a lot of back-and-forth running around the map in this game, and loading screens are absolutely everywhere.  The loading screens are a real slowdown.\n\nSo let's see.  The loading screens, the really iffy controls in much of the game, and the warning about how the game remains very South Park in its humor are all the things I wanted to make sure to mention.  So, now we can talk about the stuff that makes this game a fantastic one!\n\nWhile moving on the map and navigating menus is often awkward with the game's controls, combat is something the game gets very, very right.  As I mentioned earlier, this game is a very solid RPG, and The Stick of Truth's turn-based combat is airtight.  This isn't your typical "select an ability and watch what happens" kind of turn-based combat.  Here, you'll select an ability, and then you'll influence the outcome of the ability with some simple, but fun controls.\n\nFor example, Butters the Paladin has a "Hammer of Justice" ability.  To use it, you select it and then choose a target.  The game then has you rotate the left control stick in circles to make Butters spin (think Olympic discus tossing), and at just the right instant, press the A button.  Succeed, and you'll deal bonus damage to the enemy!  If you mess up, Butters will still deal damage, but not as much.  Again, this is coming from the perspective of using a gamepad to control the game; I'm sure this is different for a mouse/keyboard, but the principle is the same.\n\nCombat is filled with awesome stuff like this.  When you are attacked, most of the time you are given the chance to block some of the enemy's damage by pressing A at just the right time.  Some enemy attacks strike multiple times, requiring multiple well-timed blocks!  Different enemy attacks have different timings as well, so you'll always need to be on your guard.\n\nThese combat mechanics make even turn-based combat a very active affair.  The action is fast and challenging, so you'll need to be spot on with your controls.  Thankfully, controls in combat are responsive and intuitive, and anytime there's some ambiguity about what to do in battle, there are useful tooltips and pop-ups to remind you of how to use an ability.\n\nWhile combat is great fun, the game also very often presents you with multiple ways of dealing with foes.  Sometimes you can distract them and sneak by.  Other times you can use the environment to defeat your foes without having to confront them.  Keen awareness of your surroundings and appropriate use of your abilities out of combat can speed up your progress and yield satisfying results.\n\nIt should be noted that if you sneak by enemies, you probably won't get experience for dealing with them.  But in the cases where you can use the environment to defeat them, you'll be awarded experience as if you had battled them!\n\nThere are many quests to accomplish throughout the game, and a few side quests can be completed as you progress.  As far as questing is concerned, it's your typical RPG fare—pick up a quest, complete the objectives, turn the quest in.  The game does nothing to revolutionize questing, but it handles questing very well.\n\nThe story-based quests, however, are always greatly satisfying to accomplish because you are awarded not only with experience and often loot/money, but also with story exposition done in only the way South Park can.  It really does feel like you're earning a little piece of a South Park episode or South Park movie when you complete a story quest.\n\nThe writing in the game is spot on.  You'll get to watch the South Park characters you're so familiar with do the things they do, in the way they do them, while interacting with one another and with your character.  I found the story largely fun and interesting.\n\nI was often quite pleased with the developers' efforts to include as many South Park characters as they could in the game.  This could not have been an easy task to accomplish, but the game is solid through-and-through with the show's characters, and because the show has been running so long, these characters bring with them their histories, backdrops, and references that the South Park fan should thoroughly enjoy.\n\nCharacter customization is very in-depth for a game with such a simplistic visual style.  You'll begin the game by choosing a class, and then customizing your looks.  As the game progresses, you will find, like, a bajillion different ways to customize your charcter's costume ("gear"), hair, facial features, makeup, and accessories.  You'll even find "strap-ons" (for weapons) and "patches" (for armor) that let you add significant bonuses to your gear, letting you really specialize or round out your character and playstyle.\n\nI did make a warning above about the game's humor, but for South Park fans, that (most of the time) means you're in for more of what you enjoy about the show.  There were plenty of times I found myself actually laughing out loud at the characters' antics; or at the writing; or at the timing of a joke; or just at South Park being South Park.  It's a funny game.\n\nThere is also a difficulty slider bar.  Early in the game I cranked the difficulty to max and didn't look back, and for me, it was quite rewarding.  The window of opportunity to block enemy attacks seemed drastically smaller, necessitating more precise timing, and enemies often didn't go down without a fight.  I had to stay on top of my gear choices and customize appropriately.  Which buddy to bring into battle with me was also a serious consideration, and more than once I had to stock up on potions.\n\nOverall, it's just a really solid RPG, and I'd strongly recommend it to any South Park fan.  I could go on about it, but I feel I've covered most of the relevant aspects of the game, and apparently Steam has a character limit for reviews.  :)","November 7, 2014","true","20.1"," 1,237 of 1,369 people (90%) found this review helpful 53 people found this review funny","90","237","1","53","7"

See Conclusion\nNOTE:I have played this game extensively when my internet was down (which was 3 days long) so Steam did not record my game time. Steam does not record game time while offline and if I remember correctly I should have 10-11 hours clocked in.\n\nINTRODUCTION:South Park: The Stick of Truth is a 2014 role-playing game based on the popular TV show South Park. The game was developed by Obsidian Entertainment, and surprisingly enough, published by Ubisoft in one of those occasions where they release a game that is not broken or tied to Uplay. Good job Ubisoft!\n\nPLOT (No Spoilers):The story takes place in the town of South Park where you, the player, take on the role of the 'new kid' who holds a mysterious power of making friends really fast. Upon arriving, you quickly learn about an ongoing 'Battle' (game) between the Human forces of Cartman and the Drow Elves loyal to Kyle for the control of an artifact of limitless power called 'The Stick of Truth'.\n\nPROS:+ Great art style that mimics the TV Series with great accuracy making the game feel more like an episode of the TV show rather than a video game.\n+ High resolution art works and good animations\n+ Great sound design that remains true to the TV series' quality\n+ Wonderful voice acting featuring the original cast and Adolf Hitler[www.imdb.com]\n+ Good old fashion South Park humor (See NEUTRAL #2)\n+ Very fun and well integrated gameplay mechanics\n+ Good amount of Easter eggs from the TV Show\n+ Excellent overall presentation starting from the character creation screen until the end credits\n+ Excellent Story\n+ Fun Canada mini-game\n+ Good amount of character customization however...(See CON #2)\n+ No Uplay account needed\n\nCONS:- Gameplay becomes repetitive after a while\n- Very limited armor & weapon customization and selection\n- No crafting mechanic to fix the above CON\n- Useless DLC items\n\nNEUTRAL:+/- Excusable 30 fps lock because it works well with the graphics, gameplay and artstyle\n+/- The South Park toilet and black/dark humor may not appeal to everyone (so if you don't like South Park to begin with, you will probably not like this game as well.)\n+/- The story is fairly linear but the presentation makes it feel as if it was open world\n\nCONCLUSION:EXCELLENT game for South Park fans all around. This game preserves the look and feel of the series while integrating very fun and entertaining gameplay mechanics that would rival even some of the much more established RPG games.\n\nWORTH IT?:I can RECOMMEND this game at its full price only if you're a South Park fan because chances are, any fan of the series would fully appreciate all the extra content and easter eggs from the show.  However, if you're not a fan of the series but don't particularly hate it, get the game during a sale. If you hate the series and/or you're easily offended / triggered by dark / toilet humor I would not recommend purchasing this game.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

This review is also available in video format if you scroll down.)\n\nSince 1997, South Park has graced television with its profane, unabashed, and satiric humor.  With its success it has managed to become a part of American culture and spawn a full length movie and several video games along the way but none are quite up to level as South Park: The Stick of Truth.\n\nWith the help of Obsidian Entertainment, Matt Stone and Trey Parker have created the most accurate transfer of an intellectual property to games ever made.  That being said, this is a game made with longtime fans of the series in mind.  If you're not a fan of the show, or don't appreciate its style of humor your experience may differ drastically from the intended audiences.\n\nThe Stick of Truth picks up shortly after the trilogy events of Season 17.  After an initial character creation screen you wake up as “the new kid” in South Park. Upon leaving your house, you'll befriend your neighbor, Butters, and venture on over to Cartman's house where he and Kenny, along with an ensemble of South Park regulars, are role-playing as a warring fantasy faction of humans that guard a sacred relic known as the Stick of Truth.  After a brief introduction and Cartman honoring you with a chosen name his kingdom is assaulted by a band of elves who manage to steal the holy object.  As in typical South Park fashion, the small and insignificant somehow manages to eventually involve the whole town and powers beyond as the story snowballs you through the town's workings, aliens, government interference, and of course... Nazi zombies.\n\nOne thing that's blatantly obvious from early on is that this isn't cable television's South Park.  This is a humor much more akin to the 1999 South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut, except on steroids and about 15 hours long, which is relatively short for a game of this genre.  Much of the humor is crude and meant to be insulting, but fans of the show will find it quite satisfying. The South Park writers were really on their A game and the show makes constant references to its own history, from every single piece of junk you pick up to who or what is in each of the boy's closets.  The amount of detail and respect this game has for the source material is really quite amazing. Its visual style makes you feel like you're actually playing the show and people walking by may not know the difference.\n\nThe game play involves you picking one of four classes, each with their own unique playing-styles. The combat plays out similarly to most JRPGs with a turn-based system that rewards timed button presses similar to Super Mario RPG.  You’re also able to choose one of six companions to follow you at different points of the game each with their own distinct abilities.  It's a streamlined but fun system that forces you to pay attention while you play, although its simplicity doesn't offer much in the way of a challenge.  Occasionally you'll also be presented opportunities in which combat can be avoided or reduced by taking advantage of the environment around the foe.  It's a great feature to have, as with most turn-based RPGs, combat isn't the high point and creates a nice rewarding dynamic when you see an opportunity to kill an enemy without direct confrontation.\n\nTo offset the impressively accurate paper cut out visuals, Stick of Truth employs a very serious orchestral soundtrack.  You'll frequently be reminded of Game of Thrones and Skyrim while listening. Its contrast to the material creates a great comedic effect. The voice acting remains true to the show, with Matt and Trey supplying most of the voice work, often with the same voices for different characters, with the Nazi's having an effectively hilarious voice track.\n\nWhile the content provided is an impressive representation of South Park, its accuracy raises the expectations enough so that when something from the series doesn't show up, it can be a bit disappointing. Some characters and locations are missing and one can’t help but think they were deliberately left out to allow for DLC and/or a sequel.\n\nSouth Park: The Stick of Truth is a great game for people who appreciate the show or have a similar taste in humor.  It can be a bit polarizing but that's to be expected with a title such as this.  The writing is rich and full of references that fans will truly appreciate, but sometimes, as with the show some of the jokes can get old at times. Luckily however, there are enough jokes in this game to be thoroughly enjoyable throughout its somewhat brief duration. A relatively easy difficulty, and lack of post-game content and a somewhat questionable quest reward system, where you'll frequently get items well after they've had any use to you can cause a bit of tedium to set in. The gameplay holds its own, it doesn't do anything new or amazing but the charm that saturates every aspect of it makes it feel special. This is, hands down, the best South Park game ever made.  If you're looking for the definitive South Park experience, waiting for season 18 or just want to laugh, this is the game for you.\n\nTLDR? Here's a video my friend and I put together:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14c4uo2bQA8\n\nPros:\n\n+ Honors the source material\n+ Great writing\n+ Looks exactly like the show\n+ Always present personality\n+ Best South Park Game Ever Made\n\nCons:\n\n- Combat is a bit easy and simple\n- Short length when compared to most RPGs (Around 15 hours)\n- Need to be a fan of the show to fully appreciate it\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/4886473/","March 3, 2014","true","30.6"," 1,594 of 1,964 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","594","1","0","34"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/213670/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Much like the beloved TV show, South Park: The Stick of Truth is ridiculous, over-the-top, and crude. South Park has taken its shots at the world of video games before, but never with this kind of reverence. At the same time, the game is a celebration of seventeen seasons of the show, drawing references from fan favorites across the entire span of its run. Amazingly enough, the South Park stuff aside, it's actually a really good RPG as well.\nSouth Park: The Stick of Truth puts players in the role of the new kid in town. He and his parents just moved to the quiet, Colorado mountain town in order to get away from some bad thing that happened that he has conveniently forgotten about. After being shooed out the door by his parents and told to go make some friends, he discovers that the children of the town are embroiled in what has to be the most amazing LARPing session of all time, all to decide who controls the miraculous Stick of Truth, which gives its bearer control over the universe. He naturally gets drawn into the game, but behind the scenes, the weirdness of South Park is at an all time high. Aliens, secret government organizations, underpants gnomes, nazis, zombies, nazi zombies, and Al Gore all threaten to bring the town to the brink of destruction, unless the new kid can become cool.\nIt should come as no surprise that Stick of Truth looks and feels just like an episode of South Park. The game begins with a terrific character customizer that allows players to generate their own nine-year old kid in the South Park style. Some players may be disappointed to learn that only male characters can be created, but there are story reasons for this, and rest assured, the girls of South Park get their day in the sun as well. Similar to Fallout 3, the appearance of the new kid determines the appearance of his parents as well. The town of South Park has been faithfully recreated, including the vast majority of landmarks seen throughout the show's seventeen-season run, including Jimbo's Guns, Skeeter's Bar, City Wok, South Park Elementary, City Hall, and even Canada. The story possesses unique elements, but also draws from the show's history for events, side quests, and even the miscellaneous junk items.\nOf course, exploring South Park isn't as easy as it looks. There are a number of places the new kid won't be able to get to, at least not right away. There are locked doors that require keys to open, and rooftops and small spaces that require special abilities to access. In fact, the interactivity of the environment is one of the game's strongest aspects, and even plays a role in combat. By using the various special abilities at the new kid's disposal, as well as the special abilities of his friends, players can find multiple routes through the game's areas, and even make combat easier by defeating enemies beforehand, sometimes in surprisingly ridiculous ways.\nStick of Truth's combat involves simple but engaging turn-based battles reminiscent of the Paper Mario series. Near the beginning of the game, players can choose one of four classes — the fighter, the mage, the thief, and the jew — and each class has its own special skillset. Each class learns five special moves that can be used by consuming power points, and can spend points earned each level to upgrade their power. In addition, the new kid can also summon powerful beings like Jesus and Mr. Slave to assist in battle, and harness the magical power of... his farts. He can also bring a single ally into battle, though they can be switched out on the fly at the cost of a single turn.\nOnce battle begins, combat takes place turn by turn, "just like in medieval times." The new kid and his ally can perform one healing ability and one attack ability each turn. All attack skills require some sort of timed button input to perform effectively, though they are mostly very easy to perform, and the ones that require a bit more finesse are still plenty powerful even if the player fails.\nUnfortunately, the game tends to be rather easy most of the time. This is partly compounded by the ease of which players can gain experience. The game caps out at level fifteen, and if players are ardent about completing side quests and exploring the town, the new kid will reach this cap well before the end of the game. The game is much more challenging in the first few hours than it is later on, despite an adjustable difficulty setting. That said, the ease of play is still dictated by successfully performing attacks in combat, and a string of bad inputs can quickly change the tide, right up until the end of the game.\nPlayers can also collect a huge assortment of weapons, armor, augmentation items, and accessories like wigs, make-up, and glasses to further customize their character. The number of customization options are mind-boggling, so players should have no trouble making their character their own. Players can also get permanent passive bonuses to various combat functions by earning perks. Perks are earned by gaining facebook friends in the town.\nOne of the most surprisingly excellent aspects of South Park: The Stick of Truth is its audio. The fantastic voice talents of Trey Parker and Matt Stone are certainly wonderful on their own, but an even greater surprise is the music. Not only are there some terrific orchestral pieces that help set the tone, the game is filled to the brim with the goofier songs from the series' history, often playing on radios scattered throughout the town or during particular battle sequences.\nSome players may wish to be cautious, however, as even by South Park standards, Stick of Truth is particularly crude. Not since the 1999 film South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut has South Park pushed the boundaries of good taste as far as they have here. Players will engage in battle beneath the bodies of two people making sweet, sweet love, perform an abortion, and delve deep inside a man's ♥♥♥♥♥♥. There are alien anal probes and just about every bodily function imaginable, and anyone who is even remotely offendable should stay far, far away.\nThe best thing about South Park: The Stick of Truth is the little things that help bring the town to life. Fans of South Park are definitely not going to be disappointed, and fans of RPGs won't be either. Although the game is fairly short, the quality of the experience is undeniable, and the humor and multiple classes give it a fair bit of replayability as well. And as Obsidian games go, it's also one of the most stable. I didn't encounter a single issue. It took a while to get here, but the wait was well worth it: South Park: The Stick of Truth is sweet.","August 25, 2015","true","240.4"," 161 of 177 people (91%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","91","161","177","21","0"

I don't think there is anywhere else to go.\n\nSETUP\nYou are the new kid in South Park and all your favorite characters are here. (voiced by the real actors of the show) As the new kid you are told by your parents to get out of your room by your parents and make some friends. You leave your home and are met by Butters and he introduces you to Cartman and the kingdom of humans. Calling themselves the Kingdom of Kupa Keep. Unfortunately this name has the acronym of KKK. Which is clearly the joke but I thought I'd mention it anyways.\n\nAfter meeting Cartman, you get to choose 1 of 4 classes to play as; Mage, Warrior, Thief, or Jew. I played as a thief and as far as I can tell the only thing this effects is the equipment awarded at specific stages in the game and of course your special abilities. Upon choosing your class and getting a basic tutorial of how combat works you are told about the Stick of Truth and the LARP'ing begins. Though as you may have suspected, its not all fun and games. Things take a pretty serious turn even given South Parks satirical nature.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThis borrows from the likes of Paper Mario and the newer Costume Quest. Turn-based combat while timing button presses to, on defense mitigate the amount of damage taken and on offense, increase the damage or in some cases hit at all. Your character has abilities based on your class which have specific interactions in order to be the most effective. There are also summons which you can earn from completing side quests.\n\nEach weapon is different, the effects as well as the way it attacks. Same goes for equipment. A nice touch is that there is no restrictions for class on clothing or weapons but it kind of breaks the role-playing bit, at least in my opinion.\n\nIn The Stick of Truth you can customize your appearance; however it seems to not be entirely important as you can change your appearance with wigs, makeup and a number of other items that are available in the game. You cannot play as a female as there is a narrative reason why this is not an option.\n\nThe game is surprisingly open world, not in the sense of being able to truly influence the world in the way you see fit (the narrative is very concise and pulls you toward the end regardless) but it allows you do side quests and actually rewards you for exploring. I remember multiple times having gone into someones house or down a sewer pipe on a whim and being given multiple new quests to complete as well as finding many new items I would have never found otherwise.\n\nTHE GIST\nGreat fun little RPG especially if you already like South Park. To be honest I don't watch the show regularly but I was familiar enough to know all the main characters and even some of the obscure ones. But I'd guess even knowing nothing going in its still very easy to follow. I'm sure I missed some of the deep cuts of fan-service but the jokes stand on their own regardless.","November 30, 2015","true","12.6"," 130 of 137 people (95%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","95","130","137","13","0"

For fans of the show, it's hard to imagine a better use of the license. The designers didn't play it safe and crap out a generic game just to cash in. They took a great hook that was already built into the show (the kids of South Park™ live role-playing RPG-style) and ran with it. This is not a hard-core 100+ hour type of RPG, nor should it have been. Instead, it employs a more simplified style that requires timed button presses for attacks and defense. As a reference point, the gameplay is very similar to the "Mario & Luigi"™ RPGs. This is not only a very good thing, but it also perfectly serves the source material. So while the "RPG" aspects of the game are not particularly hardcore, there is just enough depth to keep it (mostly) interesting throughout. What really take the game to a higher level are the production values. The game itself looks and sounds exactly like the newer HD episodes of the series. Just about every character you could possibly care about makes an appearance, and they're all voiced and written exactly as you would expect. Absolutely no corners were cut in this department - the game really makes you feel as if you are in South Park™, interacting with its characters. The story is also exactly what you would expect out of South Park™. Although the basic premise is very simple - the boys fighting over an ordinary stick™ - the story ultimately progresses in ways you could never have imagined (or perhaps you can, if you've watched enough of the series over the years). The dialogue and voice acting are excellent, and there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments from beginning to end. There are also tons of obscure references and cameos throughout, seemingly for no other purpose than to make the most hard-core fans chuckle. The whole game really is just a huge South Park™ love fest. In terms of difficulty, the default setting is fine, if a bit on the easy side. If you want more (or less) of a challenge, you can change the difficulty at any point, which is a great feature that should allow anyone to complete it if they put in the time.\n\nUnfortunately, along with all of the things that make the game good, there are also a few low points. Several sections involve slightly complicated "quick time events" (not exactly in the traditional sense, but used here for lack of a better term). Setting aside the fact that these sections seem randomly out of place in an otherwise good game, the real issue is that they just aren't implemented well. The tutorials for each action are executed poorly, which can be frustrating if you don't pick up on what the game is asking you to do, exactly. Another low point comes towards the latter portion of the game, which involves a series of "fetch-quests". While I am sure the intent of this section was to lampoon this tired video game trope, they succeeded a little too much, as it started to get fairly tedious. It also didn't help that at this point in the game, I had already maxed out my character's level, so there was really nothing else to strive for, in an "RPG" sense. It would have been nice if there was no level cap, with enemies scaled to your strength (or something along those lines). Lastly, and this is just a pet peeve of mine, but apparently there are several collectibles that can be missed if you don't get them the first time through - just a warning to those who enjoy collecting things or 100%-ing games.\n\nOverall, my annoyances with the game are fairly minor in comparison to all of the things I enjoyed. If you are a huge South Park™ fan, I think this is a no-brainer. The amount of care that went into making it is readily apparent, and worthy of your money (at least, now that it's only $40 - the original $60 price point was way too much). In terms of length, it's hard for me to estimate, but I would say it will probably take you anywhere from 11-18 hours, depending on how deliberate/OCD you are. It's really hard for me to imagine a South Park™ game ever being done better than this. Needless to say, non-fans should stay away. But for anyone else (assuming you can get into the simple RPG gameplay), it's definitely worth checking out at some point.","September 7, 2014","true","19.5"," 187 of 225 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","187","225","4","0"

You will really love the cutscenes and story if you are a South Park fan, and the game is pretty fun too.\n\nPros:\nGreat cutscenes, lots of jokes and lots of easter eggs from South Park. Most south park characters will make an appearance in the game and it's always a good chuckle. This game is really like an extra long episode or even a second movie.\nFun gameplay. In this game you do three things, you fight enemies in small turn based battles that are kind of like pokemon, the battles sound like they would be boring but they are actually quite fun since you have to use the right moves and need to time them perfectly. The second thing you do is explore south park searching for treasure, collectibles or easter eggs. Lastly you customise your character (a new kid to South Park) and dress him up in funny costums or with weapons and weapon patches that come with different bonuses.\nBattles are much better than you would expect, the battles are turn based and are very fun. You can use ranged weapons, melee weapons, magic (farts) or special abilities. You can set your enemis on fire, stun them, gross them out and send them to sleep. My favourite attack in the game is the Roshambo where you kick your enemy in the nuts! You also have companions with their own special abilities and playstyle.\nThe story is also good. In the beginning you are playing a pretend fantasy game and all the boys in South Park are on one side or the other but later you need to fight a much bigger threat to the town. The fact that you start out playing a game within a game is pretty funny and the characters often reference it.\nThe game is very well paced. It takes place over about 4 days, during the day time you do missions for the South park boys but at night time you do these huge boss missions. The game doesn't get boring and neither does the story as it quickly progresses. Certain secret areas of South Park also become avaliabe as you progress so you never really stop exploring.\nStyle. The art style of the game is very good. It looks exactly like South Park does. Cutscenes are indistinguishable from South Park and the mini cutscenes for each character's special ability are very well done. The UI in batles looks nice and is easy to understand, as is the ingame menu where you customise your inventory, abilities and perks.\n\nCons:\n\nThe humour of the game is the same as South Park, it's very crude and vulgar. If (like me) you love South Park then you will love that kind of humour. But if you are not a South Park fan or have never watched it you might not enjoy the humour.\nSometimes the objectives of missions aren't very well explained and you sometimes become lost when you don't know what to do, meaning that you have to google search the answer.\nThe game is quite short and you should expect to finish it in a few days. I completed pretty much everything there is to do in the game in about 15 hours. I don't know if that is worth €30 so you should wait to pick it up on sale. (That's what I did and I got it for €7, which is great value).","November 11, 2015","true","17.5"," 72 of 76 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","72","76","7","0"

I love it. The turn based RPG system fits so well with the animation. This is the game that south park fans deserve. I'll go over the positive aspects and the negative aspects.\n\nPositive:\n-This game is incredibly funny. It's raunchy and dirty sense of humor fits me so well. I love it. However, if you are not into that kind of humor, this game will not appeal to you.\n-The turned based combat would sound bad, and boring... But it actually has you involved. You don't just choose a move and then watch it play out. It's kind of like the Mario rpg games, where you have to put in some sort of actions to make a "Perfect" hit. The combat is also fairly fleshed out. There are status effects that can be inflicted on enemies. Also the unique ways each buddy can be used to suit your play style. You can even use the enviroment outside of combat using your abilities you get, such as your fart magic, and an anal alien probe. Skipping combat completely, but getting the experience.\n-Plenty to explore, and has some replayability. Although I never completed it after doing it twice.\n-It is creatively written. The story line is fantastic. Which it should be, being written by the developers of the show themself.\n-Due to the kids larping, it makes some creative items. You can literally take a crap in a toilet, and throw it at an enemy to gross them out.\n-The story line and all side missions can give you around... 20 hours, even more if you want to replay it.\n\nNegative:\nThe negative aspects are just me nit picking a bit, but some of these can be an issue for others.\n-This game is for south park fans, and for people who are not easily offended. If you are not a south park fan? You might not enjoy this game, and not get most of the jokes.\n-The game is too easy on the default difficulty, and even on hard mode, it can be easy. I've found myself never losing a single battle when you follow the story line.\n-20 hours is a VERY short rpg game, when it ends, you just want more!!","March 5, 2015","true","16.9"," 76 of 85 people (89%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","89","76","85","9","0"

Unfortunately, we live in an age where many good video games have such huge budgets that developers and publishers aren’t willing to take a risk on a new franchise, instead churning out poorly-made games based on franchises and preying on the fans of the franchise.\n\nThis is not one of those cases. Though it had a somewhat tumultuous development cycle, the end product is a fantastic representation of everything that’s great about the South Park series. If you’re a fan of the series, or at least its style of humour, this is a no-brainer. For others that have never been impressed with the juvenile and tasteless jokes ubiquitous throughout the South Park universe, I’d recommend that you avoid this title. This isn’t because the gameplay can’t hold a candle on its own – It can, and it was a fun romp in its own right. It’s more that the developers spent so much effort on building the perfect South Park game and added as many of their well-renowned politically incorrect humour that it becomes unavoidable if it isn’t your thing.\n\nStoryline\nThe game begins with you, (“D-bag”) and your parents moving into South Park, Colorado. You’re then tasked with making friends in the new town, which isn't easy given that your protagonist is mysteriously silent throughout the game. Before long, you’ll find yourself involved in a real-life role playing game with the other kids in South Park. There are two factions – The humans, led by Cartman, and the elves, led by Kyle. Both factions fight over a stick – the titular Stick of Truth, which supposedly possesses the power to control the universe. Throughout your journey, you’ll encounter numerous (and often ridiculous) obstacles and hazards and meet a tonne of infamous characters from the South Park franchise and an even greater number of references to events that have occurred in the TV show.\n\nFans of the series who have seen the South Park episode “The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers” will find the setting very familiar. As in the episode, the characters don costumes representing their class and/or position (including a cross-dressing princess Kenny) and are deeply engrossed in their roles, but they do occasionally have to break out of character in order to satisfy their real-life commitments, which more often than not involves the parents telling them that it’s time for bed.\n\nGameplay\nThe game itself resembles other turn-based, quick time event (QTE)-heavy RPGs such as Paper Mario and the dreaded Costume Quest. Battles aren’t random, but rather are usually initiated by walking into an enemy. During each battle, you’re given a party of up to two characters (your main character and a character that you can choose and switch between). Each character has its own unique set of attacks and abilities. For each action that you choose, there’s an associated QTE action that you have to perform perfectly in order to maximise the effect. This often includes pressing a certain button at some point in time, mashing another button, spinning the left control stick or some combination of the above. Unlike in Costume Quest where the timing of these was very lenient and forgiving even if you happened to miss it, The Stick of Truth requires you to be on your toes. The window of opportunity for pressing these buttons is fairly strict, and the consequences of missing button sequence can lead to severe consequences. For example, one of Kenny’s special abilities involves him calling a horde of rats. Once the rats appear, you’re required to rapidly and repeatedly pull your left control stick to the left and right. If you succeed, the rats swarm your enemies for significant amount of damage. Should you fail however, the rats will literally eat Kenny alive. When it’s your opponents turn to attack, you’re once again given a small window to press a button in order to defend their attack, which results in reduced damage or prevention of a negative status effect. Overall, actively pressing buttons at the correct time matters in this game, which adds a level of intensity to every battle. It’s a fantastic combat system that forces the player to be actively involved, rather than continuously mashing a single button and hoping for the best.\n\nWhist outside of battles, your character is freely able to roam around South Park, gathering quests and looking for loot (equipment, potions, cosmetic items or junk to sell), collectables (i.e. Chinpokomon) and even more friends to add to Facebook, which helps to unlock perks which will assist you in battle. Completing side quests usually rewards you with equipment, friends or even “summons” that you can call to battle when things get rough. The Mr. Slave summon ability literally causes him to violently shove an enemy up his butt for impressive, but disturbing results.\n\nThe game also gives you access to certain abilities that you can use to solve simple puzzles that are strewn across the game. Whilst some of these puzzles have to be solved in order to progress, many of these merely offer you an easier way to deal with enemies without actually fighting them in battle. If there’s a rock sitting on a ledge above your enemy, you can shoot it with a slingshot and have it drop on your enemies, which avoids the necessity of combat entirely. There are many more examples of manipulating the environment in order to gain an advantage or avoid combat entirely, but I'd hate to spoil the fun of discovering these for yourself. Overall, it’s a very refreshing and unique mechanic that’s highly welcome in a game where things may otherwise get stale.\n\nPresentation\nVisually, the game beautifully replicates the aesthetic that the show is famous for. It’s not mindblowing by any stretch of the imagination, but it’s just the way any fan of the show would want it to look.\n\nMore importantly, the developers, in conjunction with the creators of South Park, have done a wonderful job replicating the world of South Park.  Every building in town can be entered and interacted with. The game is chock-full of characters and/or references to characters or events from the series. The voice-acting is on-point, with the original voice actors of the show providing the voices of the characters. Characters have context-sensitive remarks. If Cartman is in your party and you walk into Kyle’s house, you bet he’ll mutter something about Jews and/or make a derogatory remark regarding Kyle’s mother. Ultimately, the game does a tremendous job at making you feel like you’re a part of the world that is South Park, and fans of the show really couldn’t ask for anything more than that. With that said, if you’re not a fan of the show or think it’s too vulgar, please turn away now. This game pulled no punches in vulgarity, and even as a long-time fan of the show, there are certain segments that I think are a little bit too disturbing or distasteful. Your mileage may vary.\n\nOverall\nAfter numerous delays, I’m happy to say South Park: The Stick of Truth is a tremendous title that successfully replicates both the humour and personality of the show, whilst providing a refined, tightly-controlled and satisfying combat system to boot. Whilst it's a solid game in its own right, your enjoyment of the overall experience will be very heavily influenced by just how much the humour that the show is famous for actually appeals to you. As a result, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone that hates the show, but would recommend it without questin to anyone that is a fan.","January 6, 2015","true","15.3"," 79 of 93 people (85%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","85","79","93","8","0"

Those are the only three words I can describe this great game.\n\nThe new kid is in town and is invited to Cartman's Human army. The stick of truth is stolen and must be retrieved but little did he know that his adventure is about to get even more epic as he retrieves the stick back from the elves. What went from just a kids imaginary war game to even something bigger was beyond anyone's comprehension.\n\nI beat the game in 15.6 hours finding almost every single sidequest of finding stuff and doing endgame bosses. There wasn't much after the game was done and was short on end game content but for the 15.6 hours of hilarity it was worth it along with collecting mini sidequests and other small sidequests. The voice acting is straight from the show, you'll feel like you're a part of the show. The music is also very well done and fits the game really nicely.\n\nThe gameplay is quite unique for it isn't just your usual rpg where you click a command and wait for your character to attack, you'll be doing attacks from mashing certain buttons, or pressing certain buttons in a certain order to execute skill abilities. Also the battle engine requires you to press something when a key symbol, shape, or color is seen.\n\nYou'll be picking from 4 classes, The Fighter, Mage, Thief, and Jew. Each with thier very own unique perks and abilities which makes it really fun.  The downside is there isn't really any stats to be messed with for your character. You'll basically outfit your character with gear which you can modify with patches on them granting you stats on each piece of your equipment. You can be literally anything you want by the end of the game and by that you'll be super powerful even in the hardest mode. Which I found is a - for me since the game only has 15 levels and it gets really easy to horde items and be all powerful making the game really easy even though the mobs sorta levels with you.\n\nInstead of a party of characters you have to manage you'll be playing with only one other buddy from southpark, There is a little variety of buddies you can pick from in your group but you can only switch them in and out of combat and also during combat when needed. Each with thier own attack + abilties but uncustomizable in any way or form. They level with you. This can get repetitive at time early on until you get buddies to join you.\n\nThe story from the beginning to end is hilarious and can get quite disguisting at some points. Try not to get too offended since these are only jokes to touch you. You'll also see and hear tons of pop reference from games and movies.\n\nAnyways the game was Epic and the ending was quite Epic and this is a game truly for those who are hardcore South Park fans. If you enjoy South Park jokes you'll also love this game, it is quite well done. You'll also like it if you just want some laughs.\n\n\n+15 or so hours of one giant pack show.\n+Of course voice acting is spot on!\n+Hilarious\n+Animation is exactly like being part of the show in fact looks even crispier!\n+The battle system is pretty fun and epic at times depending on the moves.\n+The epic nonsense of a story flowed REALLY well lol.\n+Great music\n\n+- South park jokes, if you don't enjoy them you won't like this game.\n+- Some parts will gross people out.\n\n- Not much replayability since all you can do is choose different class or pick a different branch in the story which doesn't really change the path in anyways since it all comes together the same.\n- Battle can get repetitive\n- Not much customization, gear based game with item buffs.\n- More end game content would been nice.\n","March 4, 2014","true","18.7"," 140 of 185 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","140","185","0","0"

Even though the game is rather short, has little variety in the player classes and is light on RPG mechanics, these shortcomings are more than made-up with the very well-written story, excellent voice acting, well-timed satire and faithfulness to the TV series.  I would have to say this game is among the best license adaptations I have ever seen.\n\nIf you are not a South Park fan, easily disgusted or offended, or are looking for a deep RPG experience then you may want to wait for a sale or pass on this one.  If you are a fan of the series this is a must-have experience that cannot be missed.\n\nOn a final note, this game is also the definitive Fart Simulator.  Be ready to FART. ON.

All graphics and details are made just like in the series, and that is totally awesome. As if you're just watching another episode of South Park, but this time you get to be part of it as the 'New Kid'.\n\nControls (5/5) - Nothing much to say here, but nothing game breaking bugs so far.\n\nGameplay (5/5) - If you're not aware yet, this game is a JRPG-like game. And I'll be honest, of all my time playing computer games, I never had that much 'fun' playing these type of games. But this one is truly an exception.\n\nEntertainment (4.7/5) - Another confession... I HAVE NEVER EVER WATCHED A SOUTH PARK SERIES NOT UNTIL I PLAYED THIS GAME. But given that circumstance, I gave this game a try. And I didn't regret my decision at all. The dialogues are perfect, again, its just as if you were watching the show! And probably what made me like this game, would also be the dark humor/comedy. But you're probably wondering why its not 5/5 instead, right? It's because I wanted more. :(\n\nReplayability (3/5) - You have probably seen my hours played on this game... But anyway, I gave it a 3/5 because it isn't really necessary, only a few lines would be changed upon choosing other options passages throughout the game. If you're an achievement hunter, you'll be replaying this quite a few times. So you better back up those saves, because there's no point of return or replay other than the save that you have.\n\nConclusion (4.5/5) - I totally recommend this game to anyone, whether you're a fan or not. Who knows? You might become one after playing this game. P.S. I've watched it from Season 1 to Season 17, can't wait for the next one! \m/\n\nNOTE: I idled the game for quite too long, resulting the hours played now.

I am not kidding i have seen that last one multiple times.\n\nIf you are not a fan of South Park the TV show, do not and i repeate DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! You will have no idea why this game was made and who the characters are and what the items are that you find along the way. I have seen almost every South Park episode made, which is why i love this game so much. The comedy and lines are exactly the same as what would be said in the show, Cartman is still just as big of an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as always, and Kyle is still the smart ♥♥♥ know it all. This game did a lot of things right, but the biggest was the setting. They made the setting exactlyyyyy like what it would be if it were a real episode.\n\nThe next thing done right is the combat. It is just fun as hell, you dont get sick of it at any point and by the end of the game you are a baddass ♥♥♥♥ing everyone up. For some that may not seem like fun, butto me it is beacuse to me the learnign curve at the beginning of the game makes you wish you were a bad ♥♥♥.\\n\nNext the story, to me the story is a lot of fun. Not perfecty, but absolutely enjoyable every moment. What i love the most is the games story is like a long episode of South Park itslef. Like everything done is exactly the same as what would be done in an episode.\n\nBut this game is not perfect, to me i wish there were more side missions, by level 6 or so i had already beaten every side mission, which was sad. Also i wish the level cap was higher than 15, maybe more around 20 would have been better in my opinion. Last the story is a little on the shorter side. Around 8 hours for most probably, which isnt bad, but i think 15 hours would have made the story perfect.\n\nWith that all being said this game is still amazing and well worth the money IF YOU ARE A SOUTH PARK FAN.

There's so many references that even the most diehard fans will miss a few.\n\nWhat makes this game really amazing is that not only is the South Park lore respected so completely, it's that it's actually fun. The story pulls you in, and that's something I didn't expect. The RPG mechanics are solid - combat is never a bore or a chore, and it's pretty amazing to shove a kindergartner up your ♥♥♥ as Mr. Slave.\n\nHow many other games can you say that it's fun to shove a kindergartner up your ♥♥♥? That's what I thought. That's what makes this game unique, it's offensive and doesn't care. It's brash, and true to itself, and for that, I have to say I'm having a ton of fun. Some people have complained about the length only being 20 hours for the 60 dollar price tag, and I can only tell you that you're well-off ignoring them.

What happens when you take the brilliance of Parker and Stone and pair it with the masterful skill of Obsidian Entertainment? This game.\n\nThis is an RPG that features a more old school style combat system, where timing is as important as upgrades and buffs. Speaking of RPG, it in itself is simple and yet maximizes what it intended to accomplish, and your guy will be a bad ### by the end of the game. Speaking of your guy, if you DON'T name him "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥", you aren't doing things properly, lol\n\nAnyway, playing through this game is basically like playing through an entire season of the TV show itself, with all the twists and turns a season might take. The town of South Park and all its inhabitants show up and are presented perfectly. The plot itself is also fairly well perfect, and I dare say that even if you aren't a fan of the show, you will still love this game.\n\nFor me, this was easily a 10 out of 10. Cant recommend this one highly enough really.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this game has a ton of replay value, not only for all the copious Easter Eggs, but also because the second playthrough will allow you choices that perhaps weren't available the first time around, and will also allow you to take different paths in the game as well (story choices, interactions, etc...) that have different consequences.","March 5, 2015","true","17.9"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","26","31","5","5"

It looks and feels just like the cartoon it's based on. It has all the crude humour and maybe even more.\n\nYou play as "the new guy". But you meet and group up with some of the familiar South Park kids like Cartman, Kenny and Butters etc. You can choose from 4 different classes, Fighter, Mage, Thief and Jew.\n\nIf you are a fan of the show, this game is a must have. You might not get all the jokes if you haven't watched the show at all. However, even for people who aren't big fans of the show it's still a good game with some really neat ideas. For example using enviroment to take out enemies before the actual fight starts. There's also plenty of customization for weapons and armor or just your looks.\n\nThe game is quite easy, so I suggest people to play difficulty set on hard.\n\n[Score: 85]","March 14, 2015","true","15.1"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","20","22","2","1"

This is just one small over the top humor and craziness found in South Park. If you watch or have ever seen the show you know this is typical SP humor.\n\nIn South Park you play as the silent new kid who just moved into town and are told to go outside and make friends. You meet Cartman, Butters, Princess Kenny, and a few others who are LARPing (Live Action Role-Playing) and playing as the humans. They ask you to join and help protect the Stick of Truth because whoever controls it can control the Universe.\n\nYou start out fighting against the elves who are played by Stan, Kyle, and some other kids. Things just get even crazier though as you go onto fight aliens, bums, and Nazi zombies. Majority of the story takes place in South Park but will also see Canada and a spaceship along the way. The story is funny and enjoyable to go through. Especially if you love the South Park show.\n\nThe game is a turn based RPG where you control a party of two but the option to switch one character with others who join you. When you pick your attack you try to hit the button at the right moment to get a perfect hit which can add a boost to the attack. Each character has one main weapon, melee or projectile, and magic attack except your character may do both melee and projectile. You can also do gaseous attacks which can explode or cause people to be grossed out.\n\nThroughout the game when you meet new people they will send you friend requests just like Facebook. After you become friends you will start seeing posts on your “Facebook” profile from them. These can be very funny and sometimes creepy. You also have many collectibles to find in the game like all the weapons and outfits. You can also try to locate all the Chinpokomon, which are SP’s parody of Pokémon in case you didn’t know. Hence the name.\n\nMy only gripe with the game was it felt short and I would have loved many more hilarious side missions. Maybe we could get lucky and see some DLC or maybe even a sequel if it sells enough. The game was a blast to play and had a great story that had me laughing many times. If you enjoy South Park and are looking for some really good laughs or even disturbing images, some of these I can never forget, than this is the game for you to play.\n\nBear Rating 9.5/10","April 11, 2014","true","19.0"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","0"

A game made by one of my favorite developers, Obsidian, working on a South Park game. Which has been a television show that hasn't really had a good game up until this one.\n\nThe things Stick of Truth does that impress me the most are that it works as both an adaptation of South Park and as a game in it's own right. There was clearly a huge focus on authenticity, down to how the aesthetic near flawlessly mimics that of the show. It's clear Matt and Trey had a very noticeable hand in the game's development. All of the humor is spot-on with that of the television show. Where they not only try to satirize common video game cliches, but also take advantage of them to make a very competantly made rpg.\n\nWhen I said it worked as a game as well I wasn't lying. The game is a turn based rpg, and this was an extremely smart decision on Obsidian's part. Because of the turn based nature to the combat you can have humerous moments like Al Gore putting your cleric to sleep with a powerpoint presentation. They also have small real-time elements where you press a button to block and attack at certain moments. It all works so well and it's phenominal to see such an attention to detail in a licensed game.\n\nI'm extremely glad the game lived up to it's hype. There are very few flaws worth mentioning with Stick of Truth beyond maybe the lack of replayability. But it really is a game that appeals to fans of the television show and people who want a turn based RPG that succeeds in making you laugh.","June 22, 2015","true","5.4"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liberteer/recommended/213670/","liberteer","Fißtechead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liberteer/","503 products in account","South Park came a long way since its humble beginnings - from crappy (pun intended) toilet humor to razor-sharp criticism of today's society, all the way to acid induced nonsense, it was crappy animated middle finger of TOTAL FUN.\n\nLast South Park game that I remember playing (beside South Park tables for Pinball FX2) was the one on Playstation One. It was FPS that I truly loved.\n\nIn 2014, South Park came back with the bang... and The Stick of Truth right up our asses.\n\nSouth Park: The Stick of Truth is basically simpler Skyrim meeting The Lord of The Rings in at least 10 hours long episode of South Park. You're the New Kid and you've just arrived to South Park where you've moved with your parents. Turns out idyllic mountain town is not that idyllic at all because soon enough you end up in the middle of fantasy war between Humans and Elves. Humans, led by one and only grand wizard Eric Cartman are trying to save The Stick of Truth and take it way from fiendish elves led by Kyle. But the new dangers loom...\n\nThe brilliance of this game is the fact Trey Parker and Matt Stone were leading a team in completely successful experiment of recreating classic South Park episode and making it interactive. Obsidian Entertainment used all the well known elements and characters of numerous South Park episodes spanning all the way back to Season 1. I have to admit I was a bit skeptic about how will this mash up turn out, but it passed with flying marks. Music, graphics and sounds are also 100% faithful to the TV show. Crude humor and politically insensitive remarks (try creating a Jew class or black character and see what happens) are still top notch, so the easiest thing to be said here is: if you're getting insulted by South Park TV show, you might back away and never look this way again.\n\nAs for the game mechanics, from the intro videos until the last game credits, it's easy to recognize parody. The menu shines The Skyrim way, and the RPG system is surprisingly simple, yet effective. This is a prime example of good game balance, where all the elements are put together to satisfy RPG fans, but never disturb people who just want to interact and watch this episode. Moving the difficulty slider really makes you choose how you want to play your game. It would be correct to state that roleplaying elements are serving the South Park story in all the right ways. Turn-based combat lets you pick items, plan your attacks, interact with your allies. Special moves often implement ridiculous mini-game strategies such as mashing buttons when Jimmy stutters to pump up your abilities. The game is choke full of details, little stuff that will make you laugh HARD.\n\nThe thing I need to point out as fantastic are controls. I've started playing this game using a controller and switched to keyboard and mouse. The transition was easy-peasy. Controls are seriously well-made.\n\nSouth Park: The Stick of Truth delivers. It delivers humor, attitude, playability and fun. It surely is one of the best games  I've played in my life (and believe me, I've played a lot), and surprisingly good, but simplistic RPG as well. Actually, since Max Payne 3 it was the first game that never had a dull moment and I didn't want it to end.\n\n***\n\nHey, you've liked this review? Hated it?

There is a lot of customization available within the game, though you can only play as a young boy.\n\nThe game takes you through various locations familiar in South Park as you can explore the town. You also meet many of the familiar characters from the series throughout the game. They do a great job of making you feel like you are playing through an episode of the show and manage to find ways of ribbing just about every group out there, the same way the show does. I think if you are a fan of the show, you should give this game a try. The game is prefaced by a trilogy of episodes known as the "Black Friday Trilogy", including; Black Friday, A Song of ♥♥♥ and Fire, as well as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and Dragons, all of which lead up to the timeline of the game. I recommend watching these episodes prior to playing the game so you have some context for the storyline.","December 10, 2015","true","21.0"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PunasaurusRex/recommended/213670/","PunasaurusRex","PunasaurusRex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PunasaurusRex/","5687 products in account","Let me start off by saying the following. This review is biased. I have been a fan of the show since I was little. (as it was against my parents rules to watch this show - so what does  kid do when he's told not to do something - he does it). I own multiple season of the show on dvd. And probably have seen every episode 5+ times (except episode 200 and 201, which I have only seen when it aired live).\n\nStory:\nI think the story to the game is marvelous. It brings characters you have seen throughout the show in the game (since they are part of the universe) and integrates each one of them into the story. Initially, the premise of role playing being brought back from Season 6 episode 13 - The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers. A continuation of our four favorite 4th graders and their adventures with magic, swordplay, archery, and of course flatulence.\n\nIn turn, it introduces the new kid (you) into the story as you learn of the interactions between Cartman, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and of course the 5th wing - Butters. You make your way completing tasks as part of the human faction to raise and protect the stick of truth. Leads to a decisive will you side with Cartman or Kyle. The story then takes a turn for the worse when aliens are involved, green goo, Taco Bell. and of course The Government. As you work your way to finding the secret behind whats going on in South Park you find new powers and new facebook friends. Culminating all your work in a final battle for the Stick of Truth. (trying my best not to ruin this)\n\nI think the story did a good job integrating the characters, you, and like normal South Park's tendency to comment on society (in this case gaming society). The writing is that what you expect when Matt and Trey are involved in their characters game. And is an overall is great for avid fans and those who like the show but only watch when its on.\n\nGameplay/Controls:\nI thought the turn based system worked well. "Just like in Medieval Times". I only had one issue with the controller and that was during the abortion jobs. However reverting to keyboard/mouse quickly corrected this and let me get past. Besides this I had no issues getting around south park, aiming my arrows and farts. Battles were pretty straight forward. Attack, do the button sequence suggested. You can use one item per character turn - straightforward. Sometimes finding items were sometimes difficult but if you explore anything can be found. On my first play through - I was able to find all friends, all costumes, and all weapons.\n\nReplayability.\nThere are 4 different classes. Each play a little different. My first playthrough I played as fighter. I am currently replaying the game as a Jew. For me, I think this game can easily be replayed - choose a different class - choose different outfits, abilities, weapons to use.\n\nLanguage/Humor:\nIf you can't stand foul language, toilet humor, references to fetus, abortions, nazis, zombies, germans, bobbling head Canadians. This is not a game for you.\nLet's just say if u remember the movie - Cartman's last ability to defeat Saddam Hussein...is one of his main abilities. So if you can not stand hearing that type of language this game is not for you.\n\nOverall:\nThis game is marvelous. Average play is about 14-15 hours. And the game runs like a 15 hour episode of South Park. There are an abundance of references: Mr Slave's ♥♥♥. Stupid Spoiled ♥♥♥♥♥ clothing, Christmas Critters, Anime Princess Kenny. I spent a good time just looking at billboards and closets seeing how many episodes I could point out from the items you see.\n\n\nShort Version:\nSouth Park show Great. Matt and Trey writing - Great\nSouth Park Game + Matt and Trey writing/involvement = Stick of Truth = Amazing Game.\n\nThis is a must play.\n","March 8, 2014","true","31.5"," 25 of 36 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","25","36","0","1"

This game oozes genius and brilliance from the first seconds to the very last minute of the story. The delivery, perfect; the content, hilarious; gameplay? Repayable, exciting, fresh and surprisingly disgusting! Even by south park standards, creators Trey Parker & Matt Stone have raised the bar (much like James Cameron – “The bravest pioneer”) with revolting humour, storytelling and integration of their hugely rich universe they’ve created over the last 17 years. The Stick of Truth is not only the best south park game created, but the best game adaptation of cartoon or TV series as matter of fact, and that really says great things about the future of south park digital studios and Obsidian entertainment.\n\nThis game is a steal at the price and I whole fully endorse it through and through, not only as massive fan of the show but as a gamer with more than 2 decades of consistent gaming under my belt and a love for RPG’s in particular.\nIgnore the criticism of the games ease and repetitiveness, both are integral to how the game is not only played but lived. There’s a good 15hours of main story without side quests and exploring, not to mention there will be some much welcome DLC on the way by the tell of the current map that will be every bit as grand as the release itself. I could bore you forever with reasons for why you should own this game and whip you endlessly for reasons as to why you have not already, the point is, if you are browising this game, you should own it and the creators and publishers are deserving of every damn, penny, cent, rupee, euro yaddadadad you get the point.... BUY IT!\n\nBravo, Obsidian and Bravo, South Park Studios, the wait was worth it and the game, perfect.\n","March 25, 2014","true","76.8"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","3"

This! How many problems has this game been involved in? After THQ went under (so sad...loved them...), the future for South Park was unclear in the video game industry and we secretly wanted a GOOD South Park game...\n\nBut then Ubisoft bought the license and the game for some weird reason got delayed YET AGAIN, but then it was actually coming and leaving development hell! It's here and we all know games from development hell never receive good criticism across the board (Duke Nukem Forever, Colonial Marines, can't think of anything else atm so, sorry).\n\nSouth Park, however...shows that development hell does not mean 100% certain game franchise death. It's brilliant! (almost, actually...)\n\nWell, the sound design + writing are the things that sell it the most. I mean, it's South Park! We all wanted to see how far Trey and Matt would go with the game! The show has always been an excellent and funny (though disgusting most of the times, lol) piece of social criticism, that surprisingly has gotten under me and opened my eyes on some stuff...but never without some laughs...\nThe game succeeds at that with the great writing, the excellent voice writing and the overall feel of the game. It feels like a 15 hour long South Park episode, and a good one at that!\nFirst of all! It's an RPG, so is there character creation? Yes. Is it deep? No. Could it be deeper? Oh hell yes!\nYou pick a race, face and hair. That's it... No initial atributes or such... you start off as a new kid in the lovely and quirky town of South Park. You have a face, hair, glasses or not, and finally, a shirt and pants + shoes. The first 30 minutes are linear, because they will get you to the KKK club (because why not?) where you meet the humans guarding the Stick of Truth (which is a stick...) and protect it from the elves who want it and with it, control the universe...\n\nThe humans and elves and this overall story is a GIGANTIC larp/dress-up play... and it work on setting the vibe. At the KKK at first, you will put your name, and you are sent on an assignment to recover the Stick, because it got stolen (don't worry, these ain't spoilers, just the basic premise: basically, the first 30 minutes of the game) during an early game fight.\n\nIn the fight, you will be introduced to the wonderful combat system: it's turn based! Alas Paper Mario (which I never played) and it reminds me a lot of Super Mario: SuperStar Saga (which I played to death! You should play it for the GameBoy Advance, it's an excellent Mario game: Open World RPG with tactical turn-based combat, amazing story and combat and exploration and main and side quests and stuff... Buy it! Pliszz!)\nThe combat will give you this impression that it is deep with these buffs, de-buffs, huge amounts of consumables and quirky weird weapons...\n\nBut, it's far from deep and has 1 major flaw which I will adress later. The game is deep at first. But once you get into like the 3rd or 4th or even 5th hour of the game (if you really explore everything, which I did), you will gain abilities and passives... these will overpower you so f*cking much! You have no idea! At the middles of the game I got one where if I killed someone or dealt a long-term damage (like bleeding or other stackable nerfs to the enemy), I would regain MORE PP (Power Points, which you consume to use your special attacks) than the PP that you actually SPENT ON THE ABILITY! I could just spam abilities every single turn without worrying about the using consumables, and trust me, 70% of consumables I didn't even touch! They just stacked there in the inventory (you can carry everything you want, there is no such thing as overencumbering like in Fallout or Skyrim which is good imo for this game in particular).\nThe flaw I mentioned above: It seems like the QA team never actually got into this, (it's something that happens rarely, but it can totally screw you over in the rare times it happens!) but, I got a very few number of times this:\n\n-1 enemy left, he starts a riposte stance (which you can't melee, because you will be the one to take damage, not him).\n-I got stunned, couldn't do ♥♥♥♥...\n-Side character: Butters! (Melee focused!). I had spent a consumable so I couldn't use a revival or another consumable. I had no PP to do a special attack or anything...\nSo! I attacked, and he riposted, I took damage, and then everything went back to normal...\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nYes, NO END TURN BUTTON! This made me damage my character due to no more options on what to do! This doesn't matter much, but imagine the same situation, but you are dead (not stunned) and Butters had 1 HP...\n\nYou would lose... great!\n\nIt's just not well thought out, you see?\n\nAnyways, dont think I dislike the combat... I actually love it! It's fun enough to make me want to keep on going and see what weapons and specials and new enemies I will face (enemy variety is HUGE btw)...\n\nWith combat aside... graphics look exactly like the show (which is great), and the game runs on a 30 FPS lock which is FINE! Because with the graphical style of the show, it has to run at 30 FPS. This is probably the only forgivable 30 FPS locked PC game in history, so there you go...\nSound design is solid (this next sentence, I'm going to repeat myself, but the voice acting and story deserve double praise, so... there you go), voice acting is amazing, possibly (possibly!) best of the year so far. Writing is excellent, it's South Park so, it's disgusting...ly funny. The story is solid, the twists and turns it takes are cool and make you want to keep going.\nThe open world is great, it's the first time we get to see the actual map layout of the South Park, which is super cool. Every place has a story or quest of it's own (there is one where a priest tells you to "Find Jesus", another, you will have to kill a mouse with a ♥♥♥♥♥ attached to his back in a mutated process (it's a thing from the show)).\nIt's great and rewarding to explore, every quest is fun and unique to do, not just a "collect 10 of this"!\nThe game's length deserves some discussing though: It took me 15 hours to beat it, with exploration, side quest solving and other activities that can be done. It's a good value for me, especially since I get bored of RPG's at about 10 hours (unless it's Fallout or something really exceptional). But for 40€? Heh... not really. I'm writing this review during the summer sale, and I remember it was 27 euros on a daily deal, (which is what? like 35-40 dollars, around that, I think...) which then is worth it completely. Anything around that 25 euro/35 dollar price tag is worth it; though it's sad there is NO New game +. There should be New Game + is games like this! Always!\n\nNo multiplayer as well, which is good. Screw Multiplayer, we don't need that stuff! What we want is good writing, awesome story, tons, tons and tons and TONS of references to the TV show, good, fluid and fun combat, great and fun world to explore and just overall: we want a good f*cking time!\n\nAnd they gave us ALL of that, and the game is mostly perfect, there isn't much to complain, at all.\n\nMy pointless and stupidly abstract score for this game is a 9/10... get it under 30 euros or 40 dollars and you should be good with your purchase.\n\nNever fart of someone's balls...","June 29, 2014","true","17.6"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","19","27","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/recommended/213670/","JiveSoulBro","Jive Soul Bro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/","85 products in account","At its core, South Park: The Stick of Truth is a casual, story-driven RPG. More so than any other modern RPG, this game is driven on writing rather than any gameplay mechanics. And since this is South Park we're talking about, the writing consists of much shock humor and repeated WTF moments. In fact, I've come to accept that the game is so defined by its writing that any attempt at gameplay analysis is ultimately moot.\n\nEarly on in my first playthrough, I thought I had discovered the optimal configuration of weapons, equipment and patches that would allow me to break the game wide open. Then I realized this was NOT Final Fantasy and such efforts were ultimately in vain. This is not a challenging game, even at Hardcore difficulty. The greatest mistake I made was searching the internet for that twelfth Timmy express flag and learning more than I wanted about the story. Whenever you read ahead, you lose the most important thing this game has to offer.\n\nThere is little point in guides and walkthroughs in the first place. I suspect that Obsidian made it easy for you specifically so you don't feel the compulsion to search out secrets on the internet in the first place. On a second playthrough and for achievement purposes, sure! But it's not entirely inaccurate to call South Park: The Stick of Truth an extended interactive episode of South Park where you are the hero. Except that it prompts the question: who pays 40 bucks for an interactive movie? This is strictly a Steam Sale purchase; put it on your wishlist, avoid all spoilers and wait.\n\nSo, is it funny? Well YMMV but on the whole I'd pretty much say yes. You don't have to be a South Park aficionado to appreciate the game and this is coming from someone who hates the politics of the series. The in-jokes are mostly relegated to the articles of vendor trash you pick up across your journey and without giving anything away, the humor mostly comes from trope lampshading, many instances of WTF, a dedicated fart button and boss fight music.\n\nI really, really wish you could do more with the combat system. There's a majority of enemy encounters that can be eliminated through clever interaction with the environment... but that just feels like cheating yourself out of more gaming content! You never have more than one party member at a time and can't even modify their stats/equipment, making for an extremely single character-centric RPG. Some people might have no patience for party management but this game is lacking in substance already, so any opportunity for customization would be welcome.\n\nI'd still recommend purchasing this game (20 bucks seems like a fair price) and experiencing it for yourself rather than following a Let's Play. There's plenty to discover in your small secluded mountain town and it's obvious that the developers spent a lot of time stuffing the whole place with secrets. South Park's distinctive "cutout" animation style and bright colors lends well to RPGs, making it easy to pick out which object you can interact with and the radial battle menu makes for clean, intuitive battles. Shallow as it is, South Park: The Stick of Truth makes for an accessible RPG.\n\nJust don't do like I did and buy the DLC. It's all level 2 equipment which you quickly outgrow into irrelevance. Speaking of which, I think it's relevant to say that the "treasure location" panel on the world map is bugged, just so you don't go wasting 20 minutes searching for nonexistent items. Apart from all that, you're fine.","January 15, 2015","true","43.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

Immediately you become a friend of Butters and he gets you into the Human clan of a Dungeon & Dragons-esque group ruled by the Grand Wizard Cartman. You are given the choice between four character classes. You can be a Fighter, a Mage, a Thief, or a Jew.\nAt the first part of South Park: The Stick of Truth you spend your time recruiting factions and battling elves to reclaim the stick. In true South Park fashion the story escalates out of control leading to being abducted by aliens, shrank by underpants gnomes and travelling to 8-bit Canada to translate abortion documents written in French. The story makes sense in the context of South Park and it was genuinely a lot of fun to play through.\nBetween collecting Chinpokomon, completing all the side quests and levelling up this game will take up close to 20 hours to complete.\nThe game looks exactly like the show.\nThe voice acting is very good, all known voices from the television show are there. The music is also very good. Besides of epic middle-earth music playing in the town, you can listen to songs from the television show in stores.\nOverall South Park: The Stick of Truth is absolutely epic! It literally feels like the show. If you are a fan of South Park you will love it.\n\nSounds 10/10\nGraphics 10/10\nGameplay 9/10\nAtmosphere 10/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","March 26, 2015","true","32.4"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","12","15","6","0"

How could I be so wrong!\n\nGraphics\nThere is really no graphic option in game but I do not really think they are necessary since south park has a certain look to it and you do not really need AA, FOV or depth of field. I would love the support for triple monitors though.\n\nCharacter classes\nFighter, Mage, Thief or Jew\n\nStory (Spoiler free)\nThere is two factions Kingdom kupa keep and the elves they are fighting for the stick of truth which gives the bearer control of the universe with everything you would expect from south park included.\n\nImpressions after playing the game\nThis game is not your typical turn based rpg this has south park written all over it you can really see that Matt Stone and Trey Parker played a huge part in making this game it felt like I was playing a whole season of South park and I did not want it to end. The further I got in to the game the story got more and more crazy it was totally what I would expect from a South park episode and they delivered it flawlessly. As soon as I completed the game I wanted to experience it all again.","March 14, 2014","true","15.8"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","2"

The game looks exactly like the game. Everything in the game is southpark related from the collectables to clothing. You will find things in this game that will surprise you in a never ending laughter. I have to admit i lost a few battles by laughing.\n\nThe game is an RPG that took some aspects from different games. Final Fantasy and Skyrim are two i can name off my head. They're not exactly related to it but it has some references in the game that make you believe that. Now before you go off saying i don't like turn based RPG games... This game is actually a bit more interactive than your typical FInal Fantasy game.\n\nYou play as the new kid and you get to design your character anyway you want.

It is (although I don't know why) amazing how much the game looks like an episode of the show. I laughed out loud serveral times, and was super grossed out several times as well. The fighting system, leveling system and perk system are all well done and fairly interesting. Weapons can have patches which put additional damage or bonuses on them. The fighting system is turn based. Perks are achieved both through leveling up and obtaining friends on social media.\n\nIt seems like this is a personal problem and not a problem of the game because it happens to me a lot but around hour 17, I really wanted to be done. The last bits have some of the grossesst/funniest parts so I was glad I ploughed through it but I am certainly finding that I am a fan of experiences that are in the 10-15 hour range.\n\nI'm a fan of Southpark from the first couple of years but haven't watched it in several. It was still a great visit back to Southpark, Cartman, Kenny, Kyle and crew are still funny and it was great to revisit them. My only "warning" would be that this is not censored in any way shape or form.

Sadly I was always put off by the full price of £40. I waited until this years Summer sale and picked it up for £20 and was not disappointed.\n\nThe game takes the style of a turn based combat title, much like Final Fantasy, but it is a much more mellowed down version. I was able to breeze through most combat situations without much attention being paid. The parts of the game which got me scratching my head were trying to work out how to proceed through each puzzle, often at times I had to refer to a walkthrough as I was starting to get a brain hemorrhage.\n\nThe graphics and sound throughout the game are exactly the same as in the TV series, so if you enjoy that, you will certainly feel at home here. The ever so crass South Park esk jokes and one liners are here for the world to marvel at.\n\nStory wise, again, very much a South Park episode, you will almost feel like you are watching the show while playing. The length of the main story is about ten hours long, some may disagree but I think that is a little short for a game at full price of £40, but there are plenty of side missions and achievements to go hunting for if that is your thing.\n\nIf you are lucky enough to find this game on sale for anything under £20. I would certainly recommend you give it a try if you have ever enjoyed the TV show, however you may not fully appreciate it. Certainly is not worth full price. But for the price I have paid, I still really enjoyed my playthrough.\n","July 19, 2014","true","13.5"," 33 of 57 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","33","57","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlexChew_/recommended/213670/","AlexChew_","Alex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlexChew_/","82 products in account","I've played all the South Park games, and honestly I wasn't going to give this a try. But I said What The Heck and bought it for 40$. This game is really good. The story is fantastic, the humor is great, the gameplay is amazing, and I just love it all.\n\nFirst, the story. Talks about the Evles VS Humans. Cartman is leader of the Humans, Kyle is the leader of the Elves. They are in a constant war for the "Stick of Truth" because "For whoever controls the stick, controls the universe" Keep in mind that it is not real violence, and they're actually hitting each other with sticks, it's all imagination. It is made to look like real violence, but it really isn't.\n\nSecond, the humor. I love the script of this game. Cartman has probably the best lines. It's just amazing how they got the humor so perfect. South Park fans will love this part.\n\nThird, Gameplay. It's a normal RPG with a few tweaks. First of all, enemies aren't random, and you can avoid most of them, except bosses. One of my favorite parts is that your PP (Power Points) and HP (Health Points) regain by themselves when you finish the battle. That way you don't waste your items. There are certain abilities you can have depending on your class, Jew, Fighter, Mage, or Theif. Each of these abilities are unique in their own way. For example, Theif has a backstab, and Fighter has a move where you kick someone in the balls. You can also get Fart Magic, which is honestly the funniest battle mechanic ever. You unlock the abilities the more you level up, and can level up each ability up to a certain level (4 or 5 I believe). There's also tons of sidequests. This is probably one of my favorite RPG's ever.\n\nFourth, Customization. There are tons of customization options. Througout the game you can get wigs, facial features, and even clothes you can wear the make you stronger. Sadly you cannot be a girl, but you can make yourself look like one. You can modify your weapons and clothes to have certain colors or abilities. Things called "Perks" are unlocked by having friends in South Park. The more friends, the more perks. These perks make you stronger or weaker. You can modify your weapons and clothes by adding little patches that have certain abilities, like 20% more money, or Gross Damage, or even Bleeding. Tons of option here, you wont get upset by that.\n\nThings I don't like about the game: First, it's really freaking short. It's not worth the 60$ it used to be, so they dropped it to 40. I reccomend waiting for a sale at like, 35 or even 30. Now the Saving feature in this game is absolute bullcrap. When you save it might save a little bit before where you actually were, making you have to do a battle or 2 again. Another thing I don't like is how the difficulty suddenly raises halfway through the game. Then again you can customize the difficulty to your taste at any time.\n\nThis game really is good, but it does have some faults. Also, you can fart on people, highly recommended if you're into this humor and gametype. I'd say wait till it's on sale though, not worth the 40$ in my opinion.","October 6, 2014","true","28.1"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

It's like being a part of one big episode of South Park, but one that is entirely uncensored and no holds barred.  It's even better if you're a real fan of the show and understand the references in the game.\n\nLots of crude humor.  I find myself grinning the entire time I play because of all the little funny things I find in game.  Heed the ESRB rating.  There are certain scenarios in the game that are pretty graphic.\n\nIt's a no stress game.  Lots of fun to play through.  I'm not exactly sure of the replay value.  I know there are other classes to try, and--as I am a completionist--I want to try to get all the collectables and aim for all the achievements.

This is pretty much the ultimate South Park experience, and it's been perfectly executed in every fathomable way. The gameplay is easy to pick up, it's funny, and it doesn't bore you when nothing is happening in the story. The story itself, however, is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious. Not only that, it's deep and very immersive, which was kind of a nice surprise for a South Park game of all things. I've also enjoyed the game very much, finding all the easter eggs and references is a pretty fun thing to do while you're taking a break from story missions. There's also a ton of side-missions, so you won't be completely done story-wise after the main story is completed, there's plenty more to do.\n\nIn regards to other gameplay elements and characters, Timmy is the best fast-travel system I've ever used. You have a few companions (or buddies as they're called in-game) to help you on your journey, as well as in every fight. Some of the ones early on are characters like Butters, Kenny, Jimmy, etc. It's great. And if I'm not mistaken, nearly every character in South Park is in this, even the one's that aren't most likely have at least one reference to them.\n\nYou can clearly tell the devs cared about this game. I'm very satisfied with it, and I'm sure any other fans will be too. Even newcomers to South Park in general can enjoy it.\n\nSo, finally, yes, I recommend the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game, it's an easy 10/10 for me.","March 14, 2014","true","13.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jedo/recommended/213670/","jedo","Black Mage Jedo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jedo/","3564 products in account","This game was quite good all the way until the end.\n\nI spent a total of 37 hours along 3 playthroughs in order to fully complete this game. I wanted this game at 100% but unfortunately I missed out on a lot of hidden stuff that blocked me from certain achievements. That in itself is a good thing because for a partly open-world game, this game requires a lot of attention to detail. Thankfully the game has some amazing replay value provided by the humour and variety (by switching out your class and regularly used buddy).\n\nHere's a few awesome things about the game:\n\n- Lots of humorous collectibles. The game has some awesome names for the Chinpokomon and the various outfits/weapons.\n- Tons of references to previous episodes. The battle quotes from Cartman are especially funny.\n- Battle System is simple. The battle mechanics are easy to understand and there's not a lot of 'grinding' involved. You can gain experience for using smart solutions to progress through the levels so technically you are rewarded for using the environment instead of just bull rushing through hordes of enemies.\n- Short and sweet. The game has just the right amount of content for a 10 hour session (a bit longer if you want 100%). Although I don't necessarily agree with the current price tag, I am at least satisfied with how genuinely 'South Park' this game is.\n\n\nHere are a few things I'd like to mention:\n\n- The map that shows you how many collectibles are left in an area is a bit bugged. A few people (as well as myself) have reported seeing indicators that equipment could still be found in an area that has completely been cleaned out.\n- You max out in levels long before you complete the game. If you want a more challenging final boss encounter, you can skip out on certain content to be 'underleveled'.\n- It would have been nice to gain access to certain levels once you beat the game. Some areas are completely locked off after you clear their related quests. This makes sense for areas that are eventually destroyed in the storyline though.\n\n9/10\nIt was a fun game!","March 7, 2014","true","38.0"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","18","29","0","2"

Instead, I'll say some of the same things everyone else already has. It's like actually playing a season of South Park with your custom character, and the combat employs action commands ala the various Super Mario RPG titles and Shadow Hearts.\n\nWhile some of the humor falls flat, and there's a certain thing repeated a few times early on, the vast majority succeeds in prompting laughter, which is more than I can say for most media which claims to be comedic nowadays. At the same time, it's brutally self-aware, not only of it's status as an RPG, but as a South Park videogame. The voicework and animation is spot on with the show, and, honestly, if you didn't know it was a game, you'd think it WAS an episode or movie.\n\nSpeaking of which, there's references to the movie along with the entirety of the show's 17+ year run, and yes, even music, which Matt & Trey are surprisingly talented at. The game's soundtrack takes on an absurdly epic style, with several of the main themes being very similar to that of "real" fantasy titles, like Skyrim, and with good reason. It also has a strong Earthbound vibe to it, because of the whole "kids using toys to inflict terrible damage to hostile and weird enemies" along the way.\n\nIt's not perfect; unless you turn the difficulty all the way up, you'll likely breeze through 90% of the battles, and it's very easy to hit the low level cap. There's also a number of game-breaking attack combos you can learn with every class, and debuffs are so powerful that they're practically mandatory. But it's all worth it. Despite these problems, I've spent nearly 100 hours in the game, as I went through multiple playthroughs, and didn't regret a minute of it. Well, except for those minutes with the repeated thing I won't mention early on, that is.\n\nOh, and no major spoilers, but I HAVE to share a minor one, which should tell you just what kind of game this is. The hardest boss, by far? Not the last one, or even the next-to-the-last one, both of whom can be tricky.

I was wary of this one for some time because usually licensor titles have huge flaws, but luckily this one's are minimal: The options are terrible, you can't rebind keys or do other basic functions you'd expect on a PC game. The whole feel is of a lame console port. The controls are a bit confusing since the console version relied on sticks, which keyboard/mouse users don't have. Some of the companions are embarrassingly weak, while Kyle is downright overpowered in almost all situations.\n\nBut with the bad out of the way, it's a pretty good game. Naturally it requires that you've seen a lot of South Park to know 90% of what's going on, but it has the feel of a playable South Park episode. It has a script written by Parker and Stone, it's filled with eye-buldging moments, eye hiding moments, and WTF moments that you'd expect from South Park.  Think of it as a DVD with lost episodes, only they're playable...and they kind of resemble the three-part episode they did around Black Friday 2013.\n\nBut don't expect a lot of replay value out of it.

It is also genuinely laugh out loud funny.\n\nThat’s basically all you need to know. The gameplay itself is basic. It’s barely an RPG: you don’t speak so there’s no dialog choices (or really any meaningful choices to be made) and everything from JRPG combat to equipment management is very simple. But really the game is a backdrop to the humour.\n\nThis is a South Park comedy taking advantage of the medium of gaming more than it is a game taking advantage of the setting of South Park. The story takes some of the best bits from the show and it does what is does very well. The presentation is basically flawless, it really does look and feel like South Park.\n\nYes there are jokes about farts and disability and ethnicity and abortions and... and you will try to pretend to feel guilty about laughing, but you won’t really because you’re having too much fun.\n","April 5, 2015","true","4.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This game has surprised me in a few ways.  First off, I tried watching South Park when I was younger, and wasn't a fan of it in the slightest, so I assumed I wouldn't like this game.  Well, first surprise, I ended up enjoying it quite a lot.  The second way it surprised me was that ALL of the adult, raunchy humor you see in the show made its way into the game.  When I say all of it, I mean all of it!  In fact, its rating of 'M' has every category that the show does, including nudity, sexual content, and drug references.  I wasn't expecting to see South Park's full blown adult content in a video game.  If you look at some of my screenshots, you will see what I mean by this.  I'm no prude by any means, but some of the stuff in this game is why I never cared for South Park.\n\nWhen you first start the game, you're given the option to create your own character.  You can choose skin color, hair color clothes, glasses, and one accessory.  While the customization is basic, it's very well done.  What really impressed me about this game was that during cut scenes I forgot I was playing a game.  It looks so much like the tv show, straight down to every animation, even the graphics style.  Wile on the topic of graphics, I never had issues with lag or FPS drops.  ST:TSoT is very well optimized, and runs good even on a laptop.\n\nMy biggest critique is with the combat system.  I realize this game is not intended to be some in depth combat game, but it could've been improved on.  Something I noticed frequently was that it didn't properly register when I blocked attacks.  I'd block them right on time, but it'd say I failed.  This seems to be a an issue within the game.  The combat system feels too much like Pokemon.  You attack, your oppnent attacks, use food or spell to revive, same thing over and over until someone's health is depleted.  I would've preferred if the combat system was a bit more unique.\n\nSP:TSoT utilized very minimal quick time events that are used in combat for attacking and blocking.  The quick time event is quick time.  You have a second or less to respond or you fail, and when they're trying to teach you how to do it, you have to do it right in order to advance.  Not everyone has quick reflexes and can react in under a second.  I can already see people getting stuck and frustrated because they have to click that very second.\n\nThis game has full controller compatibility, and that earns it a huge plus.  I find that games like this do better with controllers.  One issue I noticed was that once a controller is plugged in, the mouse and keyboard cease to work in the game.  I do not understand why it has to be one or the other, and why both can't work at the same time.\n\nPlot/Story wise, it reminded me of the old TV show Recess.  A bunch of kids just doing normal kid things that, to them, is serious/fun.  What I really enjoyed was that the entire story seemed to be based around kids roleplaying.  It wasn't anything real serious, just a relaxed, day-by-day of what these kids do.\n\nPositives:\nHad some very funny easter eggs and dialogue.\nStayed true to South Park's animation and feel.\nNice customization for character.\nRuns pretty well even on a laptop.\nController support.\nGood plot.Negatives:\nPoor combat system that didn't always register your reaction.\nGame forced you to choose between controller or keyboard,couldn't use both.\nAdult/sexual humor that went too far for a video game.\n\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's, and check out our Curators.","March 15","true","2.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","1"

Yet despite its crude nature, the game has a charming quality underneath all of it, the characters are funny and well written and the game does a great job of representing the south park universe. Going around the town, speaking to all the characters, finding lots of secrets as you unlock new abilities is  fun and really rewards the player with some valuable things.\n\n\nThe Average:\n\nThe RPG mechanics and combat can be pretty basic especially for veterans in the genre. Turn based combat is pretty simple; melee, range and abilities you can use depending on the class you picked. You can equip many different types of equipment that grant bonuses but I never felt they really made that big of a difference in the long run.\n\nThe game also happens to be very easy even on normal mode. Play this game on hard if you want some challenge.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nI'm sure if you are a fan of South Park you have already completed the game; if you are not a fan than you should still play this game if you want a light hearted RPG experience. If you are the type of person that is overly sensitive, you may want to avoid this game.\n","April 10","true","24.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

And now throw that thought away and play this. It’s even better."\nTL;DR:  ♥♥♥♥ you Al Gore. It’s worth buying it 2 times.\n\n\nNote: This review doesn’t contain any spoiler.\n\nGraphic 9/10 What can I say? It’s your typical South Park look. Even though some effects seem dull, you’ll get what you expect. Every little detail is beautiful designed and there are some surprises. But don’t expect any graphical wonders. I love it.\n\nSound 10/10 I wish I could give more than 10/10. Some Soundtracks are damn good and remind you of certain games like Skyrim and such. But even funnier and better. Perfect synchro as in the series. Some weapon could sound more…”Damaging”, but overall you’ll feel mighty and strong and it is all accompanied by gorgeous music.\n\nStory: 9/10 Normally I’d give here a 7/10, since the Story isn’t THAT innovative, but since it’s South Park, they managed to do fantastic things out of seemingly tedious things. It’s all well told and it doesn’t get boring at all. For me it was.. or is.. THE best South Park Episode I’ve experienced so far. And it gets weirder the further you get.\n\nGameplay: 8/10 Oh boy where do I start? I’ll quote Smash Mouth here: “So much to do, so much to see.” And that’s on point. You have so many items to gather and equip, so many different enemy types to fight, so many places to visit… I could go on forever. I spent the first hour just walking through the whole town and visiting every building, talking to everyone. It was great.\nThe Fights are well done and you have a lot of ways to handle them. May it be through magical farts or combining your abilities with some heavy sword attacks. You even get to set who is accompanying you. You can choose wether it is Butters, Kyle, Cartman etc.. They all have different abilities and offering advantages in certain fights. So try them all out!\nThe options seem endless. The only thing I really didn’t like about it is that later on it gets so annoying to fight since it gets way too easy (I recommend a higher difficulty level). But you are greatly entertained for some hours.\n\nDifficulty: 4/10 The first half of the game was really challenging and some quest I had to leave out and do them later since I didn’t had a chance, but around Level 9 it starts getting way too easy. I played on normal (You can switch difficulty settings mid-game if you want) and I smashed just through the enemy lines. It’s easy for beginners, but don’t expect that much of a challenge. ♥♥♥♥ you Al Gore.\n\n\nNotable: - I haven't come along one single bug. Just One or two minor lags that aren’t even worth mentioning.\n- Funniest Game ever.\n- ♥♥♥♥ you Al Gore.\n- Lack of options, which is also not really worth mentioning because.. come on.. You didn’t really expect changing the graphic settings here, did you?\n- Runs smoothly\n- I completed it in around 16 hours and that is quite a lot! I left out 2 quests, which you can still complete after beating the game, but I was satisfied and happy at the end.\n-  The End is perfect.\n\nConclusion: If you’re a fan of South Park: Get it.\nIf you’re no fan of South Park: Get it and become a fan.\n\nThanks for reading, if there are any questions leave a comment below.","June 27, 2015","true","16.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","6","7","3","0"

Nearly everything from past episodes is referenced somewhere in the world, and the attention to detail goes above and beyond what I'd expect a game. Specific characters who you can completely avoid might make a joke if you do something specific, like farting or changing to a buddy (like swapping to Butters when you're in Professor Chaos' lair). The attention to detail on such small things is not something you see in many games. It feels just like an episode of South Park, comedic pacing and all.\n\nI had a few problems with the game. The shop system was probably made for a gamepad, since selling things takes too long. You'll find items which only exist to be sold, and you get them in bulk. You have to double click each and every single one, or if it's in a stack, select the item, then left click "sell stack". It's not horrible but it takes longer than it needs to. The more important problem is that the game is just too damn easy. At the 10 hour mark I put the game on hardcore difficulty (which I never do because I'm a filthy casual), and I still ended up destroying every boss in 3-6 turns, minus the final boss which was only slightly longer, but by no means difficult. Also my character kept cutting out during the pre-final boss cutscene, which kind of took me out of the experience.\n\nRegardless it's still one of the best JRPGs I've ever played, and it's totally worth your time and money.\n\nFive out of five Lennys\n( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °)","January 25, 2015","true","16.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Both blatantly and cleverly they have many references to the shows past storylines as well as awesome new content to be had.\n\nThe story has been a blast so far and the mechanics for battles are loads of fun. A turn based RPG with some control over the action is actually pretty damn sweet. (think paper mario)\n\nI can highly suggest this to anyone looking for a light RPG game with tons of collectables and fun combat. As well to anyone that loves South Park.\n\nDisclaimer:\nFor those that are offended easily the satire is ripe and raunchy while remaining smart and funny. They hold absolutely no punches in the Uncensored version. I can see it being absolutely devastating to anyone that is faint of heart. It gets pretty rude and crazy. I may be a monster, because while some stuff was wicked gross, I still laughed and never felt offended.\n\nUPDATE:\nI completed the game and stand by the statements I made originally, this game is fantastic and a total blast to play through. Nothing ever becomes overly tired like most RPGs, and it is hilarious through and through. Highly Recommend.

Its brutal-honest, rude, sexist, racism and overall butt-jokes all over. I gotta say I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at first because of the stupid region lock and censor version I get in germany but BOY....I sure as hell wouldnt let MY kid play this game.....no sir......not for the nazi signs but the overall expressions and topic of the game isnt for minors.\n\nOkay so its South park all right. We love it and theres enough to laugh about. How does it fare regarding RPG mechanics?\n\nSurprisingly its a solid even tho old-school system in place. The items and powers are good for a chuckle and give enough complexity to keep you min-maxing as it "should" be. Whats new are the mini-games tied to combat attacks and moves. Its more then just buttom smashing and requires timing and overall awarness. I m not to the end yet but I m itching to restart the whole thing just with another class.\n\nThe save system is a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as you can only have one save at a time. It gets auto-updated whenever you do certain stuff in the game. You cannot save manually (well you can but it doesnt do what we expect it to do)\n\nSo far I feel like playing and watching an episode of South Park which is probably the best compliment you can give to this game. Atmosphere is great and I find myself laughing out lout often enough to keep drawing the attention of my wife and cats )\n\n8/10\n\nTheres only minor things distracting from a "perfect" experience.

The Stick of Truth — not simply game according to the license: Parker and Stone personally participated in development, and the plan was realized by people who made Fallout: The New Vegas, and even earlier in Black Isle did the best role-playing games of the 90th. Unfortunately, even the best and the most experienced can be fond of own memoirs too. That, actually, also occurred. Authors will consistently see off us on all key and well familiar milestones of history of one mad city. Everything begins with a parable about an anal probe then before a look of players with whistle kalsonny gnomes, children Gotha, a Christmas ♥♥♥♥ Mr. Henki, Al Gore and his "Chelmedvedosvin", the Canadian sodomites, the zombie, Polotenchik and someone's huge hairy scrotum are carried by. To whom didn't get leading roles — are present at episodes, in the form of scenery or, at the worst, in the form of a dancing mug on the loading screen. The Stick of Truth hardly can be considered as independent chapter of South Park — it is rather interactive exhibition of achievements of the series, hardly squeezed in a framework of a conditional Japanese role-playing game from the 90th. The character with the workmate (one of heroes of series) goes on narrow paths of the city the South Park, is got involved in casual skirmishes, looks for the hidden treasures, puts on belongings and step by step fights with everyone. The Stick of Truth remains quite long game — at least for three-four evenings. This circumstance can become for someone critical: those who treats "South park" without awe, for certain will be tired of frequent and too easy fights, the bulky interface and similar awkwardness. And even the most devoted fans can get tired from terrible number of self-repetitions.

It took a year longer to release than it should've, but it's finally here. Is it the South Park game we've been waiting for ? 'Yes, absolutely !' is what I would say.\n\nLet's start with the graphics. The graphics are similar to the TV show, meaning they are 2D and have a bit of a grainy look. It's like watching the 2D show, there are basically no differences here.\n\nGameplay wise it's similar to games like Paper Mario. You walk around the town completing quests, searching for loot and taking part in battles. Quests are handed out by the people of South Park and normally consist of defeating certain enemies or finding specific items. Most of these quests are simple and relatively easy to complete, which fits the game in a way, but thankfully the main quest has a bit more variation and depth.\n\nNote that the whole game can be completed in 10-15 hours so it's not the biggest game we've ever seen or played. And that's a good thing, because near the end of the game it starts to overstay its welcome with its repetitive nature. 'Why', you ask ? Well, the battles are turn-based and except for some stronger enemies halfway through and near the end they never become exciting or very difficult. The special powers and summons are fun to use but you've probably seen most of it, or maybe all of it, within a couple of hours. And the fact that summons can't be used for boss fights is slightly disappointing.\n\nThe humor is just fantastic, as is the voice acting. You can tell a lot of work and love was put into it. This is one of the reasons you should play The Stick Of Truth. There's some hilarious stuff in it.\nOne small thing that doesn't really affect my opinion of the game but should be said anyway is the fact that some of the collectibles can't be collected anymore once you've finished the story. So, to all completionists out there; make sure you grab everything before wrapping up the story.\n\nAnyway, to wrap up my review:\nSouth Park The Stick Of Truth is the South Park game we've been waiting for and if you even remotely enjoy the show you owe it to yourself to play it at least once. You'll have a good time with it, believe me.\n\n[Rating: 86/100]","March 30, 2014","true","14.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","1"

Con todo lo que South Park puede llegar a aportar.\nSe siente como un episodio bastante extenso (unas 15 horas aproximadamente :P ) lleno de referencias hilarantes a episodios de South Park por todos lados.\nAlgo que yo hice fué ver episodios de South Park mientras estaba disfrutando del juego, y créanme que cada vez que volvía a jugar, me encontraba con algo referido a ese episodio!! así!!!\nLos poderes de cada raza, los poderes de Kyle, Stan, Kenny, Butters, Jimmy y Cartman derrochan risa.\nRealmente es un MUST PLAY no solo para los que miran asiduamente South Park, sino para cualquiera que quiera reirse un rato mientras disfruta de un fichín.\nMi única crítica negativa va hacia 2 cosas:\n- Algunas peleas las extienden demasiado\n- Las instrucciones para los poderes y ciertos "minijuegos" son las instrucciones peor redactadas de todos los videojuegos que he jugado. Parecen escritas por alguien que ni siquiera sabía lo que estaba haciendo.

It's a fun, over the top, hilarious, gross, rediculous, dumb, great time through and through.  Each step of the adventure with the boys carries you deeper into South Park for fantastic new laughs, and lots of old laughs and inside jokes from the start of the show.\n\nThe gamplay elements are simple, straight forward RPG mechanics, but that doesn't take away from the fun of beating up kids, bums, nazi fetus' and Manbearpig.  In fact I found it a relief as it let me really, just have fun in game without having to focus on heavy mechanics.  Enjoyed the story that much more.\n\nThere are TONS of weapons and costumes for you to find, Collectibles and friends to make.  Keeping you busy while you explore the whole of South Park, and beyond,  in a new and awesome way.  The atmosphere and art work are spot on and I couldn't have felt more IN South Park.\n\nAll in all it was a fantasticly fun experience, with lots of laughs and fun RPG elements.  Collecting most everything and beating the game should clock you in around 10-15hours.  Very well worth the long, long wait we all had for this game.","March 7, 2014","true","32.3"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

We play as a silent protagonist known as “new kid” and quickly gets forced into the fake war due to his inability to talk. In that time they will learn you have an amazing ability to fart and declare you are Dragonborn. Yep, very much South Park humor and flawlessly brought over from the show. For those that don't know what South Park is or have never seen it, it is a comedy show that loves to use very offensive humor toward religion, homosexuals, abortions and pretty much anything under the sun. If you get offended over those type of jokes don't play this game because it holds no punches back and features nudity, sex, bestiality and stuff that may get this review taken down if I mention them due to the extreme nature of the acts. Nonetheless, it is a very good thing they didn't censor anything adapting the shows humor into a video game.\n\nBut how is it as a game, you may be asking by now. Well it is pretty entertaining at first as you see what wacky moves characters have and the battle dialogue is still fresh but lose their charm after the 50th time and is further worsened due to some abilities you need to button mash on. It's not all bad though, you can can block an enemies attack if you press the guard button at the right time to lessen the damage you receive and that feature really lends the fights more interactivity and a big reason to pay attention instead of just lazily selecting moves from a list all the time. The strategy never gets too deep considering you can only have one ally fighting with you but that may be for the best, even being outnumbered the game is a tad on the easy side. When you are not fighting you will be exploring South Park and helping characters with their problems. After looting all their drawers of course.\n\nMoney isn't really hard to get if you like looting through every shiny object you pass by. With that cash you can buy items, armor and weapons which is pretty standard for RPGs. The difference in this is that all objects are unique so you wont be finding a similar looking weapon with just higher stats. You will get your hands on stuff that a child probably could at first like lighters, dodge-balls and wands but eventually get your hands on pretty dangerous objects like hammers or knifes. On top of that you can enchant your weapons to add status effects. It also features a pretty simply upgrade tree and perks you can get by adding friends on Facebook, usually by helping them with a quest. You traverse through the town in a 2D background but can move between the background and foreground like a regular 3D game. There are also occasional puzzles which usually involve farting on something and will usually lead you to one of the games many collectibles.\n\nGraphics in this game capture  the feel of the show flawlessly. Everything looks like it was made of paper cutouts and all walk in the same low budget style of the show for that signature South Park charm. Attacks are well animated and the high level abilities are always a joy to watch especially Kenny's. Characters all look like in the show and seeing them dressed up in medieval gears is amusing. The town all looks the same and they managed to connect the areas seen in the show into a natural feeling world map. User Interface is simple and efficient but the screens to access gear and skills is a bit cluttered. Enemy variety is pretty good but including elves, rats and all matter of crazy stuff that I won't mention to avoid spoilers. Also male genitals have quite a bit of detail to them having hairs and veins etc. Is that a good feature? I don't know that depends on the person..\n\nSound design is also flawlessly brought over from the show. Every character has their original voice actor and they don't half ♥♥♥ their roles in this game. The music is very South Parky including epic background music of Cartman singing about the Jewish. Sounds effects all sound very well done especially the blocking sound effect that sounds like steel clashing even though there is no steel. Stores feature some songs from the show like “Vote or Die” which I found hilarious listening to that in a Chinese restaurant.  Only bad thing I can say about the sound is that characters start moaning after you don't press a button for about five seconds or when you are not doing quests which is funny at first but quickly got pretty annoying.\n\nStory feels like one really awesome special episode of South Park. From start to finish it takes unexpected and often hilarious turns in true South Park fashion. Even the side-quests have their own funny mini stories with characters that don't get air time on the main plot. You travel to bizarre places in this game outside of the town of South Park including Canada for the silliest reason. It is quite hilarious seeing how seriously characters take their pretend war and the Stick of Truth which is said to control the universe. I won't explain much more about the story but believe me it captures the soul of the show perfectly.\n\nStick of Truth lasted me about 12 hours and I estimate it would last 14-15 if you want to complete everything. It was the perfect length and kept the plot-line from getting stale or the combat to get boring. I don't really see a reason to replay it unless you want to try a different class and are going for achievements. It is a really solid RPG for those looking for a game filled with dark humor or can tolerate it. This game completely captures the soul and style of the show in every conceivable way and is without a doubt a must have for fans of the show.","January 17, 2015","true","11.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's a great value if you can catch it on sale... I would have never bought it at the normal price-mark (but I am glad I got it on sale, was totally worth paying a few bucks for)\n\nBought this on a whim without knowing anything about the game and was very happy I did. I have never laughed so much playing an RPG in my life. This was a surprise hit for me. I really hope that South Park continues to make RPG games. They translated the show into a game effectively. It really feels like you are running around South Park trying to figure out what the heck is going on.\n\nParental Warning: they did not censor themselves in this game in any fashion. They really pushed the line of what I thought would even be allowed in games as far as thematic content (in the best way, this is just a warning to parents looking to buy this for their children, this isn't a kids show to begin with) It's just as adult as the show (which is a great thing for show fans)\n\nIf you are considering getting this game and are a South Park fan, you WILL NOT be disappointed.

It's a great value if you can catch it on sale... I would have never bought it at the normal price-mark (but I am glad I got it on sale, was totally worth paying a few bucks for)\n\nBought this on a whim without knowing anything about the game and was very happy I did. I have never laughed so much playing an RPG in my life. This was a surprise hit for me. I really hope that South Park continues to make RPG games. They translated the show into a game effectively. It really feels like you are running around South Park trying to figure out what the heck is going on.\n\nParental Warning: they did not censor themselves in this game in any fashion. They really pushed the line of what I thought would even be allowed in games as far as thematic content (in the best way, this is just a warning to parents looking to buy this for their children, this isn't a kids show to begin with) It's just as adult as the show (which is a great thing for show fans)\n\nIf you are considering getting this game and are a South Park fan, you WILL NOT be disappointed. I never thought I'd enjoy beating up little kids in a game. I was WRONG. It is supremely satisfyingly side splittingly funny.\n\nA+","June 8, 2015","true","23.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

The game is good enough on its own merit as well as satisfies the desires of South Park fandom.\n\nPros\n•	Started the game with Woad Paint (they called "Celtic Battle Paint" or something)\n•	Custom character (who is also in all the cinemas).\n•	South Park graphics, sounds, and humor\n•	Fun/simple game mechanics\n•	Fun/interesting equipment\n•	The environment was true to South Park and appropriately done for an open world game.\n•	Reasonable achievements (this is a new pro and con assessment that I am starting to add). The achievements in this game are basically story related, collecting a reasonable amount of hidden items (ex: 30 Chinpokemons), and accomplishing tasks in specific ways.\n•	Interesting story with many fun South Park throwbacks but still be enjoyable even if you aren’t a South Park fan.\n•	Pretty much everything\n\nCons\n•	I didn’t see Towlie, except on a loading screen \n•	The ending cinemas for me started glitching out and made my character invisible. Didn’t bother me too much because I basically played the game like 10hrs straight.\n•	A handful of times traveling the map became a chore but they had a lot of fast travel locations which helped make up the difference.\n•	Though this is simply nit-picking but equipment comparison stats didn’t seem accurate. It would tell me a melee weapon of 50-100 (x3) was better than a melee weapon that was 70-121 (x3) + fire damage. The weapon stats were accurate by themselves but a few weapons were indicated better or worse which were not.","April 17","true","17.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The story is, to put it bluntly, fantastic as it feels like I played a fourteen hour South Park episode where I was starring as a fellow eight year old who has moved to the small town.  The mechanics are relatively simple but entertaining and engaging enough that they didn't feel like a negative aspect at any point in the game.\n\nThe game is packed full of adventures that are new and yet familiar for any fans, or even casual watchers, of South Park.  You'll be running around all over South Park and the surrounding area and getting into trouble with all of your favorite characters throughout.  I haven't watched as much of the show as I would like though the person I was playing it with is a huge fan and we both laughed our asses off through the entirety of it all the same.  It even led to her bringing up clips of what certain items and locations were in reference to which made the game all that much more enjoyable.\n\nThe combat mechanics are similar to what I remember of Mario RPG in that every character has a variety of abilities that require pressing buttons at the right time or rotating the stick to get the full effect.  It kept combat interesting and engaging even with the relatively simple system.  The item system was fun as you find the most obnoxious weapons and gear and you can customize them with "strap-ons" that you find.\n\nI had twice the blast I was expecting from this game and I was expecting a good game.  I highly recommend this game to RPG gamers, South Park fans, and anyone looking for an extremely inappropriate adventure involving elves, nazis, aliens, and giant fetuses.  Give it a go and you won't be disappointed!","March 8","true","14.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I'm so happy this game was as good as I hoped it would be and more. I used to play loads of turn-based RPGs back in the day but eventually became disinterested with them after a couple disappointing titles (Star Ocean 4, Tales of Vesperia and Final Corridor XIII), but Obsidian have created a combat system which is both simple and yet has complexities which fits perfectly with Trey Parker and Matt Stone's hilarious writing and sense of humour. At several points during this game I had to stop playing because I was laughing so hard.\n\nBeing an Obsidian game, I was expecting a ton of bugs but surprisingly enough there were very few (mainly some patch equipping and stuck in cutscenes issues). I'm glad they took time to hire a competent QA department this time round as I think the amount of bugs present in Fallout: New Vegas upon release unfortunately impacted the reception of a game which ultimately was better than Fallout 3 in many ways.\n\nThe Stick of Truth is one of those games where you can't talk about it in much detail with someone who is a fan of South Park but has yet to play it, because you don't want to spoil the sheer enjoyment they'll have from playing this game. You're actually excited for them to play and experience it for themselves - it's that ♥♥♥♥ing good.","April 4, 2014","true","18.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

If you are a fan of the series dont think it twice and BUY IT NOW.\n\n+Story\nThe game is at the quality of the series and there can be no better success. Everything you know of South Park is in the game and the entire game it's like a special episode but you can form part of it. You can burst the face to Al Gore, it's what all of us want when we are watching the series.\n+Combat\nA RPG with turn-based combat and it is not boring... YES! finally! has been a while. The special attacks of every character are amazing and funny if you dont laugh playing Princess Kenny, seriously, go to doctor.\nI recommend playing this in Hardcore difficulty, normal and casual it's just too easy and boring. Nothing can kill you and even the boss battles is just press a single key and see ya.\n+Music\nWe have all the greatest hits of the series, Faith +1, Jennifer Lopez and his tacos, I'm a Little Bit Country... A lot of songs you've heard before but the OST of the game is also great and it's full of references of other franchises (Zelda, TES, Castlevania...). Jimmy songs are AWESOME.\n+Map\nWell, we can explore the entire town of South Park and even Canada! well, the map is not very huge but well it's a town.\n+Customization\nThis is a RPG and this needs a lot of items, armors, hairs and stuff like that and in this one you have all of that and even more. The amount of crazy and stupid items there is insane. You will not have complaints about this.\n+Cartman\nBecause he always make you laugh. It's a safe bet.\n\n-Duration\nI played 15.6 hours and I almost have everything in the game. I just need do 2 or 3 side-quest and It's done except the collectibles.\n-Butters\nBecause he is always insufferable.\n\nIt's a game completly oriented to the fans.

Most tie in games are terrible and made only to make money or cash in on something that is popular at the moment.  Trey and Matt, along with Obsidian Ent. have crafted a wonderful game that looks and feels like South Park, on top of being very fun to play.\n\nThis has been a dream type game for me over the years, something I would create in Game Dev Tycoon... take my favorite rpg developers and stick them with working with the south park writers on a south park RPG. It looks and feels like the damn tv show for crying out loud! Obsidian has done it again, managed to keep me glued to the monitor hours into the night. I have never laughed anywhere close to this much during a game, it is laugh out loud hilarious and will have you on the floor laughing non stop.\n\nThere could be more pc settings and it could use a little balance in difficulty but those are the only negatives I can think of. The combat is fun, the story and writing is top notch, as is the atmosphere and the controls. They could have done a crap game and made money with the South Park license but instead the writers and Obsidian have put there heart and soul into this game.\n\nIf you are a South Park fan or an Obsidian fan like me, don't even think twice go and buy this game ASAP. If you are on the fence about this game go read Giantbombs revierw (5/5), PC gamers review or even go watch Total Biscuits WTF is South Park vide on youtube, agree with those the most so far. Only 3-4 hours into it so far but boy have I had a blast! Cartman and all you're favorite south park characters are here as you (The new Kid in town) go on adventures while laughing your ♥♥♥ off.\n\nMUST OWN game, Obsidian and Trey/Matt deserve a pat on the back for a job well done.

It's everything you'd expect from South Park. It's extreme, profane, obscene, and often disturbing.\n\nThe game mechanics are excellent. The various status effects are meaningful and useful. Each character has different abilities both in and out of combat. The game features mostly standard turn-based RPG mechanics, but mixes it up a bit. For example, using the bard's lullaby song requires you to perform a miniature version of Dance Dance Revolution. In the world map, it's more of an adventure game with very simple puzzle elements. Later in the game, the developers mix things up in the world map when you go to Canada and it switches to a top-down retro RPG view.\n\nThere are loads of collectables. You collect Facebook friends throughout town. You collect Pokemon knock off figures. You collect costumes and equipment. There's a lot of equipment, but none of it feels arbitrary. Depending on your play style, you can find a use for just about every piece of equipment. There are enhancement items to modify your equipment with that augment your play style.\n\nThe DLC are worthless really. The items are level 2 and are quickly replaced by better equipment. I bought them, but didn't use them.\n\nI don't know if I'd say the game has replay value. I enjoyed it a lot, but once the story is over, there is a limited amount of side quests to finish. The game is pure fun from start to finish and definitely worth at least one play through.","December 31, 2014","true","20.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The gameplay is easy, the story is fantastic, and it's just a really well made game.\n\nYou do get level capped at 15, and on normal you can easily take out waves of enemies.\n\nWith all that being said I am easily going to play this again and possible again as this is the first game I actually want to 100% in a long time.

I have to say that was a lot of laughs and a lot of fun.  Hardcore RPG players may not enjoy it as much as it sort of feels like it is on rails, but there are still a lot of secrets to uncover.  The fighting system is done in the same vein of JRPGs, but it knows it's other RPGs well. It makes fun of the things you always think about in an RPG while being what it does best. Offensive, Abusive and very very sexually crude.  It's Southpark and if you are a fan of it even slightly. You will appreciate this game.  I personally was not expecting very much from it. I was hoping to laugh, but I got so much more from it. It made me laugh more than I think I have laughed during a game before.  It shows that Trey and Matt really did the right thing by standing by it's side during the making of it.  I have heard a lot of people saying that the game is only 14 hours long. I have played it longer than that by looking for secrets and getting everything I can out of the game.  I have also hear that there is no replay ability with the game.  I disagree.  Reason being.  I felt like i was actually IN Southpark.  I would say it's like playing a hillarioius movie.  If you like a movie. You are gonna watch it again.  If you like Southpark. You are probably going to watch episodes again.  So if you like those things. You will love the game. Those seeking a little bit of challenge I would say put it up past "normal".  There are a few parts that take a bit of thinking and pairing of your buddies. If I had to rate this. I would break it into 2 categories. Fun 9.5/10  Gameplay 8.0/10.   Giving it and 8.75 total. If you are not a fan of Southpark. You might want to overlook it.  While you can still enjoy it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darthmarsden/recommended/213670/","darthmarsden","THE Darth Masochist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darthmarsden/","1426 products in account","In brief: extremely high quality RPG that will definitely NOT appeal to anyone who doesn't like South Park.\n\nIn boxers: Although South Park has had several games in the past (most notably the incredibly dull Turok 2 TC), it's only in recent years that the makers of the show, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, have been directly involved in the making of any tie-in games, and it shows. The quality of these games has improved dramatically, finally culminating in The Stick of Truth, a truly fantastic experience that feels like a true labour of love from everyone involved.\n\nPlaying as The New Kid (who you can customize to an almost insane degree), you barely last 30 seconds outside before  you're drawn in to the Warriors and Wizards-style LARPing of the other South Park kids, joining up with Cartman and (Princess) Kenny's humans to take on Stan and Kyle's Drow Elves for possession of the titular Stick of Truth - which is blatantly just a Macguffin designed to keep the game going.\n\nTrey and Matt directly approached Obsidian Entertainment to develop this game due to Trey's love of RPGs, and it turned out to be an inspired choice. The game is an RPG through and through, and a pretty damn good one at that. There are four character classes you can choose from - Warrior, Mage, Thief and (of course) Jew - though aside from the special attacks each class gains, there's really not a whole lot of difference between each one. It's the combat where the differences to standard JRPGs show up to add variety to things.\n\nFirst is the addition of quick-time style button prompts when attacking or defending which allow you to increase the damage you dish out or reduce the amount you take. Learning to use this is not only massively helpful in battle, but it also means you never feel uninvolved in combat, which is a welcome change from the norm. You can also use an item AND attack in the same turn, which, while offering a large degree of tactical usefulness, does mean that combat rarely becomes particularly challenging as a result, especially once you discover the importance of status effects.\n\nThere's four main effects you can apply to enemies - Bleeding, Freezing, Grossed Out and On Fire. Each of these has its own pros and cons, but once you realise how easy it is to apply them (especially once you find ranged weapons that can hit multiple opponents), you'll quickly come to find that combat loses a huge amount of its appeal and ends up losing a lot of its appeal as a result.\n\nThat said, if the combat ends up becoming a bit of a chore, then it's fortunate that little else about the game does.There is a surprisingly large amount to do in this game, from finding Jesus (twice) to catching all the Chinpokemon to dealing with the homeless problem, there's an absolute ton of things to do around South Park, which is rendered absolutely perfectly. It really does look and feel exactly like the TV show, to the point where anyone passing by might ask you what episode you're watching. A huge amount of work has gone into making this a faithful adaptation, and it shows.\n\nLength-wise, the game will last you anywhere between 12-15 hours, which may seem short, but unlike most RPGs there's very little wasted time here. The level cap is 15, which you'll hit around the 2/3rds point, and once you hit that you can pretty much just avoid combat entirely and focus on finishing the story, which is every bit as insane as the show itself, taking in aliens, goth kids, cootie-ridden girls, abortions, Zombie Nazis and Canada. Not necessarily in that order.\n\nTrey and Matt voice the majority of the characters as in the show, along with a few others helping them along the way, and although a few characters sound a little off (Officer Barbrady in particular sounds like someone doing an impression of him rather than the original voice actor) there's a huge number of characters from the show's history on display here in one form or another. There's a few people missing, but then again if they included everyone there wouldn't be much wiggle room for a sequel now, would there?\n\nSome people will tell you that there's plenty of replayability to be had, but those people are talking out of their anal probes. There's few differences between classes, rendering that aspect rather pointless, and there's only one point where the plot splits... which lasts all of 30 minutes before both paths snap back into one. Any replayability to be gained is simply from wanting to experience the plot elements a second time, which is certainly valid, but this really isn't a game designed to be played over and over again.\n\nWhich leads to the price. I can't help feeling that paying full price for this game is really justified. It may be a good game - and trust me, it's VERY good - but on Steam they're asking for £40, which is far too much. It's worth around half that. Also, don't bother purchasing the clothing packs (the 'Samurai Spaceman' and 'Ultimate Fellowship' bundles), as they simply add extra outfits that, while nice, don't really add anything to the game itself and serve only as basic pre-order nonsense. If they decide to release story-based DLC (and I hope they do!), then that'll be worth a look, but I wouldn't recommend anything else.\n\nThis is very much a South Park game first and an RPG second, so if you're not willing to get on board with the twisted, insane humour of the show then you won't find much to entertain you here, especially once the game really gets going. But for everyone else, this is a fantastic game with few flaws that I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending.\n\nBecause really, what other game lets you throw a bloody tampon at enemies, then whack them with a giant ♥♥♥♥♥, gross them out, circumcise them, cause them to bleed into unconsciousness and then fart on them when they're lying beaten and broken on the ground? (And no, I'm not making a word of that up.)","April 13, 2014","true","17.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Replay value is definetely there, with each class (mage, warrior, thief, and jew) all having their unique abilities and playstyles. I do plan to playthrough one more time, as there is also room to miss some stuff (collectables and what not, appealing to perfectionists). The gameplay itself manages to not become too repititive, with new enemies and buddies (companions) constantly being introduced. Finally, if you enjoy the humor that the show contains, then this game is pretty much just that.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/derungrund/recommended/213670/","derungrund","Der Ungrund","http://steamcommunity.com/id/derungrund/","388 products in account","Probably one of the better PC games to be made from a liscenced property since......"Beavis and Butthead in Virtual Stupidity" maybe?   It perfectly translates the look and tone of the TV show to a video game format.  Which isn't to say it's perfect, though, either as an RPG or as a piece of "South Park."  As an RPG, the game mechanics are there for a good amount of depth.  Attacks do different types of damage, special moves often involve the stacking of various status effects to do maximum damage, and enemies have different vulnerabilities. So theoretically the game's mechanics could be used to design some fairly interesting fights.  Unfortunately, even on the hardest difficulty fights are incredibly easy.  Special attacks do so much damage that you usually don't have to worry about what type of damage you are doing, to the point that one wonders why the designers bothered implementing the various damage types and status effects at all.  I can't think of a game that would benefit more from a fan made difficulty mod than this as the potential for depth is there in the game's mechanics, it's just that the designers never really tap into this depth in combat design.\n\nAs "South Park" the game is much better, although it does suffer from the repetition of way too many jokes from the TV show.  This is especially troublesome in instances where these recycled bits come from later in the series run and thus were never that funny in their first incarnation (see, for example, Morgan Freeman gets a freckle).  However, the game does have many inspired moments all its own (a sex scene fight that I won't go into detail over lest I spoil it sticks out in particular) and ultimately part of this is probably due to the length of the game's development more than anything (Parker and Stone canabalized a good deal of the game's storyline in their Game of Thrones themed, three part episode last season, which ended up stealing the game's thunder somewhat.  I suspect some of these jokes would have had more impact had the game been released first, as it was originally planned).   Most importantly, though, even if the jokes occasionally fall flat, the game works first and foremost as a narrative.  The game's central conceit of basing an RPG around kids playing fantasy dress up is brilliant and Parker and Stone are good enough at adapting their story telling and humor to video games as a medium that it kind of makes me wish that they'd write an original RPG.\n\nIn the end, this is a solid, if uninspired, RPG despite its gameplay flaws and, taken as a whole, represents "South Park" at its most epic and comprehensive. Parker and Stone haven't tried to go this big, in terms of the scope of the series, since "Bigger, Longer, and Uncut."  Given that the game reaches so much farther than the show has in years, it's slightly easier to forgive the overreliance on recycled material.","June 13, 2014","true","20.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

For I feel that they manage to do wat they set out to do, so damn well. That I'm having to really strain myself to find something to gripe about.\n\n...\n\nI quess I could grumble a bit about the turn-based combat system, it feels a bit too standard, run-of-the-mill, copy-paste..\nSeveral battles became too easy after I found the most optimal way around them, I believe (if my tally is to be believed) that I died the total of 4-times. During the total of.... 15-hours of gameplay that it took me to finish the game, I feel that's a rather positive ratio.\n\nWhilst on the subject of combat, I'm not that impressed by the small amount of input lag I got when using a 360-pad. I've heard that it might have something to do with the game being locked at 30fps, it's a bit annoying when a perfectly timed block decides that it happened a split second too late and this happened way too many times to count.\n\n\nThe Audio-Visual style follows that of the TV-series, characters bob around imitating walking, the original cast does what it does best, everything looks like paper cut-outs.. The works.\n\nThe game has a lot of in-jokes and references to the TV-series and those who haven't seen much of the series might feel a bit left-out, but luckily being a keen fan of the series is not reguired.\n\nThere are collectables, yay... (HURRRGGGGGHHHH)\n\nThere are items to use, the same way as they do in other RPG's..\n\n...\n\n\nSIGH\n\n\n...\n\n\nDo you know how hard it is to find something to grumble about this game?...\n\n\nYou know what?

Took me roughly 14 hours to finish, making it alot longer of a game than I figured it would be. Replay value is definetely there, with each class (mage, warrior, thief, and jew) all having their unique abilities and playstyles. I do plan to playthrough one more time, as there is also room to miss some stuff (collectables and what not, appealing to perfectionists). The gameplay itself manages to not become too repititive, with new enemies and buddies (companions) constantly being introduced. Finally, if you enjoy the humor that the show contains, then this game is pretty much just that.

[No grinding required to complete the game]\n+ Jew class is OP as ♥♥♥♥. [If you enjoy playing as a Jew, this isn't a problem]\n+ You get to visit Canada. [I'm Canadian, deal]\n\nCons\n- Overpriced [Don't pay more than 30 dollars for this]\n- Campaign is too short [Only 12-15 hours depending if you're going for 100%]\n- Some achievements are bugged and require you to reload hours of game play to fix. [Still not patched either]\n- Missible items which hinder achievements [Might have to restart entire campaign]\n- Too easy [For Hardcore gamers, this game isn't even remotely challenging, too many exploitable builds]\n- Some achievements are incredibly technical and can only be achieved in one or two spots in the entire game.\n- Jew Class is OP [Class balance might be an issue for some people, not me, I like the Jew]\n- Party system is lacking and feels tacked on. [Some character don't have enough utility and aren't worth using]\n\nFinal Thoughts\nHope that helps. A lot of people downvoted this game just due to price point which I feel is an unfair judgement of how good the game actually is, It's a great game, just not perfect. It's definitely not worth anything over 30 dollars and this is coming from someone who bought the 90 dollar collectors edition with the Cartman Wizard figure and then re-purchased it again on Steam for like 30 dollars again when it was on sale. It's not a 60 dollar title... it's not even a 40 dollar title...

As the new kid in South Park, you get involved in a LARP opposing Cartman's Humans against Kyle's Elves, as the quiet little mountain town is place to events beyond what the kids anticipated.\n\nPros: This is a South Park fan's heaven. Fan service from across all seasons are fulfilled, as almost every characters from the show are either there or referenced at some level. Most loot are winks to episodes: a sarcastiball trophy, a shake weight, an Antonio Banderas love doll, an Okama Gamesphere, and hundreds more. If an episode reference wasn't in the loot, it's out there on display in a kid's room or closet. Every shop or radio play songs from the show (Chef, Jennifer Lopez, DVDA songs, you name it). The game smells of Matt Stone and Trey Parker's very-involved participation: the voice acting, the politically incorrect script and often down right disgusting language, the humor and how it critiques society. You feel like you're an actual character in South Park, forth wall breaks saved by the fact that you're playing a game about playing a game. Graphically, it looks exactly like the show, nothing groundbreaking but exactly what you'd expect.\n\nCons: The game is extremely basic, and the mechanics have little to no depth, save a few class skills. You equip 2 weapons and 3 pieces of armor with one or two customizable perk slots, some of which can be dyed assuming you found that dye color tube in-game, and some wigs or face paints that don't serve any purpose. The story is short, and extremely bare-bones. If not for the gameplay time and the exploration only fans will care about, you could fit the plot into a South Park movie. Skipping all that and the couple of optional sidequests you can finish the game in 10 hours (I bet many did it in less) with little replayability.\n\nVerdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list\n\nIf you are not a fan of South Park, STAY AWAY! But if you are, this is an unquestionable must have. To the fan, it's a Season worth of content, jokes, running gags and nostalgia. South Park: The Stick of Truth is worth every dollar.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","December 29, 2014","true","54.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Battles are easy and the system is very simple, yet I wasn't bored, as enemies are so, uh, unusual you are waiting what kind of wacky attack they will use next.\nI used to watch South Park season 1 back in the... 1998? but didn't come back watching after that (if it was on some public channel I would, most likely), so going back to South Park and meeting all these new (to me) characters was an awesome experience. Especially when this "dungeons and dragons" story is just a kid's game of pretending to be wizards, warriors etc., with everyone being fully aware of that and throwing comments like "what's with this stupid turn-based system?" and more: farts are "magic", coffee is a "speed potion" etc. and I enjoyed this aspect of the game world a lot.\nThere is only one thing I didn't like (besides it being so short, as I really wanted the game to last longer and was sad it's already over): some songs are recycled from the show and don't fit the theme, for example there is Lemmiwinks song, yet you are the "hero" now...? Same goes with abortion song mentioning "Christmas", which is out of place in the context of the game story.\n\nAnyway if you enjoy South Park, you should enjoy this game as well, despite its simplicity.","April 26, 2014","true","15.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The presentation is pitch perfect and all the characters are voiced by their original voice actors (mostly Trey Parker and Matt Stone). Perfect characters aside, the combat is another robust feature. It's easy to learn, but difficult to master; even if you've put hours in it. The story makes you feel both like an observer and a vital part of it at the same time, since you get to witness epic cutscenes and make crucial joices which influence the unfolding of the story. The humor, however, is what takes the ovations from the crowd, but beware - only long time South Park fans will get all the nods and references to various episodes, as well as feel more closely bound to classic characters. It's crude, offensive, with poor taste sometimes, but that cynical attitude makes South Park stand out from the crowd of mainstream TV flicks.  All and all, the game would be perfect if it had been a little more appealing to the newcomer audience, but I urge you to at least watch some episodes before you buy it, prefferably from the newer seasons.","April 9, 2014","true","17.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

The story makes you feel both like an observer and a vital part of it at the same time, since you get to witness epic cutscenes and make crucial joices which influence the unfolding of the story. The humor, however, is what takes the ovations from the crowd, but beware - only long time South Park fans will get all the nods and references to various episodes, as well as feel more closely bound to classic characters. It's crude, offensive, with poor taste sometimes, but that cynical attitude makes South Park stand out from the crowd of mainstream TV flicks.  All and all, the game would be perfect if it had been a little more appealing to the newcomer audience, but I urge you to at least watch some episodes before you buy it, prefferably from the newer seasons.","April 9, 2014","true","17.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chronicdiscord/recommended/213670/","chronicdiscord","chronicdiscord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chronicdiscord/","1221 products in account","TL;DR  - Great game, some flaws, a game no South Park or RPG fan should miss.\n\nTaking place immediately after the Game of Thrones inspired 244th through 247th episodes of the series in which the town's population have gone through the Blackest of Black Fridays, fighting to the death over random stuff on sale and in which game console the Boys should stake their futures.  The Stick of Truth is the Boys playing a full blown Live Action Role Playing Game in South Park even as sinister forces work against the unsuspecting town.  In comes the New Kid, and in keeping with the tropes set down by the genre, this silent protagonist must navigate the conflict between two warring factions as they seek to save the day.\n\nUnfortunately the game feels like a bunch of it hit the cutting room floor, not for lack of inspiration, but for lack of funds.  The Stick of Truth suffers from being made by Obsidian and originally set to be published by the defunct THQ - this defuncting having occurred during the game's development and risking the fate of the game.  Obsidian representatives have on more than one occasion said their company nearly ran out of funds entirely while making this game.\n\nAllow me to explain my gripes, and I apologize for the minor spoilers, I will try to keep it minimal.\n\nLiterally nothing you do will impact the game.  The two factions at war serve no purpose, they are a choice with no consequence.  You can obtain costumes which would imply allegiance to one or the other faction, but it has zero impact on the game.  You don't get a different power, you don't get a different weapon, you don't get a different hair cut even, you get sweet ♥♥♥♥ all for siding with either.\n\nIn most similarly designed games - the Fallout, Elder Scrolls, and Forgotten Realms series in particular, you will find that wearing the clothes of a faction impacts that faction's opinion of you and what you do and how you do it also factors into their responses.  Not so much here, again, nothing you do matters.  No quest will ensure the 5th graders will attack your enemy, reducing their combat effectiveness later in the game.  No dialogue will allow you to unlock a special companion.  Stealing from someone will not make people think less of you.\n\nThe game zips through story at a rather high speed, you go from arc to arc with little time to engage in what is happening.  Had the player a little more engagement with the events and characters, a branching story, this would not be a problem.  As it is however, you end up with a game that is boring to replay, most games of this type are awesome for replayability.\n\nThere are bugs, you will find yourself disappearing for no reason, and the camera focus moving off to the wrong part of the map.  You will need to restart the game to fix these sadly, but luckily they are not very common.\n\nOh lord, loading screens.  The game is not a graphically intense thing, it should not need so many.\n\nDo not take these complaints as hate for the game, this is disappointment.  There could have been more to this, it could have been a clear Game of the Year, instead of just being one of the better games.\n\nCombat is that of Super Mario RPG and it's kin, a very forgiving QTE-ish element is present to improve your attacks' and abilities' power.  Except for a lack in variety of combat, this is great.  And there are a few little full blown QTEs in game, but they also give plenty of reaction time and are clear with what to do.  This is easy enough that a child can play through the whole game without needing a hand.\n\nThe graphics are great, everything feels natural and looks like it belongs.  The art team should be given high jobs and blow fives.  The setting is wonderful, the town of South Park feels smaller than it should be, but what is there is alive and interesting.  I wish it was bigger to match the portrayal of the town from television, but we got a good chunk to play with.  The music, the voice acting, these are completely flawless.  They match the show in every way.  This all because the game was developed with close ties to South Park Studios who make the show.\n\nIf this game were not a South Park game, I would recommend it for everyone.  As it is however, anyone who is into RPGs and legally old enough to have a Steam account will have to do.","March 27, 2015","true","20.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Fans of the South Park series will love this game because of the refrences from the episodes of South Park layered in the game from the radio, characters, and much more. The gameplay is turn based with the player's charater and companions having to interact with thier desired move by timing mouse clicks or button presses at the right time. This mechanic makes the turn based gameplay a bit more interesting then choosing the desired attack by making players interact more in battle. It wouldn't be South Park without making fun of something or someone so the game makes fun of famous game titles like Skyrim with the use of 'dragon shout' by farting on players, which can be combined with your other attacks or used to interupt an enemy charging up their special attack. There are four classes to choose from one of them being the Jew class that can actaully be overpowered at times, but is a funny reference to one of the original characters from the south park series. The problems i have with this game are some of the achievements being difficult, some actions freezing up causing players to load from last save, and bad implemintation any replayability. The achievements are not only difficult but ridiculious because forgeting to talk to certain people to be on your friends list or missing a complete set of armor means having to restart the entire game to get back to the point you missed. The character freezing has happend only a few times but not manually saving before hand may cause people hours of backtracking as it only loads manual saves instead of auto saves. Replayability of this game is weaksauce as the end of the game is free roam with limited areas to go to and nothing really to do but walk around and finish up certain achievements. A new game plus would have been good here but I think the developers did this intentually so players would have to start over as a new character to get more hours out of this game. Overall this game is great even with some of the gripes mentioned. Fans and non fans of the South Park series will really enjoy this game unless you don't like crude humor then this might not be your game. I strongly recommend this game for the sheer fun and laughter it gives to players and hours of fun it has to offer. If you can get this game at a reduced price even better!","May 30","true","39.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Seriously, though... after 5 full play throughs and acquiring all of the achievements, I can say that I've checked out every nook and cranny of this game. It's genius. For me, the game and gameplay itself is not complicated at all, as there is no real crafting or spellbooks and the kinds of things we've all come to expect in fantasy-themed games. For me rather, it is the script/plot, the characters and the environment that are beyond brilliant. As many other reviewers have noted, you are basically in one long episode of South Park. The humor is crude, the items you find are equal parts filthy and "cute", the farts are deadly, and the snuke is buried deep within the most cavernous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (pun intended) that you can possiby imagine... I can only say that to me the wait for this game was entirely worth it and I hope that we get more SP games or DLC like this. I will still play this again in the future, as even by the end of the 5th play through, I found myself laughing so hard I was in tears at points in the game that I'd already been through... like a favorite episode of SP that you can watch over and over again, this game is hilarious.","March 4, 2014","true","140.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

What I wanted most out of this game is for it to bring me into the world of South Park and allow me to join in on the wacky rides that Kenny, Kyle, Stan, and Cartman get into. And that is exactly what is going on. I didn't expect the absurd amount of detail that you find throughout the world. It's not just do that quest do this quest move on, really take some time to explore you'll find countless amounts of subtle farts of hilarity.\n\nWhat else that shocked me is how good the combat it. Let's face it turn based isn't for everyone, but I can't help but adore it when you get all these wacky weapons and skills. It also takes some strategy to get it right, sometimes you might not simpily have the right companions or maybe you're too undergeared or maybe you just have bad reaction time and missed a few blocks that killed you. Overall the RPG aspect of this game is amazing as well.\n\nAs a game reviewer on Youtube for over two years now I've seen my fair share of awesome and equally ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games. I don't know what it is about South Park: The Stick of Truth but it's easily one of my most cherished additions to my collection.\n\n\nI HIGHLY suggest you buy the game and experience the game first hand but if you don't have the funding or simily prefer playthroughs I have started one on my channel and you're more than welcome to join me on my adventure. But please consider buying this game and supporting the wonderful people that took the time to make this.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWQd5lMQmGw\n","March 5, 2014","true","12.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dj_malloc/recommended/213670/","dj_malloc","Malloc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dj_malloc/","1185 products in account","It might sound like a backhanded compliment to call something "The Best South Park Game", but it's probably something South Park Studios would gladly slap on the box of this thing with all the underhandedness that that would entail, so we'll run with that. It's relevant that it's actually the best South Park game by a massive, orders-of-magnitude margin and actually manages to be a halfway decent game in its own right.\n\nThe plot revolves around your character, the New Kid, moving into a vacant house in South Park with your mom and dad. Within short order you stumble across the kids from the show who are fully wrapped up in a 4th grade LARPing session revolving around the Stick of Truth. You're quickly enlisted to help in the conflict between the Humans, led by Cartman, versus the Jewish Elves led by Kyle.\n\nIf you saw the "Console Wars" episodes of the show, they lead directly into this game in a way I don't think I've actually seen a licensed product do before. It's legitimately worth streaming them online prior to playing the game, as the game could really be considered just an extension of that plotline.\n\nIt's also a fun contrast to see what happens when the writers of the show aren't bound by Comedy Central's standards and practices. South Park as a show is known for pushing the envelope pretty seriously. South Park the movie had something like 250 uses of the word "♥♥♥♥", was obscenely violent, had Satan in a gay relationship with a (then still alive) Saddam Husein, and featured a giant talking clitoris onscreen as a plot macguffin.\n\nThe game puts the movie to absolute shame in terms of pure raunch.\n\nThis is easily the most gleefully offensive South Park has ever gotten, and they have things in this game the MPAA would've balked at. Were this a film it would've quite easily landed an NC-17 rating. I don't even want to spoil any of it because it's been a really long time since I've been genuinely shocked by a game, and this game managed to pull it off several times over the course of its 15 hours or so. Just by way of a comparatively mild example: You get "summmon" items in the game in a nod to Final Fantasy's summon mechanic, but here it's assorted bit characters from the show. One of them is Mr. Slave, who pulls his pants down and lands ♥♥♥-first on your enemies before stuffing them inside of him while he moans with pleasure (in my case he performed this move against a 4th grade hall monitor, which means I've played a game where an adult stuffs a child up his ♥♥♥ as an attack. Try to imagine if they'd put that in a movie, even as a joke.)\n\nGet ready for a lot of cartoon nudity, basically.\n\nIt's not all sex jokes, either. The plot starts as a bunch of 4th graders playing live action Dungeons and Dragons but things dramatically escalate from there and the stakes become much more real-world and cheerily violent and dark, even as the game (very amusingly) never loses sight of the fact that you're just some 12 year old kid playing pretend.\n\nThis is used to attach a lot of legitimate RPG mechanics onto the game as well.You're given the ability to customize your character's appearance, though not their gender -- you're always male. To be fair the game does give a perfectly sensible plot reason for this and it's played up for humor later. You can find and equip new gear as well as "Materia" of a sort (here called "Weapon Strap-Ons" because of course) and as the game progresses you get a series of spells that can be used outside of combat for environmental challenges, like using your "Dragonshout" power (which is a fart, naturally) to ignite open flames and light anything behind them on fire to clear a path.\n\nBosses include the denizens of a meth lab, red headed hall monitors, goth kids, 16 year old girls, drunk hobos, assorted wildlife, nazi zombie cattle, aborted fetuses, and in one memorable instance your father's swinging scrotum which you have to dodge using a quicktime event.\n\nSomehow it all actually holds together in the gameplay department. Part of this is due to the game being made by Obsidian who know their way around an RPG and have a good sense of how to interweave gameplay and narrative. The game's pacing is almost weirdly solid, even as it sticks to the fundamentals. There's a definitive first, second, and third act; sub quests are handed out at an even clip; you're given a narrative break after major plot events in the form of the day ending. It has the usual South Park problem where they never seem quite sure how to end the thing and it winds up getting so ridiculous that when it finally wraps everything up it kind of just...Stops, anticlimactically (which the game promptly lampshades and mocks, so).\n\nOn the downside, the game is really easy, to the point where combat actually gets kind of boring because some of the crew's powers are so overbearingly good. You're allowed to use an item at every turn before attacking; there's an item (coffee) that allows you to attack twice. If you're willing to just stock up on coffee and pound it every round for the difficult-ish fights they become snore-inducingly easy even on Hardcore difficulty. If you want challenge out of this you sort of have to make it yourself, because you almost have to try if you want to lose.\n\nIt also means that while there's a good amount of variety to the jokes, just because of the nature of turn-based RPG games you're going to start eventually hearing a lot of the same lines over and over again. Attack animations also cannot be skipped or disabled, which gets old quick as the really good ones come with comensurately lengthy animations attached to them.\n\nIt's stuff that probably could've been ironed out if the game had a little more time in the oven, but if you've read about the very troubled history of the development of this game it's actually pretty wild that it turned out as good as it did, where I have to scrape a bit if I want to find things to complain about.\n\nBasically, it's short but it's reasonably mechanically solid, well voice acted, looks exactly like the show, and is honestly pretty funny and worth playing for the jaw-dropping level of objectionable content they managed to cram into basically every section of the game on what seems to have been a dare. Needless to say if you're easily offended or like to consider yourself above relentlessly juvenile humor because you worry deeply about what others will think about your values system instead of, say, reviewing the game in a public place so everyone will know you played and enjoyed it despite said objectionable content, then you should probably not bother with this game at all. If the idea of jokes about abortion, nazis, pedophiles, Canada, things that can be found inside Mr. Slave's colon (condoms, puppets, live bats, a working flashlight, an iPhone, etc.) and so forth doesn't sound like your cup of tea, your enjoyment of this game will probably be somewhat limited.","August 4, 2014","true","17.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Combat is pretty easy, at least if you have a min/max mentality when it comes to choosing companions, gear, and spells.  Fortunately, there's just enough combat in the game to balance out the exploration aspect without become too overly boring by the end of the game (for South Park fans, at least).  The game does a super job of recreating all the landmarks of the TV show and the voice acting is exactly what a fan would hope for.  I do get a little bit of screen tearing that I haven't been able to get rid of, but it's not enough of a problem to sour the game for me.  Stick of Truth features superb controller support and I appreciated being able to earn Steam achievements and play without launching UPlay even though this is an Ubisoft game.

South Park: The Stick of Truth is a funny, well made game that fits snuggly inbetween both examples above.  I finished the game after about 10 hours of playing, which is very respectable, and provides you with juuuust enough that, perhaps later on, you'll pick up a mouse and keyboard (Or controller) and try it again. The dialogue is hilarious, the gameplay is good, and Mr. Slave's... "storage" is scary. You can meet all your more known South Park characters, like Randy Marsh, Mr. Hankey, The Underpants Gnomes... Jesus... But its not necessary to do so, and you can just go along the story without giving a damn. I did not stray from the main quest, and to reach 10 hours with minimal sidequest completion is great. You don't have to go into places you don't want to, either. I know you can enter the sewers, but I decided not to unless the game forced me, after a long history of playing games with forced sewer gameplay. I was quite happy that I didn't have to go at all. As a result, I didn't meet The Christmas Poo, but I could live with that.\n\nThe idea of a silent protagonist was obviously going to be a difficult thing to pull off, and South Park Studios and Obsidian Entertainment have pulled it off successfully. So congratulations to them. One thing I was unhappy with was the abilities, and how the were performed. almost everything involved mashing buttons on the keyboard or mouse. Wanted to poop? Mash a button. Want to use Jimmys abilities? Mash a button. Want Cartman to fat? Mash a button. It was very tedious and something I never really wanted to do after a while - But in order to win against many opponents, you needed to either A: mash these buttons, or B: use the normal attack, which did absolutely pitiful amounts of damage lategame. If you resorted to option B, you STILL have to press buttons, only this time, instead of mashing, it was timed with little "Ding" sounds, and a little flashing light. After a while, you could play the game with your eyes closed. In fact, to test this, I beat the final boss with my eyes closed (Except for the finale, which isn't really a battle. But I won't spoil it).\n\nIs the game good? I'd say so.\n\nIs it replayable? Maybe after a while.\n\nDo I recommend it? Well, if you don't mind mashing singular buttons, which are being timed against you, and are occaisionally difficult to pull off (such as creating ♥♥♥♥ Nuggets), then I guess its worth the money.","March 12, 2014","true","11.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Surely it's not the lengthiest RPG (with a barely 15 hour long gameplay time), and while the combat is rather tame with the lack of depth, balance and variety, as some spells or attacks are more ineffective than others, while you'll find some devastating attacks which will prevent you from varying the way you play, but for it's short storymode it should keep you entertained until you've played through all the sidequests and the main story.\n\nAs for a South Park game, it truly feels like you're watching an actual South Park episode, or even a whole season, at the same time while playing.\n\nAlso, important mention is how the game plays alot like Paper Mario, with ''active turnbased combat'', by which I mean every move you perform requires you to either tap a button, or time a button pressing in order to successfully perform an action.\nThe game also has partners, which all have their own unique abillities and spells, like such as Butters's Professor Chaos transformation (which by the way, is my favourite pick).\n\nHowever, if you have no interest for South Park, or even have a certain disgust for it, you won't be missing out at all if you're not going to buy it.

They generate this fantastic flow that - in one trick - justify the game pretense while engaging the player in it, epic battle throughout fake taverns and parental curfew taken in strides.\n\nWhen the world of 'normal' adult gets involved or when the game brings back some of the series lore along with stalwart tropes, it is far less successful: the veil of pretend falls and what's left is a giddy but dull self-awareness that highlights the least  flattering parts of the game structure.\n\nChief of these is the turn based combat and its place in the progression: it allows for tedious conservatism (same moves all the time) instead of encouraging experimentation with your equipment and with your buddies during encounters. In the same way, the block system has very unreliable sign and feedback; which makes it difficult to use.\n\nBeside that, your mileage may vary: South Park has built several facets during its run and I don't care for the scat humor from the first seasons or the easy lampooning of popular culture icons that recent years have brought.\n\nSome people do and I expect they'll enjoy the game to through and through. I couldn't because what really interests me is the writers harsh tackling of controversial topics or of the darker aspects of the  logic and ecosystem that you'll find in a pack of kids. There's a significant amount of that (along with a nearly invisible touch of social commentary), but the scat and the pop-ref ARE what the last two thirds of the game ride on.\n\nAnd I can't support that choice: it makes the game less of a beast of its own - self contained, designed for the experience - and makes it rely on a bunch of crutches that are offputtingly obvious and ultimately unnecessary.\n\nThe music is awesome though.","April 16, 2014","true","13.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Seriously, though... after 5 full play throughs and acquiring all of the achievements, I can say that I've checked out every nook and cranny of this game. It's genius. For me, the game and gameplay itself is not complicated at all, as there is no real crafting or spellbooks and the kinds of things we've all come to expect in fantasy-themed games. For me rather, it is the script/plot, the characters and the environment that are beyond brilliant. As many other reviewers have noted, you are basically in one long episode of South Park. The humor is crude, the items you find are equal parts filthy and "cute", the farts are deadly, and the snuke is buried deep within the most cavernous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (pun intended) that you can possiby imagine... I can only say that to me the wait for this game was entirely worth it and I hope that we get more SP games or DLC like this.

People may think that is just an overpriced game about fart jokes, but it's way better than that.\n\nIn this epic game, we play as the New Kid, after he and his parents move to South Park, a quiet little mountain town. But there is a reason for this change. The kid has a power, for wich he is wanted by the goverment.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's awesome. We get to freely explore South Park and all its iconic places and see all the characters from the series (and then, there's 16 bit Canada).\n\nThe combat is way better than would be expected in this kind of game. In the early game, you get to choose your class: you can be either a warrior, wizard, thief or jew. Each class has its own attacks. The combat is turn based and very complex, as we learn new attacks and magic moves and... farts.\n\nThe story is also very good. This is just an innocent game by the kids of South Park, based on the "Stick of Truth", but as the game continues a lot of changes are made to the world and there are a lot of plot twists. There are even choices that the player can make!

It feels like a 15 hour long (well, a little less for you if you don't do sidequests, level up or just walk around) episode.\n\nIt has everything you can expect from South Park and more. It parodies almost all RPG games ever created in such an hilarious way, because remember, it IS South Park after all.\n\nHaving explicit +18 content like it should, the PC version doesn't have any censorship which is great because censoring South Park is missing the point of it. Also, it borders the riddiculous so many times it's amazing how they managed to put this whole story together while keeping its humour fresh.\n\nOn the technical side, a few bugs and glitches here and there that hopefully will be fixed with later patches. Nothing too serious, only a few character flickers in the cinematics and sometimes the music won't play, but nothing that breaks the game in any way (maybe some of the immersion, but that being said, reloading the last checkpoint usually helped).\n\nNow, to the most important part on where you should or not buy the game: IS IT WORTH THE $60 PRICETAG? No. Not at all. I expect playing it only once more right now and maybe replaying it at a later date ocassionally just for the laughs. No multiplayer because remember this is a turn based RPG and we wouldn't have it any other way, but that removes a lot from the replayability value and thus the pricetag should be lower. 30 bucks is about right, 1.50 an hour. Maybe even less, like 15 bucks.\n\nBut that shouldn't stop me from recommending this anyway. Because this game is awesome. It feels like a game. It IS a game. And also a 15 hour long South Park episode. And both are worth the time and the cash to enjoy.\n\nI hope they release some DLC with an expansion on the story or something because it still has room for more content.","March 6, 2014","true","26.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone had a huge hand in helping make this game become a reality.  They of course do most of hte voice work, but also it seams they had a say in how the game characters should move and feel when you play.\n\nWhen you start this game you get treated to a great introduction that you will say to yourself...this is definately south park.  All the way down to when you create your character and move them around it will look like a south park cartoon.\n\nThis game impressed me alot, by the care and work done on it.  The humor is outstanding well at least to those that like the south park genre and I am sure even non-fans and those who dont know what south park is will like this title.\n\nAmong other things there is a bit of fan service at places....like being able to see inside for example cartman's closet and see all those things that where from differing eppisodes of the TV show.\n\nI like this game and i do recommend at least a try by anyone who has the money and time to play it.\n\nCombat like other RPG games is kind of turn based at times.....but the interesting part is that they give you ques to do things during this combat...instead of actual turns.\n\nThe rest fo the game features puzzles and over area exploration.  Included inthe game is also the silly internal menu whihc they took the time to make it meaningful.  What i mean by this is....you use a cell phone to manage your equipment and friends and things....the funny part is...there is an in game social network where you can see differing things your friends say about each other or things that you do or dont do.\n\nAll in all I would say this game would delight everyone who tries it.\n\nHowever I am not sure if anyone should let their children of too young an age play this one....due to the fact it does have violence and some harsh language.","November 25, 2014","true","2.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Mostly i do not like RPGs because many of them have a huge imbalance between action, atmosphere, and a good story, but i do appreciate RPGs that deserve it.\n\nI wished this for a long time now, my girlfriend bought it since it was my name day. I did not wish this as a 'game', i thought it might be pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥, i just wanted it for the humour and because it's South Park.\nI loved it so much that i played it 12 hours since she got it for me, with only 3 breaks (kinda small), i know, i know, it's kinda alot.\nI can't talk much about the story, we all know it, i can tell you about it's moral tho, it's about how kids nowadays just stay on facebook all day, and refuse to socialize and play outside, you need to recruite kids to play with, but most of them are 'busy', you are one of the few kids that choose to turn a simple normal stick, into a 'supreme weapon' that can 'control the universe', so basically, it's an RPG in which you are playing an RPG. You and the other kids playing 'The Stick of Truth' had built a world separate from the real world in which kids nowadays don't play anymore, and don't do anything creatively.\nI won't change a single thing in the story, it's so damn perfect, it has that South Park feeling, with alot of humour, that teaches you one more important thing.\n\nThe game itself was done great, the atmosphere is there, you can feel it, you can feel that you are indeed a kid in South Park, Colorado.\nThere might be few minor glitches, you usually can get past them easily, not a big deal.\nWhen i finished it, i felt like cryng, i enjoyed every ♥♥♥♥ing second of it!\n\n\nI would love an open-world South Park MMORPG, i will give you all my monies.\nPS: If you never watched South Park, i suggest you see the whole show from the beginning, there are many things you might not understand if you never watched it.","November 9, 2014","true","17.4"," 21 of 39 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","21","39","0","0"

Not bad at all. The South Park (SP) guys have really done it. They have managed to make a game that looks and plays like a SP episode. The characters are there, the humour is there, the music is there and ofc the raunchiness is there. If you are into SP you will not be disappointed.\n\nSo, you are the new kid - in my case a black Jewish kid with freckles and purple hair - and you just moved into SP. It is your mission to make friends, beat up elves and bums, loot what you can and deal with a fair deal of anal probing. Your charter is customizable up to the balls (no pun intended, you can have balls on your chin) with various clothes, weapons, haircuts, glasses etc. As in most rpg-s you get levels from fighting and questing and upon levelling up your stats go up (you can’t pick which stats) and you unlock more abilities (you can choose perks and you gain magic spells and special abilities that level up). The battle is turn based, but has a quick time event system built into it every step of the way. Oddly enough, I really did not not like it! In fact, the game is pretty solid all around. It’s a good RPG.\n\nTrue RPG fans will ofc be missing the ability to assign your str/agi/int etc and maybe they will expect a larger variety of skills and especially magic (8h in, I find the magic/fart system to be perhaps the most disappointing part of it, but still ok) but you do get to shape how you do your damage so you feel in control all the time.\n\nThe game is well paced, there is always something for you to do, the game world is easy to travel /a bit small maybe even/ so you don’t waste time just travelling. New areas of the world open up as you gain new abilities giving you reasons to go back to places you have visited already.\n\nIf you can take the SP humour, you will never have a dull moment and you will be adventuring with smile on your face the whole time.  This game is fab aside from the lacklustre magic system.\n\n9/10","March 8, 2014","true","15.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And it's not particularly long for an RPG - you can get through the meat of it in around 16 hours without rushing.\n\nHowever, it's great fun. You can explore the entire town of South Park, sifting through shops and houses for items, and as you progress through the main story, you'll unlock new abilities that allow you to reach new areas of familiar locations. Levelling happens very frequently, via two separate systems - one skill tree is unlocked by amassing 'friends' on South Park's pseudo-Facebook (accomplished by completing quests or exploring), and the other is unlocked by gaining XP from combat.\n\nCombat happens very often, whether you're just wandering round the town or engaging in quests. It's turn-based, with you controlling an ally (such as Kenny or Butters) as well as your own character. There are several different damage types, which can multiply each other (for example, if you set an enemy on fire, then farting on them will cause much more damage). Weapons range from throwable tampons to ninja stars to Cartman's "respect-mah-authoritah" truncheon, and you can modify all of them to have additional properties.\n\nPlayer customisation is epic. There is a VAST range of outfits, ranging from SWAT uniforms to Crab People cosplay, all of which give you different perks, and can be customised with different colours and abilities. You can find glue-on facial hair, makeup, wigs, and get a nosejob at Tom's Rhinoplasty to look like David Hasslehoff. And though you can only select a boy (for story reasons), you can get a makeover to pull off a very convincing lady-boy.\n\nGraphics are... South Park. The whole thing's totally seemless, with your character appearing in cutscenes with full outfit customisation, and it does feel like a really long episode of the show. Particularly given that the voices are all accurate (most of them being performed by Trey Parker and Matt Stone anyway, who were intimately involved in the game's development).\n\nWriting's a little bit hit-and-miss. Though you can thoroughly explore the town, meet most of the show's characters and perform sidequests for them, most of these off-piste sections aren't particularly funny, and are more fan service than anything else.\nThe focus of the writing is very clearly in the main story. It's funny, imaginative and shocking, and doesn't *require* you to have a knowledge of the show (though it helps). It doesn't have the rapid-fire succession of inspired random weirdness that made the show great originally, or the cutting satire that's kept it so successful in recent years, but it does have a gargantuan helping of the body humour (toiletry and sexing, basically) that's always been a South Park staple.\n\nLet's put it this way. If you like the idea of slapping Nazi zombie cows with large pink vibrators, or of harnessing the aromatic powers of your colon to subdue gun-toting SWAT agents, stop reading and hit the 'buy' button.","January 12, 2015","true","24.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Lads 'n lassies who love South park show: You must own this game. It's so rare we see a great game licenesed based. What to say about this game?\n\nWell imagenie that one day, you became a SP charecter, right after Season1 7 finale; Kids still playing Dungeon and Dragons combined with Game of Thrones, adults are just same dumbarses they usually are in show, and ones again a great danger rise (or should i say decent) upon quiet little mountien town. Telling more -- would be revealing spoilers, and that would be a crime. I will just say that: Playing Stick of Truth is like watching another 3-5 episodes of South park.\n\nThere are a lot of content for fans, easter eggs here and there, references, infamous satire.\n\nGameplay itself is solid and will keep you interteined. A mix between JRPG and WRPG, made surprisingly well. Classes, diffrent tactics and combat moves, partners, gear and so on. Nothing that ye haven't seen before or any inovations. But it works.\n\nThe game have flows; It's short (even if you will go crazy and complete all side quests), level cap issue, and if you are not SP fan... you will not get this game. A minor issues here and there, but overall, this is a good game by itself and masterpiece fans deserve!\n\nSo, if you one of those SP fans; gear up, buy a few Cheesy Puffs, tell kitty to go away and remove children and easy to offend people from the monitor. Because South park is a show that no one suppose to watch and game should not be played.

All I can say after playing this game sometime is that it's truly a MUST have for all South Park fans out there! South Park: The Stick of Truth's got to be one of the funniest games I've ever played. It's designed to make you feel like you're watching a regular episode of the show which they have suceeded to do. You can be sure the show's famous childish, religion hating, poop humour's in the game as well. As an RPG- and longtime fan of the show I must say the game is excellent and funny as hell.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TigerXtrm/recommended/213670/","TigerXtrm","TigerXtrm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TigerXtrm/","129 products in account","This game is not a shabby game adaption of a succesful franchice that completely fails like any other game adaption. This is a game that was written, designed and developed by the original South Park creators. Including original voices and all the trademark (dark) humor the TV show has become famous for.\n\nBecause of this, South Park: The Stick of Truth feels like you are watching a feature length South Park movie. Everything is just there. The characters are spot on. The voices are spot on and the storyline is traditionally 'wtf am I watching' good/fun. Even when you're actively controlling your character the world around you feels 'real'.\n\nYou play as 'the new kid' who's parents moved to South Park after some incident involving you. And as you go out to make friends you run into the South Park cast who are in the middle of a very very serious role playing game involving humans vs the elves. The role playing game mechanics the children have made up is translated into gameplay mechanics. Foods are health potions, energy drinks are power potions and anything that gives you serious gas are mana potions.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly fun, though also fairly limited. You are free to explore South Park as much as you wish and interact with its inhabitants. Meanwhile you can raid their houses and garages for items and potions without consequence. The world is fairly interactable. Often you are able to shoot things or break things outside of combat. Sometimes leading to taking out enemies before a fight actually starts. This is a good thing because the fights tend to get boring fast.\n\nFighting occurs when enemies tag you during exploration. You can also tag them first, whoever lands the first blow gets to take the first turn during the combat phase. The combat mechanics themselves center around turn based combat. You and one compantion have to battle up to six enemies at a time. During a turn you may consume an item to give you a bonus and perform one attack. When all enemies are defeated the fight is won and you go back to exploration.\n\nThe fighting mechanics work and are fun. But they are only fun for so long. Especially in the beginning you are regularly jumped by enemies who force you into a fight. For me this started to get annoying because I just wanted to get to my next objective, not do all kinds of random fighting. Later in the game this becomes increasingly frustrating because fights become more frequent and enemies become harder to beat and/or appear in larger numbers.\n\nThe actual attacks are also confusing. There is a whole range of buttons and combos to use various attacks, but none of them seem to make any sense. One sword requires a left click, another sword requires a right click. The 'spells' are taught to you through a complicated 'find the right frequency' tutorial but this is never applied again during actual fights. Blocking enemies can get tedious and frustrating. The game will indicate when you need to block, but this turns out to be highly inaccurate. There is also the use of shields and armor which are apparently two different things but are never properly explained. A lot of fighting mechanics are just thrown at you and you are left to figure out how they work on your own.\n\nAll in all this is a very good game. True to the TV show and fairly ok gameplay to boot. But this being South Park, be prepared for some extremely weird and grotesque scenes. From visuals of anal probing to Nazi zombie fetuses (including swastikas) that spew various Adolf Hitler soundbites at you. If you think you know what to expect from South Park, be prepared to see them push the limits of the acceptable.\n\nRecommended to get this game on or off sale. It's worth full price if you ask me.","July 1, 2014","true","13.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It pays the perfect amount of tribute to classic and new episodes alike while creating an experience and story that is unique, much like any other thing Trey and Matt have produced. The gameplay is indeed simple, a classic turn-based RPG, but still incredibly fun. Everything from your equipment to your abilities and enemies are truly fantastically designed to fit right into the South Park universe, and there are a lot of hilarious enemies and boss battles that all seem to keep the game different as you continue to play through it. While I haven't beaten the game just yet, I have heard it is a bit on the short side, but with the great mix of fun gameplay, hilarious comedy, amazing story-telling by Matt and Trey(as usual), I think it's well worth the price tag. Plus the town of South Park is chock full of fun places to explore with even the "junk" items you find lying around being little easter eggs for both longtime and newer fans of the show. I totally recommend this game for any fans of the show, or even anyone who is just curious what it's all about, as it is a perfect snapshot of the genious comedic minds of Matt Stone and Trey Parker.","March 5, 2014","true","15.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

My only complaint is the fact that the storyline and game is VERY short. I picked up the game on sale and only played every couple of days for a few hours max, and beat the game in under 20 hours... And no, I didn't only complete the main story missions. I collected everything I could find and did tons of side quests for friends and just to extend the game. I belive the $30+ reguar price would be more justifed with some cheap DLC packs for extra missions (they wont make DLC for free...). Don't get me wrong, the voice acting and humor is exactly what you see on TV, this is basically a playable South Park episode. I just wish they added some more missions/quests to keep me coming back....\n\nTLDR; Get the game on sale. You can beat the entire game in under a day so try to limit yourself to a couple hours at a time to maximze playtime. If you are a South Park fan you will enjoy the game.","April 13, 2015","true","19.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

No spoilers, but if you decide to play this game, be prepared to see some epic ♥♥♥♥.\n+An open world with a main quest and numerous side quests\n+Almost every character from South Park makes an appearance, or is at least mentioned - even single episode characters like Damien, Gazunga and the Woodland Christmas Critters.\n+A multitude of outfits and a nice stockpile of weapons\n+Makes fun of many video game cliches\n\nAnd on the negative side:\n\n-No Russell Crowe :(  (maybe there'll be a 'Fighting Around the World' DLC?)\n-The main quest is completely linear and kind of shortish.\n-The level cap is rather low. In fact, it's so low, you're sure to hit it before you finish the MQ even if you're avoiding all of the side ones.\n\nOverall: You probably heard this 100 times before, but if you're a fan of the show, or are simply looking for a game that doesn't treat itself too seriously, you'll (probably) love The Stick of Truth.\nProtip - if the Steam price is too steep for you, you'll probably get a better deal at your local retailer.

A bit over-hyped and hard to avoid spoilers. Best served with no previous review consumption.\n\nGame mechanics are OK, although the end game is driven by story not the mechanics since you can easily become a bit overpowered and each battle can be won by the same moves over and over again, accordingly the beginning of the game is a bit slow paste and story begins to shine after maybe 6 hours (or less) of game play depending on how active you'll be with the exploring and side quests.\n\nSide quest count is really low and most of them can be completed and accessed early on in the game. There's little value for playing it few times and content will cover around 12 hours.\n\nWhen it comes to censored scenes by Ubisoft - realistically there was just two scenes where I though that it could't be shown on TV. If you think otherwise - watch south park few seasons back. Again, it's bit over-talked and over-hyped, it's not that bad and could go further in some cases.\n\nAll in all - it's a fun trip for the south park fans and good standing grounds for future releases.

While playing the game you feel like you’re watching an entire season of South Park which stars you. The game’s presentation is outstanding from the voice acting, to the animation style, to the music. The game is laugh out loud funny. However, if you’re easily offended it’s best to stay clear. The humor is shocking, crude, and insulting the way it’s meant to be.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes it’s a turn based RPG like super Mario All-stars where you have to time your attacks and blocks with a button press. There are four classes to choose from expect the standard three classes (fighter, mage, thief) and the south park exclusive Jew class. The actual RPG elements are pretty simple but with the south park flair. For example, all the health potions and consumables are items from the show like cheesy poofs. There is also some small customization you can do with weapon and armor patches that give certain stats. While the RPG elements are light it’s simply a joy just to see the south park flair on certain attacks and summons. For example, you can summon Jesus to do your bidding, turn into professor Chaos to wreck your enemies, or watch how Cartman does a fire attack.\n\nThere are a ton of references and hidden Easter eggs in this game. Almost every major character from the show makes an appearance in some way. It was simply fun just exploring the town and seeing what people had in their houses.\nThe one downside is that the game is a little on the short side. It’s about 15 hours long if you do all the side quests as well. However, there is no grinding in this game to fill the time. Not once while I was playing did I get bored.\n\nIf you’re a fan of the show definitely pick this game up. It’s worth your time and your money. The creators of South Park and Obsidian Entertainment have possibly made the best licensed game besides the excellent Batman Arkham games.\n","March 10, 2014","true","20.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's a decent sized quest, around 17hrs to finish everything.  The game reminds me of the fantastic Super Mario RPG series.  The game is set in a cartoon world and has simple yet engaging battle mechanics and there's some solid humor to the game. However, I have a feeling this game will not be fondly remembered in the years to come. A lot of the jokes are rehashes and sometimes not even really jokes, but more just references to various different OLD episodes. There are some really funny new villains to battle. The game is really easy. After the first real boss battle, there wasn't any challenge to any of the battles afterwards. The character becomes so over powered.  Another thing that annoyed me was something that's been dragging the show down too is the product placement. A certain famous diarrheatorium is prominently featured in the plot and it's weak that I'm paying out money just be shown commercials. The game is rough around the edges, but there's obviously a lot of talent that went into making the game, but the sense I come away with strongest from the game is that it just feels like wasted potential.

Categories are gameplay, game mechanics, graphics, aesthetics, plotline, and price. Rating is 9/10. It's worth the $59.99, especially when you consider the crappy EA Battlefield, terrible EA Sports games, and awful Activision Call of Duty (which are released at full price when in reality they are worth like $15 at most with no sale at release). If you're not familiar with South Park, go to SouthParkStudios.com and watch a few recent recent episodes for free (and legally). Then come back and play the game. All in all, get this game.\n\nIf you like South Park, then you will like this game. In case you haven't heard, this game gets offensive and totally inappropriate in all the best ways. Definitely NOT for children, because it's inappropriate for them, and they wouldn't even get why most of this insanity is actually funny. A good overall concept to approach this game with is that you are a character on the show during one of the episodes.\n\nI rate this game 8/10. 5 star rating is for games like Dead Island, Killing Floor, Strike Suit Zero, and Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine. 10 star is for Stanley Parable, Terraria, Saints Row IV, Batman Arkham City. And the 11/10 is reserved for the likes of Kerbal Space Program, Starbound, and Fallout: New Vegas.\n\nThe game play is basically a bit of exploration, quests, and battles. The exploration aspect is average, does get a bit tiresome to have to find a fast travel point. Personally, as a fan of the show, it was interesting to walk around the town and really get a feel for the layout. The hidden items do require some thinking and memory, which is refreshing break from the usual "Oh great I found that collectible right in front of that huge blinking arrow." The quests are engaging; both the main quests and side quests. This relates to the story of the game, which is discussed below.\n\nThe game mechanics for battle are simple yet solid, and is the main drawback of the game. That is to say, the gameplay is great but not awesome. It's basically a slightly evolved version of what Final Fantasy on the NES and SNES used, basically with the addition of timing your attacks and blocks for extra damage. This is the mechanic used battle after battle, and can get a little stale if you don't acquire new gear, or if you are hung up on a particular battle. Played on Normal, the battles are challenging enough, which helps the battles from feeling repetitve. The addition of new moves and different buddies also helps.\n\nThe graphics are great. Everything is clear, and there is minimal compression noise. I, personally, would have preferred an entirely uncompressed game (or perhaps a DLC option like Skyrim offered), but I realize that not everyone wants to spend a good amount (aka, too much) money on their computer, so no fault here.\n\nThe aesthetics are standard South Park, which means they are amazing. The movements are both crappy and intricate. Color choices are from a limited palate, yet are are used deftly. Broad-stroked, yet detailed. Watch a newer episode, and you'll perfectly understand the well-executed aesthetics of this game. I actually would say that this game has more overall visual things happening than any 1 episode.\n\nThe plotline and storytelling of this game is where Stick of Truth really shines through. The voice acting is brilliant, as per usual South Park. As for the writing (as in, if you were going to sit down and read a transcription) is great. For fans of the show, the writing is more Black Friday S17E7 and less Margaritaville S13E3. But that's not why we're here. The insanity is way, WAY off the charts... and that indeed is what we want. I will not divulge any of that here, because you really should just experience it by playing the game. Actually, reviewing this game without mentioning all the spoilers and insanity IS a bit tricky, because as you can imagine it's a pretty large part of this game. And what a great part it is.\n\nA good way to approach this game is as a new character on the show. That is to say, if you are looking for a super serious RPG and can't take a joke, this would not be the game for you. If you're looking for a good time, this is your stop.\n\nIs it worth $59.99 (which is the release price)? Hard to say, really. I think in order to answer this question, you have to consider this game as multifaceted: as an object internally to the company that made it (so you don't support a terrible company like EA), you have to consider the game itself (is it just fanservice, or is it actually a decent game), the game as it compares to other games, and for a game based on a TV show, is it enjoyable to only fans or to everyone?\n\nNo way is it worth $59.99: "South Park Studios has enough freaking money. What they did in the past is great, but that was then and this is now. The company doesn't actually matter, all that matters is what I'm getting for my money right now." <-- I personally don't gree with this mentality, so I couldn't really extrapolate on it. However, it wouldn't be fair to leave it out. I would say that you have to vote with yout votes and your money. Don't support ♥♥♥♥♥♥ companies and their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ products. We deserve better, not just whatever turd they want to feed us.\n\nYes, it's worth $59.99 (which is my opinion): South Park Studios is a generally great company. They really do make fun of anyone, and do it to such a degree that it supports our freedom of speech. They have come far on the sweat of their own brow. So then, no qualms with the company. As it is, it's a really well executed "give the player an interactive experience of an episode," and the best one I've come across, ever. The battle mechanics are easy to approach, and the story, humor, and acting is top notch.\n\nFinally, consider all the other games that are priced at $59.99: EA sport games (e.g. Fifa and Madden) and Activision's Call of Duty series, are essentially re-skins of the same game. I'm not going to get into it now, but these games are worth about $15 at release date as they are essentially weapon and map packs. Also consider that Oblivion, Skyrim, New Vegas, Starcraft, Dota, Rust, Dayz, and more are released for less than $60. What I'm getting at is: it takes a game of rare form to really warrant a full price release at $60. EA and Activision games are NO WHERE NEAR THAT MARK. Aka, PLEASE STOP BUYING THESE CRAPPY GAMES AT FULL PRICE. End rant.\n\nSouth Park, I believe, hits that mark. Not one thing in this entire game can be labeled "bad" or "needs work." Considering this, I hope this game is a proof of concept, as I would absolutely love to see more interactive episodes like this. If you ever buy a game for $59.99, this might be it.\n\nFinally, if you are not familiar with the show, you should go to SouthParkStudios and watch a few of the recent ones. It's totally free, and totally legal. Personally, as a fan of the show, I would recommend you start from S1E1 and go all the way forward if you've never seen the show. Firstly to get all the jokes in the game, and secondly because you can really see the development of the techniques, characters, writing, and equipment they use. Seeing the show as well as the studio through the episodes is worth the watch.\n\nSooooo yeah. Review done. Get this game.","March 7, 2014","true","18.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

South Park: The Stick of Truth is one of those rare occasions. A great role-playing game made by Obsidian Entertainment (creators of Fallout: New Vegas) along with the creators of South Park (who also do a lot of the voice acting) to create a funny and simple game in which to celebrate the world of South Park and also to give fans something to enjoy for years to come. While relatively short by most role-playing game standards, lasting between 15-18 hours, The Stick of Truth gives enough variety and plenty of humor to make it an easily enjoyable experience and worth the asking price. Everything in the game is wholly belonging to South Park, it has songs from episodes dotted throughout the game, voice actors make a return to voice their respective characters and everything feels like South Park. Visuals also feel directly translated from the show, the game feels like a very long episode of the show. Controls are simple and easy to learn, the game overall is pretty easy with only a few enemies posing a decent challenge so you won’t feel very much pressure from the combat portion of the game. The only real detriment to South Park: The Stick of Truth is the fact that it is everything South Park. While I personally find the game to be funny and enjoy the jokes, it is easy to see how this game can turn away those who aren’t huge fans or hate the humor that South Park has and there isn’t an amazing enough role-playing game here to win those on the fence about South Park over. The other minor gripe with the game is the controls when using the mouse and keyboards. Some of the abilities didn’t feel like they responded as well when using their respective keys versus a controller. I also experience a few glitches such as Jimmy not getting out of his stuttering loop and some minor glitches of my character flickering in and out of a scene during a cinematic.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my time with South Park: The Stick of Truth, there is a fun role-playing game here along with the great humor of South Park. Those who won’t enjoy this game are those who are going to be offended by what is displayed in the game or just don’t enjoy the humor of South Park. If you are middle of the ground and don’t mind the humor the role-playing game beneath may not be enough to warrant a full $60.00 USD price tag.\n\n-Thumbs Up from Royial\n\nVideo Review: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork","March 10, 2014","true","35.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

All I can say after playing this game sometime is that it's truly a MUST have for all South Park fans out there! South Park: The Stick of Truth's got to be one of the funniest games I've ever played. It's designed to make you feel like you're watching a regular episode of the show which they have suceeded to do. You can be sure the show's famous childish, religion hating, poop humour's in the game as well. As an RPG- and longtime fan of the show I must say the game is excellent and funny as hell. I've started crying from laughter several times. Nonetheless, this game's genius and if you're either a fan of the show or you enjoy playing RPG games (even though this game's not a serious one) this is definitely a game for you!","March 7, 2014","true","20.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altoryu/recommended/213670/","altoryu","Altoryu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altoryu/","126 products in account","The main thing to know about this game is it is very faithful to the TV show as a whole, though that should be a given since the game's story was written by South Park's creators. It is pretty much inserting yourself into the world of South Park, interacting with the world and its characters in fun and humorous ways.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't that bad either, anyone familar with the battle systems of games like Paper Mario will adapt quick to this and its easy enough to pick up even if you haven't. However one thing I will criticise the game for is the lack of depth for character progression, your max level caps out at 15 and given how much you can progress your abilities, a max level of 25 I feel would have been better suited.\n\nAside from that, there are a lot of weird and wonderful weapons that you can acquire during the game from Darts to dodgeballs to vibrating ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Also many costume pieces can be found, each with their own passives attached such as extra armor or a boost in fire damage.\n\nThese pieces can be customised further through the use of 'Strap-ons' to give extra benefits like causing bleeding, giving more armor and even recovering hp and pp on perfect attacks.\n\nThe game provides choices in the game but really they do little to effect the game's story, just more something you will do for achievements and choosing who you will fight later on until a point where the two sides merge.\n\nAlso hope you like references, cause the game is full of them from the show such as the 30 Chimpokomon you can collect during the course of the game to well known references from the show.\n\nAs for those who will be affected by the censorship the game's makers put in, I found they don't really do much to spoil anything, just two minigames though I think some audio dialogue in the second half of the game (least in the Australian version) is cut out as well, or just my sound card ♥♥♥♥ing sucks, either or which.\n\nAll in all it's a solid rpg for those interested and also a game for diehard fans of South Park to enjoy, however I would suggest avoiding it if you are the sort of person easily offended by the style of crude humor shows like South Park provide.","March 31, 2014","true","17.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm not a huge turn based RPG player, but I picked up the game with skepticism because I'd heard good things about it and it's South Park.\n\nThe game is funny and engaging. It has a lot to do and I found myself spending entire afternoons and evenings playing this game (which I don't do very often). As I walked around South Park doing side quests I found myself laughing at the dialogue of people I passed by or my buddy when I did certain things or went certain places. There are so many Easter Eggs in this game that you can find while walking around looting (Butters' Creamy Goo and Chinpokomon to name a couple) and a lot of them are cleverly placed.\n\nSouth Park: The Stick of Truth is a fantastic turn-based RPG and doesn't disappoint. The game feels like a very long episode of South Park and it actually looks like one too.

One of the things I was nicely surprised by was the length of the game itself, playing through the main story took me about 22 hours, and there's lots of replayability if you want to play through as one of four playable classes.\n\nThe story is brilliant, with so many nods and references to the show that fans will enjoy and a lot. A lot of clever references to other video games, one of the biggest being you playing as a mute protagonist. The gameplay is fantastic, the combat system is fantastic, the animations, the humour... I have to say after playing it, I've fallen in love with this game. You should buy it.","January 5, 2015","true","21.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While playing the game you feel like you’re watching an entire season of South Park which stars you. The game’s presentation is outstanding from the voice acting, to the animation style, to the music. The game is laugh out loud funny. However, if you’re easily offended it’s best to stay clear. The humor is shocking, crude, and insulting the way it’s meant to be.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes it’s a turn based RPG like super Mario All-stars where you have to time your attacks and blocks with a button press. There are four classes to choose from expect the standard three classes (fighter, mage, thief) and the south park exclusive Jew class. The actual RPG elements are pretty simple but with the south park flair. For example, all the health potions and consumables are items from the show like cheesy poofs. There is also some small customization you can do with weapon and armor patches that give certain stats. While the RPG elements are light it’s simply a joy just to see the south park flair on certain attacks and summons. For example, you can summon Jesus to do your bidding, turn into professor Chaos to wreck your enemies, or watch how Cartman does a fire attack.\n\nThere are a ton of references and hidden Easter eggs in this game. Almost every major character from the show makes an appearance in some way. It was simply fun just exploring the town and seeing what people had in their houses.\nThe one downside is that the game is a little on the short side. It’s about 15 hours long if you do all the side quests as well. However, there is no grinding in this game to fill the time. Not once while I was playing did I get bored.\n\nIf you’re a fan of the show definitely pick this game up. It’s worth your time and your money. The creators of South Park and Obsidian Entertainment have possibly made the best licensed game besides the excellent Batman Arkham games.\n","March 10, 2014","true","20.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's a decent sized quest, around 17hrs to finish everything.  The game reminds me of the fantastic Super Mario RPG series.  The game is set in a cartoon world and has simple yet engaging battle mechanics and there's some solid humor to the game. However, I have a feeling this game will not be fondly remembered in the years to come. A lot of the jokes are rehashes and sometimes not even really jokes, but more just references to various different OLD episodes. There are some really funny new villains to battle. The game is really easy. After the first real boss battle, there wasn't any challenge to any of the battles afterwards. The character becomes so over powered.  Another thing that annoyed me was something that's been dragging the show down too is the product placement. A certain famous diarrheatorium is prominently featured in the plot and it's weak that I'm paying out money just be shown commercials. The game is rough around the edges, but there's obviously a lot of talent that went into making the game, but the sense I come away with strongest from the game is that it just feels like wasted potential. It could've been great and it ended up decent.","March 24, 2014","true","19.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

No spoilers, but if you decide to play this game, be prepared to see some epic ♥♥♥♥.\n+An open world with a main quest and numerous side quests\n+Almost every character from South Park makes an appearance, or is at least mentioned - even single episode characters like Damien, Gazunga and the Woodland Christmas Critters.\n+A multitude of outfits and a nice stockpile of weapons\n+Makes fun of many video game cliches\n\nAnd on the negative side:\n\n-No Russell Crowe :(  (maybe there'll be a 'Fighting Around the World' DLC?)\n-The main quest is completely linear and kind of shortish.\n-The level cap is rather low. In fact, it's so low, you're sure to hit it before you finish the MQ even if you're avoiding all of the side ones.\n\nOverall: You probably heard this 100 times before, but if you're a fan of the show, or are simply looking for a game that doesn't treat itself too seriously, you'll (probably) love The Stick of Truth.\nProtip - if the Steam price is too steep for you, you'll probably get a better deal at your local retailer.

YOU'LL LOVE EVERY SECOND OF THIS GAME.\n\nYou also wanna know why? Well, okay... dialogues are AWESOME, the story is practically a huge interactive episode of South Park, it's full of easter eggs, references and little details about all the things you loved most in the show. I really don't want to spoiler anything but trust me, it's great. Gameplay wise The Stick of Truth is a fairly simple JRPG, if I had to say something I didn't like is that the game is a little too easy, so you don't have time to use all the party members unless you farm certain enemies at a particular point of the game. But let's be honest, you don't play a South Park game for the RPG mechanics (which aren't bad by the way, the game is fun to play), you play it for the story and the dialogues, and those things are GREAT.\n\nA lot of achievements, collectibles, excellent player customization, good replayability, the whole package.

I'm not a huge turn based RPG player, but I picked up the game with skepticism because I'd heard good things about it and it's South Park.\n\nThe game is funny and engaging. It has a lot to do and I found myself spending entire afternoons and evenings playing this game (which I don't do very often). As I walked around South Park doing side quests I found myself laughing at the dialogue of people I passed by or my buddy when I did certain things or went certain places. There are so many Easter Eggs in this game that you can find while walking around looting (Butters' Creamy Goo and Chinpokomon to name a couple) and a lot of them are cleverly placed.\n\nSouth Park: The Stick of Truth is a fantastic turn-based RPG and doesn't disappoint. The game feels like a very long episode of South Park and it actually looks like one too.

Not only is this licensed game functioning and playable, it's actually good. No, it's more than good. It's brilliant. The gameplay and world fits the South Park license so well and as a long time fan of the series, I've nothing but praise for this game.\n\nWhen I first heard about Stick of Truth, I wasn't too excited. Licensed Games weren't exactly high art and I wasn't a fan of the Lord of the Rings setting because the only South Park episode with that setting I really liked was Return of the Fellowship of The Ring. But when more information came out about it, it slowly began to win me over. This wasn't this setting. It was a parody. It was still the characters and universe that we knew and loved, but using the LoTR settings as a tounge and cheek joke and it honestly worked in my eyes.\n\nThe gameplay really does fit the South Park setting with it being totally in 2D and it also helps brings fun to the turn based fighting in the game. In most RPGs you just hit your attack, and then wait to dodge your enemies attack. In Stick of Truth, they've added a mechanic where you need to time your attack to get maximum damage out of it as well as other variables, such as archers, multiple hit enemies, shields, and more. It really works to help keep the game out of repetive areas in my opinion.\n\nThe graphical style is of course the same that's been featured in the show. Normally, you'd be thinking "lol how could a 2013 game have these graphics". But considering the art style and joke about the South Park style, I find the graphics very charming, and helping add to the feel of the SP universe.\n\nOn top of that the game is absolutely filled to the brim with nothing but in-jokes, references, and more to the most popular and even the least popular episodes of the series. Little things like finding the Gamesphere from Towelie's episode, or finding Butters' The Poop That Took a Pee book, or even finding a certain character inside Stan's closet who refuses to come out. This game is a love letter to South Park fans everywhere, and if you are a South Park fan, this game is an absolute must buy. There is so much love put into this game to make it a game that caters to the South Park fans.\n\nAs for non-fans, I would suggest maybe watching a few episodes of the series before deciding to jump onto the game because the humor is very much like South Park's actual series, so unless you think you'll really love the gameplay element, I think you should see if the show's humor interests you beforehand before you decide to get this game. But in my own opinion, South Park The Stick of Truth is a excellent game, and shows that when developers put actual effort in, they can make a truly special game for TV Shows.","November 27, 2015","true","6.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rfry11/recommended/213670/","rfry11","Cook that white Bernie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rfry11/","501 products in account","This is the greatest South Park game of all time. In its own right, this is a pretty great adventure/JRPG hybrid. Although every game mechanic has been used hundreds of times in every game, they've never been combined in such a way like this before. A JRPG with a full collect-a-thon system set in South Park, CO? That's a huge undertaking, and Obsidian have stepped up to the plate.\n\nThe game is also relatively bug free, although its menus and interface look like ♥♥♥. I have to assume that they did not have an interface designer, because the interface is both ugly and hard to use. Luckily, it's not too important, and beyond that the game is quite beautiful in its own South Park way.\n\nThe biggest selling point of this game is the ability to play the game and have a hard time finding graphical inconsistencies that make it seem like you're not just watching an episode of South Park. This is a long, 15-hour episode of South Park, and it is pretty fantastic.\n\nHowever, do not buy the DLC. I picked them both up, and never used the equipment and items provided by the DLC.","June 15, 2014","true","17.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It harkens back to classic RPGs while still having a free-roam style feel. Also has various nerd references to Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, and other medieval fantasy realms. As well, of course, the many references to classic south park episodes that make you chuckle. Walk around and fart on people and see their reaction. Rummage through the town for money or items to sell and buy new gear and such.\n\nIf you love South Park, do yourself a favor and buy this game. and hour+ into it and I'm already loving every minute.\n\nI do not have much criticism on the game yet. Sure, there are always things people want to see change. I have not spotted too many issues or anything yet. But then again, I'm no critic. I simply speak as a South Park and Stone/Parker fan when I say congratulations to them for making a fun and truely fantastic RPG.

I have just finished it and I'm honestly stunned at just how good it was, I was expecting it to be good but not this good. I am left with that "I've just experienced something special" feeling that I'm rarely left with after finishing a game. I have to say the last few hours of the game were some of the most enjoyable I've ever experienced, they really turned it up to 11 towards the end.\n\nIf you're a fan of South Park you know the type of humour to expect and The Stick of Truth is South Park at its absolute best, the writing is huge reason as to why it's so amazing. I have never laughed so much while playing a game, every time you thought it couldn't get funnier or more ludicrous it did, some of the stuff they have you do is beyond offensive and I absolutely loved every minute of it. Looking past what you'd expect from a South Park there's also a decent turn based RPG underneath, the combat felt great if not a little unbalanced and easy (I highly suggest playing on hardcore) but there were some really tough fights a long the way, surprisingly not the last one which I one shot, though. Overall the gameplay was solid and didn't hurt the game whatsoever but it could definitely be improved upon for the sequel. I honestly think even if you've never watched South Park you can fully enjoy this game, assuming you have a good sense of humour and aren't offended easily (or at all in some cases).\n\nWhether you're a South Park fan or not I highly recommend this game as it's an absolute blast to play that will have you howling like a loon every 10 minutes!","January 6","true","19.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tristanmike/recommended/213670/","tristanmike","TristanMike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tristanmike/","909 products in account","An absolute must play for any fan of South Park. Completely written and voiced by Trey and Matt (along with other cast members) comes a South Park experience that fans have been waiting for after several games of less than stellar quality. It is so well done that there is a real, likely chance someone will walk in the room and ask what episode you are watching. Hats off to Obsidian and Trey/Matt for really nailing the look and the feel of the show in an interactive game.\n\nThe story, much like the show, is rather absurd, crude and all around ridiculous, chalked full of classic (and possibly forgotten about) references. You are the 'New Kid' who has just moved to South Park and you start to befriend the various characters while becomming embroiled in a dangerous, enternal struggle for The Stick of Truth. There are so many great characters that show up and some that had slipped my mind completely. There was one character I was really hoping to see and didn't, but I won't spoil it on anyone.\n\nCombat is a pretty basic turn based combat system, much like JRPG's of old with a few more interactive elements thrown in. Admittedly it is rather basic and shallow, but I feel that it serves to keep the story moving along rather than having the player getting bogged down by combat.\n\nIn the end, I think it's best to play this game simply to enjoy the story for the laughs.","March 21","true","45.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NinjahTurtle/recommended/213670/","NinjahTurtle","Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NinjahTurtle/","147 products in account","General Idea If you enjoy the show South Park, then you will enjoy this game! That being said, if you don't like the show, then you probably won't enjoy this game, as it is basically a 16 hour playable episode.\n\nGameplay This game is absolutely hilarious! What you see in the TV show is pretty much what you can expect to see in this game. You can go into most buildings and houses.  In some houses that you try to enter, you will find people masturbating, people screwing horses, or naked dancing ladies.  You can raid people's houses of all their personal belongings and valuables, and nobody gives a damn. The only authority to you really is your parents,  and in one mission a hall monitor, but they don't really count.  There is a point at the beginning of the game when you realize that a fart is bound to the right mouse button. It is at that moment that you will realize what kind of game this is. You probably will love it from this moment on, as most players probably did. The missions are intriguing, and humor is scattered throughout the game everywhere. The one thing people may not like is the combat style. It is a turn-based combat sort of like the game Wizard101. This game is pretty much a single player RPG. You do missions and fight to get experience and level up. As you gain Facebook friends with the people throughout South Park, you will be able to upgrade your player.\n\nLevels I will start by saying that the max level in this game is level 15. It is like many other RPGs, in that all items have a level requirement. I must say, in my opinion, that it takes a while to level up. In just about 9 hours of gameplay, I have only gotten to level 13. Based on this, it probably takes between 10-12 hours to get to level 15 and complete one of the classes.\n\nCampaign You start the campaign as the new kid who just moved to South Park, CO and the hope is that you will help the humans secure the Stick of Truth so that they can rule the universe. The war is between the Humans, led by Cartman, and the Elves, led by Kyle. There are 4 different classes you can choose to be, and they are:  Fighter, Mage, Thief,  and  Jew.   You are able to type a name in at the beginning of the game, but you are assigned the name "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥" by Cartman.  The campaign is very fun and immersive, and you could easily find yourself sitting and playing this game for hours at a time. You will find out that it can be very hard to get up and stop playing this game. After you complete the campaign, however, there is nearly no drive to keep playing the game.\n\nConclusion In my opinoin, every penny I put into this game has been worth it, because I purchased it when it was only $13.59. If you like South Park, and the game is on sale, do not pass it up! Since I don't watch the show very much because I never got into it, I actually only bought it because it was on sale. Once I installed it and played it I soon realized that it was a great purchase! While it is at its normal price of $40, it's really up to you whether or not you want to get it, but it is a fantastic game and you probably will come close to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your pants because it is so funny. This game is definitely in my Top 5 favorites, and I completely recommend this game!\n\nThank you for reading my review of South Park™: The Stick of Truth™","January 2, 2015","true","12.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Has simple RPG elements and getting the grasp of things, and the freedom to explore soon into the game is rewarding. It isn't basic to the point of being boring, and it isn't overbearingly difficult. Fans of the show will feel right at home, but if you're someone who hasn't watched it, it is still a blast to play. Best played alone, because certain scenes are too raunchy and difficult to explain to others watching you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rfry11/recommended/213670/","rfry11","Cook that white Bernie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rfry11/","501 products in account","This is the greatest South Park game of all time. In its own right, this is a pretty great adventure/JRPG hybrid. Although every game mechanic has been used hundreds of times in every game, they've never been combined in such a way like this before. A JRPG with a full collect-a-thon system set in South Park, CO? That's a huge undertaking, and Obsidian have stepped up to the plate.\n\nThe game is also relatively bug free, although its menus and interface look like ♥♥♥. I have to assume that they did not have an interface designer, because the interface is both ugly and hard to use. Luckily, it's not too important, and beyond that the game is quite beautiful in its own South Park way.\n\nThe biggest selling point of this game is the ability to play the game and have a hard time finding graphical inconsistencies that make it seem like you're not just watching an episode of South Park. This is a long, 15-hour episode of South Park, and it is pretty fantastic.\n\nHowever, do not buy the DLC. I picked them both up, and never used the equipment and items provided by the DLC.","June 15, 2014","true","17.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm not a huge turn based RPG player, but I picked up the game with skepticism because I'd heard good things about it and it's South Park.\n\nThe game is funny and engaging. It has a lot to do and I found myself spending entire afternoons and evenings playing this game (which I don't do very often). As I walked around South Park doing side quests I found myself laughing at the dialogue of people I passed by or my buddy when I did certain things or went certain places. There are so many Easter Eggs in this game that you can find while walking around looting (Butters' Creamy Goo and Chinpokomon to name a couple) and a lot of them are cleverly placed.\n\nSouth Park: The Stick of Truth is a fantastic turn-based RPG and doesn't disappoint. The game feels like a very long episode of South Park and it actually looks like one too. I can recommend this to people who have only seen the show a few times and you'll still love it to death. 10/10.","June 26, 2014","true","25.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

For the best and the worst, this game recycles most of the horrible events that happened in South Park over 17+ years. And you will keep thinking "OMG it can't be more shocking than that !" till the next sequence which will feature something even more horrible..! ;-)\nThe only downside is that there's not much true original content story-wise and joke-wise, but in term of fan service, it's hard to beat that, you'll feel like living in the South Park world and it's (nearly) priceless !\n\nThe major downside of the game is the RPG gameplay that is really basic despite a lot of (duplicate) items and gets really repetitive over the course of the adventure. It's not too bad so it's still bearable, but don't expect anything challenging or interesting combat-wise ; you'll get a few good laughs, the 1st couple of times you'll try out the new abilities, though ! :)\n\nPros:- you'll be living in a South Park mini-series !\n- you'll relive most of the dire moments of the series (you know what a dire moment is, right ?)\n- extremely well crafted, with a bunch of good ideas that make exploring the world challenging & interesting\n- the "RPGization" of the South Park world is well-though and work pretty well\n\nCons- RPG comats are very basic ; they're cumbersome at 1st, and repetitive afterwards, and require too much reflexes & QTA\n- about 20-hour of gameplay, which would have been enough if there was more story & jokes and less RPG combat\n- could have used a bit more original content (a lot come from existing episodes ; although they did so much already in the series that it can't be easy to come up with too much fresh ideas :) )\n\nBonus note :- if you haven't played Skyrim, you'll miss out a bunch of the RPG jokes","February 20","true","19.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gabisepol/recommended/213670/","gabisepol","Elle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gabisepol/","87 products in account","BR review, translate it if you want.\nPROS: Jogo sensacional, animações incríveis, vibrantes, diálogos engraçados, história que te prende (você sente que fumou uma droga braba mesmo sem ter feito isso, cenas engraçadas-porém-sem-sentido todo o tempo), oferece a possibilidade de lutar contra inimigos/bosses usando um Buddy (as principais crianças de South Park) e cada inimigo tem um ponto fraco nas lutas; seja fire damage, gross damage etc. Você pode usar um item de cada vez durante o combate: pode usar uma pequena ou grande poção de cura, pode te dar força, atacar novamente, sem contar as Habilidades de cada personagem, cada um tem 3 habilidades especiais e distintas que podem tirar mais vida que um ataque de espada ou arco e flecha se você souber usar corretamente. Pode ir ao banheiro - literalmente - e pegar uma amostra de suas fezes e jogar no inimigo, fazendo-o perder vida com gross damage. Aliás, andando pela cidade, o botão esquerdo bate em alguém e o botão direito peida. Você pode encontrar Jesus no jogo, assim como na série... Uma coisa interessante e necessária neste jogo é que você é capaz de upar, ganha experiência em cada combate que entra (se você perder, o jogo volta pro último checkpoint), sua vida aumenta automaticamente conforme seu nível e você também pode usar armaduras, luvas, capacetes com inúmeras funções (pode escolher um aprimoramento extra em cada vestimenta, junto com as armas).\nCON: Embora tenham tantos pros - citei os que consegui lembrar - não acho que este jogo valha R$80 (brazilian currency), justamente por ser um jogo relativamente curto... Acho que 15 horas jogando é o suficiente para zerar. Mesmo que a história seja tão bem preparada, pelo menos no MEU ponto de vista ainda tem aquela enrolação, o final do game não acabou alcançando minhas expectativas, mas a história em si, durante o jogo, é bem divertida. O pior contra pra mim foi o combate com os inimigos/bosses, eles vêm com quase 40000 de vida, e não se engane achando que vem só um inimigo assim: em todas as batalhas, eles chamam pelo menos 3 amiguinhos pra ajuda-los com uns 8000 de vida, curando um ao outro quando a vida de um diminui e cada um tem uma vez de atacar você e seu Buddy, só depois vocês podem ataca-los, enquanto você tem menos de 8000 de vida (quase chegando no nível máximo, que é lvl 15). Sem contar quase no fim da quest principal que começa a vir personagens zumbis, ou seja, mais fortes, resistentes e o pior de tudo: eles revivem. Um exemplo: você está lá na batalha e mata um ou dois "soldados" do boss, ele simplesmente se cura e revive os dois zumbis com a vida máxima. Acaba sendo decepcionante, perde um pouco da magia porque é irritante e desgastante. Um outro ponto negativo são as conquistas, tem algumas sem noção, como derrotar um tal menino na escola usando Sardas; encontrar Jesus sendo judeu.... Quem além de jogar e se divertir quer ganhar as conquistas, acaba precisando analisa-las lentamente antes para acabar não perdendo nenhuma.","January 28","true","36.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The game visually is exactly the same as the show and on-point at that. The story is completely ridiculous, over the top, and extremely good. You are basically playing a long episode of South Park which is sick af. There seems to be a lack of soundtrack variety, but the soundtracks that are in the game are simply brilliant and are amazing which makes up for the minimal amount found in the game in my opinion. The game is a role-playing game and the RPG elements are surprisingly well thoughtout and very diverse for a game like this. The game is my "Game of the Year of 2014".\n\nTHE FUNNIEST ROLE-PLAYING GAME TO EVER TOUCH THIS EARTH. 10/10","October 23, 2015","true","64.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

You have Portal along with a few other gems here and there that have had competent comedic writers, but for the most part every other game is 10-15 years old borrowed internet humor (see: star wars kid, all your base belongs to us, Leroy Jenkins) or cringeworthy regurgitated memes from the depths of 9gag/Reddit (Borderlands 2).\n\nSouth Park: The Stick of Truth on the other hand has made me laugh quite a bit. If you're a fan of the earlier seasons of the show (season 1-5) like me, then you'll love this game since it includes a lot of the highlighted references throughout the entire game along with other later episodes from the mid 2000's such as Al Gore and Christmas Critters. Best part is, it does not contain any celebrities or product placement that has plagued the show for the past ten years...outside of Taco Bell.\n\nThe game is pretty damn short and linear but everything feels like South Park and it genuinely feels like you're in an episode of the show. Each battle is hilarious, especially the boss battles like with Al Gore and the Underpants Gnomes and the special attacks are icing on the cake, especially Kenny's chance of dying. I wish they did something more like make jabs at other games, the game industry, or game journalist like they do with celebrities or well known people on the show. The game is also pretty easy, but you have an option to make it harder.\n\nGood game and I would recommend it...only when it's on sale though just because of the length of the game. Somewhere between $5-$15. $30 is just not worth it, unless you're a hardcore South Park fan.\n\nAlso, the sequel I'm not too sure about. I think The Coon and the superhero thing that's been going on for almost 8 years was a lowlight of the show. That's my personal opinion, so let's hope the sequel is more in depth and as funny as the original.","March 16","true","31.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

Plays like Mario RPG or Costume Quest, a turn based RPG with timed attack and defense indicators that require button presses to execute.\n\nPicked it up and didn't play anything else until I was finished. It was that good.\n\nThe voice acting is as good as an episode of the show. The plot and dialog was excellent with call backs to various episodes so an avid South Park watcher would definitely enjoy the familiarity of the setting and characters.\n\n\n","March 8","true","21.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have just finished it and I'm honestly stunned at just how good it was, I was expecting it to be good but not this good. I am left with that "I've just experienced something special" feeling that I'm rarely left with after finishing a game. I have to say the last few hours of the game were some of the most enjoyable I've ever experienced, they really turned it up to 11 towards the end.\n\nIf you're a fan of South Park you know the type of humour to expect and The Stick of Truth is South Park at its absolute best, the writing is huge reason as to why it's so amazing. I have never laughed so much while playing a game, every time you thought it couldn't get funnier or more ludicrous it did, some of the stuff they have you do is beyond offensive and I absolutely loved every minute of it. Looking past what you'd expect from a South Park there's also a decent turn based RPG underneath, the combat felt great if not a little unbalanced and easy (I highly suggest playing on hardcore) but there were some really tough fights a long the way, surprisingly not the last one which I one shot, though. Overall the gameplay was solid and didn't hurt the game whatsoever but it could definitely be improved upon for the sequel. I honestly think even if you've never watched South Park you can fully enjoy this game, assuming you have a good sense of humour and aren't offended easily (or at all in some cases).\n\nWhether you're a South Park fan or not I highly recommend this game as it's an absolute blast to play that will have you howling like a loon every 10 minutes!","January 6","true","19.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is a RPG styled game, kinda like Mario and Luigi back in time, you can pick a class to choose between: Fighter, Mage, Thief and Jew.

It's a turn-based RPG, Final Fantasy style. Although pricey, it's very easy on Normal, the map is not huge and the quests are not numerous _ I finished it after 29 hours, getting a little more than half of the achievements. The reason for playing is to enjoy the story. And that's where the game shines.\n\nAs a gigantic "South Park" episode, it's amazing. A no brainer, if you're a fan of the show. A lot of references from the classic episodes. Several fart jokes and other examples of anal obsession. And Canada is mocked. And you can get dire aids (do you know what dire aids means?). I only missed a zombie Saddam Hussein.\n\nI remember playing the first (and abismal) South Park game on Nintendo 64. They've come a long way. I'll probably buy the sequel, when on sale.","June 2","true","29.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At the time it was an amazing show, that made fun of a little current issues and politics. Somewhere over the years it went from funny to overplayed jokes. When this game came out I was very hesitant as I assumed the same overused jokes were going to be repeated. However, it was on sale and a lot of my friends recommended it. Overall, I wasn't dissapointed and while there are some things I would possibly change to make it from good to amazing, it is well worth the money.\n\nYou start off as the new "mute" kid to South Park and are promptly named Douchbag by Cartman. In a turn style action based game, you can choose from different classes of Mage, Warrier, Theif, and of course Jew. You get to dress your character up with different armor and attach bonuses. Special attributes are given, and overall it has decent gameplay. The overall story line is creative, and a huge bonus for me is the characters like Stanley, Kyle, and Cartman giving commentary to certain situations. You even get to give an abortion to a man and fight Nazis! A lot going on here.\n\nThe two things I would probably change in this game that would have improved it greatly is implement crafting. Throughout the game you collect a lot of junk, and other than acheiving a gaming award for your collection, you can't do anything else with it other than sell it. I really wish some of the junk could be crafted to make some weapons or enchantments (patches in this game) to help improve combat.\n\nI would also add the ability to modify your party members. I would have loved several times to give my partner Butters an awesome Axe, or Cartman some better gear. The game says it updates the stats on the armor and weapons as you level up, but it doesn't quite feel the same as hand picking it yourself.\n\nNow, if they made a sequel or prequel to this game and added maybe some form of these compoenents I would buy it in a second. Really love the creativeness that has gone into this game, and hope that they make another one in the future. Would definetly recommend.","April 5","true","26.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

You can expect all the vulgarity and over the top situations that are in the show along with various nods to the show itself like songs such as "love gravy" and "i've got something in my front pocket for you".\n\nMany a number of the main characters make appearences in the game with the most recognizable being available as buddies that fight alongside you. Butters is the first of such allies and features a special attack where he transforms into Professor Chaos.\n\nThe game also features four classes. Mage, fighter, thief and Jew. All with their unique abilities such as the Jew classes "sling of david"\n\nThe game is a short outing with available sidequests, you can expect a playtime without dong any side quests to be around\n12-14 hours. Definately quite short for the genre, though I wouldn't consider it a full fledged rpg.\n\nThe game provides excellent fan service and a true to the show animation and visual presentation.\n\nHighly recommended for die-hard fans of the show.","July 14, 2014","true","19.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The question is: "Does South Park: The Stick of Truth Deserve To Be a Great Game"...?\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnJTWjO9BS4\n\n\nPresentation\n\nSouth Park: The Stick of Truth brought a wondeful experience at almost every hand. Obsidian Entertainment have done a better than Fallout: New Vegas game. South Park: The Stick of Truth delievers the show and more, brought one of the most abrupt stories I've seen so far in "Years", although the story has a weak reputation but has one of the very unexpected moments that you totally....will "never" expect it from the very beginning to the very ending. If you loved the complex story moments of BioShock: Infinite, so there is no reason that you'll never like South Park: The Stick of Truth's unexpected story turning points.\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_qMeoRyjY\n\n\nGameplay\n\nSouth Park: The Stick of Truth is a 2D, Adventure, Comedy, Action, Role-Playing Game and animation game. but I can say a "RPG" game. The Combat System is basically not that difficult to win, It's "One hit from my side, then One hit from your side" (Not always "One hit", depends in, how many your partners fighting in the battle, right now. in a better way, the quantity of your partners and the quantity of your enemies). the combat system doesn't depend in, how skillful you are, it depends in, how good is your weapon. when you attack an enemy by a hit, your attack causes to him damage, maybe...543, 4694....the stronger the weapon, the tougher, faster you are in a battle.\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pMzxREghy0\n\n\nThe World\n\nWell....almost all RPG games have a map, to explore, dig it deeply, kill enemies, start finish every side mission. South Park: The Stick of Truths' map is the same of South Park the show. Intersted in the world of the South Park show? so this is 95% similar to the show's world. the world is brilliantly fascinating. I can say it, "Better than Grand Theft Auto V's world (Although I gave Grand Theft Auto V a 10 out of 10 in my review)" not only Grand Theft Auto but also can be often "developed" as the best world of a game in history. your question is, "why and how can you infer it as a better world", the answer of the question will never can be explained by speaking, convincing, visualising pretty hard, it just can't be. but in short: an alive world, funny people, lack of empty spots.\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl8iw7N5Jto\n\n\nCanada\n\nSouth Park: The Stick of Truth has two worlds, not only the world South Park is found but also Canada is found. Canada is pretty, pretty and pretty fun place to go and have the funniest citizen. South Park: The Stick of Truth's Canada is a 2D or a 3D style (There is no 3D in South Park: The Stick of Truth), but it's a nintendo's old devices games style (8 bit style). there are bears, snakes and wolf to fight which South Park doesn't have. South Park: The Stick of Truth's Canada contains its own music, sounds effects.\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbuVtz7aqnA\n\n\nCharacters\n\nCartman is too funny at the point that doesn't get silly anymore. Butter is stupid at a point that meets its gloriously character.\nKyle is annoying and hated by Cartman and the New Kid (Doughtbag), but after that you'll start changing your opinion about him. Stan is the same as Kyle. Princess Kenny is indescribable. ManBearPig makes the stupidest conflicts on earth Randy is the best character of all time who loves Taco Bell. there are so much more.\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH9dDkQ_tlI\n\n\nThe Verdict\n\nA must-own game, contains, one of the very best funniest characters, settings, story. I couldn't see better characters than South Park: The Stick of Truths' (Couldn't). South Park: The Stick of Truth is one of the best games in "Years" plus the "best" beginning in "Years". South Park: The Stick of Truth is more/better than South Park the show. South Park: The Stick of Truth is yet the best game of 2014, and deserves to be nominated for Game of The Year 2014. If you wanna play a fascinating 15 hours game, so your choice is South Park: The Stick of Truth. Won't forget: from the same developers of Fallout: New Vegas and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II. Definitely, South Park: The Stick of Truth is a MUST-OWN game. Trust me, MUST OWN, BUT IT, RIGHT NOW.\n\nStory: 10/10\nGameplay: 10/10\nGraphics: 9.5/10\nSounds: 9.5/10\nMusic: 10/10\n\n+ Positives\n\n+Wonderful World+Funny+Story is unpredictable+Soft Combat System+Over-Prefect Characters+Doesn't Seem Hard Nor Easy+More Than The Show+Enemies Are Amazing+Perfect Design In Each Hand+Is fun\n\n- Negatives\n\n-Small Size World Compared to "RPG" Game-Lack Explorations of Powerful Weapons\n\nObsidian Entertainment showed us how good they are. South Park: The Stick of Truth has the ability to beat 2014's games and pretend itself as a nominee for Game of The Year 2014. That's not impossible.\n\n9.2/10 Amazing\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u3AyqgqbHw (Warning, Contains Many Spoilers)\n\nRecommended Price: 49.99$\n\nGames Are Similar To It:\nFamily Guy The Video Game (In Maps Design)\n\n","March 6, 2014","true","67.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","4"

I can say straight away, if you don't like the series, then don't get this game, and stop reading.\nI was a little worried about what to expect with this game when I saw the first gameplay videos. A mix of adventure and turnbased combat is a very rare thing to see these days, atleast among the "larger" titles. As soon as the game or rather episode started, my worries disappeared. This is not so much a game,as it is another episode in South Park.\nYou take on the role as the new kid in town, and as you get forced to make friends in the neighbourhood, all sorts of crazy adventures and humorous catastrophes happen. The story is very good and the progression in this, has never been to slow or to fast. I find that in some games the story gets lost in to much gameplay or the gameplay gets ruined by the story. This game seems to keep the balance between gameplay and story very nicely, which I find is very important to a game with so much comedy. This leads me to the main reason to get the game. The amount of profanity, insanity and sexuality mixed in with a nice amount of violence left me laughing out loud more times I can remember. If you like South Park humour the game is certainly required in your game collection.\nThe gameplay is nothing elaborate or even diffecult. You wander around on maps, interacting with items, people or enemies, and move between these maps without any load time. When you encounter an enemy, the game switches to a turnbased combat phase. The combat is fairly straightforward and for each attack there is a combination of mouseclicking and button-mashing to get it to work. Even if you fail in this sorta easy mash-click-buttoning (Which I did plenty of times), you will still damage your enemy, albeit for a smaller amount of damage. The combat sorta has a tactical element with selecting the right attack for the correct enemy and at the same time requiring a bit of skill with that click-button-mashing. The same applies to the enemy attacks, which you can defend yourself from.\nThe graphics and sound are the same as in the series, though there was a part in the game that changed considerably. I wont spoil anything in this review, but I can tell that I liked the retro-feel of it, and in combination with the story it was a little detail that left me smiling and laughing.\nThe game in itself would be 5 out of 5 stars from me. This however leaving out the price of the game and also the replay value. There are some small elements of choice in the game, but none that will make the story change to much. There are some choices with your class, and some choices during the game, none of which really makes that much of an impact on the story, which is my main reason to get the game. I spent 22 hours playing the game and with a price of 40 euros, that is a big price to pay for a game with nearly no replay value. Still, I look at this game as a gem, and 22 hours laughing and smiling, well... I pay around 10 euros to go to the movies, and those only last what? Like 2 hours?","March 18, 2014","true","16.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

It has original voice acting, the same awesome characters we know and love, and a huge repertoire of jokes that will never cease to surprise you.\n\nThe gameplay itself is played as an open world RPG with turn based battles. The battle itself is actually very good in RPG way, simple enough for anybody to understand it, and hillarious at the same time. We can talk about an "open world" here. But this open world is pretty 2D, which of course matches perfectly the game, and the show. Also South park was recreated in incredible detail, and everything will instantly feel familiar.\n\nFor the fans of the show: It's a must have! Absolutely.

Shock humor doesn't tend to offend me, I just usually don't find it that funny.  Moreover, Trey and Matt's middle finger to the world, everything is equally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t" social and political commentary can be grating; it is both intellectually shallow and safe.  Having said that, South Park: The Stick of Truth is a fantastic game.  It's like a raunchy Earthbound with Super Mario RPG style timed battle mechanics.  The world of modern day kids playing make believe fantasy is fantastic setting for an RPG and feels really fresh. You really never really know where the game will take you next. And the game mines alot of RPG and videogame tropes for some pretty funny humor.  It doesn't waste your time will filler content; it's a tightly edited, sleek 12-14 hour package.  Some of the attempts at humor may make you roll your eyes a bit, but Stick of Truth is a game regardless.  But perhaps most surprising, despite the abuse and ridicule it sometimes dishes out to it's characters, it is clearly game that has a lot of heart and views its characters endearingly.  It's Charlie Brown for a more cynical era combined with a well crafted RPG. Recommended.","March 7, 2014","true","20.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

Tons of references from the show and movie. The combat is highly simplified and gets extremely tedious and repetitive, but you can't expect much from combat from a South Park rpg. No matter which class you pick it always makes sense to still equip the weapon that does the most dmg and the gear that gives the most armor, so most gear in the game is worthless. It has a really fun story and a lot of great humor, although personally I did not care much for the ending. I thought it was kinda stupid and kind of a cop out and it could have been much more epic. As it was, the ending was pretty non-epic. Overall it is a mediocre rpg, but a fantastic South Park themed game that has more than enough characters and references for any SP fan. Non fans should pass this up because it really was made for SP fans directly. In any other game this would be a terribly simplistic rpg. But considering all past South Park games have all been horrible garbage, this is pretty good for a South Park game. Still not worth more than one playthrough. Very faithfully represents the show in all aspects but is dragged down somewhat by highly repetitive and extremely tedious combat.\n\n6/10 combat.\n6/10 gameplay.\n5/10 rpg elements.\n10/10 faithfully represents South Park in great detail.\n7/10 overall.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeroxxx/recommended/213670/","zeroxxx","zeroxxx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeroxxx/","2762 products in account","Apparently this game has strong ties with its TV show counterpart, but I am being ignorant for it as I've never even heard it, so this review is based on purely the gameplay/technical aspect of the game alone.\n\nSouth Park is a light RPG with cartoonish graphic which is full of (apparently) comedy from start to finish. I am not a type that can stomach this kind of disgusting jokes in-game, though.\n\nFrom a quick glance, you might think it's suitable for children, but no it's not. Even the rating says it's not, so don't ever let your children/kids play this game.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly simple, you control one character on 2D map, can move right left to explore the areas, unlock new rooms and do some quests to progress. The map is fairly large, but there's a quick travel (think about Waypoints in Diablo 3) so you can deliver quest items around faster.\n\nBeing an RPG, there's bound to be battle screen. The battle screen is loaded when your character comes in contact with enemy - more or less Mapped Enemies - so there's no annoying random battles, because you can avoid battles if you want (except boss battles or forced fights). When in battle your 2 characters take turns like traditional RPGs, can use items, skills or magic. The standard aspect of RPG battles still applies here, as enemies often have strong resistance against certain elements, so you need to research the enemies first before attacking.\n\nThe sound/OSTs are so so for my taste, nothing really caught my attention. But the good side is that the game is fully voiced, meaning you will hear characters speaking whether in battle or in map/normal exploration.\n\nFrom technical side, I've heard about a bug where you will get skipped cutscene during certain event, see this link: South Park Wiki, but I didn't encounter it. Still, I did as what advised and saved my game before it's too late. As a whole, the game is very smooth on maxed settings on my laptop, and I can play with my xinput Logitech F310 controller without issue as well.\n\nOnce you beat the game, it won't end like Final Fantasy 7 for example, where you can only replay the game from your last savepoint. You'll be allowed to return to the map to continue your sidequests, along with your latest equipments, that you haven't finished. But there are missables so if you fail to get them in the first place, you need to restart your playthrough from the beginning / new save.\n\nDLCs are garbage, don't buy them - what an awful quick cash grab from Ubisoft, but it's to be expected. However, for some unknown reason, this version does NOT contain uPlay. Hooraaaaayyyyy! One of redeeming point of this game for me.\n\nSo am I going to recommend the game? Absolutely, despite its flaws for me, but only when it's discounted. I personally paid this game for like 2 USD on legitimate/endorsed Steam key distributor for 12-15 hours of entertainment - well worth it. So if you haven't bought it, chances are you will be able to get the same price like me in the future.\n\n6/10 - barely-made-it score.","October 17, 2015","true","24.9"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","2"

I'm not even done with the game yet (I plan to do all the sidequests. I completed the main story, and I thought it was hilarious all the way through.)\n\nI can't think of anything bad about this game. I've been a longtime fan of South Park. I love the show, and playing this was my first experience with their games (I hear the others are really bad but, I don't know first hand). I laughed all the way through, I thought the gameplay was amazing, and it was great. Normally I hate turn-based games, with few exceptions like Pokemon or old Final Fantasy or Paper Mario. This game actually brought me a feeling of nostalgia, not just because I watched South Park throughout my life, but the nostalgia of using the turn-based system that's comparable to Paper Mario. Take the combat of Paper Mario, and the ridiculousness and humor of South Park, and you've got an amazing game.\n\n10/10 would go to Ottawa again.","December 2, 2014","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For some people, that would be enough. For me, I felt this was Obsidian's weakest game and filled with more bugs than expected in one of their non-open-world efforts.\n\nThe game is a linear adventure -- definitely not an RPG -- and the fights are a weird mix of QTEs and turn-based battles. The game outside of combat is fetch quests and collect-them-all activities.\n\nOn the other hand, the narrative itself is very entertaining, the voice acting is superb (although there is a problem with the audio sync), and... well, it's South Park, so hilariously offensive. Tremendous amount of fan service here.\n\nSo is it a great game? No, not quite. Is it worth playing? If you're a South Park fan, absolutely. Just don't be mislead by the developer's pedigree and the description into thinking this is anything but a 20-hour linear adventure.","May 18, 2014","true","20.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not even done with the game yet (I plan to do all the sidequests. I completed the main story, and I thought it was hilarious all the way through.)\n\nI can't think of anything bad about this game. I've been a longtime fan of South Park. I love the show, and playing this was my first experience with their games (I hear the others are really bad but, I don't know first hand). I laughed all the way through, I thought the gameplay was amazing, and it was great. Normally I hate turn-based games, with few exceptions like Pokemon or old Final Fantasy or Paper Mario. This game actually brought me a feeling of nostalgia, not just because I watched South Park throughout my life, but the nostalgia of using the turn-based system that's comparable to Paper Mario. Take the combat of Paper Mario, and the ridiculousness and humor of South Park, and you've got an amazing game.\n\n10/10 would go to Ottawa again.","December 2, 2014","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was wary at first because I loathe turn-based RPG games, but in true South Park fashion the game parodies the mechanics to make it fun to play and challenging (at least to non-TBRPG players).    You play the new kid in town who finds himself caught in a power struggle over The Stick of Truth between the Cartman-led humans and the Kyle-led Elves.  Naturally, there's more to the Stick of Truth than either of these two sides realize, and soon you find yourself the only one who can save the town of South Park from an unforseen darkness!  The whole town is there for the player to explore and fart on when not doing the story missions.  The developers took the time to include as many main and side characters in the show's lore as the game could hold I think, and really helps with the feeling that you are IN South Park.  The only drawbacks are the story campaign is almost too short, sometimes the keyboard controls are not instantly intuitive, and mission objectives can be VERY vague leaving one to wonder, "what the hell am I suppossed to do??"\n\nPros:  Excellent production design: Visuals, sound effects all straight fromt he show itself.  Voice acting is top-notch to go along with the great writing.  Main and side quests vary and are fun to play through.  Lots of options for different types of play: Warrior, Mage, Jew, etc.\n\nCons: A bit on the short side, limited replayability unless you want to explore all the different character classes, keyboard controls for certain powers can be confusing, vague mission objectives at times.\n\nAgain, fans of the show should enjoy it since it's about as close to playing an episode of South Park as one can get.","January 12, 2015","true","17.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And I would go so far as to call this one of the best licensed games ever created. It really does capture the full feel of the South Park world, with the legitimate crude humor thanks to the involvement of the creators.\n\nThere are tons of references to many events throughout the South Park episodes and movies, and discovering them will feel rewarding, though most of these references do not play much role in the story.\n\nWho do I recommend it to?\n\nSouth Park fans; For certain! The more you have watched of the show, the better, to get more of the references. However, it isn't essential to have watched all of the show to still enjoy the scenarios, story, and humor.\n\nNon-South park fans; I would generally not recommend it simply because it is that faithful to south park, so if you do not like south park you likely won't like this. However, there is always a chance that this could serve like a different way to gain a taste for the show.\n\nThe downside; I do wish it could have been much longer. Ironically, because the game put the universe together so beautifully I was left wanting even more, despite it having an already great playability time.\n\nAs one whom is a strong South Park fan (having watched every single episode of the show, and the movies as well), I give it a strong 8.5/10.\n\nHere's hoping for a sequel or expansion!","January 12, 2015","true","25.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emblemparade/recommended/213670/","emblemparade","Emblem Parade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emblemparade/","3124 products in account","This is a surprisingly delightful, long, and non-linear RPG that rewards exploration and experimentation, has lots of worthwhile and fun side-quests and achievements, all wrapped around an excellent story that is full of unexpected twists.\n\nIt is also a ridiculously funny South Park episode, which is centered around a parody of the fantasy RPG genre. Note, though, that you won't find any new components: all the characters, gags, songs, and themes have already been used and abused to death on the TV show. I guess it's inevitable that a TV show that has been running for so long has to get so self-referential. But, well, some things are always funny. Like farts.\n\nTo fully enjoy this game, you MUST play it with a gamepad/controller, as it makes ingenious use of its physicality and vibrations. I played with an Xbox-compatible one, which was recognized without any configuration.\n\nI say "surprising" because I was expecting a casual gaming experience with the South Park story at its center. But it's actually a very sophisticated game, with loads of cool loot you can find, sell, and buy, worthwhile abilities and spells to upgrade to, and a diverse set of companions to assist you in battle. And it's not too easy, at least on the default difficulty level. Note, though, that if you're a serious RPG player, you'll probably indeed find it easy: as soon as you level up enough and get good gear, somewhere in the middle of the game, combat because boring and repetitive, because you've already figured out how to win in every situation. I found a combination that could win almost every battle in two rounds. No problem, just increase the difficulty level, which you can do anytime during the game.\n\nI had so much fun with this. :) I don't see much point in a sequel (every single South Park theme I can think of was shamelessly shoved into this game), but I hope this team of devs and creative folk get together on a similar project in the future. Kudos to everyone involved, it's a triumph, and one of my favorite gaming experiences of 2014!","December 30, 2014","true","23.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It plays like an interactive episode of the show, with Trey and Matt keeping exactly the same quality as you would find simply watching. Gameplay is very good and definitely fun, the biggest issues being a lack of balance between weapons and armor, and certain armor patches not working (X% weapon damage, thorns damage apparently being applied to your weapon) but they're easily ignored as you have fun exploring the town and hearing Butters or Cartman spout their usual banter.\n\nThe only people I might not recommend this to are people not familiar with the show, but even then, credit should be given to Oblivion for helping flesh out what was essentially a 2-parter parody episode, and giving it a life of its own. My biggest regret is not picking up the game sooner. If you're somehow still on the fence about this, don't be.

This game tries, and succeeds, at being similar to an actual episode. If you find the humor of the show unenjoyable, avoid this game. It's an RPG that is incredibly similar to Paper Mario, due to the presence of quicktime events during combat (right clicking on time to defend, clicking on time to swing, etc.) and the "buddy" system, where you obtain multiple friends that have different abilities both inside and out of combat. If you played and enjoyed that game (or its sequel) then you should also consider this game.\n\nPROS\n-Similar to South Park episodes, with loads of references\n-Relatively long at 10-15 hours (I finished all the quests, but not all the collectables, at about 14 hours myself)\n-Fun, interesting combat\n-You can customize your character quite a bit (but you don't have to)\n\nCONS\n-Too easy: while I did die a dozen times or so, I felt like the "Hardcore" difficulty should have been more brutal.\n-Quite a few loading screens (they're short, but it's still not optimal)\n-The music, while decent, can be repetitive\n-There are a couple collectables that can only be obtained during small parts of the game. If you want to get 100%, you basically have to use a guide, or be very thorough lest you have to play through the entire game twice\n-The saving system is poor, and obviously due to the fact that it's a console port - it uses checkpoints and I occasionally found myself using the quick travel system just to get it to trigger a checkpoint.\n\nOverall, I would get it if you like South Park and like RPGs. If you don't like one of those two things, either get it on a large sale or don't buy it at all.","December 27, 2014","true","14.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I just beat it and I know it is not even out everywhere in the world yet. I give it an 8.7 out of 10. I do this because I both love South Park, and turn based RPG's. It was really up my alley. This is the first time in a long time that I have enjoyed playing every minute of a game up until the very end.... Which brings me to the only downside... I have 12 hours played and I beat it. Now I know there is likely another 3 or 4 hours of side content in there... But I am max level... I have the best equipment... I can run around looking behind buildings and getting lost in the sewers trying to collect every last friend and chimpokemon (Spelling pending) but I just do not find joy in that. The other issue being it is a 60$ game... It is very hard to justify that price tag when Skyrim is sitting at the same for literally unlimited content... Not saying they are comparable genre wise really. I am just noting total play hours.( Do not get too hung up on why Skyrim is completely unlike SP, I know; thanks.) Do not focus on that negative part of the review though. The whole thing was hilarious as one would expect.

Many have said it already, but this is just like playing through several episodes of South Park. There will be all the jokes you might expect from the show, so those who are easily offended (or have no idea what South Park is – where have you been living the past 15 years or so?) might want to give the game a pass.

The combat is also a very solid, familiar turn-based structure, but with the added flair of timed blocks and attacks, so it's not quite as set-and-forget as Final Fantasy and the like. Customization is quite varied, both cosmetic and strategic. You'll often find yourself poring over weapon and gear attachments, debating the merit of stacking certain debuffs or rigging up an anti-armor set instead. The main questline itself, yes, is about four hours long. However, this ignores the gigantic array of worthwhile side quests, which are absolutely worth noting. Replay value is also high, with four classes to choose from, each with a unique array of powers for different playstyles. Long-time fans of South Park will recognize a lot of recurring jokes both new and old, and newcomers will get a pretty strong feel for the show, in a good way. While it is absolutely worth your time, I do strongly suggest waiting for a sale. While it may be Trey and Matt's first real game, in a lot of ways it feels better planned out and executed than a lot of games released by veteran studios today. Absolutely recommended. 10/10","May 14, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
