This game lacks that appeal for several reasons. The controls are limited (you only control direction and power) as there is no ability to put backspin on the ball or angle the ball off of your club. The physics are cartoonish leading to frustrating moments where reality does not align with your plan. Additionally, certain objects and boundaries/walls within the holes themselves are not modeled very well and can never be trusted to bounce where one would expect (imagine running in an action-oriented game in a wide-open field then being halted by an invisible wall).\n\nEdit: Realized this game was made in 2006. My expectations are lowered but the comments above are still applicable today.","May 2, 2015","false","0.2"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

When I initially bought it, I had quite a lot of fun messing around with friends and as a whole wasn't so bad, but there are definitely improvements that need to be made. The graphics are meh, and it is quite glitchy on certain maps, too. It gets very repetetive after awhile, and hasn't been played in over 3-4 months I imagine, and if I have played it since, it wouldn't have been for very long.
