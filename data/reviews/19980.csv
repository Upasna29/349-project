The controls are simple and make all the well animated jumping and running easy to pull off. The graphics are very beautiful, almost like playing in some kind of painting.\n\nThe game is rather easy, since you can never die. If you fall or miss your jump, your partner Elika will pull you back onto solid ground. If you start to lose in a battle, she will pull you to safety, knocking the enemy back. However, the enemy will regain some of it's lost health for doing so. To me, this is a really great option. Sometimes games are just meant to be fun, and not so much to provide a hardcore challange that will only end up frustrating.\n\nCombat is fun and smooth, with great attack animations. You can attack with your sword, you can grab an enemy, and you can let Elika attack. You can combo all sorts of beautiful moves together to make for an awesome fight scene. None of the bad guys should really give you too much trouble, especially since right before you would "die", a button will pop up and if you press it in time you avoid the "final" blow, so that way Elika doesn't have to save you and the enemy's health stays where it's at.\n\nThe environments are great to look at. The world starts off all dark and dreary with corruption, but as you heal the lands, everything becomes bright and green and lush again.\n\nMost of the time you'll have to go through an area twice, once to get to the fertile ground so you can heal it, and then you'll probably want to go through it again after it's been healed so you can collect all the Light Seeds lying around. You collect Light Seeds in order to "buy" special powers that Elika can use for platforming, which allows you to get to new areas.\n\nThe voice acting and script of the game are not top-notch, but are certainly passable. Personally, I found the soundtrack and plot incredibly pleasing.\n\nOverall, Prince of Persia is quite fun; however, it is not for those who don't want to relax. Challenge-seekers will be severely disappointed, and those looking for excitement will also be let down. For those who seek a fun and relaxing experience in a richly textured world, on the other hand, Prince of Persia is the game to play.","December 26, 2013","true","10.9"," 171 of 190 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","171","190","0","8"

As such, I approached the game with a mix of curiosity and caution.\n\nWhat I found was a beautiful, mesmerizing experience.\n\nThe graphics and the music are striking, from the first moment. I understand that the game extensively cell-shaded appearance can be a love-it-or-hate-it experience which won't appeal to everybody, yet I found the game atmosphere beautiful and enticing. Every scenery is wonderfully drawn, and every moment it feels like you are watching a fairy tale unfold before your eyes. I found myself stopping every now and then to look around and visually explore the enviroment around me, taking the time to appreciate the details of the level rather than just calculating where I should aim my next jump.\nThe rendition of the Prince is also my favourite, so far. Having played through the original Prince of Persia, back in the MS-DOS days, and also through the whole "Sands of time" trilogy, I must say I like this version of the Prince the most. This has mainly to do with the Prince's attitude. There is no sense of urgency in this game, no running against the clock, no being pursued by a deadly monster, no ambition, or thirst for power driving the game's protagonist. He simply stumbled upon an ancient evil which is about to be unleashed; however, he still has all the time in the world to stop him. He embraces the adventure he suddenly found himself in and just goes with the flow, always smiling, always relaxed. When controlling the Prince, you can rush from one level to the next, pursuing enemies, or you can stop and go for a walk through the desert under the moon: nobody's coming at you. This is your story, have it your way.\n\nSpeaking about the actual gameplay, a great deal of criticism stems from its dumbed-down difficulty. In fact, there is no "game over" screen, as there is no way to die. Whenever you fall to your death, you witness a cutscene where Elika saves you instead. This is merely a convenience, though: each time you see the cutscene, you know you screwed up; only you don't have to worry about saving, reloading or continuing. To me, that's perfectly fine.\nComing from the "Sands of time" trilogy, the difficulty of navigating treacherous environments feels reduced as well. There are no spikes or deadly contraptions you have to avoid, most envirnomental hazards are about well-timed jumps and avoiding falls. The controls are easy to master, and there is some amount of auto-pilot helping you navigate the most treacherous parkours. All in all, navigating a level feels more relaxing than challenging, although you will sometime need several attempts to figure out how to traverse a difficult section.\n\nThe combat system is maybe this game biggest flaw. There are very few enemies scattered throughout the game, so virtually every fight will be a boss fight. You cannot die, but each time you are saved by Elika, your opponent has a chance to recover some life, protracting the battle longer. Fighting in this game is mostly about quick-time events and stringing together your attacks in a long combo, in order to maximize damage. Then it's parrying and ducking, until you can start a combo again. The whole control system seemed stiff here, and whenever I though I had an opening to start a combo I ended up being hit instead. All in all, I never developed a good feeling with the battle system, and boss battles degenerated in a chore rather than a fun experience.\n\nUltimately, this game might not be for players or long time series fan who are looking for a challenge, but I think its visual style and atmosphere earn this title a place in any gamer's collection. It looks and feels like a remarkable work of art; and each time you complete a level, you watch the scenery transform around you, feeling a genuine sense of reward for your efforts. I definitely recommend to try this one out.","October 16, 2014","true","14.1"," 73 of 77 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","73","77","3","0"

So the idea was to instal and play a relaxing game while I wait for Arkham Knight to get released.\n\nWell, the 2008 me was kinda wrong... the combat in this game is just awful and cringe inducing, I have no idea what they were thinking when they made it so that you're blocking 70% of the time, with maybe 15% of free fighting, and 15% quick time events/button mashing. Maybe they were trying to make it harder artificially when they realized the game was too short and fun and easy, I don't know... but I wish the game had 0 combat and more environmental puzzles to fill in the blanks. Luckily though, there are not a ton of fights in the game, so they don't completely destroy the mood.\n\nThe controls could be a bit tighter, but they aren't horrible, they work... I mean it's a Ubisoft parkour game, you can't expect anything more out of it really.\n\nThe story is next to non-existent and that's OK. You're looking for a donkey, but instead you find a princess, now help her save the world... c'mon man, do it! She may not be a donkey, but she's hawt.\n\nThe game came out in 2008, and it looks absolutely amazing even by today's standards, with maybe some stiff animations and facial expressions that wouldn't be present if it were released today.\n\nAll in all, if you love and miss Playstation 2 era platformers, this game might just tickle your nut$@ck. - 7.5/10","June 22, 2015","true","5.6"," 46 of 54 people (85%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","85","46","54","14","3"

The instant revival system that recieved a tsunami of hate is there, yes, however this is not necessarily a bad thing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luriam/recommended/19980/","Luriam","Luriam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luriam/","307 products in account","As a fan of the Prince of Persia™ franchise, I just couldn't miss this one. And it blew my mind.\n\n\nThis game was just what I needed. Like a ray of pure light it purged the ideas of blood, brutal violence, and gory deaths. This particular game was full of magic. And when I say magic, I mean it. The world is just beautiful. Filled with gorgeous landscapes such as: huge mountains, shining rivers, caves and caverns, flowery plains and other delightful sights. And that's just the "nature" part. There are also a large number of beautifully designed buildings. Some go deep underground, and others reach the throat of the world. Which is both beautiful, and impressive. Especially when there is a Day/Night cycle. And the nights are full of wonders.\n\n\nThe new protagonist is a nameless adventurer in search of fortune. Which, even though called a Prince, is not one. The adventurer is accompanied by an Ahura named Elika, whose race has forsaken the duty given to them by the god of light, Ormazd, and intend to set free the main antagonist, Ahriman. Ahriman is the god of darkness who was imprisoned by Ormazd. The game is a constant fight between the forces of Lights and Darkness. In order to entrap Ahriman and his 4 Corrupted followers once and for all.\n\n\nMost of the gameplay is still intact. The player can use the Prince character's acrobatic prowess, sword, and gauntlet, as well as magic from Elika to perform combat and acrobatic feats variously throughout the game. Which not only looks stunning, but also causes more damage if you chain all the attacks together. The game features open world exploration that allows the player to travel to any spot in the game world at any given point, and lets the player witness the plot in any way they want. The traps are manifested in various forms of the antagonist Ahriman's Corruption. Black-colored blobs that coat the land and swallow the player if touched. The player can use acrobatic maneuvers to avoid these traps. And after they heal the land, the traps are purged completely.\n\n\nThe player can not conventionally "die" in Prince of Persia. Rather, when an enemy is about to strike the finishing blow, or The Prince presumably falls to his death, Elika saves him. But by doing this, the enemy has time to regain it's health. The combat is tricky at first, but when you get the hang of blocking and deflecting attacks, you won't go down anymore.\n\n\nThe voice acting is probably my favorite part of this game. As soon as the Prince started talking, I knew it was Nolan North. And the game would be full of jokes, witty comments, and funny remarks. And boy, I laughed my face off. Elika was serious about the imminent apocalypse, while the Prince was joking around most of the time, making this adventure less tensioned. Take a look at this:\n\n\nPrince: I hope that hurt!\nElika: He can’t hear you.\nPrince: He can’t?! And you're an ugly mother too!\n[Elika gives him a look]\nPrince: What?\n\n\nOr this:\n\n\nElika: Tell me about your family.\nPrince: I don't have a family.\nElika: Well, you come from somewhere.\nPrince: Yes, and I'm going somewhere else.\n\n\n\nAlthough I find Yuri Lowenthal's voice more charismatic and touching, I cannon resist Nolan North's. His voice created so many amazing characters...\n\n\nAlright, last one:\n\n\nPrince: Want to play a game ? Come on, it'll be fun !\nElika: The World's about to end and you want to play a game ?!\nPrince: Might as well die happy.\nElika: What sort of game is this ?\nPrince: Well, I see something and you have to guess what it is.\nElika: How can I guess that ?\nPrince: You just guess.\nElika: Grass.\nPrince: No.\nElika: Rock.\nPrince: No.\nElika: This is a stupid game.\n...\nPrince: Want another go ?\nElika: No... Path.\nPrince: No.\nElika: This is impossible !\n...\nPrince: The game would be easier if we played it by the rules.\nElika: There are rules ?\nPrince: Yeah. I tell you the first letter.\nElika: Then why didn't you do that ?\nPrince: You didn't give me a chance.\nElika: *sigh* Can we get to the Fertile Ground ?\n...\nPrince: S.\nElika: Are you still playing that game ?\nPrince: S.\nElika: Sky.\nPrince: Hey! You got it! Okay, your turn.\n...\nPrince: Come on, your turn.\nElika: For what ? Uhm... C.\nPrince: Corruption.\nElika: Yes. Can we go on ?\n...\nPrince: S.\nElika: Sky again ?\nPrince: Now you're getting it !\nElika: You picked 'sky' again ?\nPrince: No, but you're getting the hang of the rules.\nElika: Ah, thanks, they're so complex I was worried they might evade me.\n...\nPrince: S.\nElika: Scar.\nPrince: No.\nElika: Scarf ?\nPrince: No.\nElika: Shrine ?\nPrince: Aha! No.\nElika: I give up.\nPrince: It's too soon to give up.\nElika: I give up !\nPrince: Soulless Follower of Ahriman !\nElika: I am amazed no one threw you overboard on your sea trips.\n...\nPrince: G.\nElika: Are you still playing ?\nPrince: G !\nElika: Gauntlet.\nPrince: Yes !\nElika: You wanna make this game harder ?\n...\nPrince: Wanna play the game again for forfeits ?\nElika: No.\n\n\nI was even laughing while I was re-checking the text again. Ubisoft, thank you for choosing Nolan North.\n\n\nNow the music. Stuart Chatwood and Inon Zur, my favorite composers. They created this amazing, vibrant music for the game. Both epic and fantastic. When you are roaming around the plains, and other healed ground. A soft, relaxing, light music is playing. And when a fight starts, the drums and flutes are pulsing and come crashing down. Both of these create the perfect atmosphere.\n\n\nAs I said, this game is just stunning. Full of adventuring, jokes, fights, flights, magic, beauty, and romance too. I had so much fun playing it, and I still do. I recommend this game to everyone who enjoys an epic adventure.\n\n\n10/10","March 19, 2014","true","6.0"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spincube/recommended/19980/","spincube","spincube","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spincube/","310 products in account","This game is beautiful, but bland. Most of your time will be spent parkour-ing around mini-hubs in search of enough collectibles to open up further mini-hubs to parkour around to collect more collectibles, and so on.\n\nThere is one way to play this game: each location has a set number of collectibles to find, that can only be accessed by taking a specific route. Failure to take the appropriate route - for example, by mis-timing a jump, or falling into a trap - means you get caught by your companion, and dropped off at the last flat terrain you were stood on. This means there's very little sense of scale to your surroundings: the only difference between being hundreds of feet in the air dangling from a cliff edge, or hanging from an archway above the ground, is the skybox. Fall off the edge and whoops, try again, you're back at the start.\n\nThe graphics are sharp and vivid, colours are vibrant, and there's a clear distinction between areas you've 'healed' and those that are on the checklist. There's even a nice subtle visual effect - what's it called? where the corners of the screen dim? - that appears when you pass from safe to dangerous areas.\n\nThere's not really a lot to the game, in all honesty. What kills it for me is the total lack of variety - enemies are few and far between, and generally exist as an obstacle to slow down your progress (as with the collectibles). Combat consists of waiting for the enemy to strike, parrying, and using a certain weapon to attack (that the game helpfully pauses combat to explain). Even the parkour isn't very interesting, as all the areas you are capable of traversing are marked with certain visual cues: 'wallrun here' areas are all marked with the same scraped texture, for example, and 'climb this ledge' areas have the same scuffed edges. So there's hardly even a sense of exploration, or experimentation: it's like you're told how to solve the puzzle before even attempting the puzzle.\n\nOther miscellaneous points:\nThe player protagonist isn't either an obnoxious misanthrope, or a wisecracking cynic. Dude just wants to save the day and then go home with his donkey, which is admirable. The Princess is your standard warm-hearted 'i must reclaim my land from evil' archetype, but mostly exists outside of cutscenes to be dragged around the scenery with you and fed the collectibles.\nThe game itself is fully controller-compatible, but for some reason there's a launcher screen with a 'Launch the game!' option that you'll need a mouse for. Of course, graphics options etc. are also to be found in the launcher, rather than in-game.\nThe soundtrack isn't anything to celebrate: vague 'you are exploring an Arabian Nights-ish landscape' sonic wallpaper, nothing special or memorable.","February 22, 2014","false","11.1"," 87 of 143 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","87","143","2","0"

It was God-awful. Normally I am a fan of Nolan North's work but I am afraid just not here.\n\nThis re-imagining of the past POP classics takes the game in a slightly different direction. Not only does it introduce a new art style, which is simply breathtaking, but it removes the frustration of death which I am sure will not please many hardcore gamers. This exclusion does keep the game moving at a frantic pace and for pure adrenalin based platform fun, it can't be beaten.\n\nThe story even wraps up with an emotional twist giving the player the choice to choose selfishly or selflessly for love. The only other negatives I can think of apart from the voice-work and script are the somewhat erratic camera, which this series has suffered with since the Sands of Time, often leading to a variety of frustrating mishaps when the action is moving at a cracking pace.

Sort of..\n\nI was actually impressed at how it remains quite linear whilst still being open world. Mostly regarding pathing and traversal in between objectives and choosing what order you do the objectives.\n\nTHIS GAME IS TOO EASY. You literally cannot die. You can't.. Not that you would come close to doing that anyways. All the battles are one on one (2v1 really) but the second person is more of a type of attack and traversal method. The enemies will do stance changes which have visual indications to the effect that only specific types of attacks will affect them where they will go back to regular stance. There are occasional quicktime events in which should you press the wrong button, the only consequence is that the enemy recovers a small bit of health.\n\nTraversal is probably the main draw here. Enviromental puzzles have long been a staple of the Prince of Persia IP. But this too is also easy. Any mistakes made during traversal you are saved by your random encounter companion and brought back to the last flat platform. All in all, this bascially "no fail" state makes the game fairly relaxing as jumping around and collecting "light shards" is fairly mindless and feels pretty good. (and is required to progress)\n\nThe narrative throughline I found rather unengaging.  The Prince is voiced by Nolan North (the voice of everything that isn't played by Troy Baker.) His performance wasn't bad its just what was being said wasn't interesting. There is a twist in the ending that is fairly unique. Though there a comparison a specific PS2 exclusive (PS3 remake) game that I wont name due to potential spoliers. I won't even put it behind a black bar.\n\nI re-read what I just wrote and I feel like it comes off more negative than I intended. Nonetheless it remains accurrate.

You end up running through  the same patterns during the whole damn game. You fight each of the few bosses several times with litterally no differances in your approach (fights are just QTEs btw). The puzzles do nothing but slow down the pace for a short bit but won't require you to think much. The game allows you to interact with magical plates at some point, which allows you to get to new areas, but they don't bring any kind of diversity to the gameplay and are pretty flappin' anoying (especially the yellow ones)\nThe game is litterally just a succsession of QTEs, with a complete absence of challenge. The fact that you can't die, even during combats, thanks you your qt magical gf, removes any kind of threatning situation. All that's keeping you away from the end of the game is just the fact that you have to collect shiny stuffs that are all arround the place. It's entertaining at first but it's really all there is to do, and it's not satisfying.\n\nThis game stands as a reminder of why QTEs are dumb ♥♥♥♥ and why having a "fail state" is vital to any game of this kind.

In Windows 7 64-bit, I could launch to the menu but the game would hang while loading the first level. A quick look at the forums indicated that enabling Vertical Sync in the settings would fix this; it did. Still, this game came out nearly 7 years ago and Ubisoft has never addressed this common issue. The only other technical failure I ran into was the lack of screenshot capability, which is more of a design flaw than a bug. Uplay is not required but its existence likely played into the decision to disable the Steam overlay, and its screenshot function.\n\nWhile I can forgive these technical missteps, I cannot forgive this game's story. Without spoiling anything, this game clearly ended with the expectation that there would be a sequel. However, there hasn't been a sequel and more than likely there never will be. Even the DLC epilogue doesn't wrap things up at all. At best it gives an indication of where the writers were planning to take things after the main game's ending. If you are playing on PC, that epilogue isn't available to you. I watched it (mostly at 2x speed) on YouTube.\n\nWorse than the lack of a satisfying conclusion was the content of the ending. It clashes with the tone of the rest of the game and feels mismatched and forced. It's a slap in the face to the players and everything they felt like they accomplished in the game. Prince of Persia does a good job of building characters and setting but the plot was poor throughout and left me shaking my head as the credits rolled. This is particularly unfortunate because the two leading characters are generally very likable with great voice acting and good dialogue.\n\nBy 2015 standards the gameplay of Prince of Persia is rather poor. In 2008 it was probably slightly above average. My biggest issue with the acrobatics is how they feel nearly automatic or partially "on rails." You are required to push one of three buttons as you jump, swing or use magic to get around in your virtual playground. Precision is rarely necessary. Same for creativity since there is typically only one correct way across a specific pathway. Combat has a four button combo system and quick time events but never developed a pleasant flow in my hands. It also doesn't evolve at all as the game progresses. Tack on nearly no consequences for failure and you have gameplay that has little challenge or urgency to it. Oh, and you need to collect roughly 600 Light Seeds floating around the world in order to finish the game. That's not fun-- it's tedious.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't offer up some praise for the artists behind this game. Both visually and aurally Prince of Persia is a joy to behold. The designs of the two primary characters are distinct and memorable. The environments, while clearly laid out with gameplay as first priority, are beautiful with a grand sense of scale. The soundtrack contains a nice fusion of common eastern themes, epic orchestral scores and a wondrous magical quality. It's too bad that the good in Prince of Persia is so badly undermined by its flaws.","November 2, 2015","false","13.2"," 33 of 54 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","33","54","0","2"

Since I didn't get to finish it there, I wanted to play it on the PC.\n\nPros:\nLooks beautiful, especially after you have cleansed an area. There's lots of really nice Middle Eastern architecture to look at and a nice ambience overall. Best played with the lights off to get the full effect.\nOccasionally funny dialogue between the protagonists.\nPuzzles can be challenging at times, I wish there were more.\nCons:\nNo non-boss enemies. You don't really fight anything that isn't a boss like animals or other hostiles. You can't use your sword outside of battle to cut stuff or anything.\nNo depth to fighting style. Essentially, you can get away with continually hitting the attack button and dodging the enemy. There aren't any real combos other than magic/sword/magic. You don't learn any new moves or get any new weapons as you progress.\nLight seed collection can get repetitive.\nWhen you fall off, you go back to last piece of level ground you were standing on, which could have been really far back, forcing you to repeat the jumping sequence you just did.\nStory could use a little tweaking.\nOther:\nYou can't seem to die. Ever. Falling off ledges, almost getting skewered by the Hunter, getting sucked up into goo . . . everytime you will be saved by Elika. Even when she is trapped by one of the enemies! She can't free herself, but some how can reach across the arena and grab your arm.\nI hope you like parkour because there's a lot of it. Sometimes it's fun and fluid, especially when you have a good rhythm going.\nThere's quick action sequences during boss fights reminiscent of Resident Evil 4.\nOverall, this isn't the type of game I see myself playing for several days in a row, but more of a game I come back to whenever I need to take a break. I still recommend it though.\n\nNote: I have never played any other PoP game before this one, so I can't compare it to previous installments in the franchise.","January 1","true","13.9"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","14","19","3","0"

It has a great art style, amazing exploration in gorgeous environments of which you'll see both a light and a dark version and a good story with strong, well-voiced characters.\nYou traverse a desert environment, fix it using magic powers and try to find out what's going on exactly. On your quest you are accompanied by Elika, who seems to have a better idea of what's going on but doesn't quite feel like sharing. She helps you in combat, while platforming and when you mess up she saves you at the last second every time. Some people disliked this, claiming it removes the challenge, but it is little more than a cleverly (and charmingly) masked respawn system and will not detract from your enjoyment.\n\nIt's not all great though.\nCombat is not as fluent as you'd expect, either from the series or an action game in general, and there is a severe lack of variety in the enemies. I'd argue that the focus is more on the exploration and platforming anyway, but that doesn't quite excuse this level of laziness.\nThen there's the point specific to this version. How integrated with Steam a game is is completely up to the developers. Since this is published by Ubisoft (which has its own competing system, uPlay) it wasn't much of a surprise to see no trading cards or achievements on Steam, but the Steam overlay isn't even available. This means no in-game chatting or easily checking the time and, worst of all (to me), no screenshot functionality.\n\nIf you have a console (the game came out on XBox 360 and PS3 as well) it would make sense to me to get it there instead, but I had no problem with this version either. Just wished it had been given a bit more love in its conversion so that it matches the amount of care and dedication that went into the game itself.\n\nSummary:\n+Best platforming\n+Good story\n+No uPlay required (or in fact possible)\n-Shallow combat\n-Poor Steam integration","March 24, 2014","true","2.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

The before-and-after transitions as you cleanse areas of their corruption are also enjoyable to see.\n\nElika manages, unlike Farah in Sands of Time, to stay out of your way and not shoot you with arrows, while still being there whenever you want to use her to enable a special ability (or to catch you when you fall). The byplay between her and the Prince is also enjoyable rather than intrusive, with the ability to prompt her for narrative on demand to flesh out the unavoidable bare-bones version allowing you to explore the setting and backplot at your leisure.\n\nWhile the environments make little sense if you think about them too hard, taken on their own terms, they generally have an internal logic that can help you understand where to go and how to solve the various minor puzzles on the way.\n\nThe game also gives you a lot of freedom in which order you tackle its regions - you can explore most of the game's area as soon as you unlock the double-jump, though for most regions, healing them requires you to unlock one of the four special abilities, and in turn unlocks the collectible "light seeds" you need to unlock another ability. Each ability immediately gives you access to the associated sacred grounds (with a little travelling to get there) so you can choose which to tackle next.\n\n\nThe bad:\n\nWhile some of the achievements are more challenging, including speed-running between certain landmarks, for the most part, the game lacks a sense of challenge - the boss fights are more like extended QTEs, and so are the journeys from place to place - while the paths themselves wind around, and parts may be visible from (in terms of travel time) far away, when you're actually travelling them, they're almost entirely linear - it's less a question of picking your route from A to B and more of launching yourself in the right direction, and tapping the right buttons at the right moments, as cued by chunks of environment.\n\nWhen it comes to combat, there are fights against the four bosses, who you will face several times in their respective territories before finally eliminating them, each of whom has their own quirks, and keys to being defeated, but the only other enemies are boundary guardians between areas, who can be defeated either by traversing the route to them rapidly, or by facing them in combat - a good opportunity to work on your combos, but not so much for actual challenge.\n\nThe highly structured nature of the game also means that, while each area has its own minor quirks, once you get a feel for the overall structure, the only real discovery comes from uncovering new bits of scenery or solving some of the game's handful of puzzles. Even finding the few light seeds that aren't automatically collected as you follow the paths from place to place becomes routine after a while.\n\nWhile the setting has a backplot and bits of history, the game's actual plot consists of meeting Elika and then going on a grand fetch quest to get the light seeds to restore the land and seal the great evil back in its can. There is some exploration of the characters history, but no development, and not much actually happens - probably mostly to support the player's freedom in choosing when to tackle each region, and whether to prompt Elika's narration.\n\n\nThe ugly:\n\nThe plot (such as it is) isn't actually resolved in the game - instead, you need to play the DLC, which isn't available for the PC version. Having to buy the endgame separately is bad enough; not being able to get it at all makes this a good example of how not to do DLC.\n\n\nOverall:\n\nIt's a very polished game, which is more fun to watch than most, but ultimately hollow - all style and very little substance. That's not necessarily a deal-breaker, but the lack of an ending leaves me unable to recommend this. If the DLC ever comes out, or if you aren't worried about closure, then sure; otherwise, you're probably better passing on it.","January 28, 2014","false","0.5"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quitch/recommended/19980/","quitch","Quitch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quitch/","378 products in account","As this review was reasonably current at the time it assumes you know one major thing new to this game in the franchise: you cannot die. Should you fall or lose a combat, your companion Elika will save you. In combat this resets the health of the enemy.\n\nI thought this would be a platformer, but it plays more like an extended quick-time event. I didn't find it took much platforming skill (I'd know if it did, I suck at them) so it was actually rather interesting stringing all those moves together. Not entirely satisfying, just more interesting.\n\nThe music seemed sparse. I see that there appears to be quite a bit of it, but it sure didn't seem that way and there was a lot of silence. I don't think it made full use of its score. I found sound balance to be an issue in general, with far too many things drowning out dialogue and even towards the end of the game I was fiddling with volume levels.\n\nThe death mechanic worked. Mostly. Where it didn't work was in allowing me to keep light seeds I gathered when I died, removing all punishment from death and making it easier than quick loading would. All in all it kept the flow of the game, which was broken less by death and more by the odd decision to have the prince pause to catch Elika on the ivy.\n\nThe majority of the game was collecting light seeds. If you only collected the precise number to open the pads you were missing a large chunk of the game. This is why it was such a kicker that there is absolutely zero reward for collecting all of them, beyond a sense of a achievement. Hunting them down was actually oddly satisfying, especially the odd tricky one which got you to think for a bit, but couldn't we get so much as a line of dialogue as a pat on the back for 100%? Considering how vital they were supposed to be to Elika this struck me as another failure in the world building.\n\nOn that front though, the view was gorgeous. Being able to stand in one land and see all the nearby lands was absolutely outstanding. The immense scale of some of it, seeing the restored clashing with the corruption; made for one hell of a sight.\n\nThe fighting system was a bit pants to be honest. You have a huge number of combos, but they're almost entirely irrelevant. You either fight an enemy with their back to the edge (push them to their death) or you fight them with your back to the edge (they can't be pushed off you need room for a combo). In the latter case you memorise the longest combo possible and then unleash it, I think mine was Elika - Elika - Gauntlet - Elika - Sword - Elika - Jump - Elika - Sword. I suspect you could go longer but since I almost never had enough space to unleash the full combo it didn't seem worth my time to find out.\n\nThe real problem is that you don't seem to have any real options in combat. The quick-time events often don't punish you for failing them and don't always reward you for passing them leaving you with the question of what they were for. Sometimes I'd deliberately let the enemy hit me just to get them out of the near invincible "Smack you back and Elika down" mode so I could fire off my combo again. For a game which was all about flow in the platforming there was none of this in the combat. And yes, Elika was painfully fussy about distance.\n\nMy next biggest complaint is the open world. I like that I could do things in the order I want, but the sacrifice was too great. The story is not the saving the world story it first appears to be but rather it's about two characters with one goal but completely different motivations. One is led by her faith in her god and redemption for the acts of her father, while the other is being strung along by his ♥♥♥♥ at first and then more emotionally intimate feelings later on. The problem is that this requires character development, development which the open world precludes from happening (along with any semblance of a difficulty curve) because every zone can be done at any time and so the dialogue maintains a pretty consistent tone throughout, you never feel that the relationship moves anywhere beyond the initial leap from chasing the girl to saving your first land. This was such an integral part of the game I can't believe it wasn't handled better, the chats upon cleansing a zone should have either been unrelated to the zone, or formed of two parts, one for the zone/opponent and one for the stage of the relationship you have reached so that you see a natural development across the course of the game.\n\nThe writing doesn't help, the characters are far too modern in the way they speak to each other, both in their choice of words and in their voicing. Maybe modern isn't the word, but it really felt off for the entire game. The writing problem extends to the enemies as well.\n\nThe characters talk about the Concubine for example driving a wedge between them, yet I didn't feel that at all. The best moment was with the Warrior where both characters interpret the events according to their biases and the writer never spells out which is correct.\n\nThis is a shame because the ending is so good, so very very good, that I wish there'd been a better build up. The characters are key to your enjoyment of the game and a better writer, or just better development spread over the course of the game, would have pushed this from good fun on a budget into superb territory.\n\nOverall, it wasn't a hugely challenging game and it certainly had its problems, but nor does it overstay its welcome and it's one of a growing number of "buddy adventure" games and that always wins a game points with me. I wouldn't have thought it worthwhile at full price, but in a sale it's worth checking out just to experience the journey if not the tightest mechanics ever seen in gaming. You will also get one of the best endings gaming has to offer.","August 5, 2014","true","0.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

There is nothing of interest in this game. You climb the same exact areas, the same exact level designs, collecting shiny orbs, with an occasional "boss" battle. It is an insultingly lazy game. Ubisoft did not care one bit about the game itself, the orb collecting and area opening aspect of the game, which is the biggest part by far, is the most boring thing ever in a game. The prince's and Elika's relationship is by far the best aspect of the game, but honestly the game is not worth playing for that reason alone. The only positve thing I can say about the game is the cellshaded graphics, and the general art direction. Other than that, just pass this one, it's not worth the money. 4/10","March 30","false","3.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

It is one of my favorites because it is a complete original concept.  I'll spoil the biggest one.  You can never die.  Honestly, I've never played a game with that before, and I really liked it.  It sped the game along.  The game you will realize, is all about speed.  The world is vast, and you explore it.  Different buttons do different things at a given point in time.  The better you get, the faster you can travel because you don't fall.  And it is blazingly fun.  But let me emphasize this.  There is a combat system, it is fun, albeit it isn't the point of the game.  Battling is just there for something different.  The point of this game is exploration.  It's an exploration game, with a storyline that is captivating.  How you transverse the environment is really fun.  The graphics were really good for its time.  The music like any game gets old after a while, but is really cool at first.  In my humble opinion this is probably the best Prince of Persia out of all of them, however I haven't played all of them, some.  I'm just making a prediction.  However, there are some problems.\n\nI know this sounds weird, but there has to be some realism to your fantasy world.  So for example, the end boss the the essence of darkness.  Yet when you traverse a temple, he can't hit you.  Does that make sense?  There are boss battles that I literally can beat in two combos...and...everything just happens to allow you to get through when things are crumbling all around you.  So there are elements that pull you away from the world.\n\nAlso, they didn't game test enough.  They actually did a ♥♥♥♥ poor job in my opinion.  The camera is all jacked at times, and quite literally the character won't do what you told it to do, because it didn't register.  Sometimes because of the jacked camera, you intend for the character to move one way but you move another.  Quite frustrating.\n\nAnother really bad design element, is this whole black glob thing that eats you up when you go through a corrupted fertile ground.  All it does is slow you down.  That's it.  What's the point?  The game is a lot more fun when you are just climbing absolutely everything without falling, or missing a combo.  It totally takes away from the experience.\n\nThe overall game is a positive rating.  There are issues.  I loved it because it was so original of a game.","August 12, 2015","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I enjoyed it more than the Sands of Time trilogy, actually.  It was a bit less cinematic, but there was an ease and a fun to the experience that the other lacked, particularly when you got bogged down in endless streams of enemies.  But make sure you have a controler.  There is one of the quick time events that is impossible to do with a mouse.  You have to click the left button as fast as possible, but at least my mouse won't pick up individual clicks that fast, so when those come up, I have to pull up the options screen find the binding for the action, switch it to a keyboard button, do the quick time event, then switch it back to the left mouse button.  It is incredibly annoying, and although I played an awful lot of the game (much more than the hour and half steam says, I think I was only one world away from the end of the game) I finally just decided it was too tedious to continue.","January 28, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The art style, even after 4 years, is gorgeous. I put off playing this game for a long time b/c of the PC v. not having the DLC that finishes the story--& yet I kinda dig the "F' life" ending this left us with.\n\nThe trial-and-error platforming using checkpoints can be mindnumbing, & I'm esp. referring to any sections that had the on-rails breath powers while dodging pillars and whatnot. Awful. Just awful.\n\nAll enemy fights were irritating delays between platforming segments. Restricted to one-on-one combat (even w/ bosses), you typically just push enemies to an edge or wall and insta-kill them. Collecting light orbs was good and bad.  Never difficulty, somewhat addictive; the bad comes from repeating segments after bosses, meaning much of the game is played twice on the first go-round.","June 9, 2012","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In the quest to rid the game of all potential sources of frustration, the low difficulty level is unfortunate collateral damage. A sweet love story, mixing humour and romance just right to enchant female and male players alike. Like in most new Ubisoft games it's necessary to accomplish the same tasks over and over again, but it's not as annoying as in other games. The unusual graphical style is beautiful.Prince of Persia is repetitive in more ways than one, though nevertheless still highly enjoyable.

Everything about this game is amazing. The world, platforming, adventuring, everything is on exactly the same level as in any of the Sands of Time trilogy installments. If you are looking for a worthy successor to our beloved Sands of Time games, this is it. Look no further. I should point out that combat, while certainly interesting and visually appealing, is not as diverse as it was in Warrior Within or The Two Thrones, but the quality of this game is such that you will barely notice this slight flaw.\n\nThe aspect of the game that was the most beautiful to me is the story. I can't describe how immersive it is, how rich and deep it is. And you will love the Prince's new companion, Elika, just as much as you loved Farah. The interaction between the Prince and Elika is beautifully done. Their banter, small talk, discussions... it will keep you captivated throughout the game. You will find yourself rushing to defeat their next enemy just so you could hear them have another conversation, be that a philosophical discussion or a simple chit-chat between a guy and a girl.\n\nAnd as the game progresses, the story will pull you in until the Prince's world becomes your own. By the time the game reaches its ending, both you and the Prince will find yourself enthralled by Elika's spirit and character that you will find yourself (both you and the Prince) profoundly affected by her and what she represents in this game's world.\n\nAnd then the end will come. I will not spoil anything. All I will say is that it will send shivers down your spine. And please, this is not something that can be experience in a YouTube video. For you to really feel it, you need to play the game. You need to bond with the Prince and Elika. You need to care for these characters, just like the developers meant you to.\n\nAnd then, once you play through the end, believe me, it will stay with you for a long time.","March 19, 2014","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything about this game is amazing. The world, platforming, adventuring, everything is on exactly the same level as in any of the Sands of Time trilogy installments. If you are looking for a worthy successor to our beloved Sands of Time games, this is it. Look no further. I should point out that combat, while certainly interesting and visually appealing, is not as diverse as it was in Warrior Within or The Two Thrones, but the quality of this game is such that you will barely notice this slight flaw.\n\nThe aspect of the game that was the most beautiful to me is the story. I can't describe how immersive it is, how rich and deep it is. And you will love the Prince's new companion, Elika, just as much as you loved Farah. The interaction between the Prince and Elika is beautifully done. Their banter, small talk, discussions... it will keep you captivated throughout the game. You will find yourself rushing to defeat their next enemy just so you could hear them have another conversation, be that a philosophical discussion or a simple chit-chat between a guy and a girl.\n\nAnd as the game progresses, the story will pull you in until the Prince's world becomes your own. By the time the game reaches its ending, both you and the Prince will find yourself enthralled by Elika's spirit and character that you will find yourself (both you and the Prince) profoundly affected by her and what she represents in this game's world.\n\nAnd then the end will come. I will not spoil anything. All I will say is that it will send shivers down your spine. And please, this is not something that can be experience in a YouTube video. For you to really feel it, you need to play the game. You need to bond with the Prince and Elika. You need to care for these characters, just like the developers meant you to.\n\nAnd then, once you play through the end, believe me, it will stay with you for a long time.","March 19, 2014","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I give Ubisoft props for trying something new with the series and I cannot flaw any of the artistic team that worked on this game. The writing is top notch and the voice actors truly bring it to life in a way that surpasses the beautiful visuals. It's a shame that both the platforming puzzles and combat are not more interesting or challenging. The platforming is Prince of Persia light and the combat is an attempt to revive the classic PoP combat which has many promising elements but ultimately completely fails.\n\nWhile some point to the fact that you cannot die as the problem with the game, the true problem is that there is no challenge. Being sent back to the beginning of the puzzle or fight you failed on would be fine if the puzzles and fights were interesting and challenging.\n\nIf you're looking for a game to play for the writing and story, this is a good title to pick up.\nIf you're looking for a good platformer or action game, stay away.","February 17, 2014","true","4.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/damagedan/recommended/19980/","damagedan","DamageDan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/damagedan/","243 products in account","If I had only one word to choose when describing Prince of Persia it would have to be this: Beautiful. This particular iteration in the Prince of Persia franchise casts aside its former self including combat, art style, and story formula, in favor of a completely new approach. In my opinion this change is for the better as the graphics and character development in the game are some of the best I have yet to experience in a Prince of Persia game.\n\nFrom the moment you start it becomes very apparent that the Ubisoft Montreal had a distinct vision for how this entry in the series would look and compare to the others. The art style is a mix of cell shading and realism. The vibrant colors of the characters clash sharply with the sand and stone environment making the characters seemingly pop out of the screen.\nOne of the more elaborate visual effects in the game is the abundant use of cloth physics. Everything that you would expect to be swept up in the wind gets blown around like Marilyn Monroe's skirt, and it works really well. It adds a whimsical feeling to the game when coupled with the amazing color pallet.\n\nSpeaking of color, this is why I would use the word beautiful for this game. Ubisoft utilized the entire color pallet with this one. Everything from pastel to neon is implemented so artistically and meaningfully you may find yourself stopping to smell the roses more often than you might expect. The environment changes as you progress and adds a sense of urgency to your mission to bring down the God of Darkness. As you accomplish this the land changes from dark and moody to bright and sunny. The change is animated and dramatic and always fun to watch.\nThe combat is paired with acrobatics nicely and they go hand in hand in terms of the flow of the game. One moment you may be wall running and the next you're performing a Triple Lutz with your sword over an enemies head. The rhythm of movement and combat is extremely well done and makes you feel very accomplished when you string together a long combo attack or a flawless parkour segment.\n\nIn terms of story Prince of Persia gets it right and wrong. While playing you can take a moment to talk to your A.I. controlled counterpart. During these brief exchanges you are given insight into the characters and their past. These optional dialogue moments provide for some of the funniest and most enlightening banter I have ever heard in a game. The problem lies in that they are optional. I don't want to even think about what this game would be like without having done all of the chit chat sessions. Voiced by Nolan North as the Prince and Kari Wahlgren as Elika, these should not be missed as they fundamentally contribute to the story and honestly it's a shame they are optional.\nThe story is pretty straight foreword so I won't go into too much detail in that regard, but it is engaging and entertaining throughout. As you play you unlock new magical powers that by the end of the game are all used in conjunction to pass certain areas. There are several puzzle sequences that, in a positive way, interrupt the game play flow. These puzzles require you to manipulate switches and levers in order to progress through the level and range in difficulty.\n\nBecause the game is open world, environmental hazards evolve as you chip away at Ahriman's corrupted Lieutenants. At the start of the game, traversing the landscape is pretty straight forward. As you progress however it gets a lot more tricky. Everything from pools of corruption to moving tentacle blobs hinder your progression and add a nice steady increase in difficulty. Before you know it you become an expert wall running, ledge grabbing, tower scaling, pole swinging, God crushing princess saving Prince.\n\nPrince of Persia is one of those rare games that allows the player a whimsical and uncomplicated vacation into another world. It refines the series and reimagines it into a beautiful new addition to the franchise. While there was an epilogue DLC released and a continuation story arc in the form of a handheld title, my only regret is that there wasn't a sequel to this wonderful Diamond in the rough in the form of a full game on console or PC.","October 2, 2014","true","11.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

While evidently, this game tries to make the characters more likeable; at it's core, it's a classic case of Ubisoft made something which is so bad, it's kinda good. Not saying that AC and PoP are bad games - I love both dearly - it's just faults here and there which make the player re-evaluate why they spent time and money on this.\n\nLevel and character design are the strongest points of this game; both adding another element of intrest to the fairly simplistic game. The game at it's core is just 20 jumping puzzles with 24+ boss battles, which the player grinds their way through, in order to progress, all with a varying difficulty. There are a few puzzles here and there, one of which almost forced me to rage quit the game, which extends the gameplay, and changes it up occasionally.\n\nIf you are considering purchasing this game, seriously consider forming a headcannon for it. You will enjoy it so much more if you do.\n\nAnd I still recommend it.\nYou all know I'm Ubisoft's ♥♥♥♥♥.","April 2, 2013","true","22.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arctiq/recommended/19980/","Arctiq","Arctiq","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arctiq/","578 products in account","My first thoughts when I launched this game is that this game has no in-game options menu. You have to change the options before you launch the game. I'm sorry, but that is a stupid design. If you need to test out resoultions for the game you will have to keep exiting the game. There is also a few minor complaints I have. First, there is a one-second delay for the menu selections. Kind of annoying but nothing major. Another complaint is the borders on the screen. Again, the game is still playable.\n\nThe story is nothing to write home about. A guy unleashes an evil demon, all hell breaks loose and you have to repair the world. Nothing really original. Not to mention the voice acting isn't very good.\n\nRight from the beginning you have a partner with you, some kind of princess these guys have been chasing. Now this is where this game goes downhill. Here's the catch: You can never die. Your partner always saves you from falling down a pit or getting hit too many times. There is no challenge from that.\n\nIn the first few minutes of the game you're introduced to the combat. You can block, some kind of air attacks, normal attack, and claw attack. Not too deep. Though, there is a combo system where you can use your attacks and your partners attack to unleash pretty cool and stylish combos. This gets very boring after a few fights. Another catch: You don't kill any people. They run away. Why? I have no clue. You can also climb and run along walls. These controls are really finicky at times. Though if you've played any Assassin's Creed game, it'll be kind of easy to get used to.\n\nThe graphics style is kind of odd. The characters are givin this semi-borderlands thing which doesn't look very consistent with the rest of the world. I kind of like it though.\n\nPros:\n-Graphics are OK.\n-Combo system is pretty neat\n-Controls are alright sometimes.\n\nCons:\n-Story isn't that great\n-Voice acting isn't great\n-Combat gets dull\n-You can't change options during the game\n-Climbing is like in every other action adventure game\n\nIf you disagree with my review about this game, I don't really care. It's my opinion. I know my hours of the game haven't been enough for some of you, but I got really bored of the game and I don't want to continue it.","January 25, 2014","false","0.8"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

It is Prince of Persia only in name and not in the content. If you regard it as a separate game, then no problem.\n\nGraphics feels really fresh and painted. The animators did it well - the characters look like they have just been painted. The colours are vivid, after healing the fertile grond you have the sense of achievement because you "unlock" painted portion of the map.\n\nSoundtrack is, in my opinion, exactly the thing one expects to hear in the Persian fairytale - expecially the main theme (which appeared very briefly in both WW and TTT). Also, the track during the plate tutorials is awesome, in my opinion.\n\nGameplay is fluid, after you learn the rules of combat, enemy form-shifting and surroundings. All the boss battles require different approach,especially, fights with the Warrior. Also, great thinking in the last Concubine fight. Knowing your surroundings is what counts towards...\n\nCollecting light seeds. If you know the rule how to thoroughly search each healed ground, it would be interesting, not frustrating. Basically, the formula is something like this: seeds that go along the way towards the fertile ground + seeds that are placed on EACH path to nearby fertile grounds in BOTH directions (2 or 3 different paths) + roughly 2-3 "tricky" places, each containing 2 seeds, usually one close to the ground and 1-2 on the way to different place (you have to look around - sometimes you just run past this tricky places, not noticing them) + power plate that does NOT correspond with the power needed to unlock this fertile ground and leads to 5 seeds. After applying this simple rule it was time-consuming, but relatively easy to achieve 1001 light seeds by the end of the game.\n\nDialogues  are sometimes hilarious. You get to know your surroundings, get to know the characters and their background. If you skip the dialogues, you might miss some essential parts of the plot, so the story would seem a bit repetitive and predictable. Pity that we do not have Epilogue on personal computers....\n\nAlso, it is intreresting to know that now the gods are real - Ormazd and Ahriman are acttual gods of actual religion, not created specifically for the game.\n\nI highly recommend this game, so don't pay that much attention to the name of the game and enjoy the gameplay.","April 6, 2015","true","13.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ahoopyfrood/recommended/19980/","ahoopyfrood","AHoopyFrood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ahoopyfrood/","366 products in account","While this game is technically sound and interesting visually it just feels... empty. You're trying to help a princess recover her city from an evil force that's been released upon it but the entire city is deserted, even when you cleanse an area it's still devoid of people. After a while it made me a little disinterested in actually finishing because it seemed pointless to save an empty city. Even the enemies wait to spawn in until you're close. Done right this isolation can work for a game but in Prince of Persia they don't play to that or address it in any way.\n\nSimilarly the mechanics are feel hollow as well. Mostly this is due to a yawn inducing combat system. For each of the four bosses (which you fight multiple times each) there is an OP combo that you repeat over and over until the fight is over and really the only move that changes is the first one between bosses. All the combos are available at the beginning of the game and you can look them up in the menu. Once again the emptiness rears it's head as you only ever fight one enemy at a time. The "free" running is actually entertaining at times but by the end of the game the lack of variety will begin to erode it. The non free running puzzles aren't bad but also don't break any new ground.\n\nThe visual style of Prince of Persia is, while not exactly beautiful, interesting and different. The cel shading/illustration style works for the game but doesn't look as good in-game as the screen shots and doesn't appear to be aging as well as you'd expect from the style. Probably the biggest disappointment in the visual aspect is the lack of those stunningly deep environments and landscapes from some of the previous games. There are a few but the visual style let them down a little.\n\nOne thing that has swung back and forth in the previous PoP games is the writing, especially for the companion, and it's one of the aspects that this game actually does well with. The dialog between the two is believable and has that good snarky humor from the early games. The princess is capable (actually at some points I wondered why I was needed at all. In fact the Prince needs more help from her than she does from him, in general) and has a real personality. But talking of writing leads to the games biggest flaw: the endgame. There was huge potential for this game to have a real, deep impact on the player. A chance to elevate itself as one of those games that sticks with you long after you've set the controller down. Instead you're left wondering why you spent so many hours doing the tasks you did. You could honestly cut from when the prince and princess meet to the final cut scene and have the same feeling of accomplishment. Here, once again, the worlds emptiness hamstrings everything else because a living, populated world would have at least left the ending the devs went with salvageable.\n\nIn the end I didn't actually dislike the game, a more appropriate word would be disappointed. Greatness was within it's reach but it seemingly didn't even try to grab on. Simply trying is all I'm looking for. If you're a diehard PoP fan or enjoy puzzle platforming then this is a solid entry but for the average player I can only recommend it on deep discount, and if you decide to pass you're not missing anything.","June 18, 2014","false","12.7"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

As a child of the Dreamcast era and a raving fanboy of Jet Set Radio the Prince of Cel-Shading offers a beautiful graphical presentation in one of my favorite styles, but graphics can only take you so far.\n\nFor being in the same name as one of the most iconic platforming series out there, Prince of Cel-Shading totally goofs the landing on its platforming gameplay. Controlling The Prince lacks any depth and the game's levels are literally linear pathways, offering virtually no exploration throughout the entire game. Not only this but the pathing done in the platforming is so tight and linear that you rarely even get to see how beautiful some of this game's landscapes are.\n\nAll of this is make /even worse/ by the inclusion of Light Seeds, these collectables appear when you complete a level for the first time and force you to go back through the level to nab them all. Since there is no exploration you just mindlessly complete the level a second time which is in no way more enjoyable than the first time through.\n\nthe combat mechanics are rather basic as well. The system is a 1v1 fight which was supposed to give more gravitas to the battles with regular baddies. Sadly, since you can kill an enemy by knocking them off a platform and the platforms in this game are tiny the fights lack the weight the game was attempting. Combat does get upgraded and gets better the further into the game you go but it's never something to write home about.\n\nSo aside from graphics what redeeming attributes does this game have? Character interactions. The Prince and Princess Elika have some of the most natural and organic conversations I've seen in a video game. Their banter never feels forced or hamfisted and their character develeopment happens more in the background than the foreground.\n\nSadly, this can't carry Prince of Cel-Shading as it crumbles under the weight of its own poor gameplay. It's a shame that what is beautiful about this game can't shine past its glaring faults\n\nPros:\n- Beautiful Cel-Shading presentation\n- Fantastic worldbuilding and landscapes\n- Some of the most organic character interactions and development around\n\nCons:\n- Borderline-offensive gameplay\n- Linear level design detracts from the beautiful landscapes\n- A rather basic combat system that does get better, but not nearly enough\n- The Light Seeds cause offensive backtracking and game padding\n\nfor a more in-depth look at Prince of Persia please watch my video review linked above.\n\n- Mr. u Suk","July 5, 2015","false","12.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I played all the way through it on the Xbox 360, then grabbed it for Steam when I made my bigarse PC conversion.\n\nBut the game gets my negative review for a couple reasons.\n\nOne: NO Steam features. No Steam Overlay, no streaming, no achievements, no cards, no nothing. Definitely an annoyance, but not the games most crippling point.\n\nTwo: It's age shows in its features. It uses a Launcher - pain already - and doesn't seem to have an available windowed mode. But most of all, V-Sync or a frame limiter must be turned on, or the games FPS will SKYROCKET so high during loading screens that it will freeze. Consistently. Every time you start a new game. I suppose this could be blamed on old age, but...\n\nThree: The CRIPPLING flaw here. It doesn't have the extra DLC content offered to the console versions. It's not the best part of the game by any means, but it IS extra content, it is a harder challenge and it is a little bit more story. Something this game does well, even if the DLC has little of it. This crippling aspect of it makes it hard to reccomend over a 360 copy, but combined with the lack of Steam integration at all makes it a no-go for me. I'm far past the point of refund, though.

Thank ♥♥♥♥ing god this game only cost me 5 dollars.\n\nThe list of what they did right to this game is shorter than the list of things they did wrong.\nSeriously Ubisoft, even for a 2008 title we'd expect something more. Especially after a legendary hit like Assassin's Creed was initially release in 2007.\n\nThis review is all I have to release the raging anger I have inside. It's kind of like releasing Ahriman at the end of the game. Oh, yeah. Sorry for that spoiler.\nBut SERIOUSLY. You'll be thankful I ruined the ending of this game for you.\n\nAdmittedly, like everyone - you think the game starts off kinda cool. Like oh, I wonder what kind of spin Ubisoft can put on the Prince of Persia series. Well the answer is total garbage. It's almost like they used the development of this game to solve virtually every problem they had developing the AC titles. It's like hey f*ck it, let's just have the absolute worst game mechanics, terrible script, awful voice acting, and literally only 7 recurring characters. PLUS, let's only have 4 levels in the game. Is this screaming SH*T yet?\n\nIf it's not, here's another reason not to play this game. It's 12 hours of your life you'll never have back. You could watch an entire season of The Walking Dead in 12 hours.\n\nIn actuality within the first 3 hours you'll absolute hate the fact that you're saddled with some whiney a$$ b*tch who literally, LITERALLY clings on to you after every move. I mean wtf were they thinking?! A game that should last 6 hours, lasts twice as long because you constantly have to wait for Elika to attach on to you, like an infant to the nipple. Oh, did I forget to mention the bragadocious, nauseating rhetoric between the two of these characters? It's more sickening than your very first valentine's love.\n\n-.-\n\nEverything, and I mean everything in this game is repeated.  Like its THE definition of repetitive. Every boss fight, every attack sequence. Same, same, same. Its utter bull$hit, there's no WHOA factor to this game. Nothing even remotely charming enough to hide the fact that this was probably developed by a bunch of pi$$ed off frenchman that had nothing better to do, because they weren't involved in the AC titles. It's literally the only excuse I can think of.\n\nI dont even want to talk about the final boss fight. It's just horrible. Literally unbelievable, there's not even a probable, sliver of chance that the Prince would walk away from it alive... and thats another thing. You can't die. You just cant. Elika will save you EVERY F*CKING TIME. Even if you want to die you can't. There are so many things you can't do in this game, it's almost like that was the most challening part. (In all seriousness even finishing this game is an achievement) you have no idea the patience it took.\n\nIf there's one positive thing I experienced playing this game, its the fact that Elika sarifices herself to imprison Ahriman and dies in the process. Obviously! I mean duh, you'd have to be an idiot not to get the hint. The f*cking ending was so over foreshadowed, that a four year old could have guessed it. Either way, she dies - roll credits. Just kidding - really I should have turned the game off after that scene.\n\nBut, in order to actually witness the finality, and true ending of the game, you have to keep playing. So you break all 5 trees imprisoning Ahriman, you transfer the light back into Elika, (cause I'm only assuming at this point there's no f*cking way the Prince is going to leave her dead, like there's no way he's not going to throttle the ♥♥♥♥ out of Elika's "enchanted" bits - like the guy lost all his gold, his donkey, his one shot at true love, or at least a hot one night stand right?) and then she's just like WHY?!\n\nYes, why you f*cking IDIOTS. Why?! There was no point to this game after 12 hours WASTED!! UGGHHHHH\nEven she's asking you why, you saved the world. You could have found your donkey, left the world at peace, let the annoying b*tch be dead and moved far away with his riches and courtesans. But no, in spite, the Prince just had to bang Elika, and that's why he saves her. Even though the world will now forever be in darkness; at least he gets to ♥♥♥♥ her.\n\nThanks Ubisoft!

Unlike the other Prince of Persia games, this one allows more freedom of exploration, though the downside of that is that the difficulty never really increases. Combat can, at times, be a bit of a chore, but once you get in the groove it, too, becomes a largely pleasurable experience, more akin to a simple 3D fighting game than anything else. All in all, I thoroughly recommend this game: it's one of my favourites.","November 2, 2015","true","31.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Worst culprit is a mandatory cereal-box-token-collection mechanic in-between 'levels' (such as they are).\n\nYou basically parkour around on a level with beautiful scenery, and you get a boss fight at the end of every level. There's real PoP platforming, this was before the horrible auto-parkour days of Assassin's Creed.\n\nIt's a basic game, both the climbing and the fighting is basically a glorified Simon Says, but it works, it's solid, and there's no intrusive gimmicks, no annoying busy work disguising itself as replay value, no generic AAA title stupidities or pandering. Looks and plays fine, as well, showing that you don't need Direct X 43 and a $3000 computer or 20GB Video RAM on your GPU in order to make a stunning and beautiful game.\n\nWas a solid title worth it's $60 price tag back in the day and it's an even better purchase today. Too bad the DLC levels are console exclusive and too bad Ubisoft abandoned the new plot to make more auto-parkour Assassin games.","November 15, 2015","true","9.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game hits me with a bit of nostalgia and the Prince in this game actually reminds me of Dante from Devil May Cry for being hilarious and egotastical.\n\nThe downside of it however, there's a huge lack of characters within' the game, huge lack of enemies as well. Some of the fighting and movement animations are pretty stale or doesn't look well at all (like the flying animation and when you parry the hunter's attacks) Some Audios within' the game are out of context or just sounded weird (like how Elika's moan like she just got a huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but suddenly her voice mutes halfway through.) The last complaint i have for it is how the ending of the story was. You don't get to chose to bring Elika back to life or to walk away. And the bring Elika back to life ending is pretty bad as well considering that our whole mission of the game was to stop an angry god from being brought to life only to release it for the sake of a person which makes the motive of the game kinda pointless.\n\noverall, i give the game a 6/10. It's good but just not good enough. I really hope they'll make a sequel to this game as well.","December 5, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Thank ♥♥♥♥ing god this game only cost me 5 dollars.\n\nThe list of what they did right to this game is shorter than the list of things they did wrong.\nSeriously Ubisoft, even for a 2008 title we'd expect something more. Especially after a legendary hit like Assassin's Creed was initially release in 2007.\n\nThis review is all I have to release the raging anger I have inside. It's kind of like releasing Ahriman at the end of the game. Oh, yeah. Sorry for that spoiler.\nBut SERIOUSLY. You'll be thankful I ruined the ending of this game for you.\n\nAdmittedly, like everyone - you think the game starts off kinda cool. Like oh, I wonder what kind of spin Ubisoft can put on the Prince of Persia series. Well the answer is total garbage. It's almost like they used the development of this game to solve virtually every problem they had developing the AC titles. It's like hey f*ck it, let's just have the absolute worst game mechanics, terrible script, awful voice acting, and literally only 7 recurring characters. PLUS, let's only have 4 levels in the game. Is this screaming SH*T yet?\n\nIf it's not, here's another reason not to play this game. It's 12 hours of your life you'll never have back. You could watch an entire season of The Walking Dead in 12 hours.\n\nIn actuality within the first 3 hours you'll absolute hate the fact that you're saddled with some whiney a$$ b*tch who literally, LITERALLY clings on to you after every move. I mean wtf were they thinking?! A game that should last 6 hours, lasts twice as long because you constantly have to wait for Elika to attach on to you, like an infant to the nipple. Oh, did I forget to mention the bragadocious, nauseating rhetoric between the two of these characters? It's more sickening than your very first valentine's love.\n\n-.-\n\nEverything, and I mean everything in this game is repeated.  Like its THE definition of repetitive. Every boss fight, every attack sequence. Same, same, same. Its utter bull$hit, there's no WHOA factor to this game. Nothing even remotely charming enough to hide the fact that this was probably developed by a bunch of pi$$ed off frenchman that had nothing better to do, because they weren't involved in the AC titles. It's literally the only excuse I can think of.\n\nI dont even want to talk about the final boss fight. It's just horrible. Literally unbelievable, there's not even a probable, sliver of chance that the Prince would walk away from it alive... and thats another thing. You can't die. You just cant. Elika will save you EVERY F*CKING TIME. Even if you want to die you can't. There are so many things you can't do in this game, it's almost like that was the most challening part. (In all seriousness even finishing this game is an achievement) you have no idea the patience it took.\n\nIf there's one positive thing I experienced playing this game, its the fact that Elika sarifices herself to imprison Ahriman and dies in the process. Obviously! I mean duh, you'd have to be an idiot not to get the hint. The f*cking ending was so over foreshadowed, that a four year old could have guessed it. Either way, she dies - roll credits. Just kidding - really I should have turned the game off after that scene.\n\nBut, in order to actually witness the finality, and true ending of the game, you have to keep playing. So you break all 5 trees imprisoning Ahriman, you transfer the light back into Elika, (cause I'm only assuming at this point there's no f*cking way the Prince is going to leave her dead, like there's no way he's not going to throttle the ♥♥♥♥ out of Elika's "enchanted" bits - like the guy lost all his gold, his donkey, his one shot at true love, or at least a hot one night stand right?) and then she's just like WHY?!\n\nYes, why you f*cking IDIOTS. Why?! There was no point to this game after 12 hours WASTED!! UGGHHHHH\nEven she's asking you why, you saved the world. You could have found your donkey, left the world at peace, let the annoying b*tch be dead and moved far away with his riches and courtesans. But no, in spite, the Prince just had to bang Elika, and that's why he saves her. Even though the world will now forever be in darkness; at least he gets to ♥♥♥♥ her.\n\nThanks Ubisoft!

As a child of the Dreamcast era and a raving fanboy of Jet Set Radio the Prince of Cel-Shading offers a beautiful graphical presentation in one of my favorite styles, but graphics can only take you so far.\n\nFor being in the same name as one of the most iconic platforming series out there, Prince of Cel-Shading totally goofs the landing on its platforming gameplay. Controlling The Prince lacks any depth and the game's levels are literally linear pathways, offering virtually no exploration throughout the entire game. Not only this but the pathing done in the platforming is so tight and linear that you rarely even get to see how beautiful some of this game's landscapes are.\n\nAll of this is make /even worse/ by the inclusion of Light Seeds, these collectables appear when you complete a level for the first time and force you to go back through the level to nab them all. Since there is no exploration you just mindlessly complete the level a second time which is in no way more enjoyable than the first time through.\n\nthe combat mechanics are rather basic as well. The system is a 1v1 fight which was supposed to give more gravitas to the battles with regular baddies. Sadly, since you can kill an enemy by knocking them off a platform and the platforms in this game are tiny the fights lack the weight the game was attempting. Combat does get upgraded and gets better the further into the game you go but it's never something to write home about.\n\nSo aside from graphics what redeeming attributes does this game have? Character interactions. The Prince and Princess Elika have some of the most natural and organic conversations I've seen in a video game. Their banter never feels forced or hamfisted and their character develeopment happens more in the background than the foreground.\n\nSadly, this can't carry Prince of Cel-Shading as it crumbles under the weight of its own poor gameplay. It's a shame that what is beautiful about this game can't shine past its glaring faults\n\nPros:\n- Beautiful Cel-Shading presentation\n- Fantastic worldbuilding and landscapes\n- Some of the most organic character interactions and development around\n\nCons:\n- Borderline-offensive gameplay\n- Linear level design detracts from the beautiful landscapes\n- A rather basic combat system that does get better, but not nearly enough\n- The Light Seeds cause offensive backtracking and game padding\n\nfor a more in-depth look at Prince of Persia please watch my video review linked above.\n\n- Mr. u Suk","July 5, 2015","false","12.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I played all the way through it on the Xbox 360, then grabbed it for Steam when I made my bigarse PC conversion.\n\nBut the game gets my negative review for a couple reasons.\n\nOne: NO Steam features. No Steam Overlay, no streaming, no achievements, no cards, no nothing. Definitely an annoyance, but not the games most crippling point.\n\nTwo: It's age shows in its features. It uses a Launcher - pain already - and doesn't seem to have an available windowed mode. But most of all, V-Sync or a frame limiter must be turned on, or the games FPS will SKYROCKET so high during loading screens that it will freeze. Consistently. Every time you start a new game. I suppose this could be blamed on old age, but...\n\nThree: The CRIPPLING flaw here. It doesn't have the extra DLC content offered to the console versions. It's not the best part of the game by any means, but it IS extra content, it is a harder challenge and it is a little bit more story. Something this game does well, even if the DLC has little of it. This crippling aspect of it makes it hard to reccomend over a 360 copy, but combined with the lack of Steam integration at all makes it a no-go for me. I'm far past the point of refund, though.

Yes, it's repetitive, yes, the story takes too long to make any sense, yes, the animation could have been a bit more polished, but it still is a pretty good Prince of Persia game.\nIts most important flaw is that Ubisoft tried to pass it as a PoP reboot, and fans couldn't accept that they should leave their favorite dark Prince for that light-hearted anime character. If it was called something like Prince of Persia: Orient and was promoted as a parallel game, it would have been greeted much nicer.","March 31","true","23.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

I found myself going "wow that looks gorgeous" throughout the whole game. The style features a wide variety of vibrant environments.\n\nThe OST in the game is also amazing and I did not find one track that I thought "meh I don't particulary like this one but I like the rest..." unlike most other games. The OST is for the most part orchestrated and fits with the vibrant graphic style perfectly.\n\nThe dialogue between the two main characters the Prince and Elika is for the most part very amusing and you ; I found myself grinning for long time after the actual conversations had ended. It consists of a lot of optional conversations which generally after you reach new area or have completed an action in that area. Other than the constant very tongue-in-cheek humour between these two characters, there are of course the serious talks that are related to the storyline and these are great too. The lore isn't exactly that original or creative but it's still decent and makes for a pleasant experience as you progress the story.\n\nThe story itself is not a linear story such as oh this happens then that happens all the time. It's moreso of there are four paths that you have to clear in order to get to the last boss. Each path has 6 areas (not including the intersection tunnels which really could be considered areas on their own I guess); you can do any of these areas you want at any time provided you have the powers available to progress those areas. Each area has it's own dialogue and specific OST track to go with it.\n\nThe platforming isn't generally hard but you'll find the bits that are "hard" are just literally a bunch of simple platforming but stringed together so that there is a higher chance of human error pressing the wrong button. As you progress each of the four paths you will get a new obstacle to avoid when progressing each new area. I personally like that there isn't anything that is "hard" that could possibly annoy you.\n\nThe combat seems a little left out really, there isn't much to it and many say that you cannot die, however this is false really because you can "die" it just plays a short cutscene when you are about to with Elika saving you. Once you "die", the monster or boss generally recovers most of it's hp so there isn't anything to complain about there. The combat just consists of blocking, deflecting (blocking at the right time) and then using combos which involve both the Prince and Elika which can do a LOT of damage to bosses.\n\n10/10 for me, best game I've played in a while. I did not find anything that really bugged me and the "problem" many people  say about the difficulty wasn't there for me as it felt just right; it just meant for me that I didn't have anything that I constantly lost to and it was a smooth playthrough that I enjoyed.

The focus here is more on platforming than combat, and the platforming action is satisfying and fun. The parts where you do have to fight can be a bit frustrating and button mashy, but they aren't a large part of the game. The controls are very responsive and the game ran maxed out at a silky-smooth 60 fps on my upper-mid-range PC. The art direction is pure eye candy, sporting a colorful pallete like something you would see in the 3D platformers from the N64 age, but rendered with modern technology. The characters are very likeable and the storyline is enjoyable, but unfortunately the game ends on a cliffhanger that was never followed up on (this is frustrating as it was one heck of a cliffhanger).

Playing this game lets you unwind and relax.\n\nThe major flaws of the game I'd say is that you can't reverse time and the fact that you can't die at all in the game.\n\nBut besides that if you're a PoP fan, you're gonna enjoy  this one.\n\nSeriously hoping they would bring back PoP.

I liked the price of persia sands of time and the warrior within and the 2 thrones were sub par games but not as horrible as this one.The graphics are cartoony and well done.The story line can be ignored,you have to talk with a partner character incessantly by pressing T to talk to her. The character of the prince is downright annoying and so is the other character elika. The dialogues sound like he is trying to be funny but feels pushed on.It is the most irritating dialogues I have ever heard. So I tried ignoring this part and tried to enjot the gameplay.But for ****'s sake the combat is so damn ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ filled with quick time events and a horribly slow moving prince.  ou just have to defend by hitting the button at the right time and then attack. I found this excruciatingly painful to bear.The platforming was a nice distraction and I really enjoyed it but the powers of the character elika ruined that too for me where you could speedrun and fly(I got to only 2 powers there are 2 others until I abandoned the game). it feels like those mobile running games which are god really awful.If it had been general prince of persia platforming it would have been good but these gimmicks ruin the experience completely. I could have powered through the game but the combat was so painful that I abandoned it . I just could not take those QTE based combat and the horribly awful dodge and attack system with a snail like moving character anymore. **** this game. And actually there is no way you can die in this game you can power through the combats but it would be very painful it would be like doing household things you know you will finish it but the process of doing that is not fun.Least fun game ever.NOT RECOMMENDED.Pure torture.","November 29, 2015","false","16.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The storyline was mediocre with a meh ending. The combat and some of the abilities (especially the flying ones) were very frustrating at times. Even the voice acting was not that great. Really, you couldn't get someone besides Nolan North to do the Prince's voice? It's such a unique and highly used voice now that it kind of pulled me out of the game.\n\nI think the most frustrating part of it all is this game really feels like it had a lot of potential. The artwork and graphics are quite pretty (except during the weird glitches). The music was quite lovely even though there wasn't much of it. It was a Ubisoft game without Uplay. Jumping around was even quite fun albeit a little repetative. I wish I could say more positive things about the game but even my compliments sound like complaints. I would only recommend this game if it was on sale and if you really really enjoy platform games.\n\n6.5/10.0","September 11, 2015","false","12.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is a glorified fetch quest. Imagine Mario where you have to collect every (or most) coins to open up new levels. There is no story to speak of (defeat Evil by collecting orbs) and the characters are flat. The fluid wallruns and leaps of the earlier entries are now scripted, clunky rubberbands. The combat is repetitive and boils down to button-mash/quicktime-event alternations. The game artificially extends gameplay by forcing you to repeat sections multiple times just to collect orbs that appear after you finish the level. This game may have been palatable on PSVita or something similar where the repetitiveness could be broken into 20 minute bus trips, but as such I cannot recommend.","September 29, 2014","false","4.9"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

Aside from that it balances on a really thin line between ok and awfull. I mean the game is REALLY PRETTY and I love the overrall designs, both the world and the chars. HOWEVER, despite how awesome some of the new platformer mechanics are, NO ONE should be forced to go through the same paths over and over and over AD ETERNUM!\n\nSo the game keeps a good job on entertaining but more often than it should, it makes you realize that you are wasting your time by forcing you to do some boring as hell task, aka collect orbs. Already expecting something like this to happen I collected as many orbs as I could without straying from my path throughtout the game, and it seems that wasn't enough. Sure I got my first power without a problem, but what about the second? For that one I had to collect orbs, since I barely had half of the required ammount! Screw this!\n\nThis sort of playtime extending technique is something rarely forgiven, and not always despised in two situations:\n\na) They are made interesting and hilarious (Saints Row 2 POOP AVENGER XD)\nb) The game is for some reason compelling, on either Story or Mechanics.\n\nPOP fails in both and at the same time unjustly compromises it's strong point: World Design. Would you pay to see the tip of the Mount Everest once? Probably yes. What about a second time? Perhaps if it was good. And what about another 20 times? HECK NO.\n\nPOP combat mechanics are ridiculous.\nPOP exploration mechanics are ok, but the whole no risk I'll just grab you back up thing kills the mood.\nPOP story is overral bad or at least lacking the urge to know more.\n\nPOP is an ok game, but it doesn't live to the Sands of Time Trilogy.

When you fight monsters in this game you mostly just hold the right trigger and sometimes press the blue button on the Xbox thing, whereas most monsters in the superior PoP required at least 5 players and sometimes 30 to even attempt.

Speaking as a huge fan of Assassin's Creed run jumpy, reach grabby, and death fally action, I think Prince of Persia is one ball of deep fried cow spunk. Okay, I might be biast, but at least I didn't curse, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it!\n\nMeh.\n\nAnyway, more judgmental comments only a bored sergal would go on about: One thing AC did well was drop the sense of linear gameplay. Sometimes in AC, there was only one path to climb up, but for everything before that, it was a sandbox of climby fun, full of rabid guards and violated hay stacks. Even then, ledges all looked different and required actual inspecting before leaping. Prince of Persia is a straight line. Yes, it is. Now, allow me to use my college educated logic:\n\nEvery single jump, climb, run, powerup, and flip is the same thing copypasted. There's no freedom. There's only one way up. One Path. One way. Oh hey! I am sounding like a cult now! But seriously, play it and remember what I said.","August 5, 2011","false","0.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kargor/recommended/19980/","Kargor","Kargor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kargor/","829 products in account","Well, to summarize things first: I've clicked on "Recommend", but you might\nwant to be careful. It's a somewhat weak recommendation.\n\nIt's a decent game overall, and it's also worth going through all the\ndialogue. The look is pretty, the music didn't annoy me -- in fact, I\nrather liked the rarer pieces.\n\nHowever, the game is split into 4 main areas, each with 4 sub-areas to\n"heal" and a final boss area. And this is where things get repetitive\n-- a lot. All of these areas work the same, repeating the same\ntemplate over and over again, although they look different to some\nextent.\n\nThere aren't a lot of enemies -- which is good, because you get the\nsame ones over and over again. In fact, by the time you get to the\nboss area, you've fought the boss 4 times already, and the boss area\nwill just give you a longer fight of the same, usually split into 3\nparts.\n\nI also consider the combat to be annoying, but luckily it's just\ntedious rather than impossible. Most fights need a lot of luck, and I\nfailed most quicktime events which means it drags on even\nlonger. Nonetheless, sooner or later, you'll succeed. The good thing\nis that you don't die; when you do, the enemy merely recovers some\nhealth but you can continue right away.\n\nI liked the lightseed-collecting parts a bit more. After you've\nfinished the objective in an area, the dark and grim area turns\ngreen and sunny, and you get to free-roam through it to collect\nlightseeds.\n\nThere are 45 of these in each area, but you don't need to collect them\nall -- you need 540 to complete the game, out of 1000 to be\nfound. Many of these are obvious and are just lined up along the way,\nsome are slightly hidden or require a bit of trial-and-error to\nreach. Nothing frustrating, although I had to just take a leap of\nfaith in a few cases as I just couldn't find the last seed in an area\nand started to just randomly jump into blind spots.\n\nHaving Elika around does provide the opportunity for dialogue, which\nhelps a lot to keep the game from getting boring. As far as her setup\ngoes, she's neither stupid nor comic-relief -- in fact, one has to\nwonder why she even bothers following you around. I do see a potential\nsetup concerning the end of this particular series, though, so that's\nok.\n\nAlso, you character basically doesn't change at all. During the game,\nyou (or Elika, actually) gains 4 powers, but these aren't like spells\nor skills -- they are more like keys to be used on specifically marked\nspots, which will then move you to another fixed spot in the area. So,\nby the time the end credits roll, you character looks the same and has\nthe same abilities that he had in the intro.\n\nThe story basically has two endings, with the first one being what one\nwould expect given how everything was set up. If you continue through\nand past the credits you get to play a part that could best be\ndescribed as setting the stage for the sequel -- which never\nhappened. I played through it, of course, but I consider it to be\nnon-existent as far as the story goes.\n\nSo, overall, if you are looking for a not particularly difficult game\nand don't mind doing the same things in slightly different scenarios\nwhile getting a decent but not particularly unusual story, this one is\nworth to consider. It also helps if you don't mind collecting some\nlightseeds.\nI got it at something like -80%, which is definitely ok :-)\n","April 3, 2014","true","31.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

After 12 hours of gameplay with minimal action in terms of gameplay and oc another 15 mins long ending credits sideshow which oc u cant bypass, i was left with mixed feelings for this particular title. In terms of graphics and platform gameplay this prince of persia title delivers like few games in its category. The puzzles are not that hard but they arent also very easy and the whole open map world is breathtaking especially when u manage to "heal" the area u are currently playing. In terms of action its very lacking and its minimal fights make it even worse. Repetitive monotone action once in every area, with the spam of 4 buttons makes that field really disappointing. All and all it felt like a game for more mediocre to lower age fanbase world. If u like platform games then u should definetely buy it.

This is a shining example of how far the 'norm' of game design has evolved.  Once an brutal game untimely demises, then a game about rewinding said demises, now a game where you cannot die whatsoever.  This is definitely a game more about an experience than a "game" in the traditional sense of the word; 'Passive Beauty' is a good way to put it.  There isn't any real urgency felt as you deftly navigate the worlds and bosses, but it lets you absorb more of the visual artistic grandeur that lies in this world.  The characters begin to show some semblance of depth and witty banter, but I wish the story-telling matched the artful execution of the world.  In the end it's as lighthearted as the death-free combat, which is too bad, because it's the weakest link in this otherwise stellar reboot.","December 20, 2010","true","0.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first glance, the ruins-crawling action seems to be on par with other standouts of the genre, but the gameplay quickly begins to feel repetitive and linear. The platforming is especially limited by the removal of the death mechanic - as soon as you miss a jump, you are transported back to the begining of the obstacle. This has a profound limit on the choices available to the player, as all paths are essentially reduced to on-rails quick time events. Combat is sparse and incredibly shallow, and since you can't die, it feels like more of a chore than anything. Most of the difficulty in this game comes from cheap tricks rather than clever design, and the handful of puzzles are all variations on using a lever to rotate things until they line up. Toss in an underwhelming story to boot, and you've got a frustratingly mediocre game.  C-","July 27, 2012","false","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

How this series has plummeted at times and tried to arise like a phoenix from the ashes. This game however, does have some merits. The Prince is not the same one from the "Sands of Time" series, but he retains the charm, witty, serious-undertone and proud if not sarcastic manner of his alter version in SoT. The gameplay is brilliant and the cel-shading adds so much flavour to the already classy and stunning visuals. The storyline is strong and you'll want to find out what happens in the end and Erika is cute but capable of holding her own. The combat is nothing like SoT but it's equally as fun, although some battles do get tedious very quickly. Sound? Oh god the music is gorgeous.\n\nHowever the ending was some of a shock to the system and I didn't like it. Also PC Gamers don't get the DLC which is equally as disappointing.

Once an brutal game untimely demises, then a game about rewinding said demises, now a game where you cannot die whatsoever.  This is definitely a game more about an experience than a "game" in the traditional sense of the word; 'Passive Beauty' is a good way to put it.  There isn't any real urgency felt as you deftly navigate the worlds and bosses, but it lets you absorb more of the visual artistic grandeur that lies in this world.  The characters begin to show some semblance of depth and witty banter, but I wish the story-telling matched the artful execution of the world.

At first glance, the ruins-crawling action seems to be on par with other standouts of the genre, but the gameplay quickly begins to feel repetitive and linear. The platforming is especially limited by the removal of the death mechanic - as soon as you miss a jump, you are transported back to the begining of the obstacle. This has a profound limit on the choices available to the player, as all paths are essentially reduced to on-rails quick time events. Combat is sparse and incredibly shallow, and since you can't die, it feels like more of a chore than anything. Most of the difficulty in this game comes from cheap tricks rather than clever design, and the handful of puzzles are all variations on using a lever to rotate things until they line up. Toss in an underwhelming story to boot, and you've got a frustratingly mediocre game.  C-","July 27, 2012","false","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The winner in this game is the original art, and soundtrack and Elika the improved companion character since the Sands of Time Series. The characteristic wall climbing was well done also. What was nice is that unlike the other PoP games which are mostly dark, this game starts in a dark world that is slowly revived and brought back to life as you play the game, giving you both a dark and a light side to play in, which gave the game an interesting and dynamic spin.

I get that they were trying to go new character, new kind of story, but really for all the differences between it and the feel of the games in the Sands of Time series, (which this is supposed to resemble), it really just has success by loose association. The platforming looks similar, but feels completely different. Plus, there is absolutely NO way to die. You have a partner with magic powers who will use them to catch you if you fall, push enemies off you before they can deliver deathblows, and pull you out of slime. This turns mistakes into minor inconveniences, instead of a need to restart. In the Sands of Time series, you could stop yourself from dying, but every time you use the Sands means that there's one less mistake you can make somewhere else. In this, Elika has seemingly unlimited power. This means you get unlimited restarts. You go back to the last place with solid ground. The enemy gets back the last round of damage you dealt to it. I think every element of this game is great and that they were all mixed together well. However, at the same time, it didn't feel like a challenge in the slightest. Even the Warrior, who you had to button mash to defeat and if you didn't send him over the edge he'd send you through the floor, never once stood a chance because you could survive ANYTHING thanks to Elika.\n\nOn the topic of the Warrior, let's talk about the battle system. You had five main enemies to face, and some smaller soldiers along the way. The battle system was rebuilt around the fact you couldn't die. It was a fun battle system, but again it wasn't the free-form battle system I had come to expect from Prince of Persia. Yes, there were combos, but you really couldn't choose your own battle style. There were only two combos that did large amounts of damage: 4 sword strikes, or elika, elika, grapple, jump, elika, sword. Everything else was either there to push enemies into things, or the combos were just too short for damage to add up. Ubisoft could make a killing on a game based around this concept, but I wouldn't call it a Prince of Persia game and the system needs major refinement.\n\n\nNow, for the second thing I didn't like about the game: Story. Until the final sequence at the Temple, I thought it was fine. The intro was a bit weak, but hey, not every game deserves a cinematic. However, this is Prince of Persia. Ubisoft has made the whole series around a theatrical experience, and then they suddenly killed it in this one. Again, I get they were trying to go new hero, new kind of experience, but, as much as I like to bash Call of Duty for not innovating, They at least know that people like to play games with the same title for the same sort of experience. They changed this one a bit too much from the Sands of Time formula. Anyway, back to my problems with the plot. Other than the intro and the ending, it was actually fine. You had four different areas to explore and you could do them in whatever order you wanted. The plotline was built in such a way that it didn't matter which one you went to first. That was nice. However, I had to restart the game at one point because of a thoughtless error on Ubisoft's part. It didn't matter which power you unlocked first. However, the one that you choose second pretty much has to be the one that lets you progress further into the same area you were just in. Which means that you have to face down one boss at a time, four, maybe five times in a row. They make him "harder" every time, but it doesn't make a difference because you can't die. I had to restart the game because I chose the wrong second power. The Hunter in my opinion was the easiest to defeat, so I wanted to save him for last. However, becaue I chose to fight him after gaining my first power, it meant I couldn't possibly get enough pickups from the areas I had access to to unlock the third power. This forced me to COMPLETELY RESTART THE GAME!!!\n\nNow, I'm gonna try and talk about the ending without any spoilers. The whole game (when I played through the way Ubisoft wanted me to) had a pretty nice flow. You couldn't really get lost unless you found a way to skip cutscenes. So here's pretty much how it goes: weak beginning, good flow, good flow, good flow, good flow, mostly stable climax, panicked platforming sequence, then WTF? As far as I can tell I didn't accidentally choose an alternate ending. Your unnamed character undoes everything you worked so hard for the whole game, and it's not even like one of those "rewind" endings. If it was, I might not be so upset. This was an ending where he saves the world, changes his mind, and then ends it. Thanks a lot, Ubisoft! I thought this was supposed to be a reboot. How are you supposed to return to a world that NO LONGER EXISTS????\n\nI had fun. I'd probably play again. I just couldn't justify this to someone unless they enjoyed this kind of plot.","July 26, 2014","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the art style in this game. Its not your everyday, traditional realistic 3D graphics nor the cartoonish 2D graphics you see. This has more of an artistic, comic book, 3D style to it.\n\nThere isn't a lot of battle like in the other POP games but I believe the story, characters, and artwork make up for that. This game has lots of parkour in it. But don't be afraid to fail. There is no true death in this game. If you mistime your job, fall of a ledge, or you run out of health, no need to worry. Your partner, Elika, will save you from falling and heal you.\n\nTry not to get too attached to the storyline because while this was supposed to be a trilogy, Ubisoft cancelled it (can't remember the reason why). There is dlc available for the game but it only available on the PS3 or Xbox 360. The dlc is also known as the epilogue. This epilogue picks up right after the game finishes and sets the storyline for the second game. You can find the gameplay and cutscenes on YouTube.\n\nThis game is fully compatible with a contoller. I would reccommend using the Xbox 360 controller because that is what the game commands are shown as.\n\nI played this game before I bought my Xbox 360 computer controller and I have to say that I was not disapointed with the keyboard controls. Unlike other games that have loads of commands to use this game is simple enough to play with the keyboard and mouse (I do not reccommend using the track pad to play this game). Once you know (and remember) which keys controls what command it gets easier.\n\nI never ran into any glitches/bugs or any compatibility issues. I was running this game on Windows 8 with 1.3 GHz. Which surprised me now because when I went back to look the min requirements for this game is 2.6 GHz. Course whenever I play computer games I like to but the graphic settings on low. So even when the graphic settings where on low I still got beautiful graphics. I had lag/decreased frame rate every know and then but nothing that ruined my gaming experince (remember I was running this with 1.3 GHz when it was supposed to be 2.6 GHz)\n\nOverall I give this game an 8/10.

Visually the game looks beautiful and artistic, but that is where the positives practically end. The story was a modest attempt at bringing something new to the series but undoes itself and everything the player did.\n\nGameplay: Marketed as letting you choose how the adventure unfolds seemed to be the main selling point for this game and is ultimately what causes a lot of the shortcomings you experience. compared to many games now a days (2015) the upgrade system is simplistic and adds nothing to the story or gameplay. you gain upgrades (total of 4) by clearing 4 areas. the upgrades do not add a layer of combat, ability or skill to the game but are rather plaques placed around the game that allow you to explore or reach areas previously unlocked and on a preset path. Unlike other games (i.e. Megaman series, Metroid series, or the more recent Batman series) in which upgrades were tied to the story, expanded your combat interaction and strategy when dealing with old & new enemies, as well as reveal previously innaccessable areas; Prince of persia sits content to make upgrades only usable in a small number of locations, and powers that have no real relation to the story or game (minus one power that lets you run along walls on a preset path, almost like a rail segment).\nEnemy types are rather simplistic and most of them are the same type of enemy with merely a different skin applied. Bosses offer little to know variation in how you defeat them, boiling down to: counter, strike, use "x", "b", or "y" attacks.\nThe goal of the game boils down to collecting "light seeds" to unlock the next upgrade, fight one of the same 4 bosses and move on to the next point.\nMovement (free running) in this game feels almost prehistoric with many actions feeling almost like a quick time event where you are just pressing a button instead of actually maneuvering around the environment. compared to many free roam game out there (assassins creed, mirrors edge) the free running and acrobatics in this game feel rather clunky and unpolished. add to this the fact that by the second area you have seen everything this game has to offer (minus the severly limited upgrades) you feel more like you're running through the motions than actually playing a game\nAll this is due to the fact that the game was designed for you to choose which of the four areas you wanted to explore first; and this is where the game gets hindered. Because the developers chose to provide a sense of open exploration, and make the world "open" they didn't change enemy types, difficulty or change much of anything in all 4 major areas. this failure to either not decide how to unfold the story or make a simplistic game was what lead to further downfalls. By the second area you are basically just rinse and repeating most if not all your actions. Mario 64 provided more gameplay and that game came out in 1996\n\nSTORY: The story is almost an a copy paste of the heroes journey at the beginning but provides almost no motivation for the characters and gives no growth to them throughout the entire journey; even undoing everything you had worked for by the end of the game.\nYou start off as some lone wanderer looking for his donkey (which apparently was carrying a load of gold) you bump into some woman on the run, and for some reason (because she's pretty I guess) you give chase and help her. you then stumble across a plot in which only you can help save the world from darkness. That is as cliched as you can get, not even a denial of the call, just straight into the action with no motivation or explanation of who these characters are and what drives them.\nEven worse is the dialogue throughout this game which proves to be repetitive, bland, and full of corny one-liners that make me hate the main character more than actually relating to him. Again because the world was made "open for players to choose their own path" some dialogue between the two main characters feels out of place, with dialogue that should happen later in the game happening early in; and dialogue later in the game sounding like they just met.\nThe ending is the straw that breaks the back of this camel, when you are forced to undo everything you had worked to accomplish during the game because the writers believed that at this point you felt invested/cared for the female character. They don't give you a choice, they make you destroy everything you worked for, and that doesnt work if you don't feel connected/invested in the story.\n\nVISUALS: the only upside to this game is the look. The change to cell shaded works well with the art style of both the world and it's structures as well as the look of the characters. The enemies have a stark contrast to both the world and it's inhabitants giving them an almost lovecraftian design.\n\nThats really it, of all it's downfalls the games only positive aspect is the visual style. everything else is a half-♥♥♥♥♥ mess of the designers not taking enough time to think about a varying sort of gameplay that would work well with "free roam" world they created.","August 31, 2015","false","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I gotta say right outta the start that yes, I am a bit dissapointed about the difficulty level.  The game series carries quite a legacy and reputation, the prince series was one of the few games that taught me to have fun with a game even when sometimes is infuriatingly difficult.\n\nMost people say that Dark souls gave them back something they really missed from 2D games, actual hard challenge, to me that game was "Prince of Persia 3D" (the Mattel one) it was so hard to advance and at the same time so adicting because of the combat system and the feeling of achieving something every level you completed.\n\nSo OK this one is easy, insultingly easy for any game actually (and more so for a PoP) since Elika (your partner) ALWAYS saves you, does not matter if you fall of a cliff or are about to have a sword jabbedd on your ♥♥♥ for sucking at combat SHE. ALWAYS. BAILS. YOU. And that is the main issue with this game, I dare say the only one.\n\nThe game looks great, the graphics are (to my liking) very nice and it gives a completely lively atmosphere. The combat system  is very enjoyable, it reminded me a bit of PoP 3D, and though you canot lose I loved the combos and coop with Elika.\n\nTalking of Elika, the BEST parts of this game are both related to her, the simple (but good) storyline and the small interactions and dialogues with Elika, they are lovable.\n\nAbout why I really liked the story (even though is quite straightforward) is the ending of the adventure. I wont spoil the ending, but I really loved it because it breaks a very known cliche in videogames and books in general and it earned my respect for that.\n\nThe interactions with Elika during the story and the scenarios are great, it builds up the character, make you really care for them and gives a lot of interesting tidbits of both the Prince and her. I also loved the small animations on they have during in the gameplay (like when the Princes carries her in the vines and ask her not to press his neck too tight, or when the prince catches Elika after climbing down a wall) those details really make the characters stand out and feel more lively.\n\nIn general I enjoyed the game but I feel I would have loved it if the difficulty level was upped a lot more and if the combat system added longer combos (relying more on reaction time) and more variable enemies (every battle is a duel, there are no mobs and they mostly react the same except for the bosses)","May 24, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was meant to lead into a series of games, but due to poor fan and reviewer rerception this didn't happen. I initially brought the game with some trepidation, but find the game an atmospheric, mesmerising experience. However there are flaws in the game.\n\nIn reviewing this I will try to avoid spoilers, as I want people to enjoy the story for what it is.\n\nThe game title is a bit of a fallacy, as the hero is a bit of a rogue in the story and does not seem to have any of the royal background of the Prince from the Sands trilogy. However while initially disliking the guy, as I played through the story he grew on me.\n\nThe background essentially is that during the opening "tutorial section" of the game an Evil god, Ahriman is "freed" from captivity and spreads corruption throughout the land. It then becomes your job to "aid" the Princess Elika in cleansing the land of corruption prevent Ahriman regaining his full strength and escaping the temple where he has been imprisoned.\n\nElika is a constant companion in the game. following you assisting in the fights and her magic powers are both a key to cleansing the "Fertile lands" of corruption and traversing each of the four main areas of the game. Each area is governed by one of four corrupted bosses. The Hunter, the Alchemist, The Concubine and the Gaurdian. Initially only four starting areas are available to you as Elika no access to the magic to access the fertile lands anywhere else. In each of the four areas, you are introduced the the Aforementioned bosses. After traversing the areas obstacles and jumps, and defeating the corrupted, Elika is able to cleanse the area which transforms the land from desolate wasteland to vibrant lush greenery, and activates "light seeds" throughout the specific area to collect. Collect enough lightseeds and you can return to the temple courtyard to activate one of four powers. This then enables to traverse deeper into the land to further cleanse it, and therefore reteive new seeds to unlock further powers.\n\nYou are not restricted in the order in which you unlock the powers, so essentially each playthrough can be a slightly different experience. This is due to the fact that as you progress against the four corrupted leaders, they gradually unleash other obstacles to overcome throughout the further levels. Once you have cleared all four sections of a bosses area. You are able to access a final fight with the specific boss. Defat all four and you return to the temple to finally defeat Ahriman.\n\nIt should be noted that although you need the four powers to access the fertile grounds, that you are able to traverse the outskirts of every area at the start of the game. This is required as the powers only access limited areas. Elika will tell you which areas as you ponder the power to use. As you clease the Fertile Lands, you eventually are able to teleport between cleansed areas to reduce travel using the map screen. The map screen will also allow you to set a waypoint so that Elika can use her magic to guide you should you become lost.\n\nThe "Prince" is an agile fellow, with a gauntlet to help him climb and slide down walls and traverse ceilings, and wall running abilities and jumping to boot. Couple that with Elika being able to assist him by boosting some jumps with her magic and saving you should you fall, or fail in battle. And he needs it to as the lands require all of his acrobatic skills to traverse the fantastical obstacles. This however brings to light the difference between Sands of Time and this game. In The Sands of Time you were traversing a Palace corrupted through the Sands of Time being unleashed. Each are felt "real" and that it could exist in a fantastical sense. The World of this Prince of Persia although well constructed is filled with floating islands and walls. A lot of the jumps require timed button presses to continue traversing the area. Fail and Elika will save you and return you to the first bit of flat land and the start of the sequence you failed.\n\nThe final bugbear is in some of the fighting. Generally your combos are ties to Sword, Gauntlet, and Elika's Magic. Dodge with the jump button is occasionally required, but can be hard to pull off. In general you block as necessary with a timed block allowing you time to counterattack. As the game progresses, the corrupted introduce powers that require you to learn and counter with the correct move. Failing to use the move will mean that you will be unable to damage the corrupted and Elika can even be taken out of the fight requiring you to manuever to help her recover. Some enemy attacks can only be countered via quicktime button events, including manic button mashing (specifically needed for one particular boss every time you fight him, but occasionally used elsewhere).\n\nHowever you are aside from the four bosses you are limited to essentially only one other main enemy combatant throughout the game, albeit combat in general is used sparingly. The rest of the additions throughout the game are new obstacles to dodge in the corrupted lands. Once cleansed the focus is re-traversing the areas to figure out how to get every light seed within the game. No new obstacles are introduced into the cleansed areas. Although it can be fun to get the lightseeds it can also feel boring as there is no further combat in the cleansed areas.\n\nSo why do I recommend it. Story and Visuals and Sound.\n\nThe story (penned by Rhianna Pratchett) is charming and compelling and a the relationship that develops between the Prince and Elika is a joy to behold. This is further enhanced by the visuals which use a cel shading technique throughour the game. The visuals are clear and detailed with a lot of effort put in. As you cleanse each area the corruption is replaced with bright colours, blades of grass evident with a multitude of flowers and butterflies. The interaction between the Prince and Elika is further cemented by little things such as the way they change places on a thin ledge, how he will help her up in certain circumstances.\n\nElika is not just eye candy however. she is truly an equal partner to the Prince. At no point is she relegated to escort duty, she never gets in the way and is crucial in the fights and puzzles as the game progresses.\n\nSound through the game is beautiful. My last playthrough was on Windows 10 with a Creative Soundblaster Z and a Logitech 5.1 Surround Speaker set. I was suprised to find the eax dll within the game files. (The game only supports Windows Vista or later). Previously I had played on an Asus Xonar DX on the same speakers. With my current setup, positional sound was very clear, the music which Arabian themed is mesmerising ramping up and settling down as the situation demanded. Some people clain to have issue with sound using Realtek onboard sound cards, but as I have always played the game using discrete soundcards.\n\nThe story, graphics and sound all combine to produce an incredible atmosphere in the game which compells me on. I am on my third playthrough still enjoying the atmosphere immensely.\n\nThat said, due to the mechanics the game does lack challenge. (I miss the days when you were actually required to stay alive to complete the game). You will fall, but Elika will always save you. This can make it frustrating in one of the last levels as you are in is constantly retried again and again. The resolution is limited to 1920x41080 maximum and graphic options are accessed through the game launcher. (There is a way to edit the Windows registry to enable you to play at 4k resolutions. and my last playthrough has been entirely at a 4k Resolution). Keyboard and Mouse or Xbox 360/ONE controller can be used to play the game and the keys are rebindable. (I recommend playing with a controller as this is my preferred method for this style of game).","September 3, 2015","true","48.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tymbal/recommended/19980/","tymbal","Daddy Bird","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tymbal/","85 products in account","'Big bad' God Ahriman is breaking out of his tree-prison and covering sidekick Elika's kingdom with 'corruption'. To put the cork back in his bottle you must bust out your very choicest pakour and cleanse all of the 'fertile lands' across the impracticality designed kingdom. For reasons that may or may not involve Elika's hip to waist ratio, our #Edgy Prince decides to tag along.\n\nYou're left to explore a relatively non-linear overworld. You're free to choose in what order to clear levels, but ultimately they must all be cleared and they all follow an identical structure. Climb to fertile land, fight boss, cleanse land. All too quickly, you settle into this routine, and the cycle goes unchallenged throughout the entirety of the game. So much so that you get diminishing returns; no matter how satisfying it is at first to return a fertile ground to it's prettier, greener version, after cleansing 20 areas they all begin to blend into one and each feels less rewarding than the last.\n\nLevels do their best to stand out. Sometimes the stage's boss will interfere, flooding the level with corruption, destroying structures around you or polluting the air. This would've added texture to the game but none of it ever has any impact on gameplay, and amounts to nothing more than decoration. Nonetheless, during these sections Elika and the Prince will dutifully play along with the developers, acting as though these facades are serious issues.\n\nYou can't die, Elika will save you no matter how bad you ♥♥♥♥ up. This completely undermines any potential tension. My play style soon veered towards recklessness as there was no reason to be attentive or careful, mistakes are never punished. On the other hand, this feature means the flow of the game is uninterrupted and creates a relaxed and pleasant mood when parkouring across the land.\n\nCombat is stiff. You never deal with more than one opponent at a time. The prince has suddenly lost all acrobatic ability and is fixed to the ground, confined to four attacks and combos. Compare to The Sands of Time wherein combat was more intrinsically linked to the prince's parkour abilities, and there was often space to get creative when tackling many foes. The combos look great though, and parrying attacks is satisfying if sometimes unreliable. When you screw up and need Elika to save you the enemy regains health meaning if you're struggling these fights can go on for a long time.\n\nOnce you've cleared a level, 'light seeds' appear across that level, requiring you to backtrack through the area once or twice to gather them. Despite the transparent effort to extend the game, the most immersive platforming takes place during these searches. Unlike the mindless tunnel platforming throughout the rest of the game, you must occasionally pause, examine your environment and plan your actions. You'll require exponentially more and more of these seeds to unlock four-colour coded powers that each unlock access to more fertile grounds. Unfortunately the powers are indistinct and unsatisfying to use.\n\nThe red and blue powers are identical and simply propel you from a suitably colour-coded plate to another point (usually another plate). The green power is the most fun, propelling the prince in a straight line up and across walls and ceilings, leaving it to the player to strafe left and right to avoid oncoming obstacles. By far the most obnoxious part of the game, the yellow power propels you into a stiffly-animated on-rails 'flight' around the map on the longest route conceivable to man. If you can see through the ugly obtrusive special affects that border your screen you must dodge corners of buildings and whatever other last-minute obstacles the developers decided to try to run you into. Other times it blissfully propels you across short distances... so works exactly like the red and blue powers again.\n\nElika handles world building exposition throughout a frequent scattering of cut-scenes, explaining what the different sections of the kingdom were supposedly used for before they became interchangeable slip'n'slides. Her descriptions are inconsistent, vague and fail to lend any much-needed depth to the setting. Character development based dialogue and exposition are confined mostly within optional dialogue snippets available at the press of a button.\n\nThis is an odd way round to do things since the narrative success of the story hinges on you developing an attachment to Elika, and so character development should be the primary focus. Regardless, initiating a conversation on your own terms is fairly immersive and I only wish that the feature had been used more widely to reduce the number of expositional cut-scenes that break the flow of play.\n\nThe final battle is much like any other stage, unsurprisingly. The game's narrative twist lies in (SPOILER ALERT) forcing the same choice upon the Prince as Elika's father when he brought her back to life at the cost of freeing Ahriman in the first place. This was a nice opportunity to allow the player to make up their own mind.

This includes the platforming segments. Slip up, and you just start again at the flat platform you where on a few yards away.\n\nAnd then there's the dialogue. Mighty God above the dialogue. The very being of spoken force is a golem of snark. Constructed from every snappy comeback and crappy action movie hero, it bores deeply into the sane mind eroding away every last bit of class and tact one could hope for in a game so richly layered in artistry. Artistry that only proved to be skin deep.\n\nAll this amounts to an ending that totally undermines the point of playing in the first place (Unless you fork over the cash for the DLC ending).\n\nDon't pick this up for more than 5 bucks or if you -really- like pretty environments and are willing to ignore the mountain of underwhelming parts.","May 14, 2013","false","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The storyline, platforming, and combat mechanics of all three previous games completely outshadow this installment in the franchise.\n\nThroughout my first playthrough of this game, my experiences have been completely and utterly repetitive to the point where I am almost falling asleep in my chair from boredom.\n\nOh! Lookout! I better dodge the enemies attack! But...wait...why should I? I take no damage from enemy attacks, and after a "killing blow", Elika, the companion to the prince, leaps to my aid (even when bound by corruption) and saves my life without any interaction from myself.\n\nWow, climbing this tower looks fun, and challenging! On second thought, no it's really not. I pressed Y on my controller 5 times and now I'm at the top, fighting the mini-boss, which I will now subsequently have to fight 4 more times, all the while being spammed by mindless quick time events, which are meaningless since I take no damage and cannot die even if i fail them miserably, or completely take my hands off of the controller during the fight.\n\nThe bottom line is, if you want to create a game for a mindless zombie that requires no skill and has no depth, then you create this game.\n\nIf you enjoy difficult gameplay with tense platforming sections, and a combat system that you can subtly master throughout play to pull off that extremely rewarding combo, please, go purchase Warrior Within. You will no enjoyment here.\n\nAt least there's Nolan North :/","June 13, 2014","false","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the art style in this game. Its not your everyday, traditional realistic 3D graphics nor the cartoonish 2D graphics you see. This has more of an artistic, comic book, 3D style to it.\n\nThere isn't a lot of battle like in the other POP games but I believe the story, characters, and artwork make up for that. This game has lots of parkour in it. But don't be afraid to fail. There is no true death in this game. If you mistime your job, fall of a ledge, or you run out of health, no need to worry. Your partner, Elika, will save you from falling and heal you.\n\nTry not to get too attached to the storyline because while this was supposed to be a trilogy, Ubisoft cancelled it (can't remember the reason why). There is dlc available for the game but it only available on the PS3 or Xbox 360. The dlc is also known as the epilogue. This epilogue picks up right after the game finishes and sets the storyline for the second game. You can find the gameplay and cutscenes on YouTube.\n\nThis game is fully compatible with a contoller. I would reccommend using the Xbox 360 controller because that is what the game commands are shown as.\n\nI played this game before I bought my Xbox 360 computer controller and I have to say that I was not disapointed with the keyboard controls. Unlike other games that have loads of commands to use this game is simple enough to play with the keyboard and mouse (I do not reccommend using the track pad to play this game). Once you know (and remember) which keys controls what command it gets easier.\n\nI never ran into any glitches/bugs or any compatibility issues. I was running this game on Windows 8 with 1.3 GHz. Which surprised me now because when I went back to look the min requirements for this game is 2.6 GHz. Course whenever I play computer games I like to but the graphic settings on low. So even when the graphic settings where on low I still got beautiful graphics. I had lag/decreased frame rate every know and then but nothing that ruined my gaming experince (remember I was running this with 1.3 GHz when it was supposed to be 2.6 GHz)\n\nOverall I give this game an 8/10.

The lead characters are charismatic and their relationship grows in a nice and funny way, the dialogs are fun (the guessing game is really funny) and the story is interesting. The environments can sometimes be very lonely, even a bit depressing when you're exploring them while they're corrupted. Though I prefer Warrior Within's combat system, I think this game's system works well in its own purpose. The "no-death" thing is an exageration in my opinion, since you DO "die" in this game - the only difference is that the game does not punish you making you do a big part of the way back to where you were, putting you right back to the last ground you stood before falling, for example. There's a lot to explore and nice puzzles, too.\n\nBUT...\nIf you like a harder and challenging game, it may disappoint you. If you're expecting for more action like in PoP:WW, it may also disappoint you. If you're a collector like me and likes to complete and/or collect the most possible in a game, know that collecting all the light seeds won't reward you in any way. And though I like the characters and especially the dynamics between them, you won't (as far as I remember) learn much about the hero and why is he the protagonist of a game called "PRINCE of Persia".\n\nBut the most disappointing point - that may even make you angry about the game - is the fact that it does not have an ending. Well, it does, but it seems planned for leading to a continuation, but unlike in WW, which even making way for a continuation, its ending closes the story within that game itself, here, you'll probably feel very angry about the choices the hero makes - and the game just doesn't let you do any other way. The XBOX 360 version has a DLC that's supposed to close the story but doesn't quite do it, just leading to another "cliffhanger" apparently, and the PC version doesn't even have this DLC.\nWhen I finished the game for the first time (not having all the light seeds) I even thought if I picked up the rest of the seeds I'd unlock some true ending (like in WW when you had the water sword before fighting the last boss), I was totally wrong.\n\nTo conclude: if you want a beautiful, fun and not so hard exploration game with nice characters and dialogs, buy it. You'll probably like it. But beware the ending will make you ask "WHY???" and be mad about being kind of ripped-off of your money for an incomplete story, so you might want to wait for some sale to buy it.","March 21, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is divided up between two different characters. One that you directly control, the Prince, and the other that is a semi-controlled, support character, Elika. As for the gameplay itself, it is divided up into two sections: Platforming, and combat. The platforming is pretty much what you would expect from a 3D platformer, but at a more rhythmic, slower pace than a blisteringly fast one like most 3D platfomers out there. The combat more so resembles that of 3D fighting games such as Soul Calibur than what you would expect from a 3D action game. Yet just like the platfoming itself, the combat has a strict rhythmic combo system that makes it all come together, and a joy, when your combos string together properly. Besides the two main sections of the game, you also have the task of collecting the sole in-game collectibles called "light seeds". These light seeds more or less act as experience points: Unlocking new abilities, new areas, as well as progressing the overall story. While it may be tedious at times for those who don't enjoy collecting, it isn't too bad because of the game's excellent platforming making it a pleasure just to move around. The last noteworthy thing is the game's superb graphical style. Even today, in 2014, the game still looks absolutely jaw-dropping with an excellent artistic direction that makes the game looks almost like that of a living, breathing, painting. The same praise can be given to the game's soundtrack as well with it's relaxing scores, to the more active ones.\n\nOverall, in my opinion, Prince of Persia (2008) is an excellent game in every sense of the word, and if you don't mind an easier, more relaxing game than it's predecessors, then there is a lot to love here. Yet even if the toned-down difficulty should turn you off, it still shouldn't deter you entirely from what is an excellent experience. Highly recommended.","April 18, 2014","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I stopped playing it for a while, saw this game on sale and thought "hey, i liked this game, I guess I'll pick up on it again" and I quickly remembered after an hour of gameplay why I stopped playing this in the first place. But first let me adress why I got sucked in.\n\nThe characters are very well done. The protsgonist looks cool, fights cool, and probaly smells cool. His assistant is a ...uuh... mage magic lady that magics stuff and magics enemies and magics you to save you and help you get across certain areas. Thats awesome.\n\nCombat is interesting, I really liked it and its one of the things that really dragged me into the game. You can switch up what kinds of moves to make, and do different combos at your command. Swing your sword, grapple the bad guys, throw them up in the air and have magic mage lady...uh...magic them! Sounds good so far eh?\n\nWorld Exploration killed it. After you beat the tutorial part, you can ask magic lady to show you the path to the boss, which is very usefull considering you can veer off your path easily and go in circles without her help.\n\nBUT once you beat this boss, that helpful guide option is no longer available to you, which destroyed the game for me. I climbed and fought and ran and fought and climbed some more with more climbing and a few wall jumps here and there and before I knew it I spent almost an hour running in a giant circle, with fighting 5-6 enemies in between. Realizing that I just threw away an hour of just climbing obsticals assasins creed style (the climbing and obsticals are VERY simular) with a minute long fight in between, I felt dissapointed. I could've usied that time to save starving African children.\n\nOverall  6/10","April 19, 2014","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

How this series has plummeted at times and tried to arise like a phoenix from the ashes. This game however, does have some merits. The Prince is not the same one from the "Sands of Time" series, but he retains the charm, witty, serious-undertone and proud if not sarcastic manner of his alter version in SoT. The gameplay is brilliant and the cel-shading adds so much flavour to the already classy and stunning visuals. The storyline is strong and you'll want to find out what happens in the end and Erika is cute but capable of holding her own. The combat is nothing like SoT but it's equally as fun, although some battles do get tedious very quickly. Sound? Oh god the music is gorgeous.\n\nHowever the ending was some of a shock to the system and I didn't like it. Also PC Gamers don't get the DLC which is equally as disappointing. Ubisoft didn't follow up on this game so the game is just sitting there making no sense. Overall, nice game but buy the SoT series.

That glorious felling of being pulled into a great adventure beyond your imagination? Then treasure it and don't let your brain overwrite it by this game.\nWhile bearing the name of the good old running, jumping, climbing trees with occasional monster fight game it is no like it. You are playing as a thief, badly written, pseudo-funny thief, who got lost in a sandstorm and runs in to a girl , magical girl, who is a princes of totally made up kingdom with absolutely overdone looking architecture which looks like paintings that have all been draw with one move  making spirals and more spirals every time... and because you are a bad thief, you decide to help her. So You must save the kingdom from the darkness by finding the four bosses, defeating them over and over with no significant change of environment throughout the whole game.\nDo You like collectables? When you have to collect thousands pieces of something just to gain reward, then guess what. You can't finish this game without collecting all the thousand pieces of something, because You need them to unlock a way to get to the bosses. But there is nothing else to do either because there is absolutely minimum of story. And only distraction while running through the plain wasteland of the game map are the conversation between prince and the magical girl, so poorly written that You'll stop paying attention to them after 5 seconds. In comparison with previous instalments of the Prince  the running, jumping, climbing trees is much better in this one. It has been made faster and bit more vivid, but the fact that environment does not change throughout the whole game makes that totally pointless. The time powers are gone, replaced by spiderman wall running, and even when we knew that not every prince of Persia must control time it seems kind of silly that every time you fall the magical girl pulls you back up from the midair like nothing. Battle system is even more boring, allowing you fight only one enemy at the time with no acrobatic kill moves making it only more painfull.\n\nDo Yourself a favour, don't buy it. Go play Sands of Time. And if You want to run, jump and climb trees like this thief-prince, The Forgotten Sands are still a better option than this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tymbal/recommended/19980/","tymbal","Daddy Bird","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tymbal/","85 products in account","'Big bad' God Ahriman is breaking out of his tree-prison and covering sidekick Elika's kingdom with 'corruption'. To put the cork back in his bottle you must bust out your very choicest pakour and cleanse all of the 'fertile lands' across the impracticality designed kingdom. For reasons that may or may not involve Elika's hip to waist ratio, our #Edgy Prince decides to tag along.\n\nYou're left to explore a relatively non-linear overworld. You're free to choose in what order to clear levels, but ultimately they must all be cleared and they all follow an identical structure. Climb to fertile land, fight boss, cleanse land. All too quickly, you settle into this routine, and the cycle goes unchallenged throughout the entirety of the game. So much so that you get diminishing returns; no matter how satisfying it is at first to return a fertile ground to it's prettier, greener version, after cleansing 20 areas they all begin to blend into one and each feels less rewarding than the last.\n\nLevels do their best to stand out. Sometimes the stage's boss will interfere, flooding the level with corruption, destroying structures around you or polluting the air. This would've added texture to the game but none of it ever has any impact on gameplay, and amounts to nothing more than decoration. Nonetheless, during these sections Elika and the Prince will dutifully play along with the developers, acting as though these facades are serious issues.\n\nYou can't die, Elika will save you no matter how bad you ♥♥♥♥ up. This completely undermines any potential tension. My play style soon veered towards recklessness as there was no reason to be attentive or careful, mistakes are never punished. On the other hand, this feature means the flow of the game is uninterrupted and creates a relaxed and pleasant mood when parkouring across the land.\n\nCombat is stiff. You never deal with more than one opponent at a time. The prince has suddenly lost all acrobatic ability and is fixed to the ground, confined to four attacks and combos. Compare to The Sands of Time wherein combat was more intrinsically linked to the prince's parkour abilities, and there was often space to get creative when tackling many foes. The combos look great though, and parrying attacks is satisfying if sometimes unreliable. When you screw up and need Elika to save you the enemy regains health meaning if you're struggling these fights can go on for a long time.\n\nOnce you've cleared a level, 'light seeds' appear across that level, requiring you to backtrack through the area once or twice to gather them. Despite the transparent effort to extend the game, the most immersive platforming takes place during these searches. Unlike the mindless tunnel platforming throughout the rest of the game, you must occasionally pause, examine your environment and plan your actions. You'll require exponentially more and more of these seeds to unlock four-colour coded powers that each unlock access to more fertile grounds. Unfortunately the powers are indistinct and unsatisfying to use.\n\nThe red and blue powers are identical and simply propel you from a suitably colour-coded plate to another point (usually another plate). The green power is the most fun, propelling the prince in a straight line up and across walls and ceilings, leaving it to the player to strafe left and right to avoid oncoming obstacles. By far the most obnoxious part of the game, the yellow power propels you into a stiffly-animated on-rails 'flight' around the map on the longest route conceivable to man. If you can see through the ugly obtrusive special affects that border your screen you must dodge corners of buildings and whatever other last-minute obstacles the developers decided to try to run you into. Other times it blissfully propels you across short distances... so works exactly like the red and blue powers again.\n\nElika handles world building exposition throughout a frequent scattering of cut-scenes, explaining what the different sections of the kingdom were supposedly used for before they became interchangeable slip'n'slides. Her descriptions are inconsistent, vague and fail to lend any much-needed depth to the setting. Character development based dialogue and exposition are confined mostly within optional dialogue snippets available at the press of a button.\n\nThis is an odd way round to do things since the narrative success of the story hinges on you developing an attachment to Elika, and so character development should be the primary focus. Regardless, initiating a conversation on your own terms is fairly immersive and I only wish that the feature had been used more widely to reduce the number of expositional cut-scenes that break the flow of play.\n\nThe final battle is much like any other stage, unsurprisingly. The game's narrative twist lies in (SPOILER ALERT) forcing the same choice upon the Prince as Elika's father when he brought her back to life at the cost of freeing Ahriman in the first place. This was a nice opportunity to allow the player to make up their own mind. However, the Prince decides that getting his ♥♥♥♥ wet is the prime directive and the game ends with a disappointing fizzle as you're forced to walk around doing some tree-prison gardening and undoing everything you've achieved in the space of a few minutes. (SPOILERS END HERE)\n\nApparently there was DLC for the console versions which layered an additional unsatisfying ending over the top in a desperate attempt to reach for a conclusion, but they didn't release that on PC so ♥♥♥♥ 'em.","January 27, 2014","false","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The original classic, Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones, and this one. They are pretty good 3D Platformer Puzzle games but there are a couple flaws.  The storyline is decent but isn't going to win any awards. Combat is lackluster with the exception of Boss fights which are interesting the first couple times you run through.  The puzzles are more an exercise of your platformer ability than your reasoning (which is a shame - I'd like more complex puzzles).  But the games still manage to be pretty good (at least the three that I listed). Of the three I'd say Two Thrones is the best simply because it introduces a new mechanic that really changes the game and thus makes it more interesting.","August 25, 2013","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This includes the platforming segments. Slip up, and you just start again at the flat platform you where on a few yards away.\n\nAnd then there's the dialogue. Mighty God above the dialogue. The very being of spoken force is a golem of snark. Constructed from every snappy comeback and crappy action movie hero, it bores deeply into the sane mind eroding away every last bit of class and tact one could hope for in a game so richly layered in artistry. Artistry that only proved to be skin deep.\n\nAll this amounts to an ending that totally undermines the point of playing in the first place (Unless you fork over the cash for the DLC ending).\n\nDon't pick this up for more than 5 bucks or if you -really- like pretty environments and are willing to ignore the mountain of underwhelming parts.","May 14, 2013","false","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Visually the game looks beautiful and artistic, but that is where the positives practically end. The story was a modest attempt at bringing something new to the series but undoes itself and everything the player did.\n\nGameplay: Marketed as letting you choose how the adventure unfolds seemed to be the main selling point for this game and is ultimately what causes a lot of the shortcomings you experience. compared to many games now a days (2015) the upgrade system is simplistic and adds nothing to the story or gameplay. you gain upgrades (total of 4) by clearing 4 areas. the upgrades do not add a layer of combat, ability or skill to the game but are rather plaques placed around the game that allow you to explore or reach areas previously unlocked and on a preset path. Unlike other games (i.e. Megaman series, Metroid series, or the more recent Batman series) in which upgrades were tied to the story, expanded your combat interaction and strategy when dealing with old & new enemies, as well as reveal previously innaccessable areas; Prince of persia sits content to make upgrades only usable in a small number of locations, and powers that have no real relation to the story or game (minus one power that lets you run along walls on a preset path, almost like a rail segment).\nEnemy types are rather simplistic and most of them are the same type of enemy with merely a different skin applied. Bosses offer little to know variation in how you defeat them, boiling down to: counter, strike, use "x", "b", or "y" attacks.\nThe goal of the game boils down to collecting "light seeds" to unlock the next upgrade, fight one of the same 4 bosses and move on to the next point.\nMovement (free running) in this game feels almost prehistoric with many actions feeling almost like a quick time event where you are just pressing a button instead of actually maneuvering around the environment. compared to many free roam game out there (assassins creed, mirrors edge) the free running and acrobatics in this game feel rather clunky and unpolished. add to this the fact that by the second area you have seen everything this game has to offer (minus the severly limited upgrades) you feel more like you're running through the motions than actually playing a game\nAll this is due to the fact that the game was designed for you to choose which of the four areas you wanted to explore first; and this is where the game gets hindered. Because the developers chose to provide a sense of open exploration, and make the world "open" they didn't change enemy types, difficulty or change much of anything in all 4 major areas. this failure to either not decide how to unfold the story or make a simplistic game was what lead to further downfalls. By the second area you are basically just rinse and repeating most if not all your actions. Mario 64 provided more gameplay and that game came out in 1996\n\nSTORY: The story is almost an a copy paste of the heroes journey at the beginning but provides almost no motivation for the characters and gives no growth to them throughout the entire journey; even undoing everything you had worked for by the end of the game.\nYou start off as some lone wanderer looking for his donkey (which apparently was carrying a load of gold) you bump into some woman on the run, and for some reason (because she's pretty I guess) you give chase and help her. you then stumble across a plot in which only you can help save the world from darkness. That is as cliched as you can get, not even a denial of the call, just straight into the action with no motivation or explanation of who these characters are and what drives them.\nEven worse is the dialogue throughout this game which proves to be repetitive, bland, and full of corny one-liners that make me hate the main character more than actually relating to him. Again because the world was made "open for players to choose their own path" some dialogue between the two main characters feels out of place, with dialogue that should happen later in the game happening early in; and dialogue later in the game sounding like they just met.\nThe ending is the straw that breaks the back of this camel, when you are forced to undo everything you had worked to accomplish during the game because the writers believed that at this point you felt invested/cared for the female character. They don't give you a choice, they make you destroy everything you worked for, and that doesnt work if you don't feel connected/invested in the story.\n\nVISUALS: the only upside to this game is the look. The change to cell shaded works well with the art style of both the world and it's structures as well as the look of the characters. The enemies have a stark contrast to both the world and it's inhabitants giving them an almost lovecraftian design.\n\nThats really it, of all it's downfalls the games only positive aspect is the visual style. everything else is a half-♥♥♥♥♥ mess of the designers not taking enough time to think about a varying sort of gameplay that would work well with "free roam" world they created.","August 31, 2015","false","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was meant to lead into a series of games, but due to poor fan and reviewer rerception this didn't happen. I initially brought the game with some trepidation, but find the game an atmospheric, mesmerising experience. However there are flaws in the game.\n\nIn reviewing this I will try to avoid spoilers, as I want people to enjoy the story for what it is.\n\nThe game title is a bit of a fallacy, as the hero is a bit of a rogue in the story and does not seem to have any of the royal background of the Prince from the Sands trilogy. However while initially disliking the guy, as I played through the story he grew on me.\n\nThe background essentially is that during the opening "tutorial section" of the game an Evil god, Ahriman is "freed" from captivity and spreads corruption throughout the land. It then becomes your job to "aid" the Princess Elika in cleansing the land of corruption prevent Ahriman regaining his full strength and escaping the temple where he has been imprisoned.\n\nElika is a constant companion in the game. following you assisting in the fights and her magic powers are both a key to cleansing the "Fertile lands" of corruption and traversing each of the four main areas of the game. Each area is governed by one of four corrupted bosses. The Hunter, the Alchemist, The Concubine and the Gaurdian. Initially only four starting areas are available to you as Elika no access to the magic to access the fertile lands anywhere else. In each of the four areas, you are introduced the the Aforementioned bosses. After traversing the areas obstacles and jumps, and defeating the corrupted, Elika is able to cleanse the area which transforms the land from desolate wasteland to vibrant lush greenery, and activates "light seeds" throughout the specific area to collect. Collect enough lightseeds and you can return to the temple courtyard to activate one of four powers. This then enables to traverse deeper into the land to further cleanse it, and therefore reteive new seeds to unlock further powers.\n\nYou are not restricted in the order in which you unlock the powers, so essentially each playthrough can be a slightly different experience. This is due to the fact that as you progress against the four corrupted leaders, they gradually unleash other obstacles to overcome throughout the further levels. Once you have cleared all four sections of a bosses area. You are able to access a final fight with the specific boss. Defat all four and you return to the temple to finally defeat Ahriman.\n\nIt should be noted that although you need the four powers to access the fertile grounds, that you are able to traverse the outskirts of every area at the start of the game. This is required as the powers only access limited areas. Elika will tell you which areas as you ponder the power to use. As you clease the Fertile Lands, you eventually are able to teleport between cleansed areas to reduce travel using the map screen. The map screen will also allow you to set a waypoint so that Elika can use her magic to guide you should you become lost.\n\nThe "Prince" is an agile fellow, with a gauntlet to help him climb and slide down walls and traverse ceilings, and wall running abilities and jumping to boot. Couple that with Elika being able to assist him by boosting some jumps with her magic and saving you should you fall, or fail in battle. And he needs it to as the lands require all of his acrobatic skills to traverse the fantastical obstacles. This however brings to light the difference between Sands of Time and this game. In The Sands of Time you were traversing a Palace corrupted through the Sands of Time being unleashed. Each are felt "real" and that it could exist in a fantastical sense. The World of this Prince of Persia although well constructed is filled with floating islands and walls. A lot of the jumps require timed button presses to continue traversing the area. Fail and Elika will save you and return you to the first bit of flat land and the start of the sequence you failed.\n\nThe final bugbear is in some of the fighting. Generally your combos are ties to Sword, Gauntlet, and Elika's Magic. Dodge with the jump button is occasionally required, but can be hard to pull off. In general you block as necessary with a timed block allowing you time to counterattack. As the game progresses, the corrupted introduce powers that require you to learn and counter with the correct move. Failing to use the move will mean that you will be unable to damage the corrupted and Elika can even be taken out of the fight requiring you to manuever to help her recover. Some enemy attacks can only be countered via quicktime button events, including manic button mashing (specifically needed for one particular boss every time you fight him, but occasionally used elsewhere).\n\nHowever you are aside from the four bosses you are limited to essentially only one other main enemy combatant throughout the game, albeit combat in general is used sparingly. The rest of the additions throughout the game are new obstacles to dodge in the corrupted lands. Once cleansed the focus is re-traversing the areas to figure out how to get every light seed within the game. No new obstacles are introduced into the cleansed areas. Although it can be fun to get the lightseeds it can also feel boring as there is no further combat in the cleansed areas.\n\nSo why do I recommend it. Story and Visuals and Sound.\n\nThe story (penned by Rhianna Pratchett) is charming and compelling and a the relationship that develops between the Prince and Elika is a joy to behold. This is further enhanced by the visuals which use a cel shading technique throughour the game. The visuals are clear and detailed with a lot of effort put in. As you cleanse each area the corruption is replaced with bright colours, blades of grass evident with a multitude of flowers and butterflies. The interaction between the Prince and Elika is further cemented by little things such as the way they change places on a thin ledge, how he will help her up in certain circumstances.\n\nElika is not just eye candy however. she is truly an equal partner to the Prince. At no point is she relegated to escort duty, she never gets in the way and is crucial in the fights and puzzles as the game progresses.\n\nSound through the game is beautiful. My last playthrough was on Windows 10 with a Creative Soundblaster Z and a Logitech 5.1 Surround Speaker set. I was suprised to find the eax dll within the game files. (The game only supports Windows Vista or later). Previously I had played on an Asus Xonar DX on the same speakers. With my current setup, positional sound was very clear, the music which Arabian themed is mesmerising ramping up and settling down as the situation demanded. Some people clain to have issue with sound using Realtek onboard sound cards, but as I have always played the game using discrete soundcards.\n\nThe story, graphics and sound all combine to produce an incredible atmosphere in the game which compells me on. I am on my third playthrough still enjoying the atmosphere immensely.\n\nThat said, due to the mechanics the game does lack challenge. (I miss the days when you were actually required to stay alive to complete the game). You will fall, but Elika will always save you. This can make it frustrating in one of the last levels as you are in is constantly retried again and again. The resolution is limited to 1920x41080 maximum and graphic options are accessed through the game launcher. (There is a way to edit the Windows registry to enable you to play at 4k resolutions. and my last playthrough has been entirely at a 4k Resolution). Keyboard and Mouse or Xbox 360/ONE controller can be used to play the game and the keys are rebindable. (I recommend playing with a controller as this is my preferred method for this style of game).","September 3, 2015","true","48.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It’s entertaining for those that want to play a game with little challenge and looking for something relatively mindless but I wouldn’t recommend this game to anyone who wants anything in depth in terms of characters or story.\n\nThe best part of the game is the art-style used. It’s a bit more timeless in comparison to the other Prince of Persia games which all seemed to have aged relatively bad over the years. There isn’t much of a learning curve with this game and the game constantly reminds you over and over again how to react to certain situations.\n\nThere are a ton of things though that make this probably a 5.75/10 though in my book. It’s only slightly better than mediocre and could have been a lot worse. The characters are forgettable and even a bit annoying. The story is clique and I was able to guess the ending almost near the beginning of the game. The ending too left a bad taste in my mouth and is left open for more games but the dlc made was never made available for the pc and the next game in the series is only available on the Nintendo DS.\n\nProbably the worst part of this game though is the camera. Oh my god… I never thought a game could make me experience motion sickness until I played this. There’s this skill that Elika uses that makes the two main characters seemingly fly and when this happens the camera does all sort of nonsense by turning every direction. I felt sick at times watching the screen. And when the protagonist has to jump or scale walls, the camera sometimes moves, causing the controls to go in a different direction than intended.\n\nAs I said, this isn’t the worst game; in fact, it could have been an interesting prologue to a truly unique span of games but Ubisoft isn’t one of those developers concerned with plot. That’s what hurts: this game had so much potential but it only comes off as so-so. Maybe once the whole Assassin Creed phase is over with Ubisoft will revamp this series with better storylines and characters but until then, at least there’s this game to curb some anticipation.\n","December 29, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some places are easy, some are pretty hard, together it makes a balanced experience. I find the whole concept of cleaning the world from corruption very appealing, I wish it could be done outside of the game as well. The visuals are great, the voice acting is superb, dialogs cheer you up with humour, the female companion is pretty, overall I find it an enjoyable experience. I thought it's mostly for a younger audience, it looks so console-ish. But when you play, it's all fine, and fights are fun, especially since you can't exactly "die". Lots of cool movements and tricks you can pull with the enemies. Just as you're getting tired of jumping and performing acrophobic acrobatics, there comes a fight for a change. A few dialogs afterwards ease the tension. A few last boss fights are rather exhausting, as they are full of quick time events, and you must remember which symbol corresponds to which button to press. But when you master it, it can be fun, but maybe too enduring. Unfortunately, the game doesn't quite end, because of a DLC that was never released for PC, only for consoles. But if gaming for you is a recreational activity, I can recommend this one. It won't wear you down as much as it will entertain. It is pretty long, took me 35 hours to finish it. Now I wonder if I should buy PS3 just to play that DLC...","November 27, 2013","true","35.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I gotta say right outta the start that yes, I am a bit dissapointed about the difficulty level.  The game series carries quite a legacy and reputation, the prince series was one of the few games that taught me to have fun with a game even when sometimes is infuriatingly difficult.\n\nMost people say that Dark souls gave them back something they really missed from 2D games, actual hard challenge, to me that game was "Prince of Persia 3D" (the Mattel one) it was so hard to advance and at the same time so adicting because of the combat system and the feeling of achieving something every level you completed.\n\nSo OK this one is easy, insultingly easy for any game actually (and more so for a PoP) since Elika (your partner) ALWAYS saves you, does not matter if you fall of a cliff or are about to have a sword jabbedd on your ♥♥♥ for sucking at combat SHE. ALWAYS. BAILS. YOU. And that is the main issue with this game, I dare say the only one.\n\nThe game looks great, the graphics are (to my liking) very nice and it gives a completely lively atmosphere. The combat system  is very enjoyable, it reminded me a bit of PoP 3D, and though you canot lose I loved the combos and coop with Elika.\n\nTalking of Elika, the BEST parts of this game are both related to her, the simple (but good) storyline and the small interactions and dialogues with Elika, they are lovable.\n\nAbout why I really liked the story (even though is quite straightforward) is the ending of the adventure. I wont spoil the ending, but I really loved it because it breaks a very known cliche in videogames and books in general and it earned my respect for that.\n\nThe interactions with Elika during the story and the scenarios are great, it builds up the character, make you really care for them and gives a lot of interesting tidbits of both the Prince and her. I also loved the small animations on they have during in the gameplay (like when the Princes carries her in the vines and ask her not to press his neck too tight, or when the prince catches Elika after climbing down a wall) those details really make the characters stand out and feel more lively.\n\nIn general I enjoyed the game but I feel I would have loved it if the difficulty level was upped a lot more and if the combat system added longer combos (relying more on reaction time) and more variable enemies (every battle is a duel, there are no mobs and they mostly react the same except for the bosses)","May 24, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After Sands of Time I gave the next two games in the original trilogy a miss because I wasn't interested in the darker, more combat driven direction the series was going in.  I love the visual style and the banter between the Prince and princess in the version. Collecting the light seeds and traversing the world was the best bits for me, the combat was tedious and am glad that there wasn't that much of it.\nI never really like hack&slash sword-based combat in games anyway. Although I said that I prefer Sands of Time over this that is because of the level design and story, not the combat. The combat in Sands of time accounts for about 50% of the game whereas in this I think it's more like 30%.\nI had no problem with not being able to die, it was refreshing actually and kept me in the sweet spot of gaming.\nI have noticed a bug with my game though. In one section of the game the light seeds continue to respawn. It doesn't allow you to cheat however since they don't add to your multiplier, they just make it very difficult to tell whether you actually have all 45 in that area. Luckily I succeeded and gained all 1001 light seeds.\n\nFYI, this game has FULL controller support.\n\nI give this game a solid 8/10\n","January 26","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Love the cell shaded graphics. Its been said that, you have to buy the DLC to get the real ending. My question is: is there even an ending?\n\nI wouldn't know. I have not beaten it yet. Read up on it before you purchase it. Keep your money if you feel this game is uncomplete.","February 22","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definitely recommend to play.\n\n- definitely need to play with controller.\n\n- camera can go a bit wonky sometimes, but no more than other games like this\n\n- story started out boring, but got way more interesting as time went on\n\n- combat was fun, and much easier once I figured out the timing of attacks\n\n- once I got the hang of traveling, it was a LOT of fun figuring how to get from point A to point B.\n\n- pretty environments, and interesting level design\n\n- good voice acting, and liked the chemistry of actors\n\n- jumped to my death a billion times due to sometimes twitchy controls  (but nothing that I’d consider too unfair.  and without minor death penalty, simply a matter of re-trying.)\n\n","January 2","true","18.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And from that I like this game, even today. But I don't know if I could really recommend this for everyone. To collect 1001 light orbs, backtracking and repetive acrobatic elements are sometimes painful and anooying to sit through. You don't have to collect all 1001, but the reward is two alternative costumes for the Prince and Princess, that what I heard somewhere are prototype or alpha versions.\n\nI enjoyed the atmosphere with the middle-eastern architecture, music, character design and combat system. The story is not bad, nothing much else to add than it's simple and easy to follow.\n\nI'd recommend this game to you if you love adventure games.\n","April 25","true","12.1"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Period!\n\nThe game itself seems funny, and wonderfully designed. Easy controls, however; has an obnoxious tutorial that you'd except EA, except this one follows you throughout the gameplay for some reason.","May 4","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
