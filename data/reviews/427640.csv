You have just been told you have super powers. Not just one super power, but your power is the ability to absorb other super powers from other super heroes. Luckily you happen to go to school with plenty of other superheroes allowing you to coincidentally make use of this otherwise pretty poor superpower.  The platforming side of the game is tedious at best, with way too many jumping puzzles for my liking as well as some plain and simple luck based mechanics thrown in too such as having to jump to avoid oncoming cars (which seem to come out of nowhere) whilst also dealing with enemies at the same time. The combat side of the game is again, at best, tedious. You had better be prepared to get arthritis in your fingers because you will be pounding the shoot button harder than anything.\n\nThe game’s lack of any tutorial system makes learning controls something that has to be done on the fly. I tried to access the control menu but this bugs the game out and you just get the controls as a see through overlay on your screen with no way to exit out of it.   Once you manage to figure out what all the buttons do on your controller, you will also notice a slight bit of input lag on whatever you press, this is especially annoying given the game has portions of platforming in, and timing your attacks with jumps is also a key element of the game.\n\nThe way in which you “unlock” new powers is by saving your friends from the enemies which have captured them. I thought this was a cool little way of allowing the player to choose which students to save first depending on which ability they would like access to, to start with.  Enemies and bosses are very generic and offer no real challenge, a couple of shots with your weapon will often destroy them, whereas the bosses just act as a bigger bullet sponge whilst you dodge out of the way of projectiles being thrown/shot at you. Nothing really unique stands out from the combat side of the game sadly.\n\nVisually, the game is very basic. It’s a side scrolling game, so there can only be so much graphical fidelity on show, but this just looks like a PS2 game at best. Janky animations from anything that moves, to bland un interesting textures seen throughout the game.  Lack of any voice acting is again very apparent as there is plenty of dialogue between characters whether it is in the game or via cut scenes after levels.\n\nI wouldn’t think Ables is a hard game if it didn’t suffer from controller issues, but given there is input lag, this just adds to the difficulty unnecessarily which sadly results in plenty of silly deaths and unwarranted damage taking when you have quite clearly pressed the button to jump, but the game doesn’t play out your action for a millisecond too late.\nI have been playing for just under an hour so far, and I have already managed to rescue over a third of the students, I can’t see this game lasting any more than another hour at most going off the current trend of pace. At the moment there isn’t any replay ability. What would make Ables a much better experience is to add in a co-op mode. At the start of the game, there is a choice between two characters, so it would just make sense to be able to play this with a friend on the couch. I believe that this addition would be a huge bonus to the game because anything is instantly better when playing with friends.\n\nApart from the controller issues, the only other gripe I have technically with Ables, is the lack of any resolution higher than 1080p. With 4K becoming more and more popular, this should be added into any recent released PC game. It’s not a major issue right now given that it isn’t standard, but it just shows correct foresight from the developer to include it.  I played the game with an Xbox controller, but I wouldn’t recommend you even consider trying the game with a keyboard given the latency issues.\n\nAt this moment in time, I am not able to recommend Ables: Freepoint High, quite simply because it isn’t a finished product. If the developers are able to tighten up the controller problems, add in a little more in depth combat system and maybe even a co-op mode, then I would love to revisit this game.  Unfortunately for now though, I am not going to recommend Ables.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

All my developer sponsored reviews are positive because I review games that I like!\n\n\nIntro\nThe Ables: Freepoint High is a side-scroller beat’em up platformer that is defined by its’ retro 90’s-esque 3-D graphics, pulsing soundtrack, and wide variety of powers on display in its’ gameplay.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are reminiscent of 2.5D platformer. It moves in 2-D like many platformers do (in which you move to the left and right). However, the graphics themselves are of a 3-D nature, your character and the environment are 3-D.\n\nSound\nOh man! This is where the game really shines. When you hear the music pumping through when you hit the title screen, it really provides such an engrossing and energetic atmosphere that will just snatch you up and put in the rhetorical cockpit of the game.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is pretty straightforward, in the introductory level, all the different powers that will be at your disposal are on display for you to use in the level. This first level is complete with platform jumping, enemy bashing, and even a boss encounter that exudes a thrilling experience. After this level is completed, you go on to choose which levels you go on to next. You choose the next level by choosing which of your gifted peers you want to save next.\n\nPros & Cons\nPros:\n•	Cool 2.5D Graphics that are different than many platformers out there on Steam.\n•	A great soundtrack that you actually want to listen to while you are playing\n•	A wide variety of powers that lets people choose the way they want to play the game.\n\nCons:\n•	After beating the initial level, you only have access to 3 of the 7 levels, because the other 4 are still in development.\n•	Can be a tad glitchy at times, it will not affect your gaming experience at all, but nonetheless, it is noticeable.\n•	Controls may need to be reminded, the default keyboard mapping will not work for everybody.\n\nOverall Thoughts\nThis is a solid early-access game that is exactly as advertised and has much potential for the future. I would wait on purchasing though for right now until all of the game’s levels have been implemented so you get a complete game. These developers have been motivated and dependable though, so I doubt that won’t take much longer to happen.\n\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group  here !","December 17, 2015","true","1.5"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","16","23","4","0"

So, that's not really a good start, since failure doesn't really do much.\n\nHonestly, there isn't really much of a story or even humor or anything I could tell. You just did the tutorial and had the attack with the kidnappings, then you're off. The dialogue from there is just, you need to flip a switch and there is the kidnapped person. You get a tiny bit at the end, but eh.\n\nYou can't turn an shoot and that gets kind of awkward, but it works fine for the most part. There really isn't any reason to not shoot since you can hit targets off screen, but you can blow past important information that springs up.  I'll put it here since I mentioned it. If you are being talked to, you can still be attacked, so fun times.\n\nPowers are pretty bland. Most of the damage moves don't really need to be there since they come out pretty slow or you would better be suited to saving that energy for something else, like flying. The rest do what they need to, which one at the end kinda defeats the point of a large amount they expected you to use at the time.\n\nThis game has a bunch of bugs, whether its getting stuck going up stairs to the game spawning you in the floor after dying, at least for me at the final area.\n\nThe camera is a huge pain in the ♥♥♥ in the game, which if you aren't spamming your weapon, usually results in cheapshots or possible instant death when they start putting lasers just beyond the reach of the camera.\n\nThe stages don't really feel all that well put together, it feels so blah going through the areas, especially with the limited amount of reused enemies and no real good reason to explore, as far as I could tell. You just keep walking by or doing what you have to and the stage just keeps going and going.\n\nBosses tend to be a bit dumb. Some have gimmicky ways to kill you off in one hit, which, since there isn't much of a punishment, doesn't matter too much. Usually though, you can just run behind the target and smash the fire button till your finger flies off, with no real challenge. I liked the concept of the final boss, but it falls really flat once you realize one of the abilities trumps the other ones the game wants you to use.\n\nOh, almost forgot to mention, the hitboxes, ya. Just a tad bit off, alot.  Usually coming from the bigger enemies.\n\nOverall, it was a generally dull experience. I found some items that might do something interesting, but really don't want to fully explore the levels again to just get a slight more meh.\n\nWouldn't recommend it.","May 6","false","2.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/427640/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOld School Memories:  This is a side-scrolling beat ’em up game. These were the absolute bees knees when I was a younger gamer. The fond memories of the genre came flooding back to me from the very moment I began playing here. That, of course, means that games such as Double Dragon, Golden Axe, Final Fight, Altered Beast and Renegade were on the top of my mind. The answer I would immediately ask is how does The Ables: Freepoint High stack up against the classics? Surprisingly for an early access title not too badly. Qiwi Games acknowledges the roots of the title’s genre by implementing 90’s-esque graphics with a soundtrack to match. However, they’ve also recognized today’s standards and are working hard to implement modern expectations. It’s a balancing act but one that they’re well on the way to meeting.\n\nAlmost perfect gameplay: This will be one of those reviews that tracks back to the first point throughout. However, that’s because everything meets such a high level of consistency throughout the game that it’s impossible not to. The game play is tight with one caveat. I’d really like to see the double jump feature improved immensely. It’s going to be pivotal to defeating a number of the challenges throughout the game yet it’s not quite as tidy as it should be.\n\nBased on a book: The game is based on the best selling book, The Ables, by Jeremy Scott. Admittedly I have never read the book but the game already has encouraged me to pick it up. I would encourage fans of the book to pick up the game. Jeremy Scott is also the co-creator and narrator of CinemaSins, one of the more popular channels on YouTube.\nAwesome soundtrack: I would be remiss if I didn’t make a specific point about the soundtrack. The score has been created by Ronald Jenkees. Jenkees started out as one of the most talented musicians on YouTube but his rise to fame can be tracked directly to Bill Simmons. Simmons, the famous sports commentator hired Jenkees to create the theme music to his popular podcast. That particular theme is titled ‘Derty.’\n\nA lot of work to be done: Currently only four of the seven levels are complete. However, what is available is super fun to play. I’m a big fan of the tutorial level which demonstrates what all of the super powers will enable you to do once the game is feature and content complete. That’s not to say that the price is high for the value that you get at the moment just that there is a lot more content to come.\n\nThe Ables: Freepoint High has the potential to be the very best side scrolling beat ’em up in recent years. It may even be on par or ahead of the classics but at this stage as a gamer it’ll be a very tough ask for it to be considered better because of just how much sentimental value those games hold. But for someone who treasured those games I couldn’t ask for much more than what Qiwi Games is offering me. They will raise the price prior to release but the $9.99 is a fair price for what the title already offers.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 17","true","0.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

I really enjoyed the book, so when I first learned about this game, I knew I was going to buy it. These are my unbiased thoughts of the game so far.\n\nPros:\n- Good looking graphics, somewhat reminiscent of Mega Man games.\n- Beautiful background music.\n- The gameplay works well, starting off fairly easy, then sending you into a real challenge quickly.\n- The boss fights are a nice challenge, taking me a few tries to beat them.\n- A wide variety of powers at your character's disposal.\n\nCons:\n- Lack of customization for characters.\n- Only half of the levels are currently available.\n- You can't control where the fireballs go. There are times where you want to hit a certain enemy, but they will go after a different one.\n- The hand blasters can only fire directly in front of you. I wish you could control the direction in which you fire like you do with the laser eyes.\n- I never like it when enemies in a game follow a pattern, preferring that they react to the player. Some of them do that, but a good chunk of them don't.\n- During the boss fight in the Beach Cave, there is a point where it's impossible to avoid taking damage, that being after he summons the mini Supernovas then uses his powers to fly to the other platform at the top of the screen.\n- During the Transportation Center level, the difficulty seems to suddenly spike too high out of nowhere.\n- Also during this level, the game will start lagging when a lot of enemies spawn at once.\n- As you're entering the boss fight of this level, there is a glitch where sometimes the screen will leave without you, automatically killing you.\n\nSins:\n- What's the point in having super strength as an optional power if punching becomes obsolete once you obtain the hand  blasters? There should be a way to switch between blasting and punching.\n- During the first level, why is it that none of the other students are doing anything? Why do they just stand there until they see me, then give me their powers so I can do all the work?\n- Where were the teachers during all of this?\n- During the Downtown level, why is the player running in the middle of the street instead of on the sidewalk? They could avoid the cars a whole lot easier this way instead of jumping over them.\n- Game does not contain a lap dance.\n\nOverall thoughts:\nThis game has a lot of potential. At only $9.99 (though I bought it during the holiday sale) it is a definite purchase. It does have quite a few problems that need to be fixed, but I'm sure that once they are, this game will be all the more enjoyable.","December 29, 2015","true","4.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","5","10","4","0"

The game has a great soundtrack and has a beautiful artstyle going for it. Not all of the levels have been finished yet, but so far I'm really enjoying what they gave us\n\nStory\n\nIn this world based on the best-selling YA novel The Ables, by Jeremy Scott, you play as a powerful super hero known as an "Absorber'' You can collect and master many different super powers to save your friends from the mysterious "Believers" who have attacked your town!" You get to choose between 2 characters, Alex and Emily. You have to save your town with a wide variety of powers you get along the way.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe gameplay consists of platforming, boss battles and beating up enemies with the powers you collect and absorb. As I already said. The game is a sidescroller that has old school Metroid-like gameplay. For example, the first level consists of platforming action where you shoot your enemies with fireballs. The boss battle that follows is surprisingly challenging!\nAfter you finish the first level, you get to choose between four levels, with each having a different student to rescue. Where the gameplay really shines, though, is the fact that you have so many powers at your disposal to annihilate your enemies with.\n\nGraphics & Sound\n\nThe game has a beautiful artstyle, a great soundtrack and some neat 3D levels. Which means you move left and right, up and down like most sidescrollers do. Its nothing special for these days standard but the graphics are fine for a sidescroller like this. The sound effects are well made.\n\nPROS\nGreat soundtrack\nVariety in powers, I would not be surprised if more are coming!\nThrilling boss battles\nVarious enemy types\nOld school platforming\nCONS\nRight now, you can only play three more missions after the first one. The other four are still in development\nSome bugs and glitches\nSome of the powers are a bit annoying to control\nVerdict\n\nThis game had exactly what I wanted! It's challenging, fun, and has solid gameplay! Since it's still in early access there are some bugs that need fixing, but they do not impact the gameplay much. If you want the full game, you should wait until they finish the other levels. However, I recommend it for sidescrolling and Jeremy Scott fans. It is a fast-paced game with great potential. I had fun playing this game, and that is what games are for, right? $9.99 is a fair price for what it has to offer.\nFinal verdict:  8/10  The soundtrack: 10/10 \(^^)/\n\nWant more recommendations?

I've never read the book. However, I do plan on doing so soon. Now, back to the game. At a first glance, the game looks like a normal game. But, it is in early access. So that means that there is bound to be much more improvement in the future. I have not played a whole lot of the game, but from my experience, the game is relatively good as is. That leads me to my ups and downs.\n\nUps:\n* Features a character selection, you can choose either Emily or Alex\n* Has a unique power up system, with lots of variation\n* Includes character dialogue, offering hints, which you can't find in some games, making it very difficult to achieve victory in a level, per se.\n* Offers a tutorial level, explaining powerups, enemies, movements, Etc.\n* Has a weekly update to improve bugs, glitches and other pesky 'things'\n\nAnd now, I will talk about some of the downs..\n\nDowns:\n* Limited settings\n* Can be quite glitchy at times\n* Has no save/ checkpoint feature\n* Although you can choose a character, you cannot customize them, like purchase hats, or shirts, Etc.\n\nOther than that though, It is safe to say that this game has loads of potential (In my opinion, of course). Bugs can be fixed, features can be added, and besides, it is early access. It is evident that a lot of thought and work had/ will go into this game. And even though I am cheating, and playing before reading *ding*, the game is quite enjoyable. And I bet more understandable once I read the book. Either way. Your dev. crew should give themselves a pat on the back, because they have earned it, and so have you, Jeremy (If you even read this)! I look forward to playing more of this amazing game!!\n\n\n*Completely unrelated not to Jeremy*\nIf you do in fact read this, I will feel like a Starwars prequel getting a mere 500 sins. I think that you are doing fantastic at CinemaSins, and I also enjoy watching your videos on CinemaSins Jeremy and also MusicVideoSins. Anyway, you are doing a great job.

Only problem with the game is the lack of options in terms of powers only doing one thing.

This game is essentially a sequel to that book, but you don't really need to read the book to understand what's going on in the game.  They do a pretty good job of exposition while still throwing you right into the action.  It's not a particularly inventive platformer, but there is a compelling story and the game itself is fun to play.  It also works well with an xbox controller.","February 15","true","0.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"
