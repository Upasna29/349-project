"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198028630380/recommended/398020/","76561198028630380","DeviousDave","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198028630380/","326 products in account","So this game....\n\nWell before I get into anything about it let me warn you potential buyer that this game is HARD (with a capital H,A,R and D for emphasise) and that there are bugs (both the type you kill with a shotgun and the type you kill with coding changes)\n\nPermadeath is a thing in this game, lose all your Marines and it's back to the menu you go, lose the APC, your pretty much ****d and back to the menu you go, get backed into a corner - menu time, rock falls everyone dies, yep you guessed it, back to the menu you go.\n\nAs another review said, this game is almost Dwarf Fortress levels of hard and is about as forgiving as a Elephant (the bain of Dwarfs) who you've just whipped in the love spuds with a wet towel.  Let alone the fact that the tutorial is actually a manual and the first mission throws you in the deep end, while your high on drugs, without a floatation device and screams "Swim boy, swim" at you while your being pelted with orbital based death (rocks fall and YOU die)\n\nBut then it all starts to make sense and little by little you progress through the map:\n\nYou make it the base without being squashed (pro tip, those items on the ground at the start CAN be picked up and used)\nYou knock out some turrets and blow a hole in the wall (F8 is your friend here)\nYou figure out most of the controls and manage to complete your objective (one way or another, it's amazing what a liberal application of C4 can solve)\nYou make it to mission 2\nYou crash the APC\nYou get owned by everything in sight\nYou try again\nAnd again\nAnd again\nYou finally have everything down that you need to know and become a lean mean killing machine.\nYou feel like a total badass.\nYou get cocky\nSomething new comes along and kicks your ♥♥♥ sending you back to the menu crying like a b***h\n\nSo yeah, be prepared to stare at the menu screen a lot while playing this, your going to become quite good friends :)\n\nRight then onto the rest of the game, the graphics are meh. Which for the most part is not an issue although the Marines could do with a serious touchup to make them actually look like space marines and not brown haired clones.\n\nThe sound is ok, motion tracker is nice and sounds similar to the one from Aliens while the guns are your generic [Insert gun firing sound here] affair.\n\nUI. Very unfriendly and until you tame it will attempt to bite your hands at every chance.\n\nGameplay... I'm not gonna sugarcoat this, it has a LOT of backtracking, you go to colony building 'X', fight through alien hoard,  pick up survivors, run like frak back to the APC, depending on how many survivors there were (APC has limited room) go to another building and repeat or go back to the space port to drop them off for evac. This game has as much backtracking as Metroid.\n\nAI. Does the job, nothing more, nothing less.\n\nAtmosphere. Captures the feel of Aliens perfectly. Hell, the only way it could be more Aliens is if a modder came along and redid all the Marines to look like Colonial Marines and the APC and Dropship to look like the ones from the movies (hint, hint modders)\nMotion tracker sounds great (even though it picks up your marines and APC which gets anoying)\nYou can weld doors shut (or cut them open/blow them off their hinges)\nC4 is fun and has a nice countdown effect.\nWeather effects and lighting help raise the tension and make it feel like LV426 from Aliens.\nThe monsters (Aliens) are fast and can come out of nowhere very quickly if your not careful.\n\nOverall I recommend this game for its pricetag. It's not the best game ever, it's not the worst. It is a better Aliens game than a certain other game made by a much larger professional gaming studio i know of *cough* Box Gear *cough*\nand while as I (and others) have said, this game is HARD and very unforgiving (so be prepared for frustration) it does have its moments where the Awesome dial gets turned up to 11. So if your looking for the best Aliens Colonial Marine simulator in well.... forever, then this might just be for you.\n\nP.S This game has been named wrong, it should have been called Marine Commander simulator 2015, seriously, it's that hard.\n\np.p.s, Ignore the hours played... Steam dun goofed and hasn't regestered them for some reason.... might be because I was offline at the time and the game crashed :(\n\np.p.p.s Seriously, any good modders out there who want a great Aliens game, were waiting for you. I'd do it myself but I shudder to think of the horror I might release upon an unsuspecting public.\n\nEDIT: Turns out it's even easier to mod than I thought, 10 minutes of google fu will net you a modified dropship and APC that you can edit into the game with just paint.net to bring home the Aliens feel (warning can cause some graphic issues)","December 16, 2015","true","2.4"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","85","34","40","16","0"

The 2nd mission is a ton of fun just getting past the first is a chore though and the tutorial is a desert of information.  Also, there are stability issues, I haven't had many but they are annoying.  There are a lot of bugs that need to be worked out (particularly getting scientists to stay in the police station, game crashes).  The command UI is ARMA2 complicated but once you've worked with it you can get things done fairly fast.  The screen effects are pretty annoying (wish they had an option to turn them off);  and for the meteorites, there is a method to avoiding them consistently.  In fact I almost never get unless I forget that they aren't just for ambiance.\n\nThat being said, the premise is really cool;  it's like AVP2 but what if the main compound wasn't overrun before you got there.  There are also a lot of cool little mechanics like your squad have limited ammo, but can resupply at the APC (but if the APC stock runs dry your done).  Most of the games worth comes from the 50,000 ways you can approach the 2nd mission and survival.\n\nOverall, the game needs more polish and more content wouldn't hurt;  it is however a ton of fun.","February 16","true","21.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

The amount of backtracking you have to do is insane and the screen effects to give the game more atmosphere just end up being annoying.

This game is not what I would call User friendly in the sence of plop figure out the ♥♥♥♥ yourself.  I would class this game rouge like and tedious, as this game will rip you a new hole to go with the bleeding one it left. I would like to say this game does provide a unique experiance and expect to die a good deal and there are some outlying bugs with the game currently that need to be patched.\n\nUpdate*\nSo far after playing a little bit of the second mission which could take some serious planning. I've noticed that the ai are competent in what you would expect, your marines will back away from enemies charging and do a particularly good job of murdering them and some times they like to dance around each other if you place too many marines in one area\n\nP.S I had the paitence to sit down and play this game due to playing dwarf fortress.\nLosing is fun!","December 15, 2015","true","13.2"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","12","19","2","0"

I would pick it but to even it out....I'll put a yes to it.\n\nSo I got the game,here's my opinion.\n\nFirst opinions\nThis game reminds me of running with rifles and colonial marines,a lot and I do like the concept of a colonial marines,squad based top down shooter with a non-cannon story to it. From looking at it I find it to be okay with some features.\n\nBut from looking at the review scores and the reviews I kind of hesitated in buying it and I asked the community  if it would be a good idea or not,saddly I only got one response but it was an honest response that this game seemed more of an early access deal than a full blown game. It has its quirks of perma death that I can live with but it gets annoying to constantly die and get set back to the start.\n\nI did eventually buy the game on sale (€5.99) and I did enjoy it a good bit.\n\nGameplay\nWhen I played this I had no idea what I was doing and luckily there was a tutorial.\nThe tutorial was not good or bad but it did gave the information but for some people,they don't like reading and would rather skip to the action.\n\nAll weapons and vehicles metioned below are in mission two.\n\nGun-play is what you'd expect from a top down shooter with good weapons which includes a mini-gun,flamethrower and grenade launcher.\n\nThrow-able objects are there such as the frag grenades and the ones used in the grenade launcher as well as land mines,proximity and pressure.\n\nYou do have air support,it's the dropship.\nArmed with an HE auto cannon and missile launcher,it does save your ♥♥♥ a lot if you use it correctly.\n\nSquad mechanics are simple but not too simple as you can direct your squad individually or as a whole to move to one place or to follow you.\n\nYou also have an APC.\nIt's armed with an auto-turret with 10000 rounds I think and a good bit of armour till it explodes.\nIt does show damage depending on its durability which is quite nice too see but might have contributed to the FPS drops here and there.\n\nThe enemies are aliens with princesses instead of queens and regular drones and some have blood on their claws.\n\nThe AI is,meh to say the best and the least. Not that good but it's passable.\n\nThe missionsThe missions are tought enough with perma-death as a thing. It's too much trial and error but you get the hang of it soon after but it will take time.\n\nFinal say\nSo would I recommend it?\nAt its current state. It's okay but not that okay. It lacks content and is tedious to get past the first mission.","March 10","true","10.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Yes the first mission is tough and annoying but once you finally get past it then starts the "real" game. On the 2nd mission what i consider the main game you have a wide open space with a few simple taskes, all non scripted. It's basically Aliens 2 where you have to rescue colonists from a planet with aliens being a constant threat. And to be honest for $7.99 I would take this game way over Aliens Colonial Marines. Its not perfect  but it really is worth a shot.","December 21, 2015","true","3.4"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","9","15","2","0"

This title is not Early access but it feels like a alpha build.\n\nI think it wasn't really a smart idea to release it in the current state. It crashes too much, and there are bugs ...\n\nI hope that in next games, the developers pay more attention to detail and quality.\n\nWould love to have a reason to buy it again.
