If anything of this appeals to you, this might too.\n\nIn any case, this game's remarkable. It's challenging, exciting and unforgiving. But let me tell you, it's just as satisfying once you get a feel for it.\n\nYou start out in a minimalistic world, sitting in the infamous Toyota Trueno AE86. Your destiny? Drift. A brief tutorial follows, which will probably result in you crashing into walls a lot, but that's fine, as nothing else really is needed to understand how this game works! The game then releases you into a free-roaming environment with a few missions you have to do to unlock more stages. You can then also select stages, cars and tracks once in Free-roam mode, a bit like in NFS or other racing titles.\n\nAs you get more familiar with the controls, the stages get more exciting and challenging/longer. They also come in several formats: Lap-based drift-tracks, Driftkhana, which is a highscore time-attack inside an arena, or mountain sprint tracks. The goal is always the same, drift gracefully, score points, interact with objects such as poles to drift past or boxes to shatter, add that up to the final score and remain away from hitting walls or losing your combo. Sounds easier than it is, trust me, the Japanese themed tracks and names will kick into your curb at first.\n\nThat said, car handling is the key, each car has their own way of handling, so finding what suits you most will be the way to go. Ontop of that, drifting's the deal, so going fast won't always be the key to success either. Manual or automatic shifting? How high should be the turning sensitivity? Well, all these factors will help you optimize your driving style, making it possible to reach up to be the drift king.\n\nI personally had, and will have a blast with this title in the future. It's been a while since I found an appealing drifting/racing experience and I can safely say this game has done it right. Now go... Go... and be the next Drift-King.","August 2, 2015","true","29.8"," 87 of 89 people (98%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","98","87","89","9","11"

In fact, let me swoon over it, let me drool all over my keyboard. This game feels absolutely perfect. Surely it is not a perfect game as there should/could be still some content added like maybe a simple map designing tool (with workshop support?). This game actually looks very simple, the surface is white and each of your tyres leaves skidmarks to see how smoothly each of your four wheels cleared a corner. Important things are coloured red.\nI am not cutting to the chase, but the feeling of "Absolute Drift" is just great. this game lets you peacefully control a car sliding around a menu-like open map with objectives to do and areas to unlock. There are special tracks for each gamemode which can be entered. The atmosphere is well-rounded with an electronic soundtrack, subtle tyre squealing and rich car sounds.\n\nI like to drive the car of my family in real life and I got experience with racing games like "Live For Speed", "SHIFT 2 Unleashed" or "BeamNG.drive". So before I tried this game I already had some drifting experience (using a steering wheel), which most likely helped me get into this game quickly.\nIf you are not sure, whether you like the game mechanics, you can check for a demo on indieDB, though it is by far not as developed as the final game.\n\nSo should you buy this game and support the developers? Definitely, yes!\nWell, given that you are into going sideways, but if you are looking at this, you probably are.","July 30, 2015","true","24.3"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","36","40","3","0"

Of course the most important part of a vehicle game of any sort are the controls. I will admit that the controls in Absolute Drift are quite tight while the driving itself does feel a bit too slippery, but as you might guess it’s not a big deal in a game where your only goal is to slide stylishly. Absolute Drift also boasts a unique Japanified minimalist aesthetic, paying homage to one of the origins of the drifting motorsport. It isn’t all roses but let’s not hesitate to pop the hood and see what we got, this is Absolute Drift.\n\nFree Roam mode serves as the Story Mode, and will serve to introduce you to the controls as well as different challenges and events. After spinning out a few times and learning the art of counter-steering you will begin to grasp what the game is really all about and because there is very little hand-holding, conquering a world challenge or topping the global highscore for any track feels like a great accomplishment. Absolute Drift has a total of 23 tracks to enjoy; 10 circuit Drift tracks, 9 open-world Driftkhana courses, and 4 one-way Mountain Drift tracks, so you can find the event that suits you best.\n\nWhile the world challenges and events have as much variety as can be expected, I find that it still isn’t quite enough. Drift around this, drift between that, it isn’t until the last stage that things start getting really interesting. All I’m saying is I wanted to jump on a few more roofs. Car customization is limited to 6 body-types, which all have a slightly different feel. You can also pick a color and a decal, but nothing beyond that. I would really like a chance to fine-tune my engine and shocks. Stripped-down customization and lack of real-time damage are gigantic missed opportunities.\n\nI enjoyed my time with Absolute Drift, with its low-key dance music soundtrack, inoffensive looks, and high degree of mastery. Lack of customization and content hurts replayability, but the difficulty curve and global scoreboards means it still has quite a bit to offer. The story mode can be completed in around 2 hours, and if that’s all you’re buying this game for then $12 might be a bit overpriced. It is a bit of a one-trick pony, but it does that trick extremely well. If you’re in the mood for a score-attack drifting game, give Absolute Drift a try. Though it might be worth waiting for a sale. Big thanks to Funselektor Labs for the review copy! We at IGB hope to see more quite soon.\n\nGameplay:\n\nControls- 8/10\nFun Factor- 4/10\nDifficulty- 3/10\nReplayability- 8/10\nInnovation- 7/10\n\nAesthetic:\n\nGraphics- 7/10\nMusic- 9/10\nSound FX- 6/10\nStory/Lore- 1/10\nLevel Design- 6/10\n\nFinal Score: 59/100 for replayability, controls, and music.\nSummary: Minimalist drifting simulator with a large degree of difficulty, and a rocking soundtrack.\nVerdict: A bit of a one-trick pony, but it does that trick exceedingly well.

You play from a 3D, third person “top-down” perspective, as you traverse 7 worlds completing various drifting tasks. The goal? Become a master drifter, sliding over water and doing donuts around Ferris Wheels. Here are a few things worth noting.\n\nArt Style\nThe elegant contrast of white landscapes against bright red obstacles is the key idea behind the art style of AD. The graphics look gorgeous with their minimalistic textures and subtle physics. As you drive through stacks of blocks, you’ll be blown away at how the particles just seem to fall away without hesitation. The soundtrack is perfectly suited for the game, and huge props to the artists for their great work in that department.\n\nDifficulty\nThe game seems simple at first – get your car sideways, countersteer, and you’re set. It’s not quite that easy. In free roam you will learn how to stay in drifts and exit the drift whenever you need to. Meanwhile, you can use various events to hone your skills on-track. There’s no difficulty toggle here – in events you are ranked against other players in global and friend-based rankings.\n\nLength, Story, Etc.\nOne of the only gripes I had with this game was the length of the free roam world. There are seven “worlds” you go through before having to resort to replaying tracks over and over just to beat your own times. I would love to see a co-op or even online 1-on-1 game mode in this, and it would definitely give it a bit more reason to play beyond free-roam.\n\nPerformance\nAD runs phenomenally on my rig, as I expected. However, as with all my reviews, I tested the game on Intel Integrated Graphics to see how well it would do for casual gamers. It ran at a solid 35 or so fps, definitely within a playable range. You could likely push it to 50 by playing 1280x720 windowed.\n\nDo I like this game? Absolutely. (Pardon the pun) I would recommend it to anyone looking for a game that they can complete with 100% achievements in less than 5 hours.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nCurator text: Absolute Drift is a masterpiece with its elegant graphics and fantastic physics.

So I thought, "why not?". Here's what I think of this game after a few hours of play:\n\nGraphics: I've always been a huge fan of minimalist/subtle designs, and Absolute Drift pretty much nails that. Everything has a low polygon count. The track is white, the important things are red and the death zone (water) is blue. This very small color palette is great because you can very quickly understand any situation you are in, but it also carries a message that, I think, translates the game well: "No BS, just drifting".\nThe black skidmarks felt kind of strange at first because they are here even when not drifting, but then I understood they were here to serve as a visualization of your driving, because they contrast the pure white track. By simply looking at the skidmarks, you can judge how well your took that last corner. More simply, it just looks nice.\nOn a more technical aspect, at the time I am writing this, the game is very poor. The graphical options are very limited: no custom resolutions, no V-Sync and the graphical quality is limited to a few presets, which means you can't set the anti-aliasing, texture filtering, etc. on your own. Then again, the game launched very recently, so I have faith the developer will add those options later.\n\nAudio: The cars sound good, you can really feel how powerful they are when accelerating and the hissing sound of the tires when drifting is satisfying. The soundtrack blends in very well with the game. It's all electro music (like Drum & Bass), but all of the tracks are very calm. It was a good choice to make the soundtrack relaxing because the player will spend a lot of time failing and retrying, but the tranqulity of those tunes help remain calm.\n\nGameplay: Here comes the most important part, and fortunately, it's the best. The control scheme is pretty much what you'd expect in any driving game: Left-Right-Accelerate-Brake-Handrake-Gear up-Gear down. Learning how the game works takes two minutes at worst, but knowing how to handle the cars themselves is a harder task. You cannot make a normal turn in this game, you will always slide. On top of that, the cars feel very heavy: even when you think you're going pretty slow, drifting will barely make you deccelerate and you will very often end up in a wall because of that at the beginning. When you get the hang of this, however, driving becomes a very smooth experience. You can easily chain multiple drifts and properly gauge acceleration/decceleration.\nThe developper made the very interesting decision of only giving the player an isometric point of view instead of the good old 1st/3rd person cameras you can find in other racing games. It's quite useful because it allows the player to see further ahead than they normally could, and plan their drifts in consequence.\n\nContent: The game is split in two modes: Free-roam, where you drive in open spaces completing missions (which usually are "drift near this", "donut around that", etc.) to open new worlds where you complete more missions, and Events where you can choose to play on either Tracks (with 3 laps), Driftkhanas (small, open spaces where you must score as many points as possible in 2 minutes) and Mountain Drifts (tracks where you drift downhill to the end). There is, at the time of writing, 5 worlds and 24 tracks. The 5 worlds can be completed in about an hour or two and each world also unlocks various Events and one car.\nSomething unfortunate is that all cars are, unless I have not played enough to realize the difference, model+sound swaps. It would have been nice to give all cars a different handling, but perhaps the dev will add this in the future.\nThe good thing about Events is their replayability and the presence of a Leaderboards system. If you want to climb that ladder you will have to master every corner of every track, which is not an issue given how good the cars feel. The large amount of hours sinkable justifies, I believe, the price tag.\nOne thing I would really love to see is the addition of a map maker (perhaps with Workshop integration) in order to enhance the lifespan of this game.\n\nIn conclusion, I would definitely recommend this little gem if you are the kind of person who likes spending a large amount of time on a single game in order to master it.","July 31, 2015","true","7.0"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

Casual and relaxing but also competetive if you're in that mood. The minimalistic graphics and relaxing music creates a very likeable atmosphere (Mirror's Edge comes to mind). The controls are fluid and the physics surprisingly good, which makes the game challenging but also rewarding when you nail a run. There are some annoying bugs, but nothing major. The sound goes wonky sometimes but a restart of the event fixes it and for some reason the car is in reverse at the start of a race occasionally.\n\n"Story mode" is very brief and contains tutorials for the different race modes and simple missions. Missions are repetitive (spin here, do donuts around that, drift through here) and you'll spend a lot of time driving around trying to find the last ones to unlock the next area. I wouldn't recommend this game for the price if you're just going to play through the free roam mode as the content just isn't there. But if you enjoy perfecting your skills there's a lot of replay value and leaderboards to climb. There are three modes: track, mountain pass and gymkhana and quite a few locations for each.\n\nUnfortunatley there seems like some cheating or exploiting exists as some high scores on certain tracks are outright impossible to achieve (I've seen scores ten times higher than second place) but unless you're able to score in the top 3 or so this won't affect you much.\n\nStill, overall a very enjoyable and well executed game. I hope to see more from the developer.","August 6, 2015","true","29.3"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

If you're like me, poor and without a 180SX of you're own, fire up Absolute Drift and get sideways to an absolutely stellar soundtrack! Absolute has a really simplistic "indie" art style with a very Mirrors Edge color scheme, that just works and looks beautiful! For me this game filled a hole for a drifting game after Rockstar ruined GTA5's driving mechanics and didn't allow for drifting of any kind.\n\nPros:\n- Best soundtrack in an indie game since Minecraft\n- Best driving mechanics in any PC game EVER\n- Realistic and awesome vehicle sounds and crash sounds\n- Beautiful art style and color scheme\n- Global leaderboards make for endless replayability!\n- Good variety of vehicles, from a classic 180SX (missile) to the powerful WRX Wagon (hooniwagon)\n- 5 worlds full of fun "missions" as well as a helpful tutorial\n\nCons:\n- Only 5 worlds, even though they are all quite large, I would like to see more added. I would pay $10 for a DLC pack with 5 more worlds.\n- Scoring mechanics are kinda iffy, often destroying your built-up multiplyer even when you are constantly drifting or just because you barely tap a wall.\n\n9.5/10, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

Smooth af\n\nDriving is similar to the early top down GTA games, in that the camera doesn't sit behind the car so steering becomes inverted at times. The cars themselves, handle as if fine tuned to float like sand bags on an ice rink.\n\nIt's a little like the 'Skate' games in that you'll be finding areas of the free roam map and then sessioning that area, only instead of a curb or a rail it's a docking crane and a lamp post.\n\nThe "5 Worlds" are pretty big, each with a couple dozen drifting challanges (tricks highlighted in red) that need to be completed for the bridge to the next zone to drop. Once all zones are connected they form a rather epic playground, diverse and beautifuly crafted. There is no loading between zones so free roam is exactly that.\n\nThe "Events"  are Driftkhana, Drifting, & Mountain Drifting (foremost being a timed freestyle session, the others being un-timed single/3 lap trials respectively). All masterfully crafted, resonating a 'hitman GO' kind of ambience.\nThere are another two dozen of these, and I found everyone of them enjoyable.\n\nThe Events, were rather challanging while the free roam challanges known as "Missions", were far too forgiving. You could half complete a spin twice and it would register as succesfull, for example.\n\nThe Soundtrack is exceptional and worth the price of admission alone. I'm not being facetious, growing up in an era where albums sold for £15/$25 I would have happily dropped a tenner on this score. The music is perfect, sliding through a ceramic China town to C41 - On my way, everything just comes together.\n\nWorth noting that while the game isn't in a pre release state the devs are still actively pushing out content and patches, the creator has said this game was a labor of love, and it shows.\n\n9/10\n\nCould use more content and maybe a way to save and share footage.

There's even a lighthouse named Donut!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=493072488\n\nAt this point, the game's even taken its special anti-nausea edibles - so if you were put off by the camera in older Let's Plays (particularly during spins), give it another shot.\n\nOne thing I would like to see is a bit more interactivity throughout the open world - sure, there's challenges you can accomplish and ramps you can jump off of and stacks of blocks you can knock down, but there's not much you can do to change the layout of the levels; it would be neat if you could (for instance) trigger a crane to raise a wall by doing a donut around a lever, or create a ramp by knocking over some of its supports. That sort of thing would be really cool, but it would just be an enhancement on an already great game.","August 1, 2015","true","3.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","10","11","4","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/recommended/320140/","TheGameTutor","TheGameTutor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/","3112 products in account","Inspired by Ken Block’s Gymkhana series the best way to describe the game is the driving view point of micro machines, the score system of the trick sections in Project Gotham racing, the progression system of an N64 era platform game and a fantastic drift system that takes an age to master but always makes you feel it is your fault if you screw up.\n\nThe game sees you progress through a number of worlds that act as the hub to complete missions. These range from performing stunts around obstacles to performing on tracks to gain points and get a world ranking.\n\nThere are 3 types of events Driftkhana, Drifting, & Mountain Drifting but all are essentially a playground to gain as many points as possible. Controlled best with a gamepad the game takes about 5 minutes to understand, 10 minutes to become competent and even after several hours of game play I still did not feel I had truly mastered it.\n\nVisually the game is minimalistic but lovely to look at and run at a solid 60fps. The music soundtrack is also filled with tranquil base numbers.\n\nNow the game is not perfect. Relatively short I finished everything in a few hours and while trying to get higher up the league tables offers the game some replayability I feel that this will not be for everyone. I also felt that a more detailed tutorial to give tips on how to perfect drifting at the start as it took a lot of crashing into walls to really get the difference between how brake and handbrake acts.\n\nI enjoyed the game a lot and for the low price of £9.99 of your regional equivalent it is hard to not recommend but this isn’t a game which you will be playing for ages unless you really are a score attack gamer.\n\nCheck out our video review here http://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-grades/150731_game-tutor-grades-absolute-drift","July 31, 2015","true","3.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

My review.\nAt time of posting, I have all the achievements and have 50 hours in the game.\n\nFirst of all, just a general comment: I love this game. It has a great, smooth game engine and the controls are fairly easy to me. It wasn't too hard to pick up, and learning some drifiting from Assetto Corsa and driving my Miata IRL, I can say that the physics are very realistic and it's easy to apply those skills into this game.\n\n\nHere's a list for the TL:DR, and it's at the top (you're welcome):\nPros:\n\n- Smooth Game Engine\n- Difficulty Settings are Spot On\n- Controls on Every Difficultly Setting are Great\n- Music is Great (Especially C41; sorry Nyte, your music is still great, lol)\n- Colors are Great\n- Online Leaderboards\n- Fairly wide selection of Maps\n- Driftkhana, Drift Tracks, and Mtn Drift settings are awesome to choose from\n- Game is Updated at a Good Pace\n- Game as a Whole was Tailored for a Wide audience\n- Wide Range of Adjustable Graphics Settings to Fit your Performance Needs\n- Different cars fit different people, but aren't too unbalanced in terms of full capabilites.\n- Free-Roam. Yesssssss...\n- Less than 500 MB (currently)\n- Very Fair and Rewarding Point system that pushes you to try harder\n\nCons:\n\n- Non-customizable Controls (Steam Controller's Reprogramming Defeats this Con)\n- No-multiplayer, yet (for reasons)\n\nOtherwise, this game is perfect in my opinion.\n\n\nOkay, now the novel:\nPersonal Comments\n\nI have owned this game since August 2015 and have really been off and on with it. I can tell you that once I got a Steam Controller, everything changed, and I loved how the game played with it. Honestly, I couldn't play it on anything but the highest difficulty.\n\n\nPhysics\n\nThe physics are phenomenal. I don't think I have ever played such an arcad-ey styled game with such realistic physics. It totally replicates real life (or damn near it) and the developer did such a great job with it. From what I have seen, there are no current bugs in the game's physics and I see no reason for the physics to be modified at all.\n\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics are great aswell. I think that the color theme is perfect for the (not so much) "JDM/Dorifto" and (but more) Japan feel. It is a little brutal on the eyes when you're in a dark room or are very tired, but otherwise, it is very fun and keeps you alert. I really enjoy how the tire marks work. They really help when you are drifitng if you need to see if you're angle is going too far (genenrally more than 90º), and they look cool. The graphics, in general, may seem a little bland at times, but it really keeps you focused on what you're doing. Plus, this game isn't really about looks, it's more about the gameplay.\n\n\nGameplay/Controls\n\nAny kind of controller (I use a Steam Controller) is nearly a must. Keyboard is simply not enough to fully enjoy and get good at this game, but it is still playable. It really sucks that you can't change the controls in game, but the Steam Remapping or something like motioninjoy could help with that.\n\nThe actual controlling on all difficulties is great and accurate to their names. The hardest difficulty feels butter smooth and is what I use all the time. If you take your time, you can really learn the game and get good with a car that fits you. I personally work well with "The Original," but who knows what you might be great with. Also, there is always a mixture of challenging yourself, the music, and the map you're on that can give you different moods within the game.\n\nThis game is also very fun and easy to get back into and keep with. I think that in general, it may get boring after you completely master (rank 1) all of the maps and finish the campaign, but it would take a long time (probably no less than 150 hours) before you get to that point. At least for me, the game pushes me to try harder and be the best at any map I try. I am currently, as of this review, number 4 on Mt. Nikko with about 300,000 points to go to number 1. It's taken me about 15 hours to get to that point and I don't plan on stopping until I am at number 1.\n\n\nLast Words\nThis game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. I don't even think curse words can explain how awesome this game is. I think that the game has come a very long way in the past 9 months and I think that it has amazing potential.\n\nfunselektorlabs deserves a lot of credit for the creation of this game. I can't wait to see how this game evolves because it would be a shame if it were to stop where it is. However, it wouldn't be horrible because the game is already amazing as-is.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPoints System\nThe point system is very fair and I think I have it figured out, in general. Here's my thoughts:\n\n- Depending on drifting direction, a sideways-sliding score is given, and it's when the most rear wheel in a drift (if you're going right, it's the rear right) is farther out than the forward wheel (if you're drifting around a right corner, it's your left front, and vice-versa):\n\n- This is the general "drifitng score."\n- The wider the angle up to a 90º drift is more points\n- You get a multiplier based upon how long you have been drifing "continuously"\n- If you're going too slow, the points stop adding\n- If you go over 90º, the points stop adding\n- If you hit anything, except bonuses, your points are summed in the total and you lose your multiplier\n- If you stop drifing for too long (I think about 5 seconds), your points are summed in the total and you lose your multiplier\n\n- Extra points are given when you go around a bonus pole:\n\n- The closer you are, the more points you get\n- The faster you are going, the more points you get\n- If you're too far away or "aren't drifitng" near one, it doesn't count\n- If you hit one, it doesn't count, but doesn't get rid of your score or multiplier\n\n- Extra points are given when you hit a red block:\n\n- If you hit it you get points\n- If you don't hit it, you get no points\n- Faster and more Sideways you are, you get more points\n\n- Extra points are given when you go around a donut circle (driftkhana only):\n\n- If you finish the donut indicated with the increasing red circle, you get more points\n- Faster and more Sideways you are, you get more points\n- If you hit it, you get no points\n\n- Extra points are given when you spin in a "spin-zone" (driftkhana only):\n\n- If you finish the spinning indicated with the increasing red circle, you get more points\n- There's really no downside to these...\n\n- Points are inceased exponentially (I don't know how much the curve is) if you stack bonuses in one "continuous" drift:\n\n- If you keep getting bonuses, they'll exponentially increase\n- If your current score is reset, so does your bonus stack","May 11","true","54.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldershot/recommended/320140/","aldershot","[F!] Aldershot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldershot/","2454 products in account","Absolute Drift is an interesting top down car game, that focuses much more on drifting and the control of the car, rather than racing. You'll be doing your best to drift around corners, doing donuts, and fish tails in order to score as much points and to accomplish as much tasks as possible.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxeLgOZQWTw\nOnce in the game you'll be thrown into a somewhat open world where you'll be doing various tasks, such as ramp jumping, donuts, fish tails, and other drifting and driving challenges. Once the section of the map's tasks are complete, it'll open up new areas of the game. While exploring this semi-open world, you'll also be given the opportunity to enter one of it's many mini-missions where you'll be aiming for high scores on the leader board. The game also features multiple car models, and colour and pattern customization as well.\n\nThe biggest hurdle to Absolute Drift is it's learning curve. It's not an easy game to master and make little concession to beginning or even intermediate players. The controls are difficult at first, as the car feel very differnt from other driving games, and the ground feels something like ice. Spinning out and losing control of your car will probably be your first 30 minutes or more of your experiance. This might prove frustrating to players who don't play a lot of driving games (like me) but when you start to get the hang of things, and the small amounts of progress that you make in your driving ability really does feel rewarding. How ever, if you are a fan of driving games, it's focus on high teir play may very well be an attraction to you.\n\nThe game also looks great, as it's polished and clean look catches the eye, with it's minimalist design, with great music that suit the game's look and feel. Infact, the game's OST was one of the main motavators to push through the initial frustration of the controls. I just wanted to keep playing so I could keep listening to the amazing sound track.\n\nOverall, Absolute Drift is an interesting car game that I mostly enjoyed. I loved the presentation, I love the music, I love the concept. The only thing holding me back from enjoying the game to it's full potential is my sucky driving in combination with the game's extremly high learning curve.\n\nPros\n- Great visuals\n- Amazing sound track\n- An interesting concept\n- High teir driving fans would probably love the challenge level\n\nCons\n- Extremely high learning curve\n- Frustrating at times","July 30, 2015","true","2.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Sweet!\nNow jump over that lake! Awesome!\nGet them donuts going on that helipad! Cool!\n\nThat's basically it. There's a free-roam mode which consists of several zones with mini-objectives as well as separate events scattered around. Get to the zone, complete objectives, unlock the next one - repeat until you're the drift master.\nEvents are instances in which you can rack up your personal score and compete with other players via the leaderboards. You have 3 lap drift courses of varying difficulty, driftkhanas, which essentially are closed off arenas in which you race against time to get the highest score possible and you have drift tracks in which you go from point A to point B and get as many points as you can along the way.\nThe game is short, if you're aiming to 'complete' it. If you're here for the pleasure of drifting though, you can spend hours upon hours perfecting your skills.\n\nThe presentation is fantastic with very slick, clean and, most importantly, clear visuals. Music is very catchy and complements the picture in the best possible way.\n\nAll in all - if you like stylish visuals, racing and drifting, treat yourself with this little gem.","August 11, 2015","true","6.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/myknifeurlife/recommended/320140/","myknifeurlife","MyKnifeUrLife","http://steamcommunity.com/id/myknifeurlife/","115 products in account","Written after two free roam playthroughs using a controller once and keyboard once:\n\nAfter seeing this game on sale for the winter sale I decided that I should buy it. The two things that caught my eye were first, drifting. As someone who considers themself a fan of drifting I was really interested in the physics of how the drifting was especially in comparison to my favorite game to drift which is Forza.  The second thing is the art. The art behind the game is incredibly minimalist, the simplicity caught my eye because it rivals Mirrors Edge almost perfect in style and coloring.  That being said I took the dive on and indie game, which is something I do not do often.\n\nCurrently, I have spent most of my time playing the freeroam, and just want to address that as of now. I will certainly come back for an edit with more of my opinion based on the "events".  The freeroam alone is great. The settings within the game are really quite enjoyable while work perfectly with the concept of the game. The missions you do aren't to insane, most are easy and they are more of a relaxing type of fit for the game. As someone who generally likes games to be more difficult it was kind of disappointing, but it seems like that will really take affect later in the "event" section.\n\nThe physics of the game is amazing.  I really enjoyed how drifting felt from a top down view and found that it wasn't too difficult to grasp but was hard enough that I really liked to get to know the way it works.  I would say, that the physics are on par with other "simulation" games, like Forza. They are more forgiving certainly, but for this genre it works perfectly!\n\nThe other thing I would really like to talk about is the controls. I have seen some other reviews addressing them and say really this game is best with a controller and how the keyboard is definetly worse. So I started the game using a xbox one controller. I really enjoyed it and I found it was much easier to learn off the bat and was easily grasped.  The thing I would like to say is as great as the controller was, I personally enjoyed using my keyboard much more. For some reason, the controller felt much "slower" as in, i felt like the car it self was slow in response and speed (not in a bad way, it was just different than the keyboard), so when I played through a second time I decided to use the keyboard. The controls are extremely simple, the hardest thing is just getting used to how to multitask and use multiple buttons all at the same time.  For instance, it is weird using all of the arrow keys when counter-steering it is possible to oversteer or understeer so you have to make micro adjustments while still throttling and handbraking. So that was hard to grasp immediately, but after 10 minutes or so, it becomes great! I really enjoyed using the keyboard to play, actually even more than the controller.\n\nThe only con is the length of the game, it is quite easy to just zip right through the freeroam mode, but if you are someone who likes games that rely on leaderboards than this is certainly a good option.  Although it is short, I will say that replay value of free roam in my opinion is quite high because you wont remember all of the missions unless you have a photographic memory.\n\nOverall, if you are looking for a good drifting game with a great physics engine and beautiful art (including music as well) you have found it right here.  I would say this is a must purchase driving game!","January 4","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There isn't one aside being told to become "Drifting master" at the beginning.\n\n-Short campaign mode of 30-120 minutes depending how you play it.\n\n-Even though having minimalistic graphics i'd really like seeing some scenery around the maps.\n\n-Performance issues in couple of maps.\n\n-For casual play the price point might not be justified for the reasons addressed above.\n\n\nOverall: Really nice drifting game that hooks you in with it's mechanical play.","December 2, 2015","true","156.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you like "sim" drifting at all, you'll love this game. The mechanics are top notch, reward skill, punish beginners. There's a slight lack of content, but if you're at all competitive, you'll be spending hours trying to hit high scores. Otherwise, if you get a few hours out of it, it still works out cheaper than a movie. The free roam could potentially provide hours of fun inventing lines and runs, but sadly there's no score system so the competitive side of me runs back to try hit some top 8's.","August 2, 2015","true","11.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The two things that caught my eye were first, drifting. As someone who considers themself a fan of drifting I was really interested in the physics of how the drifting was especially in comparison to my favorite game to drift which is Forza.  The second thing is the art. The art behind the game is incredibly minimalist, the simplicity caught my eye because it rivals Mirrors Edge almost perfect in style and coloring.  That being said I took the dive on and indie game, which is something I do not do often.\n\nCurrently, I have spent most of my time playing the freeroam, and just want to address that as of now. I will certainly come back for an edit with more of my opinion based on the "events".  The freeroam alone is great. The settings within the game are really quite enjoyable while work perfectly with the concept of the game. The missions you do aren't to insane, most are easy and they are more of a relaxing type of fit for the game. As someone who generally likes games to be more difficult it was kind of disappointing, but it seems like that will really take affect later in the "event" section.\n\nThe physics of the game is amazing.  I really enjoyed how drifting felt from a top down view and found that it wasn't too difficult to grasp but was hard enough that I really liked to get to know the way it works.  I would say, that the physics are on par with other "simulation" games, like Forza. They are more forgiving certainly, but for this genre it works perfectly!\n\nThe other thing I would really like to talk about is the controls. I have seen some other reviews addressing them and say really this game is best with a controller and how the keyboard is definetly worse. So I started the game using a xbox one controller. I really enjoyed it and I found it was much easier to learn off the bat and was easily grasped.  The thing I would like to say is as great as the controller was, I personally enjoyed using my keyboard much more. For some reason, the controller felt much "slower" as in, i felt like the car it self was slow in response and speed (not in a bad way, it was just different than the keyboard), so when I played through a second time I decided to use the keyboard. The controls are extremely simple, the hardest thing is just getting used to how to multitask and use multiple buttons all at the same time.  For instance, it is weird using all of the arrow keys when counter-steering it is possible to oversteer or understeer so you have to make micro adjustments while still throttling and handbraking. So that was hard to grasp immediately, but after 10 minutes or so, it becomes great! I really enjoyed using the keyboard to play, actually even more than the controller.\n\nThe only con is the length of the game, it is quite easy to just zip right through the freeroam mode, but if you are someone who likes games that rely on leaderboards than this is certainly a good option.  Although it is short, I will say that replay value of free roam in my opinion is quite high because you wont remember all of the missions unless you have a photographic memory.\n\nOverall, if you are looking for a good drifting game with a great physics engine and beautiful art (including music as well) you have found it right here.  I would say this is a must purchase driving game!","January 4","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has solid controls when using controllers (which it is recommended to play with) and also suprisingly solid keyboard controls. For the sake if this review I tried out using a keyboard and even though it doesn't have the same feel to it and is a little harder, it still has that exciting wow factor when you string together drifts. If you to like to play indie games or have an interest in drifting get this game. You can do 3 different event types, Drift course, Driftkhana and Mountain drift with a free-roam mode that I would consider to be like a campaign You do missions to unlock different areas and different events. I think the 92% Positive reviews can vouch for itself seeing as this is a greenlight game.\n\nEdit- Oh and the audio is amazing too! Great songs it's edm and the engine sounds are spot on for a drifting game hearing the rpms going ham.","July 30, 2015","true","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The camera angle says arcade, the fine control of steering says sim, the overall physics say they don't know what they are - and I don't know either.\n\nWith the minimalist single-angle isometric style, they should have gone towards a challenging arcade experience, instead I got a frustrating blend of sim/arcade controls that is derived from what feels like a lightly modified UnityCar 2.0 asset package, which uses Pacejka curves and isn't great for drifting without code voodoo.\n\nThe game still has potential to be fun, perhaps alternate camera angles providing a better perspective of what is going on would bring out the game's arcade/sim mixture better and make the controls more enjoyable.

Obviously it is not a simulator because of top down, but the control is very focused on simulation. How does it work out as together? Not very well.\n\nThe game seems very easy-to-pickup, but it really isn't- you have to focus so much, the difficulty is as bad as simulator that requires actual good controller. Also, I felt that this game is incredibly slow paced. Maybe because of how much the camera zoomed out. So wiggled some setting, I also changed difficuly to easy (shamefully) and I felt no difference from Hard difficulty. Well there are no CPUs in this game, why does this difficulty thing exist for? Scoring??\n\nGraphic is sub-par, it is the modern "low-poly" style with very minimallistic color with very little environment. I've seen it enough of this, nothing really to praise for.\nMusic selection is great. I liked every bit of it, and it kind of connects as if there is DJ in background.\nThe control is the same as arcade style but asks you to play like simulator.\n\nThe worst part for me was the price tag. I mean, does it really worth $12? I can find numerous alternatives that may cost bit more but worth lot more than this.\n\nI tried to like it, yes, I needed to play for at least a hour to make a fair review but 20 minutes was enough torture for me. It was too challenging and really wasn't that entertaining. Some flash game plays better, and it is free.\n\nIf you play a lot of racing simulation, you might like this, but why pay for limited simulator when you might already have fully-controllable simulation game? That's the confusing part.\n\nIn my honesty, I don't feel like picking this up again after this review... sorry.","November 26, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

And spending a good few more hours in-game, I've managed to get top 10% on every single track in all three catagories and managed to finish all levels of free roam on keyboard. I revise my review and give it a thumbs up because while the learning curve is still imence and players using a controller do still have an inherent advantage, After many hours of playing (for such a simple game) I have managed to get a feel for it and do reletively well in the rankings. It's a fun game just don't expect a massive amount of playebility as the free roam is reletively short and once you've finished that it's all just getting better scores and rising in the rankings so if that's your kind of thing then go for it but if you're looking for a casual, easy drifting game with lots of potential playtime then look somewhere else because this game is hard and very competitive.","August 2, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has a nice art style were the map and track are white with a few brightly colored buildings to mix things up and your car is the paintbrush. The game is nicely optimized and I can definitly see someone playing this on an unplugged laptop (Provided you have and controller). The game is just soo fun i can't stress this enough. The game is easy too get into but hard to masterand you willl spend hours trying to get to the top of the leaderboard.  The physics of this game are awesome and you cant just go full throttle into a bend and expect not to spin out this isnt need for speed but this just emphasizes the fact the this game needs wheel support i think i would be much nicer if it did. The game also has a sense of humor in the way it presents itself and its tutorials and the names of the cars, and since it doesnt take itself too seriously and you can just fun with it.\nSo if like turbo whistle and slithering around a bend like your in Tokyo drift this is the game for you.\n","August 16, 2015","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You'll drift your car around curves and turns—at the speed you're comfortable with without losing control of the car—and chain together those drifts to increase both the base score and the multiplier. There are also many objects in the game world that you'll drift around (360 degrees), or brush up against (fly-by posts), or slam (break cubes), to increase your score during a drift.\n\nWhen you're at risk of losing the multiplier, and close to banking those points but having to start another streak, your running score total will shake and rumble to let you know you should quickly initiate another drift.\n\nThe game was made primarily by one person, so his vision for the game comes across in a cohesive manner. That is, all of the design decisions and gameplay mechanics feel natural and were implemented with the utmost care. This developer is responsive and kind. I've seen him aid people on the forums and help fix bugs they've encountered (the game is virtually bug-free, but there will always be edge cases). He even helped me one-on-one with a bug I was encountering.\n\nPossible negatives (these don't personally affect me)\n\n- The cars can be challenging to control in a drift. (I've also listed this as a positive.)\n- Wheels are not technically supported, although Xbox and PS4 controllers are natively supported.\n\nDefinite positives\n\n+ The cars can be challenging to control in a drift. (I've also listed this as a possible negative.)\n+ Six cars that all sound, look, and respond differently (you will encounter/unlock).\n+ Tutorials are built into your game's progression.\n+ If you hit a wall, you still keep your points! You'll have to begin another point streak though!\n+ Free-roaming mode with nooks and crannies, hidden stars (look like X's), and stunts.\n+ Car paint can be changed plus some decals applied.\n+ Down-tempo electronica soundtrack (3 hours).\n+ Field-of-view (FOV) is adjustable.\n+ Steering sensitivity, transmission type, and steering assist are customizable.\n+ Gorgeous art design.

Easy to get into but mastering it will take a while. There's your clichés.\n\nPros: Drifting (of course) plus you can quickly play a game or two or enjoy hours of frustrating sliding while honing your driving/score to perfection. Simplistic graphics work, it kinda reminds me of Mirrors Edge. I'm not sure but I think there's a little difference between vehicles. Quite alike but for a game like this, different enough.\n\nCons: Too few achievements: you need something more to draw you back day after day. Countdown before the race starts. Great idea, but it's very fast paced game and you end up restarting the race quite a few times when you're trying to beat your friends score. Three seconds is a long wait, too long. Should be: click restart, BOOM! GO! Also you should be able to change car without having to quit the race.\nOther than that, I enjoyed this very much, thank you!","August 5, 2015","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That being said, drifting in this game is extremely hard, as you spin out of control very easily. Although this may lower your hopes, when you have sort of conquered the ability to drift in this game, it's really fun. The race courses are all there, with time trial mechanics. There are also courses where you have to get points in a certain amount of time by drifting, spinning donuts, etcetera. Next to that, there's a free roam mode where you can explore quite a big world, all minimalistic and good-looking with quests to advance to the next area of said world (FYI, it's one big world. no loading screens whatsoever). Now, I would recommend this game, but there are two problems I have with it: the quests you have to do to advance to the next part of the world are extremely repetitive, and there aren't that many race/trick courses. For its price being 11,99, this really isn't much of a game. I WOULD recommend it if it's either on sale or cheap to get through retail. But yeah, for its price, the game is really short. I completed the free roaming mode in around 1,5 hours, and, like I said, there aren't that many other things to do next to break your previous record on racing or trick courses.\nTL;DR: Too expensive, recommended if cheaper.","September 5, 2015","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryuwex/recommended/320140/","ryuwex","#/","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryuwex/","227 products in account","As it's title suggests, this is a little game about drifting. It has minimalistic looks, the two dominant colors are red and white, with some blue here and there. The creator probably got inspired by Mirror's Edge's main menu, or he had the Japanese national flag in mind, since drift as a sport has Japanese origins, or both...\n\nWhat surprised me the most while playing is the fact that handling, and driving physics feel more realistic than most of the arcade racing games out there, I'd even dare to call it semi-simulation semi-arcade. The controls are tight, the cars are reacting well on every input. There are six vehicles in the game, they all resemble IRL models like the AE86, 240SX or the E30, and they all have somewhat different attributes. There is a 4WD van as well, and you can definetly tell the difference between RWD and 4WD.\nSeveral tracks are present in the game, everything has the name of a Japanese city or settlement, but i don't think there is any similarities other than that. You can do circuit drifting, downhill drifting, driftkhana (exactly like gymkhana). Other than that, there is a complete free-roam, that's basically the "career-mode" itself. The goal is to get through the "worlds" which are smaller segmets of a whole map. Every world has a theme: airport, sea-side village, industrial area, etc. In every world, there are certain amount of missions which must be done to be able to unlock the next area. These missions are simple, but fun. Examples are making donuts around certain objects, like a lighthouse, or an aeroplane, drifting under a forklift, and so on. As new areas are getting unlocked, you can find new cars, tracks as well.\n\nWhen you get to the end of the last "world", that's the end. What's left to do is having some fun in free roam without any  set goals, or practicing and competing against the world and friends leaderboard on the tracks.\n\nOne thing i have to mention, altough this is purely personal preference, is the awesomeness of the soundtrack. There are two artists featured, both with several songs. One of them produces more of an upbeat electro, the other one, which i enjoyed the most is mostly liquidfunk, chilly drum and bass.\n\nThis is a great little game, everything seem to work as intended, it's fun, it's unique on it's own way, however i could enjoy some more content in the future, or eventually a multiplayer mode.","January 1","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rather than a case of easy to learn hard to master, this slightly fiddly, really quite accurate, drift simulator is tricky throughout.  As someone who sends a fair bit of time sideways in real life, I'd say these guys have made a really good job of capturing that feeling of desperately trying to maintain angle in order to snap the rear back the other way and transition into another drift.\n\nThe game relies heavily on the desire to achieve that perfect run of 3 laps of well timed transition and big fast sweeping drifts.  Great until you actually manage said run, and then you're left feeling a bit lost as you're unlikely to ever best it, by much at least.\n\nA great toy, but requires something a little more in terms of aims/objectives/direction to make it into a truly great game.

I haven't tried it with a keyboard/mouse yet because of some warnings I've come across, so I cannot personally recommend a controller over a keyboard and mouse. I love the concept, infact, I love the game! The missions in Free Play are fun to do and fun to look for. The drift tracks and tutorials are setup very nicely. Even the games soundtrack is nice, some chill electro EDM music. All around the game is great.\n\nHowever... I can't seem to grasp the drifting mechanic. One moment I'm understeering, the next I'm spinning out of control with nothing but a wall to stop me. I'm glad crashing in this game doesn't result in failure, otherwise I would've stopped within 20 minutes. I feel like this game isn't something I'll be hooked on forever though, sadly. This is only due to the fact that I'm much more interested in other genres. Anyways, don't buy this game looking for easy drifting is all I'm saying. It's challenging, yet fun!\n\nEDIT: I've gotten about 80 minutes into the game and I've made it to the beginning of World 5. The game has a great variety of cars and customization. More than you would think it would have! I am getting the hang of the drifting and other tricks and it is now a much easier game; and it got more fun than before.\n\nUnderstanding the mechanics is quite strange... it's like I'm understeering and oversteering at the same time. If you're trying to go for a long drift, don't go too hard on the gas, you will spin out very quickly. Always use the handbrake unless you're going to fast to a wall, then you should hard brake.\n\nAnyways; this was the greatest $11 I've ever spent!\n\nEDIT: I've got around 140 minutes into the game and I finished it. Not much replayability in my opinion. Just the same tracks and free roam courses you played in the story mode, which is quite dull if you ask me. I'm not saying I expect a huge story, but 2 hours of content? Really? Still an awfully fun game and I spend more money on things that last for 10 minutes, so I'm not complaining.","August 9, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And spending a good few more hours in-game, I've managed to get top 10% on every single track in all three catagories and managed to finish all levels of free roam on keyboard. I revise my review and give it a thumbs up because while the learning curve is still imence and players using a controller do still have an inherent advantage, After many hours of playing (for such a simple game) I have managed to get a feel for it and do reletively well in the rankings. It's a fun game just don't expect a massive amount of playebility as the free roam is reletively short and once you've finished that it's all just getting better scores and rising in the rankings so if that's your kind of thing then go for it but if you're looking for a casual, easy drifting game with lots of potential playtime then look somewhere else because this game is hard and very competitive.","August 2, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However on the flip side, the game has a great visual style, good soundtrack (depends on what music you like), a nice feel to the car (rather easy to enter drift and hard to leave) and finally what extends the life of this game which are the events you can enter which are pretty much drift tracks. Unless you have a drive to finish high on the leaderboards or master a track, this mode won't offer much to you.\n\nSo in all, perhaps the posetives justify the price tag.

Rather than a case of easy to learn hard to master, this slightly fiddly, really quite accurate, drift simulator is tricky throughout.  As someone who sends a fair bit of time sideways in real life, I'd say these guys have made a really good job of capturing that feeling of desperately trying to maintain angle in order to snap the rear back the other way and transition into another drift.\n\nThe game relies heavily on the desire to achieve that perfect run of 3 laps of well timed transition and big fast sweeping drifts.  Great until you actually manage said run, and then you're left feeling a bit lost as you're unlikely to ever best it, by much at least.\n\nA great toy, but requires something a little more in terms of aims/objectives/direction to make it into a truly great game.  If you like your sideways this is definietly worth a look, as long as you are prepared to persevere long enough to glean some satisfaction from neat drifts!","January 1","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Love how the base drops out of the music when you're airborn, and then comes back when you're on your wheels (makes the jump feel more epic).\n\nOnly one real complaint.  For some reason there is a lag between the inputs on the controller and the game in general (even in the menus).  Don't know if it's just my machine, or not.

Let's see; its like Micro Machines meets Mirrors Edge with a soundtrack that takes me back to the early Test Drive and NFS days. Dead simple to pick up and play, but incredibly challenging to master..\n\nThe areas in free-roam are large and diverse, flowing seamlessly from industrial districts to twisty mountain passes, which keeps things interesting throughout the map. Each car also has very different handling characteristics, which makes it possible for each person to find their perfect car for different events.\n\nVisually the game is crisp and clean, dare I say almost elegant in it's minimalistic nature. Because 95% of it is white, it is tricky to see where the track is going uphill or downhill, but even that becomes a moot point once you get used to it.\n\nThe way each vehicle slides is surprisingly realistic, with all the usual drift ideas working as you could expect in first-person driving simulators; slamming anchors in the middle of a slide will allow the car to drift out wider, flooring the accelerator with a high angle drift will spin you out more often than not, even the steering feels like the vehicle weight actually transfers fore and aft, allowing for some pretty spectacular moves while flicking the car around tight bends...\n\nAll in all, this game is put together incredibly well.

YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.\n\nThe game plays very smoothly and despite some complains about the keyboard controls in the reviews I find it to be ok. It plays similar to some other games concerning the "Racing"-genre.\nThe minimalistic design paired with the soundtrack, a mix between soothing Drum & Bass and tender EDM, gives you a phenomenal game experience. You'll notice that you leave a trail of rubber behind you but the best thing is: It doesn't even stop when you're in the air! Someone mentioned that in one of the reviews but I think that this is such a great thing! If you start turning mid-air you'll see how and it just looks so very very pretty as well!\nThe game's learning curve is pretty much just rising. You'll learn new maneuvers as you progress in the game and for sure ones you did not get teached by the game itself. The missions in the Free-Roam mode are (somewhat) forgiving which is great for beginners and no bad thing at all!\nEach of your vehicles has an own sound for the motor as well which is a minor thing but still worth mentioning.\n\nOh - the events!\nThey are SO much fun! If there is a track you really like you will even catch youself spending 10 minutes if not even 1 hour or more trying to perfect your score and getting your global rank up on that specific track. The music also helps when you are grinding in one of the levels and if you want to stop you can just do that and mess around in the Free-Roam mode.\n\nThe Free-Roam mode let's you do whatever you want with your drift machine. [spolier]You can jump over ramps, destroy blocks, donut around helicopters or just speed up a mountain track. Or you can just drive up a ramp and fly straight into the water to hear that cute splashing sound! [/spoiler]\n\nI don't know if I forgot anything about the game and I hope that the devs will add more events or even new worlds or cars to the game. I'm really excited for what is going to come.\n\n\nIf I had to rate it on a scale of 10 I'd give it 10/10 *insert funny joke about the game encouraging drunk driving here*","August 15, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had been following this for a couple months leading up to release anxiously awaiting. And it has not disappointed. First off; the drift physics are exactly what you'd want. Throttle is pressure sensitive, allowing you to be very precise with how hard/soft you push the car in a drift. Car sounds are crisp and vary from car-to-car. Handbrake is applied JUST right; some arcade driving games have handbrake engage WAY too strong and sling shot you around. I really dug the Mirror's Edge-like minimalist graphics theme, with red colored items being important against a white backdrop. The game is a bit short w/ 5 "worlds" each with 20 or so challenges to complete that don't take long at all to run through.

This is good considering the viewpoint, so handling feels rather good. The two cars that I have played with so far feel quite different, and sound different, which is a nice change compared to most car games these days.\n\nControls: Arcade styling, crisp, and responsive, exactly as a game like this should be, although I haven't found a need to countersteer as much as the game insists you should yet. 9/10\n\nGraphics: Top down, flat styling, no fluff on the backgrounds, or track surfaces. This is great because nothing takes away from what you should be paying attention to. I would like to see more customizable options on the cars, maybe allowing custom paint schemes. 8/10\n\nSound: The sound between cars is great, though the blow off valve on the first car can get a little annoying at times. 8/10\n\nConclusion: I definitely recommend this game even in its early stages, the developer is quick to respond, and is very friendly. I see big things happening here, so this will definitely be one of the games to continue to keep an eye on if you are on the fence.  I would like to see multiplayer added, coop at the bare minimum, but a group of 10 cars drifting in tandem would be absolutely amazing.","July 29, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As the name suggests, the focus is on drifting, not lap times. The controls are good with the Xbox 360 gamepad and getting used to the drifting mechanics are what's most difficult. From there, it's drifting accurately that becomes the game since many courses are tight and don't allow much room for error.\n\nThe soundtrack is great, the visuals are unique and refreshing, and it's easily one of those games where you can play a couple of quick sessions or play for hours trying to top your high score. There's no multiplayer, but there is a good leaderboard and after each session you'll know what you scored and how you rank worldwide.\n\nMy only problem is limited customization of the cars - you can change between a few basic paint colours and patterns, and there are only six cars. Each car has its own unique characteristics and chances are you'll only end up using a couple for the majority of your runs. Given the leaderboard system, I don't expect performance modifications, but greater visual customization would be nice, although it's far from being a gamebreaker.\n\nThe core game itself (the free-roam mode) can be finished very quickly (like, an hour), it's the pursuit of accuracy and precision that keeps you coming back. It's a casual game, but you need to play it more than casually if you want to link up sweet drifts through a complete tour of a track.","December 30, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To summarize my feelings about it: it was a perfect delivery.

You'll drift your car around curves and turns—at the speed you're comfortable with without losing control of the car—and chain together those drifts to increase both the base score and the multiplier. There are also many objects in the game world that you'll drift around (360 degrees), or brush up against (fly-by posts), or slam (break cubes), to increase your score during a drift.\n\nWhen you're at risk of losing the multiplier, and close to banking those points but having to start another streak, your running score total will shake and rumble to let you know you should quickly initiate another drift.\n\nThe game was made primarily by one person, so his vision for the game comes across in a cohesive manner. That is, all of the design decisions and gameplay mechanics feel natural and were implemented with the utmost care. This developer is responsive and kind. I've seen him aid people on the forums and help fix bugs they've encountered (the game is virtually bug-free, but there will always be edge cases). He even helped me one-on-one with a bug I was encountering.\n\nPossible negatives (these don't personally affect me)\n\n- The cars can be challenging to control in a drift. (I've also listed this as a positive.)\n- Wheels are not technically supported, although Xbox and PS4 controllers are natively supported.\n\nDefinite positives\n\n+ The cars can be challenging to control in a drift. (I've also listed this as a possible negative.)\n+ Six cars that all sound, look, and respond differently (you will encounter/unlock).\n+ Tutorials are built into your game's progression.\n+ If you hit a wall, you still keep your points! You'll have to begin another point streak though!\n+ Free-roaming mode with nooks and crannies, hidden stars (look like X's), and stunts.\n+ Car paint can be changed plus some decals applied.\n+ Down-tempo electronica soundtrack (3 hours).\n+ Field-of-view (FOV) is adjustable.\n+ Steering sensitivity, transmission type, and steering assist are customizable.\n+ Gorgeous art design. (I usually dislike minimalist art designs, but this one just ROCKS!)","August 1, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think it's underrated. One should really consider it on a sale.\n\nGraphics: Interesting simplistic concept.\nVehicle control: Sim-like controls but yet, somewhat arcady. Not very easy to control the car. Which is a good thing for this kind of game.\nMusic: Not my kind of music. Weird techno-pop-trance ♥♥♥♥ going on.\nCars: Several vehicles to choose from. They differ in speed and handling. You can paint cars and/or put stickers on them!\nLevel design: Absolutely perfect. In the main story (kind of) area, there are buildings, roads and objects scattered around for your pleasure. A lot of different objects to drift around, through, under and between. Then there are also drift tracks.\nThere are 3 kinds of drift tracks:\n*Mountain drift: No laps, you just go downwards while drifting as much as you can.\n*Driftkhana: No laps. A closed off area where you perform drift moves (donuts, jumps, slaloms, drifts) until the timer runs out.\n*Drift curcuit: Run 3 laps around while performing drift moves.\nDrifting: Collect points for each drift move. More angle and more speed mean more points. You can chain drifts. Careful for if you lose control, you crash. When you crash, you bank your current points but lose your streak.\nSingle player: There 6 areas, each requiring you to complete a number of tasks before unlocking the gate to the next area. Tasks vary between collecting things, completing certain drift moves, jumping over obstacles and some other stuff.\nMultiplayer: There are online leaderboards for all tracks. Try to go higher on each track and see how you fare compared to the general Steam population.\n\nFor the lack of good drifting games out there, and my love for drifting games, I give this game a solid 8/10. The reason for the 8 is, the lack of a proper story/mission/campaign thing, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ music.\n\nWarning, the game is very short. like I went through the whole thing in just under 2 hours, got all the achievements and all that ♥♥♥♥. So it's very, very short. But it's nice. It's a 'casual' game.","January 24","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Could probably be speedrun much faster. There's a bunch of drift and driftkhana tracks each with their own leaderboards, so the competitive leaderboard types of players will probably get much more than 90 minutes out of this game. The drift mechanics seem mildly accurate, for a really low-grip world.\n\nUnfortunately the goal detection is kinda dodgy. Where you have to do donuts around an object, you actually just have to be drifting a certain angle, not even in the correct direction, within some radius of the object. You'll accidentally half-complete some objectives driving past it. Drifts to complete objectives don't have to be successful, you can slide past, tick off an objective, and then slam into the wall (the exception to this is that actually hitting clipping points doesn't give points, and donking donut objects sometimes resets them). The result of all this is that you can basically fumble your way through the whole game (you do gotta git gud for the leaderboard modes though).\n\nAlso there's a difficulty setting that seems to do nothing. I don't even know.\n\nAll up - it's a fun little toy, but it's not really a complete product.","December 24, 2015","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The soundtrack is pretty solid for the fact that it's a drifting game, it definitely fits the game well. The game controls very well, any time you hit a wall, spin out, or lose a drift for any reason, it is YOUR fault, not the game's.

Still, the game is fun and addictive, features cool looking car replicas, has some pretty good car customisation options and is really, really popular right now. Pick it up on sale if you can cause if I'm honest, you won't regret buying this game.","April 3","true","31.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This isn't about racing -- it's all about style. You'll find yourself chaining together long, satisfying drift turns while letting the techno soundtrack clear your mind of anything else.\n\nThis a small game, whose exploration mode can be cleared in under two hours. However, that mode is really a side-show. This game is about high scores.

The challenges are not hard and you can even aim for higher ranks in global leader boards with a minimum effort.\n\nOverall this game is definietly worth a try if you want to try a driving game based around drifting.","August 15, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
