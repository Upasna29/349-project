Its design is simple and clean, very attractive and easy on the eyes. Design economy is very well-adjusted, almost every mechanic is cleanly demonstrated through gameplay. The platforming and puzzles are both very good in their fields, and merge incredibly well to form a great hybrid gameplay. The platforming momentum feels responsive and tight, allowing you to execute the solutions to puzzles without being infuriated by the character's mobility (or lack thereof). The learning curve is spectacularly gentle, especially for an indie puzzle-platformer. Everything is introduced in turn and you get time to play with every mechanic in isolation before needing to combine them to solve complex challenges. See that bizarre-looking trailer up there? You'll understand everything going on in there to an intuitive level after playing.\nThe chiptune soundtrack is fantastic.\nThis game is an absolute steal at $5 and it's currently on sale for $4.","May 18","true","3.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Nothing fancy there.  What makes it shine is the surprisingly large number of unique mechanics, plus all the cool tricks that can be done with them.  You'll always just be in a one-screen void with various types and numbers of lasers, but the sheer variety of objects keeps the game from feeling too repetitive.\n\nIt helps that the game regularly tosses new mechanics at you.  Just when you've learned about all there is to learn about the current set of lasers and tools, out pops something else to change everything up.\n\nThere are some definitely frustrating bits, though.  There were a few levels where I never knew precisely what I was doing (in particular Windmill), and I wasn't sure if I had actually solved the level or if I had actually just tripped facefirst into what the game accepted as a solution.  And I am unfortunately currently stuck on what I imagine is the very last level of the game, and even after spending over an hour messing with it, I feel no closer to actually finding the solution.  (Though in all fairness, this could be due to simple badness on my part.)\n\nOn the whole though, it's a fun time, and I've no regrets on spendIng five bucks on it.  It could do with some better formatting on the level select, and it'd be nice to be able to skip a level I'm stuck on.  But hey, there's plenty of good puzzles, it gave me some fun moments.  I do enjoy feeling like I "cheated" a level by finding a solution that I don't think was originally intended.  So hey, maybe give the game a shot, you'll probably like it.\n\n...\n\noh and the soundtrack is kinda awesome too","May 21","true","5.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There were many instances where I was completely stumped as to what I was supposed to do. It takes a few tips from the books of other platformers and adds a few incredibly unique spins on them. Whereas INK left me wanting more, I felt like an incredible sense of fulfillment after completing the game. This is a game that simultaneously demands that you take your time and train your reflexes. Also, there's a level builder; that alone is worth the price of admission.\n\n10/10","May 29","true","9.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game manages to push its core mechanic in mind-blowing ways throughout the campaign without any unfair difficulty spikes. The level design needed to accomplish this is beyond impressive and gave me nonstop "aha" moments.\n\nAs with most indie platformers, this game's music is a blast and the controls are tight and precise. However, unlike most indie games at this price-point, I was blown away by how much content is included. It even comes with a level editor!\n\nOverall, this game is intuitive, challenging, and brillantly designed: 10/10","May 18","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Campaign is non-stop fun with the enormous amounts of levels, and the custom levels just adds on to that. Including a level editor was an amazing design choice from the Dev's because it adds so much more to the game. The sound track is top notch as well, it will be within my music library for a long time.","May 19","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
