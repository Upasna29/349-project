The demo left me wanting more, and Steam had it on sale, so off I went to get it.\n\nI'm on my second play through. The first play through was messed up beyond believe. I didn't know what was what and got stuck in a boss battle that I could not win. That bit frustrated me to no end and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off greatly. I went off in search for a guide to overcome the boss battle. To my dismay, none of the guide helps as I've done something I should not have done: killing everything in sight and trying to spread the EXP love with all my party members. The end result was a severly gimped party lacking in both stats and skills.\n\nI stopped playing for a couple of days and dived deep into the wiki. I learn the proper way to play the game, picked up a majority of the content that I just zipped past without realizing it, and focused on growing my party members the proper way. Second time around, the game was infinitely less infuriating and way more fun. The boss that I was stuck at in my first play through became a breeze, though the game did something rather nasty after that particular fight. Thank god I was somewhat prepared for it, equipped with both knowledge and power to overcome that nasty bit. The resulting satisfaction was very, very high.\n\nFrom then on, the game became something I want to explore in depth. I trawled through the wiki and its discussion pages to learn more about the mechanics of the game. Although I've been vigilant in keeping track of the missable content, there are still a number of things that I inadvertently got locked out of without realizing it. I am currently one boss fight away from the end of the game and already I am laying down the foundation for my new game plus.\n\nDespite the amazing depth of the game, or rather, due to it, the game will eat you alive if you don't know what you’re doing. The game does not make obvious certain crucial information from the get go. Playing the game with a lack of information can lead to a really bad experience, especially if you play this game the way you would a normal RPG.\n\nWith that said, the game is excellent for those wanting a good challenge. There is a vast amount of content within the game, and it should keep someone busy for the next 100-200 hours.\n\nUpdate (22 Feb 2014): I've just finished my third playthrough and I'm taking a break to plan for my fourth playthrough. It seems that once you've finished the game once, you just keep going back for more. This game is one of my best investments in Steam.","January 4, 2014","true","349.0"," 578 of 614 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","578","614","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovinglife139/recommended/23310/","lovinglife139","lovinglife139","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovinglife139/","1123 products in account","The Last Remnant is my favorite JRPG of all time, and definitely holds a place of my top 10 games of all time. Here's why.\n\nThis game is wholly unique. Usually, when one says "JRPG", you have a good sense of what you're getting into. Cliched characters (whether you like those cliches or not), quirky personalities, a turn-based battle system, a long convoluted story with plenty of twists, and be prepared to roll your eyes or shake your fist at the screen for some character antics or story twists you saw coming from early on. In The Last Remnant, little of this is true. The story is unique, the art style and characters are unique, some of the twists and story archs are surprising, and the battle system is so unlike anything else you've ever played, somewhere between a JRPG and a large scale strategy game with army simulation elements.\n\nThis game is known to be quite challenging. I bought the Xbox 360 version on the game's release date, and have beat the game a few times and put a couple hundred hours into it. After completing my first PC playthrough tonight after about 90 hours, I can say for certain the PC version is about 3000% easier. An update was made to the game that made a few changes that made the PC version exponentially easier, though it is still more challenging than the average RPG. So if you happened to try the 360 version and were turned off by its difficulty, I urge you to try the PC version.\n\nThe Last Remnant needs to be commended for its ability to have realistic and relatable characters, and multiple characters you care about and will remember forever. In this game, you are able to literally build up a small army to take into battles with you, where enemies and your people are separated into "unions" rather than each person being separate from one another. It is here where the game brings in large-scale strategy type battles, allowing the unions to act as one unit. Strategy fans will delight in the ability to hire soldiers and characters for their army, picking and choosing people based on their unique skill sets and abilities. You are able to hire people you've perhaps done quests with, or people you've never met that happen to have a skill you've never heard of, just because you want to see it in action. You then pick and choose which people to put with whom, how to set up your unions, etc., giving limitless possibilities for your army. Also, your followers will often ask for certain items, ingredients, etc. throughout the game, which they'll use to upgrade their equipment and become even more badass. (And trust me, this game is full of badass characters.) You can also dictate how your soldiers level up, as they ask you from time to time if you want them to delve into a different skill set or art style.\n\nEven if the game had a terrible story and cliched characters, the battle system would keep me crawling back. Battles are by far the best part of this game. While some will say that some boss battles can be "cheap" or "unfair," I'd argue that your characters also unlock plenty of abilities and special moves that are just as if not more cheap or unfair to the enemy (Blackout is ridiculously powerful, for example, and that's a move my unions ended up using frequently). In summary, fights can be nail-biting, because you are constantly reminded that you are fighting enemies that are just as skilled and able as you. Will you still scream at the game in frustration? Sometimes, yes. But I've personally also nearly broken things with excitement when a single decision or a stroke of luck turned the tide of battle. Also, I'll let it be known that I find games that are hard just to BE hard quite annoying and to be little to no fun. This is not a game that is consistently cheap or unfair. It can be extremely challenging, and you'll call BS on a fight from time to time, but with strategy, that same fight on your next try could be immensely rewarding and much simpler.\n\nThe Last Remnant is a refreshing game in a genre that is usually predictable. It has a gritty realism that is usually reserved for western RPGs. It also respects its characters. You'll find no little girls with parasols fighting in battle, nor will you have a guy insist on being shirtless while on the battlefield (seriously...whenever I see that, I think about how easy it'd be to take them out). The characters--while they can be quirky and humorous at times--are never walking cliches. Each woman or man has her or his own personality, back story, goals and motivations--and YOU get to decide whether or not to add them to your army and help them grow over time.\n\nThis game is a true gem. It is nothing less than a crime that a game of such originality is not mentioned in conversations of JRPGs more often. This is the JRPG that I hold every other JRPG up to--and until we get another game in this universe, I see no other game coming close. I cannot recommend this game enough.","October 14, 2014","true","105.1"," 366 of 381 people (96%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","96","366","381","8","23"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/recommended/23310/","doomsdayforte","DF","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/","936 products in account","I bought The Last Remnant for $3.74 in 2011, and it took me four years to finally get around to playing it.  It took me 99 hours to get to the end because I went out of my way to do all of the important sidequests, so if you're not interested there, you can be done much faster.  There's also a demo if you want to try a bit of the game out for yourself.  I played the game entirely with the Xbox360 controller.\n\nThe Last Remnant is a type of strategic RPG that masquerades as a standard JRPG.  There's a lot that it does differently than compared to a JRPG, but then it's also pretty different from your standard SRPG too.  Or tactical.  Whatever.  I've seen it compared to Ogre Battle and I've heard that TLR was originally a SaGa game, but I haven't played anything in either series so this game stands as quite unique for me.  The story is kinda all right, I liked being able to go back to the city sector screen from anywhere in town, and there are a few catchy battle themes.\n\nCombat is a fairly different affair compared to the typical "everyone stands in a line and makes hitting motions at the enemy" kinda game.  Instead of having between three and five people out at once to save the world, you field a max of 18 in the second half of the game, though it's not entirely as though everyone's running around doing their own thing.  You put your characters into small parties of up to five members each, or unions, where everyone pools HP and AP for special moves--but the enemy does it too.  This is a game where positioning and attacking the enemy's side is important, but unlike grid-based strategy RPGs, you can't directly order your your unions into a position to trap enemies.\n\nThe game works on a Deadlock mechanic.  Basically, two opposing unions meet on the battlefield and fight it out until one of them is dead.  At least you can break Deadlock to attack another group or heal, and the enemy can't.  But the idea is that both groups are focused on only the other, so you can have another group attack that preoccupied enemy group to flank them, and continue to gang up on them to get further damage and morale bonuses.  Of course you're vulnerable to being flanked, so it's generally a good idea to assign everyone their own target, and to target the flunkies in boss battles first since everyone focusing on the boss first leaves everyone's back open.\n\nThere's also the morale feature to keep in mind.  Unions have their own Limit Break-styled morale meter, but there's one at the top of the screen that affects both sides of the battlefield.  Most battles start with it in the middle where neither side benefits, but one side getting an advantage will result in better combat performance.  Enemies appear in the field and you're given an opportunity to initiate combat (on top of trying to draw as many into one fight for a higher challenge and more rewards), but if they catch you, they'll start with a free turn and the bar in their favor.  A stat buff for the majority and a stat debuff for the minority sounds insignificant, but it's very noticeable in practice.  Some tougher enemies will use devastating attacks when they control the morale bar, so shutting them down is a top priority.\n\nThere are QTEs during battles.  I know some of you are rolling your eyes already, but I like to think of it closer to a timed-hits mechanic versus "press this button to not die" like in some games, since the prompt comes up during the same part of the animation.  The chance for the prompt is tied to the battlefield morale, and during an attack, you're given one of five buttons (default A, B, X, Y, and right trigger for X360 controls).  Successfully press the right button in time and the next person on your side in that Deadlock will leapfrog to the top of the action queue and do their move, getting another prompt.  Hit all of the prompts to finish the combo and the last person on your team will attack with a guaranteed critical hit.  There's a prompt when being attacked too--parrying results in a stun, blocking with a shield results in a damaging shield bash, and evading results in a heavily-damaging counter attack.  Given battles are largely an affair of picking orders and then watching everything play out, this does keep things kinda engaging, though you can also set the game to handle the prompts for you at a lower success rate.\n\nWhen it comes to control, there's not a lot that's in your hands.  You're given a choice of up to five orders per union, ranging from "attack with your weapon!" to "use Combat Arts!", but you may not get the prompt to heal or revive somebody when you really need it.  And even if you do pick "use Combat Arts!", that doesn't mean everyone in the union actually will, even if they have enough AP.  Some of it is down to union composition, though there's also union morale to consider.  You can at least turn off individual arts if you don't want people using them.  You can't directly give any equipment to anybody except the protagonist, Rush.  There's an .ini edit to circumvent this, though that has its own hangups.  There's a pretty robust item creation/upgrade system, but your characters can only request things you have in your inventory already and they may not ask for or even use things that logic states they should.  You can assign unions their own formations, but you can't exactly move people away to avoid the big boss' area-of-effect attack, so you have to hope that everyone is standing in the right place to not get torn apart.\n\nThe only real problems I had with the game were texture pop-in and laggy gameplay, even on a solid-state drive.  Cutscenes weren't immune to this either, but at least you could pause to let everything load, or pause and then skip them if you wanted.  The game was also more difficult than I'd consider other JRPGs or the like, though I wouldn't put it up there with the hardest games in the genre.  A lot of it can be avoided by setting your teams up well, though there's still a luck element involved.  This is also one of the few games I've played where trying to do all of the major sidequests makes the final boss significantly harder.  Given you have to beat a very difficult boss for that 100% completion before a certain part of the story, it's not really suggested to attempt this on your first time through--there's a New Game Plus feature so try it on your second loop.  I kinda hurt my enjoyment of the game by having to grind out because of my unknowing mistake.\n\nBut despite all that, I really did enjoy my time with The Last Remnant.  I've never quite played anything like it, and while there isn't as big a drought for JRPGs on PC now as there was in 2011, this game is certainly unique enough to be a keeper in my book.  If you have any interest in the game at all, you really should try the demo out.  It manages to be a fun experience without falling back on established Final Fantasy references or the like.","September 3, 2015","true","99.2"," 110 of 117 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","110","117","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nabutso/recommended/23310/","nabutso","Nabutso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nabutso/","93 products in account","I got into this because I heard of a $100 prize being offered to anyone who streams and beats this on vidyashorts. This challnge had been going on for years, with the prize getting higher and higher. You'd think if someone is paying for you to play a game it must be either ♥♥♥♥, or they're just a rabid fan of it.\n\nA few hours in, I understood entirely why someone was willing to pay to have someone play through it. This was an incredible game that gave me the same vibes that Dark Souls did when I first played it. It had challenge to it, but at the same time I had never heard of it. Watching someone go through the hard times just like when you did on your own play through, watching someone play TLR must be incredible.\n\nGoing into The Last Remnant without the wiki open makes it hard, but rewarding. Every challenge you overcame felt more rewarding than the last. Not just because you're clearing things, but because the game always rewards you in some ultimately useful way; not how you'd expect from a "typical" JRPG. You do the side quests, you end up with good party members, access to newer areas (or expanding upon ones you have unlocked already), and even the ability to use more skills for Rush, the main character. While going off and doing your side adventures, you're running into harder and harder challenges - rare monsters are (fairly) abundant, and you get the urge every time you see a green name to fight it. Who cares if you lose? You can save anywhere.\n\nIt got easier towards the end because I had take a tip that fighting more monsters at once meant you got more rewards than fighting smaller groups, even if the total monsters defeated during a trip into an area was the same. I skipped a lot of fighting, instead juking around monsters. There are no random encounters, so your progression as far as "levels" (Battle Rank) is entirely up to you. This game has level scaling; if you level up too much, the fights get harder. This isn't a problem if you aren't purposefully grinding or you're good at dealing with groups of monsters, to help increase your gains.\n\nThe story feels like it has odd pacing because of the way that side quests open up during it. Keep in mind if you're stuck and don't know what to do, talk to the guys behind the counter in any pub. They'll tell you about side quests, and typically you'll find the next story trigger in there, if you're lost on where that could be.\n\nI didn't fight the superbosses, but they exist. After beating the game, there is a NG+ which allows you to enable hard mode. Normal fights can last a long time, too. I fought rare monsters which required 30 min just for one attempt at it. When I got the hang of things and became stronger relative to what the game expected, the fights got easier and shorter. Never faceroll, though, except for a few isolated cases.\n\nThis game, while it is a JRPG, doesn't contain the expected JRPG elements you're used to. This is good both for longtime fans of JRPGs who can still play it and enjoy the elemtns which it keeps, as well as for people who aren't really into JRPGs. Nothing silly like buying a new weapon you saved all your gold for just to find it in a chest in the next 'dungeon'. You don't wear armor, just a weapon, shield optional, and 2 accessories.\n\nThis is one of those games where you really like the characters because they are actually useful. Random quest at the start of the game gives you access to a bad-♥♥♥ who you wish you could take out for drinks irl because of how much he helped you early on. Guy from another quest who "isn't much of a fighter"? You get him too, and hes some ultra badass as well. Cute girls with big swords, old men who will die for you, giant silent warriors, a previous villian and his "dog". These are just a few of them. They help you get through the game in more ways than one. Almost every character has their own storyline of some sort, and you wish you could keep them all!\n\nTook me 70 hours, completing the story + tons of side quests (no superbosses, skipped some near the end because I was enjoying the story); but only about 70% of the game's total content.\n\nPlays best on mouse and keyboard. Oh, and turn auto camera follow off, so you can look around easier at the great landscapes while you're exploring them.\n\n\nStory: 7/10 ~ The pacing, since side quests are so fun, ends up being odd. However, the story itself is good when you're actually doing it.\n\nGraphics: 8/10 ~ For a 360 game, it looks good. The battle effects arent bad, in fact, they're really satisfying. Magic isn't as fun as melee combat though. No native anti aliasing.\n\nFun - 9/10 ~ I went into it expecting some marginally entertaining dynasty warriors-meets-FF thing. I got something much better than that. With genuinely satisfying gameplay, I never turned turbo mode on. I left critical triggers to auto and still enjoyed 90% success; I got to sit back and relax as I watched my units do the commands I gave, coming up with my strategy for the next turn. Having your units make a big play to win a very difficult fight is amazing.\n\n$ value - 9/10 ~ You'll be playing this a long time if you want to explore it all. I typically played in sessions of 3-8 hours, of which, only 1/3rd was story related. Rarely can you spend $10 and get a 50+ hour game nowadays. Estimate over 100 hours+ if you do not 'cheat' (read wiki, guides). I encourage you to avoid the wiki unless you're in dire straits.\n\n\nOverall, a 9/10 JRPG that you better recognize.\n\nThanks, Peaches, for gifting this to me.","October 10, 2015","true","94.9"," 118 of 129 people (91%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","91","118","129","11","3"

Despite my inability to get past a boss fight around 80 percent of the way through the game, I really enjoyed it, so I was glad to see this game on Steam.\n\nI was even more glad when I started to play TLR again and realized a couple of things: it's a lot easier if you understand the skewed leveling system (and I'll get to that in a second) and the PC version has made a lot of interesting quality of life improvements to the game. Really, it feels like the only thing missing from the PC version is... achievements. (Okay, actually, my other complaint would be that whomever did the cutscene animation has apparently never watched a living person walk before because the modeling is terrible but -- that's minor.)\n\nSo back to the leveling system. TLR is really interesting in that it removes all control from the player in terms of leveling characters and, to a certain extent, control over a character's actions in battle. So while the lack of control will take some getting used to I actually think the battle system is really fun, if unique. The leveling system, however, causes problems. Essentially TLR has two leveling stats: individual units/character stats (which the game auto-levels/assigns for you) and battle rank, which levels your entire party/army. What I didn't realize the first time I tried the game on the 360 was that having a high battle rank is... actually really bad. The higher the battle rank, the longer it takes for stat increases and the harder the enemies are to beat (to the point where if you have too high a rank, like I did, a boss battle literally becomes a one-shot and completely impossible encounter). So, I'm definitely having a much better play-through on the PC because (a) the PC version seems to have reduced some of the connection between battle rank and difficulty and (b) despite how counter-intuitive it is to NOT level in a RPG, I've managed to keep my battle rank pretty low.\n\nThat said, the game has an interesting storyline (that I'm eager to finally finish) and is definitely a completionist's nightmare. The main questline is actually fairly short but there's a MILLION sidequests and a couple hundred challenge quests (e.g., kill a specific monter, find a particular item, gain a specific level, etc.) so there's a ton of stuff to do.\n\nIf you have a good 40-50 hours to kill, you like the idea of transhumanism, and you like SquareEnix, or just JRPGs, I definitely recommend this one.","November 1, 2014","true","53.1"," 84 of 90 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","84","90","5","4"

The game increases the stats of enemies and decreases the xp received and the chance to increase one of your characters stats. This wouldn't be so bad but the BR sticks no matter who is in your group (or union or whatever they want to call it) so if you level up your main character and the first couple party members in the early part of the game then every party member you get later will be ridicilously weak with no real way to level them up to where they should be.\nHonestly, google "the right way to level up" (skipping the fact a game shouldn't need an explanation of how to freaking level up) with The Last Remnant and they will all say to "avoid as many fights as possible".

I remember getting stuck somewhere and giving up. Basically without the updated wikiI was not understanding the inticacy of many aspects of the game. The gmae lacks a tutorial for many important aspects of the game and once hindered the ability for some to get into the game. (There really should be a link to the wiki in the description of the game or something because without it I would never have enjoyed it so much.)\n\nPros\n+ Story - The story isn't actually all that bad. While it definitely has its ups and downs, as a whole it changes some of the same old broing troupes of JRPS, while keeping others. The dialogue and voice actors sometimes help make the story predictable, but there are some neat twists and some great characters.\n+Gameplay - The game is remanisent of an MMO and traditional JRPG in that there is an overworld map, which you can choose a location to go to. You are then entered into a 3D enviroment where you can move and see enemies running around, like an MMO or Chrono Trigger. You enter combat by engaging with the enemies on these fields and to help do that you have a special ability that allows you to slow time and link enemies together to fight at once, or manipulate in other ways (like avioding them). The combat system is great for seasoned JRPG fans. Its great fun and sometimes great strategy. You can enter towns and go shopping, grab new quests, do guild tasks, and talk to randoms.\n+Graphics - For a game thats getting older, the URE3 hold up decently, not ground breaking by any means. Environments are beautiful and fairly detailed, and there are a lot of them.\n+Completion - It takes over 60 hours to 100% this game. Took me double that. The list I went by is:\n1. All Quests\n2. All Guild Tasks\n3. All Weapon Upgrades Maxed\n4. Rank 8 Conqueror\n5. All Arcana Abilities (because they are awesome)\n\nFor completing the game you get a new game +. For doing all of those individual things, you should get a lot of items to carry over and a gold bonus, as well as proving you can take down the badest of the bad in the normal game.\n\nCons\n- Story - Short imo. But I guess thats not so bad see as how this game took days of my live away.\n-Graphics - Even after years the game still suffers from texture pop ins and Rush's skirt....wtf\n-Gameplay - Battles can feel tedious many times over. Sometimes you will get frustrated with certain enemies, most in the story mode. White Conqueror took me 5 attempts. No minigames :(.\n-Completion Bonus - All the purple shiny items you get are just Trophies for when you play the new game + mode. That sucks. Also no achievements.\n\n\nI really liked this game my second time through.

The union system allows you to control groups of characters by issuing a single command and while it might seem simplistic, the way you arrange your groups and what abilities you select for each character to use in combat makes it much more interesting, and the way your characters evolution isn't directly decided by the player, but rather managed by what you do makes it very immersive. As the player, you will need to pay attention to what a character's actions are in order for them to become stronger. Also the boss fights can resemble alot what an MMORPG boss fight is like, as you should assemble specific groups of characters, such as a group of healers and a tanking group, and getting the right characters to fill in these roles isn't as simple as to pick them up in a store, the player needs to develop the characters in a specific way if they are to become a specific member of the group, as you can't just put anyone doing anything.\nThe story is interesting enough to keep you going, having it's ups and downs, and the side quests are a nice break and chance to make your characters stronger.\nThe letdowns are how the item gathering system works, as it isn't always clear where you can get the items you need to craft or upgrade your characters, but a great wiki is present at http://lastremnant.wikia.com/wiki/The_Last_Remnant_Wiki_-_The_Last_Remnant_Guide which has all the information you will need to help you with this. The main character is simple minded, childish and might not be your prefered one, but he's flexible enough to become strong in anything, so you'll find him useful.\nThis being said, the game is a great chance for people who have been wanting a deep and fun turn based RPG, specially on the PC who hasn't had anything like this in a long time.","July 12, 2013","true","26.0"," 64 of 74 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","64","74","0","0"

In reality, your success in battle will *largely* depend on what strategies you embrace, and those decisions start well before the battle screen ever initiates. Your Party is made up of all the characters you've picked up or hired, which you then organize into battle groups called Unions. During a fight, each Union is given a set of pseudo-random commands, and you select one of those options for the Union to perform (see the third-from-last screenshot on the store page).\n\nWhile at first, this system feels like a complete roll of the dice, as you get a few battles under your belt and start developing your characters, there is actually quite a bit you can do to help create conditions that give you favorable battle commands. Moreso, there are actually a number of different schemes you can play with for Union organization. For sake of example, I've had equal success with having one healer in each of my Unions, as well as having a dedicated Union that serves as an all-around party heal/buff squad, backed up with a couple long-range attackers. In fact, range also plays a pretty important role in combat; units can be intercepted en-route to their intended target, granting a damage bonus to the intervening enemy squad.\n\nGraphics are suprisingly top-notch for a game released back in '09. The spell and particle effects have aged well, and in a *shocking* twist, seem to have been ported favorably from the console version. The controls, however, didn't have as much attention paid to them. Check out warutaru's review for some crucially helpful steps in making the controls more PC-friendly!\n\nAll things considered, I have had an absolute blast playing TLR, especially for the mere ten bucks I dropped on it. I can honestly say it's one of the most pleasantly surprising games I've bought in a long, long time!","March 26, 2014","true","99.9"," 54 of 59 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","54","59","0","0"

In fact, whether you will like this game or not depends almost entirely on this system.\nThere is significant hidden depth within the mechanics of battling but you are also cruelly punished for being oblivious, as the game doesn't bother to explain much more than the basics.\n\n+ Story isn't too bad, albeit a bit plain. OST is swell which is saying something since you have to listen to the same tracks for quite a while. The music has a good variety though and they change up the battle tracks too.\n\n+ Major improvement over X360 version as well as a significant difficulty step up. The polish balances the game a lot better.\n\n\n- Enemy skill Overdrive is jaw droppingly OP. Your funeral. Their other killer skill Miracle will also make your jaw drop until you realise it wasn't half as bad as Overdrive.\n\n- Quick time events are pretty boring but then you realise that deliberately missing some of them gives you some control over the action order... Still that's a pretty haphazard way to implement such a feature. Other chance based events such as activation of remnant arts are unreliable which can be a source of annoyance.\n\n- Aside from main boss difficulty spikes, which may require you to grind for a short period of time, DLC superbosses on the other hand are near un-♥♥♥♥ing-beatable.\n\n- Insufficient tutorial for the given depth so...\n\n...If you don't want to have a bad time, consult the wikia properly as you play, which is very well written with spoiler hiding tags as required.","February 6, 2015","true","101.1"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","39","45","0","0"

I played the demo of this game now and then, trying to figure out what it's all about, how to 'level up' in it, where to go... this game is truly unique and separates itself from any strategy RPG I have ever played. Square Enix hit on something really good with this game, and that is the idea of strategic army-like combat. You get party members of all kinds, from simple soldiers to guild mercenaries with special traits/powers and the generals of Athlum, who are undoubtedly some of the most powerful characters I have. These characters are organized in to "unions" which are groups of units on the battlefield. Improving your characters is done through what actions are taken the most by them, so if you have a character using mystic invocations a lot, he/she will improve in his/her mystic invocations (though you can certainly have them learn more than that, depending on the character). There's no real "leveling system", Battle Rank is more of a bounty-like rating based on how well you've done in battles (except that it doesn't decrease), and will affect how tough your enemies will be from there on out. It's mostly about having your characters use what you want them to get better at, and then utilizing those growing skills on the battlefield appropriately, which I really like to grow them!\n\n\nHere's the catch that separates this from your typical Strategy RPG: They don't act singly. As I mentioned with the union system, they actually act as a group, so you select from 5-6(?) battle commands which vary based on many circumstances (you can see the wiki page for this game for more on that if you're curious, I highly recommend reading up on it before buying to make sure this game is something you'd want! Even try the demo!) You might get a command that says "Attack using Combat Arts" and "Attack using Mystic Arts". Selecting the first would have all units who possess a usable Combat Art use it, unless the AP cost is too high in which case they'll do a normal attack. The second would have all units who know a mystic art (not all units can be mystic users! Your main character, Rush, however, can learn all mystic arts throughout the story... I won't spoil how, that's what the wiki is for) use the one they know that doesn't go over the AP budget for that turn; Those without mystic arts would do a normal attack. Many factors influence what option shows up the most, or with the results you want, and it's these factors on the battlefield and in the character's training that make strategy all the more important. Organizing your unions appropriately, with formations that match the role you have in mind for them, and proper battlefield wit when the tide starts turning, make this game quite insane.\n\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for something more... unique in the genre of Strategy RPG. First of all, I recommend reading the wiki, watching some Youtube videos, and playing the demo before you buy. This game isn't for the faint of heart, but it also isn't overly punishing (unless you just try to zerg everything without any forethought at all to your foe's strengths and your own weaknesses) I can safely say, that this is the most unique Strategy RPG I have played to date, on Steam and off Steam.","May 13, 2015","true","36.3"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","30","34","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zirune/recommended/23310/","zirune","zirune","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zirune/","992 products in account","There aren't many JRPGs on PC, and on the surface it seems like The Last Remnant fills that gap to a T. The problems, and there are many of them, appear when you look deeper at the game; for most people, this will likely happen upon reaching a boss battle that seems (and may potentially be) impossible to win. If you can get past that, though, it can be a fun experience.\n\nThe first major problem with The Last Remnant is the battle system. Some of the decisions made by Square Enix are impossible to understand, as if battle mechanics were decided by throwing darts at a dart board.\n\nTo participate in battles, you need to create unions. These groups of up to 5 characters fight as a single entity (for the most part) in combat. When you take these unions into combat, you are given up to 5 generic commands (like an all-out attack, or healing, or inflicting ailments) which feature appropriate ability usage from each unit in the union. The issue is that you have no control over the specific abilities as well as no control over the general commands you give to your unions, leading to situations where you cannot use the command or specific ability you want for no reason at all.\n\nSecondly: QTEs. Like some other modern turn-based RPGs such as Paper Mario, The Last Remnant uses quick-time events (QTEs) to keep the player engaged. In The Last Remnant, each QTE is a single press of one of 5 buttons, with the other change-up being how fast you must press it. Compare this to a game like Paper Mario, where abilities and attacks will generally each have their own unique interaction, and it's easy to see how tedious The Last Remnants QTEs can be.\n\nCompounding upon the lack of variety and utilization of skill is the fact that QTEs in The Last Remnant can have an inordinate impact on the outcome of battles. Hitting QTEs successfully has several impacts on battle: 1) The next unit in the union has its turn come immediately after a successful QTE. 2) Hitting several QTEs in a row leads to automatic critical hits for the rest of the units in the union, provided you hit their QTEs as well. 3) Units can "reconsider" their attacks, changing what attack they are doing to what they feel is more appropriate, which is almost always a better option than their original one.\n\nWorst of all, QTEs are random. They don't always show up, and you have no impact on when they do. Then, due to how impactful QTEs are, a battle can swing simply on whether or not QTEs show up.\n\nThen there's the issue of leveling. The game gives you no information on how its non-traditional leveling works. Your units gain stats, new or upgraded abilities and your "Battle Rank" (BR) goes up every once in a while after battle. However, the game doesn't tell you that your BR is the measure of *the opponents strength*, where a higher BR makes enemies stronger in an attempt to have the game have a smooth difficulty curve. It also doesn't tell you that your BR isn't directly tied to your characters' strength, and you can use meta knowledge to have your BR stay low relative to your characters' power by fighting only the efficient battles. Unfortunately for average players (myself included), this leads to situations where you may fight most battles you come across and *hurt* yourself in the long run. And, again, due to lack of information, a player that falls into this pit won't know about this problem until they reach an impossible fight and search the internet for help, only to find out that everything they've done in the game was wrong and they may very well have to restart the entire game to fix it.\n\nAs you can see, there are many problems (and more I couldn't fit in this review) with The Last Remnant. It is a strategy game with a distinct lack of strategy in places where strategy should shine, and an RPG where how one levels is completely unclear to those who don't metagame. A dedicated player who researches can get past these problems, but the average person will become stuck and frustrated, thus I cannot recommend The Last Remnant.","November 26, 2013","false","30.3"," 147 of 232 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","147","232","0","3"

In fact, it might even be seen as comic relief, esp. with how the units ragdoll when terminated in battle.\n--The story could be executed WAY better; not to say that it's completely poor, but there are some cutscenes that are lacking in specific reactions and some relationship development that could've been included to bring about a far more emotional pull.\n--They don't really give you too much information about the connections in the plot and the background.\n--In my own personal opinion, it lacks a couple that probably would've been amazing if they made it canon.\n\nNow, onto the AMAZING:\n\n--AMAZING plot/story with AMAZING characters. They're all dorks, seriously. While relationship development and animation could've been better, they are all unique in their own right. Even the ones you can hire to be as a part of your own union have their own personalities, and some of them come with their own sidequest to get into. The plot itself could have been explained a bit better but it is DEFINITELY worthwhile with a type of ending that tends to be unique among games and even stories themselves.\n--The bosses, while incredibly difficult and ragequit-worthy, are CHALLENGING. You really need to think and strategize how you sort out your unions and how you use each character and especially what moves you make. Each boss has their own style of being beaten, and it's really awesome to get into how exactly to defeat them. Their moves are unique to them, so you have to think of ways to get around it if you die repeatedly the first twenty times. It isn't easy, and THAT'S what makes it so fun. It can be considered near IMPOSSIBLE because one of the bosses you encounter in this game, The Gates of Hell, is just lkmifowmfoIAMOIAmf rage everywhere BUT I /thoroughly/ enjoyed each battle, no matter how hard I did rage.\n--The OST is to DIE for. Every single piece is AMAZING.The battle themes? They REALLY get you pumped and it IS download worthy. And you remember that boss I just mentioned? The Gates of Hell? The music that plays during that fight is absolutely SPECTACULAR; it's one of the reasons why I didn't give up straight away.\n\nThe battle system seriously needs it own paragraphs because of how UNIQUE it is and how PERFECTLY it's set out.\n--It's kind of like chess, except more elaborate and you operate in what they term 'unions'. The formation and the leader and the units in them are customizable; the unit limit allowed in battle as well as the number of unions is small atfirst but as you go through the game, it increases. The units themselves, unfortunately, are not customizable but the main character certainly is.\n--The commands are tailored specifically to what abilities the leader has, and to an extent the rest of the union. They are also dependent on situation and the items in your inventory as well as where your unions are position on the battlefield, which makes it realistic.\n--When you launch your commands, the sequence itself that plays out gets you on the edge of your seat and it's actually REALLY mesmerizing to watch. It's not boring at all and there's the option to get involved in helping your unions attack because there's a live trigger that appears sometimes (I tend to put it on automatic but if you like getting immersed in the game then there it is!).\n--No character operates individually unless you specifically assign only one character to a single union (which is probably a straight ticket to them dying). Each character works together and it's REALLY charming, in my opinion, because you can really see their teamwork (especially when they're allowed consecutive turns due to the live triggers) buuuut I digress. What I'm trying to say is that this battle system isn't like any other, simply because the way you command them is not as individuals, but as a whole. This means that they attack as a whole, they heal as a whole, and they, well, /die/ as a whole. I'm not sure what other game exists out there that has kind of the same system (except maybe Warcraft and Dawn of War but they aren't exactly turn-based), but nothing else really comes to mind so The Last Remnant REALLY takes the cake on unique battle system.\n\nI've probably just rambled really badly in this review but I REALLY REALLY REALLY recommend this game!! I'm actually REALLY surprised that it isn't popular because I would've thought that the story and gameplay would hook people in despite the downsides. All the same, this deserves a FAR bigger fanbase so I really encourage anyone that happens across this review to try it out. Just pleeeaaasee aahhhh.

I got this game as part of a bundle and got a lot more than what I paid for. This is what happens when Final Fantasy meets Mount and Blades distant cousin. I'll explain that last sentence in better detail below. The Last Remnant uses a battlefield type feature to change the typical dynamic of an RPG.\n\nThe Last Remnant is a tale of individuals who accept remnant culture, meaning they accept the magic that comes with remnants. There is an establish figure head for remnants known as "the academy" in which they attempt to regulate the use of remnants (meaning no engineering or manipulating the pieces). An opposition exists that wants all remnants abolished. The story line (if you can sit through the masses of cut-scenes) is quite an interesting one and ties well politically into today's issues.\n\nThe player takes control of a man/dude/guy named Rush. Rush is able to freely explore the world as he wishes. More locations will open up the further Rush progresses through his quests. Usually, there is a main quest available and side quests are up to the player to find the right person in town. It was hard at first to find where I needed to go. Upon taking a closer look at the map, "!" mark where quests are available (whether it's in a town or another district). You cannot jump in free roam or any amazing things like that. Free roam is essentially meant for the player to explore or replenish/buy/sell any weapons, armor, stones, dismembered or captured beasts and (not limited to) herbs. Yes, you may capture certain monsters you fight but this is up to the game. The game also decides whether or not "rare" monster will appear. Obviously, these are worth more than your average. Upon leaving the city, the player will engage in a passive attacking free mode. You are only pulled into battle when a monster collides with you, OR when you decide to engage a monster. After a bit of time, a time rift ability appears in which you are able to slow down time and move across any dangers you do not wish to intercept. On the other hand, you may use this ability to sneak up on opponents and get the first strike. Now you have entered a battle scenario. How does this game differ than any other turn based RPG game? Well, you're on a battlefield. You literally have to plan out what your units should do or else you'll get flanked and boom, here comes the "game over" screen.\n\nA union (group of units) may consist of up to 5 units in varying formations (you can choose). You may have a few of these unions. Every character you add, adds extra HP. The issue with unions which makes them sort of mechanical is that you are not able to customize their equipment. Some may find it better this way as micro management isn't such a pain. There are those, however that like to make a connection with their characters. I'm just happy I have such a big party :). When in battle mode, you can choose to do a different variety of things (attack with magic, attack with combat, heal or tell units to use their best judgement). Each unit can be assigned one command. Each unit can also be told which target to attack. This is very vital as positioning of units will change over the course of attacks. If you send a unit to go flank another unit on the other side of the battlefield, that unit may be susceptible to a flank of their own if not properly covered by other units. You cannot physically tell units to move into a specific spot, only which targets they should attack. A neat feature to keep the player involved and on their toes (instead of waiting and watching) is quick time events. Even though it's a small game play dynamic, it still brings me back to the good old Super Mario RPG days where if you timed your attack properly, you could hit your opponent twice. This same idea is here but be careful in choosing turbo mode.\n\nYour chances of hitting the right button becomes quite difficult! Dodging doesn't have this feature but some dodges will give you a QTE to counter an opponent. I'm not a 100% if there is a dodging/blocking feature as seen in Super Mario RPG (where you press A at a certain point of the opponents attack). Beyond the fighting, there are accessories that you can give Rush that boost his HP or certain attributes. Weapons can also be changed or rotated from main arm to side arm. Alternatively, you may give your character a shield for a better defensive chance. The grinding so far into the game hasn't been extremely bad (regarding leveling up) but there are times where you won't be able to beat a boss until you get your level up to a certain point. Some may find this annoying.\n\nThe visuals are actually really well done. When in battle screen and your soldiers and enemies are close together, they will jockey for position and lunge at each other. These are not official attacks but definitely add definitive beauty to the game. I hate seeing steady background when two arch enemies are staring at each other and don't do anything. I'm glad someone paid attention to this. Sounds are suitable to what the games needs are. There is nothing over the top but I think they could have been a bit more creative with the noise. Music on the other hand is quite soothing when not in battle.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game. Some may find the turn base thing annoying (which I completely agree as I hate turn based games) but I found this game appealing enough to keep at it - and I'm glad I did. The battlefield strategies alongside the QTEs and fluidity of battle cinematics should be enough to make you forgot you're playing a turn based game.\n\n\nRATING : 7.65/10\n\n\n\nGameplay	B	Story / Campaign	B	Visuals / User Interface	B	Sounds / Music	B	Replay-ability	C+	Overall 	B-\n\nScreenShots\n\n\nInitiating a battle\n\nThere are more than just humans in this game\n\nIf you are a big fan of cut scenes you'll adore this game.

During the main story you'll probably never run into those, but very difficult sidequests and strong rare monsters appear way sooner than they should, making you wonder why the devs bothered including the battle rank system in the first place.\n\nIt doesn't help that the game hides to much info, such as how the class system works, character skill levels, class requirements, quest objectives, material sources, etc. Making it almost mandatory to play this game with the last remnant wikia open on the side.\n\nThen come matters of personal preference. Being a JRPG, you pretty much know to expect flashy (and somewhat silly) character designs, oversized weapons, steriotypical characters (although a few are quite well fleshed out).\n\nThe story itself could be interesting, but it has an incredibly odd pacing, sending you back and forth between cities (your travel on the world map is instant though), walking randomly into city areas in order to trigger a scene, talking with a generic NPC nobody ever mentioned...\n\nThere are also some heavy sins such as the narration interlude at the end of part 1, interrupting a moment of tension as if nothing of importance happened thereafter. Cliches abound as well with characters fainting or dying before revealling crucial information, characters looking wide-eyed at someone outside the shot and then the scene cutting off somewhere else, antagonists leaving heroes alive just because, and the list goes on and on...\n\nTo summarize, The Last Remnant is far too quirky, unbalanced and badly written for me to recommend it, yet, it managed to make me obsess over it with a large number of sidequests and room for powergaming. If, despite such warnings you still want to play this game (seeing as it's rather cheap), do so with the last remnant wikia on the side, and study well how to keep your Battle Rank low, how to better progress characters through classes, which characters are useless, which are good, sidequests availability, weapon upgrade paths, crafting material sources, etc.","June 4, 2015","false","106.2"," 47 of 71 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","47","71","3","0"

I really like the graphics of the various spells you cast, the combat is really fun to watch, and sometimes the game can get really, really hard (i.e. DLC bosses omg). But hey, I finished it at 100%, and I'm not some hardcore gamer. There's SO MUCH to learn about that when you realize how in-depth and complex the game mechanics are, it can get overwhelming and you might end up quitting.\n\nThe wiki for it has a plethora of information, so you can't really "get lost". But there's so much to do that a 100% completion, played casually and just exploring without really being sure what to do... That's gonna take over 150 hours, most likely.\n\nNEW GAME +. oh yes, starting the game with large amounts of cash, and a few other things that I won't spoil.\nThe units and leaders: So. many. possibilities. You dislike a guy? Bench him forever. Want to make a party of only chicks? Go for it. Don't like the main toon? Don't play him. (But he can kinda do everything so worth using).\n\nAh, also. Beautiful story, I really enjoyed the graphics (I mean I played it 7-8 years ago) and the universe you play in is quite large, there's a ton of quests to do.\n\n\n\nCons? Sure there's a few.\nKinda flawed, a little redundant sometimes, the main character is not the brightest guy..\nMagic isn't as strong as you'd want it to be, sigh. S\nome bosses are super annoying and are tough to kill regardless of what you try.\nThe items for your companions, well you can't really choose what they use. Some have unique items, and to properly "equip" them, you kinda have to learn how leveling works... which is very complex. Not complicated, complex.\n\n\nOverall: for it's genre, a turn-based JRPG, I'm honestly giving it at 9/10. I don't see what could possibly make it have a bad score. The bad reviews are mainly because of people not taking the time to understand the in-depth mechanics.\nIT. IS. COMPLEX. But really, really, really fun.\n\n\nTLDR: Very complex game. Unique leveling/combat mechanics. Endless customization. There isn't a lot of information in-game about how everything works (you need the wiki, srsly). But if you like RPGs, and turn-based rpgs, (enchanted arms, lost odyssey) you're gonna love this. It's freaking 13 bucks (to me at least) and has all the DLCs. Until Lost Odyssey gets to PC, I'll be playing this often.\n","May 4","true","327.6"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","20","25","2","3"

The Last Remnant is a JRPG that seems similar to Final Fantasy although I never actually played it. There is a touch of grinding inside this game, but I wouldn't say it was boring or time wasting, more of entertaining. I have really low standards for most games so I don't think I have a well made opinion on games. However, the graphics, in my opinion, are eye catching, there are some unique looking characters once in a while which I really liked. The sounds and soundtracks are well made and catchy. Only thing I dislike is how the main character is the typical implusive idiot, that rushes in without thinking, it gets boring when most games today has that type of build for the protaganist. Anyways, I found this game pretty good and I wouldn't mind paying full price for a game like this eventhough I bought it during the sale.

The visuals are what you would expect from a modern day game and the cinematics remind you of playing a Final Fantasy game (Square Enix still has it).  The last Remant received below average reiews on the Xbox 360 but don't let that dissuade you from giving this one a try on the PC.  Most of the bugs/problems were fixed outside of some noticeable texture pop-in.  You can pause anytime in the game including the CG scenes!  You can even skip the CG scenes if you doing a 2nd play through.  There is an autosave that will save progress after each battle ensuring that you will never have to replay an hour of gaming session because you took a gamble on defeating an enemy before they took your heath down just to die first.  These are the features that I have been waiting for ever since I started playing RPGs.\n\nA few things to note, this game requires alot of forumn reading.  Not as much for the story progression as it is fairly linear but more to understand the mechanics of the battle/formation system.  Square Enix took a new direction in the battle system allowing for a very diverse and strategic gameplay but the in game tutorials will leave you scratching your head as to what is happening during the battles.  This has to be the biggest issue that I have with the game.  After reading the FAQs and forumns I found that many others had the same questions that I ran into and most where answered in depth by users in the Steam community.\n\nIn summary, if you don't mind doing a little reading to nail down the game mechanics and you enjoy turn based battle systems I would definetely recommend the Last Remnant.  The price even when not on sale is well worth the content and enjoyment that you will get out of it.  This is a AAA title from Square Enix with an Indie price tag.  Go buy it right now if you are a fan of Fantasy RPGs!","October 29, 2013","true","24.7"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tantaluspl/recommended/23310/","tantaluspl","Tantalus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tantaluspl/","246 products in account","TL;DR - Its the most mediocre game I ever played. Not really worth a negative review, but I have only two options to choose from. Designed for xbox360 controller, so I recommend using it. If for some reason you decide to play this game, please use the game wiki extensively (if you don't want to lose 60% of sidequests), try not to increase your Battle Rank to fast and skip all dialogue if possible - the plot is horrible. Game offers about 80-120h of playtime.\n\nPRO's:\n+ Amazing graphics -  Stunning background environment, very detailed character and item design. Every weapon in this game looks like the ultimate weapon in some other RPG.\n+ Unique battle mode - You control up to 5 groups of heroes that you can recruit from special guild or meet during your journey. Each group of heroes permorm a single action, moving on a battle field. Groups of characters and enemies can intercept one-another while they attack or gang up on one group to finish it off quicker. Its a very clever idea for a turn-based combat system.\n+ Lots of sidequests - There are many different things to do, lots of guild missions, sidequests and hidden bossfights. You can take a break from main plot and gather some plants for potions or minerals for weapons in a spare time.\n+ Lots of characters - You meet many characters, most of them with their unique backstory and special quests. You can use a lot of them at the same time (up to 20) and you got a big group of people to choose from.\n+ Decent music - Nice, hard beat during fighs and chilled tunes in dungeons, works great with those pretty backgrounds.\n\nCON's\n- Almost unplayable without a guide - there is a nice The Last Remnant wiki out there and if you want to play this game, you better add it to your bookmarks. The game offers no explanation of some of its vital mechanics (like party formations or Battle Rank) and you might become confused easily (especially because some of the mechanics doesn't work as intended or don't work at all). Whats worse is that all sidequests have cut-off points in the main plot - you can do them only if you stop your main plot progress before unspecified point and look for them. You can't leave a quest you find to finish it off, because there might be nothing to get back to.\n- Main plot is awful - Rush is the blandest character in jRPG since Tidus and Sora, a cartboard-cutout without a single unique trait. His sister is a run-of-the-mill damsel in distress and all other primary characters have a personality of a typical Micheal Bay movie protagonist. The main plot is terrible, offers little to no payoff, its clear that it was cut and rewritten numerous times during the game development. If you are in it for the story, you gonna be disappointed.\n- Team orders are randomized at each turn - you can't choose freely what to do with each character or even a group of characters. In each turn you pick one of the several semi-randomized orders you can give at this time. You may find that your team of healers won't have a healing order in some turn or you won't be able to use magic on specified stack of monsters.\n- You can't equip items on characters other than Rush - weapons, armors, accessories - you can change them freely on Rush, but no other character. If you got a powerful weapon in your inventory, some characters may ask you if they could equip it (they probably won't though). They will however ask you to give them some raw materials for upgrading their own weapons and gear, as well as your opinion on what they should focus on - magic or physical attacks. It barely does anything so you have very little say in what you characters are using in battle.\n- Havok engine - enjoy your wacky ragdolls :)\n\nSUMMARY\nIts worse than you might hope, but better than you fear. Its really the most mediocre thing I've played. As a fan of SaGa series (its from the same devs) I enjoyed some of its mechanics, battles are unique, graphics are amazing and I had fun playing it from time to time. However, its obvious the game was developed in a hurry - it got so much wasted potential that its really heartbreaking.","December 21, 2013","false","102.1"," 75 of 128 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","75","128","0","4"

It starts very conservative and slowly, but once it get rolling it is extremly awesome.\nCool characters - although the main character is a  little bit annoying from time to time - , well-written story and a really complex fighting system, in which the battles are really intense. It look a bit like final fantasy, but it doesn't play that way. It has a unique moral system, which increases or decreases the damage of your unions, depending on how you position them, and how you perform actions.  You can totally customize your union, and there is a huge amount of differenct characters, mercenarys, soldiers and questcharacters to choose from.\nThere a a lot of boss monsters, whom are very different from each other, and are most of the time really hard to actually beat.\nThe game looks absolutly stunning. The performance is extremly smooth, and i have yet to find a place, where i have lags or where the games stutters.\nIt is pretty unique and an experiment which you either love or hate.\nBe prepared, the game is not easy, and if you don't plan ahead in a fight, you will find yourself loading the last save file.\nHowever i would definitly recommend playing this game with a Xbox Controller. Although the keyboard layout is pretty good, you have to first activate the tooltips to show the keyboard-commands instead of the gamepad commands.\nSome reviews have claimed, that you cannot skip cutscenes, which is rather bullocks. Pause the game, and then there is an option to skip them (on the Xbox-Controller Start+Back).\n\nAll-in all in my honest opinion, i think this game is absolutly brilliant. It has the classic J-RPG feel, with a very complex combat system, an incredibly well written story ( i am not even half through and it has already blown me away), and stunning graphics. And although there are some annoyances with the keyboard commands, i would definitly recommend this game to everyone who loves J-RPGs or who always wanted to play one.

Essentially it's a squad based semi-tactical JRPG. Why semi? Because unfortunately it heavily relies on RNG component rather than real tactics. You'll command a mini-army of 18 characters (units) divided by 4-5 squads, the problem is that you can only give them a set of commands (like, "attack with all you've got", or "help the others") and which skills/spells to use they'll decide on their own, for example if you want to bombard a certain enemy with a certain spell than you'll have to rely on luck, your units may decide to use them, use something else or even just simply attack with their weapons. There are few workarounds (essentially just having 3-5 people in a squad with a desired spell will boost chances of casting it or switching targets to get another set of commands) but sometimes it could lead to a very unfortunate results in your battles. I think it's the main reason why this game was not very well received.\n\nDespite all that it's still a very fun game to play, there are a lot of everything in this game: characters, weapons, skills, equipment etc. Believe me - quantity of everything is just enormous.

Music, voice acting and sound effects are quite good too, they fit game play but also get repetitive (boring?) after a decent amount of hours spent in combat.\n\n✘ Why is it flawed?\n\nBecause... You already know, don't you? This cannot be the first review you've read about this game.\nAnyhow, combat/inventory systems are flawed, it's not just a tough game.\n\nFighting can be a PITA because the game offers you only a limited set of choices: what I found terrible is that most of the time I had to battle a Boss I couldn't heal, because there was no option to do that.. I could only fight. And you can believe me that when a Boss strikes, it can take away half of your HP and that's not all... There are attacks and counter-attacks, so you might receive additional damage in one turn and if you're not given an option to heal as soon as you need it, it's game over - no workarounds.\nBasically you'll have to grind in order to fight Bosses and I understand that's part of the game, levelling up while doing side quests and so forth, but it can be annoying too.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=660411472\n\nInventory is half broken too because you can't manage your party's. Say you have some objects sitting in your inventory - a potion, a weapon or anything else -  you can't trade it to another companion because it's not possible at all. They can only request you things after you have harvested or crafted them: I read about a hack which lets you edit/use inventories the way they are supposed to, but I personally didn't want to take that route.\n\nMost of my friends warned me about these issues I've been talking of, but I didn't want to listen before actually trying myself.. You know how it went, I have to agree with them.\n\nI won this game in a giveaway, so I am not regretting buying it but I can't recommend it anyway (especially if you're not a true fan of the genre) even if my actual feelings about The Last Remnant are mostly positive.","April 7","false","21.0"," 24 of 38 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","24","38","0","3"

There is much to get acquianted with but long-time rpg players will quickly get the hang of it. However, personally I feel that any of the game's good ideas have already been done far better in the past.\n\nAfter playing for a fairly long time, around 50~ hours and sort of enjoying most of it, the game's faults finally caught up with me and the battles, farming for stuff in caves and the general gring of it all became too much. The battles seem huge and action packed at first but when you get familiar with it, it's just quick jump cuts to out of context scenes of one character striking another, looking at floating numbers and on to the next jump cut. Understanding that the fighting area of the whole world is really just the same huge flat space with no sense of distance or scale ultimately put me off and removed the little fun I had in the action of this game.\n\nThe characters are akin to the Final Fantasy tactics games' lineup of mostly silent non-story characters who are just a part of your squadron and are ultimately replacable. In those games you could micro manage and customize them very specifically to your needs and sometimes new characters would be available to you for story reasons, however, again in The Last Remnant cutstomizability is turned down to telling each squadmate what to focus on, physical or magical attacks.\n\nThe cities have some uniqe appeal to them with special scenery here and there, but as the game moved along it seemed as though the time spent on design diminished to the point where I couldn't tell the difference between the last 3 cities I was in. After playing through the first 5 or so dungeons/field levels you also start to see repeated patterns and quite frankly lazy and boring design choices, for example the floor is always completely flat with no elevation.\n\nThere are a few good things with the game though, to be fair. The aggro and chaining system was fun and worked fairly well, deciding how many enemies at a time you could fight and try to get them to chase you around. The graphics were okay, the fighting effects were rewarding to watch the first 1000 times or so, and the world seemed open and interesting on first glance.\n\nUltimately the game's faults outweighed its strengths and it became a boring, repetitive waste of time for me. There are already tons of good JRPGs just like this out there, and more to the point, I'd say play any one of those over this.","March 29, 2014","false","57.0"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","0"

If you go in medium-depth, you're going to realize you missed out on a lot and that it takes forever to find anything without a guide- and even then, it will be a taxing journey through page after page of wiki and entering/exiting areas to fight rare monsters you're not even sure really exist.  If you go in deep you're just going to be frustrated to realize that at the end of the day the game is a roulette that you must subtly influence in truly inane ways and can screw you no matter how clever, thorough or prepared you are when it counts.\n\nAt any level you'll find something to love, but so many things that mar it so bad that you can't help but realise they wasted it completely.

Towns and surrounding areas are all but-nonexistant because of the way they designed the maps to be enclosed and small. We are given a protagonist who is an utter idiot, and we are supposed to believe all these hyper-competent leaders want to follow this stupid kid who does nothing but mess up and make stupid on-the-fly decisions? The antagonist had potential. in the first disc whenever he shows up he is a pure badass, but then he keeps showing up randomly and leaves randomly. They were stretching it, it seems they just wanted him to do something badass and then disappear again, even though him being at that place and his subsequent actions make no sense. The voice acting is far below par, they have decent VAs but it seems the direction they were given was poor.\n\nThe worst of it is the character animations during conversations and cutscenes. I read they had motion capture work done, and it seems ALL of it went into the combat animations which were amazing, but cutscene and conversation animations are so bad it is jarring, and it took me right out of what was happening. This is saying something, I have a high tolerance for mediocre character animation, this game crossed a line somewhere.\n\nNow the combat... Oh the combat, how you had the potential to be a JRPG game changer. "Lets take something tactical and add randomness and take away most of the player control, that would be brilliant!" No SquareEnix, no, stop it, stop... it... stop it. Side tangent; has noone in this world heard of ranged weapons? Are bows and crossbows too complex of an idea, do they have to cast most of their magic in melee range? The combat system of unions and leaders was an amazing idea, but once you get to the actual combat, it becomes garbage. I have 60+ AP to spend, why are all the actions available under 16? The best you can do is remove options you dont want showing up to increase the chance of getting something good, which doesn't work enough to not be very frustrating.\n\nAll of your unions will want to bunch up when fighting enemies, only way to stop this is to make them stay back. But as I said, there is a distinct lack of ranged options. Most of the magic in this game does NOT have a ranged option, not even healing. The magic that DOES have a ranged option will greatly limit what that union can do that turn, and the best magic is ALL melee range. Worst of all, you can not then control your union positioning, you can spread out these tightly packed unions all attacking the same thing, which leaves rare monsters and bosses with wide area AoE attacks to really really really suck.\n\nSo lets talk about what I did actually like about the game, the things that kept me interested enough to keep playing so long -- All the side things in the game. Hunting down rare monsters, getting my party members stronger, finding new unique leaders, toying with formations and union composition (especially for the really difficult opponents.)\n\nThe main quest line might suck, but all the side things to do in this game are what provide content worth experiencing. I absolutely love the SaGa system of character progression, no more grinding out levels to overpower your opponent, you have to be smarter about how you approach bosses. This can be exploited of course, no leveling system is perfect, but for your first play through, you are unlikely to manipulate the system. There is another downside - where SaGa frontier games allow you to build a suitable party early, the unique leaders in Last Remnant are spread out. So, leaders you get early will be a lot stronger than ones you get later, they did not scale recruits to your Battle Rank (your level as it were) they merely gave them starting stats which they think is sufficient for that point in the game.\n\nHunting down rare monsters and crafting materials... at points frustrating, very frustrating, but that just makes the pay off of getting them all the sweeter. Could have been handled better, sometimes the RNG really kicks you in the mouth.\n\nI can not honestly recommend this game, what it does well, others do it better so you are better off with those. I was strangely compelled to keep playing to the end, but too much was not enjoyable. I will not be coming back to this game at a later time like the vast majority of my other games, I will not feel like playing this game again, it will collect dust in my steam library. Best I can say is that I really got my money's worth, as I bought it during a steam sale.","June 27, 2014","false","225.8"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Greytrip/recommended/23310/","Greytrip","The Dude","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Greytrip/","313 products in account","This is a Square made Final Fantasy style game that I never even heard about until I saw it on Steam.  Instead of 1-5 party members like most JRPG's, you get to have around 25 in a fight at a time.  Its broken into 5 man teams.  So each team gets a turn in combat each round.\n\nI'm on the fence about the game.  The quality is there because its a typical Final Fantasy world, which I love, but it seems that at a certain point the battles become a flip of a coin to win.  When one of your squads has a turn it has several options it can perform depending on how the party is set up.  Though these options are not stagnant options.  Out of the say 8 things possible that the squad can do only 4 options will randomly be chosen each turn.  This means that if your healer squad doesn't get the healing option for multiple turns it can mean game over.  You can mitigate this by removing options that a team can perform so that they don't clog up the limited action bar.  While that helps, you still often have to rely on luck and a coin flip to get an important action to occur at the right time.  This is the part that I can't get over.  There is little precision to the battles.  In normal fights the chaos can be really fun, but when a boss fight comes it can lead to a large helping of frustration.\n\nIt's fun and playable.  If 5 were my recommend mark, it sits at 4.  Very close but with a heavy heart I cannot recommend it.","March 5, 2014","false","50.7"," 28 of 48 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","28","48","0","6"

At first, seems a sub-Final Fantasy title (and, concerning story, characters and the world, it certainly is), but the stellar combat makes it something special. Also, it's a +100 hours game, even if you don't do all the quests and guild tasks. I played it for 103 hours and got to level 92, without grinding or being too much of a completist.\n\nIt took me almost 10 hours to get the hang of combat, but after I understood its system, the game became really exciting. At first seemed like the characters were playing by themselves, but you start to realize how important strategy is. The most important thing is keeping a high morale, by flanking and intercepting the enemy and not letting him do the same to you. And, as the characters learn new "arts", you have more options and the battles get way more interesting _ specially when you "link" several enemies and becomes outnumbered. You can also enable QTEs during combat, to perform critical hits and to parry or counterattack _ it takes a while to get them right and it will make you curse at the screen, but it's great fun.\n\nThere were some boss fights that appeared to be impossible, but became a breeze after I changed strategy. This is a game that's not hard at all, but fair: play it well and you'll have a good time. Besides that, there's a lot of customization, from items to military formations.\n\nIt's a pity the developers didn't add achievements and trading cards.

The game has a pretty interesting story enough to grab your attention every cinematic, and interesting battle system. However, the game is ruined by the lack of customization. They throw you into a world with no help at all without explaining anything about the game such as battlerank, unit battlerank, and how the character's stats are distributed. It becomes a headache trying to google everything you need to know and trying to understand how the system works. And, time to time, you will run into situations where you will need to google informations about the quest, weapon upgrade informations, that "should" have been in the game.","June 26, 2014","false","17.2"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

Below is a comprehensive list of Pros and Cons, as well as some Middling views after beating the game.\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Story\nThe story is fairly simple, as is the main character, Rush. He's introduced running into a battlefield while two armies fight - anybody that dumb is surely the main protagonist I want to root for. But, all kidding aside, the story has the basic elements to make it interesting enough to grab ahold of your attention.\n\n+ Graphics\nThe scenery is absolutely beautiful, and you can tell a lot of detail went into the water/background effects, the way that every city or town has their own unique architecture, and every cave or open area feels both wide open and yet closed off simultaneously, as if something is just over the horizon.\n\n+ Music\nWhile the battle music does fluctuate randomly (more on that below) the tracks themselves are very good at what they do. The sad music is appropriately tear-jerking, the Uh-Oh music is ready to make you panic a little, and the fight music makes you want to swing a claymore through somebody's torso at times.\n\n+ Gameplay\nA much-contested portion of this game, based on numerous Critic- and Reader Reviews online, is that the battle system is very interesting. I have to agree - "Interesting" being the operative word here. Some battles are over before they begin, for good or ill, and that makes some fights tedious but mostly it's fair enough to not have to re-re-fight something for the umpteenth time because that one character is too slow.\n\nMIDDLINGS:\n\n~ Travel\nYou start off the game by running through a cavern. And... that's the entirety of the game. At least, so it seems for the first hour or so. You run here, run there, watch a cutscene, run somewhere else, more cutscenes, finally explore a cave or castle and... more running. Thankfully, once you've discovered a city/cave/dungeon/area, you can just warp to the main entrance directly from the main map, so it's not a huge slog all the time.\n\n~ Areas\nThe scenery is beautiful, but it's so empty. Every open field is huge - really, really big - and you feel so small. Great, right? Well... no, not really. You can sit and stare at the walls for so long before you want to get to where the story or the fighting is going on, but first you need to run down huge expanses of empty field or desert to get there.\n\n~ Fighting\nIf the battle system is great, that means that something has to be wrong with the fights - they're interesting enough initially with a small number of people and a semi-large group of enemies (2-4), but that quickly becomes tedious. So they increase the amount of "unions" (groups) available, making the micro-managing element reappear in a shiny new suit. But it's still the Final Fantasy XIII method of winning most of the fights: Mash Enter/Space/X/A to win.\n\n~ Music\nThe cities and towns share music. The dungeons share music. The only places I know of that have their own musical scores are the optional places to go visit, and even then the music is pretty bland after three hours of it. Battle music especially is annoying, seeing as how it jumps based on how the fight is going. Going badly? Bad music; good fight, good music. Bosses are notorious for this at times, with notable exception being the final boss.\n\n~ Characters\nLoads. Almost 300 named characters, each with somewhat distinct characteristics. That "mitra" (human) is a healer, this one's a sword-and-board fighter, and that one uses explosives. Varied and interesting enough for the Generals - that is, the Unique characters you can assign/recruit - to make it so you know who's who right off the bat.\n\n~ Voices\nThe in-battle and after-battle dialogue is especially tedious after the 20+ hour mark. You really start to hate the way somebody says something about "needing the other one, the other one!" every time they level up. To be fair, hearing Pagus (a main character) give you a backhanded comment on how that spell was "effective" is a nice touch.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Grinding\nThis game is tiring, and that's because about 85% of the game is running around killing the same enemies hundreds of times for that one item you need to make the one piece of gear that's a slight upgrade to the piece you're already wearing. Not to mention Mr. Diggs (albeit the best character in the game) is necessary to acquire the ores/metals you need to upgrade or create most of the gear you want, so that's also a factor.\n\n- Diggs\nThe aforementioned Mr. Diggs is a unique aspect to the mining process - a weird rabbit-like creature with huge pink round eyes that dances when it gains a level - but it only adds to the grinding nature of the game. You first acquire him with 5 digs available - he can mine grass or rocks 5 times before you need to exit to the world map and come back in. That, in of itself, isn't so bad; the bad part is that the digsites, and what you acquire from them, are randomized every time you load up the map.\n\n- Crafting\nNo game from Squeenix these days seems to be complete without some kind of Creation gimmick, and TLR is no exception. The gear you make is better than what you buy, and what you buy is the base for what you make. So you've done your 3+hours of Digging and killing monsters and finally have enough materials to upgrade your weapon for a... +3 attack damage output. That's just ludicrous, and not in a fun way, either.\n\n- Parties\nYou start out with a small party of about 3-5 people in it, reasonable enough when learning the game, but you don't actually increase the size of that initial party until a good two hours into the game. Seeing as how you go up against bosses and groups of enemies (6-7 groups at most, with about 3-4 enemies in each group) with your small team, it almost seems unfair the lengths you need to go to survive encounters.\n\nSo you've crafted that unique 2-handed sword for your beefy tough guy? Too bad, you can't equip it on him manually. Everything is done automatically for you, when the game decides it wants to let them have the item. And even then, without memorizing who's who, you may accidentally give that new weapon to your healer and not your damage dealer.\n\nIn combat, your main group could be near death and the others are at top health. There is no "heal me" or "heal them" option available unless the game decides it wants to give one to you. The micro-managing aspects that people said have disappeared from this game are what make it so annoying at the same time. There are times when yes, I really do want to use certain attacks by a certain character on a certain enemy, because I know it'll work really well - but the game decides that said character is going to try and level their fighting ability and not that healing spell I'm trying to increase.\n\n- Combat\nThe game already takes forever in terms of grinding, and thankfully, the PC port has given us the ability to speed up the fights. It is wonderful - and yet, the sheer volume of fighting negates that entire wonderful feeling. You're going to end up seeing the same monsters again, and again, and again, for nearly the entire game. There is only one part of the main quest where Giants come into play, and only in that one section. The rest of the time, it's generic enemy models.\n\n- Enemies (field)\nAs stated above, the types of enemies shown on the field are very few in distinction. What is very aggravating are their hit-boxes; the area in which they can start a fight against you. It isn't well defined or even shown, and a gentle tap from a flying enemy above you where you can't see it starts a fight where they get a free turn.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: If the game's on sale, and you like tactical RPGs, go for it. Otherwise, just play Final Fantasy.\n(Or Blue Dragon for the 360, it's like this but better.)","March 4","false","28.7"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","14","23","0","2"

THE LAST REMNANT !!!\n\nComming From the Xbox 360 Version, this game has undone some extreame polish for PC since it's release. i've endured the major issues with the console version of this game from start to finish, and have recently moved to the PC version because of it's much needed updates.\n\nThis is an outstanding game. Using the best of SAGA character development, an innovative combat engine modeled off of squad tactics, but with each character being individualy accounted for (if they are the one attacked, thier chance to dodge is what matters, but formations and current tactics effect who is at risk) an intruiging and well told plot (note, "side" quest are essential to experience the majority of it), outstanding graphics (as played on a PC), and most of all, constantly fun.\n\nThere is something of a steep curve to get good at combat, and if you do not wrap your mind around it, it may seem random, but it isn't very random at all, and a keen understanding of pre fighting tactical choices (setup) and in combat tactical choices is essential to beat any of the major monsters from about the first 1/5 of the game on. fortunately there are numerious (really unlimited) fights with lesser monsters, and so equally limited (or not) chances to experament.\n\nWorth playing by all rpg fans, this manages to be unique and present some experamental ideas with polish and mechanical balance that makes it seem like a much more mature project. on a side note, many reviewers were turned off by the combat engine. I suspect this came from not indulging enough in the gameplay, it is not a standard console rpg, mechanically, and one should not expect to succeed without some new ways of thinking. That said, it is something that the rpg (jrpg especially) market really needs. LR's combat engine is also important as a story telling device, because it is not the story of a few super heroes, but rather of a world war, and the player controls an army. The combat engine allows the player to quickly, elligantly, with simple menu choices and just a few buttons, control a small army of 36 unit (6-10 squads if mem serves), and fight even larger ones, as well as fascilitates massive bosses attacked by your army. For instance, your army fighting a dragon and its horde of followers, in one large battle.\n\nSo far, no J-styled rpg has greatly surpased the techniques used in the earliest FF games, a big fight as described above would just be your 1 squad fighting a series of battles without a break, followed finally by the big bad, and *maybe* letting you fight the big bad with more than one squad. Games which have used engines to deliver more, have been too convoluted for simple menu based play. LR manages to be simple to control, fun to think about (as a tactical puzzle, which is the big draw of JRPG combat) and delivers a constantly rewarding and enthralling experience.\n\nIn spite of a few small flaws, LR remains a well designed and built game, consnstantly fun and hcallenging, and truly innovative and worth the time of any player looking for a brilliant new idea\n\n-XeroSyphon","December 28, 2013","true","2.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Don't expect photorealism however. Some spells and abilities have great visuals though and same goes for invocations.\nThe combat system and the way strategy is designed make for some nice gameplay.\nUnique characters, some of which with backstory to discover in side quests.\nThe main quest is long enough without being necesseraly tedious.\nUnique cities, very varied to visit.\n\nCon:\nCharacter levelling is difficult to grasp since it's dependant entirely on the arts and abilities used in game, which are linked to the chosen weapon, with no real ingame help how to tailor and fine tune it. Player effect on character stats is indirect through equipment solely.\nIt's a JRPG so it's somewhat on railroads and definitely not an open world like Fallout or Skyrim. A lot more freedom of movement and action in this one than in many other JRPG but it's restrained at times.\nIf you follow the story, the ending is really expected. So the main story could definitely be improved.\n\nI've overall spent a nice time roaming the various, very unique cities, all of them with a specific style and going through sidequests, not of a few of which are very humorous. The way combat is done may rebuke some, but it's got its advantages although it can be quite frustrating at times. I prefer to have more control on my characters in general, but that was far from an obstacle. Crafting offers some variety though looking for specific components can take some time. Recruiting unique squad leaders and unique/rare bosses make free exploration rewarding.\nIt's not the game of the century but definitely worth the investment to have a relaxed time in a JRPG by Square Enix.

Instead of levels, units gain stats growth via battles and the harder the fight, the greater the stats increase will be.\n\nPlayed the 360 version of the game but the Pc version is superior to the prior with the additions of leader limit no longer present, locking art categories of leaders and better performance overall.

If you aren't use to tactical positioning, you will end up crushed in a few places.  If you aren't use to using statuses (negative and positive) you will get stuck.

Well I got anything but that last part.\n\nThe maing gripe I have with the game is the difficult combat system paired with the penalizing Battle Rank (BR) system. The combat is nice once you get the hang of it, though I find it very confusing that the only way to learn the combat normally; trying to get into as many fights as you can, is penalized heavily by the BR system.\n\nThe BR system is not your level, but it's a rank that goes up according to the amount of fights you've had, the higher it gets the more difficult the enemies get. Not so bad right? Well if you manage to somehow get your BR high before a section of the game played in Nest of Eagles you may very well get stuck here, this only being the first half of the game leads you to redo the entire game up to that point, mostlikely following a guide telling you to keep your BR low. (Not what happened in my case, but I was close to doing this)\n\nNot only does the BR system make the fights harder it also makes powering up the later characters you get in part 2 harder to make useful. Now this happened to me. The workaround being farming a unique monster called Bai Ze or in this releases case you could also opt to farm insects at the cost of two unique units. This allows you to farm your characters up to an acceptable stat range or to help you in cheesing the game.\n\nThe combat is done in unions; groups of characters in formations, different formations give different stat bonuses. The unions then have "random" actions that they can do. Herein lies the problem, the actions I want to do are the actions that, most of the time, are not readily available while I feel this takes away from the strategic point of view, it enforces defensive play and working with what you have; it does however make the difficulty of the strategy feel articficial since instead of giving a difinitive way to take on a fight, you have to hope you get those actions to pop-up.\n\nThe problem comes from the combat and penalizing BR system, you try to learn the game and do all the sidequests once they're all available, raising your BR to a level the game didn't expect you to have and making the rest of the fights too difficult to progress. The sidequests may be optional but some of them become too much to handle, the solutions being to farm a unique monster, to spam hard to trigger arcana spells, and to change your formation into one that simply bumrushes the boss and hope that they die before you get killed. If you still think the game is a fair challenge after this go ahead and buy it, I know it's old but for a game to be unforgiving to a point where you cannot progress the story is just wrong.","July 8, 2015","false","75.5"," 49 of 91 people (54%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","54","49","91","6","0"

Last Remnant brings some interesting ideas on the table, but also have some very serious flaw that drags him down. The unions battle system doesn\'t really deliver the strategic feeling it should; too much RNG screwing up battles, sometime in your favour, sometime not.  You can\'t command action freely for every member; RNG will decide if you get a good command or not. You can\'t decide when and if the QTE for critical strikes will trigger; RNG will decide if you get a chance for a damage increase or not. Same thing for the special attacks that certain characters can use. Heck, you can\'t even freely change any of your party members equipment! There is simply no excuse for this, it\'s just bad design. For the majority of the game, the outcome of every battle that is not faceroll easy will be decided solely on rng dodges, rng parries, rng crits, rng special commands, and so on. As a result, you will not find any form of satisfaction within the gameplay, not even when you win.\n\nAs for the rest:\n\nVideo: visuals are nice considering the release date, but level design sucks, with the same halls and corridors that repeat themself over and over. Every location has it\'s flair of course, but just one, with almost zero variations within it. Animations works fine within battle and in most of the cutscenes, outside of them tend to be kinda crappy and unrealistic. The game also presents some technical problems: costant screen tearing (you can turn the vsync on editing the .ini file, but it will not work regardless) and texture-popping are the most noticeable. There are some partial fixes around the web, though.\n\nAudio: OST is good but without any kind of personality. Also, many locations have shared music.\n\nNarrative: the story is nothing special - but good enough to grab your attention \'till the endgame, even if some part of it seemed like rushed, some almost absurdly so. Characters are generally well designed, but the protagonist can be very, very annoying at times.\n________________\n\n\nIf you are searching for a jrpg with an unique feeling, and you are capable of keeping your cool even after dying again, and again, and again just because of bad luck, then maybe you can consider to buy this game. The price is low afterall, especially on sale, and the title can keep you busy for a lot of hours. If not, then it\'s probably better to spend your money on something else.\n","June 1","false","66.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

When I looked at it on Steam I wasn't really sure about buying it... Well, I did and now I must say that you MUST buy it!!!\n\nThe Last Remnant is an awesome Strategy / RPG game!\n\nThe combat system feels good, making it easy, but also very challenging at some points. It focus a lot on group combat, while you can't choose each character's action, you can order the group to do the same thing in a strategic way. You can split your party members into units that can have up to 5 members, when you choose an action, the whole unit will perform that same action. The game sometimes changes the options you have in battle, for example, if you're in a story related battle, it sometimes changes your combat options, making you trigger an event. The strategy you use is totally up to you to decide, the game gives you a lot of customizable options, you can change an unit's formation, change it's members, and use specific commands in battle, like ordering an unit to heal other unit.\n\nThe graphics are also very good, you know, for a 2009 game.. And since it's a Square Enix game, you can expect a lot of amazing cutscenes and a very well written fantasy story.\n\nThere's also a few more features included, like crafting and hiring soldiers to your party.\n\nThe game only lacks in some things, like the character's level, since there's no level thingy, sometimes when you complete a battle, your characters can get stronger, gaining HP, AP, Attack, and even their weapons can get improved, but you can't see your stats growth 100%, you can only see things like the HP getting bigger. The option to choose each character's equipment would also be very usefull!\n\nSo, I would trully recommend this game to anyone who likes JRPGs!

Like many Japanese RPGs, the MC is a young child (called Rush) who is  estranged from his parents, and naturally this is a key plot point and one of the driving forces behind the story. This is generic and loathsome and not something I enjoy. However, the detestable MC, who is probably named after his tendencies to act brashly and without thought (Very subtle, game.) is one of the few characters I found myself disliking. I rather quickly grew fond of David and his 4 generals, for instance, despite their lack of any given motive other than to serve their leader. In fact, David's motives are perhaps the most confusing of all. I found myself playing on to try and discover what they were.\n\nHowever, along the way, I was swept away by my love for the combat. It's highly detailed and strategy based; you create squads of soldiers and have them perform commands as a group. It's an interesting style and quickly captured my attention. However, it quickly lost it again once I realised how grindy the game is. It's also needlessly complex for newer players, not teaching anything more than "Attack enemies! Heal allies! Win fights! Don't lose!" The character progression system is overly complex, and is never quite explained, to my knowledge. I've done a fair bit of research, and the gist of it is that the more a unit uses a specific type of command, the better it becomes with that type of command (e.g magic, physical attacks, healing spells) and will learn more powerful abilities of that type. However, managing the equipment of your allies is hopelessly complex and grindy and this is where the game falls down. It's painfully slow in the early to mid game, and that's about as far as I got before getting bored and giving up.\n\nIt pains me to say that I don't recommend the game. It's an interesting game with a fairly nice range of characters, and there is some kind of ridiculously complex yet... existing plot. It features magic, so you know it's good. But the monotony, repetitive battles and grindy nature make it far too slow to enjoy. And this is coming from a guy who loves a good grind.","February 18, 2015","false","38.3"," 26 of 48 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","26","48","0","1"

Bah, giving it 20 would be generous!\nI don't mind a difficulty, but I've discovered playing through this sad excuse of a game that there is a difference between being a difficult game, and a frustratingly annoying one. Though the like of demon/dark souls fit the former, this one takes the crown of being the latter. There is little difficulty in TLR except for the one inhereted from the player's lack of any form of solid control. JRPGs were never about skill, but to make one dependant nearly completely no luck? Seriously?\n\nThe shoddy story, poor execution and sub-par coding aren't helping it either.\n\nSquare Enix ruined Final Fantasy, and their attempts to create something new is even worse. Hell, if I had tried this one before FFXIII, I might have saved my self some of its disappointment. I can see the similarities.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/igofast/recommended/23310/","igofast","FordGT90Concept","http://steamcommunity.com/id/igofast/","698 products in account","This game is 99% combat-based and the combat is uninspired.  Every turn, you only get five choices as to what to do and those choices appear to be predetermined.  This leads to frustration because, for example, in a boss fight your "union" (group of up to 5 troops) may lose half of their health in one attack.  Logic dicates you better heal up so you can survive another attack.  Game doesn't give you the option because your health isn't low enough.  Then there's random number generator (RNG) ♥♥♥♥ where the AI does their most powerful attack (sometimes capable of taking out multiple unions in one attack) repeatedly.  Game over, man, game over.  Even if you're leveled well beyond the enemy you're fighting, you may have to retry the fight many times before the RNG decides in your favor handing you a victory.  Games like this should be about knowing thy enemy and stratgizing, not random rolls.  In order to progress in the game without getting ♥♥♥♥♥ all of the time, you have to grind, and grind, and grind some more.  I'm asking myself why?  I've got two other games I'd rather play right now and it's not like this game has convinced me the story is worth finishing.  It's disjointed and explains little.  I started feeling apathetic towards the plot about 30 hours ago.  The only reason why I care about the plot is because it is the only way to command more unions and get more troops to put in said unions.\n\nI could go on a long time nitpicking about lots of things from the bland environments (pathetic for a 2008 game) to the repetitive music (I think there's only one combat song and that only changes if morale gets to the bottom) to the quick-time-events (you want to look at health guages, attacks coming up, etc. but if you do that, you'll miss the QTE which could easily translate to losing the battle) to the inability to change troop equipment (they ask to "borrow" equipment from your unequipped inventory).\n\nI suppose there's some people out there that love this kind of game but I am not among them.\n\n\nEdit: The above was written after 37 hours of playing the game.  Because I was long past tired of the combat, H4X0R Mode Engaged! (one hit kills on unions) and the game still took 65 total hours to finish.  I think this would be a pretty darn good game if it ended in ~40 hours but the combat...just...drags...on...forever...and ever...and ever...  it gets in the way of everything else that is otherwise passable.","January 16","false","65.1"," 28 of 52 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","28","52","2","2"

Unfortunately, much of the game is very poorly explained if explained at all, forcing the player to look up all of the game's numerous mechanics. So much of the game design is unintuitive and very strange, such as the idea that it's actually preferrable to avoid random fights to keep your battle rank lower and make important fights easier and the inability to easily directly choose which spells or skills to use in battle, that trying to play through the game without the use of any outside resources will probably be a very confusing experience.

A big improvement though is apart from the main character, anybody else will be treated equally on the battlefield which make the game extremely interesting and fun to play.  Speaking of the amount of characters, the game offer you up to 25 chatacters to be on the battlefield at one time ( 5 team of 5 ), you will be controlling a team called "union", to give order to your troops, the action each troops can take are very situational base, since you are controlling up to 5 characters at one time, the game use a function to give each troops their own chance to use their skills. This might cone at a negative to some person since you can't directly control one particular character and command him to use certain skill at that specific time, but he/she will be using it automatically if the situation is met. The tutorial is there, though it doesn't go in depth of how and when is the appropriate time to use some of the function. The QTE they include in the fight are extremely nice, it make the game goes from spam Attack to win to you have to pay attention on the game in case some of those QTE come in so you can power up your attack or counter the enemy attack with your own for HUGE damage. Which of course have its down side on that it's more centered toward luck-base than strategy for the QTE. Speaking of QTE, another HUGE downside of the game came from the fact that it have the "turbo mode" option available for you to speed up the fighting progress of the game, it speed up the animation of the fighting scene and here is a problem that they might not noticed before, the QTE's speed in turbo mode is also much, MUCH quicker, so quick that it's impossible for any human to react to the right QTE sequence on time which in turns, making the QTE in turbo mode, impossible and thus, might lose you in the match that require some QTE action.\nSound : Oh my god, SE did it again with its awesome soundtrack that will capture anyone's heart.\nIn total, for the price tag of 10$, I would recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of RPG ( first timer are not the target audience of this game ). If you're a fan of ANY of the FF series, Dragon Quest series or  just any game from SE in general, you will probably love this game. I have no idea why metacritics critics have been giving this game a low score of 66 ( users at 82 ), I think it deserve better though the story line is, as you guess it, very final fantasy-like.","December 5, 2013","true","16.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The more monsters you kill, the higher your battle rank goes. This will lead to bosses and other enemies scaling to your battle rank to be a lot more tougher to provide you with bigger challenge. That's fine, in fact, I like the idea as it seems similar to the Final Fantasy 8's level scale system. However, there is no real character level in this game and you are randomly given stat increases after certain number of battle based on how high your battle rank is as well as what kind of commands you have given out to your party members during combat.\n\nWhat this means is that your enemies may scale with your battle rank and grow stronger consistently while your own party may or may not and this can lead someone to completely stagnate themselves at certain points in this game. There is no real sense of progression, it's more favorable decision to avoid any side quests and field enemy encounters to keep things in balance.

The 'thing' with Last Remnant is the combat system that lets you put up to an army of characters into battle for you. To do this however the game engine has a lot of complexity and much is this is shielded from the player by automation. If you let the automation do everything then you're not involved much and your characters won't improve. However the problems come when you naturally try to understand what's happening and manage the automaton. Unfortunately, it's just difficult to get past the automation and the manual doesn't help you to do it at all. For example there massive amount of detailed itemization in the game and it is important to equip your characters well, however you can't give them items unless they ask for it. They typically won't ask for stuff you want them to have, but if they do they ask for the wrong item, the wrong person asks for it, the same person asks for everything, and even if they take something they might discard it for something worse later. That's just one side of the itemisation problems as well.\n\nSo anyway, there are a lot of good things in just playing Last Remnant but it encourages you look into the complexity and disappoints when it is frequently opaque.","October 11, 2014","false","489.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sadly the game has an extremely poor reputation from the xbox world where I understand that it is sub par. On the PC however, the game is absolutely beautiful and suprisingly deep. The story won't win any awards for originality I suppose, but personally I really enjoyed it.\nThe main draw of the game however is the turn based combat with a twist. Instead of giving individual party members a command, you assemble small armies and assign them a general strategy to execute over the course of a turn. While this system can seem shallow and perhaps frustrating to those without the patience to learn its intricacies, it is one of the most enjoyable battle sysyems I have ever used in an RPG. Building and customizing each union and your overall team is a lot of fun. If you seek out the sidequests in the game (which easily adds more than 50% more content) you will often find yourself with access to many more allies with which to customize your team.\nIn all honestly if you have no interest in making a decent investment into learning the sysyem then this may not be the game for you. If, on the other hand, you enjoy learning and mastering an intricate combat system, turn based combat, hours and hours of sidequests and a beautiful world to explore, extremely challenging optional bosses, and beautiful looking combat, you will probably love TLR as much as I do.","December 31, 2013","true","665.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That version was buggy as all get-out and nearly unplayable and, as such, was reviewed with a very strong negative light. This version fixes pretty much every single graphical and technical issue that made that one unplayable and thus is allowed to shine.\n\nI'm mostly a console gamer these days(even though I've been playing PC and Console games both since I was 4 in 1987), so I live for Square Enix games and know their history very well. I worshipped at their feet in the glory days before the merger. They haven't been great since, but for me, The Last Remnant is one of the few standout IPs they've had since they left their old Squaresoft monicre behind them.\n\nThis game is equal parts JRPG, strategy, and story-driven RPG. The combat is the main draw and probably the most unique form of turn-based I've seen in many years. Battles take place in a pseudo-strategic form where the player holds many groups of 3+ toons forming smaller parties broken off from the main group of up to 25 party members. You can fight groups of enemies as large as 75+ forming wave after wave and it really lends itself to the whole "continental war" vibe that the story tries to evoke. It's something you don't see often, if ever and it's very engrossing.\n\nThere is well over 100 hours of content to explore from sidequests to mob hunting to the main story itself and it very rarely gets old. On the pc, t graphics shine and the art style and creativity of the world is awe-inspiring at times. It is, again, something largely unique in the world of JRPGs. It doesn't feel too much like Final Fantasy, but you can see the influence.\n\nOne of the best aspects of this game, believe it or not, is the music. Take the best soundtracks of the FF franchise and combine it with hard rock compositions by some of Japans best and you have a soundtrack unlike any other out there. I bought the 3+ disc soundtrack I love it so much. It really heightens the impact during combat and brings you in that much more.\n\nAll in all I'd say any lover of JRPGs will love this game. It didn't get it's fair chance because SquEnix botched their chance with the ill-adviced 360 version. Rest assured that this game is 100% playable and will be well worth the cost.","December 31, 2013","true","414.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But yeah, it has a LOT of content, if you do everything.\n\nSo what is this game about? You assemble a team of people, put them together into units (called unions) and do battle in turns. Depending on who you put together into a union the actual commands they get in battle change and depending on which skills your guys/gals use they level different abilities and stats, which in turn affects which classes they will get into. There are also different formations for your unions to use, which affects the stats of the union.\n\nWell, that sure sounds complicated, but rejoice most of this game is easily beatable by just doing whatever sounds good to you.  So you don't have to get into the depth of it if you don't want to, though for me that was part of the fun. It is a really good easy to use but hard to master/really understand type of system.\nThere are a few optional bosses that are very very hard and beating them may require some kind of special tactics. It feels incredible rewarding when you are finally able to beat them, though.\n\nDoes the game have any drawbacks? To be honest the story is kinda "eh whatever", but there are tons of optional stuff to distract you from it. The story battles however are pretty awesome.

It's leveling system is extremely confusing. Basically you have to avoid getting your Battle Rank too high or else the game becomes impossible to beat. Aside from that issue, the game itself is gorgeous, unique and different. If you enjoy immersing yourself in a new world this would be the game for you. It's a turn based RPG with a different take on the battle. You control small squads rather than a single person. It's extremely interesting finding all the quests and loot.

Every system goes several layers deep and while the depth is interesting, it's a little too complicated for anyone but the most hardcore fans to enjoy.\n\nIt wasn't until about 20 hours in that I started to grasp the battle system. Even though I was reading outside information about the game it wasn't as helpful as actually playing the game and after beating the game I'm still not sure about some things. Most people on the internet suggest to keep your battle rating low, but I was constantly running into roadblocks of luck-based fights that were frustrating.\n\nMost of the quests are fine. I liked that they take you directly to the area you need to be almost all the time, but they also make you leave right as you finish the quest as well. This isn't a problem except there are several quests that end with items in the room you finish the quest in, and then it instantly teleports you home. I'd rather talk to someone to port me home so I could get that stuff.\n\nI completed every quest in the game and felt pretty good about the game going up to the last boss. Completing all the quests screwed me, since the final boss was simply too strong for my team and required way too much grinding to get by. Although it's cool that the game changes depending on how you play almost none of it is obvious at any time.\n\nIn fact, almost none of the game's systems are surfaced. From some quest parameters to learning skills to equipping friends with items, there is no information at all about the game. The extremely limited tutorial only covers union attacks from different directions. In the Xbox 360 version there are loading screens with tips, but these were taken out of the PC version. Most of the time I resorted to the helpful wiki and an external program that hooks into the game to display things like enemy health and what the heck a class like an "Expert Swashbuckler" does.\n\nI found the environments to be boring. So many corridors and caves with few paths that usually just lead to items. A few scenes were pretty, but the majority of the game made me feel claustrophobic.\n\nDespite all that, there's something to this game's battle system that is fun and feels good to play with after learning its intricacies. Breaking this game was a joy, learning new spells and training familiar ones is good (though complex) and fighting requires tactics that I rarely see in RPGs. I just wish that stuff was surfaced a lot more in the game.\n\nThere's a reason that this game still has an active community - this game probably has thousands of ways to play it and no two playthroughs will be the same. If you can get past the massive hurdles that are required to play this, The Last Remnant is a perfectly average RPG that offers a ton of depth in its battle system.","March 20, 2015","true","30.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The main protagonist is horrible and unintelligent and unlikeable, and I'm starting to think that maybe that was intentional?? He's basically jRPG George Bush Jr. as a teenager.\n\nThe combat system though is pretty awesome and I wish other games used something like it. A final fantasy 9 remake with this combat system would be the ♥♥♥♥. You have characters and they're put into little squadrons that fight together as a single unit, and how you attack and approach enemies and the angle you use (and subsequently, the ones they use) determine not only your damage bonuses/maluses and the abilities/tricks you can use but also how the morale bar progresses (either towards the enemy side or your side). Understadnably, the morale bar is best on your side, as it has a severe effect on everything.  Its very strateigic and a good play can easily turn the tide of battle in even overwhelming situations.\n\nHowever, a severe downside is the sheer amount of grinding and gathering you have to do. Dear goodness. You can certainly play through the game without doing any but you'll eventually hit a brick wall of 'this is way too hard even if I play this perfectly' 3/4ths through the game (I did that).  You have to grind this, collect that, grind that, grind this, grind that, so your characters all level up in their weapon and level their weapon up and level what weapons they can craft up and level what weapons their crafted weapons can craft up and level what's availible from shops to aid in crafting that sword to craft an axe to switch over to another skill set and do it all over again for 30+ odd characters.\n\n\n\nNope.

The world that is presented to you is interesting but many of the characters are incredibly annoying and story telling isn't particularly good either. The main character is a whiney little brat that makes stupid decisions one after another. The game also has a very deep character development system but it is muddled with hidden stats which make it difficult to tell if you're going the right direction.\n\nThe combat system has potential to be great but it is very frustrating. Besides the extremely frustrating battle command system, it's not uncommon to run into battles where you can be instantly wiped out without anything you can do to prevent it so saving is your best friend. 1 union vs 5? Yeah, you don't even get the option to heal and round one you die. Boss fight? He's got an aoe attack that can 1 shot your party and uses it every other turn. Without using a guide, figuring out the battle commands is nearly impossible and even using a guide, it is often quite frustrating. Character development is also annoying because there are many hidden stats that are factoring into character class and development. If these stats were visible, it would make the game much better and if you could always tell your units exactly what to do it would make the game immensely better. But that is not the case so it lends itself to an incredibly frustrating learning curve.\n\nIf I had paid full price for this I would have returned it in a heartbeat. At $4 I still feel annoyed that I spent the money on it. I feel like this game had a lot of potential that just wasn't capitalized on.\n\nIf you do end up giving it a shot, don't grind early on. It only hurts you. And start reading a guide from the start to save yourself a ragequit. If you're not using a controller, in the game settings on the controller page, there is an option to change which buttons the tooltips show (xbox, ps3, keyboard, etc.). Change this to keyboard. And to skip cutscenes, hit Pause/Break and then S to skip.","April 5, 2014","false","18.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's got a solid foundation, with an interesting game mechanic, and it reminds of classic Final Fantasy games.  However, there are really serious flaws that make a possibly great game almost unplayable.  Unless you are a big nerd for JRPGs, stay away.\n\nSome of the flaws are as follows:\n\n1. This is a port of the XBox game.  They didn't even bother to change the quicktime icons that appear during battle, and they don't tell you what they are, either, but they are in the settings.  Still, it's a lazy job of porting it that undercuts the quality of the game significantly.\n\n2.  The battle mechanic is interesting, but ultimately flawed - it's almost like there wasn't enough playtesting.  Skills that target one enemy are the norm, and what the majority of both your characters and enemy characters use.  Unfortunately, the game is quickly dominated by AoE spells capable of killing multiple units.  Characters are organized into groups, which have a shared HP pool, and if they are hit by an AoE spell, it may just hurt one character, or it may hit them all (including characters in other groups).  Because the shared HP is much less than the sum of each character's HP, a group hit usually results in the group being seriously injured or killed in one shot, and too many enemies cast group attacks.  The group attacks should have been seriously nerfed.  On the bright side, you also get these spells - but then the game simply consists of you figuring out which action choice will lead to your character busting out one of these AoE spells and then doing that over and over.\n\n3.  Speaking of action choices: it's only possible to give up to 5 orders (per enemy) - this means that a unit that desperately needs to perform a certain act might not be able to, for reasons that are never clear.  Additionally, you can only ask for certain classes of actions to be performed, rather than specific abilities.  This is kind of neat, as it leaves only the larger tactics to you, but the problem is that the AI is flaky.  Your units will often do stupid things, like target a single unit with a group spell, or just fail to cast a useful spell because the enemy group has been defeated (but the battle is not over).   Also, you may have a TON of AP, but you may only get options to use a few, and so you waste a turn because of the game, not because of some mistake on your part.\n\nAdditionally, the plot is some Square Enix gibberish that is completely unengaging.  Square-Enix used to be one of my favorite publishers, and I would really love a good Final Fantasy style game.  If they would stick with the stuff that worked instead of trying to innovate, they could really make some very good games.","April 13, 2014","false","79.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sadly, I was disappointed to find out how big of a let down this game was.\n\nJumping into the game without knowing anything about it aside from the title, I was pleasantly surprise and confused to see the game in action, jumping straight into the first battle. But seeing the game in action, it caught my interests and I was more than excited to continue and try to figure out how the game worked. Unfortunately, after 12+ hours of playing, the game felt like it was on a constant tutorial, only to find out the game really didn't have much to offer. As interesting as the game looked, the strategy within the game play comes off as extremely shallow, leaving little to no planning even in the most difficult combat situations. The idea behind the game play is extremely interesting and had so much potential, but alas falls short, lacking depth in every aspect behind it. In other words; what you see is what you get.\n\nThe story itself is a complete joke, as it feels like it's parody of an old anime that I've never seen before. It makes senses, but the story is laughably lame, as with the behavior the main character is so unpredictable yet very forgivable regardless of the outcome.\n\nThe dungeon design are completely lack luster, as it feels like almost every dungeon is design to be shaped like a Y or an L, and copy paste from there. I never felt lost, and had I come across a dead end, I back track over to a fork in the path I missed, pulled a trigger, and the dead end was averted. Funny thing is, that's basically every dungeon in the game.\n\nThe Battle music in this game is great, fitting the tone and idle animations of the characters fighting off their opponents as they wait for you to make a decision on their next action. It's a nice touch, as it almost looks like the party members are hyped up with the music, which also gives out a great arcade-ish feel for each battle (which is not a bad thing for me). Sadly, all songs outside the battle tracks are completely forgettable.\n\nAll in honestly, I'd say to avoid this title at all cost and play another RPG title instead... literally any other RPG.

The more monsters you kill, the higher your battle rank goes. This will lead to bosses and other enemies scaling to your battle rank to be a lot more tougher to provide you with bigger challenge. That's fine, in fact, I like the idea as it seems similar to the Final Fantasy 8's level scale system. However, there is no real character level in this game and you are randomly given stat increases after certain number of battle based on how high your battle rank is as well as what kind of commands you have given out to your party members during combat.\n\nWhat this means is that your enemies may scale with your battle rank and grow stronger consistently while your own party may or may not and this can lead someone to completely stagnate themselves at certain points in this game. There is no real sense of progression, it's more favorable decision to avoid any side quests and field enemy encounters to keep things in balance.

The 'thing' with Last Remnant is the combat system that lets you put up to an army of characters into battle for you. To do this however the game engine has a lot of complexity and much is this is shielded from the player by automation. If you let the automation do everything then you're not involved much and your characters won't improve. However the problems come when you naturally try to understand what's happening and manage the automaton. Unfortunately, it's just difficult to get past the automation and the manual doesn't help you to do it at all. For example there massive amount of detailed itemization in the game and it is important to equip your characters well, however you can't give them items unless they ask for it. They typically won't ask for stuff you want them to have, but if they do they ask for the wrong item, the wrong person asks for it, the same person asks for everything, and even if they take something they might discard it for something worse later. That's just one side of the itemisation problems as well.\n\nSo anyway, there are a lot of good things in just playing Last Remnant but it encourages you look into the complexity and disappoints when it is frequently opaque.","October 11, 2014","false","489.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sadly the game has an extremely poor reputation from the xbox world where I understand that it is sub par. On the PC however, the game is absolutely beautiful and suprisingly deep. The story won't win any awards for originality I suppose, but personally I really enjoyed it.\nThe main draw of the game however is the turn based combat with a twist. Instead of giving individual party members a command, you assemble small armies and assign them a general strategy to execute over the course of a turn. While this system can seem shallow and perhaps frustrating to those without the patience to learn its intricacies, it is one of the most enjoyable battle sysyems I have ever used in an RPG. Building and customizing each union and your overall team is a lot of fun. If you seek out the sidequests in the game (which easily adds more than 50% more content) you will often find yourself with access to many more allies with which to customize your team.\nIn all honestly if you have no interest in making a decent investment into learning the sysyem then this may not be the game for you. If, on the other hand, you enjoy learning and mastering an intricate combat system, turn based combat, hours and hours of sidequests and a beautiful world to explore, extremely challenging optional bosses, and beautiful looking combat, you will probably love TLR as much as I do.","December 31, 2013","true","665.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That version was buggy as all get-out and nearly unplayable and, as such, was reviewed with a very strong negative light. This version fixes pretty much every single graphical and technical issue that made that one unplayable and thus is allowed to shine.\n\nI'm mostly a console gamer these days(even though I've been playing PC and Console games both since I was 4 in 1987), so I live for Square Enix games and know their history very well. I worshipped at their feet in the glory days before the merger. They haven't been great since, but for me, The Last Remnant is one of the few standout IPs they've had since they left their old Squaresoft monicre behind them.\n\nThis game is equal parts JRPG, strategy, and story-driven RPG. The combat is the main draw and probably the most unique form of turn-based I've seen in many years. Battles take place in a pseudo-strategic form where the player holds many groups of 3+ toons forming smaller parties broken off from the main group of up to 25 party members. You can fight groups of enemies as large as 75+ forming wave after wave and it really lends itself to the whole "continental war" vibe that the story tries to evoke. It's something you don't see often, if ever and it's very engrossing.\n\nThere is well over 100 hours of content to explore from sidequests to mob hunting to the main story itself and it very rarely gets old. On the pc, t graphics shine and the art style and creativity of the world is awe-inspiring at times. It is, again, something largely unique in the world of JRPGs. It doesn't feel too much like Final Fantasy, but you can see the influence.\n\nOne of the best aspects of this game, believe it or not, is the music. Take the best soundtracks of the FF franchise and combine it with hard rock compositions by some of Japans best and you have a soundtrack unlike any other out there. I bought the 3+ disc soundtrack I love it so much. It really heightens the impact during combat and brings you in that much more.\n\nAll in all I'd say any lover of JRPGs will love this game. It didn't get it's fair chance because SquEnix botched their chance with the ill-adviced 360 version. Rest assured that this game is 100% playable and will be well worth the cost.","December 31, 2013","true","414.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Every system goes several layers deep and while the depth is interesting, it's a little too complicated for anyone but the most hardcore fans to enjoy.\n\nIt wasn't until about 20 hours in that I started to grasp the battle system. Even though I was reading outside information about the game it wasn't as helpful as actually playing the game and after beating the game I'm still not sure about some things. Most people on the internet suggest to keep your battle rating low, but I was constantly running into roadblocks of luck-based fights that were frustrating.\n\nMost of the quests are fine. I liked that they take you directly to the area you need to be almost all the time, but they also make you leave right as you finish the quest as well. This isn't a problem except there are several quests that end with items in the room you finish the quest in, and then it instantly teleports you home. I'd rather talk to someone to port me home so I could get that stuff.\n\nI completed every quest in the game and felt pretty good about the game going up to the last boss. Completing all the quests screwed me, since the final boss was simply too strong for my team and required way too much grinding to get by. Although it's cool that the game changes depending on how you play almost none of it is obvious at any time.\n\nIn fact, almost none of the game's systems are surfaced. From some quest parameters to learning skills to equipping friends with items, there is no information at all about the game. The extremely limited tutorial only covers union attacks from different directions. In the Xbox 360 version there are loading screens with tips, but these were taken out of the PC version. Most of the time I resorted to the helpful wiki and an external program that hooks into the game to display things like enemy health and what the heck a class like an "Expert Swashbuckler" does.\n\nI found the environments to be boring. So many corridors and caves with few paths that usually just lead to items. A few scenes were pretty, but the majority of the game made me feel claustrophobic.\n\nDespite all that, there's something to this game's battle system that is fun and feels good to play with after learning its intricacies. Breaking this game was a joy, learning new spells and training familiar ones is good (though complex) and fighting requires tactics that I rarely see in RPGs. I just wish that stuff was surfaced a lot more in the game.\n\nThere's a reason that this game still has an active community - this game probably has thousands of ways to play it and no two playthroughs will be the same. If you can get past the massive hurdles that are required to play this, The Last Remnant is a perfectly average RPG that offers a ton of depth in its battle system.","March 20, 2015","true","30.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The main protagonist is horrible and unintelligent and unlikeable, and I'm starting to think that maybe that was intentional?? He's basically jRPG George Bush Jr. as a teenager.\n\nThe combat system though is pretty awesome and I wish other games used something like it. A final fantasy 9 remake with this combat system would be the ♥♥♥♥. You have characters and they're put into little squadrons that fight together as a single unit, and how you attack and approach enemies and the angle you use (and subsequently, the ones they use) determine not only your damage bonuses/maluses and the abilities/tricks you can use but also how the morale bar progresses (either towards the enemy side or your side). Understadnably, the morale bar is best on your side, as it has a severe effect on everything.  Its very strateigic and a good play can easily turn the tide of battle in even overwhelming situations.\n\nHowever, a severe downside is the sheer amount of grinding and gathering you have to do. Dear goodness. You can certainly play through the game without doing any but you'll eventually hit a brick wall of 'this is way too hard even if I play this perfectly' 3/4ths through the game (I did that).  You have to grind this, collect that, grind that, grind this, grind that, so your characters all level up in their weapon and level their weapon up and level what weapons they can craft up and level what weapons their crafted weapons can craft up and level what's availible from shops to aid in crafting that sword to craft an axe to switch over to another skill set and do it all over again for 30+ odd characters.\n\n\n\nNope.

There isn't a very steep learning curve, but you will most certainly miss things on your first play through than you would if you had known a few things. For example, there's some side missions that unlock certain playable characters that are amazing but they're only open for a limited time, and if you progress in your story you will miss the opportunity to recruit them.\n\nAs far as battles go, the fighting is pretty simple, you can set up your characters to form unions (or squads) which pool stats, which I thought was a little disappointing because I really wanted to be able to attack certain characters differently\nand position mine differently. Not a bad point, just different from what I'm used to. They have a sort of Limit Break attack move for certain characters like most Square games.\n\nIf you do get to check this game out, be sure to play through without a guide first, then check out what you missed, I had a load of fun this way.\n\nIncase you decide to check the guide out first or run through with a guide:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=113566410\n\nIn short, I would recommend TLR because it's different but still has a Square uniqueness of fun to it.

Each character will be placed in a squad of 5 (max) and will act on a general command, such as attack with magical arts, etc. Usually, the available commands are influenced by the abilities of the squad leader and the condition of the battle (if they're dying or if another squad needs help etc.). However, you will not be able to directly control what type of action each individual will perform. For example, the command is to inflict ailments, but you cannot specify whether to silence them, poison them, etc.\n\nHowever, sometimes characters may change their actions depending on the situation. This is usually due to a successful quick time event (QTE), high morale, etc. Sometimes characters will perform healing abilities because they just need healing, or the command was to offer support to others (not a direct command to heal) or the character's class is just inclined to healing. This makes battles much more dynamic and unpredictable. This all leads up to one thing.\n\nSatisfying boss fights. I can say without a doubt, the best thing about this game is how challenging and enjoyable the fights that matter can be. It's the strong point of the game. Paired with secret and extra bosses that are even more challenging, this is what truly makes the game shine.\n\nUnfortunately, to get there may take some patience as there are mechanics or stats that are not detailed enough, there is no  way to directly give items to your party members, and getting said items may lead into a dull grind. It should also be noted that to be a perfectionist in this game, it will require you to consult the wiki frequently. But then, every good game deserves a wiki, and the Last Remnant is definitely a good game.\n\n","May 19, 2014","true","140.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Aside from the lore which I barely understand in a game that I'm told runs for at least 70 hours more, I know that I'm plunged into a world that is about to hit the fan and feces will start flying all around.\n\nGameplay wise it resembles FFXIII (rather, FFXIII resembles this game) on the world map and in "dungeons" but that is not always bad. The real difference comes in the combat scenarios which are extremely more complicated and tactical than FFXIII ever was. You have several units (made from 1-5 soldiers) fighting various assortments of units at the same time, and you have to coordinate who attacks what and if you make up the wrong choice, you'll have another unit intercept yours for a negative morale hit (morale is basically how well your forces think the battle is going. if it's going good, they'll do more damage, and vice versa)\n\nStorywise, it's what you expect from a Square(Enix, yuck) game. Extremely complex, lots of names to memorize at once, interesting cartography, etc.\n\nTL;DR: Got this game on a sale. I'm at 10 hours and I bought it for like 5$.

Each character will be placed in a squad of 5 (max) and will act on a general command, such as attack with magical arts, etc. Usually, the available commands are influenced by the abilities of the squad leader and the condition of the battle (if they're dying or if another squad needs help etc.). However, you will not be able to directly control what type of action each individual will perform. For example, the command is to inflict ailments, but you cannot specify whether to silence them, poison them, etc.\n\nHowever, sometimes characters may change their actions depending on the situation. This is usually due to a successful quick time event (QTE), high morale, etc. Sometimes characters will perform healing abilities because they just need healing, or the command was to offer support to others (not a direct command to heal) or the character's class is just inclined to healing. This makes battles much more dynamic and unpredictable. This all leads up to one thing.\n\nSatisfying boss fights. I can say without a doubt, the best thing about this game is how challenging and enjoyable the fights that matter can be. It's the strong point of the game. Paired with secret and extra bosses that are even more challenging, this is what truly makes the game shine.\n\nUnfortunately, to get there may take some patience as there are mechanics or stats that are not detailed enough, there is no  way to directly give items to your party members, and getting said items may lead into a dull grind. It should also be noted that to be a perfectionist in this game, it will require you to consult the wiki frequently. But then, every good game deserves a wiki, and the Last Remnant is definitely a good game.\n\n","May 19, 2014","true","140.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Aside from the lore which I barely understand in a game that I'm told runs for at least 70 hours more, I know that I'm plunged into a world that is about to hit the fan and feces will start flying all around.\n\nGameplay wise it resembles FFXIII (rather, FFXIII resembles this game) on the world map and in "dungeons" but that is not always bad. The real difference comes in the combat scenarios which are extremely more complicated and tactical than FFXIII ever was. You have several units (made from 1-5 soldiers) fighting various assortments of units at the same time, and you have to coordinate who attacks what and if you make up the wrong choice, you'll have another unit intercept yours for a negative morale hit (morale is basically how well your forces think the battle is going. if it's going good, they'll do more damage, and vice versa)\n\nStorywise, it's what you expect from a Square(Enix, yuck) game. Extremely complex, lots of names to memorize at once, interesting cartography, etc.\n\nTL;DR: Got this game on a sale. I'm at 10 hours and I bought it for like 5$.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pietoro/recommended/23310/","pietoro","Pietoro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pietoro/","43 products in account","The game has an interesting take on turn-based combat (directing multiple parties of characters that share stats  and move as one unit rather than as individuals); however a lot of the nuances of the mechanics are not well-explained within the game itself. I'd recommend browsing a wiki on basic gameplay to get a better handle on the mechanics the game has.\n\nIf you like JRPGs and turn-based games it's worth checking out, imo, though for people who prefer 100% control over every combat decision the variable nature (based on party makeup, party leader, and positioning) of combat commands in battle might be annoying. Basically, most of the strategic thought goes into setting up your parties' characters and their skills beforehand, and then adapting to whatever options you get during the actual combat turns. It may feel a little too random for some people, though you can stack the deck in your favor if you know what you're going for with your group/skill makeup. There are around fifty unique characters that you can choose to recruit into your parties -- some are linked to the main story while others are hidden and can only be obtained after doing certain side quests, as well as 'generic' soldiers that you can hire to pad your army.\n\nThe art direction and music are top-notch -- the game looks beautiful on the PC. Areas themselves are linear, though there are many side quests and hidden regions available if you want a break from the main storyline. A lot of the side content can become unavailable permanently if you progress too far in the main story without exploring every area (though there is the benefit of being able to start a New Game + after your first playthrough).\nDespite the game's setting being original and interesting, the lead character is a bit of a dope and the main story is not that great, unfortunately (the writing is pretty weak). I honestly enjoyed doing the side content (which includes defeating rare miniboss monsters) more than following the main scenario.\n\nThe Last Remnant is unique compared to any other turn-basd RPG I've played, so it's hard to make a blanket statement of recommendation; it really depends on your personal tastes. Basically, your mileage may vary; if you play JRPGs primarily as visual novels and prefer an epic cinematic storyline  with typical gameplay, then this may not be a game for you. But if you are a fan of turn-based combat and are open to investing the time to learn the nuances of this game's unique mechanics (and are a collector and completionist-type), then you might enjoy it.","February 4, 2014","true","98.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Let's break the issues down:\n\n- Fighting/Turn based whatever: this is pretty much random. You can attack an enemy, but even though it's your turn sometimes enemies get more turns than you do, and even take your turn! As soon as you reach a level of 25+ and progress through the storyline, then this becomes a problem since you get your a** kicked REALLY badly.\n\n- Grinding: I wandered around a lot in this game, trying to get more XP in order to unlock some magic, special skill, new areas, collectables, and so on, as it is in any RPG. For example, exploring areas around you and encountering enemies it's always for the sake of a good battle but.... as you read in my first point, I soon realised that this game is not meant for exploration because exploration means fighting (of course, you meet enemies and even if you try to avoid them, you'll probable end up in bloody mess with attacks from everywhere), and it's not about the classic role playing gaming you are used to. This game does not want you to explore or fight - which is the main thing about RPGs - , else you end up with a really high level and you are f***ed as every fight will be a disaster and you'll probably end up using a trainer in order to just finish the game and just delete it forever. Ok, you might say that there is a challenge, however there isn't hardly a challenge here; the game is unfair at all levels, the AI will be just concatenating attacks even if it's your turn, and if you want to have great weapons and "hoping" to kick some enemies' a**es , well you can only get those by collecting materials (killing enemies?) and exploring, and then? Ha! Well, then the enemies will level up as well, so it's just a pointless chain.\n\nIf you have time to spend, have patience to spend months and months on this game just to reach an ending to a story that is not really that great tbh, and if you don't like classic RPGs, then go ahead. I strongly suggest not to play this game if you don't want to end up hating RPGs.\n\nI think I should go back and play some good old Skies of Arcadia.\n\nI'm so glad I completed this game, finally.","June 22, 2014","false","45.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I checked the Wiki and managed to get about halfway through the game and about 1/3 done with all side-quests. I've simply given up on this game; I was going to try to 100% it, but I simply can't. It's too bad.\n\nFor starters, the writing is incredibly bad. Rush Sykes is, by far, not only the most one-dimensional main character but also is by far the most annoying in any video game I've ever played. His only motivation is his sister; of course, it's charismatic and very noble that he wants to go so far to save his sister, but that's it. No other interests, nothing in his life. Hell, none of the other characters really have anything going on in their lives either. It's all "for Athlum" this or "for Rush's sister Irina" that. All the characters are incredibly flat and unbelievable; usually I'm able to find a character I love, but I simply couldn't here. I cared for absolutely nobody during my time playing. They all seemed to be pawn's for my battles, and that was it. Nothing more.\n\nYou have no control over any of the characters during combat - you can specify what sort of action you want them to take (heal, spells, skills, etc), but ultimately you aren't able to change the order these things happen in. This is very frustrating - for instance, I know one of my characters has an attack that can silence enemies, but I can't have him actually use that spell. It's randomized whether he'll use it or not. It's seriously moments like these that lead me to, not only dying, but getting game over over and over again. The game is punishing me for not being able to control my damn characters. You also can't customize their equipment; you're completely limited to changing the main character's equipment throughout.\n\nTo be honest, the world was fascinating at first. I enjoyed how this world did not have the standard human/elf/dwarf paradigm that many RPGs seem to have nowadays. The races constructed here are very unique and unlike anything I'd ever seen in an RPG before. It was truly a nice breath of fresh air. However, I realized that this world feels practically dead. The only real life that seems to be going on is the beasts prowling around the linearly frustrating dungeons or the vastly open, yet still dead, landscapes. NPCs in cities seem to just stand there and really don't offer anything intelligent, or exciting, to say. All the cities in the game really don't have anything going on - they're simply there for getting side quests and for buying new equipment, but really nothing is going on. It all just really felt dead, like they were simply there, which is disappointing. The point of an RPG is to escape into some sort of fantasy world (and typically to save it), but what's the point of trying to escape into a world that doesn't even remotely feel real?\n\nAll in all, I can't recommend this game. I bought it during the Steam Sale (I believe for less than $5) and didn't believe it was worth it for me.

It has its moments but is dragged down by its predictability. There is a decent plot twist at the end but it doesn't help rate it any higher. Stories of unique mercenaries you hire are told through their conversations and related missions. Most of them do have an interesting background (Nora, Violet, etc.). But they could have expanded more on their stories which was dissapointing to say the least.\n\nGameplay 8.5/10\nThe heart of the game is in the gameplay. You can have up to 18 units in your team, split into a maximum of 5 groups called unions. Each character can learn various skills (with Rush being the only one that can learn every move except for Weapon Specific Arts) and their usage of skills gives them roles the field. However, you can only manually equip Rush with whatever he is able to hold.The others upgrade and request either weapons or components on their own (what they request is based on your Battle Rank and what path you chose for them) The combat system itself is turn based strategy. You have to be smart about what abilities you keep on and what commands you choose. You do not specifically choose what they will do in that turn but you can influence their decisions based on their path and what skills you keep on or off. The combat is very deep and doing a full in-depth review of it would take too long. Try the demo to see if it is your taste.\n\nHOWEVER, I must say that looking at various guides (especially the wiki for the game) is very useful in order to understand the stat gain system and its relationship to the Battle Rank system. You may be familiar with the stat gain system if you have played any of the SaGa RPGs (which makes sense because the developer also worked on the SaGa games as well)\n\nGraphics 7/10\nIt is the Unrea Engine so the moves look pretty when they're the flashy moves. Sadly, it is also Square Enix's first attempt using the Unreal Engine so there are many texture pop-in issues (but they recover in a few seconds). The environments without Remnants are relatively bland compared to the areas where Remnants are visible.\n\nMusic 9/10\nThe music is great for each scenario. The fights in open areas is very energetic, the fights in closed areas have a feeling of suspense. The music also changes during fights to match the current morale of the team. If it is low, then the music becomes darker, if the morale is high, it makes you feel like kicking ♥♥♥.\n\nOverall, I give it an 8/10","February 21, 2014","true","399.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It isn't perfect - its battle system is complicated and there are tons of missable quests and areas - but it's got a lot of high points too.  Here is a JPRG with an 18-character party instead of the usual 3-5.  The enemy encounters are large in scale, and each one will nearly always yield tons of loot, which is used in crafting all manner of items.  The graphics are wonderful with some truly outstanding texture work in places (it uses the Unreal Engine 3), and the score (by Black Mages guitarist Tsuyoshi Sekito) is energetic and memorable.  Also, for those put off by the low reviews of the 360 version, know that the PC version is vastly improved in nearly every way (http://lastremnant.wikia.com/wiki/Difference_between_Xbox360_and_PC_version).  The wiki I just linked to is, by the way, an invaluable resource.

With that said, I'll begin.\n\nThe Last Remnant is certainly a unique Square Enix RPG. As opposed to following the formulaic "3-4 party members in an HP and MP driven turn based battle" system, this game tries to implement an original and somewhat unique battle system. The basic elements of a Square Enix RPG are there, but the new features in battle are also very important factors. These new features, however, can be very confusing and overwhelming upon first playing. The battle system still functions, though, and it's enjoyability boils down to the player's understanding of it. The writing is as you'd expect from a Square RPG: Over the top, and very anime esque. This causes the writing on some characters (Most notably, the protagonist) to be very cliche and predictable at times. The graphics are somewhat primitive, but aren't distracting in any way. From what I've heard, the soundtrack ranges from being stale and bland, to awe inspiring. It's really an open bag. My biggest complaint with the game is that it anticipates that the player uses an Xbox 360 controller. So much so, that the tutorial commands use 360 button inputs. However, this can be remedied with a very brief visit to the main screen settings menu.\n\nOverall, The Last Remnant is a game that I would recommend. I realize that I've been somewhat down on it in this review, but it really is not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination. If you're a fan of JRPG's and Square Enix, this is a game for you.","September 7, 2014","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only real flaw I found was the lack of changing tactics on the fly, ie. a group would seek to perform their orders even if it was no longer a valid option for them to do so (out of AP, target group is dead). The game is lengthy, offers a vast choice of party members and compositions, and sports an excellent sound track.\n\nThe storyline is nothing special, but it manages to throw a few unexpected hurdles and twists your way, although every attempt at humour is sadly not in the least bit funny.\n\nThe main hero is an annoying runt, true to jRPG standards, but at least he can be deposed out of his leadership role to cut down on his voice acting.

Lots of cool mechanics here with you controlling multiple groups, the enemies have numbers too. Incredible music, build your army, tons of customization, solid story that gets the job done, and overall almost feels like what FFXII could have been in an alternate world.

You actually have to think in every battle, since no matter how much you grind (or avoid leveling up), to the very end, you can lose your entire group in one turn in a battle against the weakest enemies in the game.\n\nFor those who like to grind and search for hidden stuff, there are plenty of rare monsters to hunt, which can be extremely difficult to find and beat. There are sidequests, some of which are even missable. Some are decent, some are dull fetch quests. All in all, there's a pretty decent amount of content outside of the main quest.\n\nThe main storyline is nothing to write home about, and is pretty predictable unless you're new to (J)RPGs, but it's not the worst I've ran into.

The combat is billed as an RPG/tactics hybrid but it's really more like real-time JRPG combat with a deck-building element. It's something like a more expansive version of Final Fantasy XII's combat, where you control a single party leader while several AI companions make executive decisions based on the orders you issue them. The difference here is that combat has both a 'micro' and a 'macro' component, where both you and the enemy are split up into several parties at once who move about a larger battlefield in turns and mostly engage other parties one-on-one. However, it's also possible to intercept enemy parties (or be intercepted) and to stack multiple parties against one opponent.\n\nIt's not the most complex thing going, but it's one of SE's best attempts at marrying traditional JRPG encounter design to real-time combat, far more successful than something like Final Fantasy XIII.\n\nThe story and characters are compiled out of mostly-familiar elements, but being freed from the constraints of Final Fantasy formula means that it feels a good deal less creatively exhausted than some of the lesser recent FF titles. As the game progresses you get given far more freedom to recruit more and different soldiers, edit party formations and tactics and generally shape the game's combat. The PC version also has Japanese audio available amongst other reasonably comprehensive config settings.","June 12, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The battle system has a bit of a learning curve, but is actually pretty great once you get the hang of it. You actually have to think in every battle, since no matter how much you grind (or avoid leveling up), to the very end, you can lose your entire group in one turn in a battle against the weakest enemies in the game.\n\nFor those who like to grind and search for hidden stuff, there are plenty of rare monsters to hunt, which can be extremely difficult to find and beat. There are sidequests, some of which are even missable. Some are decent, some are dull fetch quests. All in all, there's a pretty decent amount of content outside of the main quest.\n\nThe main storyline is nothing to write home about, and is pretty predictable unless you're new to (J)RPGs, but it's not the worst I've ran into.

The story has many a wonderful plot twist and the characters develop well over the course of the game! It's one downside is the massive difficulty leap that happens once you max your party slots.

I do find combat can get a little hard but once you figure out which combination of group’s works and what tactics to give them then you’ll have to problems mowing down your enemies\n\nYou can also undertake side quests too that help keep a good length in the game and will help you gain more party members and gear.\n\nWith the combat being a little confusing and hard it is easy to give up on the game after a couple of loses but if you stick with it this a good game to get through and will leave you some satisfaction once beat those hard boss fights i give this 7 out 10\n","November 28, 2013","true","21.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It has many, many problems including an extremely convoluted battle system, a character customization and class system which is hard to manage, a world that doesn't really hold together, obviously half-implemented features, recycled monster types, and a plot that's absurd even for a JRPG. It's hard to play properly, easy to screw yourself over with bad decisions early on, and has a protagonist who's only somewhat more tolerable than Tidus.\n\nThat said: I put nearly 200 hours into this game because it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ addictive to some types of players. It's clear that many of the people who worked on Final Fantasy 12 were instrumental to this game, because the art direction is extremely similar (mostly in a good way although the costumes are even more absurd), it has the same sort of "grindy" feel to it, and other similarities both obvious and subtle. There are hundreds and hundreds of different components for item creation and customizaton, a large cast of characters (many of whom have their own optional sub-plots), a guild system with huge amounts of optional tasks, and possibly most importantly, a feeling like you're commanding a small army instead of a fantasy party, since you have can up to 18 characters active at once in up to five "unions" or tactical squads.\n\nThe PC version has integrated all of the XBox DLC, which includes a bunch of optional superbosses that are pretty much pallette-swaps of existing ones, has more flexible union creation rules (so you can have squads consisting entirely of special characters instead of having to pad them with generic soldier-types), and possibly most important for the obsessive grinding addicts: a fast-forward mode for finishing battles more quickly.

The combat is billed as an RPG/tactics hybrid but it's really more like real-time JRPG combat with a deck-building element. It's something like a more expansive version of Final Fantasy XII's combat, where you control a single party leader while several AI companions make executive decisions based on the orders you issue them. The difference here is that combat has both a 'micro' and a 'macro' component, where both you and the enemy are split up into several parties at once who move about a larger battlefield in turns and mostly engage other parties one-on-one. However, it's also possible to intercept enemy parties (or be intercepted) and to stack multiple parties against one opponent.\n\nIt's not the most complex thing going, but it's one of SE's best attempts at marrying traditional JRPG encounter design to real-time combat, far more successful than something like Final Fantasy XIII.\n\nThe story and characters are compiled out of mostly-familiar elements, but being freed from the constraints of Final Fantasy formula means that it feels a good deal less creatively exhausted than some of the lesser recent FF titles. As the game progresses you get given far more freedom to recruit more and different soldiers, edit party formations and tactics and generally shape the game's combat. The PC version also has Japanese audio available amongst other reasonably comprehensive config settings.","June 12, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Once I start playing I just keep going for more combat over and over because it is so engrossing to me.  The music is enjoyable and fitting as well, especially how it changes up through a single combat depending on how you're doing...\n\nConcerning the story....negative: the story is mainly told through hints at it; positive: if you pay attention you can figure out the entire story if you do all the side quests, and it leaves you slightly wistful.\n\nSummary: Do get it for the combat; do get it for the music.  Do NOT get it for the voice acting, and unless you appreciate cheese, do not get it for the story (although I actually like it).\n\nAlso, in one respect this game is rather like Ragnarok Online - not in the slightest having to do with gameplay.  There is so much information that if you only have time to play and not to figure out all the mechanics and under-mechanics of how classes work and where items come from, you need the wiki.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FelicityNatura/recommended/23310/","FelicityNatura","The Fluffy Assassin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FelicityNatura/","542 products in account","I wanted to like this game. I really did. When I first played it, it had the look of Final Fantasy XII (that's the latest game in the series I have played so that's why it's my comparison point) and a fairly good story to match. The combat system at first was appealing. It was different, which I liked. However, as the story progressed and I went further into the game, I started to stop liking it and started to loathe it... and loathe it... and loathe it.\n\nThe problems I have with this game are as follows:\n\n1) The combat system. You don't get to fully choose what your unions can do in each turn. You only get to choose from up to five options that the RNG decides what you can choose between (one of which is always the basic attack option). Each set of options changes for each opposing union you can engage so there's a lack of consistency. This means that you will often find situations where you want to heal your units or choose to defend, but only be given the option to attack. When you're being sent into battle against an enemy you know is too strong, you're more than likely going to quit before you get killed.\n\nHow they could have done it: Have a standard set of options available to each union for each opposing union. Standard attack, physical arts, mystic arts, healing arts, defend. Additional options can be added in for relevant opponents or scenarios, such as closing in on distant enemies, using item arts or initiating unique attacks such as Omnistrike or the Gae Bolg. Make it consistent and take away the RNG element that makes the system unreliable.\n\n2) The item system. This is just a catastrophic failure in my opinion. It's overly complicated and to this day I still don't understand half of it. My first problem is why can't you change the equipment of any member of your party except Rush? SERIOUSLY! What the hell, Square? Every other game you've done like this allows you to change the gear of other members of your party. Were you trying so hard to not make another Final Fantasy game that you decided none of them needed equipment changes unless the characters just so happen to ask for it? Once again, you put the player at the mercy of the RNG in a part of the game that shouldn't even be random!\n\nAlso, why did you feel the need to have every member of Rush's group constantly ask for random items? Why did you have to make the system for giving them better equipment overly complicated? It's unwarranted and infuriating, especially since half of the weapons available from the merchants throughout the game have to be given to other members of the party... but only if they randomly happen to ask for it after you've bought it.\n\nMy next problem about the item system relates to the method for upgrading and building weapons and accessories. Why did it have to be so complicated and also not even necessary to proceed with the story? I have not ONCE upgraded any of my weapons nor have I ever created anything new. Reason being, I have never been fortunate enough to possess the very precise consumables needed to do so. Yet, I never felt the need to try to obtain them because the game already provides you with effective pieces of equipment for completing quests or even just exploring areas and finding chests. You added a feature that was confusing and complicated... and then made it completely unnecessary. So my inventory was full of tons of rare enemy drops that I didn't want to sell because I felt I might need them... for no real reason at all.\n\nHow they could have done it: Make it possible to change the equipment of your other party members just like in every other game you've made. If you want to have a weapon crafting system, reduce the requirements for creating them and make the item drops rarer and reduce the numbers of items you can obtain. Also, remove the constant nagging requests from every one of your party members asking for items you've never even heard of. It's pointless and wastes time whenever you go to a city map.\n\n3) The Battle Rank system (including quests). Now this has been the one problem I've encountered most in this game. Many of the walkthroughs and forums online say to keep your battle rank as low as possible and to avoid battles as much as you can and then others say to grind and get it nice and high. Honestly, it's overly confusing and I've found that if you don't engage in battles, you get slaughtered. But it's not just ordinary grinding you have to do. It's the quests. Quests in RPGs are necessary for a simple reason. They provide a source of money, items, allies, experience etc. However, they are OPTIONAL, except in this game. In The Last Remnant, if you don't complete the quests, you will be killed when you get to a boss fight. Why that is, I cannot say. I do however know that it's true. I failed to beat many bosses, so I went away to take on some quests, did as many as I could handle before I got bored, went back to the boss and beat them (after a smaller number of attempts).\n\nNot only this, but you are encouraged to take on the quests before a certain point in the game because if you don't, you lose the opportunity to do all of the quests you left behind and any areas you didn't unlock before that point will be lost for the rest of the game. I consider this to be a massive mistake on Square's part. In Final Fantasy VII, you had to change the discs, but you still had access to most of the elements in the game when you changed them. You only lost the chance to unlock a small number of secrets, but the majority of the game was still available to you. So why did they make The Last Remnant in such a different and quite frankly, horrible way? I don't want to feel pressured to complete what I feel are a bunch of tedious and boring quests just to make sure I can progress in the game, especially since all of the quests I have found follow the same format (except one). Get transported to location. traverse location to find boss. Defeat boss. Claim reward. It gets even more boring because of the fact that you keep running into groups of enemies that will run after you and force you to battle if you can't get away.\n\nI'm going off on a tangent here so I'm going to just end this section.\n\nHow they could have done it: Make quests optional and replace the battle rank system with an ordinary level system that applies to each individual party member (which would make it easier to form even unions with in my opinion). Also, don't revoke access to areas within the game just because you've reached the middle of the game's story, In addition to that, add in different kinds of quests. They don't all have to end in a boss battle. They can be simpler such as delivering items from one area to another. The quests in Final Fantasy XII were varied enough. Why not here?\n\n4) Battle length. This is one of the reasons quests drag on so much. The battles take so long. The animations are not skippable and you have to watch the entire thing even though you're not doing anything yourself.\n\nHow they could have done it: Add an option to skip battle animations and just give the player the outcome of each engagement. Simple.\n\nThere are other gripes I have with the way the game was made but I'm going to leave it there for the simple reason that it's long enough already and I doubt that most of you will have even read the entire review. If you did read it all, go have a cookie. You deserve it.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, I expected a lot more from Square Enix. They're an incredible group and have produced games for one of the most famous RPG titles for years. Yet, The Last Remnant just fails to live up to the name. Had it not been for the way the world was designed and the unique races that you find in the game, I would never have been able to guess it was a Square Enix title if they took their name off of it. I only managed to make it to the Gates of Hell before I just couldn't take it anymore. GG Square. You beat me.","April 9","false","47.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After about 50 hours in I feel it delivered on the side quest, exploration and crafting side---\n\nHOWEVER:\nThe combat is insanely RNG heavy.\nYou don't have control over possitioning of your party and the game punishes you for bad positioning, you also don't have direct control over what attacks/moves your characters perform. Different moves have different modifiers that are strong against different types of monsters but you don't actually get to choose to use these moves, you just have to hope you get them.  There is also a chance you get a roll in combat where your mages only get to choose between Physical attacks and fighters only get to use Magic attacks. The combat can also otherwise completely screw you over when you get a bad roll out eg: you can end up in situations where you need to/want to heal but the game just doesn't let you because you get bad RNG (this has cost my alot of fights). Even if you get the heal option you only really get one of two options: "heal yourself" or "heal someone else" you don't get to choose who that someone else is so you'll just have to cross your fingers and hope.\nThere is a moral system that supposedly rewards you for making good tactical decisions, increasing your damage and defense when you keep moral high. However most of these "decisions" are actually based on RNG and completely outside your control, and several mobs are immune to it anyway making the combat in general favoured towards enemies, especially vs bosses and Rare Enemies.\nThere are no random encounters, so that's good, but there's a system where if an enemy sneaks up on you they get a combat advantage, however there is no way for you to get an early combat advantage over you enemy via something like a pre-emtive strike.\n\nIf you're the kind of person who likes to spend a lot of time getting good gear for your entire team, this game doesn't allow you to do that either as you only have control of the gear on the main character, while everyone else has their own gear that can only be improved with (say it with me) RNG, as they may ask to have some of the gear you're not using if it's better than what they have. The other way to improve you're allies gear is to gather monster loot where your crew MAY ask to have some of it to improve their gear.\n\nLastly all the enemies in the game scale with your "levels" so grinding isn't all that useful, pretty much taking all the point out of leveling. Further more you can't watch how much XP you gain to see how much more you need to get new moves or what you need for your stats to increase, which is just another annoyance in my already page long complaint.","January 8","false","54.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its also too needlessly complicated, as if SEnix was trying to crowbar Tabletop wargame rules into an FF game. It'll take you some time to get a hang of it, and even then, you still won't have a complete grasp of what the hell you're even doing. Still, it has its charms. Combat, once you figure out how the frig it works, is as fun as Final Fantasy RPG combat can be.\n\nAs for the characters.....most of them are generic and tolerable as far as JRPGs go...but GODS help you once you control the main protag "Rush Sykes". I'm not blowing anything out of proportion here. Rush is GODSAWFULLY and unberably annoying. He's your typical upbeat protag found in your typical JRPG, he just sounds and acts annoying. He's so horrible as a protagonist that he is THE SINGLE reason I refused to touch this game after playing for 3 hours.

But if you can look past that, The Last Remnant is one of Square Enix's best titles, incorporating the crafting and scavenging mechanics straight from Monster Hunter, a typical but engaging story with genuine character relationships that never try to oversell it to the audience, a protagonist whose motives are more quaint than "saving the world" and who is as genuinely likeable as he is out of place in a monarchist society, and the single greatest soundtrack ever composed next to Chaos Rings (that alone should be reason enough to buy it). The level up progression is visuably noticable in battle, with low level spells greatly increasing in "oomph" and flair with each upgrade, and the battle chatter really sells the vividity of each battle, especially during huge, multi-squad combat.\n\nHighly recommended.","April 1, 2014","true","11.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The combat was a little unwieldy, and the movement was jerky.  I found the controller support rather nice, though!  And that music is just beautiful.  I love the sound effects, as well.  Everything audio-related is nice except the pauses between voice-overs and the lack of lip sync.\n\nIf you are already a fan of similar games, this may be a nice bargain bin game for you.  If you liked .Hack//Infection, you will probably like how Last Remnant feels similar in regard to shops and the exploration of sectioned-off maps.  If you liked The Legend Of Dragoon, the battle system in The Last Remnant is similar though a lot more simplified and not quite as fun in my opinion.  The movement between sections of the world requires use of a boring map menu system that ruins the immersion and ruins any chance of the game offering exploratory experiences.\n\nAgain, the game offers a lot of content and is a good buy if you want a time-waster, but keep your expectations low in regards to movement, dialogue, story, and looting.","January 7, 2014","true","0.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Also it's pretty easy to ruin your characters by making some wrong decisions, making them more or less useless.\nBeing unable to totally control which action everyone's going to execute adds some difficulty, which is good. The game has a really good atmosphere as well, and it managed to remind me much of the golden era of JRPGs. The battle system and formation setup are both fun to think of and relevant. They aren't just features to make the game seem complex and fancy.","September 18, 2014","true","66.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZlothX/recommended/23310/","ZlothX","Zloth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZlothX/","116 products in account","Recommended BUT....\n\nThis game is an odd one.  It's a JRPG complete with animal people, teenaged leading character, and a fairly good story once it gets started but it's got a pretty strange combat system.  It supports mouse/keyboard though it could have supported them better.  It also has a tendency to hide pretty important information on how the game works but there's now an excellent Wikia website that will fill you in on all the details you care to learn.\n\nThe combat system is really the make-or-break feature for this game, IMHO, and it's very different from anything I've ever played before or since.  It's turn based but you get to have a lot of characters in your party (up to 18 eventually) so telling each one of them exactly what to would take way too long.  Instead, you divide your team into squads then give general orders to the squad along the lines of "attack with melee" and "stand back and heal" then the members of the squad use their abilities to carry out those orders.\n\nNot all the possible commands appear every round, though.  The game will pick out four or five of them depending on the situation, who the squad's leader is, and other factors.  That will drive some folks crazy but I found it to be a fun part of the game as it forced me to think about what I could still do even though I didn't get to do exactly what I wanted.  It's a bit like being dealt a hand of cards then figuring out what to do with them instead of picking out the best cards from the deck every time.\n\nYou're definitely given a lot of choices in this game.  Simply picking the most expensive commands and attacking whatever is right in front of you with whatever squads you throw together will work OK for a few hours but you'll never make it through the whole game that way.  You're going to need to think about what characters should make up your squads, how many squads you should have, which characters should lead, which characters to hire, which monsters to attack (genocide is NOT the answer), how many to attack at once, whether to send all your squads after one enemy squad or to spread out more, and so on.  You certainly don't need to master every aspect of the game to complete it but you do need to get good at most of them.  (Unfortunately, the game doesn't have a difficulty setting.)\n\nCharacter skill progression is a learn-by-doing system.  If you want Nora casting Cachexia by the end of the game then you'll need to let her do some poison gas spells instead of pounding everything with her hammer.  Character weapons are a major part of progression, too, which are advanced by finding components for your characters to use.  (The Wikia site is extremely handy for that aspect of the game.  Why the developers thought you would actually remember where you found some necrotic metal or which type of critter dropped a mystic fiend horn I have no idea.)\n\nI see a lot of reviews are complaining about grinding... uhh, yeah, you can ignore those.  This is one of the few JRPGs that will actually PUNISH you if you try to exploit the game by grinding!  You see, most JRPGs have fixed monster levels while the characters that get added to your party as you find them automatically adjust to the player's level.  So some people will sit back in the early parts of the game fighting the same monsters over and over until they are so high level that nothing can stop them.  In this game, the characters you find are fixed level but several of the monsters scale to your party's level.  That means the same tactic in this game will result in hiring weak characters against enemies that only a few members in your party can really fight!\n\nThat said, the game CAN turn grindy after you've gotten all the characters you want but it's completely optional.  The game can be completed just fine with no grinding at all.  You won't be able to finish some of the most difficult quests but you won't miss out on any of the story at all.","January 8, 2012","true","517.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Battle Rank (a leveling system that scales up enemy strength the higher your Battle Rank is) is a bit more balanced than it was in the Xbox version, so the penalty for grinding isn't as great. The framerate has been greatly improved, and you are now able to make unions entirely out of general units instead of having to hire the free generic soldiers to fill in gaps, which makes the game much more fun and interesting.\n\nThe story is well written overall, though I wouldn't say that it's the best point of the game. It's interesting, but what really makes the game shine is the combat and the sidequests. There are tons of sidequests to complete and guilds to visit all across the world and the rewards are all genearlly very useful and valuable, ranging from general units to recruit to components to unique weapons. The battle system itself may seem really confusing and complex at first, and then it may seem a bit basic and boring once you get through the first scene, but very quickly it expands and becomes much more exciting and interesting. It is honestly one of my favorite battle systems out of any RPG that I've played.\n\nI'd definitely reccomend this game to anyone who is a fan of JRPGs and intricate battle systems. The game is a blast to play, it has a great soundtrack, and the atmosphere and visuals are amazing.","September 28, 2014","true","64.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I did most of the sidequests and a good number of the guild tasks, and I felt like I was playing forever.  However, that's not necessarily a bad thing (after all, I played Skyrim for the better part of a year...).  Overall, the game is very well-done - interesting plot & characters, decent pacing, beautiful graphics and world design, and an unusual battle system.\n\nThere are a few downsides:\n- I felt like the main character is super annoying.  He's probably supposed to come off as immature, but at times I think they really overdid it.\n- The plot left a lot of unanswered questions, chief among them what the Remnants are and where they came from.\n- Some of the maps are HUGE, and the party's movement speed is just a jog.  So some of the sidequests or even just exploring seems like plain old padding at times.\n- It's kinda annoying that the game has no vsync, so unless you can fix it with your graphics driver, you'll have to get used to lots of tearing.\n- Unless there's something I missed, it looks like you should have 25 slots for active party members, but the most I ever unlocked was 18.  Of course, those 18 were more than enough to make the final battle a curb-stomp.\n- I never quite figured out the formations, especially the "more powerful" versions you get as the game goes on.  My squads were just fine mostly sticking with the early-game formations right up until the end.\n\nI mentioned the battle system above, but I think it's worth going into more detail because I thought it was one of the best things about the game.  It's definitely an interesting change from the standard JRPG format.  The biggest difference is that you don't give orders to your party members directly.  You group them into squads, called "unions", and you give general orders to each squad, like "Attack with mystic arts" or "Keep your HP up", and the squad members take whatever actions they can that fit in with your orders.  It adds an interesting bit of tactics and unpredictability to the fights, especially toward the end when each party member has so many different abilities to choose from.  Except for the main character, the party members also manage their own equipment, so there's not a lot of time spent optimizing each and every one like in some other games.\n\nFinal verdict: if you like JRPGs but you're looking for something a little different from the usual formula, you'll definitely want to check this one out.","December 20, 2015","true","155.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/awdbawl/recommended/23310/","awdbawl","AwdBawl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/awdbawl/","136 products in account","TL;DR -- Story saves the game from the furnace, but everything else assures it stays in the bargain bin. 4/10\n\nI've tried twice now to like this game. The first was years ago on my Xbox, and now on the PC. The story is appealing and involved, but the main character is a cringeworthy blockhead. I understand at the beginning of the game he's meant to be lovably obtuse; a character meant to have room to grow. But it'll leave you gnashing your teeth at his sheer density more often than not.\n\nAdditionally, the game's scaled-down version of Dynasty Warriors it calls a battle system is a hot mess touted as being unique. There are so many things going on at once you're left guessing who's attacking what at any given time. You are encouraged to attack multiple enemies at once due to additional reward drops, but this can be unfair at times. If an NPC-controlled unit contends a player-controlled one, the enemy NPCs usually get a first swing, and rightly so. But I have found, much to my dismay/frustration, that this is STILL the norm even when a player-controlled unit starts a skirmish. Enemies will get to attack you first whether you're on offense/defense, and it has bequeathed me with a Game Over more times than I can count. And if ever you wish to heal your units, you have to break off fighting any enemy units you're currently skirmishing. And you know what that does? You guessed it; it provides the enemy with another chance to attack you.\n\nThe game also suffers from an error many of its predecessors have made: level-scaled enemies. No matter how strong your characters get, you're no stronger comparitively to NPCs than you were at level 1. You just dish out bigger numbers against bigger health pools.\n\nWorse still, if you don't have a character in your party, they will not receive XP. Couple this with scaled enemies, and you will have a very, VERY tough time trying to level-up any neglected party members later in the game.\n\nAnother minor nit-pick is that the camera controls while using a keyboard do not lock while navigating dialogue or game menus. You will often see the camera pan/jitter while moving up/down/left/right through menu screens, and yes this does happen during battle as well. Again, minor annoyance, but it is pervasive, and for this reason I had to complete the game on my Xbox instead (notice the 1.5 game hours on record).\n\nI feel this game's story was a solid pitch, but then poor dialogue and (english) acting, as well as an experimental battle system gone awry have left it collecting dust. It's unfortunate, considering an epic story is only 1/3 of the formula that makes this genre great--the other 2/3 being story delivery and battle system, where this game falls horribly short.\n\nCan't a guy dream for the return of the original turn-based encounter system? Tried and true, it's what put this genre on its feet. What on earth was so wrong with it?

That must have been something because I am still getting my ♥♥♥ kicked just a few hours in at the first serious boss battle. Don't think I'm doing anything obviously wrong either. Given that the game isn't even entirely out of tutorial mode at this point, one might expect a little less of a steep learning curve. As it is, the fun has largely been drained out of it. Some may like it.\n\nThat aside, the game is reasonably pretty. The characters display the usual array of JRPG expressions and personae, which can be an acquired taste. But the dialogue, especially in the english dub I suspect, does not flow at all. Long silences between each line, as if the game was loading a new tape each time. That makes it hard to feel engaged in whatever they are saying.\n\nTherefore overall: decent interface, irritating gameplay difficulty, and forgettable / mildly annoying story development: I'll give this game a pass after all.","February 7, 2015","false","4.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It would be good if I had friends playing online w/ me, as it is much more fun. At £3.19 (approx $4.50-$5 - not sure) this is a brilliant priced title.

I play Nintendo and I like FF and RPG's a lot, and this is one fit for any kind of fan. This is a good game, if you do not want to buy Final Fantasy XIV on steam for £20.00 or FF XII or XIII (which are both 15 years old).

I was mistaken. This game sadly falls into number crunching your party members and hoping for random abilities or battle options to appear before the enemy gets thier opposing random actions or crits. I could be stuck on a battle for an hour and try all kinds of party adjustments, targeting and actions and in the end the battle would only turn out diffrently if i got a critical skill off before the enemy or was lucky enough to press a quick time button in a defense that killed an enemy party instead of just boinking them for 2 damage.\n\nThis game acts like theres some strategy but in the end, battles often just fall down to who crits a few times first or randoms some massive skill in their attack action. Whats to bad is the enemy doesn't need these things nearly as much as you do and the resulting "difficulty" that is associated with this game is nothing more then redoing a battle enough times until you get the magic combination of chances that result in a win.\n\nAlso the main charactor is a 5 year old in a teen body. Brash dumb and whiney dont make for a good main charactor. I can understand if hes supposed to be going through a charactor arc, but this kid is an ANNOYING and thoughtless husk. If your going to do childish to start, give me a Tidus style charactor. Young and naive but with somthing admirable so i dont begin the story by hating him.\n\nDo yourself a favor and avoid this game unless you enjoy rolling dice once every 5 minutes and hoping for double 6's.","December 27, 2014","false","4.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The combat system is unique, leaving unions to choose their specific attacks. This allows the fight to feel more real than having units spam the same move multiple times.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Quelestial/recommended/23310/","Quelestial","Quelestial","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Quelestial/","3 products in account","The Last Remnant is a game I'd recommend, however, only to a certain type of player. In this review I'll try to go over what I liked and what frustrated me, to try and give a clearer picture for those looking to buy.\n\nI should note, I finished with 95 hours played at BR45. This was also completing most of the side quests as well as recruiting all major leaders, I also did a small amount of rare monster hunting.\nI also edited files to give the game a larger FOV and reduced texture pop in, I high recommend doing the same before playing, you can find a guide detailing how here on Steam.\n\nHere's what I liked:\n\nThe graphics, this game looks fantastic. The remnants are wonderful to view and the small areas of the citys you can visit are well detailed (this does not include the bland dungeons).\n\nThe large amount of items, drops and weapons. If resource gathering, crafting and mining is your thing, TLR's got you covered. The game contains tons of different items and components. You can go down many different weapon tree's, crafting better version of each weapons, turning them into more deadly looking tools. There's a fair amount of rare and boss weapon drops in the game too.\n\nThe variation of combat arts and mystic arts. These's are the ability's your characters will learn and perform. There's a huge amount, most look fairly wonderful to watch. It's also nice to assign certain Leader's to specialize in these area's.\n\nThe music. This game has some fantastic music, tracks like Swirling Sands from the Great Sand Sea are a favourite.\n\nThe menu's and IU. It's a fairly important part of an RPG, this game nails it. It's clean, slick and easy to use.\n\nHere's some things I didn't like:\n\nYou can't manually select what a character cast during battle. I see what Square Enix was trying to do here, but it simply ended up with you turn different move's on and off before battle, just so your desired move was forced to come up during battle. It ended up becoming annoying more than anythign else.\n\nWhen you most need a certain command during battle, it won't show. Let's say I only have one Union left, I want to revive my other downed Unions, the game will at times, only give me attack commands rather than showing me something I really need.\n\nPoor character development. Firstly, Rush is out right annoying and the few characters who have likable personalities aren't explored, they're left to occational one liners.\n\nBattle's a boring at first. TLR is a hard game. Until you open up the better moves and are able to create more interesting Unions the battles feel alot like pressing the same button and watching a short cutscene until it's over. Now this changes somewhat later on. Anyone who's played Final Fantasy 13 will understand this very problem.\n\nI would say The Last Remnant is an aquired taste. The more I played it, the better and more interesting it's mechanic's and features got. Anyone who's interested in a challenging JRPG will want to give this a go. If you're looking for something more traditional, this may not be for you.\n\nIf you're unsure my advise would be to YouTube some gameplay videos, flick over the different mechanic's on this game wonderful Wiki.","August 20, 2014","true","96.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If yes proceed to the next question.\nDo you like grinding? If no you can stop here, you might need some patience and time to play this game.\n\nIf you are expecting a A-RPG, do not be fooled this game is not that.\n\nLast remnant is a fantastic JRPG with a novel combat system that feels like a breeze of fresh air in this game industry where every game last 5 hours and is full of cinematics (there are plenty of cinematics in TLR do not fear). The combat system feels random at times until you learn how the system works, problem is this is going to take at least 50h and you are not going to have a grasp of all the things you can actually do. The story is alright, considering the main character is less charismatic than a potato and he is annoying as hell, but a mysterious and charismatic antagonist pays off.\n\nPros:\n\n- Cheap.\n- Loads of content and beautiful areas.\n- Really nice visuals.\n- AoE synergies and group building.\n- Difficulty through the roof, that makes you build up some self confidence when you get to kill THAT ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ MONS-- er.\n- ♥♥♥♥ loads of upgrades to weapons and skills.\n- Customization of your units and characters make the game an experience every time you play it.\n\nCons:\n- Main character annoying as hell.\n- Side quests blocking the full content of the game, especially in some cases when you needed to do a quest from Disc 1 in order to go into a new zone (e.g. The ancient runes.)\n- Guild rewards need you to kill some random monster that has a 0.01% spawn ratio.\n- Almost mandatory to follow a guide during your first playthrough.\n\nVeredict: 7 out of 10.","September 29, 2014","true","97.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

You just don't have COMPLETE control of all your characters so that's annoying.\n-The "zones". Let's take the first town for example. It has a handful of NPCs, then you gotta exit the street to a map view of the city, to go to the next part of the city. You can SEE the next part of the city from the first street but you need to exit to a world map to go to the next part of the town\n-The cutscenes. It's awkward. They talk-pause-walk-pause-talk.

I simply found no entry into this game. The decent in-game video sequences were providing a very japanese RPG feel, and I guess one could view this as mix between RPG and tactical/skirmish combat. However, from the graphics to the controls everything cried out "console port", and IMHO not at very good one at that.\n\nThis may have been a decent console game some years ago, but trying to play this on a PC keyboard was pretty frustrating, the visuals were sometimes a mix between decent and annoying (e.g. not showing your party when moving around, very basic tactical environments), and the "unique" turn-based tactical combat system was pretty lame, IMHO. E.g. no tactical movement of your party members, but just a selection of attack options from a list, "combined" Hit Points for entire groups, etc. Still, there are the typical RPG elements such as character building, item drops, etc., but nothing like crafting, enchanting, etc. known from more complex RPGs (at least not as far as I went into it). There is a strong feeling that this game almost plays itself, and while some may consider it to have a deep or compelling storyline (though not compared to e.g. BG2:SoA I'd say), I just couldn't stand the gameply between the video sequences which seemed mainly about depicting some asian kids saving the world...\n\nThis type of Japanese RPG game with simplified turn-based tactical battles may have it's fans, but I am not among them. If you like JRPGs you may love this one. If, like me, you prefer Divinity 2 or old-school BG2:SoA type RPGs with tons of "fetch this, kill that" type side quests, then this is most probably not for you.\n\nDepth: Immersive (?)\nSetting: Fantasy\nType: RPG/Tactical\nMy Rating: 4 out of 10 (you may rate this 8 of 10 if you are into JRPGs)...","August 16, 2014","false","1.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But it suffers from one major flaw, you don't really play the game. I understand a difficult game I do enjoy a challenge but lets be fair here, challengeing because you had to plan ahead, and challengeing because your luck was bad are two completely different things. One example is an easy first boss fight, that i had to do twelve different times and still could not beat. First of all you may die before you EVEN ENGAGE in the battle because of dumb luck. Second you engage in the battle and whatever order you give may just not play out right for some reason, and you never really know the reason why its just ends up feeling like somebody flipped a coin somewhere and said ♥♥♥♥ it. Then you get lucky and can issue an actual battle order but only for yourself hoping that whatever ally you don't control does what you want it to... Did I mention the fact that you can't really control all your party members, you just issue orders and hope they do what you want. I know this is the way the gameplay was designed but it was a poor design choice because I don't really feel like I am controlling anything. Also I might add that as you level up the enemies get harder, while this seems like a good thing at first, its not... You have a difficult boss fight and want to do some griding to come back later to try to beat him... too bad he is just as hard because he leveled up. Want to do some side quests  just to get away from the main story? well damnit now all the bosses and enemies are harder. This game literally punishes you for doing side quests, yea its that annoying. If you enjoy this game thats fine, more power to you and I am glad you did, but for any newcomers please be wary that this game is extremely convoluted and frustrating.","August 18, 2014","false","4.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

(Game revolves around tactical choices for each squad that determine what actions they will likely take. But, it's better than selecting 18 individual unit actions separately)\n\nCONCLUSION-\nThis game is not for those looking for a traditional JRPG. Similar to the SaGa series, The Last Remnant has no character development or decent plot, and has a different combat and leveling system compared to oldies like Final Fantasy or Breath of Fire. If you've been fishing out SaGa games out of the trash like I have, you may enjoy this game. I however, enjoyed Unlimited SaGa more than this weird game.\n\n\n","May 15, 2015","false","6.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This is a great way for PC gamers to play a turn-based, strategic RPG, which unfortunately, has been a dying genre for the platform since the 90s. I don't like that it eschews a world map (a terrible trend in Japanese RPGs). However, some of the areas are vast enough to give the feel of a world map, even if you are just picking names of places to go. This isn't as good as Final Fantasy XII, the only FF that wasn't garbage after IX, but it gets the job done. The battle system could have offered more control, but it adds a different kind of strategy with who to target, and when to use what commands you are given the option to use. The texture pop-in of the UT3 engine is bad, and the cutscenes look like crap even after forcing v sync with a third-party app, but the towns and the remnants look cool.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NC37/recommended/23310/","NC37","Gilder the Squidslinger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NC37/","253 products in account","Certainly is underrated. Story is alright for a JRPG. Its full of traditional JRPG tropes so not too much new there. The protagonist is a sis-con/etc. However, where it becomes more unique is in party formations. This is like an RPG game with a heavier emphasis on setting up your parties to handle all threats. It is a different and welcome approach. Because of this, some fights can be much harder than they need be.\n\nYou'll likely find lots of people complaining about the difficulty. But here is probably the greatest tip of all and it didn't take much to figure out. Yes some are hard, but they all have optimal strategies to make them work. It isn't luck of the draw. Luck only comes in when it comes to damage/resist totals. Overall instead of simple luck, it usually involves who you target first. If you are having trouble, try other combinations. I've had some tough ones become insanely easy because instead of focusing down one enemy, I focused another. Or instead of splitting up, I focused.\n\nThe other big factor for this game is do a search on it for how to manually set the graphics/etc. Square - Enix did a pretty poor job. But there are wikis out there which will quickly tell you how to set the game up to look much better. It literally is a must do for anyone who buys this game. Read the sites, hack the ini, enjoy the game.\n\nIt is a shame this title didn't get more refinement or better support from Square. Certainly is one of the more unique JRPGs out there. Play it in the Japanese dub if possible. The mannerisms and voices match much better. However, the English subs are sometimes grossly off the mark. If you know any Japanese, you'll notice right away when you come to a scene and wonder who translated it because what they are saying and what the text reads is not close.","July 21, 2014","true","50.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/oversitting/recommended/23310/","oversitting","マホ~","http://steamcommunity.com/id/oversitting/","275 products in account","This game repeadily screws with you until you no longer want to play it. Doing side quests and grinding makes the game harder due to level scailing to the point where I can no longer progress because I never bother learning all the little intricacies of gearing every character in your party and leading the party members into the right skills. Since you can't manually do any of it, you'd never know what you were doing if you don't use a wiki, which I didn't which is why I got screwed. Why you can'd just equipe your party normally is beyond me. Pretty much everything is a chore to do since you can only tell a party member to focus on something and then they need to take gear from your inventory when they want it, at random. This wouldn't be so bad if the game wasn't so difficult because of the combat system.\n\nThe combat system is terrible. You can't tell your party to do anything you want, It's all decided by RNG. Every turn it's 3 options of attack the enemy, which all do pretty much the same thing unless you have the wiki open and know exactly what is useful against what enemies. Then you do the QTEs to win which if you miss you you lose most of your damage. Some times randomly maybe you get an option to heal which is always nice to have but they don't always give it to you when you need it. It's infuriating to be fiting a hard enemy for 20 minutes of attrition and then they just don't let you heal for a turn and you lose. WTF GAME?  You can't even defend and stand still because standing still means you lose all your morale if you get attacked, they punish you for not attacking. Positioning is next to impossible since you can't choose to move, only to attack someone and choosing to stand still is asking to lose if there is any enemies that aren't locked in combat. Attacking with multiple unions on a boss is also terrible a lot of the time since bosses get to attack every union that attack them. Which means they can hit you with AOEs more option.\n\nThe bosses will repeatedly do AOEs which can wipe a union in 1 hit and they can hit all unions in range. So since you can't move, you are at the mercy of the boss RNG of chosing to do the AOEs and how many of your units are in range because that is all controlled by RNG. I can't imagine how they expect people to approach the battle strategically when they give you no options in the battle. Every boss battle feels like flipping a coin because you need to dodge some AOEs or you'd lose. There is no other way arround it. The AOEs will 1 hit KO a full union if they hit.\n\nOverall, the game just isn't for me and it pisses me off so much that it made my write this review. Mainly because I played more than 40 hours of it and I can't even progress any more. I am now stuck unless I want to cheat or something. I saved accidentally at a part I can't progress pass because the boss is too hard and I can't even leave because the game locks me from leaving the area until I beat said boss.\n\nI actually enjoyed the idea of controlling a large group of units in an army like this but this game feels like it just want to screw with me every chance it gets. There is no logic to the combat system at times and it is all a long gind. Even with all that I would have been happy if I just got to the of the game but the game won't even give me that.","February 27","false","46.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You'll get a quest, cheese through the trash creatures and then be faced with an impossible boss that forces you to ditch the quest. Though the 'rare' creatures are optional I like to take them on at the time of encountering them, and there in lies the issue. You encounter ridiculously strong random rare creatures in dungeons which can obliterate a union (a group unit) in 1 attack round. And in many cases that attack is also AoE and takes the majority HP of another union nearby.\n\nTheres a 'flanking' system in the game where if more than one of your 'unions' attacks the same creature you get a damage bonus. Great right? However, every boss and rare can take on multiple of your unions without ever getting flanked because they can do something called 'multi deadlock' which then also allows them to attack multiple times in a single round. And if that creature decides to do it's big attack twice in the same turn kiss your a** goodbye.\n\nYour party members get new abilities along the way, which is nice. But the game picks 4-6 cookie cutter attack patterns based on health, AP, etc. I ended up grouping Rush with Torgal, but because Torgal's combat arts were so strong the game never gave me an option to ever use Rush's combat abilities unless I had built up a ridiculous amount of AP.\n\nThere's a morale indicator in each battle. Who knows why. You either handlily destroy your enemies and it's all the way to one side, or you take a bad hit and watch it go completely in the enemies favor at which point it ain't never coming back.\n\nSpeaking of useless things there's also a minimap in each battle that shows you the location of every union. But even if you set your unions to attack the closest enemy unions somehow there are still interferences and interceptions. Which makes absolutely no sense how the game judges distances and deadlocks. This part is particularrly annoying because you can send your best union against a larger enemy union, but then the game randomly decides that another enemy union of 1 NPC interceps that union, and then you basically lose 3 of your most powerful attacks for the round.\n\nOverall, if the fights weren't completely one-sided 99% of the time it might be worth continuing. But as is I either destroy the trash NPCs, or get completely blown out by a boss/rare. So overall it's just not a fun game.","December 23, 2015","false","25.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

But the rest of this game makes me run away as soon as I try to play it.\n\nDidn't see that much of the story, or at least i hope so. So maybe the story is decent but the gameplay kept me from it.\n\nNow i start with what really makes this game the worst JRPG i've ever seen.\n1. The characters : The main Character Rush is a dumb, hotheaded but far to talented kid who just doesn't think about any consequence his actions could have. Too often I was sitting there watching him rush(no pun intended) into dangerous situation and i was left with one big question : WHY?!\nThe cast of other characters makes even less sense. Rush meets them and after less than two lines of dialog : "I'm gonna help you." Again same question... WHY?! These characters never met before and just exchanged less words, than Hodor from Game of Thrones has in his entire repertoire, and they are acting like BFFs?!\n\n2.The character growth system: The game punishes you for ending your fights as fast and efficient as possible. As your character's hp don't grow if the they don't get damaged. This learning by doing stuff was allready bad in one of the older Final Fantasys back on the SNES. And that's not wine, it doesn't get better with age.\n\n3.The battle system/battle rank system/enemy scaling : The Battle system itself seems interesting at first glance.Especially the Unit-Formation-Leader stuff really has a lot of interesting and strong points. But then the atrocities begin. The Battle system itself is a lot of random, luck reliant stuff. Which is never good in a turnbased game.\nYou get no indication which Unit moves when, you have no Idea of the enemy's speed. And you get no information on the enemy's movents at all. How is any human beeing supposed to formulate a strategy without even the most basic of information provided? How am I supposed to keep my morale up if the enemy Interferes with any of my moves?\n\nYour party strength plays no part in the enemy scaling to your party at all. As you fight more enemys, what you sometimes have to do, your battle rank rises. The higher your battle rank, the stronger the monsters. That system is supposed to balance itself out. But I tell you one thing: It doesn't because at some point enemys will start using Area of Effect Attacks which damage your Unitmembers Individually this is going to oneshot whole Units, at some occasions even the whole Army, as happened to me several times. making fighting impossible because there is no flee option. Then there are these Special Arts that some characters have. They can use them if a gauge on the Status screen of the Unit is filled. These gauges fill as you attack, and drop as you take damage. So these Special Arts are supposed to give you an even greater edge when you are allready dominating the fight. But anything like a strong "last resort" type of attack would maybe make many fights less frustrating.\n\nSo I would not recommend this game, even if I would get paid for that.","September 2, 2015","false","16.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Square treats the consumer as if they are mentally challenged, and it's clear with this game.\n\nWhy is the player unable to equip other party members? Why are they forced into classes that don't even sound neat or interesting? Why were so many monster sprites reused so much? Why are rare monsters so freaking hard? Why is the player formations limited to 18 characters when you have 4 unions that can hold up to 20 characters?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kentlang/recommended/23310/","kentlang","Protesting Guy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kentlang/","230 products in account","Disclaimber: This review was written 11/09/2010\n\nThe Last Remnant is about a kid who's sister become kidnapped and he ventures on a journey to save her. The game is mainly marketed of it's "strategic" combat system where you can flank, intercept and such while still being a "faithful" JRPG.\n\nWhen you start up the game you are greeted with awesome music and some really sweet battles and I love large battles. It gives me chills in all the Total War games, but this game is nothing like Total War. The graphics use the unreal engine are alright (when it gets going), although this game is especially slow on loading textures in relatively small areas, which will mean that you're going to watch a lot of low-res textures (this might be fixed by defraging the hard drive though). The art style is a joke. If you didn't like Final Fantasy IX for it's art style you're going to hate this game because it's inhabited by giant fish people, small rabbit-frogs and orcs... no wait, those are just guards. All especially bred to be as cartoony as possible. The main characters are ridiculously emo-looking, and I mean all the main characters, which is why this style needs to die, right now.\n\nThe biggest problem with this game however is the combat system. It sucks ♥♥♥ because it has nothing to do with strategy. Since it uses turns you cannot in reality intercept someone because you never know who they're trying to go after. You "flank" your opponents by sending more than one unit towards them, if you're opponent is then fighting more than one squad in the same time you'll flank them and this is regardless of squad size so 1 squad vs 2 squads equals flank but the nice thing is that the squad can be surrounded and that happens when they're fighting over 3-4 enemies I believe. When the fighting starts it only looks like a giant brawl without any kind of structure, and since the game deals with relatively low numbers of units it wont look as epic as the brawls in the Total War series where they're mostly chaotic because here the characters take turns to hit each other. You get 3 squads in which you can have max 5 people in them it's kinda strange that they would even be able to flank someone and quite fitting it all turns into a brawl. Your performance of the battles are entirely luck based because you never really directly command your units in battle. If you want them to heal themselves you gotta wait until they're bleeding to death before the option is even available. I thought this didn't sound so bad before I bought the game but in practice it ruins the "tactics element" of it all, if you could call it that.\n\nSo basically you can't flank your opponents if you don't outnumber them and you cannot directly control your squadmates. This is a game where the player doesn't have much control over and you would probably have better control when trying to win at ♥♥♥♥ing slot machines! The control you do have is where to send your squads, vague pointers on how they should fight and who goes in what squad. Oh and by the way, you don't get to choose their equipment either. Poof, now a RPG element are gone too.\n\nDo I even have to say more? The story mayhap? When you meet (what the ♥♥♥♥ his name was) you befriend him and the story turns over to him for a moment while he tries to make his vassal state independent from another vassal state. Yes, this game deals in Feudalism (kind of) and you get to follow his struggle for his state's independence for a little while. He promises you that he will find your sister in the process but it have to be done methodically. The story isn't half bad I think and it would be really interesting to follow up on if only the game actually let you control the battles. It becomes increasingly difficult to control the outcome of the battles and you would probably lose quite a few battles because you simply cannot control anything that's happening during the course of it.\n\nDecent story and graphics, poor characters and art style and a bad gameplay. If you could control the game it would be alright but a game that cannot interact with the player isn't worth spending many hours of frustration on. And don't even get me started on the giant learning curve, why is it so big? Because no one tells you squat and the game is so unorthodox in almost every way. There's a stat that is different for each character that seems more like a characteristic. It changes with levels but what does it do? No, this game is hopelessly bad, don't even try it.","December 5, 2013","false","76.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

The Last Remnant would tell you otherwise. Story gives a generic "adventure for x objective", without character development. Grapics are decent for running on an Unreal engine. However, gameplay is lackluster and doesn't deserve good praise. It has you controlling multiple "teams" while not giving you individual character control in case of needed emergencies. If one character on a team does an action based on your decision, they ALL have to act in that manner. The big problem is that whenever you think the battle is over, more enemies come in to extend the pointless auto-battle. Get a Final Fantasy title, or any other JRPG that can give you better character development.","March 29, 2014","false","0.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Combat itself in the game is terrible, you choose from a set of skills that you know almost nothing about. As for the game explaining things, it will have tutorial pop-ups every time it invents a new phrase for the game to let you know how the battle is going, it doesn’t however explain how chests work and whether you can receive all the loot or only one. It doesn’t let you know how strong an enemy is till you fight it. There are uncommon monsters that if you fight them and die that monster then you can never encounter that monster again. (that specific monster, not that type of monster) There are lots of items that you can find in monsters corpses but the game makes it very difficult to know what any of the items do other than be sold to merchants for coins. The game controls are terrible, it looks like it was made for xbox but then was never finished being integrated into PC controls. The game has the 3rd person viewpoint camera barely move around on its own, and the only other way to control the camera is with arrow-keys. The game didn’t take the time to configure the mouse to be bound to anything, which is a waste of potential camera control. When you want to engage an enemy while getting initiative (slight damage bonus) you have to press 3 different keys! you have to press F or G to get your character to look at them, V to be ready for battle, then SPACEBAR to start the battle. The English and the Japanese dialog was poorly written; the English has the character constantly speak is phrases that seem irrelevant. The plot and character development was poor; the main characters see a winged beast at the beginning and the sister is kidnapped, but when they saw the enemy in that scene they realized it was hostile, then proceeded to calmly wait for the enemy to fly over and attack. After this you end up on a plain with 2 armys charging each other for no reason... then you meet a prince who agrees to help you recover your sister, but then just sits on the throne and provides info. There was also technical incongruities, such as the necklace that the main character wears around his neck disappears randomly from time to time. (this isn’t a glitch, its also not in cut scenes)\n\nPositives:\n-has Japanese as a dialog option\n-has relatively original plot (for better or for worse)\n-has appropriate background music...\n-has Kingdom Hearts quality of graphics","January 9, 2014","false","2.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Some BIG monsters can AOE multiple unions and erase your party in a single spell... and they will cast it FREQUENTLY.\n-You can't surrender, so if you're trying to beat a very strong rare enemy and it destroys half or your units on the first turn... you must watch the other half die, sometimes very slowly.\n-You CAN'T skip cutscenes. After some cutscenes you will be immediately thrown into battle, and if you lose it... load your save and watch 5+ min cutscene again.\n-You can equip only your main protagonist, others can only request some components and RARELY items from your inventory, so you can sit on a pile of top gear and no ability to use it. It's not a huge minus anyway, cause all you have is main/offhand weapon and 2 accessory slots.\n-Though locations are pretty unique and well done you will be forced to visit them over and over again if you want to complete sidequests or hunt for rare monsters for the guild. Every quest teleports you to corresponding location and teleports back to tavern IMMEDIATELY after it's completion.\n-The world and lore are really interesting, but the story feels like it's written for the 12 y/o. This "flaw" can be seen in almost every Japanese game (atleast in my experience) and can be forgiven.\n-Battle system is pretty good for a JRPG, but it's very annoying that you can't skip battles with weak monsters when revisiting old locations.\nI'd give it 6/10, but put a huge red FRUSTRATION WARNING on it.","November 9, 2014","true","96.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

After 20 hours of play, I reached a point where I could not proceed anymore because of a boss that I was under leveled for.  Yeah yeah yeah, I could have used multiple save files, but the game really shouldn't let you steam roll through a dungeon only to have the boss be insurmountable.  Furthermore, if said boss is impossible, there should be minions to grind on in the vicinity, allowing the player an opportunity to grind and proceed.  This game basically locked me in a room with no way out, and because I didn't save outside of this area, I simply can't proceed.  You can argue it's partially my fault, and that's fair, but it is still very bad game design.  It's really ashamed because the story and graphics are actually quite good, and the battle system has some merits.  That said, I will still not be trekking back through to make up my lost progress.  Unless you are going to play this game using a guide or a wiki, don't bother with it.","February 22, 2015","false","24.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Let me elaborate. You are advancing in the story. You just unlocked a new place to visit. But wait! If you do not re-visit the previously visited stories and kill every single enemy 3 times, you are not going to have a chance against the enemies in the new area!\nWhat is that? You just did that and are no longer having problems with fighting enemies in the new area, even if you aggro 5 groups at a time?\nI guess that means you can go fight the boss, right? Whoops, he instakilled you because your level is too low. If you exit the area and clear all its enemies 3 more times, the boss will actually only deal about half as much damage! That works every time!\nCoincidentally, the only parts that are not grindy or fetch-quests are essentially the tutorials and early side-quests, because they automatically teleport you to the area you are goign to, initiate the thing you are supposed to do, and teleport you back to the quest NPC to give you a reward, all automatically. Which is not really that good at teaching you anything, but at least you do not have to grind.\n\nControl\nEvery action you have in a fight will have a pre-determined combination of actions, depending on how many action points you have. Half the time, there is no option for ranged attacks, even if you are able to do them. When you are healing yourself with white majykks, all non-healers will stand by. If you use the option that allows you to attack AND heal, your characters will prioritize using items, unless they have no item skills, even if their magic is stronger. If you let them play by ear, which is supposed to let each character in a squad attack the way they want to, they'll just auto-attack without using skills most of the time, even if you have 100+ AP and their skills cost 7.\n\nManagement\nThe only way you can customize any character except the MC (Rush Sykes) is by deciding whether you will let them take your loot to upgrade their weapons or not. Other than that, you can only tug them in the right direction by spamming commands that will increase a certain skill or attribute if used a lot, but that will unbalance your entire party and make them less efficient, since Legions normally have a mix of melee and caster characters.\n\nThe rest of my points speak for themselves.\n\n\n","February 19, 2015","false","6.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This game however got to a point that it was unwinable. The console version was apparently too easy so they ramped up the difficulty scaling on the pc version, which they overdid. Im still interested in the story, i just got to the point where i couldnt kill anything, and to fix it i would have to scrap my save and start again. Ill elaborate though... there are no levels in this game, your main character just gets ranks which are like level ups where you get random points based on what you killed. HOWEVER the game tricks you into thinking you can just fight large groups of enemies to get a larger reward, what it really means is to ONLY fight the tough enemies, otherwise when you rank up you get points based on the weak enemies, which is to say you barely get stat increases but the enemies get tougher. Rank up enough this way and the game becomes unwinnable. I only found out what i was doing wrong about half way into the game and the only way to correct it is to start from the beginnning again. I couldnt do any of the sidequests to beat elite enemies because they often just one shotted me. That said the correct way of playing this game is to pick up the strongest allies, avoid every enemy you can and only fight bosses or elite enemies as part of sidequests to keep your rank down as low as it can go. This game greatly discourages revisiting areas and grinding (such as farming the parts to craft a good weapon). I may someday return to this game in an attempt to beat it, but having to restart because i farmed too much seems like a bad gameplay design.","May 27, 2014","false","34.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

JRPG ala final fantasy buatan square enix yang diport untuk xbox360 dan PC windows. Sebelum Final Fantasy XIII dirilis untuk PC, mungkin The Last Remnant adalah satu-satunya JRPG dengan grafis modern di PC.\n\nCerita (7/10)\nBiarpun mungkin terlihat sederhana, namun cerita TLR sebenarnya cukup rumit bila kita memainkan semua side quest yang diberikan. Seperti asal usul suatu tempat dan runtuhnya kerajaan kuno. Semuanya diberikan sepotong-sepotong. Kalau kita hanya mengikuti alur cerita mungkin akan terasa banyak lubang di cerita ini.\n\nGameplay (8/10)\nGameplay TLR sangat unik. Tidak hanya 3-4 karakter yang bisa jadi anggota party kita tapi sampai 18 karakter! Eksekusinya cukup mudah berdasarkan union yang terdiri hingga 5 karakter. Kita bisa mengelompokkan union mana yang melakukan combat art (serangan fisik), mystic art (serangan mystic) support atau healing. Penggunaan formasi juga berpengaruh dalam menghadapi boss tertentu.\n\nGrafis (4/10)\nSIsi grafis cukup menyedihkan. Dunia dalam TLR sebenarnya sangat indah dan detail, sayang sekali penggunaan Unreal Engine tidak maksimal. Hal paling menyedihkan adalah saat pindah scene ada jeda 2-3 detik untuk loading texture.

It has a different (and maybe difficult at the beginning) battle system, but once you learn, you will undertand how good and complex it is. The story is ok and you cannot fully control the game mechanics, for example some of your characters may choose an unwanted path and craft/equip weapons that will change the Union strategy. But this is a JRPG that tried to innovate, and in my opinion, it succeeded!\nWell, I had lots of fun playing this version and the console version(Which is a bad version, the PC port is way superior).\n\nOh yeah, and I loved the soundtrack.

I did not enjoy this game at all.\n\nThis is very much a game that you NEED (and I honestly mean that it is required) to read a how-to-play guide before you ever get started. Partly because the party/control/gameplay system is ridiculously convoluted at first, but also because there are inherently backwards gameplay things you absolutely need to know before you start.\n\nFor example, battle rank (BR). BR is basically determined by how many enemies you kill. It's not like EXP though, from what I understand, because (from what I've read) it more or less keeps track of the number of times you enter combat, and not anything related to the toughness of the monsters you kill. You want to keep BR as low as possible, since your characters get better stat increases at low BR, and the enemies will scale with you, potentially even causing you to be out-leveled at later stages in the game.\n\nThis is idiotic. Why the flaming crap do they fill areas chock-full of enemies that you can beat, and then say "Nuh-uh, you'll regret it later" and "You're doing the smart thing and attacking enemies one at a time!? HOW DARE YOU, NOW YOU MUST SUFFER!" Plus, this is not explained to you at all. Of course, neither is 98% of the rest of the game.\n\nThe combat is weird, and strangely hard to follow. You will assign your unions (squads of units) to attack certain other enemies, but when the attack round starts, the unions run at each other in this pre-scripted "action" scene that makes it really hard to mentally place where they are actually running to. It's hard to explain, but immediately noticeable. Honestly, this game would be way better if they cut out the cinematic crap and just gave you a flat overhead view of the battle.\n\nNot a fan. I played it for maybe 10 hours, and was lost and frustrated for 10.6 of them. This game has no direction, no tutorials, and completely illogical gameplay mechanics.

It manages to have some of the greatest voices on the face of the planet and still manages to fall short due to its writing.  The main character is voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch, so you'd think he'd be able to save the performance, right?  Nope, the writing's that dry and cliched...though moreso the former than the latter.\n\nWhat does make this game worth recommending, however, is the gameplay.  When I say that the title is unique, I don't mean because of the writing; games have had great voices and bad writing before.  What makes this game unique is that it has a style of gameplay unseen since Chaos World back on the NES.  Rather than controlling one character at a time and fighting monsters that way, you take several characters into a fight and control them as squads.  This isn't a Turn-Based game, either, though it may look it...or not.  This game is the type of thing that is hard to decipher from videos alone, but its more of a Tactical Turn-Based RPG, though I wouldn't go as far as to call it a Strategy RPG.\n\nThis game also lends itself to an OK story, but there's enough here to keep one who is having fun interested for a while.  The areas are large and open (and this is not a linear game), the customization is one of the more unique things I've seen out of an RPG, and the character recruitment process is slightly unpolished, among other things in the game, but the idea of having so many optional characters with histories and personalities is a nice touch.  If the price is low enough (and this game can go pretty low, price-wise) then I'd definitely recommend checking it out, especially if your looking for a unique experience.","March 25, 2013","true","14.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

From its "union" based combat and the two way morale system and the semi auto skill execution and the "critical timing", there are many things in the game that feels special compare to other games out there.\n\nThe most prominent aspect is the union group system, where you assign characters into a squad and have their HP combined to one unit. You can have up to 18 characters in up to 5 unions with up to 5 cahracters each. This sounds generic although quite unheard of in an RPG, until you get to the formation system, where each placement has different bonuses (and weakpoints) so where your squad stands can matter, and the bonuses can actually increase if the "right" type of character stands on the right spot. The formation system is properly trick and is one of the most complex out there and most players won't even bother learning it, but those that do will have an easier time, as certain formations, besides the bonuses, also features different style of placement that can really help against certain AOE spells.\n\nThere are typically two types of RPG, those that don't need movement to attack (old FF style), and those that has a battlefield and grids where units battle. This game sits in the middle, or rather sits in neither. Unions move automatically to attack enemy groups, so initially you assume that it is essentially a 3D version of FF's style, until one fine day you notice a "too far away" or "move towards the enemy" and be brutally awaken to the fact that there is a real sense of range. Although the game handles movement automatically, there is real strategy involved in WHEN you move, as most enemies (and your squads) can only engage one group at a time, and selecting an enemy to attack involves real battlefield senses, as in is there a clear path and is the enemy too far away that you risk being attacked by another nearer enemy. To intercept (and be intercept) is all part of the game.\n\nSo is morale. This game's morale system is pretty drastic and can turn the tide by as much as a mind boggling 400%, so its safe to say that morale management is key to every battle, no matter how strong your unions are (or how strong the enemies are). Even if your unions are weak, if you manage to have high morale, you can hold your own against seemingly impossible enemies, like fighting dragons early game.\n\nAt first glance, fighting seem pretty normal in itself, with each character attacking one at a time, until all of a sudden a "quick time event" comes up and you're caught off guard. If you played Assassin's Creed 3, you'll note the similarities, only this is much harder as the timing much be exact. Successful timing upon evade will result in a counter much stronger than usual, while successful timing upon parry will stun the enemy. Seems easy enough, until you realise that if you're successful the first time, all the characters in the union that attack afterwards all earned a quick time event as well, so you're caught off guard again, until the first time you did a successful chain and witness the final character in the chain gaining an unavoidable +500% critical attack. No other RPG gets even close to this.\n\nSure, you're thinking that having 18 characters in an RPG, this should be properly easy right? Except that the enemy side can have up to 50 in one long, multi stage, large scale battle, and in most cases, enemies can heal as well. Large battles like this gets properly intoxicating as you witness your support group gets ganged by 3 enemy squads, or you managed to gang up on an enemy squad who just decimated yours, or you managed to slaughter 3 groups with one well placed spell, or you endured and endured the relentless bombardment from 7 enemy squads until you managed to activate your battlefield-decimating skill and watch the resulting destruction. Again, no other RPG gets close to this.\n\nSure, it's not perfect, for example the class system, which the game auto-selects, is quite mind-numbing if you want some control of it (trying to get the class you want is never easy). Fortunately, the class system is purely bonus based and doesn't affect the skills you can use, although each character you can hire has different skills. The story isn't anything special and the game isn't exactly "open world" so the world map isn't explorable. Leveling up your skills can take some micromanaging too as the game auto selects what skill your character uses depending on the circumstances (again, unheard of in an RPG), but you can restrict what it can select by disabling skills.\n\nThis game has a charm that's not found in any RPG to date, and i suspect ever. It's a future classic, and certainly a must have.","December 20, 2014","true","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Probably at least 100 hours to finish everything, but the constant re-use of dugneons and areas fosters a "why bother?" kind of attitude.\n\nThe writing and story fall dead center into the average of what you'd expect from a smaller-budget JRPG -- it poaches and steals from every trope you can imagine, leaving no stone unmolested. Even the moldiest old concept is trotted out a few dozen times throughout the storyline. So if you've seen and liked it in a JRPG before, you'll probably see it again in The Last Remnant, just this time in a worn-out-STD-infected-completely-trashy kind of way,\n\nIn some ways this game makes me want to hire a skywriter to tour Japan and paint the heavens with a simple message: "<Blank> did <insert bad thing> to my <blank> is NOT AN ACCEPTABLE STORY." Because somehow, even in 2008, Square Enix appeared to believe that their customers could be hoodwinked into giving hafl a damn about some characaracter whom we were just introduced to 2 seconds ago, and the bad thing that happened to her. If you find this kind of lazy writing to be offputting, I implore you: stop reading right now, back out of this game's store page, and never let its pixels illuminate your screen again.\n\nThe art direction is okay, and the graphcis are decent for a game first released fairly early in the Xbox 360's lifespan. It runs well on a modern PC. If you hate the way Unreal Engine 3 games look, you'll probably hate the way this game looks.\n\nThe combat system is fairly atrocious. It wants to look complex, but anyone with half a brain can figure the ins-and-outs within a short period of time and turn the game into a mindless slog from start to finish.\n\nAlso, 52353253242345 unwanted fights while backtracking. And believe me, there's some backtracking in this game.\n\nI freely admit that I didn't beat this game. I actually enjoyed it a lot of the time, and might finish it one day. But that's just because I'm into this terrible-but-enjoyable kind of game.\n\nRecommended to hardcore must-play-everything gamers, serious JRPG fans, and the mentally disturbed.","October 10, 2013","true","52.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Probably at least 100 hours to finish everything, but the constant re-use of dugneons and areas fosters a "why bother?" kind of attitude.\n\nThe writing and story fall dead center into the average of what you'd expect from a smaller-budget JRPG -- it poaches and steals from every trope you can imagine, leaving no stone unmolested. Even the moldiest old concept is trotted out a few dozen times throughout the storyline. So if you've seen and liked it in a JRPG before, you'll probably see it again in The Last Remnant, just this time in a worn-out-STD-infected-completely-trashy kind of way,\n\nIn some ways this game makes me want to hire a skywriter to tour Japan and paint the heavens with a simple message: "<Blank> did <insert bad thing> to my <blank> is NOT AN ACCEPTABLE STORY." Because somehow, even in 2008, Square Enix appeared to believe that their customers could be hoodwinked into giving hafl a damn about some characaracter whom we were just introduced to 2 seconds ago, and the bad thing that happened to her. If you find this kind of lazy writing to be offputting, I implore you: stop reading right now, back out of this game's store page, and never let its pixels illuminate your screen again.\n\nThe art direction is okay, and the graphcis are decent for a game first released fairly early in the Xbox 360's lifespan. It runs well on a modern PC. If you hate the way Unreal Engine 3 games look, you'll probably hate the way this game looks.\n\nThe combat system is fairly atrocious. It wants to look complex, but anyone with half a brain can figure the ins-and-outs within a short period of time and turn the game into a mindless slog from start to finish.\n\nAlso, 52353253242345 unwanted fights while backtracking. And believe me, there's some backtracking in this game.\n\nI freely admit that I didn't beat this game. I actually enjoyed it a lot of the time, and might finish it one day. But that's just because I'm into this terrible-but-enjoyable kind of game.\n\nRecommended to hardcore must-play-everything gamers, serious JRPG fans, and the mentally disturbed.","October 10, 2013","true","52.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/machomuu/recommended/23310/","machomuu","machomuu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/machomuu/","915 products in account","The Last Remnant is a unique title.  It manages to have some of the greatest voices on the face of the planet and still manages to fall short due to its writing.  The main character is voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch, so you'd think he'd be able to save the performance, right?  Nope, the writing's that dry and cliched...though moreso the former than the latter.\n\nWhat does make this game worth recommending, however, is the gameplay.  When I say that the title is unique, I don't mean because of the writing; games have had great voices and bad writing before.  What makes this game unique is that it has a style of gameplay unseen since Chaos World back on the NES.  Rather than controlling one character at a time and fighting monsters that way, you take several characters into a fight and control them as squads.  This isn't a Turn-Based game, either, though it may look it...or not.  This game is the type of thing that is hard to decipher from videos alone, but its more of a Tactical Turn-Based RPG, though I wouldn't go as far as to call it a Strategy RPG.\n\nThis game also lends itself to an OK story, but there's enough here to keep one who is having fun interested for a while.  The areas are large and open (and this is not a linear game), the customization is one of the more unique things I've seen out of an RPG, and the character recruitment process is slightly unpolished, among other things in the game, but the idea of having so many optional characters with histories and personalities is a nice touch.  If the price is low enough (and this game can go pretty low, price-wise) then I'd definitely recommend checking it out, especially if your looking for a unique experience.","March 25, 2013","true","14.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

First, the main character is simply obnoxious. Second, where the game informs you of some basics, it does little to explain much of its mechanics. This makes the depth occassionaly impenetrable and more of a liability than an attraction as you may be left wondering why certain abilities are available in some situation but not other or what the various special effects mean.","March 6, 2015","true","74.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Forgettable sidekicks/companions, expect for a few, particularly Dave, he really reminds me of King Cailan, from Dragon Age, and i'm glad he didn't die, in some "epic" plot twist.\nCheating. Yup, i said it. The game cheats. I don't have a problem with a tough challange, but i hate when a game is either buged, or so ridiculously keen on punishing you, that it resorts to dirty tricks.\nSome say this game is like Dark Souls. But that game requires skill, this heavily relies on luck, not skill, or tactical foresight.\nRepetitive luck-based battle system, backed by repetitive music, and aimless wandering around the map, to connect all of this.\nAfter some point, i realized, the only reason i start this game up, is because i want to be done with it as fast as possible. I rushed and exploited my way through half of the game, to be done with it.\nWould i start a new game+? No. Why would i? To grind through the same linear story, and risk the possibility of a brain aneurysm? No thank you.\nYou might have more luck with this game, than i had, but i definitely recommend reading a few guides before starting.\nSo go ahead, the beautiful scenery, and climactic ending, might be worth the hussle.\n\n5/10","April 18","true","26.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I am a big fan of square enix and of the games produced by them. When I saw this title on steam, i thought 'ah, cool. An rpg by one of my favorite video game companies.'\n\nAfter playing for about two hours, my initial reaction was completely turned around. While the game does have 3d animation comparable to the time it was produced, the remainder of the game is sub-par from what I have seen of other titles by square enix.\n\nThe battle system is extremely boring and repetative. While it is easy to learn, it doesn't make sense. Instead of controlling a single character or issuing commands to multiple characters, you issue orders to squads, or "unions" as they are called in the game. And the types of commands are limited to the circumstances of the battle, but are limited to [basic attack], [special attack], [magical attack] and even more rarely [heal]. Once you give the orders, the characters are pretty much left to their own devices, attacking whichever creature they so choose and in whatever fashion they want, which can and has in my case not gone in favor of a winning battle. Not being able to plan and strategize a battle plan with all your characters makes fights far more difficult than they should be, given all that you can input in the commands.\n\nI could have seen past the battle system if the storyline and/or voice acting/dialogue were good. Sadly, that was not the case either. I felt like I was watching a really poorly written anime. The main character, who is perhaps 15, I am guessing, meets an important nobleman and suddenly becomes part of the army, fighting shoulder to shoulder with top level generals and no one raises a fuss. The characters seemed very stiff, almost no emotion going into the dialogue. The bad guys are easily spotted and are cliche'.\n\nOverall, I am dissappointed in this title.","June 4","false","18.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That having been said, if you do decide to give the game a shot, the terrible acting does let up a bit after you get about 10 hours into the main quest side of the game, and the story starts to pick up a bit even if it still follows many of the standard JRPG clichés.\n\nGameplay-wise, The Last Remnant is very ‘hands-off’. The party system mechanics are actually rather interesting, allowing you to recruit members to add to your party and split them up into groups for combat, but it falls short due to the fact that you have no control over those recruits equipment or skills. Gaining new skills requires that a previous skill in the same ‘tree’ is used in combat to give a chance for a new skill to be learned or an old one to be upgraded but even that is left up to a modicum of randomness, unfortunately making the entire system an endeavor of patience and repetition.\n\nThe battle system is likely where you will either learn to love the game despite itself or simply hate it enough to give up entirely. To put it simply, you have almost no control whatsoever. Instead you are given a series of choices based on various factors, such as party/enemy levels, active party skills, party/enemy/ally HP, etc. It is possible to lean the options in a certain direction by disabling non-useful abilities before entering combat so that they are not available as a choice, but even then you may still get turns where your mage-only group is given only physically offensive options.\n\nOnce you get far enough to have 3 groups battles become a bit easier to handle. If you manage to stick around long enough to get to 4 groups, however, the combat system starts to shine a bit, adding in more potential tactics and a better balance for the battles. It’s really at this point that both the gameplay and the story start to pick up and become more fluid all around.\n\nI personally have enjoyed my time playing The Last Remnant, but I went into it fully expecting it to be severely lacking in some areas, and as such will be the first to admit that it is not for everyone. It takes a long time to actually get to the fun parts of the game, but once you’re there it’s… well, fun.\n\nIt’s not epic or life changing, but if you want to play a JRPG that’s a bit different and have the patience to make this one work, then keep a look-out for when it goes on sale and give it a shot. Otherwise, you will most likely be better off passing this one up.\n","December 26, 2013","false","42.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The turn based battle system puts you in control of multiple "troops" who operate with vague and often times unpredictable mechanics. You would expect that since you are incharge of a small army, you would also have a good understanding of the terran, troop movements, ect. Wrong. You have no sense of space whatsoever during any point of the battle. This eliminates gameplay as sound strategy and makes each encounter a crapshoot with the player often times hoping for the best.\n\nAs for the characters and story... there is none. The characters are souless and without clear motivations. Their relationships are never well established or developed. Essentially, everybody is just there and has a loose reason to be on this "quest". The story is choppy, full of glaring plot holes and is as ill defined as its characters. It gives no real sense of threat or urgency when it's time to go out and face the bad guys, nor does it explore why each character would be vested in the story's goals. You just have to do cuz there's nothing else to do... except side quests. Speaking of...\n\nThe side quests are a bunch of repetative nonsense that feel tacked on to the story and service no real purpose except to be finished by completionists. (This is not to say that other RPG's do it better, but it contributes to the souless nature of this game. There is just no drive, interest or reason to really do much of anything. You do it because it's there. The end.)\n\nAt least the art and music are good. But if that's all that interests you... Go to the symphony.","February 2, 2014","false","78.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The first hours of the game have you in a tutorial where you just follow commands. After I was done with that and finally got control of my own units, i spent about an hour grinding cause the game kinda didn't tell me how to trigger the next flag. The story is bland as oatmeal, with some voiceovers being really cringeworthy.\n\nBut then to the meat of the game, the combat. Much to the credit of the game, they are trying something new, instead of controlling single characters actions you now control a group of characters (called a Union). The combat system is simple enough with a leveling system even simpler, use stuff and it eventually levels up. Although leveling up doesn't help you much since the game heavily relies on numbers and RNG, what those numbers might be I couldn't tell you, since the game in no way explains it. RNG is also a big factor, when against the same mob (as in reloading a save and actually fighting the same mob) the outcome of the first round was wildly different, ranging from killing a enemy union without getting hit to myself being one-shotted, this against exactly the same mob.\n\nThe game looks pretty enough (if you can overlook som glitchy graphics) although most of the enviroments seems to be quite boring. The dungeons throws nonsense mechanics at you for no reason at all *door shuts down and you get to fight the same mobs you've been chomping like tic-tacs to get there*. In another dungeon there is a slow-down fog, it does nothing exept slow you down, so instead of wasting 5 seconds running down an empty hallway, you now get to enjoy the same empty hallway for a minute.\n\nAll in all, the game reminds me alot of FFX, if you take away intresting scenes, combat and story.","January 1","false","9.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Firstly, although it is an old game, and animation awkwardness and other graphical issues are to be expected, one would have thought that these would be fixed when the port to PC was made, but I found no sign of that here.\n\nWhen I was introduced to the battle system, my honest thought was, "Ugh, is the entire game going to play like this?" to which more progress into the game told me it was. The battle system is rather confusing at first, and doesn't really get all that better with the explanations further inot the game as I found myself asking where the decisions where in terms of what techniques to use or who to attack with which individual character. Admittedly, since this game was from Square Enix, I was more or less expecting something along the lines of their other fare, which I did not find here. I'm really not the type that likes to control large groups of soldiers or particularly a fan of RTSes, which this game had enough of to make me not want to play any longer.\n\nI also wasn't able to get invested in the story right away, and could see that if I was feeling like skipping the cutscenes already, that I wasn't going to enjoy game over all.","January 2","false","0.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

For a squarenix game its really lame. The story is weird. Characters tell you about things, events, people and you are supposed to care but you just dont. They said something once and of we go with the story. Go somewhere, save someone, introductoin of several new character, events, wars, political connections, ambitions, artifacts and so on.\nBut the storytelling in this game is so pathetic that the old final fantasy games (even the first one) gave you more satisfaction from playing. Here you learn random information in such random order that grinding in this game is more fun that learning about the story.\n\n"Oh, your sisters was kidnapped? No worries i lend you ALL my generals to help you. I dont know you but what the hell " Screw  protection of the country\n\n(Those generals can fall to basic monsters, pathetic and illogical)\n\n"Oh, the academy took part in kidnapping? My god thats terrible"   What academy? Whos the leader? Why would i care?\n\n"Oh, your pendant glows in front of that guy that just disappeared into thin air?  Then drop everything and find him"  Why damn it? What is this pendant?\n\n"Oh, he bind himself to the "ark"?  Thats... bad?  What now? Oh, hes kind enough to unbind himself. So now we are happy?  Still dont know why\n\n'Npc's talk about some strange creature that was spotted in town. You meet this thing. "Oh wanna go with us? Cool" Npc's forgets about him.\n\nA character dies. You lost a party member but dont worry. Here is the child of this character that was passing by (you litteraly had no idea that this child exist) and can go with us instead of the dead one.\n"Wanna talk about your dead parent? You dont give a fu***? Cool"\n\nSome major thing happend. Narration starts: "6 months later... the goverment dealt with the situation... yada yada" And what was happening with the main characters during this 6 months? Absolutly fu**** nothing. Move on with the story and dont ask anything if something is stupid.\n\nI would write something about the ending but its kinda hard to NOT spoil it (still stupid, random and not enough explanation)\n\n\nI LITERALLY fell asleep during playing.\n\nBattle system is original but is it fun? Im not sure. Kinda random. And slaying one character in a group of people kills them all cause they share the hp. Kinda stupid.\n\nAudio is neutral. Nothing special.\n\nMovement animation is sometimes pathetic. The great emperor of "some country" does something badass  and then he walks away like his sliding on the floor. Kills mood instantly.\n\nThe overall feelings from the animation makes you think that you are playing Final Fantasy 12 (witch is a really good game) But as i said the movement of characters detroys evrything\n\nIm not a hater.\nI love JRPGs and played most (if not all) Squaresoft/squareenix titles, Tales of... games, Dragon quests and so on but this game isnt worth paying for.\n\nThis game feels like it was made in a month by some third rate company from america that wanted to imitate the way that japanese makes rpg but failed like hell.\n\nIts my opinion but this is the only game (from ALL of games i ever played, not just jrpgs)  in my 20+ years of playing that made me feel so much angry, confused and sleepy at the same time\n\nAfter 7 hours of playing i didnt found anything good in this game\n\nI know its just 7 hours. But during this 7 hours i found nothing that would make me enjoy this game\n\n\nMaybe the ending is a little emotional but still gives you few questions about the events\n\nJust buy some other jrpg\n\n\nThis is a god damn JRPG. The story is the most important part of jrpg. The story in THIS game sucks. Period\n\nFinished the game. Still not worth buying\n\n\nMaybe the way i wrote this review is a little chaotic but believe me, its nothing compared to this game\n\n\nPeace","August 13, 2015","false","18.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

In combat you then choose overall orders like "attack enemy with magic / physical abilites" etc. Overall the system is a bit similar to Fire Emblem.\n\nBut that is where the bad stuff happens. Actually the game never bothers to tell you anything. Not about how the specialization, itemization and development of units works. Not even what the different orders for the combat do. That is where the game just becomes a bad joke. At some point I got three options for hitting the enemies with physical abilities. All costing the same amount of ability points, but I had no clue what order makes what unit use which ability.\nFor a game that wants you to micro so much of the units, their equipment and their skills, you have practicall NO controll over their behaviour in combat.\nAnother example: At some point I decided to do a pure healer squad for backing my fighters up, since they got ganged by AoE-attacks during a hard fight. So I put a few magic users in a squad, told them to only use their healing abilities and let them wait in the background to heal the others. Which was utterly useless. Only like every 3 rounds I got the option to heal the other squad, which was pretty dead at that point. BUT was I happy to notice that my healers had the possibily to smach the dragons skill in with their puny staffs.\nAlso, of course you don't know what enemies you fight before you encounter them. So in the same area there can be a group of 2 units which you can one-hit. Then the next encounter is a disguised mini-boss, who summons elite squads every round and hit all your squads every time it attacks. No jokes, those monsters stood right next to each other.\n\nAlso I can and will not give thumbs up for a game that just continues to crash when you attempt to change the graphic options. That is just flat out ridiculous.","April 9, 2014","false","21.5"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

I really can not understand how this game could get so many positive reviews. It failes at so many levels. First of all it features the most annoying male protagonist ever. And that really isn't a good start for a game when the character you start the game with is causing you pain just listening to him.\n\nIt also features a horribly random combat system. Not just is the order in which characters and enemies got to take an action random. Also the actions a character has available at his turn are down to randomness. You desperately need to heal? Well, you can only pray that in the next turn the game gives you the option to heal as one of the available actions.\n\nI lost a lot of fights not because of doing anything wrong, but simply because the random number generator decided to not give me the option to heal when I would have needed it. Terrible design.\n\nAnother prime example of terrible design would be the leveling system. It's probably the most counter-intuitive leveling system ever featured in an RPG. Rule number 1: the less you fight the easier the game is. Getting a higher battle rank in this game is NOT a good thing. It will make basically all encounters harder up to the point that some become outright frustrating thanks to the randomness of the combat system.\n\nThe easiest way to play this game is to just run through the areas and avoid fighting as much as possible...\n\n\nI never finished the game. The combination of meh story, painful main character, and the terribly random combat system extinguished my interest in completing the game fairly quickly.\n\nI really can not recommend this game to anyone.

Despite solid potential in the form of an excellent storyline and brilliant characters, the game is let down by an awqward progression system and a difficulty curve that is so inconsistent, a visual representation would look like a bowl of frustrated spaghetti.\n\nThe Last Remnant follows an intriguing storyline, vividly brought to life through brilliant character acting and the very best quality voice acting.  The excellent production allows the player to really connect with the characters and experience the feels of story to the fullest.  Unfortunately, the ridiculous jumps in difficulty negate this by forcing the player to spend great lengths of time struggling to progress, ultimately destroying the rhythm of the story.  Impossible chain boss fights are sudden and deny the player any chance for recuperation, so much so that even multiple save files will not save you (hue hue) from hours of punishment.  Add to this the long, arduous random battles which can accumulate into hours of necessary grinding to rectify the tardy and deceptive progression system known as 'battle rank' and any enjoyment quickly fizzles away.\n\nThe main point of interest in The Last Remnant is the battle system.  The player controls several parties of characters in the form of a turn based strategy with real time combat elements.  This is not particularly effective as the player is limited to a pre-determined set of attacks depending on the situation, inevitably replacing strategy with luck.  The real time combat elements have been cleverly integrated to sway the tide of battle if executed correctly and play a major role in determining the outcome of each fight.  Outside of battle the gameplay is fairly limited in terms of exploration and despite there being plentiful completionist content and a strangely addictive appeal, the majority is simply empty dialogue followed by a re-run of previously visited dungeons.\n\nOverall, The Last Remnant shows promise but quickly succumbs to its flaws which hinder the game from ever competing on the same level as it's better known stablemates.  If you are an RPG enthusiast with a high tolerance for frustration then you may be able to enjoy The Last Remnant.  If not, you would be better off looking elsewhere.\n\n3 subligars out of 5.","November 8, 2015","false","71.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I find myeslf dying from one group of regular monsters...despite fully understanding the combat system. It's just a really unbalnced game. I ground for hours to beat ONE rare boss mob in an early cave area. Still impossible to beat it. I understand the combat....my characters are well leveled.

Androgenous heroes. ♥♥♥♥, the females in this game look more manly than the males...I don't need a ♥♥♥♥ing lesson in androgeny. Square Enix, has lost their luster...and then some.

Gone is the traditional micro of turn-based combat; instead you direct each group to focus on magic or combat techniques and which enemy groups to engage - and then watch as both forces charge towards each other, resulting in interceptions, flanking, and morale swings. Late-game, the respawning normal monster combats become tedious, but the boss battles only get more EPIC.\nGorgeous visuals: I was once stuck on a quest wandering around a giant desert for 2hrs or so - and I didn't care, because the sand dunes in every direction just looked so pretty.\nImmersive storyline of the kind SquareEnix is known for.

It Shares a lot of similarities to final fantasy 12, it builds on and expands the freedom of exploration, merchant crafting system, monster hunting system and combat system.\n\nThe story you will either like it or you wont. I liked the overall story but I really didnt like a couple of the main characters, enough to skip cutscenes with them. a bit like Hope in FF13.\n\nThe combat takes things to a completely new level. You start out with your standard 2-3 person party to learn the ropes with and progress naturally over the course of the game to 18 party members spead over up to 5 squads. Thankfully its turn based so you can plan out your attacks. Although you dont see it, there is an underlying battle grid that the fights take place on. The relative positions of you and your enemy play the main role in determining what attack/skill options you have available, which get learnt over time. You can either take it at face value and charge in, or learn the intricacies to take full control of the battles and play at a tactical level.\n\nCharacter progression has been done very well, most of the micromanagement has been taken out, instead of having to craft/individually gear 18+ party members they just chime in when they want something. Skill progression is handled equally well on the PC version, you can either direct them in a specific combat direction or you can allow them to develop organically by enabling/disabling skill trees, which also determines their overall class.\n\noverall i'd give it:\n6/10 story\n9/10 battle system\n8/10 character development\n8/10 game world\n\nIf your an avid final fantasy fan (at least up till 12) this game needs to be in your collection.","December 26, 2014","true","97.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The animation, frankly, is as clunky as all get-out - it's best played after playing something like Final Fantasy VII or VIII (the original PS versions if you can get them) as something of a palate cleanser if you're a real graphics junkie (or you could go the whole hog and just play Angband or a similar text-based RPG as a starter).  The battle system is different - it's turn-based (as with the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest series), but instead of making decisions about each individual fighter's actions, you're issuing commands to groups of fighters (and they will perform their actions based on your command).  You don't get access to every possible command - instead, you're choosing from a limited list - between six to eight options most of the time, narrowing down to about two or three when things get really nasty.  If you're a gameplay or a graphics fan, this probably isn't the game for you.\n\nIf, like me, you're interested in story and worldbuilding, however, this game is *brilliant*.  The world is complex and well-realised, and it's fun to be sitting down and figuring out the back-story and the background politics.  The story is fascinating, and if you're a slash fan, it is a hoot how slashtastic the interaction between Rush and David (pronounced Dah-veed) turns out to be at times - and the slashtastic moments start very early on in the game.  The art is marvellously detailed, the backgrounds are glorious, and the characters are wonderfully created.  In many ways, I get the sense they spent so much time and effort on creating the story and the artwork that when it came time to add the animation and the gameplay, they'd almost run through the budget.  This resulted in very unrealistic movement (it's almost as though their animation models were puppets on strings - it is *very* Thunderbirds movement at times) and a lot of skimped details in the FMV scenes (the one which sticks in my head is one scene where Rush is sitting on a bed... and because the bed isn't animated at all, it stays a rigid rectangular shape.  All I could think is "that has to be hell on the back").\n\nIt's almost a pity, in a way, they didn't put the same amount of time and effort into animating their artwork that they did into crafting it.  The voice actors do their best (although if you're familiar with British accents at all, you'll notice Lord David's accent keeps sneaking off toward Sarf Lunnon when he isn't watching) but really, given they're trying to effectively make wooden dolls live, their best has a limited effect.\n\nAs I said earlier: if you really need good animation and good gameplay to make a storyline live for you, this probably isn't the game for you.  If, on the other hand, you're a big fan of complex worldbuilding, interesting characters, and a fascinating plot, you'll probably be able to find enjoyment in the game despite the rather wooden movement.","December 18, 2014","true","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is fascinating, and if you're a slash fan, it is a hoot how slashtastic the interaction between Rush and David (pronounced Dah-veed) turns out to be at times - and the slashtastic moments start very early on in the game.  The art is marvellously detailed, the backgrounds are glorious, and the characters are wonderfully created.  In many ways, I get the sense they spent so much time and effort on creating the story and the artwork that when it came time to add the animation and the gameplay, they'd almost run through the budget.  This resulted in very unrealistic movement (it's almost as though their animation models were puppets on strings - it is *very* Thunderbirds movement at times) and a lot of skimped details in the FMV scenes (the one which sticks in my head is one scene where Rush is sitting on a bed... and because the bed isn't animated at all, it stays a rigid rectangular shape.  All I could think is "that has to be hell on the back").\n\nIt's almost a pity, in a way, they didn't put the same amount of time and effort into animating their artwork that they did into crafting it.  The voice actors do their best (although if you're familiar with British accents at all, you'll notice Lord David's accent keeps sneaking off toward Sarf Lunnon when he isn't watching) but really, given they're trying to effectively make wooden dolls live, their best has a limited effect.\n\nAs I said earlier: if you really need good animation and good gameplay to make a storyline live for you, this probably isn't the game for you.  If, on the other hand, you're a big fan of complex worldbuilding, interesting characters, and a fascinating plot, you'll probably be able to find enjoyment in the game despite the rather wooden movement.","December 18, 2014","true","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gone is the traditional micro of turn-based combat; instead you direct each group to focus on magic or combat techniques and which enemy groups to engage - and then watch as both forces charge towards each other, resulting in interceptions, flanking, and morale swings. Late-game, the respawning normal monster combats become tedious, but the boss battles only get more EPIC.\nGorgeous visuals: I was once stuck on a quest wandering around a giant desert for 2hrs or so - and I didn't care, because the sand dunes in every direction just looked so pretty.\nImmersive storyline of the kind SquareEnix is known for.

The Last Remnant caught my eye from the get-go with its visuals but dulled me back to real life with its  nuanse of storytelling and smaller-than-it-looks worlds. You play as Rush, a stubborn and small-minded individual out to save his sister and the world from destruction (How different!). What saves the narrative is a union-based system that gives you a commander-shouting experience. Rather than control each member, you're giving directions to the union as a whole and letting them decide.\n\nIt gives the game a unique flair and really, Steam should list "Strategy" as its 2nd or 3rd tag. Without a proper setup; having a healer, disabler, tank, area of effect abilities, you'll be left scratching your head, getting smashed from some of the more formidable story bosses. Thankfully Steam gives you an emulator-esque experience, letting you save at any point in the game as long as you're not presently in a battle. This means you can rewind and plan accordingly. Thin your numbers out with more unions and flank the enemy? Bolster two-three unions for a direct assault? Focus on moral boosting units and leader special abilities?\n\nAcquiring more party members is also a treat as you'll be entering towns and recruiting people from various guilds. Getting the better party members requires you to do sidequests... and boy are some of them lengthy. Despite an engaging battle system that keeps you interested, it also has flaws. For one the commands are random. If you want a unit to do something specific, chances are it may not show up. Heal this union? No, sorry, I'll heal this other one. Use our special union ability even though we have enough mana? Maybe next turn. It's discouraging as well as prolongs otherwise 20-30 seconds fights into 2-3 minute charades.\n\nBuy:  For the gameplay\nDon't buy: For the plot","September 23, 2014","true","85.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Absolutely incredible. The Last Remnant is unlike any other RPG i've ever played. Characters grow stronger through battle like most RPGs, but instead of EXP, the individual stats of a character will increase through battle, kind of like a fixed version of FFII. What I really thought was unique in the game was how the party is formed. Units on the battlefield are represented by groups. You assign individual characters to act as one, and then you can assign a formation to that group which can improve a variety of combat skills. I was lucky enough to get this during the Steam Summer Sale for only $2. And let me say, it was the best $2 I have ever, and will spend in my entire life. The only downside is that the game spikes in difficulty sometimes, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I don't think it's good either.

Although the game does start slow and somewhat hard, it progresses to be on a perfect pace on gameplay with the story progressing on an equal scale, making for a perfect blend of a gaming experience.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics is based off of randomly generated moves based on what you already know, and is changed based upon who you target. Your playable characters are grouped into parties that will be affected in different ways depending on who is in it. What affects the group? In general, the type of combat preference your characters have, the formation you have the group in (You'll see soon enough in the game once you can recruit multiple members into your parties), and finally how many people are in a party. You can have multiple parties.\n\nSpeaking of the story specifically, it is well written, but is by no means a master piece, but as I had said, the story the game brings is fulfulling and is more than enough to please you.\n\nGameplay specifically, as I had previously mentioned, this game starts out slow and somewhat hard. Grinding is not exactly mandatory in this game, but is somewhat appreciated if you refuse to fight boss battles over and over. The game really wants boss battles in this game to live up to it's name. And in the beginning of the game, boss battles are excepionally harder than most fights you will encounter.\n\nAlso, a REALLY IMPORTANT note to make, all boss battles are preceded by a cutscene of varying length, usually more than a minute or more in length. This is important to mention because CUTSCENES ARE UNSKIPPABLE, meaning that if you fail a boss battle, you will have to suffer watching the same cutscene over and over. Hence, grinding is somewhat a real recommendation early on in the game. If you are finding yourself in this loop of a boss battle failing, I reccomend going back and grinding a level or two and consider upgrading your equipment and changing your parties' formations. Also, shift tab is reccomended if you can't stand the cutscenes. This is probably the only problem you will have with this game.\n^Tl;dr: Grind if you hate time passing you by without making progress.\n\nAlso, another note worth mentioning is that this game has a New Game+, which means that after you beat the game, you can play through it again retaining all your arts you learned as well as components you use to make items in the game.\nAlthough if you plan to play New Game+, you should SPLIT ALL UNNEEDED ITEMS before the final boss. You lose everything in material things but components, you even lose your gold.\n\n*Any gold you get in New Game+'s start is based on how many quests you did.\n\n\nAlthough, a perfect thing to be mentioned is that this game might not be for everyone. But with everything in mind, this game is by all means a decent thing to buy, especially consideing its low cost on steam.\n\n\n\n*Can skip cutscenes with an xbox controller, only\nAlso, a note worth mentioning, this game is fully xbox controller compatible, and the game is automatically set to think you are playing with an xbox controller.\nChange the controls first thing you get into the game, unless you want to be forced to by invonvenience\n\n\n^^^^^^^^^ TL;DR: I RECCOMEND THIS GAME, GRIND IF HARD.

Here is The Last Remnant a jrpg with turn based battles that feature some RTS elements. More in depth we have:\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nIn TLR you get to control a youth named Rush. You venture in 3D invironments in towns and dungeons while the city and wolrd maps are simple images (kinda .. "Naaaaahh" to me). The enemies are visible on the screen and you can ambush them avoid them or get ambushed (you dont wanna do that). Well here comes the sad part! The battle system thought it seems quite promising it ends to be very boring one sided and soooo automated! Well its seems like the developers would like to make it extremely simple yet strangely difficult to win a battle. What do i mean? Here is the thing. When you enter the battle there is no option of escape!! The player has to choose between some automated commands like "attack", or "back em up" or "attack with combat arts". Seriously? All you have to be careful about is not to get flanked (amonst enemies) and all is great! i mean come on?! what happened to equipping magic or using items manually and stuff like that!? Many will say that TLR differs cos it is more like strategy when it comes to the battle part but i disagree! Even if it is that way its quite noobish! Unfortunately gameplay isnt its strong part!\n\nPLOT:\n\nThe plot is quite classic yet very enjoyable with the classic fantasy world and its kingdoms. In the first intro we see Rush rushing into a battlefield while he searches for his freshly kidnapped sister! i wont do any more spoilers. Play it yourselves!\n\nMUSIC:\n\nThe music part is one of its strong points i guess where its plave has its own music.

You know how every time a new console launches, developers show off games with huge epic battles? This is the Square Enix take on that trope. It's a Final-Fantasy-esque affair where instead of a party of four, you merrily traipse around with a small army.\n\nIt features the most complicated, in-depth, opaque menu battle system I've ever seen. Things start off a little slow, the wiki is required reading, and the story doesn't seem to be anything special. But squad management and battles are a lot of fun. If you want a classic style JRPG with actually interesting gameplay, this is it. It goes ridiculously cheap on a regular basis, so maybe wait a couple weeks for a sale.","August 11, 2014","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here is The Last Remnant a jrpg with turn based battles that feature some RTS elements. More in depth we have:\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nIn TLR you get to control a youth named Rush. You venture in 3D invironments in towns and dungeons while the city and wolrd maps are simple images (kinda .. "Naaaaahh" to me). The enemies are visible on the screen and you can ambush them avoid them or get ambushed (you dont wanna do that). Well here comes the sad part! The battle system thought it seems quite promising it ends to be very boring one sided and soooo automated! Well its seems like the developers would like to make it extremely simple yet strangely difficult to win a battle. What do i mean? Here is the thing. When you enter the battle there is no option of escape!! The player has to choose between some automated commands like "attack", or "back em up" or "attack with combat arts". Seriously? All you have to be careful about is not to get flanked (amonst enemies) and all is great! i mean come on?! what happened to equipping magic or using items manually and stuff like that!? Many will say that TLR differs cos it is more like strategy when it comes to the battle part but i disagree! Even if it is that way its quite noobish! Unfortunately gameplay isnt its strong part!\n\nPLOT:\n\nThe plot is quite classic yet very enjoyable with the classic fantasy world and its kingdoms. In the first intro we see Rush rushing into a battlefield while he searches for his freshly kidnapped sister! i wont do any more spoilers. Play it yourselves!\n\nMUSIC:\n\nThe music part is one of its strong points i guess where its plave has its own music. It is very pompous and magnificent at parts and get you quite well in the mood\n\nGRAPHICS:\n\nGraphics are wuite detailed and "clean" with lots of colors and drawn and designed with creativity and talent! The only thing is that sometimes it gives me the impression that there is so much symmetry especially in towns!\n\nOVERALL:\n\nIn general terms TLR is a game worthy of your time and money that every jrpg games must at least once experience!","September 5, 2014","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Absolutely incredible. The Last Remnant is unlike any other RPG i've ever played. Characters grow stronger through battle like most RPGs, but instead of EXP, the individual stats of a character will increase through battle, kind of like a fixed version of FFII. What I really thought was unique in the game was how the party is formed. Units on the battlefield are represented by groups. You assign individual characters to act as one, and then you can assign a formation to that group which can improve a variety of combat skills. I was lucky enough to get this during the Steam Summer Sale for only $2. And let me say, it was the best $2 I have ever, and will spend in my entire life. The only downside is that the game spikes in difficulty sometimes, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I don't think it's good either.

It seems to have fairly decent depth, the world seems moderately vibrant, the combat is complex (perhaps a tad much) and the animations and graphics are solid.\n\nThere's two big gripes I have with this game, one being a lack of aesthetically impactful design in terms of music. The music is bland and barely memorable. Not much more to be said for it.\n\nThe other gripe is that the game is a tremendously lazy port, to the point where all instructions show an Xbox controller button rather than a keyboard key. Rewriting the tutorials would've done wonders, but instead, players are forced to look up and perhaps even jot down all the important keys. This is particularly painful with the battle mechanism of critical calls, something akin to the action commands from Mario & Luigi and Paper Mario. The screen will show the A, B, Y and X buttons or the Right Trigger, and you're supposed to figure out what to press without any appropriate visual cue. (In case you're interested, it's the arrow keys for the A, B, Y and X buttons, and space bar for the Right Trigger)\n\nOther than that, the game seems rather promising and I hope it will continue to deliver.","December 29, 2013","true","20.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In the 32, there were classics of the genre like Eternal Arcadia, Sakura Wars and Grandia II. Oh, no Final Fantasy? Haven't played once since the Sony monopoly began, which was why this, as one of Square-Enix's cross platform (initially Xbox 360 exclusive) JRPGs was so enticing. I longed to see what they had in store for me. HIronobu Sakaguchi was gone, but I had Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon, both excellent if not old fashioned games. Sadly, Last Remnant (Last? What is it about JRPGs from this pedigree exhausting the same thesaurus entry?) ran terribly on console. It's release on PC has greatly alleviated these problems, but alas, something about the game leaves me cold. It plays great and has a unique combat and character system, yet ,,, the last remnant of what I onced loved about the genre has dried up.

I have put probably about 300-400 hours into this game (not on steam, but mostly on xbox). I bought it on PC because it is a superior version which does allow more specific choices for characters and doesn't punish you for grinding.\nI Think the battle system and character progression system is great, but not for everybpdy. Your characters will grow depending on the commands you give in battle, the commands you get to choose from in battle are limited, but are always swayed by the choices you have made for that group of characters previously. Instead of having 6 focused characters, which you make specific choices for growth, like in the usual JRPG fare, you have 20 characters and make general choices in combat that indirectly affect the character's growth. It means that all the choices you make will have an impact, so you have to be mindful of what abilities you want a group to have.\nThe battles are both challenging and engaging and unlike other JRPGs I've played. The fact they are large scale is really enjoyable, and you can also speed past them if you'd like. If you really want to enjoy it, you will need to use the wiki for it. There are details which appear as random in this game, but are really a number of complex factors that create a coherent, if unclear, system.\nThe game's content is mostly sidequests and completely optional, and are amongst the most rewarding challenges I have faced in most JRPGs. I always feel like there is more I could do and more progression I could make, creating powerful and interesting combinations of characters.\nI thik this title is greatly misunderstood and underrated because of the sub-par Xbox release, but is really a unique JRPG gem and will shine through if you have the time and interest.","September 30, 2014","true","130.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No? Well then you're screwed"\nThen there is formation which supposedly increase (and decrease) squad stats but in the end it all seems rather pointless because 90% of the time you'll be getting flanked or bombed by spells that damage all characters in a squad seperately leading to an overall mass damage for a squad (so 5 people in a squad get hit for 600 dmg each equals a tasty 3000 dmg which amounts to most of your life or instant death of course you can put fewer people in, though it helps the overall squad life is lower and AP replen. is much slower, in this case it takes a couple of enemy groups to destroy your smaller group. Just to add to it no matter what formation you use the Def. of the group will be stupidly low so any arts above Level III will usually take most of your sqauds life if not kill your squad all together. Great fun....\n\nAnother wonderful aspect of the game sometimes you will find items that are race specific, sounds awesome yes? Well no because you CANNOT equipt ANY items to ANYONE other than Rush (the main character) so yeah thanks for that.\nSo you can't equipt squaddies with stuff, so what do you do? Well you can gather materials for them so they can uograde their weapons, which is fine BUT most of the items you need you have to fight specific monsters, that's all fine the real catch is that if you have the items you CANNOT just give them to your squaddies so you will end up fighting monsters you'd rather never see again and in some cases fighting monsters that destroyed you last time you fought them.\n\nNow one amazingly big Peeve is that characters have a unique attribute Like Emma has Love, David has Authority and so on but NO-ONE knows exactly WHAT they do!? And of course the sensible thing is to access help to look at the details but of course the ever declining Square Enix didn't bother to put that in so you have an attribute that is just 'there' with no idea what it is for... On a side note during scenes characters all have a weird jaunted walk, kinda like Front Mission 3. Hilarious and nostalgic :D\n\nDESPITE the very MANY problems with the game, it is easy to get into and the story is pretty cool (At least to me it is) the unique leader characters all have their own personalities and backstories (which takes ages to uncover) and that game can prove a challenge (mostly due to its flaws, but it's manageable at least). It's got a nice mix of politics, scheming and heroics with some dramas and cool battle scenes, some of the unique skills look pretty awesome too.","July 27, 2014","true","43.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
