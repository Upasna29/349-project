This game is not good, and not even particularly good for the time.  There's like 80 levels or something, but about 10 levels of actual content.  There's not a lot of puzzle or enemy variety, just the same building blocks used over and over again.  I mean, it's a decent challenge, and they get a lot of mileage out of it, but...\n\nWell, when you read the directions, the developer is excited to talk about his FAST system of animation that makes things super fluid, but makes everything have a rectangular bounding box larger than the actual guy/trap/bullet.  This really should read more like an apology for being a bad programmer because this large bounding box nearly ruins the game.  You can sort of learn to leave extra space so you don't run into stuff when clearly nothing is touching, but it's frsutrating and most of your deaths will be a result of this FAST system and it's #$%@! hit detection and oh now my heart's acting up.\n\nAnyway, it's a bad game now, it was a mediocre game back then, and it's not worth spending more than a few nostalgic miniutes poking at it.  Almost any modern platformer will be a better use of your time even if they don't have FAST(tm)(r)(c) technology.\n\nEspecially if they don't.","May 6, 2015","false","4.7"," 24 of 37 people (65%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","65","24","37","7","0"

But let's get something straight first: this is an old-school platformer.  And I don't mean that in a good way.  Here is an idea of some negative things to expect:\n\n- Hit detection is horrible and you *will* get frustrated by it.\n- The graphics are very low resolution, even compared to other titles in the 3D Realms Pack.\n- The game only uses four colors.\n- The levels use the same blocks over and over.\n- The levels are very small.\n\nSo why am I giving this a thumbs-up?  Simply put, I think the level designers actually did a pretty good job given what they had to work with.  Like I said, the levels are very small.  But I found them pretty interesting.  As an example, they often feature disappearing and appearing blocks that will route the player around in unusual ways.  Some of the more challenging levels require the player to carefully plan what order to get objects in to keep from getting stuck.  There are definitely some interesting ideas here, mixed in with the occasional bit of "old-school" unfairness.\n\nI wouldn't call it a great platformer by modern standards, but I did find it an interesting diversion when I had a few minutes to burn.  The levels are so short that you can do one or two very quickly and then move on to something else.  (Note: Press 's' to save game and 'r' to restore.  I don't see that documented anywhere.)\n\nAnd this isn't just nostalgia speaking, either.  I didn't play this one when I was growing up, though I did play its (much better) sequel, Arctic Adventure.  Don't get the 3D Realms Anthology for this game, but don't be afraid to check it out.\n","July 6, 2015","true","3.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Sure it's a simple platformer with rough collision detection but it's possible to work out what's a safe jump or not. Finished the first episode which I was never able to as a kid so if you have any nostalgia for the game it's a nice way to spend an hour.","June 21, 2015","true","1.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"
