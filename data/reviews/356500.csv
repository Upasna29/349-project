If you want to play the game here is what you need to do. I tested it on a windows 10 pc, I'll try it on other win10 computers. First, run the game through steam in your library, it will ask you to install directPlay, go ahead and install it. Afterwards it will try to run but won't work. Now go to where the game is installed, locate the launcher(should be under C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\STAR WARS - Galactic Battlegrounds Saga\Game) Then run compability testing on the launcher and try the recommended settings. If that doesn't work, go to properties of the launcher and check run as administrator. Annnnnndddd if that doesn't work, try checking the run in windows xp service pack mode and administrator mode. I spent hours checking this and these methods seem to work.\nI always wanted to play this game, so when I saw it on the store, I couldn't resist. I played more offline so the amount of time I've spent isn't shown. If you like star wars and age of empires 2 then you won't be dissapointed.\n\nUPDATE: Uh... I didn't expect this much feedback. Also, I forgot to mention another issue, you may need to temporarily disable your firewall if the compability mode doesn't work, just tested it on another windows 10 pc.\n\nUPDATE: . Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds All-In-One Patch by "|)in-d1n". This should get it working on win10","March 1","true","3.5"," 342 of 386 people (89%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","89","342","386","13","20"

Yes, absolutely! Would it be nice if this Steam version actually worked on modern hardware instead of being broken?

Game interface, units upgrades, game balance, units AI, resource managment and even 4-tier tech levels are a clear copy/paste of what we know from Age of Empires 2.\nThis is just the same game when we speak about it's roots, and the only one diffirence is Star Wars license used during development. Layout has been re-skinned and developers implemented new campaigns inspired of course by Star Wars Universe.\n\nThe most important thing you might ask will sounds like: is this game still playable?\nThe answer is not simple and depends on what you expect. If you loved Age of Empires series and if you're a fan of Star Wars then for sure it will be a very interesting trip.\nI still remember how bad this game was when Microsoft relased it. We (RTS fans) had too high hopes and thats why Galactic Batlegrounds was a huge disappointment.\nBut now? In 2016? It's funny but game became a better experience. Why? Because now you can experience it as a relic from the past, so expectations are lowered to minimum.\nOne thing for sure - if you still like old RTS games, then definietly you will like Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds as well.\nThanks for reading!","March 1","true","3.5"," 163 of 210 people (78%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","78","163","210","30","3"

The executable file launches, but it does nothing but run in the background, eating 15 to 30 percent of my CPU until I forcibly close it with task manager. I’ve tried many combinations of the Windows compatibility modes with no change. The non-expansion version of the game works, but you have to launch it outside of Steam. Trying to start a game from the main menu gives an error saying “You must insert a game CD…” but this was fixed by plugging in a disc drive; the actual disc was not needed. The in-game music seems to be missing, despite the menu music being fine. Also, playing this way obviously lacks the content added by the Clone Campaigns expansion. I find all these issues very strange considering that my retail disc version of the game runs 100% fine.\n\nPlease note that this is my experience, and that yours may be different.

Each faction is hugely similar with surprisingly large amounts of differences, primarily a completely new look for every unit in each team, and also their abilities beyond the units.  The Trade Federation does not need to build any Prefab. Shelters, giving MAXIMUM population cap at the start of the game.  Republic get's 6 and stealth Jedi Fighters, Empire has AT-ATs that CAN ATTACK AIR!  <--My favorite faction.  Plus various game modes that are only fun in LAN or direct connect situations.  There are 4 resources with Ore being the rarest, and a kind of limit for your massive fort and the game has many similarities of Age Of Empires...  but many more Dissimilarities such as Air units, an improved map editor, Completely different military buildings, AA-batteries, and many more things that you can find yourselves.\n\nAbout this version, (on steam)\n\nI have the GOG, Disk, and steam version of this game now and this remains one of my most favorite games of all time!\nBased on reliability, the disk does seem the best version...  but not the recommended for many reasons.\n\n\nI have to state that there I have had no issues running this game, which seems to be very fortunate compared to others, but to be truly objective, I am again comparing it to the GOG version which does cost the SAME and the people on that platform are happier with it and do not appear to have such an issue as to the NO CD bug, or even the game just not launching.  I do hope whatever has happened over there, comes to steam.\n\nBeware:  No native Widescreen  and the fixes that are present...  are fading away due to the age of this game and those posts.\n\nDo not worry about patches, this version is up to date, same one from the old disk.\n\nThis version is identical to the GOG release with the strange color fix (which is broken by some wide-screen ways requiring users to find that fix too!)\nThis version does not have anything unique or new from the original disk, with exception ot the strange color fix. Direct Connect and LAN are your only options for now.  (sorry, The Zone went away a long time ago in a galxy far far away...)  There is no present steam works available for servers but there are ways of a virtual LAN which I have not explored.\nRealistically, the GOG version will allow you to LAN in family with a single copy of the game, it's up to users however, to prevent it from spreading among friends to friends of friends and so on, otherwise that's the only real advantage of it over steam, to not have to buy it repeatedly.\n\n\n\nIs it for you?\n\nYes, if you like Star Wars and are comfortable with Age Of Empires.\nDon't forget this:\nLeft click selects, Right click tasks.  This is something missed in the tutorial!\n\nAnything upcoming in modding?Yes, Star Wars Expanding Fronts, a complete overhaul of the game, but it is still in extensive development\nFind it here:\nhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/star-wars-galactic-battlegrounds-expanding-fronts/news/forces-of-corruption","March 1","true","0.9"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","2"

Great AOE2 clone.\n\nTo expand on it a little bit, it's not really an exaggeration to call this an AOEII clone. It used the same engine, and it even plays exactly like it. It's like a Star Wars-Total Conversion mod for AOEII. And it works. Well, this version doesn't work well, but I'll come back to that. The campaigns are fun, playing AI singleplayer games is fun, multiplayer is fun but doesn't work anymore without some program like Gameranger. Of the three Star Wars strategy games, this one is probably the best, though Empire At War is still a great game.\n\nAs for this rerelease, it's kind of a travesty. It's hit and miss whether this works for people, and Clone Campaigns straight up didn't load when I first bought it. Go to that link and download that mod, and it fixed things for me. I don't know if any other mods work with that, but it will at least fix the base game. The GOG version works better out of the box, unfortunately. But if you bought the Humble Bundle, like I did, that mod will fix the game. and there are plenty of fixes on the forums if that guide doesn't solve your problems.\n\nThis is a great game that I played a ton of when I was a kid.

I sincerely hope for an update the likes of AoE2HD but it's not here at release.  From looking at the menus ingame and the files directory this is a verbatium copy of the 15 year old CD version with a different EXE to launch with.   It even still has the AutoPlay menu (which amusingly gets confused and thinks it isn't installed yet).  Theres still redundant menu entries for the long dead MSN Gaming Zone service which... holy ♥♥♥♥ guys, that's the whole reason we want to buy this game again. *AXE MSN ZONE JUNK FOR STEAM* and i'll switch my mind from a down rating to an up.  This was a great multiplayer game and its sad to see the release being a zero-improvments repackaging of old code thats no good in 2016.\n\nAbout the intro videos, if you hit the spacebar to skip them it will freeze.  The game does not freeze it's the intro player PAUSING the video because the release has been that slapped together.  Hit ESC to skip right to the front menu.\n\nIf you want to play online you'll still have to do the same thing as the CD version.  Direct IP address entry & someone hosting with port forwarding.  Come to think of it this will probably connect to another player actually using the CD version because it's THAT unchanged.\n\nIf you don't want to play online this release is... O.K.  Theres nothing terribly wrong with the game functionally on Windows 7 for me.  I've started a bot/AI match before writing this and it runs just fine.  Same old 4:3 limited resolution selections the game always had apply (800x600, 1024x768, 1280x1024) and while this doesn't really bother me it would be nice to use some modern screen resolutions.  I have not experienced the 'no disc error' that some other reviewers have mentioned.\n\nIf some updates actually come down the pipe I would happily change the rating but I'm not seeing anything to give me that hope right now.

The game flat out doesn't launch unless you do some extra configuration, the background music doesn't work, the expansion pack doesn't work, and inorder to launch the game you need to click the .exes directly in Windows Explorer rather than in the client.\n\nThis is a disgusting cash grab by Disney, and completely inexcusible because GOG fixed this game already. I highly suggest anyone who's curious about this game to buy the GOG release instead.\n\nhttps://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_galactic_battlegrounds_saga","March 1","false","0.3"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

After I saw a patch had gone live, I tried the game, as it was my absolute favorite as a kid. I have to say, I was extremely happy to have the game running near flawlessly from the get-go.\n\nI realized the music wasn't playing in-game, and in my efforts to fix it, I stumbled upon the "All-in-one" patch in the Steam guides. The patch fixed the music by incorporating a large library of random Star Wars scores, and also allowed for a wide-screen experience on my 1080p monitor.\n\nThe only complaint about the patch, is that it takes a few moments for the game to open up on my computer. For awhile,  I thought the game was non-responsive, as task manager didn't even acknowledge it (It also made my screen wierd, like showing only the upper left corner, but blown across the entire screen). I tried EVERYTHING, and then finally, just let it sit for a few minutes. It fired up and ran flawlessly, and when I shut it down, the screen goes back to normal.\n\nIf you're a Star Wars fan, who also enjoys Age of Kings, you'll want to try this game for sure! At $6, i've already gotten my money's worth out of it, and will likely continue wearing the game out for the forseeable future!","April 24","true","26.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

A physical disc version usually costs around 40bucks and the digital is 5.99 WITH the DLC.\nif Steam begins to support a online community for it this game can explode again. Back i nthe day there were some pretty cool Maps made by people too. World Blood, Galactic City Cuilder, Galactic Senate, Mech Wars, Trooper Wars, Turret Defence Games the lsit goes on and on.\nPeople give this game a chance its only 5.99 and if it gets big again i bet steam will make more of this happen.\nI literally logged like over 1000hrs into this game online btw so its clearly worth becuase i havnt logged anything clsoe to that many hours in recent games.\n","April 20","true","10.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

This is the game for you! Steam released this game without fixing a couple of minor Windows 10 agustments. Yes its a "Their bad" but if you play this game or played those similar (Star Wars: Age of Empires or Force Commander) this game pioneered the way for those follow up installments. I love this game, I remember when it came out when I was in grade school, it made an everyday afternoon into a puzzle-like game to think one step ahead of the enemy. If you love Age of Empires or Star Wars this game apeals to you. There are several of posts on the forums to fix any issue you may have. For my PC it was one issue and for my laptop another. The community helped my non-technologically-advanced-computing-capability to make this game work. I know very little about consols and even less about computers. Several of the forums litterally game me step by step instructions to fix the issues for both my computer and laptop both different brands with different software. So I beg you please support and buy this game to hopefully get an HD edition. This gaem would be amazing with high-def. If I can make it work you can too.

The only RTS I remember enjoying this much was Red Alert 2. Developed by the same guys that brought you Age of Empires, this game is going to be a blast to Star Wars fans who played AoE titles before. Because at the very core this is Age of Empires II in the Star Wars universe.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with the RTS genre, don't worry, the game provides a great tutorial on how to do everything you need to know. If you're a hardcore RTS player, do keep in mind that this is a slow paced RTS, you won't be able to rush your opponent with beginner units expecting to win. You'll need to advance in technological levels and upgrade your units before you feel like they have that "Oomph".\n\nWith total of six different factions to choose from (Galactic Empire, Rebel Alliance, Wookies, Royal Naboo, Trade Federation and Gungans), it really spices up the variety of the battlefield. Not to mention that at every upgrade your units receive (0 - 3 upgrades depending on the unit), they gain a different visual appearance.\n\nWhile units and structures vary from faction to faction, at the basic level, they're more or less the same "type" in a different shell, with some exceptions of course. Yes it can be viewed as a negative aspect but it does give you a sense of balance, so you don't feel like the other faction has the upper hand.\n\nBefore jumping to a skirmish battle, take the time to play the campaign missions. Not only they are well made and enjoyable, they also put you in different situations where you learn to play the game better.\n\nOverall, do I recommend this? Wholeheartedly. Is this a breathtaking masterpiece? Of course not, but it's a fun game and that's all that matters.","March 10","true","42.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

I played the first game for a long time and really enjoyed it. The graphics are good for the time that the game was developed in. Having 8 different factions in the game gives a different playing experience for each time you play one of the factions. Each faction has different advantages and weaknesses, and different units. It has a singleplayer, multiplayer (which I haven't tried on Steam yet), campaigns, and the scenario/campaign creator/editor. I am running Windows 8.1, but..... the only way I could make the game run is by installing the community patch. After I installed the patch I could launch it through the Steam games library and it ran normally without any issues. It is a really fun game to play, but it took a little bit of work to get it running.\n\nPros:\nLots of fun.\nLots of game modes.\nThe campaigns add a different element of play.\nYou can create your own campaigns and custom maps.\nEach side has different units.\nIntelligent A.I.\n\nCons:\nIt takes a little work to actually be able to play the game.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game because of all the unit/tech options and different playstyles of the game, but mostly because it is really enjoyable to play.","March 5","true","55.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's a fun simple but incredibly addictive game. I've recently found out it came out on steam and I've bought it and havn't regret it yet. I still own both of the Discs. The gameplay is amazing. Simpel to learn and a great time waster. The Sound design within the game also is on point some sounds ripped from the actual movies themself. The graphics very primitive but still good looking for what it is. I beilvie my one issue Is I cannot get the resoulution I would like (1920x1080) I'll have to get used to that for now like I have for the past 15 years.

I payd 1 dolar on humble bundle, but its sure worth more than that lol\nIts basically a reskined Age of Empires II. I know that some people dislike this game becouse of this, but for me its just the opposite. I like the game becouse its a reskined Age of Empires II (!).\nAs an Age and a Star Wars fan, its almost impossible to dislike this. There are thousands of Star Wars elements in this game, while keeping the same gameplay that make Age II/ Galactic Battleground a timeless classic. Ok, maybe Age II is "more classic" than Battlegrounds becouse it came first  and some many people play like lol\nIn my opionion, its the only good Star Wars RTS game. I tried to play Empire at War sometimes, but i just couldnt enjoy the gameplay,\nHowever, tecnically speaking this Steam launch was a disaster. I had to do download some non official fixes to make this game work. They didnt do a "re-launch for the new generation", its just the same game poorly ported to work in modern computers. Well, you may have a hard time making this work like me ;D\nIts not an innovative game, its really far from that. Its an Age II reskin that is really fun to play and spend your free time.","March 8","true","2.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","1"

If that happens to you just hit ESC which would normally skip the intro and the game loads into the menu as normal. Other than the game not playign the intro, it runs perfectly! (note: I'm using Win 8.1) Great game, just as awesome as I remember it.\n\nIf you are a fan of RTS games and Star Wars then this is a must buy. The game plays just like AOE2. Many considered this an official mod when it first came out because of how similar it is and that isn't a bad thing at all since AOE2 is still played and enjoyed by many to this day.\n\nYou get the base game and expansion so you'll have plenty of campaign missions to play through, an unlimited amount of skirmish games, and of course multiplayer. The best thing about the game has to be the ability to play as any of the factions. Yes, you get to play as the Rebel Alliance or the Galactic Empire, but you can also play as the Naboo, Trade Federation, Wookies etc. Each side has it's own units which look and feel different.\n\nI highly recommend this game to any RTS fans.

I have a cd version of this but like having a discless version to take on trips, now I have one more game to take on the road with my laptop. As for the review part:\n\nMade on the same engine Age of Empires II, Star Wars Galaxies acts the same with with just a few differences. Maps, Units, and Gameplay act the same, but with a Space Motif. Unlike Age of Empires each unit has a unique style and look giving different style for each faction. There is even flying units that can go around all terrain allowing you to find hidden units and special easter eggs on several maps in the campaigns. I remember enjoying finding the characters from the movies and using them on the maps I found them to win the game. Though I am against cheating in games it is something neat to note that in Singleplayer you can find cheats that spawn units like the Death Star.\n\nThe game has aged well and even though it is a little buggy in this version to get running I find with a little help from the community guides and forums I have it running and without using a CD. Like all older games it just takes patience and a little know how to get things to work and this game is worth it.\n\nSo to wrap up this review it is a gem to find it on Steam. If you enjoy Real Time Strategy games and are willing to work to get it to run on a modern computer you will not be disappointed. I suggest installing the patch from the community guides to get it to run without messing with stuff in the installation folder.","March 11","true","20.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was awesome when it was first made and it still is awesome now... just do not buy the Steam version unless you want to waste ALOT of time trying to get it to work.\n\nP.S. I have seen comments about this needing a HD release and I entirely disagree because we all know how the HD releases turn out and then are never resolved themselves, (cough Age of Mythology HD cough,) so lets just stick to ports that do not work, and not remake them for $30-$50 of crap that still does not work.\n\nSo there you have it.

I got this game off Humble Bundle and I still feel ripped off.)\n\nNot what this platform used to be. Do not buy a copy of this and do not support these dodgy sales practices.\nIf they want to sell these old gems they can make them work first or they can give them away because this port is utter trash that is in no way made to work in 2016.

It follows the classic format of Age of Empires II with some notable differences - from the cosmetic overhaul to the fact that basic infantry have blasters instead of swords - that make it stand out. These differences allow for a variety of viable strategies, from converting everything your enemy treasures with Jedi/Sith to creating an impregnable fortress and slowly expanding.\n\nThe AI is very retro in the sense that it's not metaphorically drooling on the floor. When I set campaign difficulty to hard, I forgot that it would actually pose a challenge and accidentally lost the man I needed to protect. When I set a standard game's difficulty to normal, I forgot that is normal for someone acquainted with the nature of the game and got mauled for being rusty.\n\nThere's a campaign for each faction. No, not just a campaign: a fully-voiced campaign. It can definitely get cheesy, but it's fun nonetheless.\n\nThe campaign isn't the main chunk of gameplay, though. It's mostly in the standard mode, which generates a map and offers an array of game modes that can even be played in singleplayer. If this isn't enough and you have a bit of a creative spark, there's an extensive map editor that allows for the placement of every prop, unit, and building in the game. It comes with the tools to make your creation feel less like a handmade map and more like a homemade campaign (such as modifying unit stats, changing possession of buildings, and even setting new win/loss conditions).\n\nSo far, all of this has been positive.  It's hard to be unbiased when you grew up on it. However, here's some things I've noticed that were a little offputting:\n\n• The multiplayer matchmaking is long dead. There is a LAN function, but I haven't tested its functionality. I'd assume it still works.\n• Graphics settings are limited, offering low, medium, and high settings and a selection of three 4:3 resolutions. There's no 4K, 2K, or even 1080p support (officially).\n• Steam overlay doesn't appear to work.\n• Yousa might not be liken hearen da proud talk of da goongan people! it's my guilty pleasure\n\ntl;dr\nIf you haven't played it before and you like classic RTSes and Star Wars, you can't really go wrong with this entry. Just know that this isn't some fancy shmancy HD remaster; it's the same game that came out on November 9th, 2001.","March 1","true","8.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you love Star Wars or just RTS' in general, this is a game you will enjoy playing. Expect Age of Empires style mechanics and a wide variety of units designed to bring the pain. Quick note regarding the lore/canon - this game was made BEFORE Revenge of the Sith came out so the canonical sins can be forgiven (Most of the time the game simply glosses over the events of RotS anyway).\n\nHowever, if you do not wish to mess around in the game files DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It has been released in a horrific state:\n1. You cannot launch it from Steam. For whatever reason, the Steam targeted executable only plays the opening movies and thats it (Workaround - simply rename 'Player.exe' to anything else and rename 'battlegrounds_x1.exe' to 'Player.exe').\n2. The Clone Campaigns expansion does not work from the get-go. You have to find a patched version of the 'battlegrounds_x1.exe' online and replace the old one with it (Just search 'clone campaigns no cd patch' and grab version 1.1).\n3. The music files are all missing, so there is no in-game music (menu music only). No idea whether that was deliberate or not but you can always have YouTube running whilst playing).\n4. Without a widescreen patch the max resolution is 1280x720. Even with widescreen patches it's not 100% 1080p but its the best that can be done.\n5. On newer OS' (I say 'newer', I mean Windows Vista and up) the DirectDraw render is bugged awfully. You need to patch the executable (again, I know) in order to get colours to work correctly (sometimes the game won't even start at all unless you patch it).\n\nIt's in a pretty poor state right now but the Discussions forums are really helpful. You shouldn't have to put in more than 10 minutes fixing time to get it to work.\n\nFinal Note: I have received reports that this game cannot be refunded for whatever reason. It's a risk you'll have to take.\n\nSo, in conclusion, this game is excellent to play but you'll need to invest your own time in order to get to that point. I do reviews based on my own experience and fun I've had already outweighs the initial tinkering I had to do to get the game to work.","March 2","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was extremely excited to have found it again and finally be able to relive those moments.\n\nI was immediately greeted with familiar sights and sounds from all of those years ago, the child in me practically yelling with joy at the sights of battle droid armies and storm troopers blasting wookies... but something was missing...\n\nUnfortunately in the recent port of the game (for whatever reason) the military unit hotkeys are completely missing. Those formation buttons, patrol, guard, etc that were so important to good management of your military are simply missing. Furthermore the hotkeys assigned to the aforementioned buttons simply don't work.

After a while army building might seem tedious with resource gathering, but make use of those upgrades to remedy that. And I would have liked to see another Star Wars faction instead of Gungans. But I am very pleased with this game. For $2.99 with the Star Wars Day sale (May 4th) I cannot complain. It holds up well and the graphics are comparable to today's mobile game graphics.

This game was beyond amazing then, and still holds up today.\n\nIt's a little wonky, being so old, but there are community-made patches for some of the issues. A few of the patches introduce a few issues of their own, but they're beyond minor.\n\nThis game, is summed up in this short sentence:\n\nAge of Empires: Star Wars Edition.\n\nYep, that's this game. But it has a helluva lot more to it than that, such as improved AI (sometimes), more units, civs, and structures, including air-units, new map-making materials, such as making space-stations, asteroids, or cloud cities. and new, unique campaigns of never-before-seen stories taking place in the timelines of Episodes I, II, IV, V, and VI, because III hadn't even begun filming at the time of this game's release.\n\nThe game is solid, if a bit aged. The graphics leave much to be desired, but if you're playing this game for the graphics, you're playing for the wrong reasons. The voice-acting, for an early 2000's game, is superb. The game is nearly bug-free, and the few ones can be fixed with the All In One Patch mod.\n\nAlso, this game was recently patched to run on Windows 10, so those of you with newer computers who want to relive your childhood, or those that sadly didn't have one, this game is now available for you!\n\nAlso, 6 bucks when not on sale? How can you go wrong for 6 bucks or less?\n\nThis game, even without my fond nostialgia, is by far one of my all-time favorite games I've ever played, and likely will remain so. To hell with all these new games, I'm going to be bingeing on Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds for months!\n\nSeriously, if you've got 6 bucks, get this amazing game, I cannot stress how much fun this thing is, and if you're strapped for hard-drive space, the install isn't even a full gig, and the download is only around 600MB. Even with the All In One Patch, the game is still barely around 1 gig.\n\nGreat game, and if you're looking to play multiplayer, you can download GameRanger and still find a quite active playerbase to this day!","May 9","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nostalgia heaven aside, the game plays very well, despite its age. The AI is still challenging, and it is still possible (through 3rd party sources, GameRanger for me), to play online with other people. It is completely worth it, especially at this low of a price. Anybody who enjoyed Age of Empires for the mechanics will enjoy SWGB, and those who love both AoE and Star Wars will enjoy this little gem of the past. Not one crash for me, nor any other bugs. The game itself seems to be running perfectly.\n\nPlease note that the in-game multiplayer setup is outdated, and does currently require GameRanger or some other 3rd party to play online, to the best of my knowledge. (These other methods are really easy to use, also very accessible on Google.) Be aware that this is not being sold as an HD remaster or remake, simply a re-release with compatibility on newer machines. I don't know if they will update the multiplayer, graphics, etc., or not.\n\nHighly recommended. Put almost twenty hours on it in less than three days and I plan on playing much more again.","May 14","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Perhaps is what now seems like a very, very basic AI, almost dumb, where all that changes seem to be the amount of units the AI sends to attack you, and they wont even engage you until they reach the point where they were told to attack, what allows you to kill them all when they are just stupidly walking towards your base; or perhaps the fact that all races can be played the same with the same units where all that changes is the design of the unit, and a bunch of unique traits and units, but other than that it's a very lazy unit/race design.
