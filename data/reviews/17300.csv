"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/17300/","miyumiayase","Miyumi Ayase","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/","288 products in account","TL:DR? See Conclusion\nNOTE: I originally finished the game using my disc based copy of the game bought in 2007. I bought it again on steam because it was included in the Crysis Franchise Pack.\n\nINTRODUCTION:One of the rare PC Exclusive titles to break free from the Console's restrictive and dated hardware. Crysis 1 was the benchmark for most PC games back in 2007 until it was finally replaced by Metro 2033 in 2010.\n\nCrysis follows the story of Jake "Nomad" Dunn, member of a Delta Ops Nano Team tasked with infiltrating an Island currently occupied by North Korean Forces. Not soon after landing, the Delta team finds out that the KPA is the least of their worries.\n\nPROS:+ Cutting Edge Graphics: -Considering this game was released in 2007, Crysis can still go toe-to-toe with the 2012 game Far Cry 3. Back then, almost 95% of all PCs in the world could not run Crysis on its maximum settings. Crysis 1 was meant to be a PC only exclusive mostly because the developers really wanted to push both their creative freedom and raw hardware power. This is the game also spawned the internet meme: "But can it run Crysis?"\n\n+ Innovative Gameplay: -This game was the first to introduce the Nano Suit which added a wide variety of new approaches to missions and objectives. A Quick hand and good reflexes are needed to fully utilize the Nano Suit's power.\n\n+ Pseudo Open World: -Its not Sandbox, but it's not linear. Each mission objective involves a map of gigantic proportions where you can go and carefully plan out your strategy before going in a mission. Like what I said in my SW: Republic Commando Review, not every game needs to be sandbox. Crysis 1 had a good style by giving enough freedom while keeping the player in a directed flow in the story.\n\nCONS:- Terrible Optimization: -Although it was the Graphical Flagship of its time, the devs mainly focused on sheer brute force power of the GPU but made so little optimization. If properly optimized, most mid-range PCs could have ran this game a bit better.\n\n- Unresolved Bugs: -6 years and some of the bugs from the first release still persists. Downloading some of the latest patches actually causes a bug. Not game breaking but terribly annoying.\n\n- Resolution Problem: -You may or may not encounter this problem but the game seems to have a problem doing a full screen with a 1920x1080 resolution. To fix this, you'll need to edit the settings via note pad.\n\nCONCLUSION:MUST HAVE. One of the landmark games that dared a primarily Console dominated market to shine a great light once more to the PC.\n\nAdditional Note: This is not a fast paced action game like COD or Battlefield. This game actually requires some planning and tactical movements to get the job done, specially in some of the harder difficulties.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nosayso/recommended/17300/","nosayso","NoSaySo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nosayso/","208 products in account","This game is well-known for being beautiful, but to desribe it only as eye candy really sells Crysis short.  There's a lot to enjoy about the gameplay, especially how it breaks up the old "series of chest-high-walls" shooter formula.\n\nAs a super soldier your suit contains a variety of powers that can be toggled between:  super strength (enhancing melee abilities), super speed, maximum armor, and active camouflage (which makes you truly invisible to enemies who haven't seen you yet).  Active camo is the true selling point, learning to use it (and honestly, abuse it) is what keeps you alive.  Your character is not well suited for going in guns blazing, you'll rely on stealth and run-and-gun tactics against enemies who prefer to hunt you instead of bunkering down behind a chest high wall.  In general, human enemy AI is fantastic and pushes you to quickly learn how to survive a Crysis fire-fight.\n\nWeapons customization is another well-done aspect of Crysis.  The same gun can be customized to a short/medium range spray-and-pray style semi-automatic, or a long-range silenced sniper with a scope and laser sight, all pretty much on-the-fly.  So while the number of unique weapons is actually pretty small (5 or 6 maybe), you can get a lot more mileage out of them through customization.\n\nWhile the first stretch of the game fighting human enemies is very fun, the game has an abrupt change when you begin to encounter mostly aliens.  I definitely found this part much less enjoyable, it seems more about showing what you can do with the Cry Engine than keeping the game fun for the player.  My level of interest dropped off pretty sharply, to the extent that I didn't even finish the game.\nThat doesn't mean I'm not glad I bought it (I definitely still recommened it), and you may not have the same experience I had.","November 25, 2013","true","28.5"," 54 of 60 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","54","60","0","0"

There were numerous glitches, audio issues and frequent CTDs.\n\nBut you know what? Putting the technical difficulties aside this is a damn fine game! You play Nomad, a special forces soldier who wears a so-called nanosuit. The story takes place in the future and the objective is to find out what happened on the island previously seized by Koreans.\n\nWhile you traverse through the deep jungle and small settlements you notice two things: the game is stunningly beautiful (there was a reason for the high system reqs) and that by hiding-shooting you cannot eliminate your foes. You need to utilise your nanosuit.\n\nYou can bring up a special menu and select from various abilities. Speed makes you faster, Strength allows you to melee your foes or throw bigger objects and Stealth makes you invisible. All drain your energy bar (which will refill automatically, but slowly) and I do not have to mention that Stealth is the most exciting and most useful among all. Oh, yes, there's a 4th power enabling you to take more damage.\n\nEnemy AI is great - they respond to the noises, work in squads and will try to find you even if you are invisible. On greater difficulty settings they speak Korean so you do not understand what commands they give to one another.\n\nOccasionally, the game throws in some scripted cutscenes - these look good and also interesting. By looking at the pictures on the store page one can guess what they'll find (and what the army was really looking into), but let's not spoil it here.\n\nCrysis is a stunningly beautiful game (even today considering it's more than 5 years old) and makes for an interesting, action-packed ride.\n\nWARNING: This review is based on playing the game on a 32-bit operating system. As per the feedbacks on the store page and amongst the discussions people detail further issues when it comes to 64-bit systems. I understand there is a workaround which has been tried and found good, still, this is just to let you know that before the purchase you should look into this.","December 21, 2014","true","3.2"," 41 of 45 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","41","45","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/andyone/recommended/17300/","andyone","ANDY 1 HARDCORE  [UK]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/andyone/","290 products in account","I've never ever felt so confused about rating something I have just finished. At the moment I'm talking about story and its side of game because other parts of game (which we'll be talking next) are perfect.\n\nOn the release date (2007) was this game truly revolutionary. In that time game's graphic was something unbelieveable. And still when we're comparing nowadays games or games from at least from 2010+ we can see, that Crysis is still next step above them and not in graphic, but in whole gameplay, even stealth and sometimes AI. This game is damn 7 YEARS OLD for God's sake and still nowadays developers are not even able to put their games to level Crysis was in 2007 which's really unbelieveable.\n\nMy PERSONAL opinion is, that if there weren't aliens and SCI-FI side, it'd be one of the best FPS games ever been made. At the moment I got my hands on my head, and thinking of words which could describe the first hours of game. Alright, I'll divide this game to 2 parts ... 1st with Koreans and 2nd with Aliens. If the whole game was only about Koreans .... I still have no idea why they've put Aliens in it... Just because they had to think of new story ? Ridicolous, since the story flew 5 hours without problem and without mentioning Aliens... They really have could let it in only.\n\nThere was mentioned stealth, so let's take a look on it. It's really different, than in nowadays games. Now, when you hide into creek or tree, or just some textures which obviously should cover you, you're automatically spotted because in source code they're just textures, but in Crysis somehow you was able to cover in creek or tree and enemy could be few feets away from you, and he didn't spot you which's realistic I'd say. But of course only if you stood still. If you made a move, he could hear you obviously, so also as I said AI is pretty good made here. When you're in firefight, they won't rush you, they'll wait for you, throwing grenades on you, but in open field, they wan't to crush you from sides which really doesn't matter since you got Nanosuit...\n\nMultiplayer is totally dead. No wonder when this game is 7 years old. Still you can find servers with 30+ players, but only sometimes, and they're different version than Steam version (Servers for cracked copies) and there are only 10 servers for Steam version which're empty and when there is someone, he's cheater anyway. MP won't change rating.\n\nTo the end let's say, apart from fact there're Aliens it's still awesome, great, brilliant, and one of the best FPS ever been made, but not BEST. Crytek always knew how to make games (not these days .. NOTE: F2P). The ending was one of the worst I have ever encounter. Ending of game took me 10 hours in total and parts with Aliens was like 3+ hours.\n\n8/10 (Perfect)","March 29, 2014","true","10.4"," 69 of 90 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","69","90","0","4"

Based on the Cry Engine 2, even now it is absolutely stunning.\n\nBut more importantly its actually a brilliant game all round. The story is pretty standard, you are a special force operative kitted out with a "Nano Suit" which allows you to perform as a super soldier, whilst on mission you discover an Alien species which are plotting to invade the world (or so it seems). Voice acting is pretty good, the facial mapping is OUTSTANDING!\n\nBut the key point that won this game for me was the true freedom it provides you in how you play. The map is very open, leaving it up to the player how you approach each objective. You can switch your suit to max armour and plow straight through the next check point murdering people left right and centre... you could turn on your optic camoflage and sneak through without a soul knowing, you could buff your strength, pick up an explosive barrel, hurl it at the building and watch the Crytek physics bring the roof down upon your foes.

I upgraded my (7 year old) PC earlier this year, and therefore Crysis finally became playable for me. Because, let's be honest, a game like this should be played maxed out. So I picked it up at a recent discount on Steam, but was it worth the long wait?\n\nI really enjoyed the game, but from time to time it really got me frustrated as well. I struggled with the checkpoint system of the game a bit, but maybe that's because I'm not used to it. Ultimately, I have a good feeling after finishing it and that is the most important factor for me.\n\nAnno 2013, Crysis still is a stunningly beautifull game, and you no longer need extra-terrestrial hardware to play this game on very high settings. However, the last level is very demanding on the system, and I had to run the game in DirectX 9 mode to be able to stay above 60FPS (just add -dx9 as a startup argument).\n\nSo, all in all, do I recommend this game... yes (if you can pick it up a at a discounted price of course).","December 22, 2013","true","13.4"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","32","34","0","0"

Actually the only reason I bought this was because I got a new PC that actually can play games and, with Crysis having once been "that game for crazy good gaming PC's," I decided to check it out for that reason alone.\n\nEven after ~8 years, it's quite a pretty game on max settings. It's also a decent shooter with a giant open world that allows for varied approaches towards completing objectives. But it weakens in the later parts of the game as it becomes more linear and all about fighting off hordes of enemies coming to attack you. Also the ending is kinda abrupt, but I guess they did that so they could cash in on some sequels (and they seem to have done exactly that).\n\nSo... is it worth getting? I guess. It's not a bad game at all, though I can't see myself playing through it again. Play it for curiosity's sake, then put it away. :o\n\n♥♥♥♥ EA.","May 14, 2015","true","8.6"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","94","30","32","9","0"

While the player faces Korean soldiers and research facilities , an alien ship prepares to emerge and begin the invasion of Earth . Nomad  faces Korean forces and tries to defeat the alien threat . The game submerges us under incredibly detailed rainforests. The physics of the game is excellent . Apart from the story, one enjoys walking around the environment , breaking the palms, catching animals, piloting boats , swimming with fish , and driving around the islands.\n\nThe graphics engine is the successor to Far Cry . It was a real revolution in real-time graphics . The image quality and texture is still among the best of all time . This makes the game very immersive . It took five years after release to play the game with very high quality settings and get  a reasonable experience. Many people spoke at the time of bad optimization when in fact the game has three times more polygons than his contemporaries , volumetric clouds , day- night phases and huge maps. Nothing compared to the fixed pixelated sky on a Call of Duty game .\n\nThe player has a special suit that gives different powers or abilities for a period of time, such as invisibility , speed or armor. While it is not a Sandbox, it has  open maps that simulate the world much better than its very linear successor, Crysis 2. In that regard, it is even better than Crysis 3.\n\nThe game was one of the best action games of 2007 but did not have many sales due to high specifications, hardware requirements and DirectX 10. It has two Secuels . Crysis 2 and Crysis 3 .\nWhile Crysis 3 surpasses some of its graphic , 1 remains the best game of the 3 .\n\nThe game was released for Windows PC , PS3 and XBOX 360 before being ported to MAC OSX.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nESPAÑOL\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCrysis es un videojuego de disparos en primera persona desarrollado por Crytek y distribuido por Electronic Arts en 2007.\n\nUn grupo de elite viaja a Corea del Norte a investigar un artefacto. Mientras que el jugador se enfrenta a soldados coreanos e investiga instalaciones, una nave alienígena se prepara para emerger y comenzar la invasión de la tierra. Jake Nomad deberá enfrentarse a las fuerzas coreanas y alienígneas para intentar derrotarlas. El juego nos lleva por selvas tropicales increiblemente detalladas. La física del juego es excelente. Al margen de la historia uno disfruta de pasear por el entorno, romper las palmeras, agarrar animales, pilotar lanchas, nadar con peces y manejar vehículos por las islas.\n\nEl motor gráfico es el sucesor del Far Cry. Fue una verdadera revolución en cuanto a gráficos en tiempo real. La calidad de imagen y texturas sigue estando entre las mejores de todos los tiempos. Esto hace al juego muy inmersivo. Recién después de cinco años pudo jugarse el juego con la calidad máxima activada y una experiencia razonable. Mucha gente habló en su momento de mala optimización cuando en realidad el juego tenia tres veces mas polígonos que sus contemporaneos, nubes volumétricas, fases dia - noche y mapas enormes. Nada que ver con el cielo pixelado y fijo de un Call of Duty.\n\nEl jugador posee un traje especial que le confiere poderes especiales por un lapso de tiempo, como la invisibilidad, la velocidad o armadura. Si bien no es un Sandbox posee mapas que simulan un mundo abierto mucho mejor que su muy lineal sucesor, el Crysis 2.\n\nEl juego fue uno de los mejores juegos de acción de 2007 aunque no tuvo muchas ventas debido a las altas especificaciones y el requerimiento de DirectX 10 para aprovecharlo al máximo. Posee dos seculas. El Crysis 2 y el Crysis 3.\nSi bien el Crysis 3 lo supera en algunos de sus aspectos gráficos, el 1 sigue siendo el mejor de los 3.\n\nEl juego se lanzó para PC bajo Windows, PS3 y XBOX 360 para luego ser portado a MAC OSX.","November 25, 2013","true","26.8"," 39 of 52 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","39","52","0","0"

This was truly ahead of it's time. Of course, there are some minor flaws which are commonly seen in first-person open world games, mainly problems with the enemies being dumb as soup cans even on difficulties above easy. But, in defense, the game was made to be eyecandy and not to be a gameplay masterpiece. Still, the stealth, the weapons, the vehicles, the open world and the missions all make Crysis most certainly worth it's price tag. Also, you're best off getting the maximum edition, because it includes Crysis Warhead, which just adds to the experience. So, despite it's flaws, I give Crysis a solid 9.5/10.","November 25, 2013","true","11.2"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","28","35","0","0"

Naturally, since I played this in 2014, my perspective on the game will be very different from the one who played it when it came out. But only an hour into the game, I realized why people call it such a revolutionary shooter for its time. I didn't play with any mods, yet I would've never guessed the game I was playing came out in 2007 judging from what it presented to me. This is due to the following reasons:\n\n- The vastness of the world and the graphical fidelity are overwhelmingly impressive for an FPS title this old. You can clearly see that the CryEngine is designed to push the limits on what's possible in terms of looks and scope. I was impressed by how open-world-y the terrain is, yet the missions are unmistakably straightforward... which turns out to be an incredibly fun combination in my opinion. Being dropped on a tropical island where you shoot people in a vast and open area offering multiple ways of approaching your goals is to my mind a great way to design an FPS. The level of detail is stunning to say the least for a 2007 title, I have seen much worse in considerably newer titles.\n\n- The gunplay, gun variety and AI are simply great. Shooting enemies feels fun, feels rewarding and feels challenging since the AI actively tries to hunt you down when you for example sneaked away again using cloak. One of the core mechanics, the exosuit and its accompanying suit powers offer great variety for both people who like to be stealthy or those who love to cause mayhem. I found a mix of these to be the most effective and entertaining. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it I think I never experienced as much satisfaction as when I blew up a truck with a rocket launcher while crouching in a bush with cloak engaged. The effects are mindblowing, as are the sound assets, just really immersive overall.\n\n- Performance is solid. With CFX 7950/7970 I easily manage 60fps, except for very intense scenes involving lots of explosions and stuff. FoV seems to be exceptionally high, I didn't see a slider for it in the menu, but it's at least 100 by default, which is great. Sadly there's a few bugs involving for example scripted events and cutscenes not triggering correctly when loading from quicksaves amidst a level, nothing game-breaking though. Also, 1920x1080 or higher resolution is not enabled by default, you have to manually adjust it in the config file, which is no big deal though.\n\n- The level design is interesting enough. While most levels feature open tropical island terrain with hilly, foresty areas, there's also a sequence where you are in weightless space, floating around inside a gigantic alien structure; very impressive and intriguing overall. The enemy variety is great too: From your usual infantry of all kind to jeeps, tanks, helicopters, boats to rather pesky flying alien crystalline squids with fast-firing energy weapons to a huge ♥♥♥ alien motherfugger in the process of sinking a motherfuggin aircraft carrier. It should be noted that you can drive jeeps, tanks, boats and helicopters yourself which is super fun if you like to shoot up stuff in the most classy way imaginable.\n\nNegative points? I have one major one, but perhaps it's not really valid since the game clearly doesn't focus on that aspect at all and never pretends to:\n\nThe story is mindblowingly clichée and superficial: >Technologically augmented super soldier infiltrates fictional island under the control of evil North Koreans, gathers intel, blows up stuff, uncovers archeological project gone overboard, sleeping alien entity that feeds itself off energy awakens, causes major destruction, gruffy American general wants to drop nuke on island to kill off the monstrosity, super-intelligent scientists who always know it better advise against it, alien gets nuked anyway, becomes massively stronger, protagonist has to beat XXL format version of alien monstrosity using lots of missiles and a super secret prototype weapon which had never been field-tested but works like a charm (why wouldn't it?), escapes a sinking aircraft carrier and goes right back into the fight because he's a badass and a superhuman, dutiful soldier-tough-guy who has no fear and throughout the entire game requires no sleep at all.\nThere, that's the plot in a nutshell for you. Not really intentended in the beginning but hey, these are spontaneous and minimally structured reviews after all so w/e.\nSo there you go, awesome FPS, don't play it for the story, play it for the mechanics and the looks. This is how every modern military shooter should be. You can make a very linear, bland narrative without sacrificing diversity and creativity in terms of gameplay and mechanics. Crysis taught us this.\n\nNo score here, read the damn review if you care for my opinion on it.","November 16, 2014","true","10.9"," 29 of 37 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","29","37","3","0"

If you miss games that simply put you in an environment, gave you some objectives, and let you figure out how to do them without driving you down a rollercoaster, the original Crysis is arguably the last and most technically advanced game of this type to be developed. The visual achievements of the CryEngine have overshadowed the fact that this game, well most of it at least, is a shining example of objective-based game design released just before everyone took shooters in the complete opposite direction.\n\nThe first level, which is shown off in the demo that’s available at crysisdemo.com as of this writing, is a perfect example of this. In a small bay occupied by a few enemy fortifications along the shore and some motorboat patrols, Crysis gives you two main objectives and an optional objective to tackle in any order. You can work your way along the coastline through the forts, take over a boat to zip around the bay, or whatever, through any combination of stealth and assault tactics.\n\nThis continues through the next several levels which are sort of a linear chain of small sandboxes: a village you can infiltrate from multiple angles, a group of bases along a river, a harbor, and so-on. The level design in all these areas is quite good, always giving you options and setups for fire fights that never happen the same way twice. This is even true in the game’s more linear sections early on. In the early parts (more on that later), even when Crysis is a corridor it’s still a very wide corridor.\n\nI think the best way to describe the core game mechanics would be to call Crysis a simulation based on the original 1987 Predator movie. Your tools are Schwarzenegger-esque explosions and futuristic super powers. The nanosuit let’s you choose between super armor (the default), increased running speed, and a temporary stealth cloak. You’ll probably use the cloak the most but the other powers offer potential for fun combinations and interesting choices. Super strength let’s you jump higher, and you can combine it with speed for running super jumps. When sniping you can choose between staying hidden with the cloak or using strength for a more stable shooting arm.\n\nBehind the nanosuit the Crysis boasts a varied sandbox of shooter mechanics. Not only is there the ever-present option of stealth, but you can also lift and throw most objects at enemies and control various vehicles. Most buildings in the game are also dynamically destructible through the physics engine, which feels like it has a tangible effect on gameplay. Crysis even let’s you fit most weapons with a modest variety of attachments with a quick tap of the C key like different sights or a silencer.\n\nThe reason you might hear a lot of people praise Crysis by saying “the first half” or “the first two thirds” of the game, is because for some reason it turns into a different, much worse game at a specific point later on. The later sections of Crysis are far more linear and introduce gameplay mechanics that while unique, just don’t work that well.  It’s probably best if you stop playing when you start a boss fight with a North Korean general. The most succinct thing I can say is at that point it feels like the level designers ran out of gas.\n\nThe good parts of Crysis though will still net you at least around 10 hours of gameplay, and that’s just for one run. I consider Crysis to be a pretty replayable game just because you can approach its missions with multiple strategies, but also because each difficulty mode above normal changes things considerably.\n\nOn normal you can pretty much toy with enemies using the nanosuit. On hard you can still play with them a little bit, but you have to be smart about it. Higher difficulties change a few core mechanics, and the deadlier enemies ensure you have to rethink the way you use the cloak and cover. Hard and Delta mode almost turn Crysis into a straight-up stealth game.\n\nOf course what Crysis is most well-known for is the “but can it run Crysis?” joke pertaining to the game’s harsh treatment of processors. Even after six years, Crysis is not an extremely easy game to run. My GTX 760 still only get’s 60 frames per second MOST of the time in 1080p. The consumer experience when you first install the game doesn’t make things easier either.\n\nBeing from the early days of DirectX 10, Crysis forces it on you by artificially locking the highest graphics features behind DX10 when they are in fact available on DX9 just by editing the ini file or downloading a custom one. DX10 does little more than drag down performance of the already demanding Crysis.\n\nIf you’re wondering if Crysis still holds up visually after six years, I think with vanilla settings it’s beginning to show its age, but still looks significantly better than most console games released in even the last couple years. Really, only the highest-end recent PC games (Crysis 3, Metro, Battlefield 4), and next-gen-console-only launch games like Killzone Shadow Fall beat it. It can still look impressive with custom ini files and texture packs though.\n\nI think it’s kind of a crime Crysis got labled as just “that really pretty PC game nobody can run.” In my opinion it’s one of the most underrated first person shooters of this past console generation (it did come out on consoles eventually after all), if not one of the best. It’s one of the last, if not the last of a breed of shooter that game designers seemingly forgot in the chase after Call of Duty’s popularity.","December 31, 2013","true","11.0"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

Mostly because of its Sandbox-like Gameplay. Fast first person shooter, or silent stealth game, or BOTH! Improvise or use tactic methods; weapon mods or the abillities of your armor. Get a vehicle, fill it with explosives and drive it into an enemy outpost, no problem. Throw your surrounding objects, like crates, barrels, refrigerators, chickens, at your enemies or destroy little houses. You can play as you like and the game doesn't punish you for it.\nI, for my part, didn't like they stealth gameplay though, it's quite hard if you really want to sneak through without an alarm going off. I like it more as an action game where most effort was put in.\nBesides your "one man- army" missions, you can take a seat in a tank battle, a helicopter escort mission or survive in an arctic world, fighting from fire to fire to keep yourself warm.\nIt is great in every aspect of a game, not superior to most games today has to offer, but still...\n\nAnd a short word to the multiplayer:\nAlthough the GameSpy servers were shut down, it's still possible to play the multiplayer via a Mod created from the community.\n\nConclusion\n\nRating: Very Good -> After all a wonderful shooter, varied, good-looking and just fun to play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KyleAdder/recommended/17300/","KyleAdder","Slade Wilson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KyleAdder/","110 products in account","~Maximum Review~\n\nThis Action-FPS game was released back in November, 2007. But at the time it had some of the best graphics ever for a game of its kind! The main reason behind this was the kickass-German made Crytek engine that used a heavy demand on graphics cards at the time to present lots of new features. Does crytek sound familiar at all? if it does-that is because they also created the first far cry game waay back in 2004!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=687933321\nThese kinds of games typically have big expanses of various maps and consists of stealth missions near the start and middle sections but blooms into a beautiful action-set experience with lots of options! (Even some optional quests!). Crysis was no different and delivered a great action game with many new useful features/gameplay mechanics that more than made up for simpified story sequences, crappy nano-suit power (It is the damn future!) and some really dumb AI.\nAnyway i dont want to list everything this game offers here! instead ill chop it into clean little pieces and serve you....The Pros and Cons.\n\nPros:+SO many awesome small little additions to gameplay that make a big difference! Some of these include: Your PC's battery level shown, lots more graphics and weapon options at the time, Minimap accuracy with coordinates,  enhanced physics and a deadly shark to stop people from leaving the map! A frickin shark!!\n+I really liked the Abilities FOR the nanosuit, but not the Nanosuit itself (Because of numerous energy reasons that ill describe in Cons below) The Cloak, Speed and Strength are used regularly, and for good reason!\n+The Story is very strong and warhead fits in very well. The Title really fits the plot! and the "Futuristic spelling" helps a little bit too i guess. No Purposeful emotional scenes or anything  like that, its an action game dammit! Shoot Cephs first and ask questions later!.But the story has got some great seperation between the stealth and action sequences! A calm cutscene to recap what big event just occured, followed by a guerilla-style trespass on an enemy base is a great mix! Basicsally what im trying to say is that the Pacing in this game is very well done.\n+The Vehicles some of which include: A tank, a Vtol jet, a Military jeep and military dinghyhandle very well surprisingly and are easy to control, speaking of that...\n+The tutorial is hardly a tuturial and just a slow part of the story that just happens to teach you the controls. Which are simple and very easy to change! (Loads of settings means more gameplay styles to suit more people=potential larger audience)\n+Map is big and cut into sections, but that doesnt really matter as you traverse most of the area with ease. Missions take you to several different locations some of which include: A Dense Tropical Forest, a Launch Site, Dig sites, Tank battleground (Large Clearing with airdrops) and even an Aircraft carrier! Dont classify this as an open world game at all! It is very linear like Basically all FPS shooters. It just has a big map for a few missions then changes it for a smaller, denser one And Repeats often.\n+Weapons are quite realistic and have noticeable effects with mixed with the nano-suits abilities! Bullpup rifles will have more recoil than the generic AK-47 found often and it will effect your aiming long distance!\n+The Way the Story transforms into the action packed shooter with various sci-fi elements attatched it amazing! If you asked me at the start of the game how i thought it would end, i would give a very different answer. But this is good! It means that the story will keep you guessing often while it introduces new Things to you.\n+I couldnt talk about the pros without mentioning the Graphics that it possesses, it is has lots of technical features that i could fill the list with but instead ill give you this  Link[dsogaming.com] Basically with mods it can run at 8k 60fps and all that good stuff. But remember this is extremely specific to most people. Depends if you care enough about it to mod the games really. But without it, it is definetely impressive\n+Enemies are difficult at times, and can be placed in such environments to even give some peope a fright!\n+Speaking of Difficulty...Try Delta! it really changes the game and makes you appreciate corners and baricades more than parts of the environment!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=687933511\nCons:-Below-average boss battles, with repetitive strategies to defeat them. Especially at the end!Also i found myself restarting plenty of time because i didnt understand how to beat them clearly!\n-The AI in this game is quite dumb and found some soliders running into walls, ignoring me throwing grenades and even firing their guns randomly! (Who are they recruiting?).\n-The games "maps" are surprisingly linear as i said above and you are contantly reminded of this if you go slight too far away from the beach, or from a checkpoint, etc.\n-Nanosuit is so Underpowered. The features are great and well thought out, but due to the double A batteries of the suit most of the abilities run out after about 5-10 seconds! Running is definetely the worst offender, because it is one of the most useful mechanics in the game (And would have made speedrunning quite easy!) it is just sapped away by the energy so quickly! This might not seem too important to some people, but remember if you are in a fire-fight with enemies and you just used a different Ability (eg.Cloak-Mode) your energy will be sapped and if you need to make a inhumanly-quick escape...you can see where this is going.\n-Most of the Map is just jungle with beach attatched! it gets so boring after a little while and you always look for a car to drive quickly to the next location because you dont want to take a slow walk and "Enjoy" whats on offer. Because there really isnt much! although it may look very beautiful and all, it is not dense at all (Full with structures or unique features) much like Just Cause 1, 2 and 3! Although this is a linear shooter at the end of the day, it feels like in some sequences, its trying to awkwardly change that!\n-Lots of Glitches (Obviously! no game is perfect..) that affect the game's graphics and also a crappy save system which, although being very manual to the player, has a very irritating habit of saving before a big battle. Now what would happen if you arrived early to said battle and were already taking lots of damage? Maybe an explosion happens at the last second? Save System: "Go Back 30 mins  to the slow-stealth section please!"\n-Many minor parts of gameplay, controls or even visual effects will obviosuly be beaten by games today. So Ignorant players expecting a Battlefield 4 style Combat system will obviously not recieve it (The Combat/Weapon system and variety develops heavily in the second game!). Not really a Con, more of a "warning". But people know what they can expect now cant they!\n\nFinal Thoughts:I give this game a 9/10! If you even remotely enjoyed Far Cry 1 or even 2, you will love the version with Aliens, futuristic weapons, and various Gameplay Tweaks.\nHighly Recommended for Anyone who likes FPS games in general, Expansive Areas and Sci-Fi Elements.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=640779090","May 9","true","70.2"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","2"

Hardly surprising when all that was talked about was 'Can it Crysis?'.\n\nHowever, I picked it up cheap in 2010 after building a fresh system & wanted to see what it could do.\n\nIt was only when I found I was riveted to the game did I realise that underneither the headline grabbing garphics, was a game that utterly appealled to me; it's a seriously immersive story that holds on to you for hour after hour.\n\nThe game play is excellent, switching suit modes is fast & intuitive, the gun upgrades are all worth considering & best of all you can be gung-ho if you want or you can stealth you way around & not really kill anyone & still acheive the mission objectives, the game simply sets you're objective, then lets you crack on with it, rather than forcing you one way or another, a trait that defines utterly iconic games like Deus-Ex.\n\nThe vehicles handle like boats though, much like Farcry, Crytek's first game & the climax is a little overblown. It's dramatic & exciting, right up until you fight the final 'boss'. However, like Bioshock, the build up is so enjoyable, any final battle is going to feel like an anticlimax.\n\nUltimately, the game ended with me chewing my hands for more, which means that it's succeeded in engrossing me in the world it's creating, which is the one thing I demand. An excellent multiplayer is all well & good, but if a game has a story line, in my mind, it has to stand on that alone or not at all. Crysis doesn't need the graphics or EA's massive marketing department to be a truly noteable game, but it does help make us aware of it.","June 23, 2014","true","31.5"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/recommended/17300/","antwog","Antwog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/","192 products in account","Crysis was a very good game and the first in a great series developed by Crytek and published by Electronic Arts in 2007. Crysis is a science-fiction first person shooter. You, the player, play as Nomad, an exceptional and strong-willed character determined to fight to survive. The game is primarily set on a North-Korean controlled island where they are attempting to uncover the mystery of a potential grand discovery. Nomad and his nano-suited military team mates and the United States army intervene, however the reveal of a greater power, named the Ceph, strongly influences and alters the story.\n\nThis campaign is excellent. The campaign is a great example of a story that starts slow, but builds to a climax. The setting of being on one island suggests a limited campaign, however, the great areas of on the island and in the island create a nice variety of missions. I adore the fluidity and transition between missions within the campaign. For instance, you complete a mission and run to the extraction point - instead of the game taking you to a loading screen, it immediately starts the next mission, which is a massive positive. The only issue I encountered with the campaign is the mild relevance of the side missions. Nomad would have to gain intel from a North Korean camp, and while it adds some further dialogue in the story, it is not substantial. Also, it is really a standalone player game as your squad-members do not assist you in missions and are very useless.\n\nGameplay is your standard first person shooter gameplay, The gameplay is fluid and solid. There is nothing more to elaborate on regarding shooting and cover. Driving is a nice feature but clunky as the vehicle is very sensitive to player controls. The issues I encountered within the gameplay section is the lack of ammo for an American gun and the very small variety of overall guns in the game. I had to rely on a North Korean assault rifle because there was no ammo to be found for my American Scar. There are some minor bugs such as the red dot on a red dot sight not appearing and the insane amount of bullets required to kill an armoured North Korean enemy. To kill an enemy would regularly take 75% of a magazine. To kill an Alien would take a larger amount of ammo, which is understandable as they are strong aliens, but for humans, that is very odd. The main disturbance regarding gameplay is the sheer stupidty of AI. Some enemies would run in circles while ally team mates would be useless in completing objectives, as stated prior.\n\nThe graphics are incredible for a game developed in 2007. Crytek is known as a high-quality graphical company and they really emphasised that in Crysis. While the recommended settings were a Nvidia GT 8800, I could not play at ultra settings, even with my graphics card, which is odd as I had to play on very high settings with V Sync and Anti Aliasing turned off.\n\nOverall, this game is a good game. I only played the campaign and I can safely say I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I played this game in around eight hours. It's a solid length of a game. I recommend the game at the Steam price of $19.99. Furthermore, I would strongly suggest buying the Maximum Edition that includes Crysis, Crysis: Warhead, and Crysis II.\n\nThree aspects in review:\nCampaign: 9/10\nGameplay: 7.25/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nOverall: 8.25/10\n\nThanks for reading my review!

The impassable jungle and sandy beaches, the leaves moving from the slightest breeze, and extremely realistic waves – the magnificent picture bewitches and tempts.

It is necessary to pay for all these "lotions" with energy which, however, is quickly restored. All listed abilities are realized by means of modes: maximum strength (powerful force), maximum speed (allows to fade fast), maximum armor (simply armor) and an invisibility mode (on all fours through the enemy jungle).\nAlso It should be noted possibility of modernization of the weapon: it is possible to fasten a sniper sight, the laser index, the muffler, etc. For the rest the gameplay of Crysis doesn't differ from Far Cry.","March 17, 2014","true","8.2"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","22","32","0","0"

Imagine an FPS that removed most of the stupid cliches of modern FPS games, getting rid of things like "shotguns are short range" and "melee attacks deal 100x damage". When I first hopped into the game, I expected an FPS I would play for 3~ hours and say "eh, it was worth 4 dollars". What I got was a unique experience that left me with a constant desire to replay the game again and again,\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nPlaying a tad like Far Cry (The developers started the series, featuring huge environment and gameplay similarities) or modern MGS, it allows you to approach enemies with a variety of ways with an INSANE ammount of ways to approach it. It isn't like Dishonored (Which I also highly reccomend) where every option feels forced and in your face; I can switch to Strength mode and knock down a hut, then use the curved roof as a ramp to launch myself out of danger by charging at it in speed mode. Encounter a 3 man patrol? pick up the strongest of the group, switch to strength mode, snap his neck and then toss him at another soldier, before finishing off the last one with a bullet to the head or a punch strong enough to instantly incapitate him. Base surrounded by trip mines? single individual guards out, toss them over the wall, and walk away as his body slides over the mines. Cornered by 4 men and using a box as cover? Switch to Strength mode, smash the box with the butt of a shotgun, then have the now flying box incapitate them all. Small radio station on a hill? lure the opposition into a frail building then smash the roof, causing the building to collapse and kill everyone inside. Taking the high ground to scout is beneficial, as in one situation I spotted a car 'bout half a mile off speeding down the road, allowing me to take the chance to shoot out its tires from a long distance, causing the speeding vehicle to go spiraling into a ditch, killing the crew inside. While scouting, I spotted an attack boat surverying a cargo loading zone. As the boat went further down shore, I dove to the bottom of the seabed. As the boat made its approach, I switched to speed mode and swam upward at superhuman speed, sending me a good 20~ feet out of the water... and allowing me to toss a grenade stright into the boat. Armored patrol of 5 getting out of a car? Strength mode, jump to one side, kill the two koreans and shoot the gunner atop the car, then punch the car hard enough to send it spiraling into the remaining Koreans. Catch a DISGUSTING COMMUNIST taking a leak (Enemies actually do this) at a river? hold him underwater until he drowns.\n\nNeedless to say, the game is packed with variety, and even without it, the gunplay, which is phenomenally realistic and enjoyable, would alone make the game worth it.\n\nSTORY:\n\nA bit generic on the outside (Crysis 2 and 3 aren't as good but expanded on the story quite well), Crysis' story is quite good, but certainly not the best feature of the game. SPOILERS AHEAD; Technologically advanced Aliens nicknamed the Ceph are advanced to the point of being able to create anything they can think of; so, they turn their minds to things they cannot think of or predict. They send "Colonization pods" to planets that have the potential to host life, with our world being Pod-ed two-million years before Humanity came to exist. In 1912, Richard Hargreave sets out on an expedition with 3 other individuals to Alaska, where there is rumored "riches". What he and his crew discover, however, is a massive ammount of Ceph Technology. Hargreave's two colleagues are heavily injured in the operation, and using alien tech, he saves their lives with reported super-human abilities. Hargreave, being a genius, founds Hargreave Science Corp, and begins to use Ceph technology to create weapontry and amass a fortune. Sometime between 1990 and 2200, Hargreave begins to fear a Ceph awakening and allies Hargreave Science Corp. and the child company Crynet Systems (Hence why "Crysis" is spelt the way it is) with the United States, giving them acess to Nano-Suit technology.  North Korea discovers and alien colonization pod on the Lang Shian Islands and mobilizes the North Korean People's Army to evacuate the island with the intention of utilizing Alien technology to become most advanced civilization and to defeat the United States. However, their intentions are never fufilled, as two elite Nanosuit teams (Team Raptor, Crysis 1, and Team Eagle, Crysis Warhead) defeat massive ammounts of Korean People Army Forces, and combined with the awakening of the Ceph colonization pod, which the main charecter of Crysis 1, Nomad, enters in an attempt to defeat the Ceph. Realizing his efforts are futile, he attempts to escape the pod, only to be met with a Frozen Wasteland created by the Ceph in an attempt to push out human forces. Nomad, Psycho, and Prophet (Nanosuited Individuals) escape the frozen landscape and rejoin eachother on a U.S Battleship, where Nomad is provided an experimental tactical nuke device, and also where the Captain of the ship fails to realize that Ceph absorb energy, foolishly launching a massive nuclear missle into the massive, frozen dome, causing it to massively expand and to trigger the full force of the Ceph invasion. The Ceph assault the ship, and after defeating a massive alien monster called "The Hunter", the ship is attacked by a gigantic alien battleship, witch sinks the ship and is barely defeated by Nomad. This "Victory" is only a small one in a massive war, with more to come in Crysis 2 and 3 (Honestly, just read about the lore. The games are pretty bad and ruined any chance of the series being any good once more)\n\n\n\nI hope you've enjoyed my lengthy review. Crysis is easily one of my favorite games of all time, if not THE favorite (Next to New Vegas <3). I'm sure you'll enjoy the game, here are some mods I reccomend;\n\nBlackfire's Mod Ultimate OR CyberAlien's Extreme Immersive mod\nAdvanced AI\nRealistic Enhancement\nRygels HD Texture pack AND HD Crysis Texture Pack 2016\nMaximum Immersion\nCrysis 2 Nanosuit Voice (Crysis 2 did a lot of things wrong but the suit was awesome)\n\nEnjoy the game!","March 13","true","284.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/recommended/17300/","brendissimo","Brendissimo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/","277 products in account","Originally posted on January 21, 2010\n\nCrysis is an absolutely incredible experience that defines why PC gaming is great. It's an open world shooter with graphics that are 2.5 years old and are still by far the most impressive offering on the market. It's gameplay is a varied hybrid of stealth and action in the proud tradition of Far Cry one, and although there are a few problems with the game, it is one you should not miss if you own a PC.\n\nGameplay-As in it's spiritual successor, Far Cry, Crysis is a game that centers around island/tropics based combat in an open world with lots of vehicles and baddies with great AI that can use vehicles, flank, retreat, give orders, and call in unscripted backup. You hit multiple objectives using stealth or assault tactics and a wide variety of weapons.\n\nThis much has not changed very much from Far Cry, and I see no problem with that. The AI very much Far Cry 1.5 AI, which is impressive considering Far Cry AI still tops many games on the market. Enemy vehicles still chase you relentlessly once you are discovered, and harder levels can be particularly brutal. You are not usually accompanied by many friendlies in a helpful manner, but there are certain fixed engagements where you encounter friendly AI, and they get the job done decently. It remains a lone-wolf experience for the majority of the game.\n\nThe most major change comes in the form of the nano-suit, which allows speed, jumping/punching, and armor to rise to greater levels at the expense of energy, and the suit includes a cloaking device. This simple mechanic allows for a huge amount of fun to be had, especially in jungle infantry combat and in enemy camps.\n\nAnother change would be the addition of on the fly weapon customization, a brilliant addition, and the ability to pick up attachments as you progress through the game. I will say that as gamers we do not always stop to examine the model of each weapon lying on the ground or even in an armory and as a result miss out on early instances of great attachments, such as the sniper scope. Could the auto-ammo-pick-up system from warhead be included in the next installment with a feature that picks up attachments you don't have as well? That would be wonderful. Also, the ability to suppress certain weapons would be welcome and not altogether unbalanced or "unrealistic". I could envision the shotgun and sniper rifle being suppressed but with a louder sound signature and working in game just fine.\n\nI will say the alien gameplay is a little less fun, as it was with mutants in far cry, and though the story remains interesting, the enemies are somewhat less interesting to fight (warhead partially helps with this) due to less intelligent tactics and repetitive attacks. Also, the introduction of Aliens generally is accompanied by more linear missions, which is not where this type of game shines. Far Cry had the same problem.\n\nStory- However, far cry also had a terrible story, with about as much cheese as anyone can handle. Crysis' story actually is quite decent, and they really take advantage of some cool cinematic techniques to tell it. The plot certainly makes more sense than Avatar's, and the pacing is better too. And what Avatar's technical visuals are for movies, Crysis' are for games.\n\nVisuals- Crysis is currently(Jan. 2010) the best looking game on the market for any gaming platform, and will most likely continue to stay there until Crysis 2. This has been the situation since Crysis was released in 2007! This gap is of course due largely to the economic impact of console markets and in turn the technical limitations of consoles, and Crysis really demonstrates this gap. The last great PC exclusive graphics engine, in all honesty. Not to mention that after patching and drivers it is quite well optimized, and though I must admit I have a 4870, it runs well on much worse hardware. The Character models and lighting effects are standouts in the visuals category, accompanied by the water and foliage effects. The alien ship also looks astounding.\n\n\nAlso, the music is cinematic and the battle theme is really quite exceptional.\n\nAll in all, Crysis is a graphics juggernaut that nothing on the market can really touch, and incredible shooter and gaming experience, and not a half bad-cinematic experience either (certainly better than any big-budget Michael Bay style film I've ever seen). This comes together in one amazing package that meets all expectations as far as I'm concerned, even if it could have improved in a few areas.","December 31, 2013","true","41.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I heard the console versions never did the game justice either. This year I was playing it for the first time and even now it's a remarkably beautiful game. The southeast Asia setting is  vibrant and complex, and the countless explosions is endless entertainment. However, for the most part the game plays out much like any other military styled FPS you've seen before but with suit modifications at your disposal; Speed, Strength, Cloak are enhanced at the cost of your armor. Nothing crazy. The Sci-Fi twist in the story is what makes this stand out amongst the other carbon copy shooter's and having no interest in the multiplayer I don't see much replay value.

Your suit can dial up different abilities: Choose the "Shield" setting if you want to run into combat guns-a-blazin', choose the "Speed" option if you need to outrun pursuing opponents, or choose a cloaking option if you're pinned down and need to sneak away.\n\nMuch like the Spy's cloak in TF2, Crysis' cloak doesn't last long enough to engage in real stealth missions, this most noticable absence.\n\nA suit setting for "strength" that lets you, um, jump high (?) becomes a way to solve environmental puzzles, like how to scale a cliff. (Hint: look for the rock outcroppings that look like tall stairs. There's always one nearby.)\n\nI like this open-endedness. You are rewarded for finding a location to survey the road ahead and plan an attack. Disregard the voice in your ear telling you how important it is that you move along urgently.\n\nBut I generally did not enjoy the gameplay. Run a bit, fight a bit. Run a bit, fight a bit. It gets old quickly. And it's the kind of game that forces you to scour for ammo, and constantly re-choose between several types of rifles, based on what the enemies around you are using. Me? I prefer the Half-Life model where you just bring every gun along and collect ammo as you walk near to it. Requiring any more effort that that feels like unpleasant work, and it bogs this game down.\n\nThe story is disposable, and I never felt attached to the events of the game. The AI is good, and very aggressive.\n\nBut let's be honest. The appeal of Crysis in 2007 was the then-fantastic graphics. The game still looks good in 2012, but it's far from cutting edge, today. Take away the graphics and you're left with a so-so shooter. Proceed accordingly.\n\n","November 22, 2012","true","2.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I found myself not bothering with things like the stealth and speed mode very often as they both drain your energy incredibly quickly. On hard difficulty, a few well-placed enemy bullets can still take you down if you're not careful so you don't really feel invulnerable.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly standard FPS fare, akin to Call Of Duty or whatever, with open-ish world elements but lots of set pieces. The game world never feels as open as, say, the Far Cry series and you are pretty much railroaded into tackling things in order, though how you approach each set piece is up to you and you do feel that you can take a variety of approaches to solve the obstacles you encounter.\n\nThe graphics have really stood the test of time, It didn't feel particularly dated.\n\nMy only gripe was that the campaign only took me 10 hours to play through - and I didn't exactly rush through it. If I'm honest, the storyline is also very standard and unengaging, following a rather cliched 'US saves the world from alien invasion that is unwittingly aided by the nasty Asians' formula that's all too familiar by now.\n\nOverall, I'd say that if you're a fan of the FPS genre, you've never played Crysis before and you see if on sale for a few pounds/dollars (like I did) then it's definitely worth picking up! It's an enjoyable, if short, experience.","March 13, 2015","true","10.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","4"

The choice to quietly eliminate the enemy patrol or go in guns blazing. The only category where that game falls short is the storyline. It wasn't bad not by any means, but I just wish that it had been a little more story driven. Anyway, if you want a beautiful looking game with some great gameplay, I recomend Crysis.

At the time of it's release it was by far the most technologically challenging game to play, utilizing graphics that would make even the high end PC's of the time scream in terror. Because of this simple fact it was for the longest time mentioned in conversation much as one would mention a benchmark tool and throughout gaming, that is how it was viewed. A measure of the strength of your PC. A strange fate for a game.\n\nAlthough there has never been much concern for the game beneath the graphics Crysis isn't a bad game. Although it does nothing new or revolutionary it is a good solid FPS that is spared the horrors of knee high walls that often afflicts other games in this genre.\n\nYou play as a super soldier wearing the Crytek version of power armor, a skintight bodysuit that lets you active various temporary abilities such as invisibility and bullet absorption. Although the attempt at stealth is fairly half-hearted the ability to leap 20 feet into the air and jump 60 miles per hour allows you to engage enemies in a variety of ways and that certainly helps keep the gunplay fresh.\n\nThe storyline is fairly standard, supersoldier stuff and the voice-acting doesn't go completely bad despite some poorly casted movie stars as your supporting cast.\n\nAll in all it's a fun play although not a game I think would have ever been made much noise about if it wasn't for the incredible graphics.","November 18, 2012","true","112.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

It's the fabled representative of the "PC master race" cause. Is it a good game? Well, lets see.\n\nThe story is a bit cliched, reeking of "Humanity screwed around with something they shouldn't have" trope, but it is handled with a bit of creativity. You are Nomad, a member of Raptor team, an elite group of soldiers for the U.S Military. It's 2020, and you and you're team are dispatched to rescue some hostages from the Korean People's Army. The hostages were apparantly scientists and archaeologists who had found something buried in the biggest mountain in the area. So, you initally get seperated from your team, and one of your squadmates who barely has any character gets killed off screen by something who "Tore his body up bad". From there, you trek you're way across the island you're set on, killing wave after wave of KPA troops. You learn a fanatical general, General Kyong, is in charge of the Korean Military occupation of the island, and you find one of the hostages. Then you start to get a sense that something else is on this island with you. Something inhuman. Raptor team's leader, Prophet, gets kidnapped by the same thing that killed your other squadmate in the opening, and you eventually get to General Kyong in a rather anticlimatic boss fight, ending with learning that yes. Aliens are in fact real, and that they really love the cold. From there, it just devolves to "Stop the Aliens from taking over the world." I say the story is cliched, sure, but it has it's moments. The voice acting is top notch, with at least some of the actors caring for their roles. Sure, almost all of Raptor team seems to be full of racial and cultural stereotypes, but they grow on you after a while. Heck, Psycho, the british personality, got so popular he even got his own spin-off game, but i'll get to that another time. As for your character, Nomad, he's a little bland. He hardly says anything, as per the first person shooter method, but dare I say, even Master Chief from the Halo series has more character than him. He just seems like the standard, military type who's honorable, and tough. And thats about it. All in all, it's an okay sci-fi plot. Nothing too new brought to the table, but not terrible.\n\n\n\nThe gameplay is pretty damn solid. The biggest table-turner and innovation you have in the game, is the Nanosuit. Imagine if  Master Chief's suit got a major upgrade. Like, major. Actually, imagine this. Imagine if Master Chief's suit, got the abilities of Flash, The Predator, and Hulk. Thats the Nanosuit in a nutshell. It has four distinct modes to choose from. Strength, Speed, Cloak, and Armor. You can only use one at a time, but changing them up on the fly will help you win many, many battles. The Cloak is a little abusive, but thats what Delta level difficulty is for, where the enemy will often see your little invisibility trick. Armor mode is also another one thats pretty abusive, but it does make combat so much easier. Speaking of combat, the firefights in this game are pretty intense sometimes. You do have a somewhat limited arsenal. Theres no carrying around ten different kinds of guns like Duke Nukem 3D or Half Life, but it's no two weapon limit either. You get two primary weapons, two pistols, ten grenades, a heavy weapon like an RPG, C4 charges, and your bare hands. The primary weapon variety in this game is diverse, with 3 kinds of machine guns, and a few others I won't spoil here. Almost every weapon has customization options, like different kinds of scopes, or laser sights. Now, about your enemies. Don't think for a second, that just because the KPA are made entirely of a rather low tech militia, that they aren't dangerous. Each and every one of them can and will kill you without a thought. The A.I that drives them is also nice to watch. While they sometimes do goofy things, like stare at walls, and shout that they are throwing a grenade, but the grenade never comes, they sometimes do rather intelligent things, like flank you, take cover in the bushes, and converge on you from all different angles. The manner in which you take on the numerous amount of KPA infantry is also pretty expansive. Do you go in, all guns blazing, tearing and blowing everything up in sight? Or do you prefer to be the human equivalent of the Predator, sneaking in and taking them out one by one? The choice is yours. Theres also a fair amount of vehicular combat as well, but these vary in the fun factor. For example, the section where you blast your way through a valley in a tank is beyond the term awesome, but other sections like the VTOL retreat, just feel a bit broken, especially in control. Oh, and then theres the latter half of the game. With the aliens. Once you leave the mountain halfway through the game, say bye bye to diverse tactics and combat options, and say hello to generic "Just use a really BFG to kill them!". Seriously, the alien combat is the dullest and most boring thing I experienced with this game. There is no specific weakness to exploit with the aliens, just fill them full of projectiles until they crash and burn. To poorly balance this, the final boss of the game, has easily exploitable weaknesses, that make the fight over in less than ten minutes. Overall, I say that Crysis's gameplay is fun as all gets out, until the second you beat General Kyong, and then it all goes downhill from there. Thats just my opinion however. The multiplayer, on the other hand, well...I heard it was fun when people actually played it. The Power Struggle gametype seems like a creative idea, outright destroying the enemy team's base? Sounds pretty awesome to me.\n\n\nIn terms of graphics, yes, Crysis is pretty to look at. The world is very detailed, and realistic. However, I promise you, that you'll be spending about twenty minutes in the settings of the game, tweaking and testing, until you get it to look exactly how you want it to look. Once you do though, you'll wonder how this was a game made in 2007, with it's vibrant colors, detailed textures, realistic physics, and excellent sound design. Also, the soundtrack by Inon Zur is amazing, with flourishes coinciding with whats going on around you.\n\n\nOverall, for it's okay story, pretty fun gameplay, and it's nice-to-look-at graphics, I give Crysis a 6/10. It's a must have for any fan of the first-person-shooter genre, and I highly reccommend it.","March 11, 2014","true","1.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I am also running Windows 8 (which the system requirements say nothing about as far as compatibility issues are concerned).  And to make a long story short, I am currently unable to play Crysis.

I definitely wasn't worried about my GTX 670 and i5-3750k having trouble.\n\nI had psyched myself up about the visuals so much that my initial impression was "well this doesn't look half bad..." and then I remembered how old the game is. And I nearly peed myself. Even the cutscenes were rendered in the game engine, so the game always had a consistent visual style.\n\nThe appeal for anybody who plays Crysis is of course the beautiful graphics, so I wasn't expecting much from the story or gameplay. As it turns out the gameplay was really good; the controls were nice and tight, even when you drive vehicles. Even flying a VTOL (those flying things that work like helicopters) and floating around in zero-gravity was intuitive, which is saying a lot.\n\nAlthough Crysis is obviously a linear game, the map was usually open enough that as long as you are going in the general direction of your next objective (which is what your character, Nomad, would be doing anyway) you won't feel constrained at all.\n\nThe one area where gameplay suffered was the enemy AI. I found them laughably stupid, and took great sadistic pleasure in luring large numbers of them into small choke points where I could easily mow them down.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, there were a couple of areas where I really wasn't given sufficient tools to complete the objectives. One example was a map where I was trying to destroy a few anti-aircraft emplacements. I ended up having two enemy helicopters following me around, and I only found one rocket launcher on the entire map. It was a pretty open map so I may have missed the others, but they weren't in any of the obvious places. So I ended up just running around cloaked as much as possible until I managed to complete my objective. Oh, and once that was complete the helicopters magically went away.\n\nThe nano suit is the biggest aspect of the game (besides the graphics) that differentiates Crysis from other military shooters. The suit allows you to choose between several modes: strength, speed, armor, and cloak. Thanks to the nano suit you can play the game using a variety of play styles. One of my favorite things to do was to sneak into a complex cloaked dual-wielding a couple of silenced pistols with laser sights. It then became a nice little exercise in shooting everyone in the head one at a time before they figured out that I was there (and given that the AI was so stupid they would only figure out that I was there if they got a nice long look at me while uncloaked.) Ninja Nomad.\n\nThe story can be summed up pretty quickly: North Koreans and aliens on a tropical island.\n\nOnce you know that, nothing will surprise you. There were no plot twists, no sudden betrayals or finding out someone was a double agent or anything. But I was fine with that, because that wasn't why I was there anyway. That being said, I did like the ending; it was a satisfying "hell yeah!" at the end of a nice ten-hour campaign.\n\nIf you are at all interested in playing Crysis, now is the best time to do it. The game is old enough that it is really cheap but it is still new enough to look good.","February 14, 2013","true","10.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Whether that is super speed, stealth, super strength, or armor. This game has a bit more of an open world compared to Crysis 2. Unfortunately i haven't played 3 yet, but i will at some point to get more of the story. This game is worth what the price is for the single player. I would however wait for a sale with a bundle together for it. Get them all at once for cheap :P\n\nAnyways i would love to get more into this game and tell you about the story, but i think i'll just let the game speak for itself. Enjoy one of the most graphically astounding games of it's time and have fun in one of the most fun games i ever played. :)\n\n(fyi i played this on ps3 a bit more than the steam version)","November 19, 2014","true","5.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The game treats itself seriously and allows you to tackle challenges in anyway you want\n\nPros\n-Nanosuit changes on command to Stealth mode, Strength mode, Speed mode, and Defense Mode\n-Guns feel realistic powerful\n-Enemy AI is smart and will respond to your actions intelligently, which requires great awareness to overcome\n-Huge World\n-Graphics definetely hold up to this day, even for a game made almost a decade ago\n-Modability allows for even greater longevity\n-You feel like you are in control of every situation and are not limited to some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mechanic\n-You can hold MULTIPLE WEAPONS. Not just limited to TWO. A pistol, 2 primaries, and explosives.\n\nCons-\n-Game story feels kind of similar to the original Halo's story\n-(this may be a individual issue) but I have issues running this game in 64 bit, with a gtx 980 and an amd fx8350. Doesn't make sense.\n-Can be confusing at times\n\nOverall this game is great, and a must own for any PC gamer.","October 17, 2014","true","19.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

The gameplay, however, is still incredibly fun, and offers so many options that every encounter can be different. Your Nanosuit has four abilities, and the use of each one drains your suit's Energy bar. Fortunately it, as well as your health, regenerate in a decent pace to allow quick, exciting and varied combat sessions. Combined with cars and boats, as well as fairly open level designs, each fight in Crysis can be a fresh experience unlike many other shooters.\n\nYour armor has "Speed" to dart around the battlefield and rush up to enemies to knock them down. "Strength" for stronger melee, as well as high jumps (one of the favorite fights in my playthrough was using this to jump over a fence into an enemy base, and then run around their rooftops, hopping from one to the other and gunning them down as I go). "Armor" to absorb damage and hasten the recovery of Energy and Health. And lastly, "Invisibility". The stealth aspect of the game isn't as refined as it could be - silent takedowns aren't too silent and you can't hide bodies - but still enjoyable.\n\nWeapons are also modifiable to a small degree with different attachments, adding yet another layer of tactics and allowing different approaches.  Sadly, even on the toughest difficulty (which isn't as maddeningly frustrating as Modern Warfare was for me), I didn't feel a need to switch weapons out of necessity. Just for variation's sake. You can safely beat the game just with the standard rifle you'll find. But, again, experimenting is fun here.\n\nIt took me 12 hours to complete, but I expect to have another playthrough eventually. Both because it's honestly a very fun shooter, and because by the end of the game you really get the hang of using your suit, vehicles and weapons, that you'll feel like revisiting those early levels where you were still fumbling around. Seeing as this isn't a linear game, those early levels /are/ worth revisiting, because the experience will thankfully be different.\n\nP.S.\nIt's still a very pretty game, too!","July 8, 2014","true","12.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But in the two+ years since release it's become a lot easier to get the hardware necessary to play, and if you've got it you owe yourself the chance to see the visual glory Crysis offers.\n\nCrysis is more than a pretty picture though; the game offers some deft gun combat that's mixed in with many opportunities to be sneaky thanks to your special powers. The vehicles however are unsatisfying to drive and the energy meter for your powers feels anemic. Fortunately the weapons you have at your disposal offer a pleasing punch allowing you to make good progress in the single player without feeling much frustration.\n\nStorywise the game strives for believability, but it's all balderdash play acting that undermines the serious aura.

With it's revolutionary graphics, and a great singleplayer, Crysis is as good as it got when it came to sandbox shooters. The graphics still hold up 7 years later and even still look better than most modern games, which is quite unheard of in video games. The Nanosuit really gives the game a different take on shooters than all the other ones out there, in a really good way. As much greatness the Crysis series has brought with it though, it brought along plenty of disappointment as well with the series getting completely butchered with Crysis 2 and Crysis 3. When it comes to Crysis, Crysis 1 and Crysis Warhead are amazing games and some of the best shooters I've played and still worth playing if you missed out on it back in the day.","December 2, 2014","true","16.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/17300/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Crysis is something else: stunning graphics, an underused setting, an epic story, and an enjoyable multiplayer game to boot. People playing this will likely recall FarCry, with good reason. Crysis is the evolution of that title, using a new engine, but keeping the general feel of a 'hell in paradise'.\n\nIt all begins with what looks to be like a simple rescue mission. You and your group, equipped with the latest in nano-augmented suit technology, parachute into North-Korean-occupied territory to find an archaeologist. It should be a simple rescue mission, but something is definitely wrong, and as you continue through the island you've been dropped into, you'll find that there are more players in this game than you think.\n\nThe action in the single-player experience is as intensive as you want to make it. Your nano-suit grants you a variety of abilities, each of which augment what you can do and, depending on your use, how you play. You can increase your strength, adding damage to your attacks and allowing you to jump a dozen feet in the air; you can increase your speed, allowing you to run blindingly around your opponents; you can increase your armor, allowing your suit energy to take damage until it runs out and you start to bleed; or you can enter cloak mode, arguably one of the most useful suit abilities, which makes you invisible for a short time, allowing you to sneak around your opponents and confront them on your own terms.\n\nRunning into the fray, guns blazing, is always an option but a difficult one. It doesn't take a lot to bring you down, and when you have at least half a dozen enemies gunning for you, things can get real deadly real quick. Hiding in the underbrush allows you to stay out of sight of enemies, which is crucial when lookout towers are scattered across the territory that you need to move through. The result is gameplay that tends to be tense at times, but at others sometimes just feels like the bushes are playing a game of hot-potato, and you're the potato.\n\nThe game offers some magnificent environments, a notable difference from the usual faire in its genre. Maps span kilometres, which is an impressive feat that allows the game to be played differently than just running through small corridors. Though visually stellar, the problem with the environments is that many of them consist only of a valley that makes you move in a straight line to get to your target, as opposed to the wide-open nature of others. These valleys are probably more open than most FPS games, but they're a stark contrast to other sections of the game, and feel all the more constrained because of it.\n\nThe presentation is pretty top-notch: great acting, great story, and a pace that keeps the action going throughout.The single player campaign may be fun, but it does end, and when it does, the multiplayer game is where you go to continue the action. Luckily, it delivers quite excellently.\n\nCrysis has definitely raised the stakes when it comes to graphics, and is probably going to be used as a technical benchmark for many years to come. Its stunning environments and interesting gameplay that changes with the suit's powers create a very enjoyable experience.","March 11, 2014","true","7.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I loved it. I actually build my first rig back then. Myself, no prebuild crap. 8600GT and a Intel Pentium 4. Back then I wasnt spending much money for hardware. With that specs I was able to play the game on medium settings with playable FPS but that was it pretty much. In 1024x768. Gosh, couldnt even imagine myself playing like this anymore. Back then no hardware could run it playable with 30FPS on Very High. I guess my rig had like 10FPS, haha.\nAlso I was still using Windows XP so no DX10 for me back then, or 64Bit...\nMany years there was the term, "But can it run Crysis". Even today Crysis still serves as Benchmark.\nBut thats snow from yesterday as we Germans say, so lets get into the review.\n\nThe story is about some US soldiers invading a island named Ling Shan. Their mission is to safe some people and uncover the secrets of the island. You are Nomad and belong to those soldiers. The island belongs to the Korean army and General Kyong is the leader of them. The US soldiers dont stay undercover for long and have to deal with the army and... something else. Something else is present on this island and while you do your journey through the island you are going to uncover this entity.\n\nThe game is a FPS. You have to pass through very big open world levels to reach your mission goals and progress in this game. While you are doing so, many soldiers and other things will attack you. Luckily you have a bunch of weapons AND the Nanosuit! The Nanosuit pretty much is the reason why this game sets itself apart from other generic FPS shooters. Its a armor with that you can be very strong, fast, armored and even invisible. For a certain time until the energy has to recover. I love this feature about the game. Its so simple, yet addicting. On your way you also often get the possibility of using vehicles. How you do certain goals is up to you. Go in guns blazing or stealth. On higher difficulties you should definitely try to stealth. The difficulty can be quite high at points. Especially when playing on something higher than normal.\n\nThe game is made by Crytek. One of my favorite developers of our time.\nThe game runs on the CryEngine 2 which, similar to Far Cry in 2004, made a revolution in terms of graphics in videogames. Nothing could even mess with the CryEngine 2 back then. Not even the Unreal Engine 3 which came out around the same time and often was praised for its graphics. It even offered DX10 and 64Bit support. But the downside of this was that the engine was extremely taxing on PCs. Even top notch highend rigs couldnt handle the game on very high settings. I really loved the graphics, it was amazing to see what actually was possible. It really looked like RL.\nEven today the game still looks stunning and beautiful, even if the CryEngine 3 probably took its place as best looking engine. This was especially noticeable after Crysis 3 came out. Crysis 2 sadly didnt use its full potencial at launch. But this was addressed with patches and even Crysis 2 looked stunning after the patches. Still, Crysis is unmatched for me in terms of gameplay and graphics. Also Crysis was not made for consoles, unlike its other games. Therefore I guess Crysis was not limited to anything like level sizes. But its probably also the memories that I have with this game. Crysis 2 and 3 are also amazing games and I like to replay all of them from time to time, or after I have a new rig. Always when I have a new rig or something about my hardware changed, its time to play Crysis. Its something like a ritual for me, haha.\n\nPostive:\n- MAXIMUM GRAPHICS\n- Somewhat good KI\n- Good difficulty\n- Interesting story which is told and explained in all 3 games\n- Nice weapon amount and feeling\n- High quality Crytek game\n- CHICKEN\n- Weapons are modable like attaching flashlight, laser, silencer, scopes\n- Game includes well performing cars\n- Nanosuit sets the game apart from other FPS\n- Amazing big open world levels\n- Great Soundtrack\n- 100% Pure PC game\n- Has a addon called Crysis Warhead\n- Even today still serves as Benchmark\n- Multiplayer still active with community patch\n- Many mods available\n- MEMORIES\n\nNegative:\n- Partly unoptimized for modern hardware, especially AMD, doesnt even run out of box on several rigs\n- Steam version missing 64Bit files, check my guide to obtain them\n- Some stupid small bugs like dying from collision...\n\nReplayability: Very High\n\nMy Rating: 9.5/10\nThis game is simply one of my favorites of all time. This probably has also to do with the memories I have with this game. I always have this moment in mind where I was walking through the bushes and reaching an overlook. The sun was just rising and I could see big part of the island with palm trees moving in the wind, sun breaking its light through the leaves and an amazing soundtrack fading in. Woah... One of the best moments in gaming ever.\nI also find it extremely well replayable. The gameplay is just extreme fun. The story is also well made.\nDefinitely a game to pick up!","March 20","true","16.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Firstly, and most famously, it looks absolutely stunning. On maximum settings the island on which the adventure takes place truly comes to life. The quality of the graphics and the physics remain unsurpassed, in my opinion, even when compared to more recent games. Immersion is critical in games such as this and the CryENGINE used provides this in spades. There’s also a pretty good storyline behind the action and the pacing is good, with the action steadily ramping up to an impressive big finale. The voice acting is always convincing and the cut-scenes fit seamlessly into the flow of the game. The combat is challenging and rewarding. I have just two criticisms: First is the fact that the single player game ends! I wanted much more but this is a game that can be played more than once as the “sandbox” nature of the island allows for different approaches to the gameplay, plus there’s a good multiplayer version to continue the fun, and there are custom maps and mods out there. Second, there’s not enough humour. I think any game benefits from a few laughs (the Half-Life series is an excellent example) but I can’t remember any in CRYSIS. Still, this doesn’t matter too much when what you’re given is so absorbing and entertaining.\n\n5/5","December 1, 2013","true","36.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That said, it was ahead of its time, and I beleive has had an impact on the industry and customer satisfaction even across genres due to the hardware driven nature of this title.\n\nEven if you do not delve into the hardware and system tweaking discussions that can be evoked by even mentioning the name Crysis at all, you are left with a great game conceptually and artistically.\n\nThe story-telling and voice/character acting are very seamless, and all the entire architecture of the game design is cohesive.  I was pleasently surprised to see the game evolve from remote island views to frozen SCI-FI worlds that are revealed in a manner that is very enthralling.  The plot and enemy design are the best things about this game to me, and they are why I think it is hard to put this game down even years after its debut (although the graphics are what made me interested in the game to begin with).\n\nUnfortunately, it has taken all those years since its release for me to fully appreciate and realize this, as I could not get to the interesting parts without system lags interfering with the enjoyable quality of the game.  I found the game hard to enjoy at 15FPS, and I think anyone who has played this game on maximum settings without frame drops would not trade the experience.\n\nWhen Crysis came out, you would be lucky to get 30FPS on maxed out settings on a medium-high end PC.  This probably is no longer the case and you can enjoy what was at the time about the closest thing to being in control of an interactive movie on your system.\n\nThis game continues to push hardware limits, and today is probably much more accessible to the average gamer than it was when it was first released and barely playable without spending a mere fortune.  The graphics are just as stunning as the physics, and the CRY-engine is polished but can be laggy at times compared to more light-weight games (depending on your system specifications).  The most optimized platforms at max settings continue to respect real-world dynamics and rigid body interactions/physics in a more satisfying manner than most competitive games/engines do with respect to fluid/solid body motions and raycasting/tracing in my opinion.\n\nI did find the environments and modeling of terrain to be more photorealistic in Crysis 1 as compared to its sequel; however, my system still has trouble handling the DX-11 patches for Crysis-2 on max settings on HD6990 Radeon and IntelX990.  This game is fun just because it is hard to talk about it without discussing the hardware and graphics, but I do think the animation style, branding and abundance of environmental details are what carried this game into public visibility and have secured it a place in videogame history.  At the end of the day, it is a beautiful game with extreme longevity with regards to its visual presentation.","May 9, 2014","true","29.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The most notable detail, one that you'll see as soon as you begin playing, is the scenery. The aesthetically pleasing environment of this FPS puts all others to shame.

Ancient technology of an alien civilization buried in the earth.\n\nAnd now I'm sitting in the same pose as that History Channel bloke, ALIENS.\n\nOutside of combatting an awakening alien scourge, you fight against a division of the Korean Military who have occupied the island due to the discovery, using stealth, wits, various vehicles, and your Nanosuit to overcome the challenges facing you.\n\nThe game also features a realtime weapon modification mechanic, allowing you to swap out attachments and ammo types on the fly, you unlock these attachments as you find them ingame, my personal recommendation is to use an assault scope and a silencer on your FY-71, and then keep a Precision Rifle with a Sniper scope handy for those crucial shots.\n\nI will not spoil any of the game's major plot points, play it for yourself if you are interested.","March 28, 2013","true","25.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not someone to buy a game just because the graphics look nice but this is a must own for anyone that can appreciate detail and great level design. The giant island sandbox, mixed with highly destructible environments makes this game shine. There's nothing like getting on a heavy machine gun turrent, mowing down everyone in front of you while trees are being cut down, dirt chunks are flying into the air and small shacks are getting destroyed crumbling into pieces. Or throwing a grenade into a small village full of enemies and watching sheet metal fly, walls being blown apart while enemies fly into them.\n\nThe games only downfall is it starts out very slow, but just stick with it, the more you progress the more the game throws at you and you'll be in some great fire fights.\n\nIf you have this game (and played it very little) or want to buy it do yourself a favor and download Tactical Expansion Mod V1.1.

The fact that that's just one way of many to go about your objectives is one of the reasons it's a great game.\n\nCrysis' strengths are numerous. Gun-play feels satisfying, both the actual shooting of enemies as well as the feedback of toying around with attachments, to the extent that if you played the game as a straight shooter, you probably wouldn't be disappointed. That the movement options available to you wide and varied, from the slow and stealthy approach to the super fast leaping-and-bounding traversal. That you can approach an encounter in a myriad of ways, some because it will be more effective and some because it'll just be plain fun. That these are all wrapped up in a gorgeous visual presentation and audio that gives weight to your movement and minute-to-minute actions is just an icing on an already yummy cake.\n\nReally though it's the freedom of the game to let you do things the way you want to that is its strongest aspect, clearly in exchange for a hum-drum plot that, whilst a little awkward, changes tone and direction in the second half to something that is at least a little more engaging. That each objective is punctuated by an open enviroment with traversal allowing you to explore the islands you operate on with no real time limit gives the game a much bigger scope than simply moving from one fire-fight to the next, preventing any sense of boredom creeping in, but ultimately it's down to you to keep things as entertaining as you want them to be. So yes, again, you could just shoot your way through everything, but perhaps you'll strap some explosives to a truck, drive up to a base stealthed, dive out of the car at the last moment and watching the vehicle explode and the base erupt into chaos as you sleuth around it to eliminate any opposition. Or maybe you'll just zoom around at maximum speed punching your targets and sending them flying into walls. It's your choice.\n\nWhilst the freedom in play is reduced in the second half of the game with the plot's directional change, the feeling of the hunter is swapped around and instead of using your suit's powers for offensive actions, you're using them to survive in any manner you seem most suitable. With a pace that's consistent and overall length that is neither too short nor overstays its welcome as well as proving as much replayability as you have creativity, Crysis is a great first person shooter with a high quota for enjoyment.","February 11, 2014","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Boy was I wrong and I am GLAD for it. I was expecting to step into the shoes of a Master Chief style tank/super soldier that could Clint Eastwood his way through the fight. Crysis instead puts you into the shoes of an American Special Forces soldier and asks you to think like one. It was VERY refreshing and VERY welcome. The Nano Suit (think super soldier suit) which you wear doesn't make you an invincible force of nature but instead makes you feel like you are wearing a USEFUL military designed peice of hardware. It expands the natural abilities that a special forces soldier would need and use, not grant him super powers. The suit merely gives you options to tackle any situation how you see fit and THAT is what makes this game clever.\n\nI also want to put on record that I know and understand that the Crysis series is designed to break computers. I played this game on Maximum settings as intended and it is FREAKING GORGEOUS. A game that came out in 2007 still beats out most modern day titles that I have seen in 2014. It is wonderful to be awed by the graphics of a game to this extent and I am blessed to own a computer that could handle it easily (although I do feel that this would be a sticking point for many players with underpowered hardware). Just because my experience was great, doesn't mean your experience will be. Please understand that your milage could vary from my review!\n\nSo I finished the game in 12 hours (which is leaning on the shorter side)  but the story and the pacing complimented this length nicely so it is hard to chalk this as adrawback. I also played with a gamepad (Xbox 360) but it is easy to tell that Crysis is designed with the Keyboard and Mouse in mind. It works don't get me wrong!

Firstly, and most famously, it looks absolutely stunning. On maximum settings the island on which the adventure takes place truly comes to life. The quality of the graphics and the physics remain unsurpassed, in my opinion, even when compared to more recent games. Immersion is critical in games such as this and the CryENGINE used provides this in spades. There’s also a pretty good storyline behind the action and the pacing is good, with the action steadily ramping up to an impressive big finale. The voice acting is always convincing and the cut-scenes fit seamlessly into the flow of the game. The combat is challenging and rewarding. I have just two criticisms: First is the fact that the single player game ends! I wanted much more but this is a game that can be played more than once as the “sandbox” nature of the island allows for different approaches to the gameplay, plus there’s a good multiplayer version to continue the fun, and there are custom maps and mods out there. Second, there’s not enough humour. I think any game benefits from a few laughs (the Half-Life series is an excellent example) but I can’t remember any in CRYSIS. Still, this doesn’t matter too much when what you’re given is so absorbing and entertaining.\n\n5/5","December 1, 2013","true","36.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a georgeous masterpiece that looks amazing and stands the test of time. When this game came out in 2007 I can assure you that almost nobody had a powerful enough machine to run this game maxed out. As much as I could say about the graphics it is more than just a tech demo and is an amazing game in just about every other aspect. The game takes place in the year 2020 were you play as a nano-suited supersoldier named Nomad. This suit has many features such as cloak mode, armour mode, strength made, and speed mode. It can also help the user survive in extreme cold and heat. You are sent to the Korean controlled Lingshan Islands when you recieve a distress signal from a scientist named Rosenthal. As you continue your mission members of your team start to die in weird ways and things get stranger and stranger. Little does the team know that their suits have awakened an alien race hidden in the island. I won't spoil the ending because this is a game that you should play for yourself. The gameplay of Crysis is quite fun. This FPS puts you on the island and it is huge and allows you to choose your own path to the next objective. Do you sneak in through the woods and make it undetected or storm in in an armored car. The choice is yours. As for the weapons there are several modern and futeristic weapons ranging from sub-machine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, pistols, shotguns, rocket launchers, modified alien mini turrets, and even your own fists. As for multiplayer there are two main modes. There is a standard deathmatch mode and then there is the power struggle mode. In power struggle there are two teams, each with their own main base. The point of the game is to capture smaller command points and to kill members of the other team until you have enough money to get a really powerful weapon to take out the enemy's main base and win the game. going back to graphics there are some more things to talk about. The game came out right around when windows vista came out and supposedly can take advantage of its features. Mainly it can run in DX10 mode although it was mainly built around DX9. You normally can't acces very high settings on DX9 so windows xp users would be out of luck but there are two ways around this. The first is to go into the configuraton file and edit it to force very high settings on DX9 wich looks almost exactly the same as on DX10 with the only difference being some subtle lighting effects only on DX10. The other way is to get a version of DX10 that will run on windows xp that was released a year or two ago, go to the files for Crysis and change the name of the file called D3D9 to D3D10 and then change D3D10 to D3D9, and then to go into the lauch options on Steam and type in this line " -DX10". This will allow you to run Crysis on the highest settings in DX10 mode on windows xp. This game is more than worth the 20 dollars it costs to get. I hope this review was helpful and that you enjoy this masterpiece as much as I have.","January 2, 2014","true","37.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/haxmonster/recommended/17300/","haxmonster","Haxmonster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/haxmonster/","133 products in account","In 2007 Turkish-German game developer Crytek released ‘Crysis’, a cryengine-built first person shooter which exceeded the graphical norm at the time more than any other game ever did or would later do. Almost no computer could run it at the time and for many years it would be the ideal game to test new gaming PC’s with, but even disregarding this main strength of the game Crysis is a very decent FPS.\nIn Crysis you take the role of an American soldier named ‘Nomad’ who is part of an elite squadron of nanosuit-equipped soldiers . You are sent to the Lingshan islands in the pacific to rescue a team of archeologists from North-Korean soldiers who took the place over. Story is not quite the part of the game that deserves closest examination because of that it is quite generic. After all, even back in 2007 there were already quite a few games that had the player kill soldiers while playing as an American soldier himself, but luckily the story takes a bit of a back seat here. It would not be until Crysis 2 that other things than combat would be given some attention. In terms of story delivery there is also nothing new here.\nWhat you would want to play Crysis for, if not the superb graphics, would be its gameplay and it does this quite well. Although it uses pretty standard FPS mechanisms the nanosuit makes for a welcome addition. Basically the suit gives you a choice of four superpowers, which consume from one general energy bar. There is a speed mode, pretty self-explanatory, a cloak mode that makes you largely invisible, a power mode that lets you jump higher and fling heavy objects and an armour mode. Using whatever improvements your power gives you costs energy and generally this system holds up pretty well. It is nice that you are given the choice between stealthing a section with the cloak or fighting through it normally, and if you choose the latter you can also pick different tactics with either the speed or the armour mode.  A nice small addition on the side is that you are at any time able to modify your weapon, which means you can pick your sight, add a suppressor or make other small modifications.\nThe game also excels in giving the player freedom. Before Crytek set about on making Crysis they made the original Far Cry. Why these developers are so attached to the word ‘cry’ remains a mystery. But anyway, Far Cry was an open world game which was, like Crysis, set on a tropical island and sometimes it seems as if the developers carved a big and wide linear path out of Far Cry’s sandbox to make Crysis because Crysis feels about as unlinear as a linear game can be. The entire game has a structure similar to Half Life 2, in that you are never teleported to a different location but always go there yourself. There are almost no missions that all of a sudden take place somewhere else unless the last mission had you go there by yourself. Some objectives give you entire towns to play around in, a lot of the houses can be smashed up and most objects can be grabbed and thrown as weapons. What also makes this game feel like some fenced-off sandbox is the completely free use of vechiles. When you need to go to the next firefight you can walk there if you want, or you can get in a car which the game just puts outside most villages. Driving mechanics are not very good though, so if you are being shot at you are in more danger in a car than on foot.\nAlthough Crysis is indeed a very good FPS it does have a few minor issues I want to mention. Firstly that would be the story. I understand that a game like this leaves little room for something outrageously good, but they could perhaps have done a little less effort to make the North-Koreans look like jerks because in a game based around so much military excessive force, as showcased in a level where you take part in a big tank offensive, making the enemy seem evil just puts the entire game in a big cliché. Of course in a game with such a simple story you want to have your side as the goodies and the other side to be the baddies, but emphasizing that so much makes it all feel a bit fake. Some enemies come across as silly cartoon villains. My other nibbles mostly restrict to specific sections and mentioning them spoils parts of the game for you, so be warned about the following part. What peeved me a bit about one level that takes place in an alien space ship was that the entire place is extremely disorienting. Although that bit still looks extremely gorgeous graphics-wise, I found myself moving through the same looped corridor about five times before I found the right way by accident and the beauty loses something if it is forced upon you for so long. Another annoying part was one section where your squadmate, ‘Prophet’, has a damaged nanosuit which means you have to escort him and bring him to some kind of heat source every few seconds to prevent him from dying. It is not even hard at all and the combat is not harder with him around, so the entire thing just feels like a silly delay.  On the side, I found the game’s soundtrack to be very unimaginative. It does nothing to increase the atmosphere.\nSo, in conclusion I would certainly recommend Crysis, even today. Although the graphics don’t excel anymore and the story is pretty rubbish, the gameplay is still very nice and you have plenty of liberty to explore the nanosuits potential, and that certainly outweighs the game’s few issues.\n","May 14, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, I've never been particularly a good graphics kind of gamer, I'm more about the gameplay in games. Luckily, the gameplay in Crysis is a lot of fun. The thing that really makes it is the nanosuit, giving you four different abilities to use: speed, strength, armour, and invisibility. Mixing and matching these four modes is a lot of fun, and allows for a lot of experimentation during combat. Stealth is also a crucial strategy, especially when there are dozens of enemies you have to eliminate. The enemy AI is very good as well, it works very well with stealth and during combat they will try to flank you. Add in the different weapon customizations, there are a lot of combinations to use in enemy encounters that it will keep you entertained for the duration of the campaign. The level design is also nice and open, giving you even more options like sniping and using vehicles.\n\nThe story in the game isn't particularly good, but this isn't the kind of game you play for the story, you should play it for the gameplay and graphics. However, where the game really faulters, is in the last two or two-and-a-half hours of the campaign when you start battling the aliens. The aliens just aren't as fun to fight as the Koreans and don't allow for much variation in the ways you want to fight them.\n\nCrysis is a great game, particularly is you like experimentation in the ways you want to handle the enemy encounters.  Half the fun is just seeing what kind of stuff you can get away with, and I love that.","October 10, 2012","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Firstly, and most famously, it looks absolutely stunning. On maximum settings the island on which the adventure takes place truly comes to life. The quality of the graphics and the physics remain unsurpassed, in my opinion, even when compared to more recent games. Immersion is critical in games such as this and the CryENGINE used provides this in spades. There’s also a pretty good storyline behind the action and the pacing is good, with the action steadily ramping up to an impressive big finale. The voice acting is always convincing and the cut-scenes fit seamlessly into the flow of the game. The combat is challenging and rewarding. I have just two criticisms: First is the fact that the single player game ends! I wanted much more but this is a game that can be played more than once as the “sandbox” nature of the island allows for different approaches to the gameplay, plus there’s a good multiplayer version to continue the fun, and there are custom maps and mods out there. Second, there’s not enough humour. I think any game benefits from a few laughs (the Half-Life series is an excellent example) but I can’t remember any in CRYSIS. Still, this doesn’t matter too much when what you’re given is so absorbing and entertaining.\n\n5/5","December 1, 2013","true","36.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'd like to say I can't quite place it, but I can indeed, and it saddens me: Choices. Not choices in the sense of determining who lives and dies, for those are typically semilinear in nature. Choices as in how to get from A to B, as the game places you in a large sandbox environment where the objective is to traverse from one end to the other. And while it very slowly begins to show some age, Crysis remains a beautiful and oddly invigorating game compared to many other FPS games I've played as of late.","February 11","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

In my mind the game stretched on into inifinity - and what an infinity it was.\n\nThe game goes through three distinct phases, each more jaw-droppingly perfect than the last. At first, one is navigating a jungly-coated tropical island world, evading - or annihilating, though this was never as fun for me - conventional, dastardly Korean forces in a manner strongly remeniscent of the original Far Cry (for me at least, Far Cry didn't really have any stealth component, though i did everything i could to force it to play like a stealth shooter nonetheless) In the second phase, all-out conflict has broken out and, while you can continue to play as a phantom if you wish, the stakes and scale soar upwards into 'epic' territory. In the third phase, you discover a vast and fantastic secret lurking within the island, exploring this secret in a state of permawonder, before re-emerging into a drastically altered form of the second phase, to see out the game.\n\nMy initial experience was cut short most of the way through the third phase, so in my mind it was, as I've said, neverending, and by jebus that neverending game was FPS fantasy made reality. It really is just an awesome game.\n\nQuite apart form the graphics, which are to this day superior to almost any other offering of comprable setting (visually if not technolgically, though the tech is still close), the gameplay is tight and perfectly polished. This is the kind of game that, while vaguely linear, allows a player to turn 100m of linear progression into around 1km of side-track meandering and sneaking more or less throughout the entire experience. One can craft one's own adventure here, as surely as any of those gimmicky kids books from the '90s, and just as everyone had envisioned in their wildest dreams back then this adventure is lush, endless and full of wonders more wonderous than the last.\n\nThe gameplay is consistent and with the possible exception of the final moments of the second phase, in which combat is more or less forced on you and the game literally ejects any background action in an effort - only marginally succesful - to turn your final stage into some kind of arena, it is consistently entertaining.\n\nWhy should you buy this game? Because your computer may very well finally be able to run it in something approaching max settings, because it is one of the best FPS experiences you will ever play, and because it is streets, miles ahead of any other similar game released in the years before or the years after.","April 22","true","17.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Definitely a game that stands out from the crowd.\nThe graphics were godlike when it came out, but by today's standards they're just "pretty good." The visual wow-factor is gone, but the gameplay is still entirely enjoyable. Storyline is pretty cool, too, but it unfolds in a fairly linear manner, and that's a bit of a turnoff for me.\nOverall, totally worth buying and playing. But certainly not deserving of the "OMG YOU HAVEN'T LIVED UNTIL YOU PLAY THIS GAME" kind of praise.\n///////////////////////\nBLACK3Y3 rating: 7.5/10","June 21, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Right now I feel like Crysis graphics are in a sweet spot since they are, ahead of their time as they were 8 years ago still great but, finally achievable on midrange computers like mione. FYI I played on a an overclocked intel pentium g3258 and an r9 280 and fas more than pleased with the results. The gunplay and gameplay generally are definitely top notch. One of the strongest points of the game is, the way it appears to me, that it offers a surprisingly high amount of replayability with different approaches, such as relying more on stealth, sniping or throwing. This wide range of possibilities in game coupled with a lot of destroyability makes up for an shooter that even after some years is unsurpassed in certain regards. The story may at times appear incohesive  but is most definitely one of epic scale.\n\nDespite all that i was for a moment on the verge of not recommending Crysis for pretty much just one reason. Bugs and glitches. During the last mission it occured to me not once not twice but over 20 times that I glitched through the floor to either die or get stuck. Afterwards I also crashed various times which allegedly madddened me a good bit more than I care to admit here. Those are however experiences that may have been individual to me. It may be, that you get to play this title without anything of that kind happening to you even once, leaving you with a 10/10 title.","June 14, 2015","true","9.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I played the entirety of the game using stealth and slow methodical tactics, whereas others played guns blazing, as a cover shooter. It is a sandbox in more ways than one.\n\nIn addition to that, the story is interesting and there are a few cinematic moments that get your adrenaline pumping\n\nNeedless to say that the game still looks amazing even after 6-7 years.","July 18, 2015","true","15.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I can't add much about Crysis from what you already know. The first game has the whole thing in terms of progression and environments. This port is decent (I can't say is the best) because  it has some issues to solve like the stuttering even if you have a monster machine and resolution compatibility but is as good as you remember. The bad thing is that maybe you'll find this at a not so cheap price and nowadays Crysis 3 is not on Steam to have the whole trilogy. Another bad thing is that the local multiplayer does not work as did in the past. I remember shoot rocket launchers from one side of the island to the other with a friend, we were testing our new Dell Inspiron Laptops with GeForce 8600m at that time hahaha. Another good memory was that this game managed the FOV in a way that we tried multiple displays up to 3 and it was a blast back then haha.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cerberusleader/recommended/17300/","cerberusleader","The Illusive Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cerberusleader/","261 products in account","8/10 deserves a play. I would recommend buying the Crysis Trilogy pack on origin. I do not like origin, but EA leaves no choice in this aspect. Crysis 3 is only available digitally on origin.\n\nI bought the game initially outside steam. When it came out, it took the world by storm with never before seen texture quality and overall graphics. "Can it play Crysis?" became the most asked question with regards to latest PC hardware. Then after a few months, maybe years, the hardware did catch up.  Although at first you had to spend all your saving to buy that 8800GTX and a core 2 quad to play the game at high resolution and settings, Now you can get a mid range graphics card and a processor to run it smoothly.\n\nWarning, MIGHT contain spoilers. You have been warned.\nIn terms of the game itself, the story is nothing ground breaking. Typical sci-fi scenario, aliens came to conquer the planet. You are the only one to stop them. Here though, you are given a toy which nobody else has: A Nano suit. The mother of all Hi-Tech exoskeleton stuff. The suit is pretty self explanatory and straight forward. It provides you basic armour and health regeneration along with slight boosts. You have the option to cloak, become a hulk, or run like roadrunner. It will all be apparent once you play the game. You can use these options in a variety of ways to achieve your goal. This along with the fact that the game is a sandbox, open world type game means that you can go about and experiment things. This alone is enough to justify this game. The story is not really that absorbing, but the environment makes up for it to an extent. Weapon customisation is good too. You can add, remove many things like different zoom scopes, or silences etc. There is nothing more to really say about the game.\n\nAll in all, I would not really say put it at the top of your list game, but it deserves a shot just to experience the sheer quality of graphics and open world style game play. As I pointed out before, probably better off buying The Trilogy pack on Origin, way cheaper that way, with the only factor being Origin. But it could be something that we can overlook just for the good series this is.\n\nAlso note that Crysis warhead maybe considered an expansion to the original Crysis. It doesn't count as a game in itself but is a part of the Trilogy.\n\nAnother note, I did also play Crysis 2 and Crysis 3, and those games are better set than the original Crysis. But again, it deserves a shot so go for it. It will also help to understand the overall plot of the game.","May 26, 2015","true","2.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","3"

I know its old, and for its time the graphics were amazing, but I just cant get over some pifalls of the gameplay. I know reviewing a game past its prime, you have to take things in consideration, but somethings I cant get over.\n\nFirst thing you want to do is bind the suit powers to a certain key. You cant do this. Why?  Honestly, thats why this game gets a bad review. Im sure there might be a mod that I could download but im not wasting my time. Using the toggle suit powers doesnt work, and having to use the wheel toggle to flip back and forth is slow, I feel defeats the purpose of the suit.\nYou cant melee guys that dont see you for an instant kill.  Some cue appears to grab enemy but I could never get it to work properly. I have this badass suit but no knife? Really?\nThe AI is horrible. I play games on hard and ultra hard, and I hate games where you are forced to use glitches to kill guys on ultra hard. Half the time they dont see you when they clearly should, and other times they see you immediately when they shouldnt.  And that sucks because the game relys heavily on stealth.  I dont quite see the purpose of the silencer.  If you kill a guy with a silencer everyone hears it. Using the Speed Power boost doesnt frighten or stagger the enemies at all, which I find really dumb. If I zip past 2 guys you would think their would be some delay before they would just turn around and kill me. Nope.\nPick up another pistol, and youll duel weild automatically and lose the iron sights on the pistol.  I never figured out how to single wield, and you cant aim with pistol anymore.  Dont pick up another pistol, and youll have no pistol ammo.\n\nWhats the biggest dissappointment is that you would think with the suit powers there would be some sort of combos or different play styles. There isnt. Strength is for jumping and breaking walls, speed is for getting around the map, armor is used for combat, stealth is what your forced to be in most of the time.\n\nI just found it kind of lame because of these problems.  The story seems really good though.\n","July 5, 2014","false","1.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Despite its release in 2007 the game has aoutstanding graphics that are hard to max out. You are thrown in this jungle where you must survive attacks from weird creatures and investigate their relationship with the north koreans. Overall I have found nothing wrong with theis game it is simply a very fun game.","March 18, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

From the company that had intrigued me for the longest time with their super realistic physics and graphics engine. I didn’t expect much from this game since the trailers made it look pretty much just like a tech demo. Surprisingly, though, it turned out to be a blast! Or at least half of it. There’s this supernatural atmosphere breathing down the neck of the player throughout the first act and it finally resolves itself as an alien invasion plot. Sadly, killing those aliens is just boring as hell. I would still classify this game as “good” because the first half of it is just so much fun. I must’ve spent hours just sneaking around the enemy bases and then tactically taking out the enemy soldiers from the shadows and that’s what made me wanna go on further and further. The graphics and physics are amazing and some of the driving and flying sections are a fun change of pace. It’s just that if we got a game that was like the first act of this game all the way through, it would easily deserve a couple of ranks higher score in my opinion.","November 25, 2013","true","8.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

While the player faces Korean soldiers and research facilities , an alien ship prepares to emerge and begin the invasion of Earth . Nomad faces Korean forces and tries to defeat the alien threat . The game submerges us under incredibly detailed rainforests. The physics of the game is excellent . Apart from the story, one enjoys walking around the environment , breaking the palms, catching animals, piloting boats , swimming with fish , and driving around the islands.\n\nThe graphics engine is the successor to Far Cry . It was a real revolution in real-time graphics . The image quality and texture is still among the best of all time . This makes the game very immersive . It took five years after release to play the game with very high quality settings and get a reasonable experience. Many people spoke at the time of bad optimization when in fact the game has three times more polygons than his contemporaries , volumetric clouds , day- night phases and huge maps. Nothing compared to the fixed pixelated sky on a Call of Duty game .\n\nThe player has a special suit that gives different powers or abilities for a period of time, such as invisibility , speed or armor. While it is not a Sandbox, it has open maps that simulate the world much better than its very linear successor, Crysis 2. In that regard, it is even better than Crysis 3.\n\nThe game was one of the best action games of 2007 but did not have many sales due to high specifications, hardware requirements and DirectX 10. It has two Secuels . Crysis 2 and Crysis 3 .\nWhile Crysis 3 surpasses some of its graphic , 1 remains the best game of the 3 .\n\nThe game was released for Windows PC , PS3 and XBOX 360 before being ported to MAC OSX.","January 25, 2014","true","5.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It takes some unexpected twists and turns along the way, and it does lead to a fairly interesting conclusion, but all in all it's clear that this is a game of gameplay over story. If you want something with a story that will rival franchises like Half-Life or Bioshock, you're looking in the wrong place. The story of all the Crysis games combined serves only one purpose, and that purpose is to give you a reason for going from A to B if wanderlust alone isn't going to cut it.\n\nNow then, how is the gameplay?\n\nThe gameplay is great. It's everything you expect in a modern shooter - Decent-to-good AI, a nice selection of satisfying weaponry, explosives and gadgets. The Nano-Suit turns out to be one of the most interesting features in any FPS since the Gravity Gun, and the game is ripe for multiple playthroughs thanks to all of your options and the, at times, huge maps that you can get lost in. Crysis is perhaps the flagship of what a liniear open-world game can be - No, you're never really 'free' but you don't feel like you're being pushed through a bottleneck - because you're not! What Crysis likes to do is to give you a fairly simply objective, a huge map, and then basically leave it up to you as to how you go about completing your mission. You can go in guns blazing, blowing up enemies left, right and center, or you can play it like you would any stealth game, capitalizing on your ability to turn invisible.\n\nGraphically there's not really much to say. You can pick up and play this game today, and you won't be disappointed. Even by our current standards, this game arguably looks better than a lot of new releases. The low pricetag also means that it's going to outclass a lot of otherwise very competent indi-shooters.\n\nDefinitely an all-time classic for me, and in my opinion the best game in the series.\n\n","February 21, 2015","true","10.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I could do it for days.\n\nI like games which seem relatistic in that they are set in a earth like world but have fantasy or sci-fi elements in them.  Like in Half-life you fight humans and Aliens which is perfect as just one or the other does become boring. COD for example.\n\nAll in all for me this game is second only to Half-Life and even beats it in some ways. The first Crysis game is easily the best the second and third have the feel of rushed COD style sequels about them but are still superb.\n\nOn the whole Crysis is one of the best games ever made and if you havnt played it then why the hell not?\n\n9/10 Utterly effing Brilliant.","March 4","true","65.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Unfortunately, although it is a decent and mildly enjoyable game, I can't personally recommend Crysis.\n\nWhat I had thought would be a unique experience turned out to be a run-of-the-mill, fairly generic First-Person Shooter that failed to draw me in.  The suit mechanics are the game's strong point, as they are entertaining to use, but the rest of the game is quite lackluster in comparison.  As I played, it seemed to me that what got this game its hype was, by and large, the advanced graphical features of its day.  On this end, I will say that the game still holds up even eight years later.  The game looked good and the animations were smooth.\n\nAs I stated previously, this is not a bad game, just one that no longer stands out for anything in particular.  If you're a huge fan of First-Person Shooters and need another to hold you over to the next release, I'd say go ahead and get it.  If you're looking for a new experience that's going to keep you enthralled for the length of the game, I would look elsewhere.","July 20, 2015","false","2.6"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

The game literally crashed or froze on me 6 times during installation and in the menus, before I even got to the game itself. If I make any changes in the menu at all, it immediately crashes. I mean, I changed the suit voice from male to female and the game crashed. Changed from windowed to full screen...crash. Changed resolution...crash. ANY change will cause the game to crash. Not only that, there's a checkpoint system, a relic from consoles, that causes the game to freeze for 5 seconds every time you hit one of those checkpoints. So far I've hit one of those checkpoints about once every 3 minutes.\n\nI, therefore, cannot recommend this broken game and I can't believe it's being sold for money. I can't ever see myself finishing this game with all these crashes and freezes.

On one hand, this game - back in 2007 - showed the superior power of PC processing power. On the other hand; good luck trying to run the game on a modern PC. The sad thing that I encoutered with this game was the fact that I had an easier time play this game on my xbox 360, then I had on my PC, that was made in 2014. This was due to the game seeming inability to run on a modern operating system, without the help of a user made patch for the game. Though at best the patch only seemed to be a tempory fix to the problem, and for seemingly no reason; I would have to download the patch again before I could get the game to work again. Eventually I just gave up on the game, and unistalled it from my library, which was a damn shame too, since for the most part the gameplay was pretty good. I Thought that it was better than it's sequels, at least until the aliens showed, and unruined any need for stealth in the game, and don't get me started on that damnable helicopter flying sequence near the end.\n\nAll in All, if you can get the game to run with no fus, then I can tell you at least that you are in for a mostly good game. Otherwise scan over information, in discussions, or ask if your systems OS can even come close to running the game before purchasing it.\n","August 28, 2015","false","11.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Not to mention there was a particular issue I had with the penultimate mission where it would randomly crash to the desktop.

That's no secret. Beyond that, the shooting is competent and the nano suit adds a nice flavor to the game. It would be a pretty fun game if not for its glaring flaws. So let's dive into those.\n\nThe game is poorly optimized. It looks great, but similarly good looking games run better. I'm using a 4770k @ 4.6 GHz and an overclocked GTX 970. It runs very well on max with 4x AA in most situations, but it occasionally lags, especially against aliens with their numerous projectile effects.\n\nCrysis can't seem to pick a difficulty and stick with it. You'll go fifteen minutes of easy gameplay, and suddenly it's impossibly difficult. The autosaves are few and far between, so you'll need to stay on top of that yourself. Assuming you don't die in a particularly difficult situation, you might die to any of the numerous bugs.\n\nThat's right. The game is HORRIBLY buggy. Here is a nice list of terrible deaths and game-breaking bugs I encountered on a single playthrough:\n- Bumped into an object that is subject to phsysics. It collided funny and I was instantly killed by it, from full health, with 100% on armor.\n- Randomly fell over dead on numerous occasions, no enemies nearby, full health, no mines.\n- Vehicle bumps something at an odd angle, explodes.\n- Clipped through a floor and into a fire.\n- The second-to-last mission finished and crashed the game. Again. And again. I had to use a command console code to advance to the final mission.\n- The final mission allows you to progress beyond something that is necessary to finish it, causing you to have to restart the mission.\n\nThe list could go on. I'm sure there are plenty I even forgot.\n\nBeyond the bugs, the game itself is just frustrating. The ground shooting segments are usually good, but the vehicle segments are some of the worst I've ever played. The VTOL is unresponsive and clunky, made even worse by tornados that just throw you to the ground. The tank mission is entirely too difficult at times. There is an escort mission where your friendly has to keep warm, and he twice failed to keep up with me and stand near a fire, getting himself killed.\n\nThere is a lot of good in this game, but there are a lot of things so poorly executed, it clearly overshadows the good. Unless you're a masochist, do not buy this game.","October 29, 2015","false","14.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

I suppose I was fairly sold on the novelty of owning "the benchmark game" at the time. However, I never really played it. Only a few weak attempts every now and again, but I never made any real progress.\n\nThat said, I finally took the time to play through the game. I was kind of on the fence as to whether or not I'd recommend the title. I don't think so, not anymore.\n\nIt's a beautiful game, but it's poorly optimized in most cases. The graphical fidelity is the only thing of note about this game, I think. The rest of it is nothing to write home about. The characters are shallow and cliche. The plot leaves much to be desired. The game is short, and can probably be beaten in around 6-7 hours if you know what you're doing. Maybe even quicker. The last level is UNBELIEVABLY glitchy. There are SO many glitches in that last level that can prevent you from beating the game entirely.  Back in the day this game would arguably be incredibly popular simply due to the graphics, but unfortunately the graphics are the only thing that's held up since its release.\n","November 14, 2015","false","20.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And that's what pisses me off, because they got a lot of things right, but for everything they got right, they get 14 other things wrong.  First of all aiming is atrocious and I play with a controller, second driving is godawful and I hate the part where they FORCE YOU TO DRIVE A TANK WHILE THE A.I SNIPES YOU WITH F****** ROCKET LAUNCHERS!  Also the characters are so bland I probably won't remember their names after writing this review. The story is decent at times but there are huge plot holes in that too which I will list at the end. Also the difficulty is ridiculous, especially the final boss, who is only difficult because of random a** Michael Bay level explosions that kill you in a second and have no warning whatsoever, also the alien freeze ray thing is B.S.\n\nI had to look online to figure out how to get unstuck, there was no button prompt for that.  The game's ending is also atrocious after dealing with two godawful, no fun, and above all lazy boss fights and by lazy I mean bosses that look cool but are so boring and not fun that you wouldn't want to ever fight them again, the ending doesn't feel like an ending. To be fair I am aware of Crysis 2 and 3 but honestly you can give us a better ending than just the main character saying "No we get back in the fight" drop ship door closes thee end. Also the final boss feels more like a middle boss because SPOILER ALERT: YOU SPEND NEARLY 2 -THIRDS OF THE GAME FIGHTING KOREANS IN A JUNGLE AND ABOUT THE LAST 3RD OF THE GAME FIGHTING THE ALIENS!!!\n\nIf I wanted to fight Korean soldiers with an assault rifle I'd just play COD like everybody else (I hate COD by the way), I expected to be fighting aliens within the first 3-4 levels but wrong they don't come till the end. Granted the aliens are fun, the first few times you fight them, until you realize there are only 2 TYPES OF ALIENS IN THE ENTIRE GAME EXCLUDING 2 BOSSES!!!!\n\nAnd the only difference? One is big and flies above and rains needler-like blades on you from above and can take a lot of damage, the other? Smaller, shoots at you with smaller projectiles, and bum-rushes you for quick stabs.

And that's what pisses me off, because they got a lot of things right, but for everything they got right, they get 14 other things wrong.  First of all aiming is atrocious and I play with a controller, second driving is godawful and I hate the part where they FORCE YOU TO DRIVE A TANK WHILE THE A.I SNIPES YOU WITH F****** ROCKET LAUNCHERS!  Also the characters are so bland I probably won't remember their names after writing this review. The story is decent at times but there are huge plot holes in that too which I will list at the end. Also the difficulty is ridiculous, especially the final boss, who is only difficult because of random a** Michael Bay level explosions that kill you in a second and have no warning whatsoever, also the alien freeze ray thing is B.S.\n\nI had to look online to figure out how to get unstuck, there was no button prompt for that.  The game's ending is also atrocious after dealing with two godawful, no fun, and above all lazy boss fights and by lazy I mean bosses that look cool but are so boring and not fun that you wouldn't want to ever fight them again, the ending doesn't feel like an ending. To be fair I am aware of Crysis 2 and 3 but honestly you can give us a better ending than just the main character saying "No we get back in the fight" drop ship door closes thee end. Also the final boss feels more like a middle boss because SPOILER ALERT: YOU SPEND NEARLY 2 -THIRDS OF THE GAME FIGHTING KOREANS IN A JUNGLE AND ABOUT THE LAST 3RD OF THE GAME FIGHTING THE ALIENS!!!\n\nIf I wanted to fight Korean soldiers with an assault rifle I'd just play COD like everybody else (I hate COD by the way), I expected to be fighting aliens within the first 3-4 levels but wrong they don't come till the end. Granted the aliens are fun, the first few times you fight them, until you realize there are only 2 TYPES OF ALIENS IN THE ENTIRE GAME EXCLUDING 2 BOSSES!!!!\n\nAnd the only difference? One is big and flies above and rains needler-like blades on you from above and can take a lot of damage, the other? Smaller, shoots at you with smaller projectiles, and bum-rushes you for quick stabs. BORING.\n\nEverything falls apart in the final act, the first level outside with the aliens is phenomenal it's one of the best levels I've played in a shooter in a while, I felt like I was in some Summer Blockbuster, and I was excited to see where the rest of the game was going (I expected a solid 3 -4 hours of alien fighting) and then the aircraft carrier level takes a steaming turd on it.\n\nSPOILER'S AHEAD PLOT GRIPES:\n\n-The fact that your team leader Prophet learns how to hot-wire an alien gun to use against the aliens is never addressed.\n-Generic evil Korean villain for half the game serves no purpose but to be filler for when aliens show up and is also sent off in a weak boss fight.\n-Your character has the personality of a turnip, hell nearly everyone does.\n-U.S decides to use nukes to solve everything cliche, (called it about a full hour before it happens)\n-Aliens don't show up till like the last 2-3 levels instead of midway through the game like one would think.\n-Main character walks into nuclear powered aircraft carrier reactor core and lowers the rods and does not suffer from radiation poisoning or any sort of side effects because nanosuit.\n-Your boss leaves the aircraft carrier because he knows the nuke will fail and heads back to the island to fight instead of helping stop them from destroying your entire fleet.\n-Ending is not an ending, it's like they cut a much larger game in half.\n\nSPOILER'S END HERE:\n\nFinal Verdict?: A strong 5.5/10\n\nOVERRATED AS F***!!!!!","April 1, 2015","false","13.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There were a few bugs here and there but even compared to graphics in some games now-a-days it's pretty impressive I would give a warning to anyone using 64bit windows as if it doesn't work you will have to find the same solution that I did (search run crysis in 64 bit) anyway here are the pros and cons:\n\npros:\n- Graphics & sounds are great\n- Gameplay is hard but very satisfying to explore the world and abuse the armour abilities\n- Armour abilities feel more used than in the other 2 crysis games (in my opinion)\n- The story is good, and not too basic, it is something that is impossible, but feels as though it might be possible (hard to describe)\n- World doesn't feel cramped like other shooters\n- Gameplay style is all your choice: from tactical stealth to total devastating running and gunning (though would recommend easier difficulty for more running and gunning)\n\ncons:\n- as mentioned before, it is a risky purchase for 64 bit windows as a solution doesn't always work...\n- Some parts can seem almost impossible to get past\n- Final boss battle can glitch out, meaning you have to do the whole thing again\n- 2 objects in the game have weird graphics glitches when you walk past them (might just be me)\n\nI'm pretty sure that's it for my review, hope I've helped make a decision :) just be careful if you are purchasing this game from a 64 bit of windows, and if you are and at first it didn't work, I hope the solution works for you!\n","August 19, 2014","true","12.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay is awesome. I am not a big fan of FPS, but what really kept me enjoying it was the atmosphere, very realistic, then at the same time very futuristic.\n\nI enjoyed it thoroughly and beat it. Not sure how many hours it took( I had to disable the steam overlay as it causes some bugs.), but it definately was awhile, pretty big game\n\nFor being 7 years old the graphics deliver and still tax a system. For the price you can get it nowadays I definately recommend it.

Graphically it set the new standard when it was released... presenting lush tropical environments, photo realistic underwater visuals, etc etc.  There is no question that the eye candy is here.  However, the gameplay is also fantastic.  Environments are vast and open, and objectives can be tackled in a variety of ways.  AI is actually intelligent and will pull off some interesting flanking moves.  The story isn't exactly original, but its well executed.  Multiplayer is too complex making it somewhat less accessible, but worth the single player experience. A must purchase for every FPS fan.","October 30, 2011","true","6.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Because this is a rare case of an older game that's aged so well graphically, that it actually looks better than it did when it came out!\n\nLet me explain. Remember the old "Can it run Crysis" meme? Back when this game was first released in 2007, very few PC's could handle the "High" settings of this game at resolutions higher than 1024x768 and maintain a playable framerate, and even fewer of them could handle the "Very High" settings at framerates higher than slideshow speed at any resolution! (The fact that at the time, the "Very High" settings were only available to users of Vista, which already had trouble running on most PC's to begin with, really didn't help...)\n\nTimes have definitely changed. It's now very common for gaming PC's to have a lot more than 2GB of RAM (the official "recommended" amount for this game), and to say that Graphics Card and CPU performance has improved allot since 2007 would be an understatement. So, now that we have access to much better hardware, we can now see all the little details that Crytek stuffed into this game and still maintain a playable framerate!\n\n(Edit: I forgot to mention that while this game is "hardware" future-proof, I'll admit that it isn't so much software wise unfortunately. Make sure that you apply this patch if you are running a 64-bit Windows version, or else the game might crash on startup: https://steamcommunity.com/app/17300/discussions/0/864945401070748061/)","May 29, 2015","true","23.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The combat is smooth and very complex, thanks to the ubiquitous nano-suit, which can help you run at superhuman speeds, punch through walls (or kill enemies with one blow from a toilet brush), or turn invisible for a short period of time. The settings vary considerably, from the almost-tropical beaches to the icy mountains of the Lingshan Islands. Weapon selection was good, and only improved when the Aliens were unleashed (Molecular Accelerator or Gauss Rifle, anyone?). It should also be pointed out that the plot shift from focus on North Korea to the Alien threat was a pleasant surprise, as it changed things up before they became too boring. The story was not that great, and the characters rather pathetic in their own right (save for Psycho), but hey! When the action is this good, who's complaining? Great weapons customization options (each weapon can be tailored to the individual players' needs). The vehicular combat was not spectacular, but another game made by Crytek down the line will address that...\n9/10","September 8, 2015","true","57.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You play as a futuristic Super-soldier with the ability to turn invisible or turn your Armor on to resist bullets.\n\nThis game is semi-open world and gives you the option for multiple ways to take down your enemies. The combat is fun and engaging, and definitely keeps you on your toes. You can only carry a handful of weapons at a time, you constantly need to monitor your suit's energy usage, and you never know when there's a hidden sniper waiting in a tree for you.\n\nThe game allows you to roll with your own playstyle if you prefer to run in with Armor and a shotgun or stealth through the bushes with a long range rifle. The weapons are all responsive and unique, and customizable to suit yourself. I found myself struggling to decide which ones I wanted to keep with me.\n\nThe environment is beautiful, the entire island is rich and looks like they put a lot of effort into it. The areas where you make enemy contact are designed for fun firefights with lots of movement and interaction with the environment--especially when some of it is destructible.\n\nHowever, the game is a bit repetitive and there are only like 2 boss fights, so a lot of your time is spent running around the island and dealing with more normal enemies, with a few breaks in the monotony. Also about 2/3 of the way through the game, the focus is shifted more towards fighting aliens instead of the human enemies, which changes the gameplay a little bit.\n\nStill, it was a fun adventure, a good FPS, and interesting story.","April 14","true","10.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WorthAShot/recommended/17300/","WorthAShot","Worth A Shot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WorthAShot/","88 products in account","Crysis is this game.\nCrysis Warhead is a psuedo sequel, the same time frame played from your buddy's perspective.\nCrysis Wars is defunct multiplayer.\nCrysis 2 is the proper sequel but plays very differently than the above.\nCrysis 3 (and 4) are on "Origin" not Steam.\n\nBackground:\nCrysis was the benchmark in PC graphics for a very long time.  It's 2016 and this game still looks fairly decent.  Probably the first game I've ever played where a forest feels like a real forest.  Way ahead of its time and most people's hardware.  Unfortunately it also missed out on a lot of optimization potential that later games got right.  Even with a GTX 970 with comparable SSD+processor this game loads slowly and did have issues in an aerial sequence.  I had settings almost maxed (keep that motion blur disabled thanks) except for the aerial bit.  The UI is terrible and every session I had to put fullscreen back on.\n\nGameplay:\nThis is an oldschool first person military shooter with sandbox elements and regular cut scenes.  You start off with all suit powers (hold middle click and drag in a direction):\n- default is armor which includes faster health regen\n- then cloak is overpowered (drains power as you move and drops if you attack) yet fails at melee range.\n- strength makes you jump higher and absorb more falling damage\n- speed makes you run faster, really fast for a short time\n\nGood to know stuff:\nFalling damage can kill (use strength to minimize).  The suit lets you breath underwater.  There's also a separate night vision that drains a separate power meter.  Armored vehicles require explosives to destroy.  You can only carry three kinds of weapons at a time, but can swap on the fly and recall a previous weapon's ammo pool (which is the only reason to swap late game).  Health is regenerative but the meter is on screen.  In this iteration, ammo pickups are totally manual.  Crouch and fully prone are separate functions.  WHENEVER YOU GET IN A VEHICLE HIT F1 FOR THIRD PERSON!  No achievements or collectibles, just secondary objectives with no impact aside from providing another ammo cache.  Relatively short compared to today's titles (9-15 hours).\n\nVerdict:\nCrysis was a great game in its time.  It's an oldschool precursor to the Call of Duty franchise.  But if that's what you're hoping for, you won't enjoy this.  The game is fairly unforgiving (though stealth is an obvious option) and there are a few really annoying aspects.  Ammo, enemy, and suit power management are a must.  Play on easy if you are at all worried, you will still die a bunch.  It's polished but not streamlined; if you played any of the other games (which included many quality of play improvements) you might want to skip this one.\n\nPsuedo spoilers "what are you getting into":\nThe game has several innovative sequences, but that could also be a source of frustration as the game starts off almost sandbox then gets fairly linear.  The game shifts in tone and even play style half way through, leading me to miss the earlier sections of assaulting Korean bases.  The ending absolutely has a nice final boss for a climax, but then acts like one of the next games will pick up your character's life a few minutes later.  They don't, making that sort of a cliffhanger.\n\nBottom line:  Worth $4","May 17","true","15.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The visuals were, obviously, stellar, but it was much more than that. Over time, the gameplay became… customizable. You could stealth in the middle of a group of enemies, grab one by the throat, throw him, drop a trip-mine, and run away before they even knew you were there. You were Batman mixed with the Predator mixed with The Flash, and it was freaking incredible.

Character who has a a super advanced suit that gives him super speed and strength and is part of some elite taskforce can't aim a gun without it shaking everywhere so it's impossible to do precision shots. Enemies will spot you no matter how conceled you are, OH yeah. You have to use the cloak to sneak which burns out in a few seconds so it's useless. I can't complain about the story since I quit after the first mission because of how garbage the gameplay is. The controller set up and is garbage and is configured really awkwardly and for some reason you can't change that.

I did like one of the levels though and do appreciate some of the mechanics although what really killed the game were all the crashes. This game crashed so many times it became unbearable to the point where I was about to quit. Luckily I held on and finished it but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone one else.

While the game surely has some memorable moment they don't justify the poor A.I with nearly pinpoint accuracy, graphical glitches and a forgettable story.\n\nIf anything, Crysis is - or was - only meant to stress hardware and see just what your system is capable of, nothing more.","October 19, 2013","false","2.5"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","5","16","0","0"

"All flash no substance". That would be the ideal description. Crysis is touted for its amazing graphics, and that's probably the ONLY thing this game has going for it. Especially for the time it was released it was indeed groundbreaking graphics wise, but other than that, Crysis is derivative, and repetitive. It's mindless shooting at its finest. The gameplay is simplistic, story is stupid, and cutscenes are horrendous. Bad voice acting, often voice is out of sync with craracters actions making certain things look plain stupid. Only i nthe end of the game does the story pick up and offer a somewhat interesting twist, but nothign we havent seen before. Crysis is shooting the same enemies in different environments with same weapons, again, and again and again, without anyhting new actually ever happening. If you cna get this game for $5 try it, its a destraction, if nothign more. But at a higher price, please, save your money. Crysis is more of a graphics demostration and a system benchmark rather than a game.","January 1, 2014","false","14.8"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","5"

The graphics that once looked so lifelike look like they were pasted on to give the illusion of looking lifelike. Grab an enemy and look at his face, you can see where the video file was essentially pasted onto the characters face. Their actual movement animations look pretty bad now. The water still looks absoutely gorgeous though, and the game's graphics do have their moments still. But don't expect your brand new 2013 super computer to be able to run this 2007 monster any better. You'll still get some pretty poor performance as soon as you hit that snow part.\n\nThe gameplay itself was never that great. A very small arsenal of weapons to choose from, made only smaller due to the fact that the enemies only use AK's, Uzis, and Shotguns so you'll be stuck using their guns since there's rarely any way to replenish the other weapons in the game like the Scar. And once you get to the part with the aliens.. forget it. The gameplay is terrible. Bad hit registration, barely having any indication of how much damage you're doing to enemies, repetition. The end fight is pretty epic, but this game still comes off as just an advertisement for Cryteks graphics engine in 2007.\n\nHonestly, Crysis 2 and Crysis 3 have better gameplay because they're more finely focused on it rather than putting all their eggs in the graphics basket.","December 29, 2013","false","10.1"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

Played it for the first time and after playing Crysis 2 i must say they definitly made improvements from the original. For starters the game looks great. You can immediatly tell why this was a PC Breaking game back in 2011. Graphics with water, fog, and lighting are amazing to look at and the environments are varied and exciting. Gameplay is where is seems to be the jumble of good and bad. The combat is tight and responds well however the driving is crap and the flight missions downright stupid. The waypoints system works at times but in others i found myself running around looking for the right path to take in the later levels. sometimes there was absolutly no direction unless I opened my objectives tab and read the fine print. NOW we hit the big problem with this game. The difficulty spikes are incredibly crushing to the point of infuriation. Cheap ♥♥♥ deaths from instant killing enemies that you cant see are increasingly frustrating especially when you have the suits armor on and at full health. WTF Crytek. give us the tools but they dont help with them at all? Disappointingly frustating difficullty in an otherwise pretty and competant shooter.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nowatercolours/recommended/17300/","nowatercolours","sik maems","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nowatercolours/","120 products in account","I remember the times of old when Crysis was used to benchmark everything. It's a game I fondly remember for it's brillant and fun gameplay with gorgeous visuals that put modern games to shame but it's far from perfect.\n\nGraphically, it was easily the most taxing game when it came out. "Can it run Crysis on max?" was a common way to judge a computer's performance, and rightly so, it's a intense game to run. Although released in 2007, it still looks gorgeous. The Lingshan Islands feel like very realistic in it's scope and detail. Texture quality rivals, if not outright better than, modern textures, and lighting effects are done to perfect. All in all, it's visually stunning. Worthy to note is the interactivity of objects in the game. The ability to shoot at enemies in cover and destroy their cover completely is realistic and not to mention being able to break most objects in game. Houses, fences, trees and cars are all destructable and this should be abused to the best of your abilities.\n\nGameplay wise, it's a sandbox, first person shooter, and arguably the best of it's genre. Guns feel like they have a real kick to them and the shotgun especially feels immensely satifisying to use compared to modern first person shooters. The nanosuit has 4 but all very distinct and useful "modes". All 4 modes use energy, an automatically recharging resource, to power their actions. Power mode allows for steadier aim, stronger melee attacks and higher jumps[/spoiler]. Armor modes allows damage to be absorbed via energy. Speed mode allows for faster movement in every situation including walking, crouched walking, running and even moving up ladders (not to mention a ridiculously fast sprint). Finally Cloak mode allows for limited invisibility. However, being tied to a limit and ever draining resource, there is an art to using the functions of the nanosuit. It's immensely satisfying to cloak into cover behind an enemy, switch to power mode, headshot, and then use speed mode to quickly sprint away into new cover. There's also a bit of depth into the mechanincs of the nanosuit, and the game doesn't hold your hand into it. It never tells you to use power mode when you're trying to snipe at long distances, or to use speed mode sprinting while swimming or in zero-g environments to move rapidly. Guns feature on-the-fly customisation, and you can tailor each gun to each specific circumstance, such as adding a silencer with a sniper scope on your assault rifle to act as a long range sniper, or switch it up with a reflex scope and grenade launcher for drawn out firefights. There are a few vehicles to use including tanks, military jeeps and even VTOLs but they're nothing really special apart from using jeeps in creative ways to kill KPA soldiers in the first half of the game.\n\nStorywise, it's very barebones. You're sent to investigate an island who have american researchers taken hostage by the North Korean military (KPA or Korean People's Army). It then is revealed that an alien race is lying dormant with the KPA trying to use them as an limitless energy source. This backfires and instead wakes the aliens and the US military arrives to try and stop them before they contact their homeworld for reinforcements.\n\nThe few main characters are lively and full of character, especially your squadmates of Raptor Team. Their voice actors do a terrific job putting so much personality into them, including the voice actors for quite a lot of the characters you'll meet. Although there is an exception. Helena Rosenthal was done by Claudia Black, responsible for Chloe in the Uncharted Series and Morrigan in the DA series. She does an okay job in those, but she is absolutely awful in Crysis. Whenever Helena's voice comes on it's like a nails on a chalk board. Absolutely jarring and breaks your immersion. You really have to think how the production team okayed this, when the other characters like Psycho or Prophet are done so well.\n\nHowever the game is ultimately flawed in many aspects that take away from the experience. The first half of the game is a brillant open world FPS that allows for creative ways to approach every objective. Abusing Cloak feels cheap, but mastery is difficult to achieve resulting in a rather balanced experience. You can still end up in a terrible position with no energy to absorb hits if you don't position properly which means instant death at the higher difficulties. Enemies can also spot you while cloaked if you move in close proximity to them and even while remaining still if they're in touching range. Personally, I play this like a Predator simulator, and it's immensely satifisying to cloak in and out, while headshotting soldiers undetected and causing an alert to go off while you continute to flank and pick soliders off one by one. Unfortunately once you reach the second half of the game, it becomes a completely different game. After you reach the mines and the alien temple within, it becomes a linear FPS with bullet sponge enemies (The aliens you'll fight, the KPA nanosuit soliders aren't so bad). While this isn't bad on it's own, you have to play a completely different style. You can't stealth kill (as in cloaking and headshotting) and so you are forced to shoot behind cover, ducking to recover your armor. I wouldn't mind this in it's own game, but to lose that sense of freedom and ability to play as you see fit from the first half, is a real shame. The game also suffers from numerous bugs, including odd physics interactions like a fallen tree shaking and walking into it causing instant death, falling into the floor of the USS Constitution and getting stuck and the infamous bug where you crash upon trying to load a game (which you can fix by deleting the most recent save in your savegame folder).\n\nAll in all, it's an immensely fun game to play with multiple ways to play it as you see fit. The visuals are gorgeous and constant screenshot worthy moments. Although there are a few bugs (some almost game breaking), the overall experience is worth to chug through them. I would advise to replay the first half after finishing the game though, you'll see just how much more fun it was if you didn't notice it already.","November 28, 2014","true","15.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Worked fine for me (Win 7 64bit) other than the DirectX 10 mode (it's not enabled by default) end battle bugged out a little.\n\nThe gameplay is solid, the weapons feel good, the suit makes the game unique and you can decide I you wanna go the incredible hulk on the enemies butt or sneak around places invisible and sniping them. The AI felt like it knew what it was doing.\n\nThe story I liked too and its lead on nicely. It might be a little basic by some peoples standards, but I liked it more than Half-Life 2. I really liked the alien turnaround point too. And there's a reason for you being the badass you are cause you have the nanosuit and you're a soldier by training.\n\nAnd graphics are amazing for a game this "old".

The game play is also quite good, with a variety of vehicles and weapons to choose from throughout the game.\n\nUnfortunately, the prettiness and good game play doesn't make up for the somewhat short storyline in the single player game, easily completable in sixteen hours.

Crysis is the real "sequel" to Far Cry. To be fair it's not a sequel, and not necessarily  in the same "universe". It's simply to say if you enjoyed the original Far Cry you will like this. The "Crysis Suit" is a little over marketed if you ask me because you'll spend most  of the time in "damage soak" mode, and switching during combat at least to me didn't seem feasible. As with all shooters it's not super plot heavy, however the story in general is intriguing , and the increasing buildup of strange activity on the island will keep you going.

Whilst Crysis doesn't complete escape a linear format, it does offer you secondary objectives and lets you tackle things from multiple angles. Fancy going in guns blazing? You can do that. Want to be sneaky and take out enemies silently or avoid them completely? Sure, go for it. The environments are varied so you never feel that you're just going through the motions, and adaptability is to key to survival.\n\nWhichever way you play Crysis, it's a thoroughly enjoyable game and the great sound and music fit the moments perfectly, notching up the tension and then exploding into action if the preverbal hits the fan. Graphically, Crysis was well-known for bringing the best pixel-pushers to their knees, and even today, it looks mighty impressive. I played on 'high' and the texture quality, lighting and character animations look superb. I played through the story in 8 hours, which is standard fare for a game of this type.\n\nCrysis does a lot of things very well, but all this is nearly destroyed toward the end of the game, as the final chapter is buggier than the Amazon rainforest. Falling through the ground to your death makes it incredibly frustrating and damn-near impossible to complete the game. When I made it to the final boss, the scripted-sequence failed and I had to reload a previous save, forcing me to do the battle all over again.\n\nEdit: I was able to get around some of the clipping issues by forcing the game to run in DX9 mode, but this didn't always work. I had to jump and hope that I landed on solid ground.\n\nDespite the bugs, I'd still recommend Crysis. It was thoroughly enjoyable and, final chapter aside, it's a highly polished game.","January 24, 2014","true","28.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to\nbe proactive in the battlefield. You have to be flexible, quick & also think tactical.\n(+) 	 The overall graphics (which is still standout nowadays) is more than eye-candy.\n(+)	  Outstanding O.S.T. compositions (actually at the moment while I'm writing this review, I'm listening Inon Zur - Crysis    O.S.T. tracks).\nI love it.\n(+)	  The storyline scientific, exciting and bursts.

However, if the player is looking for a smooth transition from beginning to end, they will fall a bit short. Game difficulty moves far too quickly from cakewalk to hell on Earth and back again too quick and far too often. Progressive difficulty is expected with any game. It naturally makes the game imersive so the player doesn't get bored. Finding levels later in game which seem nearly impossible only to move on to levels that are about as difficult as a tutorial is a bit much. Some levels you don't even have a damn clue what you're doing. For instance *spoiler alert!*...you end up in a different world a long time ago in a far away land. For some reason suddenly the gravity turns off. Ok...so I have thrusters. Didn't know that. Why the hell don't they help me jump higher along with the strength ability? Anyways...you'll find yourself inside this thing...we have no clue what it is. Some sort of factory? No clue. Enemies will be flying around you and giant bolts of electricity will be doing the funky chicken along the walls. So you try to figure out what you need to do. More and more bolts of electricity are forming and you start to wonder if the last 5 min you've spent in the area is all for nothing because you can't figure out what you're supposed to do. No...thats not it at all. Its a countdown to a portal that is going to whisk you away. So it turns out its a waiting game. Anyways, *end of spoiler!*\n\nPROS:\n-You get an awesome suit with different abilities which are not only fun to play with they are a must to complete missions.\n-The learning curve is surprisingly fast.\n-Good graphics. Honestly though even for its time...I don't see what all the fuss was about.\n-It is one of the better single player FPS experiences out there.\n\nCONS:\n-3 main guns until right near the end. At which point you're so happy to pull the trigger of a new gun you nearly have an 0rg@smic moment which can only be bested by finding the 3rd warp whistle in Mario 3 when you're 12.\n-On the later guns...(oh yes I'm not done!)...what is described as basically a nuke in a shotgun's body needs a Ph D and 20 yrs experience from Nasa JPL just to figure out how to work the damn thing and figuring out what to aim it at to make it work.\n-*spolier alert* Aliens...not just regular aliens like E.T., Jarjar Binks, Predator, or Padme' Ama f'in dala (yes she was an alien...technically...a rather hot one at that,) these aliens are deadly flying around in Zero G. They are deadly (mostly 1 hit kills) on the ground. They blow up when dead. They pilot some serious hardware. Why the hell do they need all this? They can kill Billy King Badass in his super Badass suit with bare hands.\n-3 weapons.\n-Being invisible doesn't last as long as it should. In many ways it is nearly pointless. More invisible time=more fun.\n-Multiplayer is dead.\n-3  ♥♥♥1ng guns.

Worked fine for me (Win 7 64bit) other than the DirectX 10 mode (it's not enabled by default) end battle bugged out a little.\n\nThe gameplay is solid, the weapons feel good, the suit makes the game unique and you can decide I you wanna go the incredible hulk on the enemies butt or sneak around places invisible and sniping them. The AI felt like it knew what it was doing.\n\nThe story I liked too and its lead on nicely. It might be a little basic by some peoples standards, but I liked it more than Half-Life 2. I really liked the alien turnaround point too. And there's a reason for you being the badass you are cause you have the nanosuit and you're a soldier by training.\n\nAnd graphics are amazing for a game this "old".

Great story line and some cool characters. But most of all, some really nice mechanics and AI that allow you to play however you want. Most of the game does not seem insanely linear, in that you can choose many different paths to the objective. Also when your fighting the humans; because of the AI and mechanics, you can go through the level without killing anyone if you want to. So i would highly recommend this game for those stealthy sniper types. The only complaints i have about this game are: some of the alien fights are a bit scripted and maybe just a tad to hard to pull off right away but there aren't many of them, the steam version didn't come with 64 bit...but a few extra steps will get that running, and my last complaint is the game feels pretty short and ends right when you feel motivated to kick some alien ♥♥♥.","September 3, 2012","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
