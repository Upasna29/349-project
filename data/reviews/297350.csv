They are pretty big themes, yes, but TOC:L works on the assumption that videogame players should be allowed to tackle such big themes without having to quit their hobby.\n\nThe game got criticized for the supposedly pretentious and overly obscure, rather cryptic, writing and, certainly, Leviathan would have benefited, as a game, from a toning down of its technical vocabulary ("Truth must be compatible with itself.") and a slightly simplified flow of ideas: the part about the boy in the library is interesting, but rather superfluous in the game's narrative, even though it accounts for the feeling of self-taught philosophy, which is, of course, what the game is all about, but it does make it feel cumbersome at times, it lacks the brilliance of a game with a clearer grasp on the philosophical themes it deploys, like The Talos Principle, for instance (then again, philosophy of the mind is much more marketable as part of a videogame setting than ontology or gnosiology).\n\nDespite all this, I think the way the game is written is also a well calculated effect: its central allegory presents the philosopher as a Minotaur, lost in his own interior labyrinths of thought, trying to mediate a fragile peace, a sort of fickle equillibrium between contraries of human nature (represented in the game as three conflicting factions, each with its own goals and reasons; also, this mediation the Minotaurs are doing between factions takes various forms in the game, according to the different schools of thought in the history of philosophy). So, the apparently cumbersome writing is meant to recreate for the player the feeling of being lost in such a labyrith of words, is meant to make the player feel like they are the Minotaur, and they are actually "thinking" their way out, navigating a sea of ideas (the metaphor of "sailing" is also a very powerful one in the game's mythological symbolism), wading slowly through them in search of "enlightenment", and if you play it the way it's supposed to be "played", slowly, meditatively, with open eyes and an open mind, it does make you feel enlightened at the end.\n\nWith its deep, philosophical, themes, metaphorical storytelling, complete lack of gameplay, meditative exploration and contemplative level design The Old City: Leviathan could very well mark the birth of a new type of videogames: The First Person Thinker. I'd like to see it develop into a full-fledged genre in the coming years.","June 18, 2015","true","16.6"," 87 of 90 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","87","90","2","15"

If only that were true. If only I was above all this, instead of beneath everything..."\n\nThe Old City: Leviathan is a project I've been following for a while now. It captured my attention from the moment I read that it focused entirely on story and exploration without the obsessive combat or jumpscares that plagues the common formula for big-budget-quick-profit games today. My intrigue was instantly sated from the moment I ran the game. I'm obsessed. It's an addicting breath of fresh air that is so desperately needed amongst today's games.\n\nThis game instead slows you down, sets you free to explore, and unfolds its story through its beautifully crafted environment. It places its trust in human curiosity, and quickly ensnares you in its abstract, fragmented story told through the eyes and ramblings of a madman. Everything done and narrated in this game is terrifyingly meaningful and deep. The intellectual depth and immersion of this game is just absolutely stunning, and combines for one remarkable experience.\n\nThis is the kind of game that makes you want to write down everything you see, every question you have, and every reoccuring object in hopes of piecing everything together. It's just confusing enough to addict you into finding the truth, yet clear enough to keep you on the hunt for more. This is the kind of game that you can easily spend hours on without realizing. It just might leave you laying awake at night mulling over what you've experienced. It combines gritty, realistic, post-modern elements with whimsical pieces of myth and mystery, and amongst it all you'll find insight that truly transcends anything in the gaming universe today.\n\nUnlike a lot of current story-based games, you don't feel like a tourist, you actually feel like an adventurer. You feel like you're the one making the discoveries, not being read to on a forced, one-track story. Leviathan is tangible, it's interactive, it feels  real.  The music and ambiance is on an entire different level as well. It really immerses you into the game. The environment you explore actually feels like a living, breathing beast, and it will send shivers down your spine.\n\nIt's an experience unlike anything I've ever known in gaming. Do yourself a favour and buy it.","December 3, 2014","true","3.5"," 88 of 99 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","88","99","2","0"

The player sees the world through his manic eyes, unfolding a narrative concerning themes of uncertainty, love, and, most importantly, the nature of dreams.\n\nGameplay: Nonexistent, but this is a mercy. Any puzzles would disrupt the game's pace; the only challenge exists in finding the notes composing a 30,000 word novella (which I'll get to later), and trust me, you'll want to find every last scrap. The game has a heavy emphasis on exploration, and little inhibits this. My only complaint here is that it is sometimes unclear when a door leads out of an area permanently rather than just to a smaller side room, which occasionally caused places to go unexplored, as I couldn't return.\n\nVisuals: The graphics and art style strike a beautiful middle ground between DIshonored and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, making good use of the Unreal Engine. While textures themselves are slightly muddy, their stylized nature makes the environments easy on the eyes, and the art direction throughout the game, especially in the dream sequences, absolutely breathtaking. From the dank, oppressive atmosphere of the sewers to the melancholy desolation of the surface, there's never a dull sight.\n\nStory: This is the real meat of the game. While the actual story behind the game is murky (a non-issue which will surely be cleared up in the already-announced sequels), the writing is simply on another level. I'm used to toning down my standards for small indie games when it comes to the quality of narrative delivery, but the novella bits in particular are--no joke-- life-changing. The writer/s have a remarkable grasp of incomprehensibly deep philosophical thought to the point where it will almost always feel like they're ahead of you. That is perfectly fine, as the point of the game is to define a new philosophy for yourself, determining the nature of your own reality. The novella pieces are absolutely vital to the narrative, and a couple playthroughs will likely be necessary to track down any missed sections. It's good to go into the game knowing that you need to scour every area as thoroughly as possible before moving on, because you don't want to miss some of the best writing ever put into a game.\n\nSound: This deserves a special little section. The ambient sound is consistently chilling, and I honestly felt scared at points upon hearing the rattle of a can in the wind even though I knew nothing would jump out at me. The music, especially during dreams, is spot-on, adding to the experience without overshadowing it at all. It's also very well-synced to your actions, which is impressive given the number of branching paths in the game world. Finally, there is only one voice-acted character--you, a.k.a. Jonah-- and the talent is very, very good. Far better, in fact, than any indie game has a right to. This guy should be doing voicework for higher-paying games, because honestly, this was one of the most surprising parts of the game. Good narration is hard to do, and this guy nails it. Props.\n\nLength: About a five-hour experience if you really take your time. And please, please /really take your time/.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nThis game is a shockingly in-depth exploration of what it means to be isolated in a world where certainty is fleeting. It's a scathing critique of Dostoevsky's Underground Man (I'm gonna stress this: fans of Dostoevsky are going to love the novellas, because Solomon is essentially Raskolnikov), becoming a quest to find a replacement for certainty. I won't reveal what this replacement is, but suffice to say that the experience is absolutely brilliant and worth every minute you pour into it.\n\n10/10","December 5, 2014","true","3.4"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","46","51","0","2"

No first-semester philosophy teacher would accept this as an essay.\n\nThen there are volumes of references to bible stories posted on every second wall in the sewerage, making their complexity appear so trivial that the player will likely ignore them altogether to not interrupt the walking flow.\n\nIn conclusion, a visually stunning experience utterly destroyed by an absurd narrative which is stubbornly distracting the player from what the title does best.","December 26, 2015","false","1.7"," 90 of 131 people (69%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","69","90","131","10","3"

Finally a story-driven game with an engaging (and beautiful) atmosphere that does not see the need to keep me preoccupied with puzzles or inherently useless gameplay mechanics. The game takes you on a walk through a world where fantasy dances around with reality in delicate coordination. Oh, it was SO refreshing! The Old City: Leviathan  is full to the brim with satisfying contemplative fodder for the daydreaming or philosophical mind. I played through it once but it will require several playthroughs to get a decent grasp of everything it wants to say. I am going to add my opinion here of what the game was trying to say. I don't want to ruin anything for anyone so I will put a spoiler tag on it just in case.   For me the game has mirrored my journey of seeking the absolute truth, my endeavor to find peace of mind and certainty, but in the end finding none of that. I have begged religion and science for the answers to life's mysteries as have the people spoken of in this story.  Unfortunately, the closer you get to a more "objective" truth the more questions you end up with than answers. If any of that journey sounds familiar to you this game may make a lot more sense to you.  Oh, boy here I go..... philosophical tangent.....   Like I said this game is a mirror, maybe there is no objective truth...... can any of us see reality with complete objectivity? Don't we all look at life through some version of rose colored glasses, through some inherent bias? Maybe that is what the game is trying to say.... tangent finished  Anyway, I love this game. I wish there were more just like it. I wish every "walking simulator" were just as engaging in story and in atmosphere. I wish other ones would take out their silly puzzles and just let me explore their ideas and the environment.

As "passive participant walking simulators" go, it's got a lot going for it. It also has some evocative visual twists, as it has you repeat some familiar areas, but changes them subtly (or not subtly).\n\nDefinitely on the side of "wonder/mystery" and less "suspense/horror".\n\nUltimately, though, the story is extremely convoluted. While delivered by a great voice actor, and while it sells itself as having layers of meaning and metaphor... it ultimately doesn't make any sense, and there's no story payoff: The game suddenly ends at a black screen with no resolution and no real sense of what happened, what will happen, and what was happening the entire time you were playing. In the forums, the dev commented that they're thinking of later adding more content that ties things together, adds a payoff.\n\nQuite disappointing, because there was a lot of unique ideas, and there are setting elements of a post-apocalypse background world (hints of "Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of the Moon"), but they never manifest or realize, much less complete, any more than temporary blotches on a confusing campus. Without any grounding, it's all just shifting sands.\n\nPretty sands, mind: Great graphics and sound. But ultimately disappointing. If the devs get back to grounding some story elements as aluded to in forum comments, then it might be worth a revisit.\n\nAlso: Wonky controller support (even setting buttons for Zoom, Run on an XBox controller does nothing); limited key assignment functionality (could not assign run button to Right Shift, only Left; and NONE of the mouse buttons other than Mouse 1 are assignable, what?); and finally walking is Extremely Slow, and running is Slightly Less than Extremely Slow.

The primary feelings here are isolation and dread punctuated by moments of disgust.\n\nCons:\n- No gameplay except walking around and exploring.\n- Walking around and exploring is occasionally frustrating as you may accidentally leave an area before exploring it completely. You can double-back and going through an area is simple once you know where you're going, but doing so breaks the flow of the game. Probably a side-effect of not being completely linear.\n\nPros:\n+ Looks beautiful. Runs on Unreal Engine.\n+ Sounds amazing. Music is dark ambient composed by Atrium Carceri.\n+ Story is decent. I was debating putting this in a third category that is neither a pro nor a con because the narration is occasionally confusing and the prose is very long while saying very little, but ultimately I decided this works with the rest of the feel of the game. Nothing groundbreaking here either, but it fits.\n\nVerdict:\nRecommended because The Old City: Leviathan knows what it is and executes it well.\n\nCaveat:\nThe Old City: Leviathan Is not for everyone.

The GRAPHICS are amazing and there's alot of instances where you'll simply stop walking just to fully enjoy the scenery. The MUSIC is subtle and that works great for this type of game--a soft eerie melody that keeps you wondering what might happen when you enter the next room. The CONTROLS aren't much to speak of, obviously, as you'll only use the 'Use" key to open doors and collect a handful of (quite lengthy) notes.\n\nThe reason that I've chosen to not recommend this lays in the story and overall (attempted) philosophy of the game. You will find yourself putting together a background for why you are where you are and even who you may have been before the events of the game and none of it will matter because there doesn't seem to be any reason. The game takes a simple philosophy and stretches it until it borders on mindless drivel and can even be considered quite arrogant. There are several instances where some of the dialogue sounds quite deep and enlightening before you realize it makes absoloutely no sense. It may simply be that you are supposed to apply the verses being preached to your own assumptions, therefore creating your own story, but with such little meaning to any of it there's no real reason to even attempt to piece it together. You may as well just mute the sound, turn off subtitles and just let your imagination create a "mod" in place of whatever is supposed to be happening.\nLike I said before though, there are several instances where you will see things that you are almost certain are part of some inner turmoil and hints that there may be something sinister happening behind the curtains but if this is indeed true, they don't let you in on it.

I purchased this off of a Steam Sale because I was a little skeptical (which I would recommend because this game is not for everyone). It is short game, but should be given time for full immersion and discovery (for me, it took 11 hours). There is no objective but to explore and discover as you please. While it is not totally free roam and directed towards a singular path, there are areas that are easy to miss if you are not careful. Even some subtle but interesting and sometimes amazing details. The environment has moments of beauty and moments of creepiness thanks to the amazing visuals and perfectly timed ambient. The true value I found in this game is the story. There are a lot of philosophical elements and analogies that are very interesting. As you read through a variety of notes and explore new areas, you learn more things about the world around you and follow the intriguing stories of a few specific characters.

Even though the symbols used are quite original in thought, they suffer the same problem all western-born symbolism shares - there is too much religious undertone that holds the entire structure. However, here it's at least done properly. The symbols expand from one to several meanings and ultimately - grant truth in thought.\nVery few gripes can be had here otherwise. Overmapped surfaces sometimes cause you to bump into rocks or edges, slowing you down. And it's a bit tiresome to stop and read all the text scattered across the landscape. All pages that can be found are well written and interesting, revealing quite a lot about the miracle world you walk in, but stoping to read causes the player to stop exploring, which is the biggest drive in intriguing place like the Old City. It's sad that they were not voiced, so the player could listen to them while exploring (simillar to Voxophones in BioShock, etc).\nBeyond that, "The Old City: Leviathan" is the most thought-provoking and meaningful "gaming" experience I've ever had. It's the closest thing to art I've felt since "Journey" and it's a shame it's so underground. This also speaks a lot about our society, for if this had been a book or a short story, even a movie, it would have gotten huge praise. But that's a talk for another time.\nThose who crave something meaningful and beautiful, which will leave them sinking in thought - Leviathan calls for you, so fall and be brave. To everyone else, who thinks that philosophical artpieces are not their thing - you are probably right, but still keep in mind that the game is very beautiful - there is loads to see in this world. And even if you deny the symbolism, the pure story told is very intriguing, as the world built seems surprisingly believable.\n"The Old City: Leviathan" is one of the best experiences available in the market. If you think you are going to enjoy this, you mos tcertainly are (for one reason or another). Spread the word, get more people to feel this, as it is a masterpiece worthy of something much more than a GOTY.","December 29, 2015","true","2.3"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","0"

It took less than 3 hours to complete, and I'd say I explored probably 60% of the game. Certain areas I know I missed but wasnt able to go back to check them out. The areas reveal the protagonists philosophic musings, and also allow you to find pages of books and such that give you a better grasp for what is going on in the game. That said, I am fairly certain everybody who plays this will absolutely be a bit confused and will draw wildly variant ideas about what this game really means. To me, that is the beauy of a game like this: it allows you to draw your own conclusions, revise them, revise them again, and so on, ad nauseum.\n\nThe gameplay itself is simple. walk around, occasionally interact with an object (and that really is just doors and the memory cubes you might find that unlock Solomans story), jump (which I only found one reason to use through the whole game, run (which I basically used the whole game), and zoom.\n\nThe graphics are pretty stunning. They made very good use of this to impact the story and provide a reason to keep moving forward.\n\nSo, as I said above, the story is wildly confusing and vague. First you have to decide if it is all a hallucination, a dream, reality, or a fusion of those things. Dunno. However, to keep it simple, lets say it is irrelevant. The world was destroyed and the remnants of mankind fled underground. They were able to tap into a water source and surtvive. However they also split into three philosophical/religious factions that were constantly at odds with each other. A fourth faction made up of neutral loners sort of held the peace by being the intermediaries between factions. This obviously failed as it seems everybody killed each other and you, a surviving mionotaur, are left to explore the world, your own sanity, and try to make some sort of sense out of your existence. Basically. Lol\n\nWorth trying out, althoguh I dont think I would pay full price for it necessarily (and didnt in point of fact). There is certainly potential for no less than two playthroughs, so it has added value there. I did think the monologue was a bit pretentious and I got tired of listening to the protagonist wax poetic. I also got a little bored with some of the gameplay as well. That said, it was still a fairly engaging experience.\n\nOverall, I would give this a 7 out of 10, but YMMV.","February 14, 2015","true","2.6"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

It's a walking simulator with a ton of writing, some of it may come off as pretentious, but I actually really liked the world, characters, and story to the game, so it worked for me. It succeeds at what it sets out to do since, while the gameplay is little more than walking around, the locations are interesting, sometimes breathtaking, and other times creepy. Each area has a hidden event you can uncover (or not) that usually puts a grim dark, sometimes horror-esque, twist on the location, and helps run with the games themes if we're crazy or 'see beyond the void.' The writing is optional, but also not if you really want to get the most out of the game. It is long-winded, and you'll spend a lot of time reading if you get into it, but I found myself engaged by it most of the time and liked the way the story was told, and how the writing would be reflected, sometimes much later, in the game world itself, leading to a feeling of it all being connected.\n\nThe characters are well-realized and flawed despite there not being a single cutscene in the game and you never meet another character in person (just read things from them or about them, our character speaks of them, and we see places where they once were or lived in). The music is well-done and fits when it creeps up. The before-mentioned events and effects of those events you can find are well done. And the game has a level of subtlety to many of its themes and small changes.\n\nBasically, for what the game sets out to do, I think it succeeds, and I quite enjoyed it. But what it sets out to do I don't think would be universally appealing, and really I'd only recommend it to those that like walking simulators and exploring, cryptic psychological stories, and don't mind reading a lot. A worth-while walking simulator for the mind that doesn't mind some reading, thinking, and and visual-audio stimuli to keep oneself invested.","October 30, 2015","true","5.9"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","2"

But that could not be further from the truth. The story of a man trying to find Truth in his exploration of the remnants of a world long gone, The Old City: Leviathan is a hell of an experience.\n\nIf you don't like to read, I would have to suggest this game is not for you. I would recommend turning subtitles on and then just exploring the world. Read the pages scattered around the world, pick up Solomon's journals and follow his progression (digression?) across the course of his words and just feel the story.\n\nThe visuals, sound and all around atmosphere are completely absorbing. Though there's no enemies, no other living entities you encounter apart from some mythical beasts that form more set than interactive partner, at moments there was real tension, a terror of the unknown and what you may find next.\n\nThis story does not hold your hand. You have to piece it together as you progress, between your character's musings, the journals and scattered books and pages you find. It won't explain what The Fall is, it won't go into the reasons why the world is how it is... It just Is.\n\nBut if you are willing to let go, to engage in the story... it will take you all the way down and engulf you in its depths.

If you think the words the narrator uses is to complicated and if you think the narrator misuses the words then yea, it's not the games fault, I think it's you specifically that the words are to complicated for, I think it's YOU that don't understand them. Because he doesn't misuse any words, and words are certainly not hard to understand if you understand basic English.\nThe narrator in the game was very nice to listen to and only helped with the already weird philosophical story, plot and setting of the game.\n\nI will not spoil anything but the atmosphere in the game and the story take many weird, or more correctly dark and gory turns. Find out for yourself but I liked it.\n\nThe game itself, the graphics are very beautiful to look at, which is almost always the case with the Unreal Engine. The music is amazing, and the game is exactly what you're told it is, it's an exploration walking simulator with little to no actually content/gameplay, this game is obviously marketed to already-fans of walking simulators, so don't buy this if you don't know what you're getting into.\nIf you don't like reading I don't recommend it either, there is a lot of reading as I said if you want to follow the plot, which I recommend that you do. But you don't have to read, if you just want to explore in a very beautiful game while listening to a nice voice actor then there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nThe game is a philosophical art piece, so if you enjoy philosophy then get in, and if you enjoy art in the form of games.\nI enjoyed it very much due to that, it got me thinking. I very often say that Walking Simulators aren't always bad due to the lack of content, they can be great in the way of how they can make you think about things you never thought about.\nI don't care if you refuse to call walking simulators games, I don't care if you'd like to call them a "First Person Art Piece Exhibit" or whatever you want to call it, it's a nice game for what it's quite obviously marketed as.\n\n\nA must buy for any walking simulator fan, for any person who loves philosophy, and for any person who loves art in the form of games, and I recommend it as a new experience to anyone who haven't played a game like this before.\n\nA must buy in my opinion.","April 8","true","3.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Every note is worth reading, and those that need to be collected in each chapter are easy enough to find - once you realize you have to interact with things that give no indication of being clickable.\n\nRather existential in its monologue-riddled storyline, sometimes this crosses the border from intriguing speech to psuedo philosophy.

This gets better deeper into the game, almost as if the developers are improving as you go.\n\nWith an enchanting atmosphere, a few well-placed unsettling moments, and a foundation built on biblical reference, this game ultimately offers a great 5 hour experience.

At no stage did I have a decent grasp of what was happening. The narrator is always spouting some vaguely mystic cerebral heady statements about truth and dreams. I had no idea if I was inside the mind of the main character or if I was exploring an actual city that this character inhabited. I additionally was unclear as to whether that distinction even mattered to begin with. I began to ask myself if the confusion was intentional. I decided that even if it was I was not having a decent experience regardless. It is shame that this 'narratively focused experiment' main take away is confusion about reality. At the end the character seemed to find some solace but I had no exposition as to why this was occurring and full disclosure I only read a few of the notes.

It wants you explore its world and piece together its mystery but it insists on locking that mystery behind a door of over-egged philosophy that is so purple in prose it borders on being utterly cringe-worthy. It wants you to identify with its lone survivor, a lethargic mysterious man who inhabits a post apocalyptic world that has been turned upside down - but instead of the player inhibiting the protagonist (it does takes place in first person after all) so that one can make the adventure his/her own, it insists on locking the player out thanks to the main characters continuous mistake of thinking verbosity equals profundity. Yes - I too can wax philosophical about almost anything but that doesn't mean that it's going to be worthwhile and interesting to listen to. In the case of The Old City: Leviathan, for our main unnamed underground man, that proves to be very much the case. He mostly just talks a lot of unedited ♥♥♥♥!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=392557983\nWith musings such as "If only truth did not need to be compatible with itself" you will get these kind of clunkers and many more the further you progress that get more obtuse and overwritten to the point of nausea. In the real world I would call the main protagonist a "narcissist prig" since the man clearly loves the sound of his own wordy cleverness to the point where I was tempted to dial down the audio to zero just so that I wouldn't have to listen to his broken ramblings anymore that try to come across as intelligent and well written but only succeed in being confusing, messy and pretentious. The game does warn the player you are about to enter a broken mind but hell pass me the shotgun so that I can just put this poor soul out of his misery. Or better yet just hand me the shotgun so I can put myself out of this misery.\n\nWith a story so vague to the point of almost alienating its audience, I am not entirely sure who this game is aimed at. While the game follows a similar pattern to past successes (Dear Esther, The Stanley Parable, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, Ether One) those success outstrip The Old City: Leviathan by 10/1. Most of it is going to fly over the head of many who play it anyway and those that enjoy the written word are going to choke on its grandstanding. It also contains lengthy notes of exposition (over 30 000 words we are told if we are to believe the developers) that might have been enjoyable to read if they were not so nonsensical, bordering on being garage phillosophy garbage. Talk about using the Wordsworth dictionary to hit your players over the head with. I give you:-\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=392202964\n"Macro perspectives tend to be accurate by the nature of being distant, and isolation provides a wellspring of distance. After all how can one be nearsighted when their is nothing near to see? Bias always exists  of course, but when one is alone, the bias only presents a conflict of interaction, not scope. That is to say, the bias of an isolated individual is an internal issue that follows the same rules on insecurity and selfishness that a more involved social bias does without the lack of context created by blinders"\n\nYAWN! And YES the game is filled to the brim with this kind of terribly elaborate text.\n\nThe game also tries to pit its philosophy against the backdrop of certain biblical references such as the drinking of the unclean water clearly a nod to Adam and Eve being cast from the garden after eating the apple, but in this instance being driven mad by visions on consumption and being cast into the void. Jonah and the whale also makes an appearance as do Abraham (you are asked to take quite a few leaps of faith as the story progresses much like Abraham was asked to have faith in God when God commanded that he sacrafice his own son in his name) and Solomon (where Solomon tried to split the baby here we have each tribe being split into the believers and "scientists" and those poor lost souls who don't buy into any of this religious/scientific mumbo-jumbo stuck somewhere in in the middle). While trying to be a tower of Babel of sorts with regards to its philosophical and religious agendas it ends up more like the leaning tower of Pisa. The ending is pretty much left open to the interpretation of the player. Is religion the gilded cage that keeps us stagnating or is it the key which frees us from our worldly confines? Can there ever be such a thing as a Utopia? That is up to you to decide.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=392201166\nGraphically The Old City: Leviathan is an interesting world to explore. Built using the trusty Unreal Engine it will be instantly recognizable to any player who has enjoyed a game built on this engine before (the downside being that it resembles almost every other Unreal Engine 3 game released) and can often be fun to explore if it were not bogged down by the weight of its own clunky narrative and hopelessy prissy and annoying protagonist.\n\nI tried to enjoy The Old City: Leviathan but within a few minutes of booting up the game it was already trying my patience to breaking point. I realize what you pull out of this experience will be your own and this is just my ramblings - you could very well end up enjoying listening to its dime store philosophy wrapped up as "look at me and my impressive prose" and piecing together its mystery - so please don't take my word as gospel - but as a person who often enjoys these quiet, meditative adventures I found The Old City: Leviathan to be a void of nothingness that ultimately tries to be too clever for its own good and  ends up failing on almost all accounts. When it comes to The Old City: Leviathan I  would rather just consume the unclean water from the onset and be cast into the void immediately than to have to experience this kind of wordy introspection!\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","February 14, 2015","false","2.6"," 66 of 121 people (55%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","55","66","121","7","16"

The developers boast that there are over 30,000 words of text in the game.\n\nThis wouldn't necessarily be a downside, but most of the text is the shallow philosophical ramblings of the narrator, and the rest is overly-long and flowery exposition about the philosophies of three warring post-apocalyptic factions. None of the text is engaging, and none of it has any pertinence to what the player is doing, or contributes anything to the setting.\n\nIgnoring the uninteresting and unrelated narrative, Leviathan is a beautiful but empty experience, like wandering through an action game in a developer mode with all of the monster spawns and puzzles turned off. There are numerous areas throughout the game that are clearly designed to be combat arenas, boss fights, and ammo caches, but are all strangely empty. I would love some day to play the HL2 clone and the Dark Souls clone that the developers clearly started out trying to make, but I can't really recommend this.","January 17","false","2.7"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

If you like action packed games or clear, strutctured linear stories (because those are fun too, right?), then you might want to think about buying this game.\n\nIf you have a pretty open mind, like narrative driven stories that make you really think and you enjoy immersing yourself in an environment, then this is a great game for you! The Old City: Leviathan is a narrative-driven game which some have deemed a 'walking simulator' which I feel is rather unfair. It's a unique game, to be sure.\n\nThe Old City Leviathan is, first off, a beautifully crafted game. Very few games, even AAA titles today, can really pull off the amazing sense of atomsphere and environment. As you, the player, walk around this world of the Old City, it carries a strange air of eerie beauty. Even the sewers you find yourself in have a charm to them, having been turned into tempoary abodes by the sparse population. Perhaps its beauty lies in the sense of decay and the lonliness of the character as he explores an empty shell.\nNow and then, you alternate from 'reality' to dream although it's difficult to tell sometimes. You may find, as I have, that re-visiting areas yield changes, some marginal, some noticeable.\n\nThere are no puzzles, no traps and no enemies in this world and this is very deliberate. Your role is not to fight, but to explore, to immerse yourself in this strange and exotic world.\n\nThe in-game story is a little vague at times, partly due to the mode of storytelling which is told through monologues and pages. As you explore and read the notes left for you, things become a little clearer. The monologues and many of the notes are generally philsophical in many ways although you do receive some backstory into the main characters.\n\nThe theories esposued are not altogether clear or easy to understand, but as I mentioned above (and as the developer explainned) this isn't a game for everyone. The theories are interesting though and as you learn more, you might form your own theories. The main one, or rather, the one I latched onto, was seeing the game in a biblical sense but there are probably many theories in this game.\n\nThis is a game that is very different from many other games. I might go so far as to call it a 'therapy game' because I found exploring the Old City and the dream worlds quite relaxing. It is a beautiful, detailed and thought-provoking story-driven game and I hope big game developers are taking notes on this.\nI am certainly looking forward to more from this developer.

The whole game is around 2-3 hours long.\n\nThe Old City: Leviathan is a short, surreal first person exploration game with a focus on story, one of those 'walking simulators' I guess, which personally I do enjoy that type of game, or now you could say genre. Before we go on, yes this is a game, and a good one too.\n\nThe game is very much of an experience to have, while every game is an 'experience to have', it's the focus in this game, where you explore and wander in its world, listening to a story and trying to figure it out, throwing at you the experience and vision of it's creator, and while every game does that to a certain degree, this game is a full dose of it.\n\nIt started off very creep and scary, to the point where I thought i should stop playing, but I took a little break, dismissed the idea that it's scary and embarrassed that it's a weird and unique experience, and so my uneasy feeling went away. What came after that is the awesome, beautiful look of the game, with cozy colorful graphic style and pretty effects, nicely designed levels with amazing models and structures, followed by a fitting soundtrack to keep the interest going, and nice narration.\n\nAlthough I didn't understand the gist of the story, or even most of it, like half of the games on this genre, it felt good i guess, and nice to get something out of it too from time to time. Also there's a lot (not MMORPG a lot) of text to read every now and then in-game on a piece of paper of book, which are kind of nice.\n\nThere isn't much to say, the game is good and I like it because of it's awesome looks, design, relaxation, and narration with a few story bits. It has a lot of elements of Dear Esther in terms of its approach, a bit of The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter with its mystery, and a tiny bit of The Stanley Parable with its design. Also, for some reason the game made it so that every door you open, you open a whole new world, and so every time I want to open one, I get extremely excited and anxious, and satisfied with the results most of the time. If you like the genre then you will like this game.\n\nShameless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.","February 11, 2015","true","7.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","8","11","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zipje_en_zopje/recommended/297350/","zipje_en_zopje","Syrrah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zipje_en_zopje/","1553 products in account","*************************************************************\nDISCLAIMER: I'm in a particularly foul mood today.\nDo not read this review if you are easily offended.\n*************************************************************\n\nOnce in a while I like to play a walking simulator: relaxingly walking around in a fantastic world, exploring and being fed a story. The Old City Leviathan (a.k.a. TOCL) is such a game ... and I have a hard time recommending it, even though it pains me to admit.\n\nFirst, realize very well that this is truly a walking simulator. You will not shoot things. There are no puzzles. There is basically no interaction with the game world. You walk. You discover the story. That's it. If this is not something you can live with, please do yourself a favor and steer far away from this game.\n\nI repeat: THIS IS  A WALKING SIMULATOR. DO NOT BUY IF YOU DON'T LIKE WALKING SIMULATORS OR IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A WALKING SIMULATOR IS. Pardon me for shouting b.t.w.\n\nThere, now that 99% of the readers have left, we can actually start with the review.\n\nTOCL casts you in a bizarre, dream-like environment consisting of sewers, palaces and underwater cities amongst others. Exploring the strange world around you, your aim is to walk to the end and figure out the meaning of everything you saw and heard meanwhile.\n\nThis is a major point of difference from other walking simulators, which focus on telling a story. There is no story in TOCL: a story has a beginning, a middle and an end. This game basically has neither of those three. Or to put it in another way: it has no beginning while the middle and end are the same. Does that sound confusing to you? Welcome to TOCL, your journey is only just beginning.\n\nInstead of a story, we are fed with pseudo-psychological rants & contemplations and journal pieces which more often than not refer to Jewish mythology. And that is where the game's ugly head reveals itself.\n\nFirst of all, the psychological rants come in the form of fully voiced-over and subtitled monologues. These are unfortunately immature and just ... well ... uninteresting. It is the type of pseudo-psychology that a college or university student might find interesting, just because it is so "far out there" or "it makes so much sense (in a sheltered environment)". But in reality it all is laughable, cliche and predictable. And boring, oh God it is so utterly, mindbogglingly boring. For the first time in my life I have actually screamed at my screen: before I knew it, I yelled "not again ... just shut the fuch up" when yet another endless soliloquy began in this game.\n\nSecond, all through the game world are paper sheets attached to the walls, completely filled with text (and occasionally text in other forms as well). Hidden in every chapter are also "Solomon's Notes", which give even more insight in what happened to the world. It is necessary to read all of that text to get a full understanding. But there is just so much of it ... stopping in nearly every room to read up did get on my nerves at times. A walking simulator is about walking, not about standing still!\n\nTo add insult to injury, the writing itself is just not good. If the developer ever makes a part 2, then I strongly suggest to hire a professional writer for such a text-heavy game. The writing now is incoherent and never invites you to continue reading; it never pulls you into the game, which is a real shame because the graphics do allow solid immersion.\n\nAll the writing is also overly pompous. Using a variety of words to add colour to your text is good. Using dif-fi-cult and va-ri-ous words just for the same of using difficult and various words, being overly wordy just for the sake of being overly wordy, is pretentious. Lots of highfalutin language here folks. See, I can do it too! Oops, that should read: I say thee, look, for ye shall see that this mortal has the ingenuity to mock thee by mimicking thine very own grandiloquent style, nay, the nature of thine very self. Oh woe upon thee, for thou dreams shall be shattered when reality dawns upon thee - the reality that the tales ye spinneth in ye work of entertainment are not exceptional and that the narrative of said work has the same attraction a dead crab has on a whale. Forsooth!\n\nFinally, to understand what is happening, just must have some understanding of Jewish mythology. The story of Jonah forms a major plot-point, the figures of Leviathan and Ziz are frequently referred to and there are several clever references all through the game (see the above screenshot with "Sheol" for example).\n\nWithout such background it will be difficult to understand some elements or you will even be mislead. So can the figure of Leviathan be confusing based on your background, as it was originally a sea-creature that tried to kill Jonah's whale while the game seems to imply that you are Jonah (sort of) and swallowed by a methaphoric Leviathan. "Leviathan" in Christian mythology, even though also based on the Old Testimant, refers to Satan for example, which would give an entirely different meaning to the pieces of literature you find. I have no idea how the Islamic interpretation of the story of Jonah goes (it probably ends with the whale being blown up -> this is satire, relax people), but I can imagine that a gamer with an Islamic background will give yet another completely diferent interpretation to TOCL's story.\n\nAll in all, the weak and pompous writing, boring and uninteresting attempts at psychological monologues and reliance on elements not in the game drag down the quality of TOCL by a lot.\n\nWhat remains are the technical aspects, which are great: the world is incredibly beautiful and leads us from one stunning vista to the next. Just look at the screen shots above! That is what you will get in game as well.\n\nOne disappointing fact about the graphics are the lack of movement: except for a very few exceptions, almost everything is static. If you brush against leaves of a plant, those leaves will not move for example. There is basically zero interaction between yourself and the environment. But maybe that is the intention and I was just too stupid to catch the metaphor (something about you being only a dream in a real environment - now that is a plot twist!)\n\nThe sound and music are nice. Not outstanding but nice. There are not a lot of sound effects but you are mostly treated to ambient background noise and fragments of music, which suit the game well and add to the creepy and disturbing atmosphere.\n\nFinally the game really awards exploration by hiding the above-mentioned Solomon's Notes in far-off places. Unfortunately it is not always clear what is the exit to the next chapter and what is a side-passage, which easily results in you missing out on a Note. Imagine this: you are in a room with 2 identical doors: picking the right one ends the chapter, forcing you to restart the entire game (!) if you wanted to find the Solomon's Note hidden far beyond the left door. For such a game where reading everything is mandatory, that is just not good development.\n\nAll in all I do not recommend TOCL unless you have a fetish for Jewish mythology, you crave some "baby's first psychology lesson" or are just a graphics [edited:] "lady of the street" who wants to walk through some gorgeous set-pieces and otherwise ignore the writer's musings completely. I kinda enjoyed this game but only because I am such a graphics [edited:] "lady of the street" and have a good knowledge of middle-eastern mythologies, yet If I had spent more than 3$ I would have feel scammed.","March 30","false","1.3"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","14","23","2","6"

I finished it yesterday. This game is so beautiful it reminds me of how, 'Vanishing Of Ethan Carter', was So visually stunning.\nThis a 'solo walkthough'-type of game with moody insights vocalizing though-out game play.

Game is worth it in the end for a cheap price. I would give it a neutral review but there is thumbs up and down so i'll favor thumbs down to balance the average.\n\n\nThe game is gorgeous and there are some spots, jawdrops. I did not like the monologues from the narrator, and I did not like a lot how the game develops. The character moves at an exagerate slow pace. This means that most of the time, when you noticed there were 2 or 3 ways you could explore, you'll be too lazy going back something you have already seen. Even if you sprint, it will take long.\n\nThe game doesn't prompt you to the next chapter, this also means that maybe you are unlucky, you find the door that leads to the next chapter, and you can't go back (unless you reload the chapter and play again). These are details, but show how something very easy to fix, was a bit ignored.\n\nI loved games like Gone Home and Ether One (Dear Esther too but less than the other two), I didn't find this game as good. It gives so many abstract elements and no clear end to them, it doesn't even leave space for an interpretation.\n\nThere are TONS of things to read, with a kind of language that I find forced, rather than 'poetic'.

That's because this is one of those "you either love it or hate it" games.  And I say game lightly.  The Old City is more of a story than a game that has 11 chapters.  In my opinion it's more like a dream simulator.  Think of, Dear Esther and The Stanley Parable had a lovechild.  Like Dear Esther it's short and a walkthrough story.  Like The Stanley Parable because some things aren't what they appear and the character is narrated.  Some rooms seem to repeat and other times a wall is now a door way.  The Old City is both beautiful and eerie.  It used the Unreal engine and the graphics are real nice.  If you want to play something casual and short and don't want to worry about mind-bending gameplay give The Old City a try.\n\nPros:\n- Great for something short and casual.\n- Both beautiful and eerie environments.\n- Feels like a post-apocalyptic dream.\n- Lots to explore.\n- Neat way of looking at Unreal Engine visuals.\n\nCons:\n- Even though it's a story game the storyline isn't very solid.\n- Leaves you asking a lot of questions\n- You don't know if you're going the right direction but most of the time it doesn't seem to matter.","June 12, 2015","true","1.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I would more than highly recomend.\nHonestly, I would like this to be adapted for mobile device tablet, for Ipad, and Kindle Fire.\nI would love to play this anytime out when I'm either bored, or waiting or something.\nI only hope someday it might be adapted.","January 11","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It seemed so over the top - but as the game progressed that became less of an issue for me and I started gathering better what was going on with the story.  The world is what is left from a literal war between ideologies/philosophies - and the narrative is one man's story of trying to make sense of it all.\n\nThe visuals, world building, and attention to detail are truly "stunning".  There is so much care put into designing the world.  So many little details.  I took alot of photos (f12) while playing.  There's not much you can interact with, but if you like exploring, this feels like a place that was lived in.\n\nUnderstand that this is very much a world that you travel through - not a world that you interact with in any meaningful way beyond opening doors.  At first I was frustrated by this, but once I understood how the game worked, I was OK with it.  It's not like Gone Home or similar where you pick up items to learn about the story.  In The Old City you are an observer - a passer through.  The story is told by what you see, short snippets of spoken narrative, and by the notes you find on the wall.\n\nAnyhow, in total I feel like this game had a considerable amount of heart and care put into it - and despite any shortcomings is well worth a playthrough if you like walking simulator type games.","January 31","true","5.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So far, however, I'm hooked on the storyline. It's hard to give a comprehensive review without giving spoilers, so I'll take a Lovecraft approach and say it's impossible to describe.\n\nWhat you should know is that this game is primarily a walking journey with narrative. There are some unlockable notes that you can find throughout the game, so that gives it a little bit of challenge; the word 'challenge' here is used lightly, however, as more in-depth exploration of each chapter will ultimately lead you to each note.  While exploring you learn about the main character as well as your own role in said character's story.\n\nPositives so far:\n\n1) The plot is intriguing. It has enough depth that makes you want to keep walking around and discover the details of each chapter's story.\n\n2) The narratives are voiced by a gentleman that is pleasant on the ears. This is especially good since some of the monologues are a bit lengthy.\n\n3) The scenery is nicely imagined and you will encounter some things that will make you wonder if you took a hit of acid or ate some shrooms before you started playing.\n\nCritique so far:\n\n1) If you turn on subtitles the lengthier monologues are lumped into one paragraph, taking up about the bottom fourth to third of your screen. The developer should have broken it down into two smaller chunks so as not to detract from the scenery while you continue to walk.\n\n2) It's a little wonky to interact with some of the doors. If you're not standing at just the right spot, it may take some maneuvering to get them to close.\n\n3) I wish the run function was just a wee bit faster.\n\n4) It is possible that you may go through a door or other passage and accidentally finish a chapter before you fully explored it. A bit of a bummer with continuity, but it's the chance you take with a not completely linear game. Fortunately the game offers chapter select and you can go back to explore things you might have missed.\n\nOverall this is still a great game and you will think so too if you enjoy a casually-paced mystery that keeps you guessing.","April 16","true","10.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The naration is done by an insane individual whom you cannot wholly trust. The narrative is about deep philosophical themes as the actions of Jonah and the rest of the world are discussed between Jonah and Leviathan. You cannot trust Jonah's sight or mind, but you are carried by his words and reasoning. You are left piecing together the end of mankind through the notes plastered on the walls, the various markings of other people, and the scattered journals/notes of Solomon. You read about the life, philosophy and pessimism of Solomon through these lengthy notes you collect, and while slow at first, they piece together the broken world you now inhabit. Solomon's movements are occasionally noticeable via clues in the environment, as well as the other Minotaurs that were once used to create peaceful discussion between the three factions (Guild, Unknowing and Order).\n\nJonah does not just dream, but creates engaging discourse and reasoning from his dreams. He uses them to pursue a potentially unknowable truth when he cannot necessarily trust the foundations from which he reasons. With him, you adventure with uncertainty as you witness the demise of those with certainty, and all in all, it makes for an engaging experience, though I'm not sure I could call it fun. I simply wish the beauty could have lasted longer, which could have happened if the dream sequences held bigger areas. They certainly beat the sewers.\n\nThere is little to no interactivity in this world besides opening/closing doors and collecting Solomon's notes. It is not always clear where the exit to a level is. Sometimes it is close to the beginning, other times it is the last thing you will find. But through most of my playthrough, I had a pretty good idea of where the final door was, and then went back to explore whatever I had missed, triggering as much of the dialog as possible. Most of the chapters go through a rinse and repeat cycle of exploring half the level, entering a dream sequence, then exploring the rest with the level being altered in some way, encouraging backtracking. But unfortunately, movement is very slow. While it forces you to take in the atmosphere, backtracking or going back to that one room you skipped is a pain, though the levels are small enough that it is still worth the effort. There is a run button, but it is only marginally better than walking. There is jumping, but it is almost never necessary as there is no platforming. It is an engaging walking simulater, and the best one I have played so far. I am left desiring to enter the Old City, and cannot wait for the next game to come out.","December 5, 2014","true","15.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If a passive traversal of a foreign world, steeped in an obscure mythology, appeals to you, then by all means have at it (the game plays in 2-3 hours).  The atmosphere is rich and often chilling, and you're left to piece together the story as you progress.\n\nThat said, I found the sheer density of the game's philosophical musings to be indulgent and off-putting. Some of the earliest written notes are so rambling that they ask much of the gamer's patience. And while the protagonist's monologues are intriguing, they're so laden with half-baked philosophy that I frequently halted my exploration just to make sense of what he was saying. The written language is likewise burdened with unwieldy phrases like "he experienced didactic emptiness." This all seems deliberate, as the language agrees with the characterization. You just have to decide whether you want to explore both a mysterious world and philosophical notions of idealism/realism. It often seems the game is more interested in the latter (which unfortunately isn't its greatest strength).\n\nAll that said, the game is still intriguing and atmospheric, and there's enough here to enjoy (and struggle with) to make the effort worthwhile for the right audience.","February 7, 2015","true","4.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The problem is that the games greatest strength is also it's greatest weakness: the writing.\n\nThe Old City: Leviathan is as much a game as it is a book. There's a lot of text here. Solomon's Notes tend to have a rather circular nature, with the occasional horrible tendency to have a lot written to say very little. While true that one could chalk up the writing style as a character quirk, it doesn't make reading the notes any less arduous of a task, at times.\n\nSpeaking of horrible character quirks, let's speak of Jonah, the character you play as and the one that narrates the game: while what he has to say tends to be interesting, and far less circular than Solomon, it's not uncommon for Jonah to say things in a cryptic manner. I occasionally felt as though what he said was a code to be deciphered rather than just a straightforward thought. WIth Jonah, I felt I spent as much time trying to understand what was said as I did understanding the implications of what was said.\n\nThis game is nigh-on unapproachable for most. It might lure you in with pretty scenery, but underneath it all is a narrative that seems to almost be actively opposing your efforts to understand it. It does not want to make your journey easy. Perhaps that was intentional. Perhaps all of the negative points I've listed above are artistic choices, and not necessarily flaws.\n\nStill reading? Good, you might just be a part of the target audience. There's something to this game. Of course, the visuals are solid and the soundtrack is superb, but the writing really is the star of the show here. For all its flaws, the writing is nevertheless interesting. The island and its inhabitants have a strong sense of identity, of realness, which contrasts fantastically with some of the surreal elements of Jonah's fragmented sanity. I wanted to know what happened. By the end, I wanted to know what was in the old city.\n\nBut I don't know what was in the old city. Perhaps that's for the best.

I am a HUGE fan of other walking simulators like Dear Esther, and I have spent dozens upon dozens of hours trying to from a unified theory of what that game was about, but I am completely lost about The Old City, and I have no idea where to start.\n\nThe story hits tons of biblical references, such as Jonah and the whale, Solomon, and various others, but I don't have the slightest clue as to what the meaning of it all is. It's strange, and metaphorical to the bone, but where I felt like Dear Esther's meaning was just beyond my grasp, I haven't the slightest clue what The Old City was trying to convey.\n\nIt could be that the game was just simply not meant for me, but I found the story to be completely nonsensical, and really meaningless. Essentially, it felt like an 8th grader writing a story that is trying to sound deep, but really is utterly beyond comprehension. Being hard to understand is not a sin as long as there is something meaningful there for those that dig. If, however, there is nothing deeper, and the plot is just incomprehensible, then that is a major failing.\n\nI really wanted there to be something more to The Old City, but either I completely missed it, or it is not there. There was a rich backstory, talking about 3 different factions of humans, but nothing was resolved in any satisfactory way. Were the different factions real? Is the story about humanity after a post-apocalyptic fall? Was everything an allegory? Was the Leviathan a metaphor for the world, or was everything happening on a micro-scale within a human body? I couldn't answer any one of those questions, and where I had a solid idea of what Dear Esther meant, I was left with nothing but questions when The Old City's credits rolled, and no desire to find the answers.\n\nAs I mentioned before, being hard to understand is not a sin. Being completely beyond comprehension is.\n\nI have no idea who this game is for, realistically. I was raised with a strong belief in the bible, and while I'm not a staunch believer in it now, I have read both testaments in their entirety at least 5 times. I am extremely familiar with the stories of Jonah and Solomon, but I can't make sense of this game's plot. It's as if someone just used those well-known names as an excuse for "this story is deep".\n\nOn the plus side, the game world is FANTASTICALLY designed, and I was awe-struck on a regular basis as I trudged through the world. It is at times beautiful, at times peaceful and calm, and at other times disturbing and unsettling. I was never completely comfortable, and I never knew what was coming around the bend. Perhaps that was the point of it all, but as mentioned before, I have no idea what the main point of the game was, so I couldn't tell you.\n\nWhat I can say is that if you are looking for a deep, hard-to-understand game with a fantastically-designed world, you should check this one out.

The 'story' is very confusing and the game does not really help you to unravel the mystery of..whatever the mystery is? The narrator is confusing and nothing really makes sense. The best I could gather is this. Spoiler (I guess?) Warning:\n\nYou are a guy who lives in isloation in a sewer of a city. My guess is you used to be trapped in a whale. Or maybe you dreamt the whole thing. I don't know. There is 3 water sources and chances are good you've been drinking the bad one that makes you go crazy. I guess. There are a bunch of journel pages scattered around the world and reading them only makes it more confusing.\n\nIn summary, you walk around a pretty cool looking world and you read stuff, try to go down as many paths as possible to discover as much as you can,for the sake of doing it not for helping reveal anything about the story, and then the game ends.\n\nI bought this for $5 and I felt that between the scenery, the screenshots I took for my desktop wallpapers , and the sounds it was worth that at the most. It takes around 2 hours to finish. I would say there might be a certain amount of replay value if the story wasn't so convoluted and dull. It was hard to get going.

A value of about $2.5/hour is just the right price and if you can squeeze a third or maybe 4th hour exploring around a bit more, then that is good too.\n\nI have to give this a thumbs down.

It's not even a "walking simulator" (a game where your major/only action to complete it requires walking). I am saying this by making the arbitrary distinction that a "walking simulator" has an end, whether it be a quick, subtle finale, or a long, dramatic act. There is absolutely no narritive end here, and on face value, not much narrative going off at all, until you dig deep into the notes in the game.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, this is a beautiful experience, nice level design, emotive music. However, all of that means nothing here, because this isnt a game. Its wandering around and experiencing philosophy being told to you. There's only small hints in the later levels that the end of the story is coming, and then, upon one interaction, one little, pedestrian action you perform in thousands of other games, the credits roll.\n\nIt's a real let down after the experience as a whole. My personal feeling is that another "episode" is perhaps in the pipeline, as theres really no other explanation for having absolutely no ending at all.\n\nTheres a LOT of reading to do here, a few of "Solomon's notes" may take a good 30 minutes or so to read all the way through, but theres a lot of the actual story explained there.

My reading time for solomon's notes on their own would easily add another few hours on to that.\n\nIf you're after an interesting EXPERIENCE, and have a big interest in philosophy, and/or religion, then you can do much worse than give this a go.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/towelkiller/recommended/297350/","towelkiller","Towel Killer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/towelkiller/","377 products in account","My initial impression of this game was poor. The narration seemed like arrogant, pretentious rambling and the game immediately places you within a room that features six story notes to read. I swiftly tuned the narration out and after a few rooms stopped reading the notes. Finishing the game at about 2 hours, I was left fairly underwhelmed bar the very impressive graphics and occasional fantasy-like vistas.\n\nHowever, there must have been *something* there as for whatever reason I replayed the game immediately – this time reading the notes and listening to the narration (albeit with his volume reduced). I enjoyed it considerably more. One of the factors for this is that in the first few chapters of my first play through I had completely disregarded that some of the doors were labelled 'Exit'. This led to me actually missing entire scenes/events, with particular note to the first chapter where it arguably matters most when trying to engage a player. If I don't want to admit to being stupid, I chalk this up to modern gameplay and quite simply not having to care or pay attention to environmental details such as this in most games. Either way, I find it very odd that the developer intentionally gives you the ability to skip game sections in this manner. I don't understand how this makes sense in a linear game.\n\nAdditional Notes:\nIt's probably a technical consideration but the fade to black between certain doors and chapters sometimes hindered immersion. It would be fantastic if the levels could be streamed together, giving a better illusion of a complete world – or even an unexpected, disjointed entry into fantasy.\nWhen ending a level with a fall, the player can often be heard audibly landing.\nIt's the players own fault but during chapter introductions you can jump, making it sound a little silly.\nPerformance is pretty much rock solid bar chapter 11, which halved my framerate.\nMovement input is digital hence annoying with a gamepad – especially those with sticks that don't always sit neutral!\nThe run speed is quite pedestrian, bordering on tedious.","April 5, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I really like this particular..development we should call it, because it not only questions what video games are, but what they can be. This is an extremely provocative story. You must put all of the pieces together yourself, maybe even jot down a few notes on a piece of paper. You have to make assumptions, sometimes those assumptions can be proved with evidence scattered around. The idea is fantastic to me.\n\nAs for the game itself, there is no action. No enemies, nothing to get in the way of your examination of the city and the intensely beautiful graphics. there is a depressing and eerie atmosphere to the journey, and at some points it leaves you a bit spooked. I could praise this game all day, but you should experience it for yourself if you consider yourself an open minded gamer. Thinking is a priority in this game. It also leaves you with intense emotional feelings. The Old City has shown me that a video game can have the same effect on the human mind as music or film or any other form of art.\n\nSummary: I highly reccomend to give this a try if you have an open mind about video games. It's worth every penny to me and I consider The Old City: Leviathan to be a great work of art. It's quite literally a provocative piece of poetry in motion.\n\n7/10","January 17, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A mystery waiting to be solved. Depth and scale. Boundless intrigue. Instead it proves itself to be more shallow than Dear Esther.\n\nThe world itself, locked and running on high graphics in Unreal Engine 3, looks to be highly immersive and imaginative, this unique "game" is hindered by the fact that there is zero gameplay. Left mouse for zoom, E to opens doors, WASD to move, and left shift to walk a slightly faster pace. There is virtually zero learning curve, no challenge, no puzzle to solve, no guessing. There is a good sense of paranoia but it subsides by the third chapter.\n\nWhen reading the typed letters that are stuck to the walls throughout the game you get a sense of an almost sci-fi story: a falling away happened where humanity simply gave up, years later three factions came to power and started fighting over what to do next and what to do with their own freedoms, there is something in the water, a few names, and that's it. While you gather what little information there is you may find yourself uncaring as to what happened.\n\nWhile the narrator drones on and on about dreams and reality and suicide, you come across some VERY disturbing images of people having hung themselves, bled out, starved, etc. Some of these being children. I should mention that this game does not come with a trigger warning, just a message saying that all you see is not real. I consider myself a stable-minded individual but it shook me to where I had to turn the camera and sidestep past them.\n\nIts tagged on Steam as a "walking simulator," and that seems very apropos, if you explore every nook and cranny and the suddenly unveiling pathways, you'll rack up a total of 3 hours play time. At least Dear Esther was and still is cheap to buy. In that game you gather quickly what's happened to the character you're controlling and somehow feel connected. Its meant to bring you sadness. The visual is a vehicle to the deeper points. Leviathan attempts a story but is interrupted by itself, its trying to show you something while telling you something else unrelated.\n\nMaybe I'm not smart enough to pay attention to the point the game was trying to make, maybe the art of the game just serves a deeper and mindful purpose, maybe I'm too impatient and need something to happen while I play a game, or maybe having players walk around for 3 hours with nothing to do but read and listen makes for a lousy "game."","June 17, 2015","false","2.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

This game however just doesn't quite acheive it. It seems to be loosely based on the biblical story of Jonah and the Whale which is a fantastic story with wonderful imagery; great stuff to base this kind of game on. My problem however, is that there is basically no plot, what the protagonist says is usually pretty poetic babble with a loose basis in actually very interesting philosophy.\n\nThe "plot" is more like an idea for a post apocalyptic world order based on three opposing philosophical doctrines: extreme  religion (there is no truth but God), extreme atheism (there is no God but truth) and extreme agnosticism (there is no truth, period). These all have their justifications which you explore by reading the various posters and book pages scattered everywhere.\n\nMy biggest problem however, was the actual gameplay; you have no way of knowing whether you will progress to the next level if you open a door. That means that you can't be sure you've explored everywhere before moving on which means its almost inevitable that you do not have the complete story (not that there's much coherant progression anyway). What this means is that I was perpetually in the dark about what was really going on, who I was, where I was gong or why and where everyone else was.\n\nThe most impressive scene was the last part where you enter the whale but instead of reaching some new place that might give you some indication of what it was all for, you end up where you started. Perhaps its all an elaborate metaphor for the spiritual journey of Jonah but really, I'd have preferred more guidance for that.\n\nYou can collect secret stashes of documents written by another character you never see "Solomon", but when I saw how long they were I did not want to read them. So the only vaguely interesting part of the actual gameplay (I love finding secrets and collectibles) became completely undesirable.\n\nSince the pictures looked so pretty (and the game is pretty; the light is beautifully rendered and some of the landscapes are stunningly surreal) I was quite dissappointed in the lack of variety in the environments (but maybe I'm demanding a bit too much from the developers here).\n\nGenerally, I'm sad to say, I was disappointed in the game.","January 12","false","1.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The graphics are beautiful, surreal, inspiring, magestic. I spent a consideral amount of time geting screenshots of all the beautiful imagery. I never thought something like this could be in a videogame. The scenery, added with the simple gameplay, is relaxing, but expect a few gory images to give the player of more realistic idea or timeframe of the post apocalyptic period.\n\nIn this game there are no puzzles expect to decide which door to go through. You walk through the whole game to discover an old civilization gone. There are no jumpscares, no weapons, no conversations to anyone, only internal thoughts of the player's character, as you're seeing through his eyes and experiencing what he is seeing.\n\nMy only complaints about this game is that when you run, your pace is that of a jog or fast walk, so backtracking is a pain. The second would have to be the story which itself is very deep and detailed, but yet seriously convoluted just all over. I myself had much toruble figuring out what was going on and why it was going on. The only ideas you get as to what is happening is by reading typed-out notes or by listening to your character inner thoughts, but even listening to his thoughts made you think he was an intelectual person going insane, or just plain mental, but in most parts not in a bad way as what he drempt of was fantasical, but...\n\nI highly reccomend this game to just relax and get deeply involved in the story unfolding and that has unfolded in The Old City.\n\n\nNOTE: This is my personal opinion and thoughts of the game, not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research.","January 2, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The only thing you will ever do in this game is walk. You wander around several abandoned areas discovering pieces of narration (which was quite good) and notes which vary in quality. On occasion, you will bump into a little cube which gives you one of "Solomon's Notes". These things take a LONG time to read and are probably the equivalent of 10 pages of reading per note (there are seven total). While I don't mind reading, when I play a video game, I want to actually PLAY the game and not read it. The music and atmospheric sounds are incredibly good and create an eerie atmosphere. I'll be honest in saying, I didn't complete the game because I didn't find the story compelling enough to suffer through any more of the slow plodding through this abandoned complex. My only assumption as to why all these walking simulator "games" have such slow movement speed is because you could blast through them in fifteen minutes if you could move at any decent kind of speed. This game will probably run you about two hours if you skip reading Solomon's notes. I made it to chapter 5/7 in about 100 minutes. Exploration is excruciating because of the slow movement speed and really made me weigh whether the little bits of exposition were valuable enough for me suffer through the journey to look around everywhere. The story itself is quite confusing. There are a great many biblical allusions, symbols, and allegories. The names Jonah and Solomon are both used (Jonah being the man swallowed by a giant fish for three days and Solomon being the son of David, one of the great kings of Israel) and Jerusalem and another town (I can't remember the name but recognized it as being mentioned in the bible) are also referred to. There are two groups, one called The Guild, the other's name I've already forgotten. They appear to be at odds. The identity of the character you play was not revealed to me in my experience. The game probably has some pretty cool stuff in it if you feel like reading the novel that was put in Solomon's notes and finding every piece of dialogue and reading every note pinned to the wall. For me, I couldn't justify wasting the time on it to find out. I got this for 75% off at $2.49.

The graphics are lovely and as you play through the game, provided that you really look into the surroundings as you do, hold quite a bit of in-depth and minute detail that is incredibly immersive. Ryan Cooper, the only voice you ever hear, does a great job. He pulls off tiny little details in his voice acting that really make him and the game that much more "real". The music is perfect, the sound effects too for that matter, both are handled with skill and know when and where to be used. Meaning, the sound effects are never jarring, but sound completely natural to your surroundings. While the music is noticeable without taking your attention away from what you're doing, and swells in all the right parts, not to mention it's just lovely music.\n\nIf you look to the user-defined tags you'll see "walking simulator" is used and it's a very apt description as interactive wise, that's all you do... well, walk and read anyway. The visual and aural splendor of the game alone are sure to keep you enthralled. That being said, everything else there to the game, by which I mean the story, is sure to be divisive. The story is really meandering, slowly making its way this way and that and at times is plain hard to follow. I don't mean that in a bad way, it's still engaging and is in no way boring (at least not to me). However, I really had to make an effort to read the first two of Solomon's notes (seven notes scattered through out the game which help to pull the story into something more cohesive), as they weren't exactly written in a style I particularly enjoy, but I liked them by the end.\n\nThe Old City: Leviathan gives you a truly intriguing world to explore and is happy to let you explore it without tacked on and arbitrary puzzles, jump scares, or superfluous gameplay mechanics. It sounds as though it would be boring, but it is anything but.

The game will take hold of them where they are and lift them into a new world, guiding them and teaching them. The Old City fails to do that. Instead it alienates the player with wilfully obtuse language and bores them with a complete disregard for pacing.\n\nCreating a game that is entirely exploration with a single narrator is challenging indeed. Although we have seen how effective it can be when done right, such as in Portal and The Stanley Parable, the difference between those games and this highlights the need to speak TO your audience, not AT them. Flat monologues with sentences such as "An assertion from an assumption is still an assertion, making any deduction from that foundation subject to critique." and "Epistemic humility can regress to the deconstruction of stagnation." distract the player from the immersion of the game, and break the illusion that the person speaking is the character they are controlling. It is hard to get into a first-person character when they are practically speaking a language you do not understand.\n\nGames such as Doom 3, Bioshock, and The Last of Us (particularly the starting acts of each of these games) show us how well a world can be portrayed through notes, events, and other environmental clues around you. In fact the opening segments of each of those games works without any of the main game action. Coming back to The Stanley Parable again we can see how well pacing can be managed with the narrator filling in the gaps of otherwise mindless travel. Imagine, if you will, a long corridor or expanse that stretches before you. You know that you must walk to the far edge of that space. In The Old City this is mostly done in silence which, while it gives you a moment to appreciate the obvious beauty of the landscape, soon falls into dull trudgery. Not helped by the many times when you must travel back to point X to explore the other fork in the pathway as the one you have been following has lead to a dead end.\n\nOn a technical note, the lack of advanced video controls make this game hard to tweak to run on lower end systems. You can turn motion blur off, change the resolution, and that is about all. As a result it ran very clippy on my steam-powered crank-started laptop (no one's fault but my own I know).\n\nAll in all a dissapointment. There was so much potential here for an incredible experience, however the flaws above coupled with the lack of richness in the environment (particularly a complete lack of anything to interact with in any form) mean that I would not recommend it to anyone.","February 15","false","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In some areas I found the lighting odd/extreme. Windows did not always match up with incoming light, and the closer I looked at certain areas of detail, the easier it was to see that not everything was quite "perfect." However, it is still an incredible game to walk through, but it also wasn't exactly something my system felt even remotely taxed to run. I personally wasn't "hovering over F12."\n\nStory wise this game is highly philosophical and if you're not familiar with certain biblical stories, and even a few ancient greek mythologies, the concept behind this game is probably going to have a hard time sticking with you. Given that, it wasn't badly interpretted, and there is further/deeper meaning behind the story that I feel most (almost all) don't actually preceive.\n\nBuilding on that, my personal /critique/ of the game is that it is not delivered in a form that the player can unify their experiences with the narrator--in a fashion that keeps them driven on the same path--through a desire to understand, and grow, within the exploration of the Leviathan in order to walk them coherently along the structured philosophy of the game and its totality. The game lacks an event or trigger to bring them into the world more cohesively in such a way as to encourage their aimless wanderings and  intellectualization; this may inherently be a downside to the nature of a walking-simulator style game and its inept ability to do more than mosey.\n\nOverall I think it is unfortunate that the deeper concepts are missed, and likely will never be realized if the indie group doesn't manage to continue in their second and third games that Leviathan is supposed to be a triology from. The walking-simulator aspect of it could have done with a faster "run" option to help facilitate a more effecient experience for those who desire it (I know I wanted to double the pace often). Combined with good, but not (in my opinion) stunning visuals, there isn't really anything that immediately brings me to recommend this game.","February 4","false","6.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I don't mean that in a bad way, it's still engaging and is in no way boring (at least not to me). However, I really had to make an effort to read the first two of Solomon's notes (seven notes scattered through out the game which help to pull the story into something more cohesive), as they weren't exactly written in a style I particularly enjoy, but I liked them by the end.\n\nThe Old City: Leviathan gives you a truly intriguing world to explore and is happy to let you explore it without tacked on and arbitrary puzzles, jump scares, or superfluous gameplay mechanics. It sounds as though it would be boring, but it is anything but. I look forward to the day when this world is (hopefully) expanded upon.","March 21, 2015","true","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In some areas I found the lighting odd/extreme. Windows did not always match up with incoming light, and the closer I looked at certain areas of detail, the easier it was to see that not everything was quite "perfect." However, it is still an incredible game to walk through, but it also wasn't exactly something my system felt even remotely taxed to run. I personally wasn't "hovering over F12."\n\nStory wise this game is highly philosophical and if you're not familiar with certain biblical stories, and even a few ancient greek mythologies, the concept behind this game is probably going to have a hard time sticking with you. Given that, it wasn't badly interpretted, and there is further/deeper meaning behind the story that I feel most (almost all) don't actually preceive.\n\nBuilding on that, my personal /critique/ of the game is that it is not delivered in a form that the player can unify their experiences with the narrator--in a fashion that keeps them driven on the same path--through a desire to understand, and grow, within the exploration of the Leviathan in order to walk them coherently along the structured philosophy of the game and its totality. The game lacks an event or trigger to bring them into the world more cohesively in such a way as to encourage their aimless wanderings and  intellectualization; this may inherently be a downside to the nature of a walking-simulator style game and its inept ability to do more than mosey.\n\nOverall I think it is unfortunate that the deeper concepts are missed, and likely will never be realized if the indie group doesn't manage to continue in their second and third games that Leviathan is supposed to be a triology from. The walking-simulator aspect of it could have done with a faster "run" option to help facilitate a more effecient experience for those who desire it (I know I wanted to double the pace often). Combined with good, but not (in my opinion) stunning visuals, there isn't really anything that immediately brings me to recommend this game.","February 4","false","6.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Many of the views were breathtaking, and I enjoyed its attempt at philosophy. However... It often felt like the author was trying *too hard* to make their philosophical points, often obscuring them with over-the-top language. I was frequently taken out of the moment questioning why the author/developer chose to needlessly cloud their statements or simply repeat them in a different, still esoteric way.\n\n\nI just have to say I find it interesting that a game so heavily focused on the futility of ideological conflict relied so heavily on Jewish mythology during its storytelling.","May 28","false","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I assumed it was a game. PostMod Softworks’ The Old City: Leviathan is not so much a game as it is an “interactive storytelling experience”. Imagine The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, Anna, or Dear Esther, but take away anything resembling a game element.\n\nThrough reading all these notes in a fading world, you get a true idea of how alone you are. The only people you see are dead or made of stone and the character even admits to being an isolationist. There are constant signs of decay and destruction and the music is sparse and singular, aiding in the idea of desolation. This world, the constant talking to yourself and scattered journal notes creates an atmosphere pure loneliness. While this is done well, the game still lacks something… narrative. You don’t really know what you’re doing, you don’t know why you’re there, you have no real reason to progress. A lack of compulsion, people and driving events makes this interactive story a little dull, not to mention a slow and tedious delivery of information\n\nI struggled with this interactive story because I wanted some sense of purpose, some goal, some end point which would result in satisfaction. Ideas are scattered, stories are bogged down by mountains of text and the narrator is unreliable. When reading a novel, you want to reach end while constantly wanting to avoid it, all because you’re enjoying yourself. But I didn’t enjoy the story or the experience. Maybe that was the purpose of the experience. Not to be enjoyed, but to make you think about the sparse existence this “minotaur” has. If you’re after philosophical discourse set in an interesting, post-apocalyptic, unsettling world from the eyes of an unreliable narrator, then this is the story for you.\n\nFor full review, visit:\nhttp://icarusreviews.net/2015/01/19/the-old-city-leviathan/","January 20, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a 'walking simulator' through and through, so you have to like the genre (and I do).\n\nAt their best, the environments in this game are breathtaking - really inventive. Other parts look like a sewer level from Half-Life.\n\nGames of this sort often use the 'found book' method for exposition, and The Old City turns this up to 11. There are screens and screens of stuff - most of which I skimmed. Luckily, none of this is required for finishing the game (phew).

The brick undergrounds are monotonous, but all the other environments are very interesting. The voice over gives you just enough to grab on to and some interesting ideas to chew on.\n\nDear Esther is probably a little more accessible than this, but only because this requires some reading in addition to listening and has a much more subtle ending.

Those looking for clear-cut objectives, indicators on where to go and in what order to do things and a narrative that's easy to follow, doesn't leave itself open to many interpretations and doesn't assault the player with philosophical ideas expounded in lengthy sentences will feel frustrated and likely unable to enjoy the experience.\n\nHowever, if you like pondering the deeper meaning behind the protagonist's monologues or journal entries found throughout the environments, or enjoy seeing the world through someone else's eyes and listening to others' perceptions of places, people and facets of dreams and reality, all the while exploring beautiful or moody environments accompanied with a suitably evocative soundtack, The Old City is a tale that's really worth experiencing, in my opinion.\n\nIt's not an easy tale to follow (especially if english is not your native language) and some of the connections might not dawn on the player until subsequent playthroughs of the various chapters, but there are no challenges, tasks or jump scares to distract you from collecting all the tidbits of information, so the story can be unfolded at your own pace.\n\nThe trailers on the store page might suggest a very gruesome, dark tone to the game's story, and while there certainly are eerie, gloomy parts of it, the overall experience in my opinion is a positive and uplifting one, once you've learned to accept the characters' personalities. If slower paced, thought-provoking games are your stuff, do yourself a favour and get The Old City: Leviathan.","January 2, 2015","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When reading a novel, you want to reach end while constantly wanting to avoid it, all because you’re enjoying yourself. But I didn’t enjoy the story or the experience. Maybe that was the purpose of the experience. Not to be enjoyed, but to make you think about the sparse existence this “minotaur” has. If you’re after philosophical discourse set in an interesting, post-apocalyptic, unsettling world from the eyes of an unreliable narrator, then this is the story for you.\n\nFor full review, visit:\nhttp://icarusreviews.net/2015/01/19/the-old-city-leviathan/","January 20, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't mind admitting I didn't completely get what this game was trying to impart. Something profound about metaphysics, I think.\n\nDespite this, it's well worth a play if you liked Dear Esther, which it greatly resembles. It's a 'walking simulator' through and through, so you have to like the genre (and I do).\n\nAt their best, the environments in this game are breathtaking - really inventive. Other parts look like a sewer level from Half-Life.\n\nGames of this sort often use the 'found book' method for exposition, and The Old City turns this up to 11.

Stunning, immersive environments coupled with a really effective soundtrack make for an engaging experience that is, in my opinion, worth every penny.\n\nAs others have pointed out, at times the narrative is confusing bordering on nonsensical, but as I listened to and read through it, I felt like that was the point. The game opens with a warning about the state of mind of the narrator, and I think the writers did a good job of portraying this through his occasional input as you explore the world. Think Dear Esther, but even less coherent. Despite this, there is a somewhat discernible story which becomes apparent as you progress.\n\nOne other point which people have raised is that there is no save function in the game. This is true, but I really didn't find it to be an issue because it only took me a few hours to complete the game in one sitting even with very thorough exploration of each chapter.\n\nHonestly, this game won't be for everyone, as is the case with most 'walking simulators' - though I have to say, I've come to dislike that term because all too often it's used dismissively as if to suggest that the game in question isn't a 'real' game. Games like this are a welcome change from those which hold your hand all the way through and point you straight towards whichever enemy you're supposed to shoot at next, and for that reason, so-called 'walking simulators' are fast becoming my favourite genre.\n\nRegardless of whether you've played games of this genre before, if you're open to the idea of spending a few hours just exploring a surreal but beautiful in-game world without any enemies or puzzles, get this game, set aside the time to play it all the way through and just enjoy the experience.\n\n","January 13, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You got a heavy-handed mix of militant theists, obnoxious atheists, agnostics, and 'minotaurs' who follow a sort of zen philosophy and deny notions of sureness or defined lines, where truth's self-compatibility is only as relevant as our ability to perceive a truth as being totally objective. Essentially, it's allegorical and recontextualises characters from religious texts to question the nature of reality and our 'knowledge' of it.\n\nIntertwining are four basic directions of story-telling. You've got\n\n1. the environment and the incredibly unsubtle hints they give\n2. notes on the walls scrawled/type by fellow minatours (mostly)\n3. the most angsty edgelord shoite I've EVER seen written that not even the depths of the most militant teenage atheist's Myspace page could probe\n4. the monologue of what is presumed to be the protagonist, you walking through a series of dreams and 'realities' only that part isn't so clear and everything's all a bit wibbly because not knowing and fear of the unknown plus the trauma of basically the world falling udders-up generally puts a downer on things. other minotaurs seem to be like this, too.\n\nAnyhow, things happen. You don't do much at all. If anything this is a philosophical puzzle game but it does at least make sense if you pay attention, and that's what most walking-simulators tend to struggle with, more likely due to a dense audience than a broken expository method. It's a fairly bog-standard interactive exploration experience only with a HEAVY dose of philosophising.\n\nOh, and it looks AMAZING. There aren't many games that I'd say are worth playing simply for the aesthetics and visual design but this is one of them. It's really hard to be mean to something this beautiful. Would you be mean to a puppy? Honestly, it looks stunning and there is a lot of variety in the environments despite it at first looking like a grey industrial level explorer. Admittedly it almost seems like the dev was trying their hand at different environments and got carried away, almost feeling like a technical exercise at times but DAT ARTISTIC DIRECTION. I'm not so hot on the way some statues are placed as they look a little out of place and enlarged/copy+pasted but to end this poor little writeup, despite having some absolutely monstrous flaws which are borderline unforgivable this is something anyone with any sort of deeper interest in games as art, as more than just a medium used for shooting black people in deserts, should play. It's interesting, if a little slow to start, has depth, leaves you with more questions than answers, and is both self-contained and nebulous in its interpretability. Very solid. Very very solid.\n\nIDK, I don't like giving numbers. As a standalone work, 6.5/10. How much I enjoyed it? How much it ended up exciting, intriguing and annoying me? 7-8/10. It's got a lot to offer and it's what is between the lines that you can't really gague and rate that makes it special, if only for a while. If you're choosing between this and another Call Of Jingoism, choose this. Even if you hate it, it'll open new doors to you.","August 1, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its labyrinthine levels are sumptuously designed and evocative, somewhere between City 17 and Giorgio de Chirico.\n\nThe writing isn't as bad as some of the other reviews have made it sound--the game definitely feels pretentious, and it has some pacing issues, but if you can look past that, there's an interesting (if heavy-handed) meditation on futility and truth to be found here--very Kafka-Lite. The best bits are definitely the ancillary notes and text posted around the game's environment, which represent the views of people who've lived in the game's mysterious environment and struggled with the miserable emptiness of it.\n\nUnfortunately, the narrator you're saddled with spends most of the game as the sort of nihilistic, dull teenager who just discovered Nietzsche and wants to sound important. It's not a dealbreaker--like all good fictional characters, he undergoes a change as the story goes along--but it definitely drags down what feels like a thoughtful experience into something that feels pedantic and not half as smart as it thinks it is.\n\nAll told, though, if you like walking simulators, thought-provoking narratives and environmental storytelling, it's easy to look past the narration and enjoy The Old City.","April 2","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But in a good way.\nFirst of all I would like to say that this is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played, not only because of the graphics but more because of the design, if you know what I mean. Once you've seen the palace-esque buildings overgrown with plants and the light coming through cathedral windows you will understand.\nAlso it has a really nice atmosphere, melancholy at times, frightening at others, and always perfectly accentuated with music. There are elements of gore, bodies lying around etc. and you are constantly at edge but it's very well done.\nThen there's the bible quotes and symbolism, and I'm always a fan of that. It's subtle and probably to be overlooked if you rush through but this is really not the game for rushing (though it is quite short, unfortunately. But maybe the concept wouldn't have carried over a longer span of time ... who knows.)\nAs for the story: although I am fairly sure I've read all the pages hanging around and read through all of Solomon's notes (they are quite lengthy and a bit over to top, in my opinion, though interesting) and yet I wouldn't say that I can see a full picture of what is going on. There are clearly distinguishable characters and obvious relations but no real story to speak of and quite a lot ominous bits of information. And it gets really philosophical at times.\nBut then again, I really liked that. It makes you go through possible outcomes in your head and has you trying to figure it all out instead of sitting back and just consuming it. Some may say that it is pretentious and actually quite pointless but in my opinion a game (like this) doesn't have to get a point across or educate you. Still enjoyed it.\nAND, a big plus is that there are no jumpscares and no enemies to kill or hide from. That would totally have killed it for me. You will hardly encounter any living things in this game (only people you meet are dead or ... turned into stone? Are they statues? Hmm.) and that's good because the atmosphere of decay and hopelessness really profits from it.\n'nuff said. The pictures say pretty much all. And you should be an avid reader if you want to have fun with this.","February 28","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is very non-linear, and hard to explore everything. The graphics are great, and the music is good. However that's where it ended for me.\nThe story is way too confusing, and mostly just the narrator sprouting fancy words. The game clearly wants to give a clever story, but overused metaphors. The lighting in the game is pretty dark. While it is possible to see, it still feels a little too dark. Most of the light is orange-ish in the inside areas, which causes it to look like it's all candles even when it is other things like light bulbs. A light bulb would normally give a brighter light and make it way easier to see. Heck, I'm in my room right now. It's dark, no light coming from outside and only my ceiling light lit but it still looks brighter than the beginning area of the game which even has light from the outside coming in. And the other thing is, why are all light bulbs giving off orange light? Did they not have fluorescent light at the time? Back to the story, there is on thing the game never explains you. What are the locations you see? Yes, we know it is a dream, but what are we seeing them for? What is that small room we saw three times? Your son's room? What is that recurring room we see with the three tables and window? It's strange how the game doesn't explain these to you, or perhaps I just missed them.\nAs always, do watch out. As can be seen in the tags this is a walking simulator, which means that it heavily relies on walking without much interaction. Do watch out if you are not into these kinds of games.\nHere's my playthrough if anyone is interested.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbBjoGTz_G4ojwNT0Et3WEvo6IveIG27z","January 23","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I  will admit, it was a different experience.\n\nPROS\n\nThis game is gorgeous, beautiful. I ran it with a slower processor than called for, but most of the game still held up beautifully and I found myself wanting to see more, even when there was no more to see.\n\nThe voice over was done well, the tidbits I found around the game were philosophical and did feel as if I was part of the conversation. The triggering of said monologues was odd, and I'm not exactly sure what sets them off. Decent job overall.\n\nCONS\n\nFor a game with no mechanic other than walking, I would have hoped that the walking was a bit faster. Of course I stopped to see the scenes, but without sprinting I'm sure my playtime would have been double what it is now. The normal speed is painfully slow.\n\nThe hidden journals around the world contain notes that are incredibly dense. While interesting at first, they can degrade into what feels like Solomon's thesis being submitted for review. This became so bad that I didn't go past the second note.\n\nMany of the levels feel very obviously like simple forks. There is a path that leads to the exit and a path that leads to narrations. It became a trial of walking down one path, realizing that was they way I'm supposed to go, and subsequently going back to go down the other. Sort of annoying really.\n\n\nVERDICT\n\nWonderful game for one wanting to see the sights and wrangle with some philosophical thought. I'd say go ahead and give it a shot, but wait for a sale.","January 3","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would recommend picking this game on the sale if you want a chill out and passive, but enjoyable experience.","March 25","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Interaction is via the E key on a keyboard.  I tried using a conroller but was left feeling a bit dizzy.  When you do emerge from labyrinthine tunnels and corridors it feels amazing.  The voice commentary of the story teller is good.  I did not read all the signs and missed a few of Solomon's notes, but I gathered quite a lot from the text I did read.  There is always the option of diving into any particular chapter and exploring further.\nOverall I greatly enjoyed the experience.  After the 1st chapter I was hooked.  There is much to ponder over.  A worthwhile experiment.","April 10","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its labyrinthine levels are sumptuously designed and evocative, somewhere between City 17 and Giorgio de Chirico.\n\nThe writing isn't as bad as some of the other reviews have made it sound--the game definitely feels pretentious, and it has some pacing issues, but if you can look past that, there's an interesting (if heavy-handed) meditation on futility and truth to be found here--very Kafka-Lite. The best bits are definitely the ancillary notes and text posted around the game's environment, which represent the views of people who've lived in the game's mysterious environment and struggled with the miserable emptiness of it.\n\nUnfortunately, the narrator you're saddled with spends most of the game as the sort of nihilistic, dull teenager who just discovered Nietzsche and wants to sound important. It's not a dealbreaker--like all good fictional characters, he undergoes a change as the story goes along--but it definitely drags down what feels like a thoughtful experience into something that feels pedantic and not half as smart as it thinks it is.\n\nAll told, though, if you like walking simulators, thought-provoking narratives and environmental storytelling, it's easy to look past the narration and enjoy The Old City.","April 2","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
