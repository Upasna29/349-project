In all honesty, this is one of the worst games I have EVER played, and I played Gettysberg, Ride to Hell: Retribution and Afterfall Insanity. The soundtrack is awful, the gameplay is awful, the design (for a game like this - similar to Ikaruga) is awful, the controls function well so at least the developer got that right. Initially you are thrown into the most non-sensical cutscene I have watched in a long time, and no, it's not me that got it wrong, it's them, then the voice acting.. Terrible, apparently the voice actress has won awards? Probably the most dull and awfully acted voice in the history of gaming. Then there is the game itself. It just makes no sense, even in it's joke of a fantasy universe. It is incredibly unhelpful and gives no instruction other than dialogue that makes no sense and is spaced out like a baby let loose on Microsoft Office Word. The constant flickering signs of the neon dialogue just hurts your eyes. They should have an epilepsy warning but then again epileptics would never set hands on this joke. Either way I got this game for free and you know what? It wasn't even worth it. Steam should PAY ME to take this crap. Also the aspects of religion make no sense. Developer, read the bible again and again until you are too old to make another game.\n(Rating = 13/100)","October 27, 2014","false","1.3"," 207 of 246 people (84%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","84","207","246","23","11"

The story is non-existant, with completely detached, shoddy gameplay and controls; you shoot random asteroids that randomly burst into bibles to raise your "faith" from 200 to 1000 while Uriel's Chasm floats around the map with you, as if any of that has any religious context. The graphics are very basic and mostly hand-drawn, some of which even look like notebook scans of real pencil drawings.\n\nI would have played this game to completion, since it is a quick and mindless shooter, but the controls are incredibly bad. An arena space shooter should have omnidirectional controlling. It's a necessity for every game in the genre. Unfortunately, this game is ONLY controlled with arrow keys, meaning that you can ONLY shoot in the eight basic combinations in which you can fly. There isn't even cursor aiming. You have to be aligned with a diagonally-moving asteroid to shoot it while you close in on it, then it breaks into smaller asteroids which are almost impossible to shoot but easy to run into. Also, you lose faith for being hit with asteroids AND running into the giant, invincible Uriel's Chasm previously mentioned.\n\nIt is a negative experience in every way. I can't believe they want people to pay money for it.","October 31, 2014","false","1.4"," 99 of 109 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","99","109","4","0"

(Here's looking at you, Blast Em.)\n\nThe visuals are weird, the gameplay is janky, and I probably won't play it ever again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeugziumy/recommended/292630/","zeugziumy","Zeugziumy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeugziumy/","223 products in account","(This Review may contain Spoilers)\n\nUriel's Chasm is a very weird shoot-em-up/side-scrolling shooter/platformer, the shooting sections are "Bullet Hell", term considered for games with a lot of bullets in the screen while having you to dodge.\n\n- First things first -\n\nThis game is religious and really disturbing. Let's make some notes before actually starting on the game.\n1- The game is always in fullscreen and you can't change it to windowed (F2 is usually a common hotkey to toggle fullscreen in games made in Gamemaker and other engines);\n2- You also can't bind your own controls, and the game does not provide you instructions, it just throws you on the level without explaining anything;\n3- The game has no pause function, and if you press "Esc" by thinking you're going to pause, you're going to go all way back to the main menu and then first level of the game;\n4- The beginning of the game starts with a camera-recorded scene with two women, called by themselves as "Shovelware Queens", I didn't really listened to that, but along the progress of the game, you may hear and watch more of these parts (including a guy later on). The quality is abysmal and there is no subtitles either. I didn't wanted to actually turn up my volume because it could be a prank (as if the game wasn't already).\n\n- Story and Levels -\n\nThe story of the game, by all honesty, I don't know. It's a religious story that follows really weird by each level (I couldn't follow the story due it's bizarreness).\n\nThe first stage of the game is a shooter like the game Asteroids, from the Arcade. Your mission is to get enough "Faith" to proceed to the Garden. You can shoot with Z and move your ship with the Arrow Keys. You have a Life energy and Fuel energy. Moving it too much will consume fuel, and losing health by touching the Asteroids will also drain your health. There is also a big spinning jaw on the level (seen also on the Story cutscenes), that drain your health almost instantly.\n\nThe second stage is a side-scrolling shooter, you have 3 hearts (each hit takes a half of a heart) and you have to reach to the end by destroying baddies.\n\nThe third stage is a platformer that you need to rescue some people that will give you some descriptions after each one is free. Find all ten and proceed to the weirdest part of the game.\n\nThe fourth stage, by all honest, I haven't beat. The game had a huge difficulty spike (the difficult increased greatly between the first three levels to the fourth). You have to kill a boss on a Shoot-n-up style that you can only go Left and Right, and again, you only got 3 hearts. The boss shoots really fast projectiles that I can't even dodge so well. The design of the boss and the stage is really disturbing, which is also another reason why I didn't want to beat this level and this game.\n\nI don't know if there are other stages, but I read this game is relatively short.\n\n- Game art -\n\nUriel's Chasm art is not pretty. It attempts to make it retro, but there's also too much stuff on the screen (like the big spinning jaw). The graphics tries to be somewhere between 8-bit and 16-bit, but it fails miserably. The music, is bad, some levels have cool musics, but the rest may be very generic musics with no tension for that level. There is no fourth level music, you only get a lot of people screams.\n\n- Conclusions -\n\nI don't recommend this game for being really short, bad art (Music, graphics and story), being way too expensive (even though I got this for free, I do not like it) and really disturbing. If you get this game for free like me, and you wanted it only because the Steam Trading Cards, please do not play it, keep it on the Main Menu and Mute your computer's volume, and after you're done with, uninstall and never touch it again.\n\n3/10","January 9, 2015","false","1.2"," 53 of 60 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","53","60","5","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/292630/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Uriel’s Chasm is a game that many people will not love and will not enjoy. It’s a different sort of game and it doesn’t happen very often that I play a game this weird. Naturally, the word ‘weird’ can be interpreted both ways here, but I mean it in a negative sense, I’m afraid.\n\nThe game is approximately 30 minutes long and it’s unclear, unfocused, amateuristic  and, above all, pretentious.\nIt’s supposedly about religion and faith. That’s what the ‘story’ led me to believe anyway. But this story mostly consists of (seemingly random) Bible verses, sometimes spoken by a person that clearly has no passion doing this.\nThe FMVs are also uninteresting and, in my opinion, hardly add anything to the entire game.\n\nGameplay-wise the game consists of several genres; you start the game in a ship shown for a top-down perspective and it’s your goal to collect more faith than what’s in the garden. This can be done by shooting meteorites while also avoiding them and one, large, rotating monster (I think ?).\nMeteorites will sometimes drop bible verses, which you can then collect to increase your faith meter. You have to take into account that moving will decrease your fuel meter and hitting enemies will decrease your faith meter. Shooting your guns will also deplete your ammo meter. If any meter completely depletes it is game over.\nIf you’ve collected enough faith the game will continue to the next part which is a side-scrolling shooter. The goal there is shoot your enemies or to just avoid their gunfire and kill the boss at the end of the level. Looks simple, but the collision detection is poor and as a result is sometimes fairly frustrating.\nThe last part is a platformer. You just jump around finding trees/crosses that show you verses from the Bible. There are no enemies and you can’t die here. But the level does rotate so it might be a bit confusing and disorienting to some. This should be simple enough for most of us.\nLike I said, all of this takes approximately 30 minutes or 1 hour max if maybe you don’t play many games.\n\nThe graphics are retro and in 2D, which look ok. Some of the graphics are a bit hideous but overall it all looks decent enough.\nAnd despite what you would think the music is pretty good. But that’s about the only real thing I enjoyed I guess.\nThe user interface is obtrusive and way out of proportion and clutters the screen. This is completely unnecessary. The text is also annoying to read, because it changes colors every second and, yes, this is also too big for the screen.\n\nSo, if you still haven’t got the impression that I didn’t enjoy this game then this review is probably worthless to you. But if it did make sense to you then I suggest you stay away from this game. Even if it goes on sale (which shouldn’t take that long if I had to take a guess).\nFaith in humanity: lost.\n\n[Rating: 42/100]","September 16, 2014","false","1.7"," 69 of 93 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","69","93","0","4"

After collecting enough  *faith* from the Bibles, the level is completed.   The music was incredible simple and repetitive, the kind of that can drive one crazy. Graphics is weird, but good for the game mode.\n\nSecond level:  Riding a bullet (or container, according to others who were able to read the terribly done ingame text ) While shooting down scapeships, tree-like things and crosses that shoot at you - to be honest I have no idea why this needed to be done, It was weird, the hitboxes are literal boxes ( Like when you copy something in pain with the cut tool - even though your drawing has a form of a tree or whatnot, it moves as a rectangle. Same with hitboxes here.)\n\nThird level was a really weird platforming like level: the lights were flickeing, still the maddening music, and I had to collect Jesuses (yes, plural) on crosses to get a Bible quote I had no time to read. before disappearing. Oh, and have I mentioned that the camera often rotates 120-180°? And that it's constantly moving?  Incredibly sickening level... but at least easy gameplay wise.\n\nFourth level was where I pressed escape to pause the game, but it just reseted to the title screen?\nA bullethell-shmup level when you have to kill a giant space-giraffe who has bloodshot eyes and shoots black and white flickering balls at you from said eyes, and as most of the background is black, it's almost impossible to dodge them. And to make it even worse, the most atricious soundtrack I ever heard: this is not a joke. Look up "Cat breakup" video on youtube. Note the cat sound. Then take someone saying eeeeeeeeeeuughhhh constantly, a girl sounding like wants to throw up and a other moans and groans. This is not my channel, and the guy is german, and pretty loud compared to the background sounds, but if you want to check it, you can find it here. Prepare yourself, it's OMG-level of terrible: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRvUApEf2gA\n\nDo you recommend this game?\nWell if you want to appreciate the playeable, bad, generic games around Steam, then playing Uriel's Chasm will surely help in doing that, as it redefines the term of a bad game. I has no original idea, have sickening visuals, techno-midi like music that makes you feel sick, the groaning-moaning sounds on the 4th level.. It's beyond terrible. I found the " omfg what the hell is this" reviews quite funny, but they are accurate. This is one of the worst (working) game I came across with.\nDon't give out money for this game, most of Kongregate can provide much better gamepay than this abomination.","January 24","false","2.0"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","97","31","32","5","1"

Unfortunately, if you're not of the age group to recognize that, or if you don't know this before you press "play," you'll give it five minutes, declare it the most horrible game ever made, and move on.\n\nI'm going to flirt with madness here and tell you it's [expletive deleted] BRILLIANT. From the lack of a pause key or an options menu, to the midi-based music, to the absolutely brutal gameplay, to the lack of pyrotechnics, to the anticlimactic area "wins," to the interlaced, grainy FMV (that's "full motion video" for those of you who weren't around before its existence)...all I can say is just...wow. For those who didn't experience computer gaming back in the early 1990s (just as CD-ROM drives were hitting the market), Uriel's Chasm very accurately replicates the exact experience of that era. Games were frequently nonsensical;  they often changed screens abruptly, they didn't hold your hand, they didn't provide tutorials, and they most  certainly didn't have giant arrows or yellow question marks to point you in the right direction.\n\nAs an actual game, once you get into it, Uriel's Chasm is challenging, unsettling and even a bit disturbing. Part of the purpose of this game (other than to take you back in time in a very real way) is to discover each new section and how to play on your own, so I won't spoil those moments for you here. What I will say, is that it very accurately represents what were three out of the four main styles of gameplay back in those days (the fourth being faux-3D shooters such as Catacombs 3D, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, et al), but skewed through Uriel's Chasm's own twisted lens.\n\nGame play is brutal and unforgiving, but that's kind of the point. The controls are extremely responsive, if not initially intuitive. It runs smoothly even on my three year-old big box computer, and there is a solid logic or pattern to each area (even the seemingly unbeatable final level).\n\nI came to Uriel's Chasm as an active Presbyterian Elder, curious about the Biblical aspects of the game, but that quickly became a non-event, as the experience took over. Nevertheless, there is some usage of Christian iconography that may be disturbing to some players (such as spinning crucifixes that fire bullets). Play time is pretty short but, as this is more about the experience than the actual game, that doesn't bother me. With all sincerity, and without any sarcasm, I tell you this : Uriel's Chasm is art. Most people won't agree with me. Most people won't get it. Most people won't like it.  I do. I do, and I absolutely recommend it to anyone who remembers what gaming was like back then and wants to relive the experience, those who are into hardcore gaming, or to those who are curious about it. All others should, as evidenced by the multitudes of negative reviews, pass it by.","December 9, 2014","true","2.8"," 88 of 136 people (65%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","65","88","136","21","6"

Let me start by first saying that I don't think Uriel's Chasm should be given a normal game review, as it is not a normal game, I would even hesitate to call it a game. It is both more and less than a game, it is an experience. It is most definitely not for everyone, it's not even for most people I would surmise; However if you are reading this review you contain that spark of interest, and in which case I recommend that you buy it (it's not very expensive) and try it for yourself.\n\nThe game contains 4 levels, the last was added in an update. The gameplay is simplistic, and excepting the last level not very challenging. The game is very short as well, probably about 30 minutes to beat, less once you know what you're doing.  Do not buy this for the gameplay, that is not where the appeal lies. I know that sounds counter-intuitive, but I am a firm believer of games as art; they can be for more than entertainment! I like gameplay just as much as the next gamer, and more than some, but sometimes I want more than empty entertainment. And art is exactly what this game is, make no mistake. The game literally calls itself rubbish, so I feel that people that complain about the gameplay are missing the point entirely.\n\nThe graphics are excellent, though primitive, and contain some very memorable images ( the hidden face especially ) that combine with the superb music to create an extremely surreal, trippy, oftentimes quite disturbing aesthetic. I cannot comment on the story other than to say it is 'out there' for sure. It is very obtuse and to me didn't make much sense. I am not the type of person to really read a bunch of stuff into something, I'm not very good at that. I can't deny though that it did conjure up some very powerful emotions, something very few games do.\n\nI could go on and still not be able to describe this game as it is something that needs to be experienced. If you have any interest I urge you to try it, form your own opinion. I feel sad that me and like 5 other ♥♥♥♥ing people like the game.","September 19, 2014","true","2.9"," 58 of 89 people (65%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","65","58","89","8","1"

I’m the type of person that can appreciate the joy of something so bad that it becomes good, but this game is simply bad on all levels. There is no possible way I could recommend Uriel’s Chasm, even as a joke.\n\nThe game begins with an incomprehensible video of what I can only assume are the creators talking directly into a camera about god knows what. They refer to themselves as the “Shovelware Queens” which foreshadows that everything to follow is some kind of sick joke or scam to rob you of your money. The player is then treated to several minutes of a "cinematic" with a text story that continuously flashes or fades away before returning, making it virtually impossible to read. Even worse, the cinematic cannot be skipped and you will have to watch it in its entirety every time you launch the game.\n\nThe actual gameplay involves flying a spacecraft around looking for bible verses and DMT (to power your ship's laser). Apparently collecting bible verses gives you faith which will help you beat "the garden". An over cluttered HUD that takes up more of the screen than necessary, the bottom half has a giant paragraph over explaining the simple premise of the game and the top left quarter of the screen is a large picture of your character.\n\nThe only conclusion I can make about Uriel’s Chasm is that it is a sad commentary on the lack of quality control for the games that are finding their way on to Steam. A game of this standard should never have passed approval and definitely should not be set at $4.99. I received my copy for free from a promotion genuinely pity anyone that was suckered into spending any money on this game. Do not purchase this game, and be wary of any future releases from these developers.","November 4, 2014","false","0.8"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","4"

Also it can't be measured by any standards because it is as art as taking a dump on a couch. On the second thought I think taking a dump on couch can be considered as some methaphor about modern society and thus means taking dump on a couch is more of an art than this 'game'. It's not even trash, because trash is a genre.\nThere's nothing inheritably good/bad/redeeming/obscure about this thing. It's just quick zero-effort attempt to get quick buck while doing nothing. It's obviously never even meant to have a single redeeming quality. It's just it - pretentious empty nothing that you'll forget after 15 minutes. The thing is it's not scam, it is obvious that developer is not even aware that this is just a cheap cashgrab and very proud of this thing. Good for him, eh? Must be some kind of revelation. You know, some guys p1ss on a wall and see a jesus - that kind of 'revelation'. It's not avant-garde, definitely not art, not bad, not controversial. This is just dumb and pathetic. This is the result when you want to be so artistic while having two-digit IQ. This developer is great example what you should avoid to become in life no matter what you do. But everyone is special, amirite? Yeah, you may be dumb and proud of your right to be dumb, but don't try to sell it to people.\n\nAlso I beat this 'game' in single playthrough the first time I launched it. If I had loser brother with low self-esteem, we'd be called Super Hipster Bros. Also it means I need 3 more hours to get trading cards from it. Or more.

New players are introduced to one Sister Tabitha, who both monologues about being asleep for years yet inexplicably also knows about events that trouble the world. Players are then immediately dropped into a space setting, in a spaceship, with text explaining that they must collect Bible verses via mining asteroids. The game also launches a HUD that has four different values on it, including "Faith" and "Fuel", and before even processing what the controls are, the ship is crushed by some massive unknown object and the level is reset. This madness encapsulates the experience of Uriel's Chasm well.\n\nThis game is ravenously difficult, and little of it comes from fair, legitimate sources. The game's interface provides no indication for new players on how to play the game. Naturally, players will discover on their own that the arrow keys move the ship, but no other keys seem to do anything. Only after stumbling about on the keyboard will one find that the Z key fires the weapon. The shots fired from the weapon often phase through smaller asteroids, making it unreliable at best. The lack of collision sound effects for when the ship takes damage or when asteroids are destroyed makes it even easier for those not paying attention to spontaneously die. Perhaps the greatest injustice this game offers is that it has no pause menu, meaning that gamers that naively assume some level of competence by the developers and press "Escape" during a level to pause will find themselves back at the beginning video sequence...which is unskippable. It's always unskippable. The unremovable Bible tracts that appear on the bottom of the screen during the first level in putrid green hues rounds out this spectrum of awefulness. The game's length is quite pathetically short at only four levels, though no player of sound mind will make it past the first. Perhaps it is merciful that this mess cannot last for long.\n\nThis game tries to save face by marketing itself as a satire of early religious videogames, with its lackluster interface and tough-as-nails difficulty serving as callbacks for nostalgia's sake. However, the protection that satire provides, despite being quite overarching, is not enough to save this title. What differentiates good game satire from Uriel's Chasm is that good game satire must convey that it has the potential to be good, but is intentionally made badly in attempt to pay homage to bad source material. Without the implementation of basic functions or a good system for the game to run on, the satire fails to parody its source and instead just becomes what it tries to mock. See AVGN Adventures and DLC Quest for examples of satire done right. The former parodied old-school platformers with brutal difficulty and the latter parodied modern microtransactions by making everything in-game DLC. However, both of these games have basic functionality and don't turn off players with awful aesthetics and unfair mechanics. If those two were designed the way Uriel's Chasm was made, then AVGN wouldn't have a jump button and DLC Quest would make players pay actual money for the fake in-game DLC. Because the developers do not understand how to effectively render satire in videogames, this game fails on all levels: as an actual game and, most importantly, as a parody.\n\nGood games and religious games are not mutually exculsive in theory, but this game does nothing to prove this theory correct. Adequate functionality in controlling the character does little to forestall the mass of horrible elements that this game forces players to endure, from the lack of simple components like a pause menu to no explanations of backstory to such an out-of-place shoehorning of Biblical passages in a game that otherwise has nothing to do with Christianity, that this game can only be described as unholy. Avoid this like the plague. Uriel's Chasm gets an F+.","January 1, 2015","false","1.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

There's no metaphysics here, and VERY little "rich context" that in NO WAY can be investigated.)\n\nI greatly enjoyed this game, but I would not reccomend it to most people. You have to have a very specific taste in these kinds of psychedelic games in order to appreciate it. Oh, and it takes 15-30 minutes to complete the game.\n\nUriel's Chasm is a very complex enigma. First off, I would like to say that there is no "Shovelware Queens" as the description would have you beleive. I wanted to see their playthrough, so I googled it and searched for around 4 hours, and literally nothing even mentioning them popped up. This game is not based off an unliscened bible game, this is a game entirely handmade, not a revamp of a game from the 90's.\n\nI would try to give this game a traditional review, but that is impossible. The appeal in Uriel's Chasm is not the gameplay. The appeal lies in something more abstract, perhaps the game's overall aethsetics. This game is more of a commentary on other things than a game in of it's self. This is a fancy way of saying, the gameplay basically sucks. The second level is a very well made side-scrolling bullet hell, but the first and third levels are tedious. Now, don't get me wrong, I greatly enjoyed each level, but not because of normal reasons. It is a lot like Sluggish Morss in how it is presented.\n\nThe enclusion of DMT is what made me buy this game, and what made me realize that this isn't a remake of a very old game. Why would someone trying to sell a christian game advertise DMT?\n\nThe best part about this game is the ending. I found the whole concept of this game to be extremely innovative, and I am excited to see more games like this.","September 14, 2014","true","14.3"," 32 of 53 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","32","53","0","0"

I really was hoping it was as bad as the reviews led me to believe! Oh well, I will do my bit to add to its infamous "Overwhelmingly Negative" aggregated review score. :)\n\nIt's a very short game about the dangers of blind faith in Christianity. I think.\n\nOr maybe the dangers of having faith so fragile that a mere bad 1990s video game could really upset a person. Perhaps.\n\nOr maybe it's about how ridiculous "soccer moms" and people in the media in the 1990s were, saying that playing video games (and/or listening to Heavy Metal music) could turn people to Satanism, or turn them into zombies, or create severe mental health problems, or nervous breakdowns, etc - whereas nowadays video games are even more widespread and as far as I know, the world did not become overrun with Satanists.\n\nOr maybe... maybe it is actually face value made by some people who find the idea of the depiction of An Angry God in a video game really really upsetting and disturbing.\n\nThe point is not clear. I guess it has at least given me something to think about.\n\nIt feels oddly like there was a lot of effort put into the artwork, the concepts, the scenes, and yet... everything also seems extremely limited. Like... there's some proper talent there but it's busy trying to get an idea across so it doesn't bother with the details, and just does the bare minimum for each piece and slaps them all together.\n\nI think playing the game isn't the point. I think playing the game was just the vehicle to getting something across.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure what that something was.\n\nFinished it in half an hour. It's not a hard game. Only one trading card dropped. Don't really feel it's worth sticking round any longer.\n\nI don't feel cheated at having bought this game at 90% off. I think 39p seems about right for this experience, whatever it was supposed to be.\n\nOne thing: I really wish this game had subtitles for the FMV bits. I know part of the aesthetic of the game would be broken, but the fellow near the end of the game, before the last boss, is far too quiet and muffled. Perhaps that is also part of "the point".

ET was regarded as the worst game of all time and gained a sort of cult status. It was so bad that Atari took the few hundred thousand copies of the game they had left and literally BURIED THEM IN THE DESERT! Yeah you heard me, they buried them in a landfill. There is even a new documentry about it. They didn't go out there trying to make the worst game ever, but they did.\n\nBecause this dev tried so hard to make this bad it just comes off as a concentrated mess of noise, flashing lights and nonsense medieval biblical quotes. Did he achieve what he set out to do? Sort of. Yes, it's one of the most hated games on steam. But to create something fundamentally broken and flawed and then claim it to be a masterpiece based solely on its' status as 'the worst game on steam' not only seems wrong, I'm worried it has inspired other devs to just fill the market with lazy crap like this.

No other game has reached the level of art that this game has. I salute Shovelware Queens for making this masterpiece. You play as spaceship girl, an awesome woman who moved to space. The Universe would never be the same. The gameplay is so fun that you would rather die than have this game taken away from you while playing. Once you beat the game at least one time, you will never stop playing. It's so addictive that weed and fapping will seem like a piece of crap in comparison. The graphics are astoundingly beautiful, pushing the PC hardware to the limit. I'm gonna be completely honest, when I saw a sprite of that weeb girl in the game, I legitimately thought that it was really a weeb girl! That's incredible! The dialogue is The Godfather tier. The story is very thought provoking, about what it means to be a christian, and I'm not going to give spoilers, as the game should be completely experienced alone and any twist should come as a surprise.. I can't explain anymore on why this game is an instant classic, go out and buy this game at least 20 or 30 times, however even that isn't enough to reward the developers, or artists as they should be called, for their work in creating the GREATEST game ever made on ANY platform.","December 29, 2014","false","1.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","0"

A common category with the greatest number of injuries is traumatic brain injury (TBI) following physical trauma or head injury from an outside source, and the term acquired brain injury (ABI) is used in appropriate circles to differentiate brain injuries occurring after birth from injury due to a disorder or congenital malady.\n\nIn general, brain damage refers to significant, undiscriminating trauma-induced damage, while neurotoxicity typically refers to selective, chemically-induced neuron damage."\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n\n"// Generated by Construct 2, the HTML5 game and app creator :: http://www.scirra.com" from c2runtime.js.\nI am sure, there out are good games created with Construct 2.

It's insultingly easy and just has you looking for bibles trapped in asteroids while a giant pair of teeth with skin wings spins around like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in an attempt to kill you.\n\nThe second level is actually decent, with good Sega Genesis-style music. It's a sidescrolling bullet hell shooter which kicks you back to the beginning of the level if you die. I really enjoyed this one, and actually started to get my hopes up for this game.\n\nThe third level curls into a ball, climbs up It's own ♥♥♥ and eats itself from the inside-out. Basic platformer which has you collecting crucifixes while the game slowly rotates anti-clockwise. Easy as ♥♥♥♥ and as boring as watching someone with freshly-amputated legs trying to crawl away from you to safety.\n\nThe forth level is another bullet hell level where a space giraffe shoots flashing eyeballs at you. It moves upwards every now and then to recharge Its eyeball attack, but quickly returns. It takes about 6 or 7 waves of this to kill it, which wouldn't be so bad, if there wasn't a constant looping track of pigs, women, and goats screaming in the background.\n\nConclusion: If you can't make good games, don't release them.","October 30, 2014","false","2.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I got this game for free and after playing it for 5 minutes I'm somehow already feeling cheated. Damn, I would feel less remorse by losing my wallet with all my things inside it somewhere.\n\nAs soon as you click "play" you're greeted by a footage of two morbidly obese girls talking (although I'm not sure what they were talking about, I was too busy pressing all the keys on my keyboard trying to skip the whole thing. Unfortunately, it's impossible). After the footage there's a small loading screen and then finally the game main menu (pressing Z is the only option, by the way).\n\nThe game starts with a filler unskippable "cutscene" (it's more like a two picture slideshow with a painfully slow narration over it) and after you wait through all that you're finally presented the real game: A clone of the game Asteroids where you have to grind for bible verses. You grind for a few bibles and then there's another "cutscene", just like the first one, but this time instead of playing a top down spaceship game, you have to play through a side scrolling level where you shoot crosses and twisted alien trees. Half of the enemies in this level are unkillable for some reason (your bullets just go through them without doing any damage).\n\nAnd that's all I could endure. After playing it for 15 minutes I simply left the game open for a few more minutes so I could get free cards.\n\nIn short, no matter what happens, DO NOT BUY IT.","October 31, 2014","false","1.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Just check out //N.P.P.D Rush// - The Milk of UltraViolet for a frame of reference before judging this.\n\nThat being said, this game is more of an enigma which is placed within a long lost ZX Spectrum cartridge that is then presented to you through a Sega CD game than anything else. It is a user experience rather than a game, one that you should revisit a few times and let it sink in. RailSlaveGames has created a world where every little detail is part of an intentionally obscure story which is up to the user to put it together. Nothing is just handed to you, and that’s the way it should be. More like a journey, Uriel’s Chasm is a trip. The gameplay is something you’re doing while you’re checking out the details and investigating the madness.\n\nLet me try to explain....\n\nIn the game portion, you play as Sister Tabitha who has travelled to the edge of space to find out what happened to the Orbital Monastery “Enoch’s Hope”, which seems to be in grasps of “Garden”... some kind of otherworldly beast. The first stage is you bolstering your faith (and your sanity) to encounter “Garden” and hopefully find survivors. The second stage is you making the journey and the third stage has you locating the survivors. Or what is left of them.\n\nThis is only half the story. The other half is the story of those playing this game.\n\nSee, you’re not the player… nor Sister Tabitha. You’re only an observer.\n\nWhat you’re watching is more akin to The Ring or The Blair Witch Project than any game you’ve played thusfar. The characters in the video sequences (including the trailer) have found some kind of lost or buried NES or ZX Spectrum cartridge. They’re confused and angry at the game. The developer himself calls the game “rubbish” during one of these sequences as it has no options screen and is confusing, just like the game you’re “playing”. However, they’re almost supernaturally compelled to continue to play the game. It keeps calling to them. By the end… well… that’s up to your interpretation.\n\nWhat’s nice is that the developer is also very open about this title and already has been addressing issues players have been having with it’s presentation and length. Much like //N.P.P.D Rush//, he’s going to continue to add, refine and deepen the experience. Check the forums occasionally, you’ll be glad you did.\n\n...and the music is FANTASTIC. It’s gritty and edgy at parts, while completely environmental and entrancing at others. The vocal tracks can best be described as “UK style Grunge-Goth & PostPunk”.\n\nUriel’s Chasm defies conventional logic, as any mindscrew should. Let the dark cartridge take you over.

On one of the far ends of the dial there was a station called "Network 1".  In the evenings it would show little more than bad B movies, randomly placed 90's music videos, and terribly dubbed 80's anime.  Plus, nearly all the commercials were advertizements for phone chat 1-900 numbers.  It was badly done and amateurish, but it was one of the most fun stations I've ever watched.  It felt raw and unregulated, like I was watching something made from an underground entertainment industry, never intended to be seen by the general public.  The kind of place where cult classics are born.  I couldn't help but enjoy it, simply because it felt so unrepentantly wild.  There is freedom in witnessing something that is not bound by the constraints of normal behavior, even if you aren't a part of it.\n\nUriel's Chasm reminded me very much of Network 1.  It's strange in a way that a VAST majority of the people who play it will not enjoy.  However, if you're able to appreciate the fact that this game includes a space nun who strapped a giant tank full of DMT to her back in order to rocket into another plane of reality, possibly even into the mind of God, then I would encourage you to play it.\n","January 26, 2015","true","1.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","1"

The kaleidoscopic savagery of the game's aesthetics will immediately entrance some players (I was one of those), but many will be so offended (perhaps without knowing why), that they will completely commit to despising Uriel's Chasm -- even missing the fact that it is not just a niche work of art, but a carefully polished item of software.  True, the game is not long, but all four of its worlds play with perfect smoothness.  Especially great are levels 2 and 4:  bite-sized chunks of frenetic BULLET HELL that will set the drums in your veins pounding!  Ah, that demonic presence in the final level!  I thought I could laugh at it during my second playthrough, but its discordant shrieks, its twisted visage -- they had me wearing a stiff coat of gooseflesh through the entire fight!\n\nRail Slave always puts great music into their games!  If spirit-punk and indie electronica are your bag, you should pick up some of the free music they've got floating around!\n\nLove the game or laugh at it -- your call -- but it deserves to be bought and played!  Uriel's Chasm and games like it are why I am in love with the wild and free new Steam.","March 28, 2015","true","2.0"," 24 of 43 people (56%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","56","24","43","6","0"

Harder than dark souls but still has a great story. You might think this is another one of those joke reviews. I'll admit it may not be worth the $5, but I would definitely pick it up for around 50% off if you're looking for a difficult game to play.\n\nAfter finally finishing the game after just over an hour of gameplay, I can say that it was pretty damn difficult. If you plan on playing this game, this is the difficulty of each level:\n\n1st: 2nd easiest overall, easy if you're conservative\n2nd: 2nd hardest overall, difficult no matter who you are. Asian Chuck Norris?  You're still ♥♥♥♥ed.\n3rd: Easiest overall. No talent or skill required whatsoever, the easiest platformer that ever existed.\n4th: Hardest thing ever.

I would NOT recommend this to someone who thinks that giving up a lunch at McDonald's in order to own a piece of performance/video game art dolled up (down?) to parody 90s unlicensed bible video games with an absolutely STELLAR soundtrack is a bummer idea.\n\n... But, if that sounds like something you'd be in the mood for and you like the idea of the weird meta joke the developer is playing on all of us, cancel the super size with fries, give the register jockey the finger and commit your five bucks to this instead.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/commonfilthradio/recommended/292630/","commonfilthradio","commonfilth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/commonfilthradio/","25 products in account","Seeing the description of the game and the overwhelming amount of negative reviews, I initially thought that Uriel's Chasm ticked off a bunch of edgy atheist teens who freak out at the mere mention of anything religious. Thankfully, the negativity had little to do with this, but I still was not satisfied with the actual reasons motivating the bad reviews. Upon reading a review which spoke highly of its religious themes, controls and similarity to games of the full motion video era, I decided to buy Uriel's Chasm at the price point of $0.49.\n\nAfter the first level, it became clear to me that Uriel's Chasm uses the fact that it's a game to create an experience unlike any I have ever had. The gameplay here is incredibly simple and easy to learn. Four out of the five keys used are for directional controls. The sole complication this game provides to the player is the fact that each level plays differently than the last. Any curveballs beyond this would interfere with what this game ultimately achieves.\n\nA menacing atmosphere inundates Uriel's Chasm and it intensifies with each level. I cannot wait to reach its conclusion. I never would have imagined that a tandem of the 2006 YouTube and 32-bit 2D game aesthetics could be used to such frightening effect. Play alone at night for the full experience.\n\nWith all of this in mind, this is not a game upon which you are going to spend 100 hours. In fact, it shouldn't take you any more than 2 hours to complete.

Unpacking it and trying to make sense of it all is likely a fools errand and then some but that doesn't matter. It's not often you get a videogame with this sort of conviction to being obtuse and veering this far into the leftfield.\n\nIt's an interesting curio, perhaps not one that you'd come back to, perhaps not even satisfying in itself but worth an idle look and some of your time?

Don't forget to scrape the bowl as you're doing this.\nMix in the sour cream till its incorporated well. Then, add the eggs one by one, mixing well after each addition.\nPour the batter into the springform and let it bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes After the baking time, turn off the oven and leave the door ajar.

The game begins I start the recording and already ♥♥♥♥ has hit the fan. The FPS is frozen outside the game box (There are 2 black bars either side of the actual game) so I have no idea if I'm recording. The game passes the 'Btw this game is absolute ♥♥♥♥' Intro cutscene still with glitched out black bars either side. Eventually I get it sorted (Not really I just took a gamble and hoped it was recording) and begin the game, the first level gameplay is simple, you fly around and shoot ♥♥♥♥ to get 'faith' meanwhile a giant....thing spins around, to get faith you either sit still and let it regen or you collect bibles from destroying astroids, also inside some astroids are ships that shoot the ♥♥♥♥ out of you. There is literally nothing to this level at all except ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bible quotes (Atleast I think they are quotes, for the most part they are grammatically incorrect such as 'an high priest'). It then goes on with another dumb ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cutscene that at this point I really couldn't give a ♥♥♥♥. It's now a side scrolling space shooter that starts off with you IMMEDIATELY DYING. I kid you not. After about a minute of this dumb broken side scrolling ♥♥♥♥ and noticing how AWFUL the hit detection is I flew around to find a spot on the map where I couldn't die and guess what, I found it, not only a place where you can't die but a ♥♥♥♥ing hole in the bottom of the map that you can fly through! The bullets literally go on forever and so do you. At this point I realised that I had not anticipated a boss battle due to not having one before and so when one appeared I had already gone to far down and left and now had no way of getting back or restarting the level so this is where my gaming session ended.\n\nThis game also lowered my IQ immensly so if I were you I would go and pick up Air Control instead, atleast that game actually worked and has some redeeming factors whereas this is just a mess of a game that shouldn't even be sold. This game should be buried like E.T.\n\n---Conclusion---\nThis game is ♥♥♥♥ -Genesis/10.","December 23, 2014","false","0.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

What you're about to purchase is a true masterpiece, I'm just going to go through the wonders of this game with a short list:\n\n* The Intro\nAs you're opening the game, you'll encounter this very well animated 3D video that gives you an almost 6D experience of two girls discussing the state of the world in a very exciting yet academic manner that makes you want to play this game immediately. You're met with a lot of dialogue that is crafted intelligently which in result makes you eager to continue playing this game. As your hands are shaking, let me go further into my review.\n\n* The graphics\nNow this is a wonder to itself. Don't you think some games are just too sharp and it's a little boring how you can identify every lamp from a donut? Well this game fixes this problem. As you're going through the mindblowing and visually stunning experience in this game, you're met with various times where you're simply asking yourself "So was that a space ship, or just a huge floating undefined pixel I just went by right there?" and there's more. When you reach the point a couple times in the game when you're dying there will be an explosion. Animations? Overrated. A yellow splur of pixel is enough to indicate what's going on and this game gets it! Who needs welldefined animations to explain what we already know?\n\n* The storyline\nThis game is actionpacked so much that I'ma have to write a novel on this. At first playthrough I was shedding a small tear as I was getting hit by a huge donut. Or well, an asteroid but as I wrote in the graphics part it's kinda hard to differ which makes this game so unique. You have to achieve faith before the garden erases you. Faith in what you might ask? Well, that's another part where this game is very ambigious in a mysterious and sexy way that is exactly enough to not make it seem pretentious and fake. Exactly where you're destined to, and what happens when you finally achieve more faith than the garden is a wonderful mystery too, as your spaceship will probably turn into a huge splur of yellow pixels before you reach the goal of this game, and the best part is that you will have no clue what happened as the donut, asteroid, and background fades into the background which in turn creates this wonderful visual masterpiece I already went through in the graphics section.\n\n* The music\nAh, my favourite part. This makes Mozart and Beethoven crumble in shame as the sounds are vastly comparable to the highlights of the four seasons but just a tad better than that. You'll find yourself in a personal peaceful space as you open the game and listen to the wonderful melodies that neither The Legend of Zelda or Super Mario's tunes in any sense can compare with.\n\n10/10 would buy again 3 times along with 7 copies for my friends. You will never regret this purchase.","January 23, 2015","true","1.2"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","53","8","15","7","0"

The music was akin to nails on chalkboards, the gameplay was all over the place and none of the different gameplay systems were implemented well (the gameplay changes between levels), the visuals are a confusing jumble of a hot mess, and whatever thin plot feels like something I might've come up with on a mild acid trip with some biblical quotes and references stapled onto it.\n\nThe short version?  You will NOPE the hardest you've ever NOPED and pray the horrid stink of this game does not stain your computer's memory after it's been erased.

What is there to say about this game that hasn't already been said? You play as Sister Tabatha, who I imagine is one of the ladies you see at the beginning of the game. Then you fly around in your ship that has a green ♥♥♥♥♥ pointing you to get the drugs, all the while this big red mouth flies around that if you come near, you die. You have to collect hotdogs and bible verses which display on the screen. You fly around collecting stuff and then you die and start again. The music is better than Skrillex at least. I would've put more time into it but my joint ran out and my dog had to go outside to pee, so I took care of that instead. It was fun while it lasted. A ship with a green ♥♥♥♥♥.

It captivates the mind and touches the soul.                                                                                                                                           Through the use of clever gameplay elements such as picking up Jesus being crucified, Uriel's Chasm grips its player right from the start.                                                                                                                                                                                                      Found footage is undeniably the best way to shoot a film, so Uriel's Chasm takes the technique and runs with it; having 90% of its cutscenes as webcam videos.                                                                                                                                                             Uriel's Chasm takes the player on a spiritual journey in which said player will make a startling realization and by the end of the game have a new perspective on life.

It captivates the mind and touches the soul.                                                                                                                                           Through the use of clever gameplay elements such as picking up Jesus being crucified, Uriel's Chasm grips its player right from the start.                                                                                                                                                                                                      Found footage is undeniably the best way to shoot a film, so Uriel's Chasm takes the technique and runs with it; having 90% of its cutscenes as webcam videos.                                                                                                                                                             Uriel's Chasm takes the player on a spiritual journey in which said player will make a startling realization and by the end of the game have a new perspective on life.

It's like looking at the bottom of your mcdonalds bag and finding extra chips, it just tops all games by a mile, from the story to the art it just really pulls the player in. Apart from the 5 minute introduction every time you load the game, this game is a fast paced, space adventure. The introduction really pulls you into the game and makes you feel a part of it, a smart idea by the game devs to include actual humans talking to you so you don't feel lonely,  becuase I mean, if you're buying this game, you're lonely. But all things said, this is the game of the year in my opinion and shouldn't be overlooked because it is 30p.

It's some kind of abomination. And i mean it.\n\nAnyway, I always try to give game a chance, and MAYBE I will try one more time with this thing but i can tell there is nothing that would convince me to recomend this trash to anyone. I mean really, i would rather be slave of this fat persons from the begining that talk someone into wasting money on this crap.\n\nIt is painfull to look at. Music is painfull too. I can bet that whole concept of this thing is to make something crappy and weird and hope that someone will think this is some kind of milestone for games or something like artsy experience. I don't know, I think devs decided to sell sh*t wrapped in shiny paper. Too bad even paper isn't shiny.\n\nAll reviews on store page are like "it's so unique, play it; it's great but no one can see it; it's different". Hmmm... well... the comunity has spoken, and as we know from recent Kotaku fun times, people who write this reviews mostly have some sexual desires and sometimes devs try to fullfill them.\n\nIf you didnt understand i said that this game is so bad that someone must have give head to reviewers for this kinda positive notes.\n\nAnyway, sorry for my english. I practically don't write reviews but this game is so bad i had to did this.\n","October 28, 2014","false","1.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

No, this game is an absolute masterpiece. The entire game can be finished in half an hour if you're any good at video games, and doing so is definitely worth the experience. This isn't a mere game, it's a journey. You will learn things about yourself that no other game will provide and come out the other end a completely different person than before, and for only $5 I don't think there is any other game out there that can provide the same value.

Looks normal enough: Some weird anime inspired shmup with Bible references shoehorned in so that it can be sold in Christian bookstores and bypass the console's licensing agreement.  However, it seems there's more to it than meets the eye, as the reviewers and their friend start displaying odd psychological symptoms.\n\nIn other words, it's a gaming creepypasta without the text.  As an original story, it avoids the fanfic element that has made video game pastas a punchline of late.  It's nowhere near as brilliant as its developer seems to think, but as a short horror story, it's alright.","November 16, 2014","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/osirissaline/recommended/292630/","osirissaline","Osiris Saline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/osirissaline/","697 products in account","I really enjoyed the first 20 minutes of my 25 minutes with Uriel's Chasm. The internal logic of being one of three people Let's Playing a game, the references to unlicensed and morally dubious bible games (that I've played in my youth), and the tampering with bad mixes, MDMA and acid moments...the game needs to be played by people who have experienced the jerky games with strobe effects in their youth, when cases for games had warning for epilepsy, which I'll discuss later on...\n\nNot watched on Youtube or Daily Motion or any similar site but played and experienced otherwise you will detest this. It purposely doesn't play well, you need to be in one the not-so-joke to take anything from it beyond it being a recreation of rubbish games with a lot of twists.\n\nFor the sake of not spoiling the game I will not go into any detail on how this admittedly short but purposeful game points you and your mind. Whilst the opening cutscene introducing us to two LPers may make you roll your eyes, stick with it, as you progress through the levels -and please do stick with them and beat them even if you get frustrated at first- you will see messages without context, seemingly unrepresentative but applicable logic, and the impact this has on those of us who come from religious backgrounds, whether it's faded in the past, or whether you stuck by them to this day.\n\nIf you read the above and want more details, invest, you'll be glad of it after 30 minutes. Or consider the following: what messages existed in video games when developed by the massively out of touch, or the unforgivably twisted who put forth the worst demands of papacy? This is STILL relevant in and out of religious video games as well. Games such as Hatred exist after all, where the dev team is linked to several Polish hate groups.\n\nUriel's Chasm sticks true to source material and as all the finer works of art -and all games are art- with a message it's relevant to the world around us right now.\n\nNow, the big bad point, the last boss -which covers up what sounds like Christian Snuff (my future-past ramble-punk project)- was too much. True to traditional crap unlicensed Christian games in gameplay terms but painful to try. Literally painful.\n\nIt actually gave me what I refer to as colour rays in my peripheral vision, where strobing and streaks/blotches of light not present in anything I am watching appear at the edge of my vision. I'll continue to describe this in a note at the end of the review just in case you have similar vision problems and should possibly avoid playing the game.*\n\nHOWEVER if you aren't the likes of us who gain migraines or have eye problems, and are one of us who remembers the late 80s/early to mid 90s bootleg religious games you may have accidentally played or been given by a particularly concerning horror movie fearing relative, you MUST play this.\n\n---------------\n\n*HEALTH NOTE: Whilst this may make you remember the old Megadrive/Genesis booklets mentioning epilepsy and vision problems, this isn't a problem with my eyesight that has never been undetected: I've been tested for different forms of epilepsy post-injuries to my eyes/one orbital bone/one eye socket means I have prism in my glasses to help out physical strain with both eyes focusing on exactly the right thing.\n\nHell, I was at my opticians & my GPs a week ago talking through how nothing had changed for the worse in recent history! And it's never bothered me in video games. Ever. In 21 years of playing (that's not my age for the record, I'm a fair few years older). So please, if you do have existing vision problems or have migraine problems you should consider your purchase carefully.\n\nI would still recommend it but I don't want someone reading this to trigger their own health issues!","October 19, 2014","true","1.8"," 18 of 38 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","18","38","0","0"

There is a fuel value that keep decreasing as you move and there is a laser value that shows you how much bullets you have. you will pass it once you get more faith (hp then the garden number).\n\nPS: there is also an arrow on the minimap show you where this space temple is ... it's huge and keep rotating do not touch it.. you loose faith in seconds as you touch it.\n\ntook me 10 miniutes to figure this ♥♥♥♥♥ out and i was able to proceed to level 2..\n\nlevel 2\nIt's just a gladius type platform shoot that you start with 3 health... i suck at this. It's very long with no check points. enemy's missle and bullet that cover up most of the screen at times.. and sometime you got hit and you got hit by 3 bullet at once and you instantly dies..\nI was doing really well in one of the attempt that went very very far with all my 3 health intact and got obligrated by a swam of bullets from this star looking alien ship...\n\nit seems got at least 3-4 more level that i cannot reach yet.\n\nI will continue play until i get my 3 cards then i will see if i should continue and finish it or not.\n\nThere are a lot hash comments for this game here and i feel it deserve a little bit better treatment than it should .. maybe 3/10 instead of other people's 1/10.\n\ni will recommend this game since there are several way people can get it for for free to just try it and laugh at it.

Why? Because it got given out free somewhere, so a bunch of people who wouldn't have even been interested in the first place grabbed it to add it to their "collection". It's actually a rather amazing game, although I can't say I understood all of it. It combines biblical themes with a bizarre meta plot told through recordings of people who "found" the game. The effect is not unlike Marble Hornets or similar works, although I wish it went a bit farther with it. The gameplay changes from section to section, though is usually a shooter of some kind - all of them were very fun, with the possible exception of the third one which was more of a simplistic platformer. Definitely give this game a try, although do note that it's somewhat short if you're fairly okay at bullet hell so you might want to get it on sale.","June 11, 2015","true","0.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I'm skeptical of the notion that games are art (I think Kojima was right when he said games are a service), but there's certainly unruly fodder for the argument here.\n\nAs noted in the copy, No-Wave scene musician/poet/whatever Jarboe does the in-game voice-over here. No-Wave music was notable for being deliberately abrasive, noisey and antagonistic, punk rock carried out to its logical extreme. Dare I say the music set out to be unlistenable. In the No-Wave documentary "Kill Your Idols" one musician who was pivotal in the scene admits that he rarely listens to this sort of music and spends most of his time listening to generic pop. I bring this up because Uriel's Chasm is a sort of "No-Wave Game" - it sets out to be un-fun, which gave me the strange feeling that the game was a joke on the part of the developer.\n\nMost of the game is structured as some sort of shmup, be it the first stage's mash up of Asteroids and the first Thunder force, the second level's side-scroller, or the Director's Cut-additional final boss stage's Invaders clone. From a gameplay standpoint the problem is none of them are very fun. The first stage require's you to fill up your "faith gage" by picking-up items dropped by destroyed asteroids, or just waiting, as the gauge slowly fills on its own. Guess which one I opted for? The second stage is the most playable, given the mercifully small hitbox your character has (hint: it's the cross on your sprite). The final stage is barely-playable given the headache inducing spray of bullets, which painfully flash white and black (I don't advise this game for anyone prone to seizures). It's worth mentioning that what I presume to be the end-boss (I gave up when my eyes ached and my head started throbbing) is scored to a track consisting of Jarboe's sampled grunts and screams over which plays her monotone free-verse poetry. It's easily the most unpleasant final boss I've ever had the mispleasure of playing, which wasn't aided by the ship's enormous hitbox.\n\nThat being said, the aesthetic angle of the game is interesting. The set-up is essentially that you're "playing" a clumsy "let's play" video (I realize that phrase is redundant), with non-"in-game" cutscenes consisting of the hosts commenting on the game, some of it being humourous, at least blackly-so. The game's certainly colourful, too, while the unlicensed head-trip bible game trappings keep things fresh. Light CRT and unlicensed-game-visual-glitchiness simulation is also a nice touch.\n\nThe real star of the game is its soundtrack. Simply put, it kicks ♥♥♥. Be it the second stage's homage to the Megadrive or the ♥♥♥♥♥in' shoegaze epilogue, the music at least keeps one part of this admittedly short game enjoyable.\n\nIt would be nice if it were possible to give this game a "mid" rating, given it fits what one reviewer said of the film Demon Seed. To paraphrase, it's definitely not a classic, and it can't be said that it's even any fun, but in the end players with the right frame of mind won't have wasted their forty minutes. Just don't torture yourself with that end boss. Life's too short.","October 9, 2014","true","1.8"," 15 of 34 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","15","34","0","0"

The developer is trying to say something about death, living, god, and faith which I don't have a clue what the hell he's talking about.\n\nAnyway, don't believe those funny reviews and try to pass the first round, then you will understand how to play the game and the insane difficulty, It's pretty starightforward to play afterwares, but there's no clue about what or how you should do, so be smart.","April 23","true","0.5"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astring/recommended/292630/","astring","every bae is halloween","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astring/","4250 products in account","Disclaimer: I was given my copy of this game by the developer(s?) for a review I wrote of their prior title. I enjoy their work. That said, this took me a few tries to finish.\n\nAt its core, this is a narrative-focused title. You've got two storylines running in parallel, that of your player character, and that of the people "playing" the game in real life. It's decidedly designed to bring up the era of pirate game design, where things are glitchy, frustrating, and sometimes literally painful to play. This is not a game I would call "fun". The final stage actually gave me a splitting headache but I refused to stop because there is no save function (the game can be beaten in about a half-hour or so, it makes sense).\n\nLike their prior title (NPPD Rush), this game received a post-launch patch adding new content and cleaning up some gripes people had with it. I played this after the Director's Cut patch, and so I already know some of the things on the store page/from my launch week failed attempt to beat the game were changed. Mostly it's for the better, although from the sound of it, the final painful stage was also one of these additions.\n\nDespite the criticism above, I'm still glad I played through this, as it's basically what you'd get by mixing a fever dream with WarioWare like "microgames", since each stage is short from start to finish. It's just on stages 2/4 you will probably die. A lot. It's a surreal narrative that's more focused on introducing some concepts that are slightly based upon interpretations of actual texts, rather than just being 1:1 translations. (Seriously. Google some of this. If you want a more coherent take on some of the same material, go find the console-only title El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron.)\n\nA tip from me to you: on stage one, blow up a few asteroids and then immediately beeline to the corner of the map to stay still after your Faith begins rising. You will complete the stage with a little patience and minimum harassment.","October 31, 2014","true","2.1"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

Three buttons: z, b, and d. Arrow keys move. No pause, no menu, no skipping the multiple intro videos. The game comes off as one big joke.\n\nGreat troll, 0/10.\n\nEDIT: I've played the game past the first level, and since my prior review addressed that and it seems to only apply to that level, I've deleted it. I still can't recommend this game. It's a bit clunky, it can be really hard, and feels cheap. I wasn't able to pass the second level, as it seems to require an incredible amount of patience. A single enemy can deplete all of your health in an instant, because each one fires 10+ projectiles at once, and if you're not in the right place, chances are it's going to hit you. There was a similar aspect in the first level, with asteroids flying at you and spawning ships, or the giant creature that takes up the majority of the map.\n\nThe game just isn't fun. Figuring out what you're supposed to do isn't terribly hard, but the execution is just miserable.

Arrow keys to move the spaceship in the first level. The game is very hard and has very weird design decisions (huge and flashy subtitles, creepy voice reading the text, no options, FMV that is not skippable, etc). This is certainly one of the weirdest games ever made, with different gameplay for each level.\n\nIn the first level, you control a ship and the goal is to gather more Faith than the Garden. This is acomplished by shooting stuff and getting Bible pages, which show you texts from the Bible. After a while, if you just avoid being damaged, the Faith level keeps going up until you finished the level.\n\nIn the second level, you play a 2D scrolling shooter with very low HP and you need to get to the end of the level without checkpoints, killing Crosses that shoot, among other enemies.\n\nI have not been able to finish the second level, and there is no saving system, so I'm not sure I'll feel like finish this weird and terrible game.

Arrow keys to move the spaceship in the first level. The game is very hard and has very weird design decisions (huge and flashy subtitles, creepy voice reading the text, no options, FMV that is not skippable, etc). This is certainly one of the weirdest games ever made, with different gameplay for each level.\n\nIn the first level, you control a ship and the goal is to gather more Faith than the Garden. This is acomplished by shooting stuff and getting Bible pages, which show you texts from the Bible. After a while, if you just avoid being damaged, the Faith level keeps going up until you finished the level.\n\nIn the second level, you play a 2D scrolling shooter with very low HP and you need to get to the end of the level without checkpoints, killing Crosses that shoot, among other enemies.\n\nI have not been able to finish the second level, and there is no saving system, so I'm not sure I'll feel like finish this weird and terrible game.

However it doesn't pretend that its not. The makers were trying to be weird so you'll find a lot of reviews from people that were put off by that. Also there's Bible references immediately and throughout, but its definitely not in a preachy, shove it down your throat type of way. Why such negative reviews for that I don't know. Many mainstream movies and games refer to the Bible. Anyone remember Halo?\nAnyways I wouldn't buy it but that's my opinion. I'm writing this review when the game is posted at 49 cents... 90% off until april 6. I still don't think I'd buy it, but it does have trading cards so maybe. It's retailed on Steam at $5 so if you like weird games and its peaked your interest try it out, it's not horrendous. I've played worse, much worse.\nThe maker did this game on a budget I'm sure so the fact that its gotten the small publicity that it has isn't bad. Maybe being weird was a good idea...\nSpace theme 8 bit top down starfighter craft. You're looking for some missing space station. I really don't want to bore you or me with the details.

Its so bad, its not even one of those games that you buy for your friend, Bad Rats is though. Ill compare this to Bad Rats. Bad Rats is a puzzle game that is actually playable and is actually decent. Its funny because of its bad grammar and cat deaths. Thats a game you should buy for your friends. This game barely even works. Its more expensive than Bad Rats. It tries to be a top down shooter, but fails so bad. I got a seziure from playing this, not even joking. All of the positive reviews of this game just talk about uninstalling it. IDK why its even on Steam. Just dont buy it ok. My friend got this for me. I now hate him, and i stay up at night thinking about why someone would even make this. If you are reading this, get the hell off of this page, close Steam, turn off your computer, smash it into a million pieces, burn it, and then finally doom it to the depths of hell. Thats what this game makes you do, its that bad. And if a friend ever gifts it to you, decline it, never talk to that friend again, and may god have mercy on your soul.","January 1, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/n2tz/recommended/292630/","n2tz","Hobo Stains","http://steamcommunity.com/id/n2tz/","153 products in account","Uriel's Chasm is a confusing game to say the least. It contains of 4 stages of different gameplay.\n\n1st Stage - Asteroid type game. You're in a spaceship and have to destroy meteors to find bible pages. You have to keep an eye on your fuel and ammo while avoiding a giant spinning monster roaming around aimlessly. Every time you get a page of the bible you'll get half a screen of text that you have no real time to read so I just left it there.\n\n2nd Stage - A sidescrolling bullethell shooter. The most confusing part about this was the hitboxes, sometimes it seems the  player's head is the hitbox, sometimes it's the entire body (when touching the ground). This part of the game was actually kind of fun since it was somewhat challenging.\n\n3rd Stage - 2D platforming, item collecting. So this time you're walking around, jumping from platform to platform, trying to find the crucified Jesus to hear some nonsensical text. On top of the lack of any real gameplay the screen is constantly spinning around, disorienting the player.\n\n4th Stage - Bullethell boss battle. You're fighting a boss who keeps shooting black and white circles at you. On a black background. So good luck dodging the bullets. Fortunatelly when you die the stage just resets so there's no waiting involved. After defeating the boss you get a screen saying "The End" and as far as I know that's the end of the game.\n\nPros:\n\n+ 2nd and 4th stage are challenging and somewhat fun\n+ Controlls are actually pretty okay\n\nCons:\n\n- Unskippable cutscenes that last around 90 seconds\n- Gameplay is all over the place. Some of the stages are challenging and fun while others are dull and boring\n- Repetitive music\n- Poor or no sound effects\n- No continuing after exiting the game\n\nIf you have any patience you can complete this game but it's not really worth it other than the trading cards.","April 7, 2015","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
