"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yij/recommended/268870/","yij","Yij","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yij/","391 products in account","Summary\nFree roam squad based RTS/RPG with a cyberpunk setting running in the classical veins of Syndicate. Start from the ground up with a weak squad and limited supplies, and slowly work your way up the food chain to take on the big corporations. Acquire a mass of guns and upgrades to help you accomplish your goals. Decide whether you want to use stealth, sheer firepower or a mix of both to complete your objectives and rise to the top.\n\nPlays a lot like Dawn of War II with a Blade Runner theme whilst being fresh and unique. Highly recommended!\n\nGraphics\nThe city is one of the best and most imaginative environments you'll witness in video games. Rain pours down onto the streets below, neon lights reflect in puddles, steam spews out of vents and manholes, elaborate architecture that portrays its own themes and back-stories varying from district to district. Crowds of civilians walking around going about their daily lives, unaware of the potential chaos about to erupt around them. Groups of soldiers patrol outside the surrounding bases, occasionally bullying unlucky NPCs.\nThis truly feels like a living breathing city hub and not just a simple tickbox for player immersion. There will be many times where you will simply stop all manner of violent activity and just scroll around the environment, admiring the sheer scope and beauty that this futuristic Blade Runner-esque playground has to offer.\n\nSound\nThe soundscape of the environment is top notch, with all the beeps and boops you can expect from a futuristic setting, some of which pay homage to the earlier Syndicate games. The ambient raindrops underlies all the sounds of NPCs chatting, cars driving past and other general background noises, creating an extremely immersive atmosphere that makes you feel like you are actually in the game.\nMusic wise, the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic and perfectly fits the game and settings. All the synthesised beats, drum bass and electronic keyboard motifs will make players have a sheer blast reminiscing cheesy music from the 80's era. Still, there’s only a few tracks available that grow repetitive over time.\n\nGameplay\nMissions follow a rigid structure, requiring you to gain access to a base and send a particular agent to steal some wares, and from then on it's pretty much up to you on how you want to accomplish it. You can always just blow open the front door, gun down everyone who gets in your way and be in and out within a few minutes... assuming you have the necessary firepower to do so.\nThe more strategic method would be to send in a lone agent to sneak past guards, steal the goods and sneak back out without anyone knowing you were there.\nOf course, if you're up to the challenge and can effectively utilise all different Agent's abilities on the fly, you can combine the two for maximum pleasure. For example...\n\nUse a mind-controlled civilian meatshield to pop of a few rounds causing the guards to open the gates, then send your Soldier in to cause a mass distraction. Have your Support guy refilling his ammo supplies whilst healing him at the same time. Meanwhile the enemy is so focused on concentrating their fire on this monster of a man, they failed to notice two shady characters slipping by unnoticed: the Hacker who is disabling security and opening locked doors for the Infiltrator who is making his way towards the heart of the base to swipe their tech data.\n\nIt's moments like this when you've mastered the game mechanics and everything clicks into place as your fingers fly over the hotkeys, you observe the controlled chaos with a steady hand but thumping heart, the insane 80s techno soundtrack harmoniously mixing with the sound of gunfire and explosions, that you realise “♥♥♥♥... no game in recent years has EVER come close to replicating what I'm feeling right now”. It's that same feeling you get when you finally do the freaky-deaky with your first love, after all those expensive chocolates and soppy love cards everything finally makes sense, and it's just ♥♥♥♥in' beautiful.\n\nRPG mechanics\nSatellite Reign is a cruel mistress that will punish you for being sloppy: succeed however and you will be rewarded, if ever so slightly. Early on, your Agents bear nothing more than a puny pistol and SMG, so you are expected to tackle missions and enemies in an effort to gain Experience Points. XP can then be allocated to each individual Agent and mould them how you see fit: If you want your Infiltrator to concentrate more on long range attacks, or rather devastating close combat abilities than it's your choice.\n\nThe firearms are well balanced and diverse: ballistic arms are a good middle ground, whilst lasers excel against enemies welding shields, whilst plasma is best used for melting away heavily armoured foes. Machineguns are good for general purpose assault, shotguns for flanking tough individuals, plus sniper rifles for assassinating far away targets. Then you got your miniguns and rocket launchers to, you know, ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up.\n\nYou can also acquire a great number of upgrades to further enhance your capabilities, such as artificial eyes to improve your accuracy, or synthetic limbs to help you carry heavy weaponry. Likewise, you can unlock some great pieces of kit: in addition to silencers, grenades and first aid kits, you can enlist the use of attack drones or mobile deployment option.\n\nThe sense of progression is really strong, as the initial soldiers that once wiped you out in the early stages of the game become nothing more than annoying fleas that are easily crushed later on. It's so satisfying to view out your squad, decked out in energy shields and massive glowing plasma rifles ready to take on the best the city has to throw at you.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe game can get repetitive during later stages and the Unity engine is far from optimised. There currently is no drivable vehicles or multiplayer, with that been added in the future by the devs.\n\nLet's also not forget how great the game is, but how great the developers behind the game are: 5 Live Studios. They've been absolutely fantastic in handling Early Access Kickstarter, and it should set a standard for every other game developer out there, hands down. There’s so many unprofessional Indie groups out there enforcing a now negative stereotype, you need to give a round of applause to the few good ones out there in this polluted cesspit of Early Access generation.\n\n5 Live Studios have been getting directly involved with their community, asking questions and responding to enquiries, even engaging in friendly banter and trolling the trolls, plus acknowledging mistakes and setbacks. 5 Lives Studios doesn't feel like a corporate game company who only care about making sales, they come across as very organic developers who genuinely care about the game they want to make for themselves and for their fans. How many other game companies out there are like these blokes??\n\nIf I could explain it any better, it's like customer support. Instead of automated messages and getting a human response 10 days later asking you to disconnect and reconnect your wireless ethernet cable, reformat your hard drive and making sure your computer is turned on, 5 Live Studios are the guys that will personally talk to you to find the root of the problem, get back to you on the progress and making sure you are satisfied as a result. In the words of Disky “i r fix it n stuff.”\nThese are the guys that you'd genuinely feel like you'd talk to them in real life and give them a beer for just generally being a fellow human being.\n\nIn short, get Satellite Reign and enjoy everything it has to offer. Not only is it a throwback to the classic Syndicate series from 20 years ago, I guarantee it's unique and refreshing gameplay is nothing like anything you have experienced on today’s market.","August 28, 2015","true","57.6"," 555 of 583 people (95%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","95","555","583","25","21"

If your soldier can't hardwire so good, just mindjack a civillian and let him have a go at it, even if he zaps himself into the afterlife the generator will probably shut down at least for a little while. Agents can be outfitted with gear and augmentations that let them acquire abilities across classes. Can't sneak a hacker to the right terminal? Slap a Proxy Hacker on the Thief and let him borrow the Hacker's skills. Support need a little more firepower? Cram a Drone Control chip into his brain and let him borrow the Hacker's drone. Need a soldier to hardwire something without being seen? Give him a Stealth Generator Module and let him borrow the Thief's invisibility for a little while.\n\nThe last tiers of each class' abilities are usually pretty significant and lend bonuses to the entire team. For instance, the last tier of the Thief's invisibility reduces the energy drain of his squad's cloaking modules, letting them stay invisible for longer.\n\nAlso, the lack of an active pause is pretty insignificant as the Support's Team Stims ability will slow down time to 10% of regular speed while boosting agent movement speed, cooldowns, accuracy and damage above even regular levels and lasts for absolutely ages.\n\nI'm not really one for indepth technical analysis of how stuff works, but other reviewers will cover that without a doubt.\nThe long and short of it is that the game is a solid and fun experience even for those that never played Syndicate.","August 28, 2015","true","18.5"," 189 of 207 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","189","207","3","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197973269730/recommended/268870/","76561197973269730","Nightfire","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197973269730/","135 products in account","Satellite Reign is the spiritual successor to the classic cyberpunk game, Syndicate. Fans have waited nearly a decade for this (including myself), but now that it's finally here, I find myself a bit... Underwhelmed.\n\nPerhaps this is because Satellite Reign feels and plays almost exactly the same as Syndicate did, except with a facelift and some small additions.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Syndicate was a great game, but let's keep in mind that it was released back in 1993 and we know a lot more about what makes a game fun now than we did back then. Syndicate was more acclaimed for its fearless aesthetic and premise than its clunky gameplay, and Satellite Reign appears to have decided to adopt the same exact same formula. In some ways, this game feels like it was made in a vacuum, where recent conventions in gaming have been deliberately ignored.\n\nFor instance, this game really needs a pause feature. It is always in real-time and you control four characters at once, which means that it's not always easy to keep track of everything that's happening to them. This game needs a way to be able to stop the action while still being able to issue commands. Without this, ordering your agents around while they're getting shot at from three or four angles can become extremely hectic and frustrating. This was probably the biggest problem with Syndicate, and no effort has been made to change this fact in Satellite Reign.\n\nThis is made worse by the fact that your agents are as dumb as a sack of bricks. They literally will not do anything unless you tell them directly. Even if they're being fired upon, they won't return fire unless you specifically tell them to; once their target is dead, they won't target anything else until you tell them to target the next one. And even if they can't properly attack their target because their line of sight is blocked, they'll continue to fire anyway, wasting their ammo, despite the fact that their shots are clearly hitting the wall.\n\nThis game needs smarter agents, and it could also use toggleable AI states. For example, a setting that switches your agents to "aggressive" mode, to make them attack any enemy in sight; a "defensive" mode to make them return fire when fired upon, and a "passive" mode to ensure they take no actions for when you want them to run away or conserve ammo. Plenty of other games have features like this, and it would seem like a no-brainer to include them in Satellite Reign, but this game has nothing of the sort. It forces you to micromanage everything, and you must do it entirely in real-time.\n\nSo what do you do in this game? Basically you sneak around and shoot people. This would not be a problem if these two aspects were well implemented, but unfortunately they aren't. The stealth mechanics are twitchy and unforgiving, and the combat simply isn't fun. Mostly you will find yourself trying to sneak around, only to fail due to your agents' inability to route the simple paths you've told them to go. Then, when you are discovered by the enemies and forced to fight, you will try to find good cover spots and sequentially click on enemies until they're dead. Then you will have to run away, because if you don't, this game will spawn an infinite amount of enemies at you until you're out of ammo and completely overwhelmed. So you run, hide, and wait. Once the heat is off you, you attempt to sneak around again, but you fail because the game is glitchy, and so you get drawn into another tedious conflict, and on and on it goes.\n\nIn addition, the "open world" this game advertises is a bit misleading; it should really just read as "persistent world". The game is essentially one huge map that you can roam to your heart's content, but there isn't much to do in it. You can hack ATM's and kidnap people to harvest their genes, but that's about it. This game is all about the missions, as Syndicate was, which begs the question as to why an open world was necessary for Satellite Reign in the first place.\n\nI mean, sure, you CAN go on a murderous rampage and slaughter civilians if you want to (and that was half the joy of Syndicate), but doing so doesn't really benefit you in any way. The only way to gain money in this game is to wait for your ATM hacks to slowly fill your coffers, and the only way to get new weapons is to steal prototypes, which are only given to you by completing missions anyways. Deciding to shooting up a bunch of cops or security guards will only yield you ammo to replace what you lost during the fight, and nothing more.\n\nSo what is good about this game? Well, for one thing, it features an absolutely amazing soundtrack by Protector 101 and Russell Shaw, whose retro-synth scores perfectly match the game's cyberpunk theme.\n\nFor another, the game looks visually stunning in absolutely every respect. The city is a beautiful, vibrant setting packed with clever hand-crafted details. No two streets are alike, and this is quite a feat unto itself. It's easily one of the best looking games I've played in recent memory.\n\nBut unfortunately, this is not enough to make the game feel complete, nor is it enough to make it fun. This game is "all style and no substance". I'm hoping that future updates will round out the game a bit more, but now that it's out of early access, I'm not going to hold my breath.\n\nI'm glad that I didn't pay full price for this game. If you're a die-hard Syndicate fan you will probably be satisfied with it, but everyone else might want to keep their distance.\n\nEDIT: As of the September 4th update, new players now have the option to start a new game with the "team stims" skill already unlocked, allowing the player to slow time at will (without having to grind for 10 hours or more to acquire the fully upgraded skill as normal). While this is good news for new players, it still isn't a proper "pause" feature like the game really needs - it drains your support agent's energy and won't work if he's dead. Still, it's better than nothing.","August 31, 2015","false","56.8"," 601 of 798 people (75%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","75","601","798","18","35"

I also understand, that now Satellite Reign is in pre-alpha condition, so I'm going to comment some moments of this game. It would be nice, if developers will read it.\n\nI would like to see in this game:\n\n1) First of all, co-op multiplayer. It's very important. More mods of the game: survival, hunt (when you fight against agents of other syndicates), etc.\n\n2) More interactive info on the screen. More info about world and objects (cyber-look, like in Syndicate FPS). It's cyberpunk or not? :)\nAnd (its important too) more combat info: range of weapons, capabilities of your enemies and other.\n\n3) Augmentations of your opponents: NPC-s has different augmentations too. You can hack or jam it (like in E.Y.E. - Divine Cybermacy game for examle).\n\n4) More loot. Now you can take only weapon of your dead enemy. Why you can't take his implants or internal organs to sell it on the black market?\n\n5) Why you can't direct auto-actions of your agents? To hold his fire, for example, or going to free fire, when he saw the enemy? To hold positions or attack?\nThis options are necessary for all tactical games, I think.\n\n6) More abilities to manipulate items, realized by drop-down menu, for example.\n\n7) An ability for player to change the set of agents (and hire two soldiers for the mission, it may change the style of playing and game tactics).\n\n8) The system of punishments. Now you can kill the enemy and wait their response actions in the shelter, where they can't find you.\nAnd how about the waves of enemy reinforcements and total interception of your agents?\nFor example, you can't kill somebody right on the street in real life without any problems - cops will try to find and arrest you for a long time.\n\nThats all. I hope, my comments are helpful for dear developers. I wish you will create really great game.","December 27, 2014","true","3.2"," 77 of 87 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","77","87","2","2"

This will eventually become a lengthy review which will go over many aspects and features that the game has to offer. Please be aware that this review currently only covers a few things that this game currently has to offer.\n\nFirst of all, let's start off with the graphics. The graphics on this game are very nice; everything is smooth, shiny, and the shaders and lighting are candy to the eye (even on the lowest settings). The special effects are also nothing short of awesome: The explosions look beautiful and the gunshots are also pretty neat. The amount of detail put into the graphical asepct of this game is nothing short of magnificent\n\nNow as for the game play elements, i'll start off with the strategic and tactical elements that this game has to offer when in combat. The strategic and tactical elements in this game are pretty nifty. Being able to place my agents in positions where you need them and having them do their roles (sniper, assault, support) according to how I wanted them to do it and watching it play out in battle (In real time as well) was a pretty satisfying feeling (something that I haven't experienced in any other game). The way a person can approach things in so many different ways is awesome; and with the variety of weapons and upgrades that you can get, the possibilities expand and will continue to expand with future additions. For example, you can go snipers only and take out the enemies within a base with long range, or you can go guns blazing: equip all your agents with assault rifles and blast through the enemies. Or you combine both and have 2 agents on the ground aggroing while you have 2 snipers on the rooftops taking out enemies from long range. Of course there are other options but that's just to explain a couple of them.\n\nHowever, when it comes to combat, keep in mind that the AI itself is is a bit meh when it comes to path finding issues and other things (although the foundations for a good AI are certainly visible and this is early access so it will become much better) But I must admit that I had a bunch of fun laughing my ♥♥♥ off merely watching the AI move, shoot, and try to find cover positions. However, despite the current issues with the AI, it is still very challenging, very aggressive, and it will kill you if you are careless. Should you aggravate the enemy enough they'll start sending units that are extremely powerful (e.g. a hovercraft that shoots lazers and a commander unit with a shield that coordinates the enemies)\n\nThe size of the world is pretty large (and extremely detailed), and what you can currently play in is only about 25% of what the full map will be.You can also take cars and drive them around the city; although you are restricted to the roads only and can't run over people (currently anyways) Additionally, you can obtain a skill that allows you to hijack a civilian and control it (and when the skill is leveled up enough, you can even hijack enemies), how cool is that? You can use these hijacked civilians for several purposes; I normally use them to scout out police/military zones and take out any security camers that I can without having to put my agents at risk.\n\nAnyways, to conclude this fairly simple review, i'll just say that the hours i've playing this game are certainly some of the greatest hours I've had in a game. The game is looking and feeling great so far and I do especially recommend this game to all you peeps who love strategic and tactical gameplay, but only if you're willing to put up with some bugs for some time.\n\nI will continue to edit this review with more info as I play more and as the game updates.\n\nP.S. The soundtrack is also a pleasure to listen to","December 11, 2014","true","20.6"," 86 of 102 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","86","102","4","0"

Add augmentations, gear/gadgets, weapons, weapon attachments, skill trees\n\n- players must keep a fresh clone supply available for respawning their characters after dying. Each respawn degrades the clone's attributes, and new clones must be used so the team doesn't atrophy\n\n- research and development system. Find a prototype weapon/gadget, and choose between using it in the field and potentially losing it, or sending it to R&D to eventually mass produce it\n\n- R&D requires researchers which must be recruited from the city. Outsourcing is available but costs a lot more to finish the project\n\n- skill trees enable multiple strategies, i.e. your infiltrator can spec for cloaking and thievery or raw sniping damage and close quarters melee stealth killing with a katana.\nInfiltrate facilities either by hacking the doors (using the hacking skill tree), or using your soldier's hardwiring skill to overload the door's power and trip it open. Security cameras can be hacked to turn off for a certain time, or just disable the power generator to a section of a facility\n\n- open world game play with a mission system. The main story has a mission chain, but each sector of the city has it's own set of missions that are indepedent of each other, and completely optional. More missions can be found hacking data centers spread throughout the city.\nMissions can be done either through stealth or brute force (harder)\n\n- mission briefings are enhanced with bribing and tips. Optional to spend cash for intel on missions, i.e. weak security at a specific entrance of a facility or acquiring keys to pass a security door\n\n- you can hack ATM's to give your team and income stream. You can also rob the central bank for each sector. Send the hacker in to increase the ATM income rate, or send the soldier to just smash and grab for a large lump sum payout\n\nThe not so good:\n\n- no meaningful character customization. You must "shop" for clones to change your appearance, meaning you cruise the city and "hack" a citizen's brain to send him to the cloning vats if you like how he looks. That character model is applied to your agents when they respawn or immediately if you choose\n\n- camera can't rotate 360 dgrees, only about 45 degrees or so\n\n- swapping weapons always pulls them out at the same time, meaning if you want to switch from SMG to your pistol, you pull the guns out and everyone runs away screaming / police start shooting you for having exposed weapons. Swap weapons in secluded areas only\n\n- slightly buggy, but from reading past reviews this has improved with each new build\n\n","August 16, 2015","true","48.6"," 53 of 59 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","53","59","0","0"

This game is no exception but be warned - it's very early in development!\nVerdict - 7.6/10Very Early in Development - DO NOT PURCHASE UNLESS FULLY COMMITTED!\nScroll to the bottom for an Overall\n\n\n\n\nCombat - 9/10:\nYou get four squaddies - all a different class with different abilities and skills; which you can level up to increase their efficiency. The Soldier is basically the tank with abilities such as 'Draw Fire' which as you can probably guess; is a taunt, the Support who specialises in healing and scanning the area, the Hacker who basically interacts with the environment hacking doors and cameras, and the Infiltrator who gets abilities like Cloaking and Assassination - they all have a Health and Energy which they regenerate slowly if they aren't either being attacked (Health) or currently using it (Energy). The actual combat itself is pretty standard, you can instruct your squad to use cover which they can shoot over and use for defense with are a few guns to pick from like Pistols, SMGs and Snipers plus a few futuristic weapons added in the mix. However, from my experience it seems that avoiding combat is generally the best situation, the game has a high emphasis on Stealth with the hacking, cloaking, and the vision mechanics from the guards and the cameras. The Stealth works really well especially with the electronic grid and hacking, the direct combat on the other hand works fine, but it's too simple which just makes it a lousy and half-arsed effort.\n\n\nLevel Design - 8/10:\nThe level design is great! It's set in an Open World environment where you can pretty much go anywhere you like, the world is set up into Districts with places of interest that you have to infiltrate and gain information and rewards in the form of quests. The places themselves are rigged up with Guards, Cameras and Doors which are connected to an electronic grid with control points that you can hack to gain control over them - except the Guards of course. The support can scan the area to see which control point links up to what piece of equipment which you can hack with the hacker, it leads to fun situations where you have to guide your hacker in undetected to turn off the facilities camera systems to allow the rest of your team to waltz in and pew pew everywhere. The Level Design is great and I really love how the world connects up. I can't help but feel that it's a bit too easy at the moment though and the facilities aren't exactly stealth puzzles to say the least... We can't rule this out though as the levels may get harder as more content is created.\n\n\nStory - 6/10:\nThere's not much to say about the story, as far as I've progressed in the game there barely is one. The story only goes as far as the quests which in turn have no real reasoning behind why you're doing them and they seem to make you look like the bad guys in all of this - you rob a bank for no reason other than money from what I've gathered! The quests do come with a short paragraph explaining things but just feels fragmented with bits and pieces all over the place, most likely due to the fact that you can choose which quest you do when; which doesn't leave much room for story. It's still Early in Development though so a main quest-line may be in the works or at least planned.\n\n\nGraphics - 8/10:\nThe graphics are extremely well made and really fit in with the whole atmosphere of the game - I have no idea what engine they have used but it looks great! It's set in a not-so-distant future with Hover Cars flying down the road and people walking on the street, it's actually possible to get your team into a car and drive them around the districts as well! Overall, the world feels alive and they've clearly put a lot of work into creating it. Unfortunately my sub-par PC only runs it at a solid ~23 FPS, consider this before purchasing.\n\n\nAudio - 7/10:\nThere's some nice 'Sci-Fi style' music playing in the background with a great ambience behind it. The game sound however isn't anything special, some sounds are good but others are just there because they need to be; they just don't really add anything to the atmosphere of the game which is a shame.\n\n\n\nOverall - 7.6/10:\nThey are asking for quite a bit of money for Early Access, and in it's current state it makes it extremely hard to recommend as a lot of content is missing from the game. For those that a extremely interested in the game; may like to note that it has huge potential and looks to be very promising - it's just the price is too extortionate at the moment. Like all Early Access games; you should remember to take it with a pinch of salt.\n\n\n\nLink to my YouTube Channel.\nLink to my Twitter Page.\n{LINK REMOVED} Link to my Blog.\nLink to my Curations.","May 4, 2015","true","4.9"," 71 of 89 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","71","89","4","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DanGraf/recommended/268870/","DanGraf","DanGraf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DanGraf/","161 products in account","Looking for a sequel to Syndicate Wars?Unsure whether this is for you?\nIt's a very tough call.\nA bullet-point comparative breakdown.\nSatellite Reign is the best revival yet seen of its predecessor. At about 30hrs in to the final release I am enjoying it, despite it leaving me wanting.  Aside from this game's amazing visuals - which are indeed damn near perfect, the biggest differences between this game and Syndicate are in its comprisal of main gameplay mechanics.\nIs Satellite Reign better? ... Personally I feel SyndWars is still the better game for its time, for the following reasons.\n\n- Stealth\nDid the game need this? The original Syndicate had a very basic system to discourage going in guns-blazing and it worked brilliantly... This game attempts a metal-gear-esque level of stealth gameplay and somewhat pulls it off, although at times it feels the balance of difficulty is thrown out the window when due to unpredictable AI pathing, the density/timing/loadout of enemy patrols within a single location can vary greatly between 'cakewalk' and 'impossible'.\n\n- Cover\nCombat is a fiddly, nitty-gritty affair with a focus on cover / flanking, energy/health regen and careful use of special abilities / cooldowns. All too often it feels clunky and unresponsive when your agents take cover in the wrong positions, ignore vital targets and shoot straight into walls despite appearing to have good line-of-sight. With the Stealth/Hacking gameplay being more stable, it often feels like Combat, which could have been super satisfying a'la Syndicate Wars, is to be avoided.\n\n- Hacking\nBam! This is where the game shines. In every way the world, gameplay and entire theme of the game feels more cyberpunk because of it's brilliantly designed and executed hacking mechanics. Satellite Reign far surpasses Syndicate Wars in this respect. Nice Job, 5Lives!\n\n- Open World\nFreedom to roam between location-based missions with unbroken continuity. The game never presents you with "mission start / mission failed / mission complete".  Instead you're just always looking down from above, with or without your agents. Tackle missions any time you happen to be in the area.  Infiltrate / die / respawn / die again in the course of attempting a single mission.  Lose interest mid-mission and try an entirely different objective at the drop of a hat. Sounds better? I reckon it sucks ♥♥♥, because gameplay lacks any meaningful context. There's basically no 'sandbox' style side activities to enjoy, so why make this game open-world at all?  All things in the city are ever-present and nothing ever changes besides unlocking new areas...\n\n- Immersion\nSadly, this is where the game breaks for me despite all the awesome visuals and atmosphere. You are given no identity, no home / territory or ideology worth fighting for, and ultimately no sense of impact on the world.  No meaningful factions or ideologies are represented.  No interesting characters make appearances or getaways - all are just generic NPCs with random names in repetitive mission logs. The beautiful sprawling city is hollow, filled with an array of soulless robotic puppets, and who the hell are you? Nobody. Boring.\n\nThis more than anything else destroys any sense of the game's STORY.   Because your agents feel instantly disposable/replacable - you never grow attached or feel the need to keep them safe. Because there is no authored flow of time or directed sequences of attention - you feel adrift in a sandbox with no indication of what's meaningful or why you're fighting the corporate oppressors. The lack of effort here totally rips me out of what could have been a super compelling experience. The game is purely mechanical, and the gameworld purely functional. Believe it or not, this is something Syndicate Wars did far better, over a decade ago. (remember Eurocorp vs The Church of the New Epoch? Awesome!)\n\nCome on 5 Lives Studios! There is great potential here to explore cyberpunk themed stories, but in avoiding the issue entirely this game feels rushed to create quantity-over-quality. I would trade one entire city district worth of gameplay for a half-decent story in this game. I hope 5 Lives Studios will carry forward and embellish this game's story - breathe some life into it's characters - make me *care* about my agents, our cause, the citizens, or the city/world we're fighting for. Beyond the obligatory surface of neon grunge, the most important ingredient of Cyberpunk is human stories, and this game don't got em.\n- Structured Gameplay\nBack then - with Syndicate Wars - each mission had an introduction/planning phase, hard-limited mission areas and extraction points, and clear Success/Fail conditions with side-objectives. This meant that new and inexperienced players could learn to enjoy the game's complex systems one step at a time, starting with the basics - never feeling overwhelmed, but rather drip-fed awesome new challenges and surprises along the way as the game's story progressed alongside it.\n\nAnd now - in Satellite Reign's case, There are a LOT of very cool gadgets, augmentations, skills and upgrades to unlock and combine for awesomeness. BUT it feels like the designer spits out a quick tutorial and dumps you in the deep end, saying "Duh - I know how all this stuff works - just read my mind, explore my incredibly complex hud + menus, read all the text, learn the keyboard shortcuts and figure it out, noob!" Not since the early days of Microsoft Flight Simulator has a developer packed so much hidden complexity into their game and expected players to master it on their own. In this case you're given way too much rope and left to hang yourself. Freedom to explore is one thing. Lazy-♥♥♥ game design is another - maybe not the best call.\n\nAll in all, worth playing if you're willing to stick it out, but this game falls short of greatness - inaccessible to many who might've otherwise learned to love it - for the above reasons.\n\nIf you're pumped up wanting a true Syndicate Wars successor, depending on what you loved about the original you may well be disappointed.\n\nDespite my misgivings I am giving this game thumbs up because in the context of kickstarter / early access indie games this leads the way! - a decent game delivered as promised in a timely manner. That is never easy to do. 5 Lives Studios are AAA-grade professionals deserving of every chance to continue improving their craft.","September 26, 2015","true","67.8"," 45 of 53 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","45","53","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mefiras/recommended/268870/","mefiras","Mefiras","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mefiras/","217 products in account","I was very excited about this game. It pains me to admit that it's not good. Here are my points:\n1. Save system is ridiculous. The fact that you can't save in red zone is stupid. Some missions take more than an hour to go in and out. If you fail in the very end - welcome to the load game screen and start your mission from the very beginning.\n2. All missions are stealth-only (at least in the beginning). It's impossible to go in force because your enemies are unlimited. They will keep coming no matter how many you kill. And stealth systems in this game are extremely limited and annoying. You can't be 100% sure if the enemy is going to see you or not. There is no cone of vision. Even cameras have weird vision, where sometimes they can see you when you stand under them, sometimes they don't.\n3. Every mission you do is essential a mission with some kind of a time limit. Because all the hacks of doors/cameras are limited in timed. That in combination with poor stealth implementation and inability to save makes the game frustratingly hard (and there is no difficulty setting).\n4. AI is very poor. They fight like simpletons. Hiding behind the first obstacle they can see. If I just rush and flank them, they will keep shooting from flanked position not trying to flee. Forget about them trying to flank you or pull any kind of semi-intelligent manoeuvre, not in this game. Sometimes enemy patrol will just stuck walking in circles in one area that you need to get through. You have to just sit in your cover and wait 2-3 minutes until they decided to move on.\n5. Not sure why this game has been made multi-leveled. You get no tactical advantage by being above your enemy. I've once tried to use my infiltrator to shoot enemy patrol with a silenced sniper rifle from the wall above. He just ran to the lift and decided it's much better to do it from the same level where the enemy is.\n6. The story in this game is non-existent. You get some brief introduction in the very beginning about big evil corporation that you need to take down and that's it. There is no motivation for you to do any missions. No real story behind them. It's just a puzzle. You go into red zone, you reach the marked door hiding (and failing) behind obstacles, you get money/agent/prototype by walking through the door, you stealth back outside. Why did I do that? I don't know... I just have this list of missions and icons on my map. Player has to find ways to entertain himself in this world. And there is really not many options. It's not a big openworld game like Far Cry. All the missions are the same.\n\nI can also mention absolutely stupid tutorial that teaches you how to click your mouse and scroll screen, but doesn't give you enough information about what's that cloning ability that your hacker has etc... etc...\n\nAll in all, this game is very mediocre. It brings absolutely nothing new or interesting to the genre. I will probably continue playing for a while, because I absolutely love cyberpunk setting, but I wouldn't recommend buying it in it's current state.","August 30, 2015","false","8.4"," 128 of 187 people (68%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","68","128","187","5","2"

You just found the best cyberpunk game released in years, and the only insometric strategic shooter released in... more years. This is early access done right - the game has kept to a strict time table, updates are regular and frequent, developers release feedback and talk to the community weekly, if not daily, and the full release is just around the corner. Not stuck in limbo, not gestating or waiting for more funding - these guys have taken their kickstarter gains, put them to good use, and listened to community feedback extensively.\n\nAs for the game itself, it isn't difficult to understand. Lead a team of 4 agents on a quest to save a dystopian world... or are you taking it over for your own gains? Either way, there is nothing happy or uplifting to be found here. Life is cheap, upgrades are satisfying, strategy is important and the game as a whole is very, very rewarding. The spiritual successor to Syndicate has arrived. The fact that it was made by just 5 guys? It feels like a triumph.\n\nUPDATE- V1.02: The full game is out, first patch is up... how is the finished game? Let's go through it in more detail.\n\nFirst off, I'm running the game on a GTX 960 4gb, i5 4690k (oc at about 3.8 ghz), 8 GB of DDR3 RAM, @ 1080p. I am able to roll through at max settings with the frame rate never dipping below 38 FPS. 38 sounds low to some of you - but keep in mind, this isn't a twitch shooter here. 60+ FPS is not needed for enjoyment. Also, some of the more advanced settings can be disabled for better frames.\n\nWith that out of the way, the game is still excellent. I feel as if some of the negative reviews are the end result of people not knowing what they were getting into when they purchased. The game features 4 unique classes, doing missions as you see fit in an open world environment. Some things to get out of the way right up front:\n\nCharacter's visual customization is limited (you will literally sleeve new bodies as the game goes on... the meat is expendable, the actual agent is downloaded into new bodies upon death) - but ACTUAL customization is rich. Different bodies have different stats, new weapons can be found and researched, weapons can be upgraded with atachments, characters can unlock and upgrade unique skills, equip various gear to make them better in combat, and also augment themselves with various wetware upgrades. In short - you won't get attached to characters visually, but they will definately be "yours".\n\nThe game does not have a "tactical pause". This is for balancing reasons. The gameplay as a whole, when broken down to its most basic, is rather simplistic. Grand strategies, complex maneuvers, etc are not necessarey to succeed - and sometimes are even impossible by design. This isn't that type of game. The challenge does not come from putting together and executing a master plan - but rather going after an objective a certain way and then adapting in real-time as the situation evolves, and possibly spirals out of control. This minor chaos is perhaps the best source of tension in the game, and is clearly there by design. A tactical pause would highlight just how simple the combat systems are, rob the player of much of the game's challenge and tension and bring the pace of the game to a crawl. It is inarguably better without it.\n\nWhich brings us to my next point -- It is best to think of this as a simple game with complex executions. The stealth mechanics, the combat mechanics, they are simple systems. Much like Syndicate of yore, you would be mistaken for thinking this was a strategy game. But that said, it involves much more thought and strategy than a typical shooter. This game exists in a sort of limbo, and frankly, I think that might make it hard to love. Too simple for strategy aficionados, too complex for action fans. For me, it hits a perfect sweet spot - something you can play after a tough day at work, but still have to have your brain switched on.\n\nThe final issues that people seem to be setting their sights on are those of story and save features. The story is limited. There. I said it. Yes... there is a story, and yes, those that read mission briefings will be treated to som great writing and have much more of the story fleshed out for them, but you have to go hunting for the story - it won't make itself known to you. And the save system... no, you can't save if you are in an enemy-controlled area (where nearly all the missions in the game take place). This can be a problem for some, but frankly, I've never encountered a mission that took me more than 30 minutes to get through. "Failing" a mission simply means that all your agents have died -- and you just releeve them and get new bodies. There are no bonuses for stealth, no penalities for shooting your way through, no penalities for civillian casualities, and very few penalities for death and failure. Because of this, the lack of an in-mission-save feature is not quite the crippling blow it could have been. Just like the original Syndicate - most missions encourage stealth from the outset, but will almost always evolve into a frantic shootout and death-defying escape. Know this before you purchase - it is an action game with stealth elements, not the other way around. Fully stealthing a mission is a rare thing.\n\nOverall, the game is of a high quality. It is far from perfect, and could certainly benefit from some more features (the devs say they will support the game into the future), but so long as you know what you're getting into with the game, I doubt you will be dissapointed. I hear a lot of people complain that they don't make games like they used to, the cyberpunk genre never gets enough love, Syndicate deserves a proper sequel, etc. Well, here's the chance to put your money where your mouth is.","June 22, 2015","true","13.5"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","35","39","0","2"

There are quite a few bugs and is nowhere near a complete game. There are plenty of "TBD" filler text and a number of core game features missing.\n- The game's design team seems pretty cohesive and the Cyberpunk vision for the game is very well executed.\n- It has very impressive, stunning visuals and animations. For an alpha, it runs well with Fantastic mode 1080p on a i7 3550K, 670GTX, 8GB RAM. I experienced no visual glitches.\n- It's a mouse and keyboard RTS (Real Time Strategy) kinda game.\n- You won't need to be an MLG-caliber APM-Deity to play. If you are, however, you can go for a raw speed challenge (by hitting two or three different objectives at once).\n- Gameplay wise, the demo vids are WYSIWYG straight up gameplay.\n- You have four guys, each with different specializations - a brawler, a medic, a thief, and a hacker - that you can use as a fireteam or turn them loose solo.\n- Currently you can execute a number of predesignated missions that demonstrate the classes utility and combat. All of them are basically infiltration quests of varying degrees.\n- You can opt for stealth or loudness and each are properly rewarded. Loudness is a lot like GTA's Wanted system, so things can get wild very quickly.\n\nTLDR: Satellite Reign is very well on its way to becoming the Syndicate successor I was hoping for when I backed.\n\nRecommendation for anyone on the fence/skeptical of early backing: Wishlist this game and keep an eye out.","December 11, 2014","true","2.8"," 42 of 51 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","42","51","0","0"

To different people, it means different styles. To some, cyberpunk means the virtual world. Net Runners decking into cyberspace and hacking corporate secrets for cash. To others, it means a Blade Runner-esque distopia, a perpetual night glistening with neon, heavy with sentient artifical life and the brutality of an uncaring elite.\n\nTo me, cyberpunk has always meant one thing, and it's thanks to a game from 1993, called Syndicate. Cyberpunk is trenchcoats. It's Miniguns. It's cybernetic implants and augmentations. It's corporate warfare where human casualties are simply an adjustment to your bottom line. Syndicate, and its follow-up in 1996, Syndicate Wars, were exactly what I wanted from a game set in the cyberpunk style.\n\nSatellite Reign is billed as a spiritual successor to the Syndicate franchise; with a number of the development team directly involved in the prior games. What they have created with Satellite Reign is a game with all the best elements of its ancestors - tactical squad-based action, with customisable weapon loads, choice-of-method for missions, and above all else - an environment that is absolutely perfect for the cyberpunk theme. The gameplay is exactly what Syndicate was, and will be familiar to anyone who played the previous games, or similar tactical squad games, such as Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel.  In a nutshell - You use your team of heavily armed cyborgs, and you take what you want. Tech. Money. Lives. Whatever furthers your company's interests.\n\nThere are some negative points to Satellite Reign, however.\n\nThere is little in the way of real character customisation. You can change their appearance based on the individual clone you assign to each member of the team, but these clones are randomised NPCs you chip-jack, and as such, you have no real control over what these clones will look like. Too often, the clones with the best stats will be hideous to look at - purple-mohawked men with giant orange beards that look like they were made from glued-on roadkill. In addition, augmenting your agents does nothing to their physical appearance. An unmodified clone will look exactly the same once you have replaced their arms, legs, skin and skull with machinery; and the interface for making these changes is little more than a click on a menu.\n\nBut these are minor personal-preference issues in a game that is otherwise brilliant. It's easy to play. It's easy to lose several hours of your life doing "one more assignment". It's amazing fun.\n\nSatellite Reign is Cyberpunk. Time to take control.","July 17, 2015","true","90.0"," 38 of 45 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","38","45","0","0"

At first I was amazed by the open space free roam and the amazing graphics. I also really liked the way there was multiple corporations keeping order and ruling the planet but the thing is, they didn't really trust each other. This led to huge firefights between the corporations which were fun to watch and they helped me sneak past the defenders into the facility which was a bonus. I liked the class diversity with the skill sytem. I liked the way that every class was able to use any weapon (if you had it) so, it wasn't limiting your ability. The missons at times felt a little bit repetitve at times with the magical green door but it wasn't a major problem. The more major problems were that sometimes your characters would occasionly get stuck in walls which was really annoying, when you were in red zone because you were then unable to save. Sometimes the AI would also be a bit stupid or sometimes they would just find you out of no where which was annoying. The cover system was also glitched at times. Civilians didn't really do anything except walk around, see you do something bad, run around and then get shot by the authorities, which was sad because maybe they could of had more of a purpose. The cars were basically mindless railed AI which you couldn't do much with except explode them which was also quite sad. The game itself ran quite smoothly. The music was well implemented and made the game more enticing. There was usually multiple ways with dealing with situations, which was nice. The game made me feel really important and needed!\n\nAll in all I think it was a good enjoyable game which constantly had me on my toes!

The simple answer is yes. If there had been a true sequel to the series instead of a shooter it would be this game. Even the audio is recognizable.\n\nIf you enjoyed the Syndicate series from the 90s then you should pick up this title and support it in early access. The more people who do, the better it will get, and I really wish more designers would take this sort of risk, go independent and bring back the sort of games that many of us grew up with and loved.\n\nThe design is really nice, the graphics are beautiful to look at, and there are cover mechanics which make so much sense in a game like this. There are variations in how you approach some of the quests and objectives in the game, you don't have to blast your way through every checkpoint, you can hack terminals and stealth your way through, of course when the time comes to go loud, the firefights can be intense. The AI will attempt to flank you, call for reinforcements, flush you out and you do have to manage your team to cover eachother and move, slipping away into the night and blending in with the crowd.\n\nIn the future I'd like to see some multiplayer modes of course, and some originality in the approach to it, drop-ins would be great, as well as multiplayer specific objectives. Moddability would also be great, I'd love to see some player created cities or total conversions, I could see people making some awesome RPGs with the concepts here.\n\nI've only recently picked up the game and I'll have more to add to this review as time goes on, in the meantime pick it up while it's on sale and support the developers, at the very least it's Syndicate with a complete graphical and gameplay overhaul, and that's definitely worth the price.\n","March 11, 2015","true","3.4"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","34","40","0","0"

There have been plenty of times where an enemy base looks insane on the map, only to find, with the right skills, you can get right in through a back entrance with almost no resistance if you look hard enough.\n\nOnly complaint is that it 'can' feel a little grindy at times. Although, in an hour or two you can make a lot of progress quickly that feels rewarding. So it's not too bad.\n\nOverall, I'm really liking the game for the price.  $30 seems like a fair price so far just based on what I've played.","August 29, 2015","true","34.8"," 39 of 50 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","39","50","3","0"

The good ones. Not the horror that Electronic Arts perpetuated, you know, the first person shooter that came with Skrillex making the theme tune (because apparently we really needed Skrillex ruining one of the best cyberpunk game themes in that era). Satellite Reign takes more of its' heritage from the somewhat unfairly criticised Syndicate Wars than the original, borrowing elements from both but then adding some unique elements of its' own, before souping up the graphics, really, really souping them up, and making the whole package relevant to today's crowd.\n\nDoes it work?\n\nIn a nutshell? Ohmighodyes\n\nClass based, mission orientated, but at the same time, the right kind of open world mentality...\nThe city is effectively one -giant- map, you can travel between districts at will, and the game will happily let you trundle around this huge, sprawling city, exploring all the nooks and crannies at will, various areas are controlled by the key antagonist corporations (The Eternals, Ronin, UzyKorp, Dracogenics, the Wyverns), they're deemed off limits and the moment you enter one, if you're detected you can expect a toasty reception from the guards. At the very least you'll be escorted off site and given a kick in the back, at worst you'll be served a bullet breakfast. Then again, you're not really here to just wave and say cheery words, you're in command of the finest your company has to supply, which at the beginning... isn't much.\n\nYou've managed to snag a prototype version of something called "Res_Tech" which allows you to resurrect your agents in the field to some extent, though it's far from perfect, the version you have will not preserve clones, so you'll need to replace them as clones are shot up. You've also a small sum of money provided to you by the corp, and your agents who come armed with futuristic Uzis and the Infiltrator comes packing a sniper rifle.\n\nPoking around the skill upgrade system hints at the sheer potential for carnage your soldiers -will- be able to unleash, but to begin with, you're weak, you're small. The first jobs are going to be skin of the teeth things as you scrounge resources, get a few prototypes and start building up those all important weapons, gear and augments. In this regard, it's -very- close to the original Syndicate games, the feeling of power as you steadily improve your agents from "Joe public with a gun" to "Cyber enhanced machines of destruction".\n\nThe persuadertron has been replaced with a button marked "Hijack", which allows you to hack the brainware of pretty much anyone provided you have the appropriate skillset for it, again, initially you can only brainwash members of the public, maybe some police officers and the odd thug, but once you skill up you'll be able to convert Soldiers and even enemy corp members and return them to the clone pool, adding valuable and highly sought after clone bodies that come with built in bonuses to your army.\n\nThe flow of the game is realtime all the way, each of your agents is class based, and as a result the game oft feels a bit like a MOBA but single player, with you managing the placement, tactical cover, targetting and skill usage of your various agents. As well as managing their skill growth, gear loadouts, enhancements etc. As you gain power and start adding more skills, you'll find that you get more comfortable with managing the myriad of options available, and you'll be planning your routes in and out of complexes with astute precision. The plan doesn't -always- survive contact with the enemy, but when you pull it off smoothly, you'll feel badass.\n\nBlade runner would be proud of this world...\nThe graphics and sound design are very, very evocative of Blade Runner, with it's permanent rain soaked roads, and it's bright, cheery neon which overlays a dying, decrepit city in the most part, with only the areas for the affluent still being maintained to a high standard. It's very much a telling commentary on what a city might look like in the future, and a very dystopian and gritty approach to world building, and in places feels like it could serve as set dressing for the very film I mention. Just throw Decker and some replicants into the world and you'd have the film to go.\n\nThe music too, strikes a lot of chords both with the original games, and with Blade Runner, with a lot of heavy use of synth, orchestral overtones, and an almost Vangelis style approach to building the atmosphere. It works brilliantly, ebbing between calm during the times of exploration and stealth, and tension and drama during combat. This is a game that really thrives on the atmosphere it has created, and it really draws you into that atmosphere.\n\nClosing thoughts\nSatellite Reign is an example of how Early Access and indeed Kickstarter -should- be done. No silly content stuff was hidden behind gates, indeed, the stuff offered to backers was cosmetic and if anything -added- to the game for other people rather than took away (by offering backers the opportunity to design things to be put into the game), I didn't back it for reference, but I did "due dilligence" (as these days a lot of devs ARE packing content into backer tiers), and the Early Access was done right, with gameplay and bug fixing shaping and informing the product until it was polished and most of the rough edges were taken out of the game. It's still -got- a few rough edges, but they'll get patched out soon enough, for a 1.0 release this is a remarkably polished game. One that stands up to repeated playthroughs, and offers a lot of game for your money, and your time.\n\nVerdict : Highly recommended","August 30, 2015","true","66.5"," 45 of 61 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","45","61","2","0"

Unfortunatly after you leave the little tutorial area things start to get wonky.\n\nOnce I crossed that first bridge and made my way to the streets I found tons of cars, some piled onto each other, some floating, still more ramming the jammed cars. This wasn't limited to just one area either. Most streets were piled up like this, making movement across them difficult.\n\nA quick restart seemed to have fixed this issue. But couldn't fix the rather unresponsive and painful Agent movement AI...It is horrible.\n\nI often have to click and reclick areas for my agents to move into because one, or all will fail to actually get behind cover, they seem to like standing at the very edge of cover, like a dog hiding behind a barren branch of a house plant. Going up and down elevators often has my agents piling up on the side of the elevator in an endless running animation that I can't seem to cancel, and overall responsiveness to commands is rather slow.\n\nCombat and stealth are both negilible there really are no pros or cons to each. Eventually you don't even use combat or stealth. Because in compounds where you have to infiltrate and raid stuff it is usually as easy as running in and running back out no stealth or fighting required, though you will trip some alarms don't worry! Enemy AI is rather dumb, the enemy movents are also pretty slow. Often times I just find myself sprinting past them with my loot, once you leave the compound you are as good as gone because the enemy rarely follows you that far. Hell they rarely follow you around a cornor, assuming you can make it around yourself without getting caught on something.\n\nI also seem to experience some pretty random crashes.\n\nI like the game, I really do it has its moments.

It has a nice cyberpunk atmosphere, a lot of replayability and a good ending I didn't see coming.\n\nHowever, this game was released way too early. It is rife with bugs and glitches that make the game much, much more frustrating than it should be. I wouldn't have minded the micromanaging and no-pause gameplay if I didn't have to worry about horrible pathfinding (my agents would often get stuck on corners), idiotic A.I. (guards continuouslty running in place/into closed gates), clipping through the environment (Agents and escort NPCs would OFTEN get stuck in the environment, or just warp through walls, fall through floors, etc.), Agents simply refusing to obey commands (not a feature, just stuck A.I.) and a long list of other problems. Nearly all of which forced me to find another way to complete a given task, which renders the whole "find your own approach" thing moot.

Let's be honest, I loved the original Syndicate, this feels like the spiritual successor to it and even some members of the development team worked on the original which shows through in spades.\n\nThe tutorial introduces the basics and you'll gather together the team of 4 which will be with you throughout the game.\n\nThe city is divided up in to several districts which require special credentials to access, this means initially bribing, shooting, generally making a mischief of yourself in the different areas to aquire the passes, whilst also subverting the local corporations' operation in the zone to make make things easier on your team if the need arises.\n\nHow you go about it is very open ended - as you roam the city and hack data terminals, logs and missions come to light which are up to you which order to complete or take note of, if indeed you will bother at all. It seems to me that visiting the zones and installing all the ATM syphons possible in order to plough money in to research is as valid as anything else.\n\nOn the subject of strategy, of course you could go in loud with guns blazing - often enough this seem like the last resort. Making use of the robust cover and stealth system allows for your agents equipped with the necessary skills to sneak around, climb through vents, hack in to power terminals and even hack guards on your way to the goal without firing a shot on the way to subvert the evil corporations. There are things in the mission which are discoverable, and not immediately obvious which give the game an immersive feel and lets the mind wander, consider possibilities, look around the map and find the weak spot that suits your team and methods rather than being a linear play through. The tools and augments at hand need to be considered, the layout of the facility and an individual's approach to a given set of objectives taken in to account.\n\nThings inevitably go wrong on missions such as these.. you get spotted due to bad planning, being over confident, whatever it is, that is where combat starts to happen. Stimulants from the support team member can slow down time and recover health, whilst allowing precious moments to reposition and set your sniper up to obtain the advantage. Or maybe you book it to the nearest vent and try to hide until the heat dies down and regroup. It's not an easy game and things can go from absolutely peachy to a maelstrom in seconds sometimes.\n\nFar from being out of the game after losing a battle, perhaps during the process you were able to "persuade" (or hack in this case) a guard or two on the way which will allow you to replace the clones you have, or maybe it's possible to drop them in using the F.R.E.D system. I dont want to give too much away. The game introduces early on the idea of obtaining "clones" from the people on the street to restock your team in the event that things go pear shaped and the city offers a wide variety of people with different abilities and benefits. Guards and police can make special prizes if you can get them onside.\n\nThe scenery of the city is great, reminiscent again of the great Syndicate of old reminding me with its overpasses, huge video screens on buildings beaming advertisements or propaganda in to the street and the people wandering about, going to bars and hanging out at the market. The ever oppressive corporate police force and their drones stalk the city looking for citizens who step out of line. The cars whizz around on the tight roads in each district which has it's own vibe and layout.\n\nThis game really got my heart going as I hoped not to be discovered by the drones and 5 strong security force which passed right by my hiding place in a secure area as I planned to steal some stuff. It feels like a real world where in some spots, you're really responsible for this little crew, in a world dominated by forces bigger than your own.","August 4, 2015","true","49.9"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","27","32","0","0"

First lets start off with combat, the combat is pretty straight forward once you have switched from incognito mode to weapons ready by pressing the space bar you simply right click an enemy to start firing. The game also employs a cover system for both combat and stealth. When you have you characters selected and hover the mouse over any object like a wall you'll get markers as to where your agents will take cover should you decide to move them there. The combat overall feels very similar to Dawn of War 2 where your taking a squad in combat cover to cover and using abilities. I think the combat still needs some work to make it more interesting, first the AI needs a lot of work to make it challenging. Second they pathing of both player controlled characters and AI needs work as pathing just doesn't work at the moment. Thirdly a progression of enemies is needed to keep the challenge, you need more than just a couple enemy types in different skins. Finally the abilities that are yet to be implemented should be something cool. You need abilities that can change the flow of battle or add new options to your strategies, the combat needs to be interesting.\n\nThe mission system in the current version is also limited and your progression in it is also limited due to many of the games features not being implemented. Ultimately I think the current missions are a showcase of the games core functionality rather than a view of what's to come. The reason I say that is that each mission has you doing the exact same thing which is infiltrating a facility. If that is all the missions are going to be in the final game, well, its going to be dull. That being said one thing I was happy to see was the emphasis on achieving the goal in your own way. Each objective has multiple paths, you can go in guns blazing or send in one agent and focus on stealth. There are a variety of tactics for you to use and I really hope the developers build upon this foundation.\n\nYour agents portraits at the bottom display their health, energy for things like sprinting and experience bar. They also have a wanted level to the side similar to a GTA style wanted bar. This will so you when your in a restricted area and if you cause to much trouble by having firefights or killing people, the bar will increase causing more enforcement to arrive.\n\nAgents each have loadouts and you can equip them with different weapons, armor and cybernetic upgrades that will affect stats. You will also come across designs such as weapon plans that once you have researched them which requires time and money will give you access to those items that you can then build and equip. currently there isn't much in the way of items in the game and I would certainly hope to see a lot of items in game come full release.\n\nThe world itself is a simulated city, as you walk through the streets people will be going about their daily lives. Hover cars zoom down the roads which you can get in but its not a fun as you think as its essentially on rails so you cant veer from the road. The city looks both depressing and full of vibrant life as the neon lit billboards shine off the wet concrete floors.\n\nGraphically even in this early build the game is looking very nice. The animations look smooth and graphical effects such as rain, gunfire and explosions are visual pleasing. The art style the team have gone for is very eye catching, the neon colours against the sea of grey stands out well, everything in the world thus far looks very good. Visually the biggest issue is the current UI, its doesn't work well. Character portraits are too small, text is hard to read and often blurred or even outright glitched. The menus don't look very good and due to their current layout, nothing flows well sometimes you cant tell if something can be pressed. Ultimately the current menus and overall UI is a mess and definitely needs a rework, it is possible that this was just a temporary UI however if this is what they were going to be going for, please don't. Everything from aiming reticles to the character portraits needs redesigned, a clear, fluid and vivid UI design will go a long way.\n\nIn this early access build currently there is no real tutorial and due to the main story thus far not yet being implemented in any big way, if your looking for a well told narrative at this point you won't find it. I certainly feel that once the game reaches full release, the writing and overall narrative will be crucial in keeping people playing. While I am all for the emergent gameplay the game is trying to provide, you still need a good story and narrative to find reason.\n\nIn terms of future content the developers have stated that there is an array of features to come. Things like additional skills, abilities, weapons, items plus factional relationships and a propaganda system. There will of course be more districts to play through though whether these will be released throughout early access or saved until full release is unclear. Another feature yet to be implemented is cloning, from what it sounds like cloning could be a feature that serves as a character customization tab as well as a explanation as to why your agents can respawn after they die. At the end of the day this build is a very early build and it's clear there is a ton of content to be implemented. The future content does sound promising but we shall have to wait and see what comes of it.\n\nI must warn you there are a ton of bugs in this version and its not just small bugs, there is occasionally some progress hampering stuff in here. Not is only is there a lot of bugs but a ton of the games features are yet to be implemented as such your realistically only getting a skeleton of a game but it does have some nice looking bones. I feel that amply sums up the entire early access build currently, Yes it holds a lot of potential and looks nice but in terms of actual game to play, as of yet there's not much to it. I think unless your dead set on being involved in the testing right now you may wish to hold off until the game has a lot more content. For the price you are paying I would recommend that people wait until release or at least very late on in early access until many more features have been put in.","January 2, 2015","true","1.6"," 34 of 44 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","34","44","0","1"

Lovejones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrMojoPhD/","117 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI recommend and review games rarely; most are fodder that I just churn through, especially early access titles. Satellite Reign is the rare exception to this. It takes everything that was right with the classic Syndicate and its sequel, Syndicate Wars, adds an nice dash of inspiration from Dawns of War I & II.\n\nThe presentation is beautiful, putting lie to undeserved reputation the Unity engine gets from low-rent mobile developers and indie devs with big ideas and small skillsets.\n\nGraphically the game shines, even on mid-spec systems, with high-end systems taking the cyberpunk-noirish feel to the next level. The city is bathed in perpetual night and omnipresent rain with neon signs (and tonemapping) abounding, giving it a mise-en-scene evoking Blade Runner.\n\nThe music is equally nice, quoting liberally from Syndicate -- no surprise since 5 Lives' first Kickstarter stretch goal was to hire Russell Shaw, the composer and sound designer behind Syndicate and Syndicate Wars, as well as plenty of other Bullfrog and Lionhead titles.\n\nThe level design is also great, having an open world that's broken up into districts, giving Satellite Reign a much bigger, more sprawling feel than its spiritual predecessor, as is fitting for the cyberpunk genre. The districts each feel noticeably distinct, even perpetually dark and wet as they are, from the gritty, working-class industrial district to the gleaming, gentrified Grid, a religious enclave devoted to a transhumanist AI cult.\n\n5 Lives has also been quite good with their fundraising and delivery. Their Kickstarter was one of the most well-thought-out Kickstarters I'd ever seen, showing a sense of budgeting and proportion that deviates from the standard Kickstarter fare that deviates wildly between promising each investor a personal, life-sized replica of Europe for five dollars or million dollar stretch goals to give you the ability to save your game.\n\nWith this kind of budgeting and good money sense, you get the feeling 5 Lives intends to stand behind their promise of continuing to use funds generated from the pre- and post-launch purchases to flesh out the game more. While the last leg of develop has seen fully fleshing out the four districts originally planned for that funding level (Downtown, Industrial, Grid, and CBD districts), it's clear that the game is a labor of love for 5 Lives, and it's not hard to imagine they fully intend to complete the game as they originally wanted it, with the two additional districts (Slums and Sci-Tech) and factions (Disconnected and ... well, Sci-Tech, respectively) added in as budget allows.\n\nThis also raises the promise of post-launch cooperative, which the game is simply begging for. It's no doubt that this would be a massive undertaking in terms of netcode, implementation, and balance, but the design of the game itself, from the unique skillsets of the agents the player controls to the absolute scope, screams for interplayer cooperation and communication, similar to the Dawn of War games Satellite Reign takes its inspiration from.\n\nWith that in mind, it's pretty well recommended that you purchase this -- the single player is complete as it stands, guaranteeing your money's worth. The very realistic promise of future expansion, as well as the smart delivery of previous promises made by the developer, only stretches your gaming buck more.\n\nThere are complaints, of course: Gone is the Nintendo-hard aspects of the original Syndicate series, as anybody who's played the final Atlantic Accelerator mission from Syndicate will attest to. Or, for that matter, the first level of Syndicate's expansion, American Revolt.\n\nPart of this lack of difficulty is from the commensurate lack of squishiness on the part of both your own agents and the enemies. As anybody who's played the original Syndicate series will remember, the glorious carnage was borne in large part by how fragile and human everybody in the game was, including your own cyborgs, whose deaths never failed to remind you that they were heavily-armed bits of cybernetic hardware, albeit grafted on to hairless apes, with all the mortality that implies.\n\nYou won't find yourself molested by police who quickly die in a hail of gunfire, and some of the more frenetic firefights can go from tense to protracted as you watch your agents slowly chew through enemy armor. You also won't find as many civilians caught in the crossfire, though it does happen. And with that lack of squishiness on the part of your agents, you can often go feeling particularly unthreatened.\n\nThat's simply honesty, however, and shouldn't deter you from buying, playing, and enjoying the game.","August 24, 2015","true","67.8"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","0"

I played a bit in the current state (pre-alpha) and everything is there: the dystopian atmosphere, your four agents, the Cops, the Corps... It is like a jump into the past. Even if it is just a pre-alpha you can have some fun and have an idea about what will be the full game (but don't pretend too much it is still in dev!). Major differences from old Syndicate Titles? First the background is different. The action is all in a single City (Yeah no more World Map) and you represent a Group ready to change the Status Quo. All your Agents have a Class (I.E. Hacker) that can give you a tatical advantage (I.E. Hacker can open for a certain amount of time closed gates\doors). You get your misson while being active in the City (Currently you can only explore a single District) via the Map Interface where also you manage your team. I really like this idea of a single hunge Setting with constant action. I will probably write a better summary and review once I have more of this title under my grasp. However, give it a shot, you will not regret it, if you are an Old Gamer from 80s as me.","December 13, 2014","true","15.3"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","27","33","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bilazaurus/recommended/268870/","bilazaurus","Bilazaurus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bilazaurus/","262 products in account",""This game is great except that part". You've probably said that many times. It's all the underwater levels, all the time based puzzles in adventure games, all the long, sluggish vent crawling or time consuming backtracking. Satellite Reign's issue is that this "part" never ends. There's a faint light of something rewarding, something exciting and you follow it, get closer to it but you never arrive. You complete numerous chores, go through same routine, keep your frustration in check. But you never get there. That's how I feel about Satellite Reign.\n\nBefore I delve into depths of Satellite Reign's troubled nature, some forewords. Most of you probably heard of Satellite Reign due to it's similarity to cult classic Syndicate. The latter was a very succesful action-strategy game designed around dystopian, cyber-punk theme where corporation reached tremendous power. It was a blast, I loved it. You set up your own company, capture agents, research new technologies, implant\naugmentation to your agents, fight competition, assassinate political opposition and on and on. All the means to take over, reign the world.\n\nNow, wanting to describe Satellite Reign I would have to write exact introduction as in previous paragraph. Satellite Reign has precisely the same premise with minor differences. The idea is the same. As a group of corporate agents, you fight hard to establish world domination with almost exclusively less than legal means. Dracogenics, your main competitor, owns a technology to transfer one’s mind and conscience to another body provided as a vessel. This revolutionary tech makes immortality more than possible. But even most precious and secured treasures can be stolen. With help from a mole in Dracogenics, your company acquires a crude version of mind-transfer solution. This is where you start.\n\nAs the game begins, you’re guided through few introduction missions learning the first steps in neon-lit, rain soaked city. At first, everything seems clear, logical, well tailored. While ticking off subsequent objectives you learn Corporate Agent 101 but let me assure you, it won’t prepare you for what you’ll be facing, but more on that later. As soon as tutorial is over, it’s you and dystopian streets straight from Blade Runner. And that’s the first major problem with Satellite Reign. It’s dark, grimy, futuristic world is all too familiar and even trite, typical. Litter streets with thrash, give citizens some hi-tech gizmos, let oddly shaped cars roam the roads, erect loads of skyscrapers and wrap everything in bright neon lightning. At the same time it's oddly sterile. The city looks like distopy is more a local sense of aestetics than simply real disrepair. Divided into several districts, it looks all the same. I can see that they tried to make it an open world but this attempt just failed. This city is dead. Few civilians wander back and forth without a hint of purpose, looking bland and clone-alike. Only corporate and military patrols make some sense though still robotic. Clunky and glitchy animation doesn't help much. There's no fluence when people wander, god knows where and make sharp, instant turns like in early, 90's 3d games.\n\nThe very same problem prevails when it comes to missions. You're promised a variety of choices on how to complete your task while in reality it's not much short of an illusion. Especially during first half of Satellite Reign you're forced to complete your quest for domination in a same, patience draining way. It's all about stealth. You access forbidden areas by either hacking, jacking security officer's minds(much like with persuade-gun in Syndicate) hard-wiring or accessing skylines or vents which in a way is fun. There are also turrets shooting you at sight and cameras raising alarms, both of which can be hacked or turned off. Every solution requires specific skill and your agents will all play their own role\nin accessing secure places(up to a point that is, later they can be upgraded to do all sort of things). In the end, you'll see that every location has the same weaknesses and points of exploitation.\n\nIt still requires tremendous amount of patience. Guards patrol premises in seemingly planned paths but often stray from it and wander chaotically. They collide when crossing paths and chaos emerges. Sometimes I had to stand still behind a cover for many minutes because guard got stuck climbing a curb and the rest of them concentrated in one point. On the other hand, there were times when I raised high alarm and I could few inches past guards with my squad, weapons out, and they didn't even react. That's not right, is it?\n\nAlmost every stealth based game implement some kind of routine for your enemies, something you can learn and exploit. And you know that map creator did it on purpose to give you a window of time to make a go for it.\nThat's not the case in Satellite Reign. It seems chaotic, unplanned which makes it more life-like but also very frustrating.\nDisasterous or more precaisly inexistent AI makes it all the harder. You have to issue every single smallest command, else your troops will stand still like a mentally challenged after extra lobotomy.\n\nAll of this lead me to quickload very often which unfortunately takes some tiem. During at least first half of game, you'll be outgunned and outnumbered. And don't think of forcing your way with head on assault. If you're not careful enough, you'll deal with a lot's of reinforcements and if you take your time, they'll eventually take you down. Fortunately, that doesn't mean permadeath. Your agents are respawned in a nearest relay which puprose is to "transfer" one's concience. To a degree, your agents bonus stats are then diminished to penalize you for lightheadedness. Still you can "persuade" more potent civilians/military men to join your cause and use them as a previously mentioned vessel for agent's concience.\n\nGetting back to missions, there is a sense of satisfaction when you complete them. You receive money, technology, access to other districts or you simply advance in main story. And that kept me going to the end of Satellite Reign - getting new means, weapons and implants to even the odds and make next mission easier to complete. I think this is the most redeeming part of Satellite Regin, the part when all of your effort pays off. Later on, buffed with advanced implants and weaponry you can assault enemy bases. While you still have to hide from reinforcements every now and then, it's certainly fun to blast your enemies for a change.\n\nUnfortunately, as you rise in power, you realise that there nothing more to it. That's the whole game. You've seen all that there is to see and you know that you've spent far too many hours to expect anything else.As the story unfolded I cared less and less about it. I didn't care much for snippets of lore in hackable panels. It didn't made me to do it, I didn't feel a need. The only point where I found the plot interesting is the very ending of Satellite Reign. But is it worth spending about 30 hours to experience it? I don't think so, but it's worth a try when the price is right.\n\nIf you're looking for a Syndicate successor due to sentiment, you'd be better off playing the classic once more.\n\nNote: Satellite Reign has some serious issues running 60fps even on most powerful computers including mine.\n\nPros:\n\n- Satisfaction after successful mission completion\n- Researching new tech and upgrading your agents is always fun\n- Game lenght is just right\n- Good ending\n- More than a single way to complete a mission, though rather illusionary\n\nCons:\n\n- Mediocre dystopian cyberpunk theme, too bland\n- So-so music and graphic\n- Disasterous graphic performance even on fast computers\n- Can be incredibely frustrating\n- Balance and AI issues\n- Can be buggy\n- Not a Syndicate successor we waited for\n\nTested on :\n- Satellite Reign version 1.4\n- OC'd i5 3570K, 8GB RAM DDR3, GTX 980TI G1 Gaming, 1440p.","January 18","false","31.0"," 42 of 59 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","42","59","0","0"

I might have clicked around in some menues. After 10 minutes i quit. This revamp held (and currently holds) my attention abit longer.\n\nThe "story" is simple and told thru a single cutscene over the whole game (i assume theres one at the end) : Theres evil corporations who dominate the world and are rich so you use four super (eventually) agents to subvert and sabotage their stuff because youre just as evil but without the dominating and rich parts.\n\nAfter a short tutorial youre pretty much free to go wherever and do whatever you want to the various installations littered all over the world with no barriers except your dudes being to weaksauce to tackle some harder targets (theres border checkpoints requiring some extra work for passage but you could theoretically shoot your way thru aswell).\n\nTo remedy that you earn xp by doing stuff and leveling up your guys rpg style (no refunds) and equipment and money by doing missions - which almost always entail getting into a place and then getting out with the items alive. But theres also other stuff like simply breaking into the sectors guard station to weaken overall security and the like.\n\nThe four classes are :\n- Soldier : Huge beefy shooty man (or woman depending on the clone) being good at being huge, beefy and shooty. Has his own version of hacking for simple mechanical devices\n- Support : Scan ability (Batvision) and various increasingly powerful passive squad bonuses\n- Assassin : Snipz0r, more importantly can go invisible and use shortcuts other agents would need gear or augments for\n- Hacker : Gets the torrents and pr0n, can use drones (meh) and mindjack people for a WIDE range of shenanigans\n\nLike mentioned you level up your dudes and put points into stuff to get abilities or stronger versions of them. Then theres also outfitting with weapons, gear (from medkits to armor to zip line hooks) and augments (i asked for this) which all can be gained by buying from the black market at horrid prices or nabbing prototypes from various places and then use them right away or research for mass production X-Com style.\n\nSince the whole thing is basically a fancy breaking-and-entering sim it could have fallen flat on its butt very easily if the maps or tools provided were badly or boringly designed. This isnt the case, each place is unique and presents a unique layout and challenge.\n\nTheres more stuff like the cloning and bonus attributes and whatnot but i guess this is quite enough.

But with all that flashy cyberpunk I feel like the game is a little hollow inside. And by that I mean it lacks some character, or charisma. It actually doesn't do a lot of exposition and the story is there just to be there. I really want to compare it with Shadowrun Returns since they are kindof two sides of the same coin. Shadowrun is really engaging, so interesting to follow, but not actually "a lot of fun" to play. SR on the other hand is damn fun, but man I wish there was more reason for all of it.

It 100% delivers on the kind of experience it promises.\nWhat I liked:\nIt's never punishing. It's not easy, but I could play casually for an hour or two at a time, and I had no problem experimenting with very different styles of play. Every awesome combo you think might work? It works awesomely. Nothing feels nerfed or unsatisfying, and I felt rewarded for experimenting.\nIt's a truly open world. My favorite part of each mission was panning over the target base, considering the tremendous breadthe of options. Sneaking from cover to cover with cloak, hijacking guards to open doors, turning off the generators to lock out reinforcements, blasting everyone to pieces... virtually any strategy can work if done right.\nThe city and theme are perfect. The city is vast and full of little details (the names of the businesses cram in every sci-fi reference imaginable).  There were dozens of bases for the ~100 missions, and they never felt repetitive.  I am hard-pressed to think of a game setting more richly realized.\nWhat I didn't like:\nThe interface will be your biggest enemy. Firefights happen very fast, uninjured opponents blend into the scenery, and killing the enemy radioing for back-up can be the difference between victory and a Bolivian army ending.  This only gets worse as your units will gain more abilities requiring activation. The Team Stim ability functions a bit like an active pause, but it has too many quirks (it slows down scrolling too, it requires a recharge, etc).\nIt's buggy. Nothing game breaking, but the bugs are plentiful. One example: NPCs in my party frequently couldn't use vents and got stuck in the geometry. Another example: At the moment I finished the game, I had an ability on which slowed time to 10%... which then stayed on for the entire final cut scene.\nThe rules aren't clear or consistent. It was often very difficult to determine the consequences of a given action, and there were many instances where the AI behaved in an odd or inconsistent way.  One example: Hijacked (mind-controlled) enemies can walk by most opponents just fine, but turrets invariably blasted them to pieces, for no clear reason.  Another example: Cloaked melee attacks resulted in no response about half the time, and all the opponents immediately going on alert the other half.\nThe plot and characters could be more interesting.  The overall plot and the individual missions aren't much more than "those guys are bad" and "theres money and weapons here".  There were several game elements (resurrection, cloning, hijacking peoples brains) which had huge potential to deal with complex body horror/human nature themes, but were never really explored.Ultimately, I loved this game.

Its a very slow paced game at the beginning but if you ever played "Commandos" than you well love this game.

Some of the most unbelievable examples are that very fast characters (mostly the Infiltrator) won't even be able to turn a corner right in front of him without the pathfinding spazzing out. Instead he will run into the corner, stumble back and then thanks to the forceful repositioning he will finally be able to pass the corner without bumping into anything.\n- excessive unnecessary micromanagement in a real-time only game - it just doesn't give any options to manage your characters eg. aggressive/passive stances and/or any kind of sentry mode a la Fallout Tactics, let alone any kind of scriptable macros  like "use shield recharge when shields below 25%" a la Dragon Age. Combat stims - an ability of one of your agents - is supposed to be a bit of an replacement for a tactical pause but its execution is pretty broken, upgrading it is actually very counterproductive but once you realize this you're already stuck with it and no rollback is possible. I ended up pretty much never using it.\n- which leads us to the second big bugbear: The latter is intentional because 'mah artistic vision' thus the devs seem intent to ignore the common criticism the game received that it lacks many basic functions expected in a tactical RTS.\n- this is made worse by the fact that the micro management mostly is just busywork, your bigger picture strategy is really whats gonna be critical in deciding encounters in your favour\n- the story is pretty much non-existent. Not really an issue for me in a game like this but it's worth mentioning.\n- the stealth approach is a bit too heavily emphasized or vice versa the combat oriented approach too heavily penalized\n- kind of in the same vein: the pacing is very odd, you get the best stealth gear/implants midway through the game but the best combat gear barely before the game ends. I even had to aimlessly idle around attacking random stuff I already had raided before while the research on said combat equip finished up before the final mission.\n- the save system is too restrictive - while you can save any time everything in the word will be reset and you will be relocated to a relay/"safe area" upon load. It's impossible to resume an infiltration/attack and considering that it can take around 2h for large compounds later in the game if you wanna hit all facilities this can be a real problem. You don't have an option to shut down the game with the word state intact and resume next time either. You can use OS functions like hibernate as a workaround but the game itself really should offer solutions for this.\n\nIn conclusion this game is a 'more than flawed' gem, a bit of a wasted opportunity really. Kind of flawed to the degree where it burst into pieces but instead of trying to piece them together the devs are stubborn about leaving it at that and calling it modern art.\nThe sentry/stance issue and the hideous pathfinding that never should have made it past early access are the biggest reasons why I can't recommend this game in good conscience - especially because the 'mah artistic vision' attitude of the devs indicates nothing of this will be improved in future patches.\n\nPersonally I still enjoyed this game a lot but that's mostly because I played enough old games with similar issues (too much unnecessary micromanagement, bad pathfinding) to have grown a bit numb to these issues - but I still call them out for what they are: flaws, not "artistic quirks" worth striving for. If anything even if you have a fetish for this stuff just give the player more options.\nSome food for thought: One month after the release global stats show that only ~3.5% of players actually finished the game. Completion rates tend to be surprisingly low for all games in general, but 3.5% is just awful.\n\n\nEdit: Small update: It's getting close to one year since release and on a whim I checked the game out again. The good news: the Infiltrator seems to be able to round corners without the pathfinding bugging out now.\nHowever the completion rate for this game is still only around ~5-6% which is a good amount below usual rates and a good indicator that a lot of players didn't seem to find the game interesting enough or too flawed to stick with until the end.","September 5, 2015","false","62.3"," 49 of 74 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","49","74","4","3"

I've been a long time fan of Syndicate. When I heard this announced, I was very excited. Shadowrun had recently come back to life, now a spiritual successor to Syndicate was on the way. Life was becoming awesome again.\n\nI'm going to start off by saying I like the art style of the game.  It's very well done. Visually, I really like the game. Tracking down and bribing scientists to join your cause, people to help sabotage cameras, etc. is all good in my books. Even the fact that I primarily get funding by robbing people and banks makes it even better.\n\nMy biggest gripe, and what gives me so much frustration, and subsequently, this title a negative review, is the combat.\n\nMy squad is dumber than a sack of potatoes. They have, zero AI.\nGetting shot? Cool, just take it bro. No need to react on your own accord.\nClick to attack an enemy on the other side of a wall? Just keep shooting the wall! Don't try to go around then fire, that's just crazy.\nTaking a lot of fire? Why take cover? Just stand there while the opponent's AI makes smart decisions. Like opening fire, then running to cover, then waiting a few seconds before firing again.\n\nWhile I don't totally regret buying this game, mostly because I got it on sale, either the player team's AI needs a serious overhaul, or the game needs a pause function so I can issue orders to my team of marauding lobotomized clones, so they don't die in 10 seconds during a firefight.\n\nedit: I should also add, that I play this game on Ironman. So when a clone with high physical stats dies, it can take a while to find a replacement body with similar stats. Otherwise, you're stuck resurrecting them into the lowest-tier body available, which makes life difficult if you're doing a difficult mission.","December 24, 2015","false","4.3"," 38 of 55 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","38","55","3","5"

I'll spend 10-15 min running around the edges of a compound scanning the infrastructure to see what nearby generators power, where doors and cameras can be hacked from, what vents are accessible- planning my entry and exit from the facility down to the last detail. Scans only go so far in though and once the outer defenses have been breached there's a point where you just have to wing it; this transition from strategy to improvisational tactics is thrilling and a high point every time around. The combination of the game's format and mechanics allow for this to shine like no other game I've played. Xcom does the squad tactics thing better with its cool, clearheaded tactical assault approach, but Satellite Reign has no turns, no pause, no stopping to think (and no saves behind enemy lines ;) ).

I'll let you read it first, and then I can say what's improved since then.  (or you can skip if it's tl;dr)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis game is pre-Alpha.   As such, I went into it expecting bugs, and I certainly found them:\n\nAgents forgetting how to hack, doors mysteriously not working, people with invisible bodies, cars doing forward flips occasionally and refusing to explode when shot at for any length of time, also not letting Agents out and having to do a Total-Party Kill, occasionally forming many many car traffic jams for not always obvious reasons, the game either having periodic moments of lag or hitting a complete wall of unresponsiveness that killed the game entirely and requiring a complete log-out to fix.\n\nYet still, I recommend this game?\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it feels like Syndicate Wars.  It looks different, sure, better graphics, more colour, but the atmosphere of the city feels like Syndicate Wars.   The top down iso view feels like Syndicate Wars.   Controlling 4 guys feels like it, the weapons feel as satisfying.  It's got hover cars!   Whatever it's kept or changed since Syndicate Wars, it feels like it's either matched it or done it better.\n\nMoney no longer comes from mysterious sources, but from hacking ATMs and robbing banks.  Rather than blowing them up, you actually get to sneak into a compound and take it over.\n\nResearch comes from actually finding blueprints that you can send off to R&D for upgrades.   You can acquire doctors and researchers for improving your R&D lab capabilities.\n\nYou don't get to have whole persuadertron armies following you around, but whilst they were deeply satisfying and fun, they were a little OP, now you get to hijack people instead and have total control over them and their movements, which means it's a lot more balanced and you have to think more carefully about who you're going to persuade.\n\nI do miss blowing things up, but I'm hoping that will make an arrival in due course.   I'm also glad they got rid of the masses of clones that you'd never use in the original games (who ever completed a mission with an Agent down?  you'd lose so much tech and weaponry it was genuninely not worth it.)   The specialisation is a neat feature and allows for the possibility of some interestingly varied tactical game-play.\n\nI love the additional depth you get from the side-missions that you can unlock for money.   The ability to get security card access to an entire facility for putting in that little bit of extra effort is a nice reward and makes them worthwhile doing.\n\nAll this, and it's still pre-Alpha?   Loving it so far and looking forward to seeing it develop further.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo, it's been released.   Would I still recommend it?\n\nYES.\n\nSo, all those bugs that were causing problems have been squashed, there might be a couple lingering around, but I've not noticed them yet.   I'll get this in early in the review in case you get so excited hearing me rave about it that you want to dash off and play it.  If you plan on reading the Novella, if you can restrain yourself from playing the game, go read that first if you don't want the Novella to be spoilered, or conversely, if you don't want the game to be spoilered, and you want to find all the information terminals that add some lovely fluff to the game's backstory, then play the game, then read the Novella and enjoy seeing what led up to the start of the game.\n\nIn my original review, I said I was pleased they got rid of the clones, and now the game has them, you might think I might be a little 'meh' about them.   Get yourself a Grade 4+ hacker, go hack some base commanders to have as your clones and then see how 'meh' you feel.\n\nI'm normally a fan of PC Gamer, but their review (a not entirely shabby 80) felt a little like they'd just played the game for a bit and then moved on to something else, the most damning line being\n\n'Your agents movement is slow and heavy, making the battles feel sluggish'  This might be true when you've got a newly started game with a bunch of rookies, but once you've trained them up and given them access to bigger hardware, there's a bit more punch.   Throw in an extra squad of hijacked soldiers and then suddenly firefights become a lot more punchy and you can happily mow your way through the enemies.\n\nOh, and the explosions are back and as glorious as ever.   Also, you can throw them around like candy when your Agents are at their spawn point as it instantly reloads.  It's a nice way of having a safe area you can run to if you've got an entire army doggedly chasing you down and you need to rest and recouperate.\n\nAlso, I love the freedom to choose how to tackle missions.   There are so many different approaches you can try and switching between them is a simple case of swapping out weapons, augments and gear and you're good to go.   If I had to recommend an addition, it would be the ability to create 'sets' that you could switch between, but that's a fairly minor point.\n\nOh, and the book, I like it, it's very well written and has inspired me to try my own hand at writing something.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone that loves a good bit of tactical strategy, enjoys blowing things up, and loves their cyberpunk dystopias.","December 12, 2014","true","95.1"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","19","24","0","0"

Employ. Steal. Deploy.\nTrack. Stalk. Assault. Destroy.\n\nA bit of history.\n\nComputer games were something of a wonder back when I was in school. They enabled me to live adventures that I was otherwise unable to realize in real life. Each new game had something fresh in it, but one that stood out for me was called SYNDICATE. Released in 1993 by Bullfrog, it stuck me with its SVGA (640x480) isometric graphics, vast open maps and freedom to achieve your objectives as you saw fit. Armed with a huge arsenal of useful weapons, the sheer carnage you could unleash on the screen with your four cybernetically augmented agents, made it one of the most memorable games of the 90’s. In 1996, a sequel called SYNDICATE WARS was released, using a modified engine from Bullfrog’s, Magic Carpet, it added fully 3D level maps and changed some of the mechanics. It also ramped up the difficulty of the missions with the final ones being nigh impossible to beat. The sequel struggled beneath the shadow the original it would be another sixteen years before a fresh attempt was made. In 2012, Starbreeze Studios tried to remodel the game as an FPS and, while I appreciated the effort, most didn’t.  Paradox Entertainment considered a spiritual successor, The Cartel, which has still yet to pan out. The foundation gathered dust. And then, a kickstarter project called Satellite Reign was launched.\n\nSo what is Satellite Reign?\n\nIt is the year 2188 and Steven Dangler the head of Dracogenics had developed a way of transcending death. His technology of copying human memory and consciousness to cloned bodies has made him rich and powerful. But power never lasts. You were chosen to lead a group of four cybernetic agents to topple Dangler’s rule. Mechanically, it’s a remake of Syndicate Wars rather than the original Syndicate game (the lead designer of Satellite Reign and Syndicate Wars is the same person – Mike Diskett) with the addition of stealth elements reminiscent of Commandos Behind Enemy Lines.\n\nThe Agents.\n\nThe first major difference, compared to the originals is that your agents are not identical. Each one is a different class of a field operative, with distinct skills which can be further upgraded, adding an RPG-like twist.\n\nThe Soldier is a walking tank. He can carry the most weapons and equipment, has the most hit points and offers purely combat oriented skillsets. Second is the Support, who works as a medic boasting useful support abilities such as the World Scan (for highlighting connections between cameras, gates, power sources, hackable terminals etc.) or the Team Stims which slows down time. The Hacker is responsible for controlling CCTV cameras, doors, gates and taking control of NPCs like civilians or soldiers. Or even call in armed drones to aid the team in firefights. The Assassin uses a monofilament sword to kill even the most powerful enemies with one swift blow without alerting other enemy combatants, bypass security checkpoints in thermoptic camo or zoom above their heads using zip lines scattered around the city.\n\nThe Setting.\n\nThe game is set in a big seamless city that takes cues from Blade Runner, featuring even the constant rain. Divided into four main districts, each with its own unique architecture and feel, it makes for an interesting cyberpunk setting. You are absolutely free to roam a given district, and later the whole city, as you see fit. Of course, there are places your agents will not be tolerated, often pointed out by your handler to undertake missions inr. These hot-spots are navigated entirely as you please: guns blazing chaos, full stealth infiltration, or murdering silently from the shadows. There is no set missions order, leaving you free to play as you choose, but the missions are not that varied and some of them (especially the ones that give you distinct wide bonuses such as slowing down CCTV cameras’ detection time) are identical in nature in every district. What salvages the situation though is the layout of each areas remains unique.\n\nGuns and R&D.\n\nThe arsenal at your disposal is varied. Throughout the game you will have access to dozens of different weapons from pistols to plasma cannons. Combined with auxiliary gear like force fields, medikits, grenades and body augmentations means a strong degree of customisation is available. New weapons, gear and augmentations are acquired through various missions. Some of them will be available as blueprints ready for immediate manufacture, some are prototypes which have to be researched first in order to produce more. Funds and scientists used to do this are almost literally lying on the streets of the city. To get funds flowing you hack ATMs scattered here and there and to get you lab stuff you use the World Scan ability to locate them among regular citizens (just drag the mouse over each of them to get to know who is who). This system works well and the only thing I found lacking about it is the fact that there is no graphical representation of the augmentation process.\n\nCombat and Stealth.\n\nCover plays an important role in Satellite Reign. In combat, it provides cover from incoming enemy fire,while, in stealth,d it hides your agents from enemy sight. It’s not foolproof - smaller pieces of cover can be destroyed by concentrated small arms fire or with explosives. Enemies themselves come in different shapes and sizes. Lowly grunts sport rifles and a bulletproof vests while power-armoured enforcers wield miniguns.  Giant four-legged walkers stalk battlefields, showering overkill. They react to your play style, taking cover or calling in reinforcements.\n\nMost of their actions are colour-coded with their flashlights – white is normal status, yellow for alert and red for hostile. Fire fights are enjoyable and frantic at times, sometimes putting you up against 10+ enemies at once. If your agents happen to fall in combat they can be revived by other agents but each revive decreases the window of rescue. If a fatality occurs your agents can be brought back to life at special beacons you activate in the city, which also act as fast travel waypoints. You have to remember though that each time your agent dies, they lose stat bonuses. Death is still bad.\n\nThe Graphics.\n\nSatellite Reign is a mix of colourful neons, commercials, holograms, clean stylised areas, industrial spaces and dirty little streets realised brilliantly on the Unreal engine. It all looks and feels right  Efforts have been made to ensure different corporations and organizations as well as enemy type each have their own look and style of armour to set them apart. There’s some criticism regarding your agent’s uniforms looking too bright but it does help them stand out of a crowded screen. The lack of free camera rotation is a bigger obstacle.\n\nConclusion.\n\nSatellite Reign is a worthy tribute to the Syndicate franchise and should be of interest to fans of tactical combat games. It leaves room for player improvisation, allowing several different tactics to find success in each objective. It’s a smart cyberpunk homage that’s worth checking out.","November 27, 2015","true","59.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","14","16","2","0"

You can rush base and kill everything you see and just run away from rest of enemies and they will forever forget your face. There should be either pause in game (because slow time is blurry and turtle speed is no fun) or option to set aggressiveness for your units to auto attack from cover without moving for example lvl 0 - hold fire , lvl 1 - shot nearest enemy not in cover, lvl 2 - shot nearest enemy.  Stealthy approach is feels like commandos and combat feels like cannon fodder. Enemies don't react to dead bodies or explosions only when you are nearby. They should increase security permanently and leave stationary guards when incidents occurred. In general its not very challenging for experienced player.

Ive never really been into doing reviews but this game I feel needs it.\n\nThe game over all does alot of things right in my opinion.  They mission system is diverse enough that you actually can spend the time to plan out how you wish to complete it.  I spent a good deal of my time locating zip lines, watching patrols, and looking for doors and cameras to hack before I ever even attempted to do the mission.  I was able to complete some of them without even firing a shot.\n\nCombat is quick and easy, but if you dont use your agents correctly you will very quickly find yourself respawning outside the mission area while your enemies reinforce.  Had to do that several times as I was to eager and tried to run and gun.\n\nAdvancing your agents is decent, could have more skills per agent, but as it is early access what is there is still a good mix.  In the future I hope there will be more advancement options.\n\nThe game really does require you to think instead of just saying here, watch some pretty flashing lights, read some dialouge and gratz you win.  Dont see this one being easily beaten.

Over 200 some odd hours later, I am going to go and shamelessly declare Satellite Reign as a Game of the Year contender. You wont be dissapointed.\n---------------------------\nHaving missed out on the original Syndicate games by Bullfrog, I was very excited to hear the original team was developing a spiritual sequel of sorts to the series. After occasionally monitoring their post Kickstarter development and hearing about the game on the controversial "Early Access" que on steam, I decided to take the plunge and purchase a full early copy of the game... I am glad I was not dissapointed.\n\nLet me first state that the game is VERY much still an unfinished Pre-Alpha, and warn that anyone expecting a fully polished product should wait. However if you are a tinkerer and don't mind spoiling the game a little for yourself, go ahead and spend that $30 dollars and get an early glimpse at a very promising game that is gearing up to be as immersive, deep and multi layered as any surprise hit or "Game of The Year" in its class as you can imagine.\n\nThis is my first review and first move in experiencing a game on a community level as it finishes and I will say I am very happy to have chosen this Neon Lathered Cyberpunk Beauty as the first "leap".

Imagine taking the 4 group real time strategy of SW and throwing in Deus Ex Human Revolution. Strange, I know, but it actually works. And works well. You can hack and cloak and probably do all sorts of other things that I've not discovered yet. And it looks beautiful.\n\nIt is a great game with a wonderful cyberpunk atmosphere. If you like Bladerunner you'll love the fact that in game it is always raining with the neon adverts adding to the environments.\n\nAt this _Early Access_ stage it is understandably rough round the edges, but other than one of the agents (I guess that's who they are, not just disgruntled members of the film actors guild) gaining the ability to teleport on top of a building without order I've not come across any serious bugs so far.\n\nAs far as I can tell there doesn't appear to be a shop to buy guns, and the ability to customise the four characters would be a nice idea as well. After the demise of a faceless bad guy via ozi(?!) there was the option to research an SMG via price chart which is a great throughback to SW. Though there was no alert to this, or the levelling up of the agents that I was aware of, I'm sure there will be in the finished product. Also while I dig the Tron inspired trenchcoats that they wear a variation in colour at least down the line would be good as well. When you start picking about the colour of a coat, you start to realise the game is pretty flipping good.\n\nThough all of the above may all be possible and I might just be being dense. At this _Early Access_ stage nothing is described particularly well, and why would it be? There are far more important things to deal with than messing around with detailed tutorials and colouring coats.\n\nSatellite Reign is great and it could be fantastic. As long as we can rain laser-bombs from satellites in the end product and build a Terminator with fire-proof skin, what could possibly go wrong?","January 17, 2015","true","16.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","2"

Admittedly I find early access difficult to support after a few bad experiences, I regret not buying this sooner!\n\nIf you're a fan of Syndicate (1993) and Syndicate Wars, you'll love this! The game has everything you'd want from a tactical squad game, researchable weapons, gear, augmentations, skills for each of the four classes. Tactical gameplay and most of all choice! Want to go the pacifist route, the ninja silent killer route, or just blow a hole in the front gate and mow down everything in your way... Why not a mix of them all!\n\nAll the classes are well defined and have their own benefits, the Support character can scan wire systems so Sec Cams can be taken offline, The hacker can take over systems or people, these are a few you've seen in the videos, I could tell you about many more cool skills, but its best you find these out yourself, some will make you have that warm feeling inside as you figure out cool new ways to Assassinate people or tactics that will make your squad a crack Commando team.\n\nI could go on for pages, about how the music is cool, the graphics are great and the neon really feels like Cyberpunk and Bladerunner. How some of the missions I've done have been tense chases to get the prototype weapon safe. Or just more about how this game nails the feeling of being in a living city. It has minor things that I'd love to see change, but this is due to resources, hopefully future titles will have more than weapons change on your characters, though every clone switch gives you a new look and colours can be set. The Augmentation screen is gone, while I miss it the game doesn't suffer for it, and the devs have said they wanted to add more content instead due to time limitations. I'm sure it will come back!\n\nOn top of the game, what I've seen are dedicated devs, I'm picky with devs because so many don't support their communities, 5Lives are a good team and really want to make this game great, they have mentioned about how extra features may hopefully make it post release. These guys are Great!\n\nTo close it off the game extras such as the Novel and Art book are great, I recommend anyone with a kindle read the Novel, its only 150 pages but is written very well with some interesting twists, it has the odd word out of place but doesn't distract too much.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough, enjoy it!","August 26, 2015","true","38.5"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

Most games these days don't come out with this much polish.  Yeah there are a few bugs, but far fewer than other games I have played lately.  The first thing to comment on is obvious: the visuals.  It is a gorgeous game and I love playing it with the lights off.  The colors and the details on max settings are so nice to look at.\n\nI have read people complaining about the combat and I have to agree to a point.  The agent AI could be better in regards to pathing and just sitting there when they are being shot at.  The enemy AI needs some improvement because they just run right towards you and stand on top of you and sometimes taking cover.  Once an enemy calls for back up, that's it.  There should only be so much back up in the area.  The game forces you to slow down and think about your surroundings.  You can still go in and kill as long as you are aware of where the other guards are because sound matters.\n\nI personally like the stealth mechanics.  Get a decked out infiltrator and you are good to go.  I enjoy the fact that I got him in almost to the goal and up to a zipline which nearly eletrocuted him.  I wasn't expecting that.  I had to sneak in my soldier so that he could find the power source and my infiltrator continued on to the goal.  Then I had to sneak them both out.  It was very rewarding when I did it wihout the loss of a single life.  You can't just run across a lot 30 ft from an enemy and get away with it.  They will see you.  Excellent.  I don't want to see their cone of sight.\n\nIt is right to compare this game to Syndicate and I remember it enough to be able to compare the two very well.  Syndicate was very easy.  It was a game that appealed to the lowest common denominator and there wasn't much strategy to it.  Satellite Reign requires more thought and planning which I love.  I am glad it isn't just a run and gun kind of game which some people seem to have expected.  It isn't an FPS game and it should never be.\n\nNot since Deux Ex: Human Revolutions has a game had me excited to come home from work and skip the gym to jump back in.  Yeah, it has been that long.  I love this game and I can't stop thinking about it when I'm not playing it.  Especially when trying to fall asleep.  It is obvious the amount of work that went into it.  Good job!

The idea behind Satellite Reign is that it's a spiritual successor to Bullfrog's classic Syndicate series. You have 4 agents that you control in this open-world RTS. You start with 3 (you have to rescue the Heavy guy) agents. While a lot of features are not in the current build, the fundamentals are there (a working combat system, decent AI, beautiful aesthetics, an open world) and it's enough to say that 5 Lives are on the right track to reviving what was considered a dead style of game.\n\nWhat shocks me is just how vast the city sandbox is, whilst I do expect 5 Lives to make a larger city for the full game, the city is already quite big and full of "life". Another little detail I thought was quite nice is how the characters stumble and react to getting shot, a character stumbled as I shot him something that we rarely see in this genre and it's just a small detail but regardless it's nice to see that for all that this pays homage to the originals it's a very modernised take on it.\n\nWhilst it's by no means perfect, and if you aren't fussed for Early Access I'm very unlikely to change your mind but I do recommend keeping an eye on this game if you love RTS', or even just the classic Syndicate games. This is the game you were looking for when EA announced Syndicate a couple of years back.","December 12, 2014","true","3.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

I was one of the original backers of it on Kickstarter and I am happy I was.\n\nThe graphics:performance ratio is decent enough.  The artstyle is a great choice, and implemented quite nicely.  There are moments when the atmosphere is very present. Especially with the music, and other audio noises in the game. The lighting is a great mechanic.\n\nI have a thing for cyber punk universes, and while this one isn't as well defined as Shadowrun, its closer to that of Blade Runner/Deus Ex as far as style. It does a good enough job, I am sure that the sequel will be more fleshed out. Story typical of most dystopian games as such. This one with a flavor of completely "privately owned & regulated market" society.\n\nOne thing I like about this game is choice, there are many different paths you can do, in any order you choose almost. Plus there are different ways you can do them.   The gameplay is fun, running around stealth is a blast. The firefights are intriguing, if even mostly streamlined.  Most of the abilities are warranted and useful.  The level distruction is fun.\n\nThe weapons and upgrades are pretty cool, but this is something I expect to see expanded further upon in 5 Lives Studio's next game like this, such as more explosives.  Some other things I would like to see in the successor are hacking billboards to promote propaganda... distraction focused gadgets... more in-doors gameplay... have vehicles play a larger role... perhaps a Co-op option for the campaign... better AI?\n\nOverall I say this game is great fun, a throw-back to games that were around when I was a child. It can use some improvements but its pretty solid as of now.  I haven't completed it, but I am a good 2/3rds through it, and if there is anything substantial I may edit my review, but if not I will leave it as is.\n\n5 Lives Studio definitely has my attention for their next game.\n","November 15, 2015","true","34.6"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","2"

If you're looking for something that will take you more than 3 hours to reach the end of, check back later.

Unlike those games, each of your characters has a specific role on the team (that will eventually have meat to them than at present), which gives some heft to the strategy elements and options you have for proceeding.  At the moment you really only have two paths fleshed out.  You can either smash your way through everything with brute force, or you can use your Hacker to break into things, disable them stealthily, or take control of someone and use them as a distraction/key where the opportunity presents itself.  From what I've read it looks likein the future you'll also have your Infiltrator as an option for slipping in, with the rest of your team presumably as backup if that fails.\n\nGraphically it looks like Syndicate Wars and Bladerunner had a baby (this is a positive).  The UI you access on the street is probably the only part I'd say needs to be thrown out and replaced.  It's nearly impossible to change which weapon is being wielded or make out the icons.  I'd rather have a small icon to remind me which unit is which (they're in a fixed order you can't change anyways) and a big icon to indicate whether or not they're shaking an SMG at passers-by.  The characters also need work... though it's likely they are just placeholders.\n\nAI is hit-or-miss at this point.  Some enemy behavior is actually pretty realistic, and your units do usually follow your orders.  There are some issues with not firing from cover at an enemy who is further behind the same cover you are, the team's Infiltrator occassionally running 3 feet from an enemy to show him the sniper rifle he's being shot with, and agents sometimes getting locked into shooting the same corpse/empty space despite your pleas for them to return fire at someone who's killing them.\n\nThe game really shines in letting you know there's direction.  The early missions showcase where the game might be heading.  In one mission, a jailbreak with multiple paths to success.  In another you're stealing tech to research it.  Along the way you might hack into some ATMs to fund your venture.  Then you rob or hack a bank, giving you a big score all at once or a slow, permanent flow of money that will eventually outweigh it.  Then you have to have your hacker hijack someone and use them as a key.\n\nAt this point I'd recommend people who like being playtesters and want to fund this thing into completion give it a try.  I'd also recommend it for fans of Syndicate, its expansions, and Syndicate Wars, because you'll probably want to have some input on the game.  People with older PCs should check back later.  Anyone else should probably wait on buying it; understand that right now you're looking at about 3 - 4 hours to run out of game, not counting crashes.","December 12, 2014","true","3.7"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

The concept is neat, a more free roam top down point and click with four unique heroes, a soldier, support,  hacker, and stealth operative. Each hero has unique abilities specific to their class, the support has passive aoe heal over time, the hacker can hack atms and hijack civilians to scope out areas, the soldier has a stoneskin ability which allows him to take massive damage, and the operative can stealth and sneak attack a single target. The missions are spread throughout the city which entail sneaking or shooting your way through heavily guarded facilities throughout the districts for various passive bonuses in the district and in some cases some upgradable gear to outfit your heroes. The majority of the missions also have an option to buy information which can give insight as well as bonuses in your favor.\n\nBeing that the game is in the early access phase, i wouldn't recomend paying for the game as joining in any testing phase for any game is not only a privelage to the player, I view it as a service to the gaming companies as well. Being that we arent employees for five live studios one cannot expect to be paid to do their work for them which lets face it, that is what we do in beta phases for games, but at least allow a smaller community to be able to test the game without having to buy into it.\n\nSattelite reign in its current state is filled with more bugs and incomplete objectives then most games typically have at this stage. I would think of it as more of a conceptual playtest demo thrown together to keep people satisfied with what they funded via kickstarter. Characters get stuck in the most random places, some of the missions are undefined in their explanations or downright impossible to complete, the auto pathing is horrendous, and the law system gets bugged at times to where your infamy never goes away in certain areas causing the cops to keep shooting you without being provoked or given reason.  Most of the features for the game are completely nonexistent, more specifically some of the mission rewards, data terminals which provide more insight into the wide array of city locations, and civilian descriptions which would make missions much less confusing. Most of the missions are more easily completed by shooting through them rather than sneaking, for which you do not gain any experience based rewards ruling out individual skills among the four heroes, useless.\n\nAll of this in mind, as previously stated, the game is Conceptually one of the better top down games ive seen, conceptually. I am severely interested in seing a more finalized rendition of the game and had a frustrating amount of fun in the game as is, despite the fact that it definately needs some drastic improvement. I wouldnt suggest buying it until the game is more complete.","January 30, 2015","true","39.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

Optimal play in combat requires reflexes I don't have, but fortunately most combat doesn't need to be optimal. Some design decisions are baffling - such as the way stims work and how 'fire at will' involves a-click and having your agents move out of cover. You also can't really lose until the last mission, which just bugs out if you 'lose'.\n\nThat said, the game is probably the most fun I've played all year. It's not replayable like Invisible Inc, but the shenanigans you can get up to are amazing, as are the explosions when you decide to go loud or get spotted. Hijacking makes a triumphant return from the original Syndicate series, and is more useful than ever. There's nothing quite like mind controlling a gangster to kill his own boss, then run through a military compound shooting out all the cameras so your team can infiltrate silently from the OTHER SIDE of the commotion. Throw in remote explosives, plasma cannons and the best grenades in ages and you have a winner.\n\nI enjoyed the original Syndicate but never really played it to completion. I never touched Syndicate Wars. I hated the Commandos series. Yet I love Satellite Reign.\n\nI'm really looking forward to a sequel that addresses the remaining issues and gives us more to play with.","August 31, 2015","true","27.8"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

It is played much like the syndicate game and has a pleasant 'X-Com' feel to it, but many design choices hinder this game in many ways.\n\nPROS:\n+Huge and beautiful cyberpunk multilayered city filled with lore that you can explore. Easily the most beautiful environment I've seen in any video-game.\n+Combat is fun enough, as should it be since it is the bread and butter of this game, even if it does lack quite a bit of content.\n+Many ways to approach the execution of many missions: do you want to kick the front door or try to sneak in, get what you need and bail?\n+Each agent feels different and specialized, with a progression system that, although not inovative in any way, doesn't take away from the game either in my opinion.\n+The agents skills all work together to bring a lot of pain to your enemies, making your 4-men squad really formidable force if you can tap into all of their potential. More of that on the Cons section.\n+The research is easily the best aspect of the game for me, since the game gives loot to you in the form of prototypes. That means that you will have to counter-engineer that sexy flamethrower before using it. Some players will find it annoying though.\n\nThe combat is, at first glance, great. You can feel the corporate espionage theme when you go after your mission's objective inside your enemies facilities, and the combat initially feels awesome, if a little clunky. But as soon as you leave the very early game, you start to see many things that could use some improvement or, in some cases, a complete rework, that were hidden due to the lack of challenge from the initial areas.\n\nCONS:\n-All 4 agents are controlled individually, requiring great speed with mouse and hotkeys controls from the player, not unlike games like star craft. However, hotkeys are also shared between many abilities, meaning that some skills and/or items can't be used reliably through the hotkeys.\n-Cover system is absolutely horrendous for the lack of reliable control you have over your units, making you lose ammo by shooting something that is hidden behind a huge wall and won't be getting out of its cover any time soon. Even if realistic, it increases exponentially the micromanagement needed to unnecessary levels.\n-Speaking about ammo, all the primary weapons can run out of it during combat. Again, due to lack of reliable control over your agents' aiming, you might run out of ammo on all your agents before taking down your opponents, effectively downgrading your force to pistols for the remainder of the mission, unless you have the Ammo Pack item.\n-Enemies can call for reinforcements. While good (and needed for the game's challenge) in itself, you may find yourself overrun from all sides, as enemies that are on the other side of a wall will keep calling for back up. That wouldn't be so bad if the next factor wouldn't come into play with it.\n-You can aggro enemies that are far away from your line of sight. Those enemies in turn will aggro more enemies that are out of your line of sight and then call for reinforcements, creating a huge domino effect that is more dependent on your luck than skill. If there aren't too many enemies in certain radius beyond your line of sight, than you will win. If there are, you will lose.\n-Weapons use the "Jo-Ken-Po" system, where one type of weapon beats one type of defense, but is horrible at passing through other types of defenses. Plasma weaponry, for example, has immense bonuses against armor, but can't even touch energy shields. The opposite is true for laser weapons, bonuses against shields, penalties against armor.\n-Talking about defenses, both shields and armor are literraly the same thing: more HP, the only difference being that shields are hit first, than armor, and than finally your health.\n-This next topic has been the subject of much discussion in the forums, but many of the problems that I had with this game would dissapear if this feature existed: tactical pause. While the Support agent has the stim packs ability, which slows down time considerably, that ability is dependant on too many factors to make it work as a real tactical pause: the support has to be alive, the support has to have stamina, and the skill has a lengthy cooldown for its purpose.\n\nIn short, this game does not try too much to please the players that hate micromanagement like me, while people that really loves RTS games but want something more low scale and/or cyberpunk might like this game. Additionaly, the weapons and defenses are really unimaginative and just feel like a copy paste of each other, just with different numbers instead of being something that allows the player to customise his experience.\n\nThis game is fun overall and has a really different feel to it since there is almost nothing cyberpunk-related in gaming these days, but it could be so much more with just some tweaking. 4-6/10 for those who want this type of game but with tactical pause dependiong on how crucial you feel the feature is for this types of games, and 7.5/10 for those with the skills to micromanage their agents. This game has a lot of potential though, and the devs seem to be listening, so if we have some luck, we might have a real gem here in the next months, hence the recommendation.","September 8, 2015","true","58.4"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

The car traffic system is buggy, pathfinding, especially with stairs and doors goes wonky, some data terminals don't work and most importantly, the save/ load system niether saves nor loads. So it says a lot that I'd still recommend this game. The city is wonderful, full of character and just begs to be explored. The gameplay feels right. You can storm the the gates or stealth your way in. Need a civilian to be distraction? That's possible, too. Crucially, it feels like an evolution of Syndicate - it nails the feel and then builds on it. In short if you love Syndicate, you'll adore this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bunrt/recommended/268870/","bunrt","[HTT] im wooser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bunrt/","182 products in account","Final verdict: A fun game brought down heavily through mechanical issues. With enough patches and fixes, it'd be a gem. For now, it's hard to go mad about but still quite decent.\n\nPlease note that this review is written while the game is still undergoing some development and you may be reading this after said patches and fixes are put in, making a lot of the complaints outdated. A multiplayer co-op mode is soon to released also.\n\n\nThe general gist of the game is you're a team of cyberpunks looking to take down an evil megacorp, as usual. It's realtime strategy with 4 characters all of whom must be controlled manually. There is a pause function in the form of a character skill that slows time to 90%, which you gain by levelling up - an option when starting a new game is to have this skill fully levelled from the start which I chose. This allows you to take your time and play the game with more strategy involved than running away a lot of getting blown up.\n\nOverall your goals are to sneak or shoot your way into a fortress, get to the well protected door at the end then get outta there. This is pretty much all you'll be doing the whole game, but well made level design and a multitude of ways to reach and escape from your destination is what keeps things from ever being repetitive.\n\nNow that the concept of the game is explained, I'll keep the rest of the review as simple bullet points:\n\nTHE GOOD:A pretty good 15-20 hours for the price. Quite simply, it was fun and there was quite a bit of it. This was with all side missions completed though some may take much longer to beat the game.\nEvery area has multiple approaches, no obstacles cannot be overcome so long as you use the right tools. Or you can pay your way through, at times.\nLooks very good, excellent implementation of cyberpunk aesthetics and mechanics into the world, decent worldbuilding through logs/breifings, though some item descriptions break immersion a little.\nNever got bored, always had fun infiltrating despite it seeming like it'd get reptitive to do constant heists.\nGood change of pace from purely turn-based similar games released within the past few years such as shadowrun, if you're on a cyberpunk run. The game however has a lot more similarities to ones made many, many years ago that people have been clamouring for more of.\nRespawning on death instead of reloading a save led to longer play sessions of hours at a time. Enemies respawn over time but total progress isnt lost such as blown up doors, though they also refresh on quit and reload. Keep in mind you may spawn a lot of patrols that then\nEnemy factions leading to infighting if you lead them to eachother is a nice touch, as are all the times you can hijack a turret or an enemy's head.\nLoot was always impactful when acquired, as were skills gained. It was nice to feel like I was becoming much more powerful, even if it did mean early on was way, way harder.\nTHE BAD:Poor pathfinding, often inputs are unresponsive and characters (though this effects enemies too, just as often) shoot at walls/floors or get stuck pathing. Characters would often either not follow commands given, or do dumb things like shooting at cover rather than from it, which is deadly with heavy weapons equipped.\nPoor AI in general, both player and enemies, leads to a lot of necessary micromanagement and ways to exploit. Namely with grenades and verticality. PC's will not automatically fire back or run away when fired upon, all 4 characters must be controlled manually.\nSub-60 FPS on-load, degrades over time with session, eventually becoming unplayable stuttering. Running on a GTX 970, i5 SSD system with latest drivers. Apparently this is a recent issue caused by a patch but sadly I had to deal with it the whole time.\nDifficulty curve in general out-of-balance due to avilability of gear, skills and upgrades being too low early on and massive late in the game. Enemies do become harder, but not smarter, and simply being able to heal/respawn-on-site or throw a grenade makes things massively easier. Stealth is necessary early on but later on you can go in guns blazing easily. Soldier abilities especially break the game, as do grenades as enemies don't respond to them very much.\nFor a long period in the middle of the game you'll have a lot of money with nothing to spend it on. Then right near the end of the game you get a ton of interesting new items that you can only use for about an hour, makes me wish for a new game+.\nNITPICKS:Stealth/pacifist achievements are currently given incorrectly on loading saves so no reason to attempt them legitimately unless you simply enjoy the playstyle.\nPause mode is strange as it slows the camera and is an ability reliant on energy and a single character being avilable. It is however very strong and makes the game much easier once you have healing items unlocked.\nSome parts repetitive, quests like laying down relay beacons or hacking ATMs. Rest of the game isn't however.\nXP/money gained over time rather than being a limited resource is weird, there are a lot of time-based costs unfitting to SP game. To clarify, you can farm XP just by sitting still while trespassing or killing patrols over and over, while money accumulates over time from hacked ATMs or in lump sums from missions or infiltrations. You can essentially idle in a good sneaking spot and come back to the game with a ton of levels and money. Don't do that though.\nSome missions did not give all listed rewards with no indication of how those rewards were lost. You can however expect to have missed information due to not paying for it in the briefing screen.\nNo character model customisation, gotta hope the guys you hijack and clone for better stats dont look ugly.\nEnding was... something...\n\nI like the game and won't turn anyone away from it if they're interested, but understand that it's far from flawless. Mostly in the technical sense. I look forward to seeing what the devs do from now on, whether this will get DLC, a sequel, or whether they'll put out another series. I'd also like to mention that for a 5 person team, this game is amazing.","May 16","true","19.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","3"

The game never really pulled off that cyberpunk feel but remained a good squad based RPG for the time.\n\nSatellite Reign is the same sort of game as Syndicate and it nails the Cyberpunk feel. The maps, the characters the text and corporations all just work and work well. They really make it feel like a Cyberpunk world in ways games like Shadow run totally failed to achieve.\n\nIt plays like an open world game, only it is actually a large level based game that you unlock new areas as you progress, all part of the same world map but definitely not open.\n\nStill it is about roaming around and choosing your next target your self. Which is the core of most open ended games.\n\nThe game play is fairly straight forward, break in to a company compound, steal money, prototypes etc, research them and upgrade your squad and do it all again. You can raid the same company twice if you like, the company seems to restock some of its loot over time but so far I have not gotten the rich rewards that I got after the first raid when revisiting the same company.\n\nAs you progress you unlock new areas of the city to explore and raid for loot and other valuables, doing missions, levelling up, adding skills to your squad of 4 men.\n\nAside from the slightly clunky interface which you do get use too, this game is a very good game.\n\nI cannot help but feel I am playing the original Syndicate again on the old Amiga, the difference being, Satelite Reign does a better job and because its new, it feels fresh and exciting.\n\nStrongly recommended.","October 17, 2015","true","23.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

Kind of like taking something like XCOM or the recent Shadowrun games and turning it real time. Maybe something like a cyberpunk infinity engine RPG.\n\nWell it's not that at all.\n\nSatellite Reign is a real time stealth strategy game with RPG leveling mechanics. In general, you do not want to get into firefights. Particularly early on, where you're more likely to get your units killed than anything else if you alert the enemies, alarms start blaring, and you decide to stand and fight.\n\nHell, the combat isn't even very good once you've got agents strong enough to just murder everything in sight like a squad of action movie heroes. The micromanagement it takes is quite cumbersome. In general, none of your units will target enemies without you specifically telling them to do so, and telling them to shoot someone outside of their line of sight often ends with your unit standing outside of cover. This means that if you want to send units around  the field taking up postions, you have to tell each agent individually their new target whenever an enemy goes down.\n\nFrankly, combat ends up being a matter of taking all of your agents and focusing fire on one enemy at a time, cover be damned, because frankly, I couldn't be arsed to deal with cover if my agents were just going to run into the open on their own if an enemy just happens to be standing in a slightly inconvenient spot.\n\nWhere the game shines is planning. Lots and lots of planning. Execution, too, of course. Before entering a hostile facility, I spent a lot of time scouting the exterior, trying to find the best path in. I would hijack one of the enemy units, and use it to scout out the entire enemy facility to figure out common patrol routes, camera postions, generator postions, locations of useful vents, etc.. While doing this I planned where my agents would enter, what path they would take to the target, and what path they would use to excape. If all went well, there would be minimal combat.\n\nComing up with a plan and excuting it flawlessly was extremely gratifying. Even when my plans failed, it was a lot of fun trying to figure out how to get my agents out alive (early to mid game anyway, in the endgame I just shot everything if I got caught).\n\n\nThere's a lot to love about Satellite Reign. It's a fantastic isometric stealth strategy game set in a gorgeous cyberpunk world. It's a very easy game to recommend. Just don't buy it expecting a deep combat tactics experience, because you won't find that here.","December 31, 2015","true","40.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The game's looks are impressive and the gameplay whilst a little repetitive is engaging enough to draw you in for hours at a time. It has to be said, this isn't a quick game and does require some time investment to get the most out of it. It's also not a flawless experience where at times agents can get stuck in doors or their pathing leaves little to be desired as they try to enter restricted areas rather than going around - so some baby sitting is required at times. Sadly the removal of vehicles which were present in the earlier builds slows the pacing down a bit, making navigation a little tiresome, although the fast travel and no loading between areas makes up for it in many ways. As a game for action strategy fans, this is well worth checking out due to its engrossing structure and fine presentation. There's a lot of fun to be had here for those with time and patience, although if anything, the game's lush visuals alone are worth the price of entry.\n","August 20, 2015","true","46.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

As they level up, you get points to unlock or upgrade class-specific abilities.  You take on missions which (for the most part)  involve infiltrating complex "fotresses" (essentially) with the main objective to be to reach a door.  This is made complicated by the need to be stealthy - especially in early game.  Get spotted, and reinforcements will come to flush you out.  Missions can also involve escort missions, finding crates in protected areas, and a few others.\n\nThere is also a research system. On missions, you will be stealing prototypes of weapons, augments (think Deus Ex), and Gear.  You need to spend money researching the prototype to be able to build multiple of them for your squad. So the loop is get prototype->research it->buy at least 2 of them.  Once bought, you can swap in any purchased items for any character.\n\nPros:\n- Fun open world. It feels like a real place.\n- Beautiful\n- Good progression systems.\n- Challanging gameplay. The objective may be clear, but getting there is a fun experiment.\n- Each character has their own unique purpose.\n- Lots of gear, weapons, items.\n- Everyone dying on a missions doesnt mean game over. You keep your xp. You just respawn and try again (unless playing ironman).\n\nCons:\n- It might be a bit slow paced for those looking for an action game.\n- Can feel a little repetitive.  This is partially countered by new gear that makes doing similar things easier/more exciting/differently.\n- Not much if the idea fits your tastes.\n- (MAY BE A NEG) - Your soldiers wont lift a hand without you telling them to.\n\nNeutral:\n- Enemy AI tends to give up kinda easy. This ends up being a positive, because otherwise the game would be stupidly hard. They pursue you enough to make it a challange.\n-It would be rather easy to almost ignore the upgrade and research system.  For better or worse.  If you do research and such, there is a TON to research so having some direction (when you do) is necessary.\n\nPretty fun. Not without its flaws, but they didnt prevent me from playing the game or want me to stop playing.","April 3","true","35.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I helped kickstart this game!). While the game itself is not perfect, I definitely recommend it.\n\nFirst, I'll start with what it's not. SR is not Syndicate Wars 3.0. It's strange how a game can share so much in common with spiritual ancestors but play so differently.  At least as far as I play it, and from the options the devs give you, SR is much more about stealth, tactics, and planning, than SW ever was. You have access to Zip-lines, Vents, back doors, cloaks, and instead of an area based persuadatron you can target and hack drones, bots, and enemies/npcs at a cost of a % of your energy regeneration. Dead enemies don't drop weapons though so you can't acquire technology that way. I think it is definitely possible to play "guns blazing" but I haven't had a lot of success going in hard yet.\n\nOnce you hack an enemy or npc, you can take control of that unit, and issue orders directly as part of your squad. For instance: I was faced with needing to access three security override terminals in succession to unlock a facility door. I tried repeatedly to get my hacker to each terminal, but there were simply too many patrolling guards, and cameras. At some point I hacked a nearby patrolling guard when he was out by himself (herself?) and sent them off to explore and provide visiblity beyond the range of my support agent's scanner. Hacked guards can go through secure doors, and more on a whim than anything I wondered if they could also access security override terminals. Well yes, yes, they can. My hacked guard obediently accessed all three terminals, allowing me access to the facility via a short run across the street. Turns out hacked drones and guards can access any terminal or object that does not require a skill to use or can be force used. Including Ziplines and Vents.\n\nSo onto the bad:\n\nI get twitching in firefights, what I really want is a way to pause the game to issue targetting commands more easily. Not being able to do this makes the game feel clunky and frustrating at times due to the precision required to shift cover, flank, and use abilities quickly. That's about the only bad thing game-play wise.\n\nI have experienced a couple of bugs:\n\n- In Grid as I was approaching the bank, CPU spiked and stayed up until I restarted the game. This only happened once in about 10 hours of play\n\n- A number of times a notification in red popped up with a null reference exception relating to spawning things. Importantly this did not crash the game or cause any other issues.\n\n- At one point a car got into a loop at an intersection and just sat there doing doughnuts permanently\n\n- NPC police patrol into zones they are not allowed in (Dracogenics compounds, Eternal compounds) and get massacred. This happens occasionally\n\n- NPC guards spawned due to a camera being shot out sometimes end up just standing beneath the camera staring at it (until you sneak up and execute them).\n\nThe 'set up' ability is a little clunky and interferes with drawing and holstering weapons, needing to click repeatedly after disabling the ability to get the character to put their gun away (also ignores the key binding for it).\n\nAll in all shaping up to be a very solid offering and definitely an enjoyable game.","August 8, 2015","true","34.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I would understand if my team was running around but if they are ducked down in a dark area then even a guard behind them should need to get very close to detect them, especially in the early parts of the game when you are learning how the game works. As there is no way to save the game during a mission they do need to be made easier.\n\nI think there needs to be  a difficulty level setting for those players who want the play-die-repeat challenge and those players who want to play for the story line.

As the developers are an indie studio I do wonder how much time they have put into balancing and the designers have been playing this game for well over a year now and will get very good at it and may have balanced the game so they find it a chalange.

As there is no way to save the game during a mission they do need to be made easier.\n\nI think there needs to be  a difficulty level setting for those players who want the play-die-repeat challenge and those players who want to play for the story line. Currently the game is just too frustrating for the later type of players.\n\nIf you like to complete games and go through the entire story-line prepared to get frustrated with the game and be prepared to put in a lot of hours. If you are old enough to remember the original Syndicate you probably have your own kids by now and will find you just don't have the spare time this game requires.\n\nThe balancing issue may get fixed but then again may not. As the developers are an indie studio I do wonder how much time they have put into balancing and the designers have been playing this game for well over a year now and will get very good at it and may have balanced the game so they find it a chalange. Hopefully they will be able to put in the time required to balance the game for us mere mortals.","August 23, 2015","true","20.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

There's a big cyberpunk city to explore and plenty of missions to complete, plus a bunch of stuff to do during the downtime like assimilating new recruits, hacking ATMs for funds and researching new upgrades and weapons for your guys.\n\nThough there's a lot to do, there are a few problems with the above which make the game bland or frustrating at times.  All of the best toys can't be researched until near the end of the game (read: you probably won't get a chance to use the rocket launcher) and the cloning system, while an interesting plot device, takes away from the tension of being behind enemy lines by making all of your men disposable.\n\nThe lack of variety in the missions can make them kind of a grind. Steal this, hack this, assasinate them... without a meaty plot, it all blends into an indistinguishable mush after awhile. The difficulty curve is way off as well, meaning that while you'll initially be struggling to complete missions, by the end you'll be so OP that you can march in anywhere with guns blazing. There's less incentive to think up clever tactics when you can use the same method every single time and succeed, which sells the game's decent tactical options short.\n\nEven taking all of that into account, I must say that I really enjoyed this game a lot. There's something distinctly satisfying about using a group of brainwashed soldiers to create a distraction or sneaking your Infiltrator in and out of a compound unnoticed. The class-specific skills, when levelled up, add some nice options for sneaking in your entire team, if need be. Or if you prefer brute force, there are dozens of weapons, implants and upgrades to choose from, so you'll never be short of options when fine-tuning your team.\n\nLastly, the art style is absolutely gorgeous. The perpetual rain on the neon-soaked streets is both soothing and ominous and the designs for the various denizens you'll encounter are just fantastic.\n\nAs a sidenote, the ending is insane. Not good insane or bad insane, just insane. Honestly, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a plot twist before which has made me so confused about whether to feel shocked or furious. Well played, 5 Lives, well played.\n\nNot without its flaws but, in my opinion, a worthy spiritual successor to Syndicate.","September 12, 2015","true","26.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

A little thing such as being unable to attack the guard in the tutorial bit because I got my agent deselected and I didn't understood why he would response to my commands anymore. Also the "suspicious" sub-system could do with a little more explaining.\n\nAs for playing, it feels open-worldy to me. There is a big city, divided in districts which you need to unlock. Then there are missions, some of which are optional and others that are story missions. It appears that doing optional missions will give you and advantage.\nThe city has a good atmosphere, there are a lot of people walking around and cars driving.\n\nRight now I've just completed the beacons mission, which will give you more optional missions as a result and will give you a nice walk around the first district.\nAnd there seems to be lots to do.","August 28, 2015","true","11.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

I am glad this kind of game exist and I hope to see more like it, but it definitely needs some work done. I was hoping this game would be similar to Shadowrun. It is not. The setting of this game is similar to Shadowrun (i.e. cyber-punk anarchist anti-corrupt government/corporation), minus the magic. However, the missions are less defined and basically the same. The missions are all about getting to a restricted location, going in a building, and getting out. Overall I am not bummed I bought it, but I am basically playing it just to finish it.\n\nPros\n•	Visually beautiful from the environment to the characters.\n•	Customizable characters\n•	Interesting story environment (i.e. futuristic cyber-punk)\n•	Living environment. People are walking around and react to your actions. For example, if you kill a random person people will flee. If they see you taking control of someone’s mind they run in fear. Cars stop if you walk in front of them.\n•	Open world exploration and fun.\n\nCons\n•	Missions are basically the same. “Run to X location, which is a restricted zone, stay hidden or shoot your way through, get into building (which equates to stealing information), then get out so you can save the game.”\n•	Punished for changing characters, even from beginning. If you change your character class you automatically lose one skill point on all your skills. Therefore, even though you can change your skills there is serious motivation not to do it. So if you want to make all your characters the same, say you want to make them all soldiers to shoot your way through a mission, your characters are weakened for it.\n•	Team-AI are essentially non-reactive. You really need to micro-manage your team. If you don’t tell them to shoot, they will just take stand in the open taking shots. This game would benefit from either turn-based combat or at least a pause feature.\n•	Can only save when all of your team are in a save points. Normally this wouldn’t be a problem but when characters bug out and fall through the map you have to load the game from an earlier save point.\n•	Certain features don’t seem to save. For examples, I was trying to get an achievement for shooting all the cameras in a district. However, every time I load a game the cameras are back. I can’t figure out why it won’t save.\n","April 10","true","6.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I had the Playstation version and would sit in my bedroom for days exploring the city blocks and trying to find hidden items.\n\nLooking past the current limitations of the Alpha release, what we should end up with at the end of Beta is a gloriously cybergoth cityscape with a multitude of options as to how to take on each scenario.\n\nThat's the real strengh of the new class system. It gives you a flexible tool set to play the game your way. That's the sort of gameplay you find in Half Life 2 or Skyrim and it should make for a very replayable experience.\n\nI'm personally having a ball creating mayhem in the district that's been released so far.

At the moment damage is repaired after a period of time.\n\nMore random events... to breath life into the cities population...\n\nRecommended buy... but if you're not as crazy as me you may want to wait until Beta to pick this up as its still not very well optimised and frame rate drops are common right now.","January 2, 2015","true","37.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The gameplay is fun and unquestionably worth the price of admission (especially on sale). Nevertheless, there are some negative aspects worth noting:\n\n- Pathfinding system breaks regularly. Breaking your commands into multiple stages via shift-clicking does not help; your agents (and even the AI) will regularly get stuck on walls and twirl around in circles.\n\n- Agents sometimes require inconvenient amounts of micromanagement. For example, there is no proper "fire at will" command, and agents will stand still until you explicitly instruct them to attack. There is a time dilation-type skill (Team Stims) which helps mitigate this somewhat by turning the game into turn-based lite.\n\n- You will quickly realize that the city, while atmospheric and well-crafted, is simply a facade and filler between the restricted compounds that make up the rest of the game. It feels like some opportunity was wasted to give the city more life. E.g., the majority of objectives are given to you as soon as you enter a city quadrant for the first time, instead of say, distributing questgivers throughout the city and giving the player more reason to explore.\n\n- There's a narrow period of equilibrium in the game's difficulty where your agents' equipment and skills (and your own skills) match up with the challenges the game presents you, and each agent brings something unique to the table. But, eventually (like, after all your agents are able to cloak and hack), you'll pretty much be able to steamroll through the zones even with a single agent.\n\n\nNevertheless, definitely worth picking up! I highly recommend listening to the Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon soundtrack while playing.","February 9","true","34.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

No competing factions to worry about along with your target its just you VS the security forces.  Every mission objective is behind a door you have to get in and then get out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nitirat/recommended/268870/","nitirat","Nitirat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nitirat/","252 products in account","I kickstarted Satellite Reign because I am a huge fan of the Syndicate games by Bullfrog, especially Syndicate Wars. Satellite Reign is the spiritual third game in the series, as anyone who has played the first two can see, as well as the fact that Peter Molyneux's gave his blessing to the making of this game.\n\nIf you haven't played the first two Syndicate games, go and play them! They are brilliant. But seriously, if you haven't, the game is set in a dystopian future, where the world and society are run by large corporations. You play a "business executive" in a shadowy corporation who has arisen to topple the current world order. Fairly generic in terms of plot, but I like how this is delivered in-game due to the fact that the world is continuous. In the old syndicate games, you would go to a central "command hub" to choose your next mission, conduct research, build weapons and gear and equip your team etc. But in Satellite Reign you never leave the world. The menu brings up your missions, research, equipment and so on, but when you leave the menu you're still in the world, which I think is a great feature. You control, from a 3-D isometric viewpoint, a team of four agents, each with a specific role and skillset:\n\nThe soldier specialises in combat, mainly in tanking, but also has a useful skill called "hardwire", which allows him to hack certain terminals in the game to give the squad an advantage. Of course, he also has offensive soldier-y abilities, like grenades and "rage" to temporarily increase damage.\nThe support provides your team with a myriad of ways to improve, from increasing health and health regen to distributing stims to them for use in combat to slow time to a crawl, as well as acting as medic when necessary. They also have a "world scan" ability, which shows you various things: the background electronics of the world (so you know which power terminal to disable in order to take down those security cameras) or citizens of note (researchers to bribe or assassination targets to, well, assassinate).\nThe hacker not only hacks computers, he can syphon money from atms dotted around the city, as well as hack people to fight for your cause. Yes, hack people. It's the future, everyone has microchips in their heads, of course. But hacking a person makes them fight for you, but they can also be sent back to your main base to be used a clone. More on that later.\nThe assassin is a sneaky stealth character who's a mean shot with a sniper rifle. He can use a melée strike, but this doesn't scale well with the game at the moment. He can also learn to become a thief, boosting funds if you send him in to raid a facility, or an infiltrator, allowing him to cloak for longer, use ziplines with ease and climb through ventilation shafts.\n\nThere's more to each class but I don't want to give everything away. You are given assignments in each part of the city you need to complete in order to improve your agents skill levels, cashflow and research and development. You can complete the missions with stealth or by just arming to the teeth and charging in, guns blazing. If you need to reduce the heat, hit a security facility to reduce the enemies ability to call in back-up. If you need funds, hit a bank. Additionally, you need to hit certain targets with specific agents to reap a reward. The bank is a good example: if you get a soldier in, you get a lump sum of cash. If you get a hacker in, you increase the amount you syphon from the atms by a certain amount, increasing profits on a long-term basis.\n\nEquipping your team is one of the main driving forces of the game. You start with uzi submachine guns and a basic pistol, no gear, no augments and only a couple of skills. Raiding other corporations gives you access to prototypes and blueprints, which you can give to your RnD department so that you can build them yourself. The guns fire one of three types of ammunition: ballistic, laser and plasma, each of which is more effective against flesh, shields and armour respectively. You can have a pistol and a main weapon on each member of the team; the pistols have unlimited ammo.\n\nGear is equipped on your team and ranges from drone controllers (allowing an agent have a drone following him around) to stealth generators (so that everyone, not just the assassin, can cloak) to personal shields to medkits and more.\n\nAugments are implants, and each team member can have one in each of the following slots: head, body, arms and legs. You can increase agents' stats, as well as give them immunity to poison or even put a self-destruct mechanism to make them a human (well, cyborg) bomb.\n\nThere are bad points though. The AI, enemy and friendly, is bit hit and miss. The camera angles are somtimes unhelpful. It can be a bit overwhelming choosing what to do first. Sometimes guards have supervision, seeing a "hidden" agent from two miles away through three walls, while sometimes they ignore a friendly drone exploding right in front of them as I shoot it with a silenced weapon. But overall, I love Satellite Reign. They've done Syndicate proud so far, I'd say. I particularly enjoy instigating a fight between the different factions then hiding and watching the carnage. This might be a bug; I thought everyone else was united against me, but oh well :)","April 9","true","43.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I'm not sure there is quite enough meat on the bone for the price, but then there are economies of scale in videogame development.  (my hour count is inflated by my tendancy to fall asleep at random times and places)\n\nIt's more about strategy then execution - you have a number of toolboxes with disparate and overlapping parts.\nEach agent has their own skills, and then there are a weapons, gear, and augments with their own effects.  I found my strategy evolving with each new skill, augment, or gear option.  It also pays to look over your target areas - plan your path of entry and exit.\n\nBecause it is a game of strategy, I don't really want to tell anyone "how to play" - figuring that out is the game.\n\nBut there are some frequent complaints that I want to address.\n\n"No pause"  There is a pause - it's a skill the support gets.  It's not mandatory, and I never made much use of it, but if you find yourself wanting the ability to stop time and survey the situation - invest in the stim skill.\n\n"The only way to get money is to wait" Money is a thing you can prioritize strategically.  I would suggest grabbing all the relays when you get to a new area and then carefully look through your available targets.\n\n"Syndicate wasn't about stealth..." The game doesn't have to be about stealth.  Initially your options are limited, and you have to work with the tools you have, but again - look at your targets and the available awards.  Look at the skills you have available to invest in.  If you don't have the tools you want - acquire them.  You can go stealth, you can mix stealth and combat ability, you can build a murder squad that slaughters all that stands before them and then salts the earth.\n\n"My dudes just stand there and get shot to death" Yeah.  I would appreciate a 'defend position' command or Fire-at-will toggle.  There is an attack-move command, logically defend is just attack-move without the movement.  I would love to be able to plant an agent or 2 in cover to create a distraction while I moved in on some other objective.\n\nThere isn't much story, and what is there isn't very interesting.\n\n***slight non-specific spoiler***\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ending is also really dumb, not mass effect 3 kill-your-enthusiasm-for-the-franchise dumb, but somewhat dumb.  Mostly the song.  Apologies to whatever band that is, they're probably friends with the lead programmer or something, I'm sure you're great people.

I bought the early access earlier this year, and though I enjoyed it, I stopped playing so the game would feel "fresh" when it launched. I started playing again early this week, and just finished it today.\n\nThe environment is very immersive and dynamic. Most of the terrain is destructable, much to my surprise. I found out on accident when using a short barricade as cover under heavy gunfire - so that was fun and welcome.\n\nPros:\n\n-The gameplay is only as repetitive as you make it. You're at liberty to sneak, hack, or blast your way through to an objective. All of which are fun.\n-It's as story heavy as you want. While just crusing through the gameplay won't yield much in story, if you take the time to enjoy the game you learn more about the background of various NPC's and events that are happening or have happenned.\n- The entire game immerses you in a Cyberpunk setting. In game visuals, music, and sounds don't leave room for gray area. There's no doubt about the setting your playing in. It's not just another sci-fi game. It's Cyberpunk. Even the menu UI's immerse you into this genre.\n- Funny easter eggs refferencing other media across science fiction, most of which inspired the cyberpunk genre.\n-Very customizable characters. Many comibinations of equipment provide for almost limitless possibilities - this is only limitted by each of your party members classes, but even then not limitted to the point where a player feels confined to predetermined roles.\n-The autosave helped a lot. I have a little boy who is very curious about computer buttons who nearly cost me a few hours of progres, bless his heart.\n\nCons:\n- Balance in character advancement. For the first 70% of the game, character advancement sort of trickles in terms of acquiring gear. During the last leg of the game, characters start advancing by leaps and bounds, but it takes considerable time and resources to achieve this equipment - sometimes forcing the player to "idle" for no other reason to acquire  end game equipment. It's only my first playthrough, so maybe I've missed something in the proccess. (I'm also not a big fan of reading guides on my first playthrough in a game, I like flying blind)\n\n- Pathing and movement functions flawlessly 99% of the time. The last 1% of the time a mobile might get stuck on a corner of a static object. This proved to get a little annoying when I absolutely needed one of my agents to move in a very precise way at a very precise time. This wasn't unique to PC's, but also NPC's. Though helpful in ensuring an easy kill, it wasn't as fun or rewarding as besting an unimpeded mobile. It would have been nice if there was some sort of course correction implemented. This was most frustrating when a vital NPC would get stuck inside a static mesh, or in a door transition.\n\n- The game might be too short. I think I'm only saying this because I really, really, enjoyed the game and I didn't want it to end.\n\nPersonal Gripes:\n\nWhile I know the kickstarter didn't reach it's multiplayer stretch goal, I'd looooove a multiplayer function. Syndicate multiplayer was one of my favorite multiplayer experiences, and I think it could only be improved on in Satellite Reign. I'd even be willing to back an expansion that only offered a multiplayer function. Please 5Lives, consider this.\n\n","September 12, 2015","true","83.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

What a game! Just finished it and had a blast.\n\nI won't talk about syndicate, although I was a huge fan. This game takes Syndicate to a whole new level. You walk around the city carrying out missions. Admittedly the things you can do in the city is limited but that is not really a problem, because the game is strong in where it counts. The Missions. There are so many ways to pull off a mission... What you will do depends on your play style.  Each base you raid is well thought off and how you upgrade your agents determine which paths are open to you.\n\nSpeaking of agents, there are tons of skills, augments, gear, and weapons to customize your team to fit your playstyle. I invested a lot of points on the hacker and the hijacked soldiers of rival corporations provided me with pretty strong clones to base my agents off.\n\nI have seen in places that the story was not all that enticing. I think it was not so much the scenario but its presentation that made it inaccessible. I like reading, thus finding and reading every last log entry/mission dossier was something I enjoyed. Still not every one may bother and only the main mission has VO. I had an idea what was going on since I read every last line, still the surprise ending caught me by surprise...

Enemies and cameras have a cone of vision shown by lights they use but it does not reflect the actual cone. Also sometimes when you order a stealth kill your character will not do it - just because.\n\nAlso it's weird that killing a regular enemy grants you few times more experience than completing a mission. So in the end the game pretty much forces you to use stealth and to stealth-kill everyone you meet. The experience for kills is not divinded among the team as far as I can see, so you end up sending you hacker alone in the enemy teritory to pull some headshots and thus get the exp needed to develop your hacking skills (hacking does not grant you exp or it's so small that not noticable).\n\nAI is broken both for your characters and NCPs - sometimes they spin in place, freeze or start shooting at walls rather than go round the corner before shooting.\n\nI find the UI cluttered and not clear, especially inventory, map and quest log screens - lots of unnecessary clicking and vague descriptions (like you have a description of an item but no items are selected - so what does it describe?). It's also not helpful that you don't know which missions are main line and which are side quests. No indication to mission difficulty make it really hard to pick something at the start as you keep hitting walls everywhere. Also it would seem there is no plot in the game? Map is barely readable for me as well.\n\nOn the good side though, I like the visuals and a general atmosphere of the game. Soundtrack is also very good and fits perfectly with the game. It has a number of interesting mechanics like research and cloning but it takes a while to figure out how they work.\n\nIf they at least fix combat / stealth and AI, I'll be happy to get back to it and give it a go one more time.","November 29, 2015","false","4.2"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","0"

Instead you're thrown into an open cyberpunk world complete with feuding mega corporations and Blade Runner inspired sets..\n\nYou have great freedom in this game and what you do from there is up to you: you can do missions (in whatever order you choose) or just fool around the four huge city districts. You can also choose how to upgrade your team (be it skills, gear, weapons or clones).\n\nHow you go about your business is also up to you... you can break into huge fortresses by force or use hacking and stealth skills to do it totally unnoticed.

When I heard during the KS that someone is going to re-create the Syndicate...or better...create game that would look like, feellike and play like Syndicate, I was like...Whoy. Shut up and take my money!\nWaiting for the game, waiting for every new piece of information, backer update etdc...I was patient. When beta was out, Ive tried a few minutes, maybe hours, and thought...well this is looking good, Ill wait for the final. And once final was out...I have 71 hours in the game now, if I can trust Steam, and it was time of pure pleasure and fun. The game didnt try to amuse me. It allowed me to amuse myself. Playground and toys are all at players disposal, the way he chooses to use them is up to us. I was wandering around those four districts, and after finishing nicely prepared missioopns I have repeatedly infiltrated oponent bases, making fun of those, dehonesting them, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ them in their houses and in their most private moments.\nBecause that is what the game feels like. It is terrible, brutal and inhuman/transhuma/posthuman world, where you can sntch mans body and puppetmaster him to the grave, and once he is of no use, you throw him away. Bussiness is build on this, religion is built on this, and possibly even immortality of those in power. And you are nothinhg like savior of the world. To compete those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, you act exactly the same way, doing whatever it takes to get the job done. Syndicate was mess. This is ultra. One can sy, that the game lacks the blood...I say it doesnt need it. Plasma burns dont bleed.\nVariety of playstyles is IMO overhelmming. From silent individual infiltration, well coordinated team operation to heavy weapons assault with rockets and plasmaballs flying everywhere. Silencers, Katanas, machine guns, laser minigiuns, suicidal bombers...hell it is a ride to hgell and back again. Multiple times.\nI certeinly hope 5 Lives take this as a start to continue in the same...or better...kind of production to the future. Because the game is simply brilliant.

First play-session ended up in 7 hours straight and that rarely ever happens. Despite being realtime, once this game gets started it very much has this "one more turn" feel to it. Although in this instance I should perhaps rather put it as "one more try," after your break-in attempt is brutally smashed by overestimating your own ego.\n\nIt is a little overwhelming at first, but I really recommend just cutting loose and experimenting. While you're still just starting up, you can really only gain through trial and error (unless you're the kind of person who thinks that "no bonus" is a penalty).\n\nEDIT: Looking back at this game is weird, I never actually completed it. While I did state that the mechanics are great, they're also very simple and they do not really evolve as the game goes on. After you've played the first quarter of the game you've practically tried everything already. If you love it so much that you feel like you can keep doing that four times longer than what you've already played, then I suppose you can get yourself to complete it. But unfortunately this game feels like it is too "stretched out" for its own good. Either it needs new mechanics to be procedurally implemented into the existing environment, or the whole experience needs to be shrunk into a much smaller gamespace.\n\nI'd still recommend this game to people who REALLY like the cyberpunk setting, or are fans of the original Syndicate games that have clearly inspired these. The ambience and nostalgia might be enough to carry you through, but unfortunately this was not the case in my own unfinished playthrough.","August 30, 2015","true","21.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

That needed to be said so you can understand the full context of the following: it is totally worth it.  This is a great game that I just sit down and sink hours into.  The open world is there for you to explore and has enough to keep you busy and engaged without eventually feeling mundane.  The skills and tools your agents have offer a variety of possible solutions to your various challenges (although some are easier than others).  Additionally, using informants doesn't feel like a cheat so much as proper heist planning: casing the joint, greasing a few palms, and getting insight into who has the actually run on the vault.\n\nAlso, wIth the open world with open ended solutions the developers made a great choice: death of your agents is not the end nor an unbearable setback.  It's problematic and costs you time, XP, and/or money but it's not crippeling.  Agent resurrection is always available, new clones can be acquired, and passive syphoning of ATMs for cash allows you to make up for mistakes or ops that did not go as planned. This encourages the experimentation a game like this needs to enable while still keeping a steady difficulty curve.\n\nAll I can say is this game is very fun and doesn't straight jacket you while still feeling all proper and cyberpunk.  The gameplay experience is worth the rough edges and I eagerly look forward to every update.

I don't even remember what level I backed at (probably $50?). So a little disclosure that this review is biased.\n\nAnyway, the tl;dr is that the game has potential, but it's not especially fun in its current stage.\n\nThe longer review is that, in the state it is right now, the game isn't very fun. It's not especially buggy - I had a few collision problems and got stuck once, but that's also called "any given session of Skyrim" so it's not something to go crazy about on a pre-Alpha.\n\nThe big issue is that so many systems are not yet implemented that it's hard to get a real feel for how the game really will be. Plus, since the agents all start out effectively at level 1, with no points in any but their core abilities, I can't really play with any special abilities or get a feel for what makes the classes different outside of appearance and a little gimmick. Combat is just pointless at this stage - my guys get torn apart, even in cover, which might suggest a balance issue as well. The interface is messy and the fonts are too small, making it hard to read, and, though I have lots of missions available I wind up very confused as to where to go and what do.\n\nBut, again, it's a pre-Alpha. This is effectively working code, and nothing more. It's not until Beta that you have everything implemented, so it'll be a while until I get to play "Satellite Reign." What I have right now is just the barebones of what will one be that game.\n\nThe potential is there, though.\n\nFirstly, the graphics look great, though the game isn't optimized at the least and runs like crap, though my computer is fairly decent (I run most modern games on max settings). The city map oozes detail and is both reminiscent of Syndicate AND very, very Cyberpunk. Just wandering around looking at things is nice.\n\nNext, the missions are varied and usually have multiple ways to complete them, including mulitple site entrances, hackable terminals, and even side missions that make completing the main missions easier; for instance, one side mission has me suborning a cyber-clinic to hack enemy agent implants, thus making combat easier across the board. Another has me contacting an info dealer which leads to better intel on other missions. This means you've got a lot of flexibility in how to do things. Or you can just run and gun.\n\nThe Combat, at this stage, feels unbalanced and my agents are very weak. However, it's got potential. The cover system is very organic, resembling a real-time X-Com: Enemy Unknown, and watching firefights unfold is impressive. The enemies seems dumb as dirt right now, but hopefully that will be improved. In any case, they are smart enough to take cover and call for reinforcements, and the game incorporates using hacking to shut that nonsense down, so, as with eveything else, the potential is there.\n\nI can't tell much about the rest of the game, but what I played feels like a decent taste of things to come.\n\nSo, would I recommend you BUY it? No, not at this stage.\nHowever, I DO recommend that, if you love Syndicate, Cyberpunk, or, heck, X-Com and other top-down tactical games, following Satellite Reign and picking it up when it hits Beta or goes Gold.","December 17, 2014","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Satellite Reign is a worthy successor to the first game.\n\nIt takes the idea of the original Syndicate and expands upon it. Instead of 4 identical agents, they have roles: Soldier, for carrying the big guns, mitigating damage and "hardwiring", Support for healing, buffing and debuffing, Hacker for, well, hacking, and Infiltrator for getting silent kills or getting into restricted areas without being seen.\n\nIt's fully open world, unlike Syndicate which had separate maps, this game takes place in one large city with different sectors. All research and equipping is done on the fly. The real joy with this is that you can be walking down the street and come across a restricted area. You can look at the facility from the outside, maybe using your support to scan for more information, then plan your way in. Do you go in guns blazing or sneak in, grab the loot and sneak out? It's entirely up to you and either way can be extremely satisfying. In many places they may look intimidating and dangerous at first, but should you study them enough, you can usually find a very easy way to get in and out. I love that.\n\nI won't lie, it took me a bit to get used to it and get into it but now I'm hooked. At the time of writing this I'm about 27 hours into the game and it looks like there is still plenty to do.\n\nProblems: The AI pathing is atrocious. The amount of times I've lost agents or ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off enemy corps because the ai decided to take a short cut through barriers of poison gas or to glitch themselves into a restricted area...\n\nAnother small problem is that, now I've had so much time in the game, I can really exploit the mechanics of the game. I know how it will react when I do something and it's just starting to feel very easy now. Maybe that's down to the power of my fully augmented and equipped agents somewhat too. It's still a lot of fun though.\n\nThis game is great, despite some really dodgy AI and pathing. I would have liked to have more customising on the agents, but you can't have it all. Not only is this game good, it's also precious. There are far too few books/movies/games with cyberpunk themes nowadays, and this game does a great job of keeping that amazing genre alive.","September 15, 2015","true","37.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm a big fan of other RTS-games, especially XCOM-EW. This is a game among few for me that makes time fly, seriously addicting! It's a little bit hard to get a hold of all technical stuff and the terminology, but when you get into it, the game is AWESOME! I reckon the replayability is quite high since you get a hang of it pretty much after about 50% of the game. It becomes somewhat easy when you level up your characters (most recent missions I've been able to use stealth with the soldier and infiltrator and clear one mission every 10 minutes). I've been playing this in version 0.93 so there are some bugs, but not many at all (even though NPC:s getting stuck after about 30 minutes into a mission makes you tear your hair..).\n\nI give this game 8,5/10","August 26, 2015","true","32.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

A few months later, I have mixed feelings.  Satellite Reign certainly evokes Syndicate, and moreso Syndicate Wars, but lacks the finesse that made those games such classics.  Point by point, everything's there: the Blade-Runner visuals, the cybernetic implants, the mind control devices, but they all feel stale and lifeless.\nA lot of this has to do with the change in pace.  While Bullfrog's classics had barely any animation for most actions, your agents take ages to do pretty much anythingin Satellite Reign, with detailed but unnecessary animations for getting into cover, pulling up a gun to sight, etc.  The consequence is that what was originally a fast-paced, tightly controlled game now handles like molasses.  It takes upwards of a second for your agents to actually act on your orders, and the fiddly nature of the contextual controls means that when they finally do, you might be surprised by what they actually start doing.  All the punch and feel of the original is missing, and this shatters any sense of nostalgia for me.  Contrast games like Sublevel Zero, which capture the movement and experience of their inspirations, and it's hard not to feel disappointed.  In fact, if they fixed the controls and combat pacing, that would be enough for me to recommend this game, despite its other flaws.\nThere's a similar problem in the tone and setting; while the visuals are very pretty, they don't quite convey the sense of oppression in the originals, and the world doesn't have the sense of mystery and misinformation that Syndicate Wars did.  The story places you as an almost-valiant underdog, and without the clearly amoral tone of Syndicate, where you are exactly like your opponents from the very beginning, the narrative elements are just bland.  The story and tone, like the gameplay, capture the surface elements of Syndicate Wars perfectly, but miss the details of execution and performance, and consequently the impact.\nIronically, this game shines brightest in the ways it's not like Syndicate.  The class based stealth and problem solving has echoes of Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines.  Whilst not as well developed as that game's strategic challenges, it is engaging and balances freedom with puzzle design well.  Whilst not as evocative as Syndicate Wars, the bright neon colours of Satellite Reign are more beautiful than anything I ever saw in that game, and not just because of modern hardware.  There's the beginnings of a game that can stand on its own two feet here - but I don't feel it's there just yet.  Perhaps 5 Lives need to find the courage to take their ideas from out of the shadow of Syndicate Wars, and let someone else do justice to a remake.","December 1, 2015","false","18.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Too confusing and aggravating to be fun.\nGOOD: Music, city atmosphere.\n\nLong:\n\nI know I only played a few hours, and I will adjust my review as my gametime increases, but I feel the need to write a review right away, because there are several things that greatly affect my expectations and enjoyment of the game right from the start.\n\nThere are several things wrong right away, and potentially ruin the game completely.\n\nFirst, the tutorial is way too short. Only a few things are explained, and there is no way to go back in the tutorial, nor is there a way to save during the tutorial. And there is no manual!\n\nSo very early on in the game, you run into stuff that is not explained, like for instance the "hijacking" skill.\n\nNow, there are a lot of "tutorial" moments that try to explain stuff. You are constantly bombarded with messages that you have to read, which interrupt the game. Some of those even at crucial moments! While you are waiting for timers on camera's for instance, the game annoyingly wants your attention, Hey, Look at me! Forget the game, let the guards catch you! Really annoying. (Especially the "Fast Travel" moment is very bad. The message stays in your screen, overrides everything, and makes your travel to a point you don't want to go, without the option to travel back. Major design flaw here!)\n\nAnother thing that is very confusing, is the city itself. It is beautifully made, but every inch looks exactly the same. There are no visual indicators to easily see in which area you are, or where you are relative to certain objects. It is so easy to completely forget where you are, and there is no full overview map, only a minimap. Where the hell am I? is something you will ask yourself, trust me.\n\nThere is no mission order. The game starts with 2 missions. Seems easy enough. However, as soon as you start doing those, and explore the city more, you start getting more and more missions. You are swamped with missions, objectives and stories. So much so, that it is becoming confusing and annoying. You have no clue what to do next. Every time you turn a new corner, some annoying message alerts you to a new mission, and more lore, while you are just trying to focus on your current mission. Sure, it is nice that there are a lot of missions to do, but the game overloads you with info and missions so much, that you lose track and get annoyed, and want to skip reading all the lore all together, which can't be good.\n\nThe saving system is terrible, and believe me, this game needs saving a lot. If you don't save right from the start, you will quickly stop liking this game.\n\nThe game gives you the idea you can save anywhere, outside of restricted areas and combat, and return where you left off. Sadly, when you reload, you start at the last/closest beacon from where you were, which is really annoying. And since you cannot save in a restricted area, you basically cannot save during any mission. It means that every time you come back to the game, and want to continue, you have to remember what you were doing, and walk back to the point you were, and start your infiltration all over again.  Why??? If you can save at a certain point on the map, why not on any point? This mechanic is stupid, aggravating and unnecessarily penalizing. It ruins your fun.\n\nIf there is one thing that is unforgivable in a game, and very bad design, and poor judgement, is penalizing a player when he is not doing well in the game. Sure, a game can be hard and challenging, but punishing a player for not performing well is a flawed and very bad idea. One of the core purposes of a game is to entertain, to give you joy, even when it is challenging. It should make you want to come back and try again. Making people suffer with bad saving and walking back half the city, not knowing where the hell they were when they screwed up, is not much fun.\n\nThe few good things of the game are the music and the atmosphere of the city, but for me it is clear that the designers have very little experience playing with other games, and are terrible at the construction of a game, don't know what entertainment really means, and lack empathy for the average new player. The fact that you can code, does not mean you are a good Game Maker, and this game is an example of that, for me at least.\n\nEdit: I know I only played a few hours, but the fact the game already annoys me, and makes me want to stop playing, is not a good sign! I don't feel the sense of excitement, or need for discovery, that other games give me. That, in itself, counts heavily.","December 26, 2015","false","2.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","1"

I've lost at least an hour to autosaves that didn't actually save, being forced to reload half way through a successful stealth through a compound because a drone glitched out on a set of stairs that happened to be the only way to continue through the level, AI that can 'wall-hack' and spot you half way across the map behind cover for no apparent reason, etc, etc. For every two steps forward I made, the game forced me to take one step back because of the lack of polish. I could forgive it if it was me making the mistakes but in almost every case it wasn't.\n\nCombat is boring and ridiculously simplistic. Don't expect the AI to do anything more than stand in the open and spray bullets at you until people start dying. There's no skill, tactics, or strategy required here and it's pretty disappointing.\n\nSome mechanics simply don't make sense at all. You need a skill to use a zipline? Seriously? I've got a belt and two hands that will let me use any zipline I ever wanna use. Who thought this was a clever idea?\n\nThe tutorial in some parts just flat out forget to mention some game mechanics - to warn others, when the game teaches you how to hijack people, your target's under a camera. Thanks for letting us know that cameras can somehow see a person getting hijacked! Then shoving the console for turning them off half way across the map. Wait, the guy that needs to hack the console is also the guy that needs to hijack the person? Aye yai yai.\n\nThis game has potential but it needs quite a bit more work. Based off the experience I've had with it so far, I simply can't recommend it to others at this time.\n\nEdit: So after several patches, I decided to come back to this game and see if it's any better. I've made it to the final area of the game and completed most of the missions in the game in all the prior districts. So reading this, you must think, it's a lot better now, right? No. I'm not going to bother finishing this game. My characters are more powerful, they have great gear and I'm quite used to the game play and all the glitches that can and will happen throughout a mission but that doesn't mean this has been much of a fun experience. It's the little glitches and jank that add up.\n\nFor example, I missed out on the entering CBD peacefully achievement after going through the giant mess to get the cards you need to enter because when my guys went into the second scanning room, the entering door closed first instead of the exit door and blocked three of my four guys from going inside the room. So what did the AI do? It decided to go around the door and right into the restricted zone where everything turns hostile the moment you go into it. I had no control over this, it happened within a second. Great. Thanks, a little bug/oversight and all that hard work gone to ♥♥♥♥. I suppose I could have reloaded a save but you know what? I'm tired of doing that. I had to do that constantly just to play this game to deal with all its little problems and issues and it was the final straw. I could give example after example after example of all the little problems like that but it doesn't matter.\n\nThe devil is in the details and it's a measure of the quality of the game. This game is rife with small issues galore and it's massively disappointing. So 20 hours in and a few hours away from finishing the game, I give up and wave the white flag. And to think that instead of fixing up their game they're adding co-op to it to further compound the amount of stuff that could go wrong.

It can get infuriating when your team gets stuck on geometry when you only have a one second window to move them into cover. An enemy team can also get stuck near an entrance you need to access. A shame really.\n\nThe other big problem is that it gets repetitive after a while. There are 4 sectors to unlock and by the time I was nearing the end of the 2nd one I was more or less done with the gameplay. You break into the base, you sneak around and you get out.

No, no I don't.\n\nThe game right now is a pre-alpha, which means it's basically a demo. Is a demo worth 30$? No it's not.\n\nI bought this game because I've been following it for a bit (I'm not a backer on KickStarter, it's not really my thing).\n\nI'm a huge fan of the original Syndicate (I still play it today). What this game has right now is the ambience. You play it, and it feels like Syndicate, with better graphics, and less features ('cause it's a pre-alpha).\n\nI bought this game full-well knowing this. And I still put out $30 of my money for it. Why? Because it wants to be the next Syndicate, and it's on a very good path to being just that. And they have at least one developer on the team that worked on the original. The groundwork has been put out, and if you had the chance to play it, you will know that the spirit of Syndicate carries on this in game.\n\nIn this state, no, it's not worth it for the average joe.

Needs polish. lots of it.\n\n\n\nA wide range of technical problems aside (MOST NOTEWORTHY BEING THE LONG-♥♥♥ LOAD TIME AT THE START OF THE GAME) ...\n\n+Stealth and anonymity system is rock-solid. Not once have i questioned why or how i got caught. (also, Infiltrator is waaaay overpowered if used in the right circimstances.)\n\n-Long distance pathfinding is a bit of a problem. sometimes agents choose to run straight through restricted sectors and end up being swiss cheese or paying fines out the ♥♥♥. or both.\n\n-UI, its a little clunky and confusing at first.\n\n-The cloning system: Quite frankly its confusing as ♥♥♥♥ when you are first introduced to it, but i guess this could simply be attributed to the poor UI.\n\n-In a game based on timing and sync between agents, The game REALLY needs a pause button. seriously.\n\n-Cannot customize squad very well: you can't change classes, and you can change *very* little beyond the glowing neon lights everyone shares and individual colors of cloth.\n\n-Maybe its just the way I play, but the soldier class is, in my opinion, particularly useless in anything beyond hardwiring (a skill that should honestly and probably belong to the tech) and providing a distraction, which *might* work in some cases.\n\n-Energy and money. Both of these are highly restrictive when you first start (hell, energy is STILL restrictive.) sometimes theres literally nothing to do but twiddle your thumbs and hope noone finds you while your energy regens at a snails pace.","March 25","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was so wrong!\nThis game was supposed to be a remake of the old and glorious Syndicate, but the developers didn't just copy from that title. They created a squad-based cyberpunk game that offers incredible freedom. Not only because you can choose the order in which to complete the missions, but also because there are really many, many ways to customize your squad to suit your gameplay.\nYou abduct people to provide bodies for your agents; homless and hobos won't be missed by the indifferent city but offer little in the way of bonuses. Policemen, soldiers and officers have higher requirements but offer more varied bonuses. You may focus on speed, energy, health regeneration and so on; different bonuses may also be indicated for different characters: you command four cyborgs belonging to four different classes. The stelth-based infiltrator will probably benefit mostly from energy, which allows himto remain invisibile. The soldier may be better off with enhanced health and so on.\nIn addition to selecting a base body, you can also augment your agents in different ways. Different parts for head, torso, legs and arms offer different bonuses. Of course, you can also select the loadout of your agents. Weapons, which have their own range of enhancements, and generic gear like grenades, medipaks, ammo, remote hacking devices, stealth field generators, energy optimizers.\nToo bad that just when you unlock all the interesting stuff, the game is about to end. I loved the final mission and the ending, it was all appropriately epic, without resorting to the tired mega-boss schema. Should they make a second chapter, or maybe even a DLC pack, I will probably purchase it.\nI did lose my temper a few times, when the endless respawning enemies repeatedly cost me half hours of gameplay. Turns out I wasn't careful with "heat" levels, so heavy enemies were unleashed in droves at me. Being careful, even when choosing the guns blazing approach, pays off and makes the game even more enjoyable. This, and the "Team Stims" skill of the support agent, I realized too late how invaluable it was.\nAll in all, a very good game, a rare gem for a little known team of developers.","February 7","true","47.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's far from perfect, it has it's nuances and the occasional bug, but its solid and addictive gameplay trigger that 'I'm having fun' vibe that many games can just miss despite all of the trimmings on offer.\n\nIf you were a fan of the old Sydicate games then this is about as close as you can get within a modern game to the glorious nostalgic feelings of your younger days that you've been clinging onto. For anyone just trying this game out without any pre concieved ideas then it's going to be a challenging and addictive game from beggining to end.\n\nIt does get a little grindy towards the end, and the story is a little weak in places, however there is just enough to keep you coming back for more, watching your technology ramp up and develop new and interesting technology to deal with your enemies.\n\nIf you're into tactical squad based combat, stealth, a little micro management... and of course massive devastating weapons and cool gadgets then this is your game.\n\nI think everyone should give this one a go.","March 16","true","50.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The cyberpunk setting and art are beautifully presented and the squad based action gameplay is solid. Running amok in a dystopian future run by greedy megacorporations, dishing out countless violent deaths with an arsenal of weapons at the hands of my cybernetically altered agents, while carving out my own place in this world..what more could you want from a game. I would have preferred a classless game with agents totally customizable (including an option to wear the classic trenchcoats from Syndicate) instead of the specific agent designs. Another thing I noticed was I quickly acquired plasma weapons, before even getting the prototypes for the ballistic weapons and other gear, which made alot of it seem pointless. Seeing references to Bullfrog in the game was also pretty cool and gave me nostalgic memories from the golden age of PC gaming. A fair priced game worth checking out if you have played the older games, or even if you're a fan of squad based strategy games.

But with time this game looks like it will be one amazing cyberpunk game. On a gameplay note I love how they are implementing a stealth system into a RTS style game. Currently they have a few missions and a weak AI.but as said this is still in Pre-Alpha so they are just giving us a little taste of whats to come, and I cant wait. An example story of a fun little expensure I had is below:\n\n"Early On you have to sneak past some guards in order to open a gate, and get to downtown. In order to do so I ran my hacker to hack the security cam and turn it off, after that I got my soldier to run into cover while a guard was looking. The guard slowly started to move over to investigate finding my soldier "hiding" immediately he started walking him away hands above his head. This allowed me to run my other man to the door and my hacker to open the door. Once the door was opened I ran my soldier away from the guard and over to the opened door... Sadly, the guard didnt put up any fight, he didnt try to shoot me or even chase me that fast. Let alone open the closed door with a keycard or passcode. But then again, this game is still in Pre-Alpha so the AI is obviously going to be a bit weak as said.","March 18, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I've played it for a couple of hours now, but found it got tedious very quickly - I wouldn't recommend buying at this stage *IF* you're hoping for something you can already get your teeth into.\n\nYou start straight into the tutorial which teaches you the very basics, and are then left standing in the city with little idea of what to do next.\n\nThere are a few missions accessible through what I'd call the map screen which seems to be playing the role of the in game menu, with tabs for research, missions, system, etc. - It's pretty naff but it allows you to do what you need to do which I'm sure serves the purpose of the early access release. I'm sure the UI will be developed further.\n\nThere's no sense of purpose yet which is the only reason I got bored so quickly, and I'll probably refrain from playing any further until the game is either much further along in development or actually released.\n\nReally excited about playing it again when it's finished, or at least once the aforementioned lack of any sense of why you're there, why you've got beef with the other groups, why should you infiltrate that facility etc. has been rectified - as someone else said in a review, story is important! Openworld / non-linear can be great, but you still need a sense of purpose or you're just working through a mundane list in a menu.\n\nSome kind of background story should also give you some context as to what is right and wrong in this world - Does murdering innocents carry any real consequence other than a few police showing up? Does killing the police mean anything more than a flashing exclamation mark in a box and perhaps a couple more police showing up? You get the point.\n\nOverall, would I recommend buying it? When it's finished, if it becomes what it's shaping up to be: YES!\nIs it fun to play right now at this stage? Not really - I would only recommend buying right now if you want to support the devs like I do, or actually get involved in the development process (which of course is the purpose of Early Access).\n\n\n","April 24, 2015","true","27.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gameplay has improved, loads of content has been added, the game has been substantially optimized and loads of bugs have been fixed.\n\nSo what is it? Short answer: it's a reboot of the original 1994 Syndicate. For those of you that haven't played the original Syndicate: It's a cyberpunk themed game where you command a specialized team of agents. I guess you could call it a RTS with action and stealth elements. As you play your agents gain skills, you research new weapons and technology and can outfit your agents with augments.\n\nThe developers have created a very believable dystopian future city that you can explore, do missions in, sneak around in, fight in, and in some cases manipulate systems in to give you an edge over rival corporations and security forces.\n\nYou have to play this game for at least a few hours to appreciate why it is so good. It reminds me of Deus Ex in that the more you upgrade and outfit your agents the more possibilities you have in terms of infiltrating compounds. It's up to you whether you'd like to go in guns blazing or if you'd rather take a carefully planned approach.\n\nFor example, you can hack an enemy drone and let it fly past all security to check the place out before you go in. Then you can have the drone attack key security cameras that you'll need to get past. The enemy will destroy the rogue drone, but they'll have no idea you were controlling it. Then you send in your infiltrator, using stealth to avoid being seen, climbing through vents, and picking off lone guards with melee attacks and a silenced sniper rifle. The tactics in the game are really deep and really well thought out.\n\nThe only criticism I have is that I'd like the clone, augmentation and inventory management interfaces to be revamped to feel more tactile and impactful. Augmentations were a big part of the original Syndicate and it feels a bit hollow in this game.\n\nOverall though, great game!","January 19, 2015","true","29.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomansland/recommended/268870/","nomansland","Chronic Logic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomansland/","341 products in account","It's a good game overall except for a few cringing details.\n\nIf you are looking for an immersive cyberpunk RPG, look somewhere else. This is pretty much an action(and/or)stealth game. Your main task is simply to gear up. Literally every time you come into a new zone a voice tells you "ok we got no leads, so gear up in the meantime". Your characters don't have names but functions: "Soldier", "Hacker", "Support", and "Infiltrator". You can clone NPC's and assign them as a characters avatar, making it hard to feel anything towards someone stripped of all individuality. I ended up giving remote hack to my Infiltrator and did most of the zones just using him. There are 4 zones in total and they all have the same opposing faction buildings so the content gets old fast.\n\nHowever the layout is pretty and different and that's where the game shines. Honestly, I didn't like the game at first, but a few hours in (once i got familiar with controls and options) I found myself scheming, silently assasinating patrols and anticipating AI movements (AI is poor at times, but can also be challenging) with a giddy smile. If things get hairy and you brought in the whole team, you can outmaneuver and/or overpower the enemy. Otherwise watch your agent dash desperately towards a vent or a door and hope they get there before the bullets get to you. Good music; travel is usually not a hastle, most of the terrain is destructible.\n\nOverall the gameplay is pretty fun once you get into it. The game is worth the discount, but i would advise against the full price.","December 28, 2015","true","133.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Another great genre has been resurrected.\nSatellite Reign is the crowd funded spiritual successor to 1993's Syndicate by Bullfrog and Ocean Software. That's quite the pairing of companies, which makes me sad that I never played Syndicate, because from my research, I'm sure I would have loved it. I have however played other games in the genre, so I am at least familiar enough with Satellite Reign's roots. SR is a tactical RTS set in a dystopian future à la Perfect Dark, where city services are privately owned and PMC soldiers roam the streets with assault rifles and drones. You control a specialised 4 man squad of terrorists as they roam the city, destabilise the PMCs, rob banks and kidnap hobos.\n\nThe game drops you into a tutorial sequence that teaches you the basics. Just the basics. A lot of what happens in this game, you're going to have to work out from experience, because the only place you're going to get information after the tutorial is in the quest log. It's not too bad as long as you have a modicum of common sense, but it would be nice to see some of the features expanded on. The cloning aspect of the game for example is only mentioned in vague terms. When a soldier dies, their consciousness is transferred to a clone which degrades each time the process occurs. You can hijack anyone's neural implants to control them and send them back to base to add to your pool of clones. What I would have liked to have seen is some mechanic where you can combine the genes of 2 clones to create a new source clone. As it is, cloning is just an inconvenience meant to give you some way to maintain your soldiers. The hijacking mechanic has other interesting uses though. I had to infiltrate a shipping yard, so I scoured the backstreets for as many hobos as I could control and sent them on a suicide assault at the front of the base while my squad slipped by unnoticed. Moments like that are memorable, and it's great to see a game that gives you the freedom to think outside the box.\n\nAlso featured is a prototype research system. When you successfully complete a mission, you will probably steal a prototype. This can be a weapon, gear or implant. Your soldiers can equip the loot, but if you research it, you will be able to mass produce the item. I like this system. It reminds me of XCOM's method of loot progression. Like XCOM, you recruit scientists to research your prototypes. The early researches take about 15 minutes of real time to complete and will constantly drain your funds while it happens. Partnered with this mechanic is the ATM siphon mechanic. You can rob a bank for a one time large sum of money, but the bulk of your income will come from the ATMs around the world that you physically go to and install a siphon virus onto. Most will give you around 20c per second, a rate that can be improved by infiltrating a bank with your hacker. This small trickle of funds means that your researches have to be prioritised. Thats a nice, organic way to involve the player in what I call "budgetting strategy". Both systems work well together and provide the backbone for the progression throughout the game.\n\nThe game looks great, despite its modest download size. The aesthetic is the same classic cyberpunk that we've come to expect since Blade Runner. Lots of neon decorate the streets and the people who populate the world have crazy hair, tatoos and sci fi sunglasses. It's pretty great. What isn't great however is the performance of the game. I have a decent system which sufficed to say should have no issue with this game, but unfortunately I couldn't seem to get more than about 40fps on a regular basis. I was having a blast with the game, but it's a shame that I didn't have the most responsive experience given that the game is largely about precision in execution. Of course, with many technical issues, your mileage may vary, so just be aware that you may also encounter less than optimal performance.The soundtrack in my opinion is serviceable, providing the appropriate cyberpunk techno that you would expect with just a dash of 80's sci fi thrown in for a bit of character. There aren't really any memorable tunes here, but the soundtrack may serve as ambient sci fi music if you have use for that sort of thing elsewhere. I found it decent enough to add to my board game playlist. The soundtrack is available in both mp3 and flac formats.\n\nI really liked this game. It's great to see genres returning via crowdfunding that wouldn't otherwise be produced. Satellite Reign is a competent tactical RTS that held my attention for hours and probably one that I will want to replay at some point. It's a nice mix of genres that satisfies several itches, whether you want stealth, tactical firefights or hobo assaults. Highly recommended to fans of the genre who want something new.","December 28, 2015","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The tag strategy is a bit misleading, since it has as much "strategy" as Far Cry 3 does. This doesn't mean that planning an attack is unnecessary, since the player can easily get outnumbered and gunned down if they are not careful.\n\nThe music and aesthetic are amazing. The sound design is spot on, and generally the game is truly immersive. Not in the sense of story or plot, since most of the backstory for the missions are text based, and most of the plot takes a backseat to the action.\n\nAs stated before, the gameplay is great. The fire fights can get pretty intense, and the stealth mechanics (using cover, cloaking, hacking, and hardwiring) are awesome as well. Cover provides defensive bonuses, and most cover is destructable, making late game fire fights even more hectic. As it says in the trailer, it is open world, meaning you can approach a compound however you want. There are some balance issues, such as minor weapon imbalances, being able to replace single use items (grenades, etc) with an infinite- use ammo box, and the proxy hacker.\n\nNow for the bad parts. I saved this section for later in the review, since it shouldn't disincentivise someone from getting the game. NPCs and player controlled characters sometimes get stuck on the map geometry, the cover system can be difficult to work with, and teammates may randomly become slower or faster, regardless of equipment.\n\nI'm not good at writing conclusions, but if I were to recommend this game, I would recomend it to someone who wants to get into real time strategy, but normally finds them boring. It is an intense yet easy game to get behind, and definitely worth playing. To be honest, this game isn't worth 32.99- I would say it is more worth 20 bucks, but that is just me. Definitely buy it when it goes on sale.\n\nIf I were to give it a rating out of 100, I would say it gets a solid 78 out of 100.","January 25","true","43.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was so wrong!\nThis game was supposed to be a remake of the old and glorious Syndicate, but the developers didn't just copy from that title. They created a squad-based cyberpunk game that offers incredible freedom. Not only because you can choose the order in which to complete the missions, but also because there are really many, many ways to customize your squad to suit your gameplay.\nYou abduct people to provide bodies for your agents; homless and hobos won't be missed by the indifferent city but offer little in the way of bonuses. Policemen, soldiers and officers have higher requirements but offer more varied bonuses. You may focus on speed, energy, health regeneration and so on; different bonuses may also be indicated for different characters: you command four cyborgs belonging to four different classes. The stelth-based infiltrator will probably benefit mostly from energy, which allows himto remain invisibile. The soldier may be better off with enhanced health and so on.\nIn addition to selecting a base body, you can also augment your agents in different ways. Different parts for head, torso, legs and arms offer different bonuses. Of course, you can also select the loadout of your agents. Weapons, which have their own range of enhancements, and generic gear like grenades, medipaks, ammo, remote hacking devices, stealth field generators, energy optimizers.\nToo bad that just when you unlock all the interesting stuff, the game is about to end. I loved the final mission and the ending, it was all appropriately epic, without resorting to the tired mega-boss schema. Should they make a second chapter, or maybe even a DLC pack, I will probably purchase it.\nI did lose my temper a few times, when the endless respawning enemies repeatedly cost me half hours of gameplay. Turns out I wasn't careful with "heat" levels, so heavy enemies were unleashed in droves at me. Being careful, even when choosing the guns blazing approach, pays off and makes the game even more enjoyable. This, and the "Team Stims" skill of the support agent, I realized too late how invaluable it was.\nAll in all, a very good game, a rare gem for a little known team of developers.","February 7","true","47.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game reminded me a lot of Baldur's Gate, but with a Deus Ex theme.  My only gripe was the level of difficulty near the end was pretty lame.  Once you get the best sheilds, armor, weapons and cybernetics, you hardly need to hide anymore, you can just walk into any building and clear it out and take whatever you want.  At the begining of the game, its really hard tho, you have to sneak around or you will die.  I prefered this better.  I think this game has a very steep learning curve, because you have to control a team of 4 people, each with different skills and styles of play.","April 4","true","42.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I got dubious at first, but after some time I decided to give it a shot.\n\nEssentially it could be summed as this : Came for Syndicate, stayed for Satellite Reign. I got Really hooked on all the tactical aspects, the cross references and all you the stuff you need to check ahead and plan before actually doing it. For that matter, I might be the type to have been using the Support's world scan ability the most, and that gave me a pretty good idea of the degree of complexity involved in the level design. There are 4 zones. Might seem short, and that's because it is. If I could have another 2 zones, I'd take em without hesitation.\n\nThe fact is, the concept works. You have a small team of experts with the potential of being ludicrously powerful near the end, but like all Elites, you'll die in a swarm if you take the wrong approach. Meanwhile, if you're particularly patient, you can go through without spotted at any point in time, and have that sweet sensation of being a really sneaky and cunning little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (which you can most likely guess, I was in my playthroughs). Another great thing I enjoyed was how you can trick civilians into tripping guard patrols, wasting their times, getting them blamed for a body they happened to walk near-by and other sort of thing that make you grin because you're allowed to shift all the blame of your nasty stuff onto some completely innocent bystander that'll end up fined or shot for the transgression.\n\nWhat do I reckon could use some polishing : Well pathfinding occasionally messes up. It doesn't happen often, but still regularly enough to be noticeable. Guards tend to try to go from a door to another, and simply fail to exit. Luckily, your agents have a wide array of skill to just mess with them and get them killed.\nInventory tend to be too limited, even with the Pack Mule skills available to all. But in a way it serves as much as a balancing feature as much of reinforcing the idea that you're only specializing a team of specialists further. Still, I would have liked at least more freedom in the way of weapon carrying capacity. In a similar vein, Hijacking units is very fun and actually very useful, but would be much deeper if there was a way for players to instruct the hijacked to pick up weapons, or allow them to get kitted out via the relay beacons, even if that weapons the weapon is lost when the hibjacked is freed or dead. Again is the same vein : I found that enemies not using sniper rifles was actually kind of a swing and miss : the sniper rifle handling would work Very well with a computer, since aiming is both visible to the player, and gives enough time for them to either duck for cover or run and gun the sniper. Still the possibility of having a sniper nest as an obstacles would make for a nice amount of challenge and a change of pace.\n\nAs mentionned above, I found 4 zones to be too short, even if all 4 zones were handcrafted and the systems associated with each spots were very well made indeed. The fact of the matter is, this layout wont change, which mean you atleast need a certain number to limit repetition. As an alternative, releasing a map editor and letting players create their zones might yield interesting results (even if I have no doubt it'll take a year or so for someone to make as detailed a map as the ones ingame. Ultimately, I hope the team pursues development, having additional zones available (through DLC or expansion, or via a map editor).\n\nIt's not Syndicate (Syndicate was a lot more straightforward and simple), rather it's closer to Commando, but it's pretty much the same lore and the same gameplay architecture, with a more complex and tactical system.\n\nDo I recommend it ? Hell yeah ! The game stands on it's own, and it's a genre you simply Dont see done so often anymore.","June 3","true","37.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That basically means it's Syndicate with more colors and a little bit of Shadowrun. The city is not that open and the game does not require that much strategy, but it's a nice, less grim and more colorful, Syndicate lookalike.\n\nYou control 4 agents - soldier, support, hacker, infiltrator - through four districts of a cyberpunk city. The agents can be enhanced via leveling their skills, augmenting them with new cybernetics or equipping them with new gear and weapons. Plenty to all that to choose from. The main story is rather short, but there are many side missions along the way to keep you busy. Each mission allows for killing or stealthing your way through and there are always several ways you can handle given mission, which is nice. The visuals were a little bright to my taste at first, but after getting used to them I think it's actually quite a nice cyberpunk setting. It took me less than 30hrs to finish and apart from nonexistant visual character customization I enjoyed Satellite Reign immensely.\n\nI liked:\n* cyberpunk!\n* possibility to stealth your way through everything\n* visuals\n* plenty of side missions\n* music\n\nI disliked:\n* controls can be inconvenient\n* last mission is a bit meh\n\nGet this if:\n* you would like to play a more colorful Syndicate\n* you like cyberpunk\n\nDon't get this if:\n* you're looking for open world gameplay\n* you expect deep story\n","June 3","true","31.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very cool cyberpunk atmosphere, an open world, good selection of abilities and equipment, and lots of other things that all add up to one excellent game.\n\nI particularly like how every mission can be approached in multiple ways. For example say you have a mission to go steal a prototype piece of equipment, well you can just run in guns blazing and hope you can fight your way through waves of guards and steal it. If that isn't your style you could pay an informant that might lead you to an employee who will, with the right incentive, unlock a back way for you to fight through more easily. Heck, maybe you like stealth and would prefer not to fight anyone, well you can do that too.\n\nI do however have a couple things that I am not the hugest fan of but in reality are relatively minor. My biggest gripe is that the game does not make it very clear as to how far or what the guards can see, and sometimes that can make stealth a bit of a pain. Also I find that often when entering and exiting stealth your selected unit will get confused if you try to give it a command immediately afterwards, which when you are short on time can lead to being spotted out by a guard.\n\nAll in all though, Satellite Reign is a unique experience and worth checking out. If you are on the fence and looking through reviews to see if you should buy this game, all I can say is that I have been having a blast so far and that it was money well spent.\n\nI give it a 9/10.","September 3, 2015","true","10.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's rather short and there isn't a lot of replayability in it.  Unless you're really into these kinds of games or you're a fan of the original Syndicate, I'd wait for a Sale.\n\nAs a fan of the original Syndicate, Satellite Reign really does feel like a true spiritual sucessor.  But like other spiritual sucessor games made years later through crowdfunding (I'm looking at you in particular Wasteland 2) too much nostalgia has crept into the more recent game, and not always for the better.\n\nSome thoughts:\n\nAside from the first area and the final encounter there was rarely any need to use tactics, especially once you're well armed and have a highjacked unit or two in tow.  I did just as well mid-game with all my units running and gunning together than I did trying to be creative.\n\nAI can be a little wonky at times.  Nothing too major, but you have to babysit units since they won't always return fire or find cover and sometimes they'll try to fire through objects in the environment rather than go around for a proper shot.  Some pathfinding issues too, but again, it's fairly minor.\n\nHaving four units with different capabilities was a nice touch, but more often than not it just meant the other three stood around while one guy used his unique abilities.  I found more utility in using their skills on the interactive bits in the environment; hacking doors, cameras and guards or shutting down generators to avoid combat.\n\nThe interface is clean and intuitive.  The skill buttons were on the small side but I didn't end up using many of them aside from Scan, Hijack and Grenades.\n\nSome players have an issue with the lack of an auto-pause, but I never found it to be a major issue.  There is a "Bullet Time" type skill that's a close enough analog.\n\nThe research and trickle-in income system (through hacking ATM's) is a mixed bag.  This is one of those nostalgic bits that feels like it needed work.  At least 6-8 hours of my 27 hour playtime occured while I was tabbed out, waiting for research projects to finish or money to accumulate to buy new upgrades.\n\nThe visuals and atmosphere in game was excellent.  They nailed the cyberpunk aesthetic.\n\nAlthough the story was forgettable the flavour text in logs, notes and descriptions had some nice touches.\n\n\nAll in all, it's a solid little game thats worth a playthrough.","September 5, 2015","true","28.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's graphically gorgeous, the tone is savvy, the missions make you think, firefights make you break a sweat every time.\n\nThen there's a few hickups, or heart attacks, depending on the player.\n\nFirst issue I had was the lack of tactical pause in the game.  I can buy into the 'this is a RTS, no pause and giving orders' but I've played a number of games that featured that construction (Pillars of Eternity, Starcraft, Age of Empires 2, a few others).  They have this bullet-time thing to replace it, but it costs energy and it covers the screen in this effect that makes me dizzy. If you're not going to impliment tactical pausing, then there should be number 2.\n\nAuto-Attack.  I don't know how many times I lost my... we'll call them minions, because they were detected and rather than go hot, they just sucked up the damage.  It gets worse when you have three squads (one of your minions can 'hijack' NPC's and make them allies) and I'm making a firefight while one of my minions sneaks into the fortress and does her mission.  Well... in the course of that time, Squad 1 kills its target and goes to cover, squad 2 goes to cover, I select another target and another, I'm flipping between three squads trying to keep them alive.  It's not fun, it's stressful.  If that's your thing, all power to you.\n\nAnother issue is that the game still feels like a beta (probably because it just left it).  I haven't seen an issue with graphics (through there is this haze that makes me want to clean my monitor sometimes) and I've only had two instances in 10 hours where my minions got stuck; but pathfinding is sketchy, the auto-attack is missing, places where your minions should take cover aren't available to be used as cover, the sniper (while powerful) is missing a stealth kill function (they have a one-shot kill system if you've not been detected, but your sniper takes about 2 seconds to fire which is 2 seconds your character will be seen and shot at, if it takes that long to make a kill like that, make the time frame longer and with the sniper's range, or half the range, not point blank).\n\nCombat feels like a punishment than a method.  Unless you're a excellent micromanager who can manage up to eight characters at the same time.  The auto-attack would make it feel more viable, instead I usually reload or retreat when combat hits because (at the start) your characters are underpowered compared to the opposition which forces you into the stealth system (fortunately, the devs implemented a mission system to relieve the strain after a little work).\n\nOn the up side:  The Devs are very active and the community isn't toxic.  I've posted a few times and the community was quick on the uptake.  The Devs are explaining their thought process and are open to suggestion,  and I'm hoping that my issues are resolved in the next patch (I mean, if you add auto-attack, this game would rock and roll with a bass drop).\n\nHopefully this game is like a wine that get's better with age (and I'm excited for them to open a workshop/mod system because this game would rock more when the modding community get's its hands on it).  It has so much potential and (for the most part) it's living to that potential.  But it needs a few layers of polish still.\n\nIf you decide to purchase this game, you'll get a strtegy game that forces you to plan your movement and the decision to attack is a heavy pro/con system, but you'll get some of the lack-features that really can be irksome (check in a few weeks and hopefully all those issues will be patched!)","August 30, 2015","true","13.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I gave it 3 months (which you've pretty much had to to with all PC games from the beginning of time) and its now improved.  But still kind of broken. I won't go into the great moments and missions I had in the syndicate games, but the greatest thing about those games (which has yet to be replicated) was sending all 4 agents off to do different strategic tasks, like assassinate, blow up bank, stand ground with persuaded citizens and mow down enemies, infiltrate base steal hover car and fly to a point where all agents meet from all corners of the map to extract.\n\nAlthough it might be a performance issue:\n\ni7 Processor\n6GB DDR3 Ram\nx2 HD5870 ATI Video cards\n64 Bit Vista OS\n\nBut until they get it working you'll never get those moments in this game because pathfinding doesn't work.

PLUS THE ONE MAJOR FLAW\n\nProbably a lot of people bought the game because it reminds them on syndicate, and it truly gives off that feeling.\n\nIt's a great game, let's get that out of the way. Sure the pathfinding at first is a pain, but after a few hours you will understand it. The game does lack a story line, but like most cyber punk stories, big biz runs things so you can fill in the gaps.\n\nThe game has an awsome idea, you have four clones who each have a role. A soilder, support, hacker, and infiltrator which I'll get into detail about the roles at the end of this. Your hacker can hijack people who have better stats and send them back to be cloned, so you can switch into their bodies...Or you can form a little army and make them follow you and fight with you.\n\nGame play is what it's all about. This is where it may lose some people. You are tough but the baddies are as well, it's like not like you can have 2 hold a choke point,  while two other clones go ahead because you will get beat down.  There is very little out flanking moments because generally it feels like you all have to aim at the same baddie at once. Plus since it's point and click as well as a far number of keyboard commands which are a mess because the button (G) stands for your bombs, but more than one clone might have bombs.\n\nIt's possible to do flaking when you have a small little army with you, but everyone you hijack is labled as number 5 in response to keyboard button control. You can go into a combat zone and say this is group one and group two because if you hit "1" or "2" it will just select one of your clones.\n\nSo in other words, your fighting in a cluster.\n\nI'm not sure if this is meant to be like this, but I don't think it is due to the roles of your clones. Your support clone even can slow down time to get people to a different location but your energy level goes down really fast. Which is anothe flaw with the game, even running takes away your energy fast, faster than any ability.\n\nIn the end I really enjoyed it stil, I hope there is a DLC.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRoles of your Clones\n\nSolider: No heavy weapon penality-though they don't come in till mid-to late game. He has a few abilities where he can take or give more damage but the energy depeletes so fast you bearly will use it.  He can hardwire generators and turn gas pipes.\n\nSupport. Basically your healer but he can scan for targets and read peoples stats. Other than that he is just sort of there as another gun.\n\nHacker: Probably your most usable character. He can hijack soilders and people to either fight with you or send them back to clone. Of course he can shut down systems and take control over doors. He also has drones. Much of the time he will be running around hijacking people.\n\ninfiltrator: Sort of like your theif/sniper. The clone can clock which doesn't last long, and the sword ability can kill with one thrust, yet again you run into recharge time and energy issues. They can also sneak into places, which you can augment your other players to do so as well.\n\nSince there is a gizmo called a hacker proxy, basically this clone becomes important because the clone doesn't have to equip the stealth generator and your hacker generally has almost no energy because he is controlling hijack soilders. They can sneak in and turn off cameras.\n\nThe sniper riffle is powerful but very slow, you don't have to use it, there are only two sniper rifles in the whole game, but using it does give you some special abilities","September 11, 2015","true","52.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The answer...go somewhere else in the city for a while.   Don't get stuck thinking you need to clear a district to leave a district.

Your team members have 0 personality, you will even have a hard time locating their names. All the customisation process is made through a tedious cloning system, which i didn't really understand, since it's not explained. It's like you can hijack a random citizen and then clone him and use his appearance, like clothes or goggles, which are clonable too i guess.\n\n2. Controls and movement of your squad members are clunky as hell, pathfinding is awful. I bought a sniper rifle with a silencer and ordered my soldier to shoot a lonely cop in the head from a tower, with a clearest line of sight. He ran down from the tower and towards the cop. When i didn't aim for the head he shoot alright, but it was pointless, since it didn't one-shot and cop sounded the alarm.\n\n3. Such things would probably not be a big deal, exept for weird saving system, which throws you to the beginning of the map every load! And i mean the huge district map, not the mission-specified one. You'll have a lot of trouble trying to stealth with no saves and clunky controls.\n\n4. Cardboard city with citizens standing and walking around aimlessly with no signs of ai. Why did they even make it open world if there is nothing in this world?\n\n5. Sound. Your agents are silent, civilians are silent, even ones with talking with each other animation. Music is dull, more of a soundscape.\n\n6.

The depth of approach, multiple methods of completing a "mission" (there are no real missions, just milestones on the road to victory which can be achieved in any order), tactical options and impact of team upgrades is massive. Whilst remaining true to the spiritual predecessors of the Syndicate franchise the leap forwards in game design and evolution of the genre is as much a surprise as the previous 2 games.\nYou have NOT experienced anything this deep, replayable, diverse or rewarding. I have lost count of the number of times I have attempted the initial objectives in the "wrong" order because I didn't really have the right skills and didn't realise it until I got in to the objective zone.

Stealth is emphasized yet extremely difficult due to the clunky AI.

You cannot manage all of your units at once because the game cannot be paused (you get a "stimpacks" ability that slows down time and makes your units faster, but to me this is not a replacement to a pause feature.) While moving units in a group, they are even dumber than usual. One particularly interesting instance had me moving my units across a large portion of map. I clicked once for my team of four.

I can't tell, I never played the original series , so I am in no place to judge. What I can tell you, though, is that the devs failed basic game design.\nSo, quick summary:\nCombat:\nThe game won't ping enemies attacking you, or warn you which of your units is actually under attack\nYour chars are extremely hesitant to return fire, weapons drawn or not. There's no option to change their behaviour, to attack on sight, only return fire or hold fire. You can order them to hide their weapons, but it only affects enemy behaviour.\nCover mechanics are a mess. Sometimes things that should be cover aren't, things that shouldn't are. Sometimes your character detects cover, sometimes they stand on the wrong side of it.\nHalf the time your characters will move around obstacles to try and shoot at enemies, the other half they'll try to shoot through a wall.Thus, combat becomes a mess that relies on your team dogpiling single enemy units.\nStealth:\nYou have no way of actually knowing if your unit is hidden out of view. Ocasionally, team members standings behind high-walls will be detected because they are not using it as cover.\nObjects and walls that should block line of sight don't. Some that should'nt, do.\nAssasination and other stealth skills are broken.  An enemy moving or changing direction seems to cancel assasination.\nThe infiltrator is useless as a stealth character as he doesn't have access to any practical skills like hacking or hardwiring. Even abilities like assasination force him to stand a couple of meters behind an enemy, even though he's holding a sniper rifle.\n\nStealth is a disfunctional bore.\n\nThe two main aspects of this game, combat and stealth, are broken or badly designed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/holdmykidney/recommended/268870/","holdmykidney","holdmykidney","http://steamcommunity.com/id/holdmykidney/","76 products in account","Sadly right now I can't recommend this game. I wanted to love it and I do love huge swathes of it. The city looks amazing, the agent upgrades are genuinely inspiring to get to higher levels and the reimagination of Syndicate - such a huge early part of my gaming life - is excellent.\n\nFor me, it fails as a strategy game.\n\nFirstly, much of the information about how to play the game is unclear. I didn't get anywhere until I checked message boards to find out how this game is supposed to work. For me, having to ask somebody else how to play a game is a clear failure.\n\nMy agents have all levelled up about 10 times. Right now I could not tell you what they earned that XP for. One of them levelled up while he was standing in the street doing nothing.\n\nThe line of sight the guards employ is a mystery to me. The tutorial suggests that staying out of light keeps you hidden, but this does not seem to be consistent. I have no idea what the guards' range of sight is. I have to assumed infinite, i.e. if you can see them, they can see you. I can't count the number of times a previously succesfully infriltration was ended by a single random guard able to see me from some unclear position.\n\nSInce, the original syndicate was not really a stealth game, I have also tried going in guns blazing but have found this to be a path to certain death. I have made some progress in shooting matches but only by grinding and failing the same missions over and over again to get enough XP and equipment to make my agents competitive. This is not a fun way to play games for me.\n\nEven having completed some missions I was quite unsatisfied. Many of these can be completed by rushing the main objective and getting killed in the process. Doesn't matter, the mission completion is still ticked off and you get a well done when your dead agents respawn. This is not a satisfying way to pull off a heist.\n\nIn summary I can't recommend a strategy game that does not give you sufficient information to play strategically. Guard lines of sight should be clear or displayed. enemy patrols should be in some way predictable. Given that even the slightest sighting gives all guards ESP to your current and future positions, until you have retreated from the entire mission area it forces you to play all heists on a kind of Ironman mode. You have to do it all perfectly first time.\n\nI would agree that there is an argument to say that the Satellite Reign approach is "realistic", but in reality four agents cannot successfully assault a fortress with surveillance cameras and an endless supply of guards and hover drones. I just prefer games to be a representative experience of player levers and rewards. I'm less interested in this game as a simulator.\n\nIt's hard to know whether the faults of Satellite Reign are elements of polish that are missing or fundamental gameplay faults that should have been corrected at the design stage, but as this version stands I can't recommend it as more than a paean to a former classic and a wonderful tech demo, leaving me to wonder how much more it could be with gaming added to it.","January 20","false","11.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/123bigyid/recommended/268870/","123bigyid","Someone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/123bigyid/","246 products in account","Remember Deus Ex? The gameplay in this is very similar, only instead of playing a first person cyberpunk, you control a team of FOUR cyberpunks, with different augmentations and abilities you can upgrade. Sneak past patrols, make silent takedowns, steal data from corporations and fight your way out when you get spotted. Like Deus Ex, each area has multiple entrances and paths to the objective. You must plan a route through patrols, hazards and one-way entry points, to infiltrate, and also exfiltrate with the loot and minimum casualties.\n\nInstead of missions, you get a cool little sandbox metropolis, spotted with guarded compounds your team can infiltrate, and hiding spots for when they get out with the loot. There's an alert level system similar to cops in GTA, and a public/restricted area system similar to Hitman.\n\nThis game deserves more sales than it has, because it does a very rare thing: provide emergent gameplay with multiple solutions to every problem. For example, here's a list of ways you can get past a locked gate:\n1) Hack the control terminal - requires hacking level, takes a few seconds, hacker may get spotted.\n2) Blow the door up - loud, every patrol will come running, but the door will be gone.\n3) Slip in when a patrol opens it - use cloaking, or just kill them all once you're inside.\n4) Do side objectives - many missions will let you gain access by bribing or "persuading" someone on the inside.\n5) Mind-control a guard and make him open it - for bonus points, make him cover you while your team scarpers off into the ducts and catwalks\nMore importantly, you can't always use the same one, you have to apply different methods depending on the situation and area layout.\nSimilarly, there are multiple ways to deal with enemies, and to move around restricted areas, and at one point or another you have to use each one. Stealth is important: you can't just say '♥♥♥♥ it', kill all the guards and stroll through an empty base, reinforcements will keep coming to your last known location, getting stronger until they overwhelm you. You must stay undetected, use distractions, stealth takedowns or hit-and-run tactics - wipe out a patrol and run away or hide before reinforcements come.\n\nStill not convinced?\nRemember X-Com? This game has a similar upgrade system: you steal prototypes for weapons, body augments and extra gear from missions, and research them to equip your agents. Gear customization is important: bigger guns, better stats, special kit like decoy grenades, lung augments that let you move through hazardous gas, cloaking systems and zipline attachments. You only have so many slots, so fit your agents to your playstyle wisely. On top of that, you level up each agent's unique skills.\n\nThe music is fantastic, the graphics are pretty and detailed, and the gameplay is great - moderately challenging and addictive.\n\nSo what's bad?\nThe story is almost nonexistent. Your starting goal is to gain access to the offices of the corp controlling the world, and beef your agents up enough to knock the place over, so your corp can control the world instead. That's really all there is to it, you get some background information about the city, corps, rivalries and internal struggles from mission descriptions and text logs, but none of it concerns you or your goal. Worse, you're not even your corp's boss, you're just some middle manager, doing evil things so someone ELSE can achieve world domination. If you want a richly detailed world, a plot full of twisted conspiracies and hidden agendas, or just wanted to imagine yourself as the evil, rich CEO taking over the world, you won't find it here.\n\nAlso, the game is in full real time, with (almost) no pause. It has been very deliberately designed this way, and I think it works well, but it might turn off some people. You can see the layout of each base and create a plan before you go in, but once you're in - it's go time. You can get an ability that slows time to a crawl, but it only works for a few seconds, and only really useful during combat.\n\nSo them's the breaks. This game punishes reckless rushing. It demands careful planning and swift execution, and also quick thinking and improvisation when your plan goes wrong (it always does). It rewards cleverness in using its complex, intervowen systems of movement, special skills and abilities, guard AI and level features. Games that do this are rare, and very hard to make. It's amazing how a team of 5 managed to pull it off so well, and such efforts in this industry must be rewarded.","January 7","true","30.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is a micromanagement simulator in real time. Your troops will do almost nothing if you don't tell them to. They won't even return fire in a lot of situations. So you have to be VERY busy while you're in a mission area.\n\nThe UI is SO CLUNKY. Finding the info or panels you need sometimes feels like it's own mission in game and forget about complicated troop movement. You're taking constant shots while you try to get your cursor to align with a wall correctly so that your men will move to cover instead of stand up and get shot in the face repeatedly. All my success has been based on finding a strong location to fight from, and pulling enemies to it. Movement under fire is most often suicide. And while I can appreciate the Realism of that, it certainly makes a very slow game.\n\nOnce you get a couple level ups on your agents things start to go much more smoothly as you have some desperately needed tools in your arsenal, but the opening was utterly demoralizing. The only thing that is going to get you through is either a fondness for dying or an overwhelming love of cyberpunk.\n\nIf you DO love Cyberpunk, however; you are in for a treat. The environment of the game is just excellent from the dingy alleys to the neon skyscrapers. Did they reinvent the wheel? No. It looks like every other cyber-whatever I've played. But it's still very pretty. Sadly, it's the mechanics of the thing that bog it down. If they ever open it up to the modding community I think it could be my Game of the Year, but it NEEDS work to really be a Finished Game. Work that I don't really think is coming. Most games on this sort of budget have to claw their way just to get a release build and then the development money is gone. I think this game is being presented 'As Is' and the Kickstart studio likely going their seperate ways.","September 7, 2015","true","13.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Satellite Reign is honestly one of the best strategy games of 2015. Created by some of the folks behind the original Syndicate and its sequel Syndicate Wars, you can definitely tell there was a lot of passion behind this project. Showcasing ideas and visuals they couldn't do in the past to to the limitations of the time. Aside from a few technichal issues the game is a wonderful experience.\n\nPros:\n+Gorgeous visuals and art direction\n+Easy to understand mechanics\n+Huge lovingly crafted open world with multiple routes to accomplish objectives\n+Fantastic and thematically appropriate soundtrack\n+Plenty of Weapons and skills to customize your agents.\n\nCons:\n-Needs optimization\n-Agent cosmetic customization is a bit lacking.\n-Arguably slow in the beginning as your agents are hilariously weak.\n\nIf your a fan of the original Syndicate and its sequel Syndicate Wars your gonna love this, If you like strategy games with RPG elements your gonna love this. Its got the graphics, gameplay and the challenge for anyone willing to give it a shot.","August 5, 2015","true","46.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/123bigyid/recommended/268870/","123bigyid","Someone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/123bigyid/","246 products in account","Remember Deus Ex? The gameplay in this is very similar, only instead of playing a first person cyberpunk, you control a team of FOUR cyberpunks, with different augmentations and abilities you can upgrade. Sneak past patrols, make silent takedowns, steal data from corporations and fight your way out when you get spotted. Like Deus Ex, each area has multiple entrances and paths to the objective. You must plan a route through patrols, hazards and one-way entry points, to infiltrate, and also exfiltrate with the loot and minimum casualties.\n\nInstead of missions, you get a cool little sandbox metropolis, spotted with guarded compounds your team can infiltrate, and hiding spots for when they get out with the loot. There's an alert level system similar to cops in GTA, and a public/restricted area system similar to Hitman.\n\nThis game deserves more sales than it has, because it does a very rare thing: provide emergent gameplay with multiple solutions to every problem. For example, here's a list of ways you can get past a locked gate:\n1) Hack the control terminal - requires hacking level, takes a few seconds, hacker may get spotted.\n2) Blow the door up - loud, every patrol will come running, but the door will be gone.\n3) Slip in when a patrol opens it - use cloaking, or just kill them all once you're inside.\n4) Do side objectives - many missions will let you gain access by bribing or "persuading" someone on the inside.\n5) Mind-control a guard and make him open it - for bonus points, make him cover you while your team scarpers off into the ducts and catwalks\nMore importantly, you can't always use the same one, you have to apply different methods depending on the situation and area layout.\nSimilarly, there are multiple ways to deal with enemies, and to move around restricted areas, and at one point or another you have to use each one. Stealth is important: you can't just say '♥♥♥♥ it', kill all the guards and stroll through an empty base, reinforcements will keep coming to your last known location, getting stronger until they overwhelm you. You must stay undetected, use distractions, stealth takedowns or hit-and-run tactics - wipe out a patrol and run away or hide before reinforcements come.\n\nStill not convinced?\nRemember X-Com? This game has a similar upgrade system: you steal prototypes for weapons, body augments and extra gear from missions, and research them to equip your agents. Gear customization is important: bigger guns, better stats, special kit like decoy grenades, lung augments that let you move through hazardous gas, cloaking systems and zipline attachments. You only have so many slots, so fit your agents to your playstyle wisely. On top of that, you level up each agent's unique skills.\n\nThe music is fantastic, the graphics are pretty and detailed, and the gameplay is great - moderately challenging and addictive.\n\nSo what's bad?\nThe story is almost nonexistent. Your starting goal is to gain access to the offices of the corp controlling the world, and beef your agents up enough to knock the place over, so your corp can control the world instead. That's really all there is to it, you get some background information about the city, corps, rivalries and internal struggles from mission descriptions and text logs, but none of it concerns you or your goal. Worse, you're not even your corp's boss, you're just some middle manager, doing evil things so someone ELSE can achieve world domination. If you want a richly detailed world, a plot full of twisted conspiracies and hidden agendas, or just wanted to imagine yourself as the evil, rich CEO taking over the world, you won't find it here.\n\nAlso, the game is in full real time, with (almost) no pause. It has been very deliberately designed this way, and I think it works well, but it might turn off some people. You can see the layout of each base and create a plan before you go in, but once you're in - it's go time. You can get an ability that slows time to a crawl, but it only works for a few seconds, and only really useful during combat.\n\nSo them's the breaks. This game punishes reckless rushing. It demands careful planning and swift execution, and also quick thinking and improvisation when your plan goes wrong (it always does). It rewards cleverness in using its complex, intervowen systems of movement, special skills and abilities, guard AI and level features. Games that do this are rare, and very hard to make. It's amazing how a team of 5 managed to pull it off so well, and such efforts in this industry must be rewarded.","January 7","true","30.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It will be a short review.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst: 8/10\n\nThis game is all in all pretty great. I was first considering not to buy it at all - I didn't know what I will get from buying this.\nIt's a game like the older game 'Commander' (was it called like that?), were you  command your soldiers behind enemy lines in an isometric view. Every soldier for themselves with special features and tricks. Not like Company of Heroes!\nBut this game happens in the future, with loads and lots of loadouts and gear and other crazy stuff. There's almost no voicing story but some short texts - reading is the most thing you'll need to do to get behind the story.\nThe gameplay is pretty great - there is no pausebutton were you can give your soldiers a command. But your supportunit can slow down time to help you with that. But don't get me wrong - you can always press escape and pause into game menu, but you can't give any commands here! It makes this game all in all a bit more challenging - talking about challenge: the game is not easy. But it is fair. Shooting your way through will not be possible, you really need to be strategic and consinder different tactics.\nIt is an open world game - so you can do sidequest after sidequest before going to other districts and do your job there.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBuy it, if you liked XCOM. Buy it, if you like strategy games with being tactical. Buy it, if you need something to fill the gab until XCOM 2. Buy it if you love a future setting.\n\n8/10!","September 4, 2015","true","12.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I am pleased the developers whave introduced the slow mo stims for players at the start as although I am not using this I can see why people want a real time tactical pause.\n\nI can understand if players are confused and frustrated at the start of the game, but please stick at it as its a wonderful game, but It could just do with a bit more user friendly at the start for younger gamers who have'nt played this type of genre before, but I suppose the game was pitched at old gits like me. Hopefully this will sell decent, but I think it was a bad time to release it out of early access. With Metal Gear Solid and Mad Max a similiar time, PC gamers need this style of games, but hopefully this will attract a younger crowd.","September 10, 2015","true","32.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I missed a squad of cyborg killers wreaking havoc in a city that looked like a cross between a scrap yard and an adroid roller disco - until now! Thank you 5 Lives. I hope my cash hurled at railgun velocity is the thanks you are after.  Here's some more...\n\nNice squad mechanic - I'm a fan of the specialists.  I did get caught with my kevlar cyberkecks down a few times by sending the wrong agents to the wrong parts of a secure area (it's not Syndicate!), and wandering into security cameras (Not Syndicate!) but gradually turning the 4 sociopaths into a well oiled machine, while waiting to see if they get well oiled machine parts to match (like Syndicate!).\n\nPROS: Squad based mayhem, tactical thinking (as per Commandos), guns akimbo rampage action, cover based combat for those "oops, blew my cover" moments, stealth, sneak kills, tactical thinking, asset securing (increase income for victory), fast travel to avoid excessive running (while avoiding cheating during the 5:50 moments). You can't save once you're committed to doing something suspicious, which adds to the tension - "Did I make the right choice? What about now? What if I do...eek! Alarms! Well, will have to use my brain then".\n\nCONS: Not heard anybody yell "Get Down!" yet. Plus I thought my soldier agent had undergone gender realignment on the fly until I worked out the cloning mechanics.\n\nGreat job, great game.  Looking forward to hurling cash at the DLC/Sequel, and I really like the news from the team on bug handling - read before I bought, seemed conscientious.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/123bigyid/recommended/268870/","123bigyid","Someone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/123bigyid/","246 products in account","Remember Deus Ex? The gameplay in this is very similar, only instead of playing a first person cyberpunk, you control a team of FOUR cyberpunks, with different augmentations and abilities you can upgrade. Sneak past patrols, make silent takedowns, steal data from corporations and fight your way out when you get spotted. Like Deus Ex, each area has multiple entrances and paths to the objective. You must plan a route through patrols, hazards and one-way entry points, to infiltrate, and also exfiltrate with the loot and minimum casualties.\n\nInstead of missions, you get a cool little sandbox metropolis, spotted with guarded compounds your team can infiltrate, and hiding spots for when they get out with the loot. There's an alert level system similar to cops in GTA, and a public/restricted area system similar to Hitman.\n\nThis game deserves more sales than it has, because it does a very rare thing: provide emergent gameplay with multiple solutions to every problem. For example, here's a list of ways you can get past a locked gate:\n1) Hack the control terminal - requires hacking level, takes a few seconds, hacker may get spotted.\n2) Blow the door up - loud, every patrol will come running, but the door will be gone.\n3) Slip in when a patrol opens it - use cloaking, or just kill them all once you're inside.\n4) Do side objectives - many missions will let you gain access by bribing or "persuading" someone on the inside.\n5) Mind-control a guard and make him open it - for bonus points, make him cover you while your team scarpers off into the ducts and catwalks\nMore importantly, you can't always use the same one, you have to apply different methods depending on the situation and area layout.\nSimilarly, there are multiple ways to deal with enemies, and to move around restricted areas, and at one point or another you have to use each one. Stealth is important: you can't just say '♥♥♥♥ it', kill all the guards and stroll through an empty base, reinforcements will keep coming to your last known location, getting stronger until they overwhelm you. You must stay undetected, use distractions, stealth takedowns or hit-and-run tactics - wipe out a patrol and run away or hide before reinforcements come.\n\nStill not convinced?\nRemember X-Com? This game has a similar upgrade system: you steal prototypes for weapons, body augments and extra gear from missions, and research them to equip your agents. Gear customization is important: bigger guns, better stats, special kit like decoy grenades, lung augments that let you move through hazardous gas, cloaking systems and zipline attachments. You only have so many slots, so fit your agents to your playstyle wisely. On top of that, you level up each agent's unique skills.\n\nThe music is fantastic, the graphics are pretty and detailed, and the gameplay is great - moderately challenging and addictive.\n\nSo what's bad?\nThe story is almost nonexistent. Your starting goal is to gain access to the offices of the corp controlling the world, and beef your agents up enough to knock the place over, so your corp can control the world instead. That's really all there is to it, you get some background information about the city, corps, rivalries and internal struggles from mission descriptions and text logs, but none of it concerns you or your goal. Worse, you're not even your corp's boss, you're just some middle manager, doing evil things so someone ELSE can achieve world domination. If you want a richly detailed world, a plot full of twisted conspiracies and hidden agendas, or just wanted to imagine yourself as the evil, rich CEO taking over the world, you won't find it here.\n\nAlso, the game is in full real time, with (almost) no pause. It has been very deliberately designed this way, and I think it works well, but it might turn off some people. You can see the layout of each base and create a plan before you go in, but once you're in - it's go time. You can get an ability that slows time to a crawl, but it only works for a few seconds, and only really useful during combat.\n\nSo them's the breaks. This game punishes reckless rushing. It demands careful planning and swift execution, and also quick thinking and improvisation when your plan goes wrong (it always does). It rewards cleverness in using its complex, intervowen systems of movement, special skills and abilities, guard AI and level features. Games that do this are rare, and very hard to make. It's amazing how a team of 5 managed to pull it off so well, and such efforts in this industry must be rewarded.","January 7","true","30.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It will be a short review.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst: 8/10\n\nThis game is all in all pretty great. I was first considering not to buy it at all - I didn't know what I will get from buying this.\nIt's a game like the older game 'Commander' (was it called like that?), were you  command your soldiers behind enemy lines in an isometric view. Every soldier for themselves with special features and tricks. Not like Company of Heroes!\nBut this game happens in the future, with loads and lots of loadouts and gear and other crazy stuff. There's almost no voicing story but some short texts - reading is the most thing you'll need to do to get behind the story.\nThe gameplay is pretty great - there is no pausebutton were you can give your soldiers a command. But your supportunit can slow down time to help you with that. But don't get me wrong - you can always press escape and pause into game menu, but you can't give any commands here! It makes this game all in all a bit more challenging - talking about challenge: the game is not easy. But it is fair. Shooting your way through will not be possible, you really need to be strategic and consinder different tactics.\nIt is an open world game - so you can do sidequest after sidequest before going to other districts and do your job there.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBuy it, if you liked XCOM. Buy it, if you like strategy games with being tactical. Buy it, if you need something to fill the gab until XCOM 2. Buy it if you love a future setting.\n\n8/10!","September 4, 2015","true","12.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

If you can forgive a few glitches and some occasional NPC stupidity it is well worth the price. See the “The Verdict” section for a short list of pro’s and cons.\n\nIntro - What is the game about?Satellite Reign takes place in a cyberpunk world ruled by corporations rather than governments. Your objective is to to overthrow the Dracogenics company and overtake their resurrection network of satellites. This is mostly a background for the game though - during the game the story itself is thin so do not expect an opus magnum quality novel. A few spoken notes at the start of each district and some background text from hacked terminals is pretty much al the story that is availible.\n\nYou play the game as a squad of four characters, each with its own specialization and talents. You are free to upgrade your characters as you wish – a single play trough will most definitely not unlock all their skills – even half may be out of reach. Aside from that you customize their weapons, tools, armor and the like. These tools partially mimic other class abilities so you can create a pretty neat customized squad, perfect for your playing style.\n\nThe gameplay itself resolves around breaching ever-more-difficult compounds on the map, looting them for money and gear prototypes you can then use to support your own soldiers. Money can either be spend on new weapons or researching the gear you found so you can duplicate it. Aside from that it is only used for bribes to make objectives simpler or to bypass sections of the game.\n\nInfiltration – Silent as a shadow or loud and clear?Infiltrating compounds can be done through both stealth and brute force, both of which have their advantages and disadvantages. Going silent allows you to bypass difficult fights entirely, but being caught can be quite lethal. Going loud could get you swarmed with enemies, but it will create a clear path with little surprises behind you.\n\nBoth paths are surprisingly well developed and complemented by the available gear and skills. Players focusing on stealth will develop skills that allow them to access high vents  and ziplines, which can bypass areas of the map. Loud players will not want to waste points on these skills and will instead take a different path using skills that increate damage. Regardless of your gametype there are always multiple paths to a single objective, which always creates a tactical consideration: Will I just blow up those turrets and then fortify myself for a fight, or so I take one of those two routes around them and risk being spotted and ganged up by half the base?\n\nThe verdict – Pro’s and Con’s\nPros\nOpen world gameplay:  The entire world is accessible from the start of the game and there is no loading screen whatsoever during gameplay, not even when switching zones in the city.\nOutstanding visual quality: The world is exceptionally well designed. Visual quality is very high, and of such variety that you will have difficulty finding area’s that look alike.\nCustomization: The character customization can personalize a squad to your wishes, with sufficient options to make them feel “Unique”\nReplay value: My stealth and loud games feel sufficiently different to warrant another playtrough. Even a third which mixes skills from both might be an option.\nWell optimized: My current system is medium specced at best. The game runs flawlessly with a high framerate trough, and looks very appealing.\nPlaying around: Hijacking 5 citizens and setting them on a guard is never boring, nor is causing a fight between two corporations. Neither will luring a set of guards to a spot with gunfire before throwing a grenade get old. Plenty of tactics around that are fun just because they are possible.\nNeutral\nGame time: My first stealth game took about 40 hours to complete, though I did play around with the game world a lot rather than progressing. My second loud playtrough is going faster. All in all I suspect most players will find around 20-30 hours’ worth of time in a single play trough. Less if you are rushing, more if you are playing around.\nCons\nThe AI:  The AI in the game can be rather dumb at times. If you find a dead body you shouldn’t charge in on your own. If you are in a gunfight, you don’t pell-mell trough the gunfire to take cover near the enemy. If you chase an enemy at the heart of your base you don’t search a minute on your own and return to patrol afterwards without even raising the alarm.\nPathfinding: You will see NPC’s running into closed doors or standing in from of them without taking the 10 second detour around. You will see your men cut corners to shortly only for them to stagger into the terrain. You will see your own soldiers and enemies run into standing cars. It is not always a problem, but often enough to take note off.\nGlitches: Hijacked civilians can run through closed doors if they sprint to them. Citizens entering vents can end up exiting in mid-air instead of the other end. Positioning between walls and objects can glitch you inside the building or wall. Again somewhat rare and you can always correct it yourself, but definitely an immersion breaker.\nThe open world: The world is well designed, but feels somewhat devoid of objectives at times. You travel trough it to reach compounds and wander around it for ATM's, terminals and scientists and the occasional quest objective. These are one-off's though. A few procedurally generated and repeatable side missions to assasinate a squad or breach an enemy compound might have been fun to keep wandering around more interesting.\nAll in all I can heartily recommend this game both at a discount and at its full price. Visually the game is excellent. Both the gameplay and level design is done well enough to support a variety of tactics and play styles – there is no “Only” or “Best” way to play the game. If you can forgive its quirks and glitches it will make up with the rest it has to offer.","September 5, 2015","true","52.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I bought it for two reasons: firstly because I was a fan of Syndicate back in the day, even though I sucked at it and probably still do; and secondly, because a friend of mine tried to get me into the Netrunner card game, which I would have liked to do if I had the cash to burn and the guarantee of regular matches in my MtG loving country.\n\nBut I digress. This seems pretty cool so far. The system for hijacking agents and cloning them is a bit confusing --- actually, no, it's very confusing, and the un-intuitive interface doesn't help. I'd recommend checking out some YouTube vids explaining it. Otherwise, everything else is easy enough to figure out with a bit of tinkering.\n\nIt's great fun. I tend to play it as a top-down stealth game, but I'm still rather early in - and I'll explain why momentarily - but on the whole, it's great fun circling compounds trying to find all the access points and planning which route you're going to take and such. It might get to the point later where I'll have to beef up and take a more combative approach to some missions, though.\n\nThe reason I'm not too far is because the game is fairly stable (on my Windows 10 PC) until I try to load a game. Then a crash is about 50/50 likely to occur. Maybe this has been fixed in the cloth dynamics patch. I'll have to check.\n\nBut on the whole, if you liked Syndicate, and could do with that kind of gameplay in an open world, be sure to check it out.","December 20, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The aesthetics, the music, the angles everything is very much Syndicate Wars 2.0, sadly this includes not only the good parts, but also some of the warts.\n\nOnce the action really gets going, it can frankly be impossible to react, not only because stuff can happen in the blink of an eye, but also because agents are often very unwilling to abandon actions they're already in the process of executing, and because if two things that can be interacted with overlap, the game sometimes insists that what you REALLY want to do is click that vent, not the enemy trying to gun you down. Agents also aren't terribly clever, they occasionally have navigation issues, and you'll NEVER want to use rocket launchers, because they rarely think to shoot OVER or AROUND obstructions immediately in front of them(and there's no indication of the rocket's trajectory or blast radius to you, the player, though there is for usable items such as grenades. Perhaps the rocket launcher and its siblings should have been usable items, not main weapons, if it's an issue with the interface?).\n\nThere are also a few weird bugs left over, largely related to extreme height differences. For instance, I had an escort mission where an escort, upon entering a vent would, rather than leaving its exit point, leave its exit point... but be severely displaced on the Y axis, resulting in me not being able to take him on the same path as my agents.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed Satellite Reign, though it was definitely at its best when I could maintain stealth, because the combat... wasn't very fun. The weapon stats almost all looked basically the same, with few indicators of when something was more efficient than something else, and combat tended to be over pretty quickly in any case, because there was rarely any strategy that worked better than liberally spamming grenades(crazily overpowered if you maxed your Soldier's ability to carry and use them) and then focusing fire on the survivors(you rarely have any real reason to split up your guys except in the early game before they can all use the same navigation options thanks to augmentations, so focus fire is an option in 99% of all cases).\n\nTriggering an alarm was also often not a huge deal, even without silencers it was often possible to just off the guards with no reinforcements coming, and at worst it was an extra wave or two. On the one hand I like that one mistake didn't send me zooming off to the quickload button like in some stealth-involving games, but on the other hand sometimes it felt just a tad TOO forgiving, too.\n\nThe AI also tended to have some weird decision-making at times, triggering random repercussions against civilians and even inter-factionally(as another group than the one owning a given compound would sometimes show up to investigate destroyed security cameras there).\n\nThe ending was also a major letdown. It was over just a bit too quickly, though thankfully it maintained a health level of challenge(getting cocky almost got me totally gibbed), and then the "reward" at the end  was just hearing some British woman yelling swear words and insisting that "She" betrayed us! Oh no! And then everyone explodes. Considering that I could probably figure out who "She" was, and who the British lady was, from reading plot snippets discovered during the game, it's not exactly out of left field but... "She" never features in the actual gameplay at all, and the British lady's only function is to chatter during the tutorial and then at the end of each city district.\n\nThe setting obviously had a decent bit of writing and thought put into it, but most of what you encounter, setting-wise is just in text snippets... you never really interact with any of the major players(bar one, at the very end), and functionally the factions are much the same except for their outfits and that one of them seems to deploy big minigunners a bit sooner than the other two. It would have been nice if the game had done more showing and less telling.\n\nUltimately, this review is pretty critical, so it may sound like I'm going to NOT recommend the game... but I can't in all honesty do that. It easily dragged me in for hours at a time, and I guess that the reason the issues it had grated on me as much as they did was because it was really, really close to being really, really great. As it is, though, it's just decent.","October 15, 2015","true","15.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Pausing respawning all enemies in the world, for example. Soldiers aiming in a completely different direction than their indended target. Soldiers refusing to move or shoot, and getting stuck in place or in terrain.\n* The game has a poor progression system - that is, linear. There is no reason to use Plasma over Laser based weaponry, for example, when both are unlocked so close to one another. The game pauses during inactivity, which hinders the research function whenever you are waiting before infiltrating an enemy region.\n* The story is next-to non-existent, as is the environmental interaction.\n* There are traces of unfinished features all over the game, leaving a feeling of yearning for what could have been. Vehicles are present, but pose no threat and serve no purpose.\n* The relay system should have been either removed or toned down drastically.\n* While there are plenty of hotkeys, some of the more trivial tasks that one must always do in momments of fast-paced high-risk action seem to have been overlooked.\n* Certain graphics settings have either no effect on the visuals or frame-rate, even when disabled.\n* Lack of narrative progression after tutorial and before the final "boss."\n* Lack of enemy variety.\n* Enemies do not use many tactics, and are keen to sit and shoot until killed.\n\nNow, the good.\n* Exceptionally long game. Each area takes roughly 10 hours to complete on a speed run.\n* Customizable difficulty. This makes the stealth-play far more important, and removes the triviality of death.\n* Good setting, but not fleshed out due to lack of interaction with it and the limited civilian life. There are also no indoor areas.\n* Has potential for modding.\n* Better than Syndicate, this game's predecessor.\n* Excellent character growth; difference between beginning characters' weakness and ending characters' strength is outstanding. Blowing up even the hardest, largest enemies in mere seconds in amazing.\n\nOverall, I give the game a 4/10. I wanted to like it, but it just feels like it needed another year of design and programming.","February 5","false","41.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Just state the reason I cannot finish it:\n\n1. Your soildier has no AI at all. You have to manage their position, target and skills in the battle. You might even need to split them in different places and multitask. The developer assumes every player of the game is a professional Starcraft II player and refuse to let me pause and give command. Yes, the supporter has a skill to mimic that but you know that is not what I mean.\n\n2. Stealth gameplay is also broken. Guards' patrol route is completely random. It is very ambiguous where their line of sight can reach and how light and cover affect their vision. Still due to the lack of pause, it is vert difficult to split your team and cooperate efficiently. This engine does not fit for stealth gameplay at all. It is like being forced to play a stealth game in an real time strategy game.\n\n3. The game is filled with Ubisoft-style activity. Establishing stations all over the map as a fast travel spot; hack ATM all over the map to give your constant currency flow; go to kill an npc which is the same as hundreds of other npcs in the map...\n\n4. I have reached CBD. The story is neither good or bad, because it does not exist. Every thing out there, organizations, citizens, governments, soildiers, has no life. The only thing that exist in this game are augments, gears and weapons. I like them actually, but when they become the center and purpose of the game, that means a very interesting cyberpunk set up is wasted.","April 1","false","26.0"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

Use your agents to sneak, shoot, steal, and sabotage your way up the corporate ladder, and take control of the most powerful monopoly of all time.\n\nEach of your agents can be tailored toward your favoured play-style, while still maintaining their own unique specialisations.

The world and story are rich and deep. There is almost no story telling but you do feel like you progress into a story you create yourself.\n\nEvery gameplay systems are well thought and well put together. The skill and augmentation systems works perfectly with the few objects you can interact in the world. The combat is kinda meh but rewarding and challenging.\n\nI guess that technically speaking the game could use some optimization.\n\nAfter you finish the tutorial you are free to decide what to do and how to do it. I spent literally hours to carefully craft plans for a full stealth mission. Of course it would rarely go well and the mission would either end up in messy success or in a general retreat.\nOverall the game is immense fun. A full cyberpunk city of fun. I am not too familiar with the old Syndicates games but Satelite Reign is a good game in its own rights. I wish they release some extra districts or cities via DLC or that they give us some development tools to mod it ourselves.\n\n----------------8<-------------[ cut here ]------------------\n\nEditing my review to tone it down a little bit.\n\nI am still having great fun with the game and I still recommend it heartidly BUT be warned that there are indeed a lot of bugs between you and the endgame and I can now understand why some people would give it a bad review.\nCharacter get stuck randomly or get under the map etc. One bug in particular is preventing me from getting 100 achivements.

Not only is the stealth system completely broken (guards will randomly charge your hiding spot from a mile way to shoot you without changing into the "noticed" light scheme, while you could walk up right behind them in a different spot), but the difficulty and balance scale is a serious concern.\nThis game gives your characters guns but it is pointless to use them because you can never win a shoot-out! NEVER! They will only call endless hordes against you (even after completing the operation that makes it 50% reduced reinforcement speed), and even the low-level guards in the first major zone are easily over powered over your pathetic agents that can't kill them faster than they can raise the alarm.\nOn top of the glitches and line of sight imbalances, you can only save when outside of secure compounds. There are so many chances to make a mistake and some compounds are gigantic and can take hours to fully sneak around. This current save system makes it impossible to complete some compounds without giving up in frustration and seems to only be a "punitive" system, a barrier against player freedom and enjoyment for no good foreseeable reason.\n\n2/10, and that 2 is for the hot sci-fi chicks in the posters on the streets.\n","February 10","false","6.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I don't have the time to invest in games that are not user-friendly.\n\nI don't mean easy, I mean intuitive and clear.\n\nDanger signs were there when the tutorial wanted me to draw a weapon. I did, but it kept asking me to draw my gun like an inverted ED-209. After a bit of walking around - right up to a guard who didn't react -a gun sight appeared and I somehow managed to shoot my opponent.\n\nThe tutorial didn't recognise the guard was dead (I was still being asked to draw my weapon). The exit was locked. A pop up making some quasi-sarcastic comment about this was covered by another pop up asking me to draw my gun.\n\nSo, unable to get through the door and unsure of how to even get through the tutorial, I quit and wrote this.\n\nSure, this is almost likely my fault as I am sure I did something wrong. Or maybe there is a clear and simple control for opening doors.  But kinda it's not my problem. A tutorial should convey the basics of a game to any and every user.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paranoiasavedthecat/recommended/268870/","paranoiasavedthecat","paranoiasavedthecat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paranoiasavedthecat/","313 products in account","I want to preface this review with "This game could be a solid game, but it has a long road to achieve that."\n\nTo start with, and what I think is the most disturbing issue I've faced so far: there's something horribly wrong with how this game writes data to disk. The game locks up when loading/writing save files or game content. The graphic animations stop, the game gets jerky. It can, and will, lock up on you when it tries to overwrite your autosave file. When it does crash an autosave file its going to set you back hours of gameplay and I hope you had a backup save slot. If you didn't, well. That's unfortunate.\n\nThe other major problem I have with this game is the pathmapping and how the player interacts with the environment. Both are, well, they're bad. Use an ability while you have a unit in cover? They stand, but they don't return to cover. Now they're spotted. Any tile with multiple, overlapping, cover from different directions can sometimes render it impossible for you to select the cover direction you wanted. Unit decided to use the cover facing north instead of east? Now you're spotted (which leads me to question why units can only benefit from a singular direction of cover instead of two+ when utilizing corners. It makes sight-lines very awkward to predict). There are times when you must fight the camera to get cover ticks to appear so that your unit won't stand in the open. If you miss this opportunity they'll simply stand over the cover tile instead of actually getting in cover. Now you're spotted. The pathmapping doesn't properly recognize doors. If you click on a platform that has either a vent or a door between the two, you'll find your unit stopped, facing the wall instead of using the door or vent. If you're needing to escape this can cause you to lose units unnecessarily. Several units can "stack up" on one cover tile, which, while amusing and sometimes exploitable can be a serious problem. Having "run" be a double-click function of "walk" leads to an issue where your unit will stutter in animation and can lead to delays in getting a unit where you want it to go. Having a two-key run function instead of a one-key two-stroke would have been better as then you wouldn't get animation stutter nor would it slow your unit down.\n\nNot that this matters too much as the AI is just about as bad as the pathmapping. If you manage to hide in cover, even if the enemy knows exactly where you are and could easily walk around a corner or crate to engage you, they won't. They'll get into cover themselves, and eventually forget your existence. This leads to a rather exploitive gameplay style where instead of having to out think the AI, you just let it get bored and return to its predetermined routine and shoot it in the back of the head.\n\nThere is no point in upgrading guns or taking clones with any stat beyond run speed and energy. Once you have the silencers unlocked the standard pistol becomes the most dangerous weapon in the game. Any time you are engaged by the AI you can run, hide and allow them to forget your existence. If one does manage to engage simply have your hacker mind-control them and the rest will sit there until they disengage then silent kill all enemies.\n\nHonestly the game becomes very repetitive once you get good at manipulating its flaws. Its an endless cycle of equipment grinding, which, thanks to hte black market, its rather pointless. You can simply hijack all the ATMs, have your units sit somewhere safe, then walk away from the game and allow it to grind cash for you. Go make a sandwich. Read a book. Play Poke'mon. Then, when you're done, come back. Buy the blackmarket upgrades. You're not punished or penalized for this style of play. It saves you from having to grind out missions to get the gear that you could simply wait and obtain anyway.\n\nIf these issues were addressed I'd be happy to change this review. I don't think it will happen. While the development team is active in fixing bugs, they seem to be struggling with issues that crop up... and what I've complained about would require complete overhauls for how the game handles objects, cover, pathmapping and AI. If they're stuck on clothing crashing the game I don't think they're going to have the time, resources or talent to rebuild the game from the ground up. So it will remain flawed and my review will remain negative.","January 21","false","18.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

I was disappointed when I got my hands on the fruits of their labour. Don't get me wrong the graphics are decent, as are aspects of the gameplay, but the finished product had some bugs (incompletable missions etc) and was quite expensive considering it felt quite short in comparison to syndicate wars. The game play quickly becomes quite repetitive as there isn't much variety in terms of missions once you've completed the first area of play. In syndicate wars you could play through as both the goodies and the baddies, here no such luck.\n\nIf you want a bit of cyberpunk action you can dip in and out of then as they've worked out some of the kinks and the price has dropped, it could be worth a look.

Not only is the stealth system completely broken (guards will randomly charge your hiding spot from a mile way to shoot you without changing into the "noticed" light scheme, while you could walk up right behind them in a different spot), but the difficulty and balance scale is a serious concern.\nThis game gives your characters guns but it is pointless to use them because you can never win a shoot-out! NEVER! They will only call endless hordes against you (even after completing the operation that makes it 50% reduced reinforcement speed), and even the low-level guards in the first major zone are easily over powered over your pathetic agents that can't kill them faster than they can raise the alarm.\nOn top of the glitches and line of sight imbalances, you can only save when outside of secure compounds. There are so many chances to make a mistake and some compounds are gigantic and can take hours to fully sneak around. This current save system makes it impossible to complete some compounds without giving up in frustration and seems to only be a "punitive" system, a barrier against player freedom and enjoyment for no good foreseeable reason.\n\n2/10, and that 2 is for the hot sci-fi chicks in the posters on the streets.\n","February 10","false","6.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The exit was locked. A pop up making some quasi-sarcastic comment about this was covered by another pop up asking me to draw my gun.\n\nSo, unable to get through the door and unsure of how to even get through the tutorial, I quit and wrote this.\n\nSure, this is almost likely my fault as I am sure I did something wrong.

The game locks up when loading/writing save files or game content. The graphic animations stop, the game gets jerky. It can, and will, lock up on you when it tries to overwrite your autosave file. When it does crash an autosave file its going to set you back hours of gameplay and I hope you had a backup save slot. If you didn't, well. That's unfortunate.\n\nThe other major problem I have with this game is the pathmapping and how the player interacts with the environment. Both are, well, they're bad. Use an ability while you have a unit in cover? They stand, but they don't return to cover. Now they're spotted. Any tile with multiple, overlapping, cover from different directions can sometimes render it impossible for you to select the cover direction you wanted. Unit decided to use the cover facing north instead of east? Now you're spotted (which leads me to question why units can only benefit from a singular direction of cover instead of two+ when utilizing corners. It makes sight-lines very awkward to predict). There are times when you must fight the camera to get cover ticks to appear so that your unit won't stand in the open. If you miss this opportunity they'll simply stand over the cover tile instead of actually getting in cover. Now you're spotted. The pathmapping doesn't properly recognize doors. If you click on a platform that has either a vent or a door between the two, you'll find your unit stopped, facing the wall instead of using the door or vent. If you're needing to escape this can cause you to lose units unnecessarily. Several units can "stack up" on one cover tile, which, while amusing and sometimes exploitable can be a serious problem. Having "run" be a double-click function of "walk" leads to an issue where your unit will stutter in animation and can lead to delays in getting a unit where you want it to go. Having a two-key run function instead of a one-key two-stroke would have been better as then you wouldn't get animation stutter nor would it slow your unit down.\n\nNot that this matters too much as the AI is just about as bad as the pathmapping. If you manage to hide in cover, even if the enemy knows exactly where you are and could easily walk around a corner or crate to engage you, they won't. They'll get into cover themselves, and eventually forget your existence. This leads to a rather exploitive gameplay style where instead of having to out think the AI, you just let it get bored and return to its predetermined routine and shoot it in the back of the head.\n\nThere is no point in upgrading guns or taking clones with any stat beyond run speed and energy. Once you have the silencers unlocked the standard pistol becomes the most dangerous weapon in the game. Any time you are engaged by the AI you can run, hide and allow them to forget your existence. If one does manage to engage simply have your hacker mind-control them and the rest will sit there until they disengage then silent kill all enemies.\n\nHonestly the game becomes very repetitive once you get good at manipulating its flaws. Its an endless cycle of equipment grinding, which, thanks to hte black market, its rather pointless. You can simply hijack all the ATMs, have your units sit somewhere safe, then walk away from the game and allow it to grind cash for you. Go make a sandwich. Read a book. Play Poke'mon. Then, when you're done, come back. Buy the blackmarket upgrades. You're not punished or penalized for this style of play. It saves you from having to grind out missions to get the gear that you could simply wait and obtain anyway.\n\nIf these issues were addressed I'd be happy to change this review. I don't think it will happen. While the development team is active in fixing bugs, they seem to be struggling with issues that crop up... and what I've complained about would require complete overhauls for how the game handles objects, cover, pathmapping and AI. If they're stuck on clothing crashing the game I don't think they're going to have the time, resources or talent to rebuild the game from the ground up.

Not without issues. NOWHERE near perfect. But it was fun. It didn't drag on. I liked it and\neven hoped it would be a little longer. But overall I am happy that this game was created and I would kickstart the second game right away!\n\nIt has this nice dystopian feel, heavy cyberpunk, but the story is on the light side. It's more about tackling different areas, planning your way in and out or making sure you can efficiently eliminate all the threats.\n\nI'd personally give this game a 7/10 score, but if you don't care for the old titles or particularly enjoy the setting, you can drop 2 points.\n\nI know I had fun to the end of the game.

It sticks relatively close to the originals, so you have a reseach queue, you can upgrade your agents weapons and augmentations (body parts) and you can get gear. They have also added some extra features such as skills and cloning.\n\nMy gripe with this game is some of the stuff that they changed is worse, and also the lack gameplay features. Lets base the differences from Syndicate Wars, released a mere 20 years ago.\n\n\nThere is only one "team" to play\nYou cannot seem to drive cars/or blow them up\nInfact in Syndicate Wars lots of stuff was destructable, in SR basically nothing is\nNo flying cars\nNo huge tanks that shoot missiles at you or those huge spider tank things (infact there are spider tanks in Satellite Reign but they are patetic)\nLack of explosive stuff in general\nYou cannot pick up/drop weapons (this is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥)\nNo trains\n\n\n\nThe level design is also less creative, basically evert part of the game is the same in SR. The gameplay throughout is just very samey. Basically you go to various sectors of this one big city which all look the same, break into certain locations to gain stuff and thats pretty much all you do. There are very few missions that take place in the public areas, and the few that are will be to pick up a package or kill someone, they are straightfoward. No ambushing you, or surprising you like the old games did.\n\nThey have added a stealth system in, so when you enter locations you can disable security cameras etc, and sneak around, however it is clunky, to the point where jsut walking in and shooting is better. They have set it up so you can go through the vents or side passages or whatever, but there is little point when its easier jsut to walk in the front door shooting, and when did a Syndicate game become about stealth anyway??? The combat is slow compared to the old games. There are no also enemy agents, only police and security, which do differ in strength, however even the elite bad guys are no real threat and the only real threat is when you become outnumbered.\n\nThe tech tree is also messed up. The way the game works there doesnt appear to be any major order in which you gain tech, or for my playthrough, I ended up getting the second best weapon about a quater of the way through the game which means I only ever ended up using about 4 weapons in total. As you can easily jump ahead, most of the weapons/gear/augmentations effectively become redundant even before you get them, which is a shame.\n\nThey also want like £22 for this on Steam which for what you are getting, is a rip off. I got it on a deal but I would say unless you can get it really cheap dont bother.\n\nI know I've slagged it off pretty royaly, its actually not that bad, but Bullfrog did it much better.","January 24","false","31.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have been a long time supporter of this game from early kickstarter days and I am really disappointed in this studio.  It was brought to the developers attention very early on and constantly throughout the alpha and beta that the framerates and optimization were horrible for this game.  Every time the developers would respond with a one sentence response of "the game is cpu bound" with no explaination as to why or a fix for the performance issues.  Why on earth in 2015 would you make a game that is cpu bound.  The minimum and recommended system requirements are a joke, don't expect more than 20-30 fps with a system well above the recommended specs.

It's a matter of sinking down behind cover and witteling away at each other.  The lack of a 'pause' action is a TERRIBLE design choice as well.  It's needed when the enemies just sit there and spam attacks endlessly, not really using any tactics beyond that.  Controlling four players with unique abilities and each having their own 'niche' to fill during a combat encounter makes for a more frustrating experience than a fun one sadly.","August 29, 2015","false","3.4"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","9","20","0","0"

The game is clearly pretty badly optimized, as switching between Low and Ultra settings on my rather high-end PC barely did anything to my framerate. Disabling SSR (?) boosted my framerate from 30 to about 80, but considering the type of game it is and the quality of visuals, it should be running much better. I'm glad the game supports 120hz, but apparently it can't quite run at those framerates.\n\nI also quickly got frustrated with the unintuitive interface which seemed to get in the way. I'm sure with time I could get used to it, but as I didn't find things responding to my controls quite like I expected - if at all - it just wasn't worth the hassle for me when there are many other games out that don't have these problems.\n\nGames need to get their basics right because first impressions make all the difference.

I expected, from the video and screeshots, something like a mix of X-Com and Invisible Inc. What I found is... not that. Not sure what this game is about really.\n\nFirst from the start, the game "throws" you in with an introduction made from brief news extracts, and then you start the game itself. No clue why I'm here or what I'm supposed to be doing. I start through the tutorial, shooting a few guards along the way. The tutorial describes sneaking as "hey, now that you learned to shoot, let's try sneaking, it works too" or something similar. So I did. Next encounter, the tutorial let me do as I wish and I shot people.\n\nUntil the "end" of the tutorial, the game seems comprised of group of short connected rooms which each propose somewhat of a challenge (I suppose) and then you can go back wherever your "teleporter which rez people" are located. The game is very insisting about that part: my agents respawn.\n\nThen I suppose I finished the tutorial and got my first mission, "going to the police station" (maybe ?). I stopped there.\n\n\nProblem with this game is that its mechanics seem great at doing whatever they're supposed to do (they are responsive, there seem to be a good layer of interaction between the classes and with cover and map objects), but the game doesn't convey "WHY", as a player, I should do any of those things.\n\nStealth is the primary offender here. I litterally sat in the front of 2 guards with my 3 agents for 20+ seconds, they did nothing for some reason (the previous guards I found had to be passed or shot on sight), they I got little flashing red thingies when i got my weapons out and I decided to shoot them. None of my agents were even hurt. Is this really a stealth / infiltration game ?\n\nAlso, It needs more story. Who are these "guards" ? What are they guarding ? Do they are from a single corp ? Multiple corp ? Do every guard know my names & face ? Are we in a building or in a street ?\n\nMaybe there is a great game 20 hours in.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NamelessOblivion/recommended/268870/","NamelessOblivion","Nameless Oblivion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NamelessOblivion/","275 products in account","Okay, so let's talk.\n\nI liked Syndicate, and this game inspires a lot of the same feelings. Love the modern, lush depiction of what once was a sterile, dystopian society writ in abstract by the limits of graphical fidelity. I enjoy that they've tried to keep a significant portion of the game's variety of approach. I liked the small unit tactics, of the original, but most especially liked that you could complete most (indeed, eventually almost all) missions with the application of stupid amounts of boom.\n\nBut that was then, and this is now. So let's talk about how the game plays, right?\n\nPathfinding? Yeah, it's there, but it's not 100%. You'll have agents (as I just did, yet again) who fail to pathfind around the end of a chainlink fence, and instead end up dancing a pathfinding failure as they're gunned down in realtime, with you more or less helpless until you notice that they're spazzing instead of fighting back.\n\nSkill and character customization? Yeah, it's there, and the game adds its own wrinkle of sorts in the form of variable clone stats that you can take advantage of. It's not a major feature, but it adds a little edge. Of course, the developers fail to telegraph how certain design choices will play out vis-a-vis the support character - the lynchpin of the entire game and squad (but don't sprint).\n\nThe decision to opt for a triggered ability instead of a tactical pause sounds good, at first - it did to me too, and then you add cover for a more tactical game? Hell, the original Syndicate never had cover, so how could they get it wrong?\n\nWell.. this is where the train starts to leave the tracks.\n\nSee, in the original Syndicate, you could mod your agents hormonal levels, in order to "boost them" later by "nerfing them" early on. Effectively, you'd turn down an agent's adrenal response until you needed them to really kick it out, and then you'd light the whole system all the way to maximum, and in this way, you could make your agents superhuman when you needed it, and drop back to subnormal when you don't.\n\nSatellite Reign has opted to take this, and combine it with the design vision involving a total lack of a tactical pause, to create a realtime game where the enemies use cover effectively, and think 'independently', but you're expected to respond to this, in realtime, for four agents, who more or less don't think or act unless you explicitly tell them to, and that's bad, in realtime, if kill times get too short.\n\nSo why the big deal about a pause?\n\nWell, the original Syndicate also had a PAUSE KEY. Don't take my word for it. It's in the flippin' manual, fer cryin' out loud! This allows the player to compensate for a general lack of "I don't have eight hands or four separate brains to control every fine aspect of four avatars in realtime".\n\nSatellite Reign doesn't have one. It sounds good at first, but you quickly become reliant on the support class's stims to be able to manage the game's complexity and keep the clusterf----s controllable. See, your agents are stupid - they dont' take ANY actiosn you don't tell them to take. No AI. No taking cover. No firing back, no moving to a better location if LOS is blocked and they're shooting a lamp post or wall instead of a soft target.\n\nThat's bad alone, but then you add in the game's simply enormous emphasis on stealth play and cover, and suddenly you're playing as the only brain in a four-man squad in a tactical game with stealth elements and cover in realtime, everytime your stims are down, with agent avatars that have no volition. You're running an entire puppet troupe by yourself.\n\nOh - and you can't let the guy with the stims sprint, or he can't stim the group, because the devs have made the decision to totally constipate the class by using the same energy pool for sprinting as for stims - and so intead of being a feature of the player's control (as it is for a tactical pause, or even allowing the *PLAYER* to stim the group on a cooldown/timer) it's instead an unwanted bit-and-harness on the support class - if he's not hidden away, all your fights WILL happen around him, because he can't move away and disengage reliably at all while also permitting you to act like a controller for the agents.\n\n....and that's about where it falls flat, for me. Syndicate had a pause for a reason - controlling four units in tight micro, while also monitoring various abilities and trying to monitor the minimap begins to border on the nutbar level of "things to monitor at once". Something will give, and for me, that's my patience with this game.\n\nStims aren't pause, guys - and the game hurts for it. I'm sorry, you can claim "vision" but that doesn't polish a bad decision, and it cores out a game that otherwise feels like it will be fairly solid shortly (once the rough edges get a bit of a sanding). Maybe they'll relent or the modders will save them from their arrogance, but I'm not going to recommend a game I cannot enjoy, and this was definitely one of those.\n\n6/10, would only recommend for people with a deep seated need to hone their RTS micro, and not to fans of Syndicate. More style than substance, and several design decisions and buggy implementations mar what should otherwise have been a fantastic reboot and retelling of the Syndicate theme and tone.\n\nA shame, really.","September 1, 2015","false","23.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

However, it is so poorly optimised that frame rates drop as low as 10-15 fps at times.  This is seemingly random, as there doesn't appear to be any particular graphical effect, or very busy area that causes it, and dropping my resolution and turning off all effects and setting the graphics to low also doesn't resolve the problem.  I may not have the most high-end machine, but it can run games like Elite: Dangerous and Alien Isolation on ultra, and achieve 60 fps with no problem, and GTA V on medium at 60 FPS.  This game should not be taxing my GPU so much that it will drop below 20 FPS even on low graphics settings.\n\nAdditionally, there are areas where the cover system just does not work. Combine that with a clunky interface and you will often be frustrated by one of your agents running out into the open during a firefight, after you tried to command them to move to a different cover-location.  I could normally work round something like this, but Satellite Reign is so unforgiving that there is absolutely no room for mistakes.\n\nThere are suggestions that switching to the nightly build of the game might relieve some of these issues, but not so far.  I would wait a while for the devs to do better QA and optimise the damn thing before buying.  If they sort these issues out, or at least either resolve the varying frame rate, or lock it to 30fps, I will gladly change my review to recommend, as it looks beautiful, even if it runs like a dog dragging it's hole across the carpet, the sound design is excellent and the fluff that I've seen so far is great too.","August 31, 2015","false","6.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

I heavily considered backing it during its Kickstarter campaign due to my love of cyberpunk, but had already contributed money to other projects. The game does a some things right, particularly with its setting, but fails in so many other areas that I cannot recommend it.\n\nI've only played the game for 3 hours and felt like I was fighting the controls the entire time.\n\n- Often I'd place a sniper in a high position only to watch her refuse to take a shot at anyone below once the combat start. Occassionally she would run down an elevator to join the other combatants, getting gunned down the entire way. There's no way she didn't have line of sight to at least one of the army of enemies below her.\n\n- Any time I tried a stealth kill with a silenced weapon, the character would run up to arms length with the target, who would trun around at the approach and initiate a gun fight. Outside of the tutorial these stealth kills never once worked.\n\n- Characters I'd moved around for a wide flank would end up getting flanked themselves by one of the enemies that seem to come from every single direction. Not so much a problem in itself, but while I was focusing on my other two operatives, the two moving around to flank would completely ignore anyone shooting them in the face from 5 ft away unless expressly told to return fire. There is no toggle I know of for characters to automatically return.\n\n- Weapons must be manually drawn, meaning I needed to pull out the weapons for each of my characters if they got into a fire fight. Clicking on enemy would not automatically instruct the characters to pull out their weapons, which made absolutely zero sense.\n\nI could go on, but these represent that major annoyances encountered in just the first few hours. The above, however, does not include the bugs.\n\n- I crashed to desktop every single time I tried to exit to main menu or load within the game.\n\n- Cars in the game could be seen doing sharp donuts in the middle of a high security facility. Cars also seem to pass right until my operatives, who launch over them and back onto the ground as if nothing happened.\n\n- Enemies spawned from alarms return to their doors and run in place agains the door, sometimes stacking up to 3-5 enemies stacked on eachother fruitlessly running into metal for no reason.\n\nSatellite Reign is severely flawed both mechanically and operationally and still feels like an early access/unfinished product. The game desperately needs a pause feature, more information on chances to hit and the benefits of cover, stealth kills that actually work, info on character line of sight, and so much more. This is a tactical game that removes your ability to operate tactically and as such needs a lot of work.","August 30, 2015","false","4.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

Perhaps nostalgia got the better of me with this one.\n\nThe game had me so hyped that it was going to be a worthy followup to Bullfrogs Syndicate. Honestly I dont know how they could be mentioned in the same sentence. This game seems to be more about hacking, than the four cyborgs with massive miniguns tearing up a city I remember from my youth. I just seem to have walk around the map right clicking on ATMs.\n\nPlayed it for an hour and got bored with the clunky controls.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeaSeeOh/recommended/268870/","TeaSeeOh","TeaSeeOh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeaSeeOh/","526 products in account","Currently this game has a ton of positive reviews. However, upon further inspection, a good majority of those reviews are just short statements behind nolstalgia goggles. I did not play the original Syndicate, so I have no attachment to the original game. Though, I do love squad based games, especially if it is in a tactical nature. That being said, does the game deliver? Sadly no. In all honesty, this game only really has one pro and that's the visual aspect.\n\nRight off the bat the thing that'll draw you in first is obviously the world and setting. It's a beautifully crafted cyberpunk city, that's fairly big and open for you to explore and play around in. The lighting is top notch, the signs shine bright with plenty of ambience that makes you appreciate the work put into the small details. Stuff that fades out into the back drop of most games has you zooming in to see the little details, such as MeGaCo Pizza, Noodle Boy, and various other little shops I wouldn't notice otherwise if they weren't detailed to the smallest prop. Of the many complaints you'll find of this game, visually and aesthetically will likely never be mentioned in a negative light.\n\nThe game world itself is fairly large on top of looking gorgeous, and it's all alive. From cars zooming past, to random civilians moving about, and even what appears to be squatters in certain parts of the city are all there to give this locale a heartbeat. The music isn't even all that outstanding or standout, but it at least is appropriate to the setting to even further give things a pulse. However, it being alive doesn't mean it has a personality to match. Nothing is explained in the game world, aside from "evil corporation(s), take them down". And that's basically it when you're thrown into it. Maybe I missed it as well, but was the locale ever really even explained? What city is this? Is it based off any real one? Is it a made up one for the game? Does it even have a NAME? Each section just has a generic label: Downtown, Industrial, Grid, etc.\n\nI can't even say you can ignore this to get immersed into the locale with your own accord. Usually you can overlook this by inserting your own creations into the world. However, there's no character creation whatsoever. When you start the game, you're stuck with just random squadmates that each fill a role: Soldier, Support, Hacker, Infiltrator. What if I wanted two Soldiers, or two Infiltrators? Nope. Stuck with what it gives you. Further you have no control over their names either. I got Jeffrey Yankey, S. Somnambulant, Y. Yoruko, and other mad lib names. The only way of changing up your squad is by a method the game introduces called "Cloning". You basically scan the street for different civilians and "hijack" them to take their attributes and appearance via cloning. So now my group is even more random and even further from my own creation.\n\nSpeaking of cloning, it's quite possibly the most POORLY explained mechanic in any video game I've EVER played. Seriously, it's freaking bad. The tutorial in the dossier is as follows:\n\nCloning\nYour agents clone bodies from civilians.\nAnd that is it. Seriously? It's the equivalent of a combat tutorial ONLY saying "Combat: it's where you kill people."\n\nIn general a good majority of things aren't explained whatsoever in this game. You will get more information in the short description of the game and the setting as a whole from the Steam store page. After the tutorial you're just tossed into the world with no description of what to do aside from your "Mission Control" tab in the menu. Even then all that it really gives you are pings around the map of what to do next. But what end goals are you planning in the scheme of things? Who are you doing it for? What is the overall purpose?\n\nI can't even say the game makes up for it with gameplay. There is no pause, at most being an ability your support has to spec into which slows down time. If you don't know this prior, your fights just end up being akin to playing Scrabble with alphabet soup vomit. It's a mess and just ends up feeling clunky. It isn't even a matter of difficulty, it just feels hectic and basic. Speaking of difficulty, there really is none. The AI is incredibly bad and once outside a facility you just SLAUGHTERED, the "evil corporations" never give chase. In fact even if you end up dying during a mission you undertook, you can simply wait to respawn your fallen comrade AT NO COST at a close enough relay. Is it even possible to get a game over?\n\nAll missions end up being the same as well. Essentially getting inside a facility and out with the goods(intel, prototypes, etc.). To the game's credit, you can honestly tackle this same objective in different facilities numerous different ways. One of them had me using a rooftop with my infiltrator to cover my other agents as they moved about the base, with me later using a zip line to meet up with them. Another instance had me legitimately stealthing around cameras, using my Infiltrator to use her stealth ability to slip past guards....But truth be told, this is all killed by the above mentioned respawn system. What I usually can just end up doing, is frankly just using my 3 teamates as bullet sponges as I rush the objective and then get out. Did anyone die? Oh okay, just respawn over here. It never feels like a satisfying experience to complete a mission, because there's no real risk associated. It would be like an XCOM mission where you can just revive a fallen soldier, vet and all, at the Skyranger if they fall.\n\nAll in all this game is very much a meh experience. It's the case of a game looking pretty, but having nothing going for it in terms of substance.","August 30, 2015","false","4.9"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

But since everyone downvotes it because they don't agree with me I might as well write this: WORST GAEM EVURZ LOL DYE NUBS because the voting system on steam is more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t than this game.\n\nThe game suffers from several flaws that I feel could make the game a lot better:\n1. The enemies have two sets of flashlights, White and Yellow. When Yellow they are looking for you, but haven't found you yet, and White, everything that isn't yellow, all from not knowing about you to outright attacking you (This can be annoying as you never know if they're running towards you to kill you, or running past you.\n2. You can target enemies that your agent cannot attack properly, making them shoot at an impenetrable wall all for nothing. Another thing that is a real bother about your agents and shooting is how, while there is a way to make them move and attack as they meet targets, there are no ways of making them stay in cover, and shoot at any target, you have to micromanage it so incredibly deep.\n3. A lot of the game is based on you having to micromanage everything, from setting up every agent, choosing their targets, using their abilities, and ressurecting fallen agents, all while under fire from multiple locations, having enemies come from all directions and leaving you to either stay where you are (Which mostly ends up killing you) or running up against the enemy in a hail of bullets to get a better position. Neither is very fun to choose.\n4. When in a gun fight you want to get into cover as fast as possible, so if you happen to get your agents not standing in cover, you'll want to mark them all and click on the closest cover, right? well this game punishes you for it because actually clicking for them to get in cover or just standing next to cover is pixel-close, easily making your agents just wander around in a damn ugly dance.\n5. Movement is very forced, your agents don't change direction or turn corners with anything but ugly drunken stagger, whenever they reach a corner they stop for a split second before shambling into the new direction.\n5.1 The movement get's extra terrible when trying to Stealth Kill enemy guards, due to if the guards turn a corner your agent will first run to the place they were when you clicked them (Even if it's out of the way), then they will take the same drunken stagger around the same corner the guard did, and then they go after the guard! (And hope that it didn't turn any more corners as it'll make even more drunken staggering on your side!)\n\nThe game is very unforgiving, there are security cameras everywhere, guards randomly patrolling, something simple like hacking an ATM machine can become a fight where the game throws everything and the kitchen sink at you, and the ATM hacks are giving such small rewards you begin questioning the games intent. You always wish you have 4 hackers and 4 assassins just so you can kill everything without being heard and hack everything because your hacker needs to be in so many places at once.\n\nSo far I can say that if you want a casual game, Don't get it.\nIf you like RPGs where you have soooo much options (you're able to Force some actions, like hacking, to happen, but without the right skills your agents can die to RNG and alert nearby enemies to his location). But you also need to think extremely Strategical as you are constantly surrounded by enemies and have to think fast, even if you've planned greatly. You also need to micromanage the game on an insanely deep level that I've explained earlier in the review.\n\nHOWEVER, the game feels incredibly great when you have managed to get past a certain objective which has given you problems for a while.\n\nBUT, the game seems to punish both Guns Blazing and Stealth styles as stealth is very easy to screw up and requires a lot of work, most of the time by one or two agents leaving the other two to just stand and hope not to get outflanked while you're busy. Likewise the Guns Blazing option gives you a better feeling for loosing, since you're going in blazing! It's to be expected if you screw up, but it's still easy to be outflanked, outnumbered, not having the opportunity to shoot down alarming guards, and you're having to out-micromanage a computer. ♥♥♥♥ that!","August 28, 2015","false","33.2"," 9 of 69 people (13%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","13","9","69","0","0"

The game is solid and it has a good artstyle that nails the cyberpunk genre.  I love the open city gameplay, along with all of the things to do: rob banks, siphon money off ATMs, steal data, break people out of jail, etc.\n\nThe main problem for me is the lack of fun.  That's just my personal tastes, nothing against this game or how it was made.  I prefer a slower paced, almost turn-based approach.  I would LOVE to have a pause option in order to fully control the 4 agents better.\n\nSmall nitpick.  The pathfinding isn't the greatest.

I loved Syndicate Wars. It is one of my favorite games on Playstation. Unfortunately, Satellite Reign is nowhere near as good. This game has potential, but it will not be reached until Satellite Reign II, if that ever comes out.\n\nThe thing I absolutely hated in Satellite Reign is mouse controls. The agents feel unresponsive sometimes, certain actions are very hard to get to activate at maximum camera height. It's also hard to get the agents to stand exactly where you need for the same reasons. Overall, the controls feel laggy and not precise enough.\n\nThis makes the game unplayable at times thanks to the fact that it is real-time. I was struggling to control my agents and get them to do exactly what I wanted them to in fights where more than two enemies were involved. Then there's the fact that the game doesn't save your location or certain game state elements. When you reload a saved game it simply places your agents at the neares respawn location. Basically, you can't try a certain approach and when it doesn't work just reload and try again. You'll have to run back from the damn spawn point, get all agents into positions, wait for the enemies to move into their positions... Basically, the game actively punishes you for reloading and tries to force you to live with the consequences of failed actions.\n\nThis could work for you, but it doesn't for me. I could ignore this if the rest of the game was tight, but it's just not.\n\nEnemies keep respawning almost instantly if you take them out silently, makes clearing compounds stealthily to try and make a path for your Hacker completely pointless. It all boils down to two approaches: sneak past all the security cameras and guards or fight your way to the objective and back. If at least the missions had a bit more variety to them, but most of the missions in the first grid are just the same routine over and over again with nothing to do between them except for trying to get better clones.\n\nUnless you're REALLY into Syndicate and want something to scratch that itch, go ahead and grab Satellite Reign. Otherwise, I don't recommend it.","January 23","false","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When they came out of Early Access I bought the game because I was curious and left me pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe game feels very much Syndicaty to me. You roam around a city doing cyborgy stuff, and there's plenty to do. It can be quite challenging, and you more or less get to set your own pace. In a way SR does some things better than the original that inspired this title; the things you do in the world make a lot more sense and serve you well, and the agent specialization and skill system work really well.\n\nThat said, the game isn't without its flaws. Combat can be frustrating (due to technical issues; responsiveness of agents, pathfinding, enemy spawning, illogical terminal placements, etc), the other side of the coin means that it can be incredibly rewarding when you /do/ manage to complete a mission.\n\n(TLDR) Despit its flaws, it's still a really interesting game that plays unlike anything else that was released in recent years, and well worth the price they're asking (which at this time of writing is below 30 euro).

In it's current state I can't recommend it and can see after a few more hours it'll be shelved and forgotten about. I was really looking forward to this since I backed it on kickstater but it's failed to meet with the hype.\n\nUSER INTERFACE\n1 - you can't alt-tab out to the desktop with out the app forcing its way back to focus\n2 - loading screens are pointless "loading...." then "establishing satellite connection...." it takes so long to load and my rig is able to run this thing on ultra in full HD with no problems\n3 - in the R&D screen, click the plus to add more scientists, the scrollbar always scrolls back to the top, unless you click a different item and click back\n4 - get some glitches with the mouse refusing to leave the bottom 5% of the screen unless I click the mouse buttons\n5 - cannot change to a screen res other than desktop res.\n6 - cannot rotate screen - this is just ludicrous, instead the camera spins round of its own accord. Blowing trying to gather any tactical advantage\n\n\nGAME PLAY\n1 - the AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, it's so easy to pop around a corner and they won't bother looking, they'll often get stuck in places (the pathfinding is terrible - more on that in a moment)\n2 - pathfinding it terrible, agents will often get stuck behind things such as barriers, signs\n3 - number of times agents refus to carry out orders, I click to enter a door, they stand still and get killed; tried clicking and moving away but they refuse to obey - looks like the queing system for commands is flawed\n4 - restarted a game after destroying camers in the military zone, lo-and-behold all the cameras are back - there is no continuity to destroyed objects. Pretty lame for a game these days\n5 - agents will often refuse movement commands and stand around getting killed (very annoying!)\n6 -  random attacks by NPC security staff even though my threat indicator reads 0, and weapons are holstered\n7 - bug in throwing grenades, character will attempt to get in range but usually just approachs the target zone and doesn nothing else\n8 - cannot reliably click the grenade icon above an agent - what normally happens is the target marker appears then vanishes. Pressing "G" is the only reliable method\n9 - its way too easy - pretty much any mission can be done by hijacking a security agent, get him to walk around the base, destroy all cameras then you infiltrate. The death penalty needs to be much greater than a few credits and maybe loss of XP - MAJOR ISSUE that will impact re-playability\n10 - FAR FAR FAR FAR too easy","September 9, 2015","false","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said, the depth of options and customization is surprisingly varied. You can clear things using just stealth or just combat, or go for a hybrid of the two. The number of options for getting from point A to B is also really enjoyable. Gotta make it through a door?

One of my first reviews on steam, so will just to in regular fasion.\n\nPros:\nAmazing atmosphere, good gameplay.\n\nWhat was the last game in recent N years that made you think while not being a puzzle? This can be the one. You have one of two major opportunities for any mission: bash or stealth. Though even forcing will not work for you if you go headon without using some brain. Seen some other review where people were wincing for force like never works, that is completely wrong. Force can get you through with this game, but not singlehandedly.\n\nHeroes: nice look, some RPG system.\n\nStealth: Locations in game have lots of stealth attributes like Cameras/CentryTowers/Gates, but all of these can be negated by hacking/rewiring power generators or security terminals and backdoors of course.\n\nBruteforce: Health/Armr/Shield/Guns as usual. Bonus with environmental terrain. Enemies calling for support. And nice feature of making own army by taking enemies under control.\n\nVideo: Setting is nice hyberpunk style. I can't say it is super-duper scenery, but it is pleasant all around and it has it's nice scenery and vista points to get to. I'd prefer it being a bit less resource intensive and it being more smooth though.\n\nAudio: Nice background fitting the setting with variations for fight/stealth/etc.\n\nGeneral: Has feeling of old-school games, ie Cyndicate and also Neromancer book.\n\n\nCons:\nStealth is pretty much not worth it atm, as brute forcing most of the game is easier and gives more income/benefits.\n\nSome lack of chars management, like seldom auto-path glitches or no auto-fire feature.\n\nOverall:\nHighly recommended. I don't buy much stuff, but this thing is worth it. If you see discount -- higly recommended to aqcuire.","February 13","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's arguably a better Shadowrun game than the Shadowrun games (the only thing it's missing is magic).\n\nAbility/Class balance is all over the place but now that I put some thought into it, each class has its Niche other than the Soldier, who is butts.  The Support does its job pretty well with some strong group-wide passives and Scanning, the Infiltrator is a Ninja Gaiden, and the Hacker will push you through the end-game with Hijack.  The Soldier sits around and is huge I guess?  Is eventually replaced with Augmentations?\n\nStrong visual aesthetics if you like Neon (I do).  Music is kind of bland cyber punk techno stuff.\n\nThe story is fairly bleah.  The writing is decent, though you're likely to miss most of it.  The ending is hilarious (I just got the pun).\n\nMission/Level design is pretty good.  Each area has multiple entry-points and the game really benefits from planning before execution.  Quests are weird as hell, though.  Like you'll break into a warehouse and then find out that you have to do something in another Zone before breaking into the warehouse again because...?\n\nOverall, a good game.","February 16","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I liked it, but it was definitely not as difficult as the Commandos series, and it didn't offer depth in the right places. Still, it was a cool game that I enjoyed playing. Here's some pro's and cons that I experienced!\n\nPro's Commandos style gameplay, offering a tactical strategy game with 4 (sometimes more) distinct and original characters.\nNice cyberpunk design.\nClear directions of what to do and where to go to (this tends to be pretty vague at these kind of games).\nRewarding stealth gameplay.\nMultiple paths to one solution (though sometimes this is cheap - like a door that has a terminal next to it that you can hack to open it, but there's also a machine right on the other side to "hardwire" it, giving almost the same result: the door opens).\nCons I would have liked more diverse situations. I had a character with a sniper rifle that I rarely used, as there were never any truly good spots to use the range to your advantage.\nThe ending was really poor. The same boss came back over and over again. Not to mention the awful music at the end that totally didn't fit the entire ambiance of the game.\nThe story, it's simply not good. Only the highlights in the storyline missions have real voiced dialogue, which isn't all that special to begin with. That's about five times. The story is not captivating, and even though I thought the ending was pretty cool, it didn't make any sense (in the last minute a new female person was introduced with a significant role, that altered ending of the story, but either I missed something or I had no idea who they were talking about).\nOverly complex systems such as the research system and the cloning system. It didn't really add to the gameplay, it just made it unnecessarily complex (I did like the income system tho - that was kind of different than usual!).","February 14","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I haven't played syndicate for many long years, but I couldn't help remembering it while going through this one. The old one was repetitive as hell, and this one did improve somewhat on the recipe by adding some layer of story on top of each mission, but it's still more or less of the same gameplay mechanics throughout, peppered with upgrades and various powerups to spice it up.\n\nFor those who did not play the old Syndicate, this is a real time and squad based action game, where you control 4 agents in a futuristic cyberpunk city, reminescent of the movie "Blade runner" where it's always night time and raining. Each agent has core skills common to every agent, and a few special skills specific to their profile (soldier / hacker / support / infiltrator). You tackle various missions spread all over a big map starting low in equipment and firepower and slowly building it up.\n\nI liked the art, the environment and the music very much, and although the AI was dumb it did not stop me from liking the game. I felt like I was playing the old game again, but having grown older I viewed this game with my 2016 eyes and experience and I think that this game is a worthy successor.\n\n[edit after some checks] actually some of the devs worked on the old syndicate so that explains why the game feels so true to its ancestor.","April 4","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game encourages players to be creative and most situations can be approached in many different ways. Complemented by a wide range of equipment and upgrades, the player has an extensive toolbox to play with and after an introduction to the game's mechanics through a brief tutorial, players are allowed to freely roam the city in any way they see fit. This sense of freedom is great. The work that has been put into immersing players in this strange neon/corporate future does its job well.\n\nSome work is still required in terms of enemy AI, which can be fooled somewhat easily at times, but overall the game can be very unforgiving of mistakes and has a good learning curve. Not once in my playthrough did a mission feel like a 'chore'. Every single bit of content was fleshed out, fun and interesting to play.\n\nDefinitely worth picking up, although I am still hoping for some expanding content.

The game allows you to tackle objectives the way you want.  You can smash your way in or sneak.  I play a combination of the two.   Map design is good that it makes choices on making those objectives enjoyable.  The Art and music are fitting the game.  Nothing seems out of place.  Controls work well.  Leveling and character outfitting is well done and makes sense.\n\nCons-\n\nThe game play has some quirks.  Path finding issues, small problem but noticeable if not careful.  The factions act as enemies and allies at the same time.  If you hijack a person of another faction and bring them in to another factions base they will attack them, but if you alerted a faction and run into another faction will attack you as if they were on the same side. Also rare but noticeable is when your character gets stuck on terrain.\n\nConclusion-\n\nBuy this game.  The issues with the game are not major and will probably get fixed with a patch.  Fun experience for me so far.","September 3, 2015","true","24.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In it's current state I can't recommend it and can see after a few more hours it'll be shelved and forgotten about. I was really looking forward to this since I backed it on kickstater but it's failed to meet with the hype.\n\nUSER INTERFACE\n1 - you can't alt-tab out to the desktop with out the app forcing its way back to focus\n2 - loading screens are pointless "loading...." then "establishing satellite connection...." it takes so long to load and my rig is able to run this thing on ultra in full HD with no problems\n3 - in the R&D screen, click the plus to add more scientists, the scrollbar always scrolls back to the top, unless you click a different item and click back\n4 - get some glitches with the mouse refusing to leave the bottom 5% of the screen unless I click the mouse buttons\n5 - cannot change to a screen res other than desktop res.\n6 - cannot rotate screen - this is just ludicrous, instead the camera spins round of its own accord. Blowing trying to gather any tactical advantage\n\n\nGAME PLAY\n1 - the AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, it's so easy to pop around a corner and they won't bother looking, they'll often get stuck in places (the pathfinding is terrible - more on that in a moment)\n2 - pathfinding it terrible, agents will often get stuck behind things such as barriers, signs\n3 - number of times agents refus to carry out orders, I click to enter a door, they stand still and get killed; tried clicking and moving away but they refuse to obey - looks like the queing system for commands is flawed\n4 - restarted a game after destroying camers in the military zone, lo-and-behold all the cameras are back - there is no continuity to destroyed objects. Pretty lame for a game these days\n5 - agents will often refuse movement commands and stand around getting killed (very annoying!)\n6 -  random attacks by NPC security staff even though my threat indicator reads 0, and weapons are holstered\n7 - bug in throwing grenades, character will attempt to get in range but usually just approachs the target zone and doesn nothing else\n8 - cannot reliably click the grenade icon above an agent - what normally happens is the target marker appears then vanishes. Pressing "G" is the only reliable method\n9 - its way too easy - pretty much any mission can be done by hijacking a security agent, get him to walk around the base, destroy all cameras then you infiltrate. The death penalty needs to be much greater than a few credits and maybe loss of XP - MAJOR ISSUE that will impact re-playability\n10 - FAR FAR FAR FAR too easy","September 9, 2015","false","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I personally feel this game was not worth the money.\nFirst, My computer meets recommended requirements and it is capable of running The Witcher III quite nicely, which I believe is a much more resource hungry game.\n\nThat said... the following bothered me so much that I don't want to play any further than the 5 hours I've put into it (SR) so far.\n\n1. The camera only rotates a few degrees. Many times I've wanted to get a better view and was unable to do so.\n2. The Ziplines seems forced and unneccesary. I find no pleasure in this feature.\n3. The fast travel spoils it for me, but that's a matter of personal taste.\n4. The game takes a long time to load. I've spent what feels like at least five minutes just waiting for progress bars; The satellite connection needs to be established both before and after I load a saved game? I'm not sure what this refers to but I imagine it's the process of loading the scene and all the assets... it takes a while.\nAnd finally, when the game is up and running...\n5. The frame rate is poor and the AI is erratic. I've watched a security guard run up and down the door-door stairway at least ten times for no apparent reason... and sometimes they seem to notice me when I was certain that the coast was clear.\n\nI can appreciate the effort that went into making this games and the visual assets are quite nice to look at...But for the frustrations above, I feel like I've spent more money on this than I would have liked.

The Support does its job pretty well with some strong group-wide passives and Scanning, the Infiltrator is a Ninja Gaiden, and the Hacker will push you through the end-game with Hijack.  The Soldier sits around and is huge I guess?  Is eventually replaced with Augmentations?\n\nStrong visual aesthetics if you like Neon (I do).  Music is kind of bland cyber punk techno stuff.\n\nThe story is fairly bleah.  The writing is decent, though you're likely to miss most of it.  The ending is hilarious (I just got the pun).\n\nMission/Level design is pretty good.  Each area has multiple entry-points and the game really benefits from planning before execution.

This is by far one of the best games I've played lately. I watched a few trailers before and after the game's release, but was mostly just curious about it. I finally picked it up and just after the quick tutorial I was fully invested, if you aren't sure about the game I suggest watching a video of the quick tutorial to make your decision.\n\nThe game has a great art style and graphics are more than I could hope for. The gameplay is fairly simple but leaves a lot up to your own preferred play style. You can break into places guns blazing or carefully sneak in using various abilities and techniques. There is a lot of customization for your character skills and equipment, I can't wait to see what it's like further into the game. I saw a hint of co-op multiplayer on the game's website and look forward to playing it with friends.\n\nThe only downside I have with the game so far is the menu's blur effect, it throws off my vision and I try to view it as quickly as possible. There is a lot of story and interesting details to check out here, so hopefully its something you can change at some point.","January 2","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mryon/recommended/268870/","mryon","Yon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mryon/","318 products in account","It's time to update this review. I originally gave a thumbs down based on the early access version, which was very messy by the time. Now I'm gonna re-review it, based on the final version.\n\nWhat can I say. I can finally say I'm playing the so awaited Syndicate Wars game expected for almost two decades. It isn't simply a nostalgia based game, it took the formula to another level. Syndicate games had an open world feeling way before GTA saw the day of light, despite being mission/level based.\n\n5 Live Studio did a great job here. They inserted many features from different games to evolve the Syndicate formula.\n\nYou can play with 4 unique classes, each one with it's own speciality. Soldier is a close combat unit, as it's perks and skills relies on that. There's the support, as the name says, it's something close to Battlefield's medic. The hacker is the unity dedicated to shut down cameras, security systems, machine guns and open restricted areas doors. They also hack ATMs, allowing you to get more income. They can "mind control" civilans, or even enemies, to join your roster. And, there's the assassin, a mix between TF2's spy and sniper. As the name says, it relies on long-range and stealth skills.\n\nNow there's a stealth system, which allows you to make your objectives without being spotted by the enemy. It's up to you how you want to complete the objectives. You often enter into hostlie territories. Besides the guards, there are surveillance camers and auto guns able to detect you. If you're detected, the enemies sound the alarm and you enter a alert mode similar to Metal Gear Solid games. There're different wanted levels. The more you engage your enemies, more wanted you get. It's like the GTA star level wanted system. It'll lower as long you keep yourself undetected.\n\nUnlike previous Syndicate games, where each mission had a city of it's own, Satellite Reign now has a unique world map, similar to the sandbox open world games. You get access to different parts of the cities as long you progress into it. You can perform many different missions in each part of the city. Also, there's a checkpoint/fast travel system, similar to Skyrim and Far Cry 3/4 in different parts of the city. It's only possible to set your characters equipment on those checkpoints.\n\nA Company of Heroes/XCOM: Enemy Unknown-like cover system is also a new feature. Each cover has different levels of protection and it works both for you as the enemies. A good cover can give you an upper hand even against large numbers of enemy waves.\n\nLike the previous Syndicate games, you can get money and spend it into research. There's a lot of guns, armors and equipments for you to invest. You'll need to recruit researches around the city for your team (bribing them) to join your squad and speed up the researches. You can rob banks and invade factories and enemy bases for money and prototype acquirement. Each prototype allows you to research and mass produce it later.\n\nNow, the cons. Framerate is unstable. There's often framerate drops along the game, specially with many enemies around the screen. Your team's AI sometimes is slow responsive or wacky, this is aparent on cover situations sometimes when you right-click on your enemies to engage them, but they get out of the cover, making them exposed. This can be annoying sometimes. Another issue is that you can't fast travel on the pause screen map, only on the game. C'mon, Skyrim and Far Cry allows you to fast travel on the pause screen, why can't Satellite Reign can't? You can't order your characters through the minimap. This is something basic, on any RTS/Building game, to allow you to give orders to your units on the minimap. A major drawback here, which can be annoying on many situations. You can't also spin your camera, it stucked on the same position for the entire game. Another drawback here and something that was present on Syndicate Wars. Sorry, 5 Live Studio, but you got lazy here.\n\n\nYes, it improved considerably in comparison to the glitch mess it was the early access and I'm enjoying it a lot. There's some issues, as I pointed out above, but nowhere compromising the whole experience. If the devs update it further and implement new features in the future, it'll improve it even further.\n\nSyndicate fans, this is a must buy. Great game!","December 11, 2014","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","10"

I was far, far to young to play Syndicate in its prime, and as a cyberpunk fan it disapoints me that no proper sequel ever came out. All that said, I think Satellite Reign does what I wanted Syndicate to do much better than any actual Syndicate game could be. The gameplay is a mix of real time squad tactics and top down stealth, and both systems are very well built. The games "Levels", really just facilities in a larger world map, are complex mazes of security systems and the potential for infinite enemies, a questionable decision that personally, I feel works well in the context of this game. When alerted, a steady but never ending stream of guards will begin to trickle out of certain buildings, which makes long, drawn out gunfights a non-option. You can not simply kill all the guards in an area. The game forces you to keep moving, remain on your toes or risk getting bogged down in soldiers. This focus on constantly jumping between cover, using abilities and trying to also plan your next move makes for a fast paced and tense game. Also the city is ♥♥♥♥ing pretty.","September 1, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When they came out of Early Access I bought the game because I was curious and left me pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe game feels very much Syndicaty to me. You roam around a city doing cyborgy stuff, and there's plenty to do. It can be quite challenging, and you more or less get to set your own pace. In a way SR does some things better than the original that inspired this title; the things you do in the world make a lot more sense and serve you well, and the agent specialization and skill system work really well.\n\nThat said, the game isn't without its flaws. Combat can be frustrating (due to technical issues; responsiveness of agents, pathfinding, enemy spawning, illogical terminal placements, etc), the other side of the coin means that it can be incredibly rewarding when you /do/ manage to complete a mission.\n\n(TLDR) Despit its flaws, it's still a really interesting game that plays unlike anything else that was released in recent years, and well worth the price they're asking (which at this time of writing is below 30 euro). But if you're someone who gets frustrated easily, you may want to skip this one.","September 6, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Love the idea, some great visual tricks and an excellent soundtrack. It's unlike anything I've ever played but the best analogy would be an xcom in real time.\n\nAnd now for the bad: everything else. The micromanagement is endless and can get very frustrating because your agents will not do ANYTHING by themselves, including returning fire. You even have to select a new target every time you kill one, which also interupts any channeling skills you might be using on the respective agent immediately placing it on cooldown. I can't count the amount of times my agents run out of cover for no apparent reason during the round-robin click-fest of combat and or the amount of times they attempted to shoot through unbreakable walls/barriers instead of moving to a better firing position.\n\nThe levelling system seems completely useless. Everytime you level up or get a new piece of kit, all enemies magically get some kind of equivelant. Just got your first shield? Congratulations! Now every man and his ♥♥♥♥ing Patrol Dog too! Armour? We got that when you first hit level 5! Lasers weapons?! You must be new here...\nThey should have just removed the levelling/equipment aspect and just given you everything from the start because there is absolutely no reward for smashing your face into a wall long enough to level up enough or finding those prototypes deep in enemy territory. Atleast that way you're on the same level instead of playing catch up the whole way through.\n\nThe stealth system is the only option. However when you inevitably fail because of some random patrol or camera you're most likely going to die if you can't run away and hide from the endless amount of obscene enemy forces that spawn. So do what I did and destroy cameras (even though it will alert/ spawn guards) and shut down generators, and stealth kill as many patrols as you can so atleast your deaths aren't meaningless right? Wrong. Cameras respawn, generators turn back on, and patrols respawn incredibly quickly. I once hit the pause button to invest in a new skill only to find when I returned a patrol had respawned from thin air right in front of my face.\n\nThere's challenging and then there's padding combined with punishing you for overcoming that challenge. If you enjoy the latter, then get this game, but I can not recommend a game that I will probably never finish.

It's not a GTA like open world, but feels lived in and atmospheric.\n\nYou break into secure facilities and steal stuff. Method of approach is up to you. Plays a lot like Eidos's Commandos franchise, where you sneak around enemy bases.\n\nThe Agent's skills, the equipment and augmentations make all kinds of playstyles viable and fun. Hijack enemies and create a slave army, sneak in with suppressed weapons or blow up the main gate with Miniguns and grenades - its a very flexible game.\n\nNOTE: AI quirks and inconsistencies can make the experience frustrating, especially for new players.

I really hope that a big DLC expansion comes out and builds on what I think is a really solid game.  Big thumbs up on this one.","March 7","true","85.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is solid and it has a good artstyle that nails the cyberpunk genre.  I love the open city gameplay, along with all of the things to do: rob banks, siphon money off ATMs, steal data, break people out of jail, etc.\n\nThe main problem for me is the lack of fun.  That's just my personal tastes, nothing against this game or how it was made.  I prefer a slower paced, almost turn-based approach.  I would LOVE to have a pause option in order to fully control the 4 agents better.\n\nSmall nitpick.  The pathfinding isn't the greatest.  Several times I had to scroll around the map trying to find an agent who was stuck infinitely running into a wall.","March 6","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Do not let the syndicate from 2012 give you a tainted view on what was once a top notch game series, as these devs had nothing to do with it. Satellite reign is the spiritual successor to syndicate and syndicate wars, bringing new features and combining it with the old. If you have played the older syndicates then you most likely know what youre getting into, however if you havent then keep reading. you play the role of a CEO opperating a hostile takeover of this city after corperate corruption has overdone politics, you remotely control an elite team of 4 cloned operatives to do your bidding, research new tech and expand your secret corperate empire by taking control of the assets of your enemies. using your modified clones you will kill, steal, wreak havoc and coherse your way through an insanely detailed open world from a birds eye point of view. the controls are rather simple and the AI could have been improved a bit more but overall this game does the classics more justice than the shooter reboot in 2012. i do recommend getting it if youre a fan of the classic syndicate or if youre looking for a uniqe strategy/tactical experience.","January 17","true","35.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved Syndicate Wars. It is one of my favorite games on Playstation. Unfortunately, Satellite Reign is nowhere near as good. This game has potential, but it will not be reached until Satellite Reign II, if that ever comes out.\n\nThe thing I absolutely hated in Satellite Reign is mouse controls. The agents feel unresponsive sometimes, certain actions are very hard to get to activate at maximum camera height. It's also hard to get the agents to stand exactly where you need for the same reasons. Overall, the controls feel laggy and not precise enough.\n\nThis makes the game unplayable at times thanks to the fact that it is real-time. I was struggling to control my agents and get them to do exactly what I wanted them to in fights where more than two enemies were involved. Then there's the fact that the game doesn't save your location or certain game state elements. When you reload a saved game it simply places your agents at the neares respawn location. Basically, you can't try a certain approach and when it doesn't work just reload and try again. You'll have to run back from the damn spawn point, get all agents into positions, wait for the enemies to move into their positions... Basically, the game actively punishes you for reloading and tries to force you to live with the consequences of failed actions.\n\nThis could work for you, but it doesn't for me. I could ignore this if the rest of the game was tight, but it's just not.\n\nEnemies keep respawning almost instantly if you take them out silently, makes clearing compounds stealthily to try and make a path for your Hacker completely pointless. It all boils down to two approaches: sneak past all the security cameras and guards or fight your way to the objective and back. If at least the missions had a bit more variety to them, but most of the missions in the first grid are just the same routine over and over again with nothing to do between them except for trying to get better clones.\n\nUnless you're REALLY into Syndicate and want something to scratch that itch, go ahead and grab Satellite Reign. Otherwise, I don't recommend it.","January 23","false","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Always loved Syndicate, but Sydicate Wars was a dissapointment.  This is what I dreamed of.\n\nI recommend enabling the pause/stim feature. Makes things much more enjoyable (the opinion of someone who loves turne-based).  I don't puse too much, but when things get sticky and you need to melee one unit while you hack into the mind of another and the other two clones take out the remainders. Silly fun, and I didn't realize you could hijack more than one unit, not till almost the end!!  Whoops.  I did encounter a few bugs, but no show stoppers. Didn't even use more than one manual save and the smart auto-saving process.\n\nAgain, there was some time invested before I could appreciate this game, and by that time the levels were getting more and more clever. Cutting the power to doors then hacking them to open them, put them in limbo.  But, cut the power back on and the door slip open.  Or stall them open by cutting the power right when a character walks through.\n\nReminder to self: This is a review, not a tip sheet.\n\nIn closing: This was $10 and time well spent. I have always been waiting Syndicate to end properly...  and now I feel like I can let go now.  5 Lives Studios, you did a great job developing on an already great idea.

Some of the AI seems a bit dated, but it fits with the theme of the world. I'll exploit the AI to try to attack an objective multiple ways. It's still easy to get yourself killed if you don't get used to running early on, as you get more powerful then it's less of a concern. The world is setup so you can attempt an objective multiple ways, whether by stealth with one or more people, by force, by drones or hijaked people. There's several ways to get into areas as well, ziplines (you can attempt it even without gear and face falling off the line and right in front of guards), air vents, hacking, messing with hardware, hijaking guards who have keycards, to just blowing a hole through the main gate. Distractions can be beneficial. You have four character types: assault (explosions & bullet-sponge), support (group buffer & healer), hacker (hijaking & hacking), and infiltrator (assassination, stealing, & athletic feats).\n\nA lot of features you don't realize are in the game unless you fumble into them, like double clicking character portraits to get from one person to the next when they're strewn across the map. The characters ability activation buttons are tiny, so it plays better if you just use the keyboard, especially since everything is realtime. Sometimes cover is wonky and aguard that should be able to see you when you're behind full cover runs up and starts bashing or trying to arrest you, and sounding the alarm. Sometimes while in scan mode guards will be mostly invisible, in a glitchy sorta way. Loading the game up has an attrotious load time, usually multiple minutes, luckily thats the only time it'll happen in the game.\n\nI enjoy exploring the open world and hijaking the choice suspects and bribing scientists. I especially enjoy hijaking drones and guards/police and making them run amok through the town or on missions, it's a frequent distraction method I use. I like going the slow plodding way in missions, taking what I want and assassinating guards to make my route clear for exfil. I like the graphics and am surpirsed that they used that level of graphics for the tiniest things. This game has room for improvement, but it's been a bit of a guilty pleasure game for me.\n\nIf you enjoy the cyberpunk theme, syndicate, multiple ways to accomplish goals, or RPG's you might just like this game.

This can be the one. You have one of two major opportunities for any mission: bash or stealth. Though even forcing will not work for you if you go headon without using some brain. Seen some other review where people were wincing for force like never works, that is completely wrong. Force can get you through with this game, but not singlehandedly.\n\nHeroes: nice look, some RPG system.\n\nStealth: Locations in game have lots of stealth attributes like Cameras/CentryTowers/Gates, but all of these can be negated by hacking/rewiring power generators or security terminals and backdoors of course.\n\nBruteforce: Health/Armr/Shield/Guns as usual. Bonus with environmental terrain. Enemies calling for support. And nice feature of making own army by taking enemies under control.\n\nVideo: Setting is nice hyberpunk style. I can't say it is super-duper scenery, but it is pleasant all around and it has it's nice scenery and vista points to get to. I'd prefer it being a bit less resource intensive and it being more smooth though.\n\nAudio: Nice background fitting the setting with variations for fight/stealth/etc.\n\nGeneral: Has feeling of old-school games, ie Cyndicate and also Neromancer book.\n\n\nCons:\nStealth is pretty much not worth it atm, as brute forcing most of the game is easier and gives more income/benefits.\n\nSome lack of chars management, like seldom auto-path glitches or no auto-fire feature.\n\nOverall:\nHighly recommended. I don't buy much stuff, but this thing is worth it. If you see discount -- higly recommended to aqcuire.","February 13","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The police are omnipresent, but if you get caught by them, they're just as likely to beat you and rob you as they are to arrest you. Everything you see is connected to a network which can be exploited to breach all sorts of security. Civilians are everywhere, but they don't really do anything other than walk around aimlessly and have no real purpose.\n\nOh...oh THE GAME! The game, right.

What isn't asked though, is if that is a very good idea. I remember the Syndicate games feeling old only a few years after their release. The combat controls just weren't precise enough and the environments and missions felt samey.\n\nReign's story, limited though it is, makes more sense than Syndicates, one long night of bringing down a corporation. It too suffers from average controls, lacking in finese to get your agents to do what you want. In stealth and hacking, the game succeeds. That is why I recommend this game. It's satisfying and very well made, but the game they were emulating perhaps wasn't the best idea.

A lot of the play is along those lines, except in a persistent, semi-open world environment. And that's a good thing! It takes that old atmosphere and modernizes it very well, while adding in a somewhat more freeform gameplay style. The ability to affect the environment (cameras, doors, etc) definitely adds a lot of interesting possibilities to a given run.\n\nSo if pointy-clicky strategy games or strong cyberpunk environments are your jam, I recommend it.\n\nThat's not to say it's perfect. I'd definitely have to say that it gets repetetive after a while. I also wish the story was much more fleshed out. There's a lot of potential for storytelling here, but even with the included novella it seems somewhat thin. And as a consequence of that, now and then I found myself getting into that mentality of "wait, why am I doing this mission again? Does this one matter or is it just for resources?"\n\nStill, I definitely enjoy it.

I enjoyed the cyber-noire story and it was worth finding all the terminals to make sure that all of the narative was revealed (I did use some maps I found online for this, as well as the Steam achievemnents list so that I would know when I found all the terminals in a given zone).\n\nThere are lots of valid aproaches to playing.  You can go loud and shoot everything up, or use brain-jacked agents to open all the doors as you speed-run through, or take your time and stealth everything.
