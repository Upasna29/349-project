You can think in Space Invaders Extreme going to bed with Donkey Kong\nHorizon Shift is one of the most brilliant single screen shmups ever created, that it’s heavily influenced by Taito contemporary classics like Space Invaders Extreme. But it also succeeds on putting a lot of masterful new design ideas on the table, trying to break the player’s preconceptions regarding the genre in disruptive and fully original ways.\n\nIts main gimmick, the possibility of switching between two differentiated action spaces that sometimes get mixed with bullets crossing the horizon line, it’s on a par in its ingenuity with Ikaruga and its polarity design. And the double jump button becomes a joyful mechanic that adds a rare sense of accomplishment, while the player is dodging bullets, destroying ships and trying to jump over moving spikes and other obstacles invading the horizon line. This wise sum of design elements make of Horizon Shift a rara avis, in his combination of shooting and plattforming elements in a cohesive way. You can think in Space Invaders going to bed with Donkey Kong.\n\nBut where Horizon Shift truly shines is in its scoring system, that highly rewards the risks taken by the player. And as life itself, an error can give you a better opportunity for improvement and to scoring high. In Horizon Shift, every single mistake, every ship that invades or destroy a fragment of your horizon, it will increase your scoring multiplier. So the best strategy to scoring high is play in a schizophrenic and bipolar way, missing enemies intentionally, let them invading you horizon, an then use this mistakes to destroy the rest of ships with a higher score bonus. But as life itself, a sum of errors can become your perdition. With every single mistake, the scoring opportunities are higher, but it’s much harder to dodge and jump between bullets and the invading enemies or broken parts in your horizon. Horizon Shift laughs in the face of all the traditional and conservative STG’s players that will try to destroy every single ship, forcing them to radically change his misconceptions regarding the genre. Horizon Shift it’s a Dogma 95 shmup directed by Lars Von Trier.\n\nAnd do you remember the Charles Mingus jazz song “Oh Lord, don’t let them drop that Atomic Bomb on me”? Since the time of the first Raiden, the STG’s players have been trained in not to use the bomb in shooting games if they want to score high. Horizon Shift, like Battle Garegga before it, laughs one more time in the face of this conservative players. In Horizon Shift the bomb not only destroy all enemies and rebuilds your horizon line. Also serves to bank your chain score. So if you don’t drop the atomic bomb on them, Oh Lord!, you will lose all your hard earned multiplier points. Horizon Shift forces you to create a right strategy, using the bomb in the most hard parts, and ensuring that you can survey the next waves until the bomb meter  is fully recharged.\n\nAll of these mechanics and its perfect tuned score system are accompanied by a brilliant level design. The game never becomes boring, and it has a design philosophy inspired by Nintendo classics. With new elements, obstacles, enemies and patterns that appears at a slow but constant pace. The new obstacles always appears in individual levels that serves as tutorial. It explodes every single mechanic in a lot of creative ways and original situations. And the difficulty curve is sublime in its balance.\n\nWith a lot of brilliant design ideas and absorbing visuals that resembles Tetsuya Mizoguchi, Namco or Taito contemporary creations, Horizon Shift has become with Pacman Championship Edition DX+ one of my favorite arcade experiences in Steam.\n\n\n( The writer of this review is not an English native.

They are very active and interested in community input - this cannot be valued highly enough.\n\nWith that being said, unfortunately I don't see the magic that everyone else sees with Horizon Shift. I have tried several times to get into it, and all I can see is a subpar arcade shooter. While the axis-flipping mechanic is not new, the game does bring some interesting platforming mechanics into play complete with enemies being able to destroy the line creating jumpable gaps. On the negative side, the visuals are nothing special. I played with a keyboard and also a controller, and both felt decidedly awkward for what is a simple game although I only tried one of several configurations for the controller.\n\nPros:\n+Its cheap\n+It can run on a toaster\n\nCons:\n-While there are some interesting platforming elements that are new, it wasn't enough to keep me interested.\n-Artwork is bland.\n-Music is generic.\n\nPerhaps I did not get far enough to see something great, but I doubt it.

I will do my best not to let that cloud my review.\nThis game is a very interesting marriage of features from old school arcade games, mostly shoot em ups.\nThe visuals seem to be inspired by asteroids, while the game play is inspired by numerous other games, from some rail games like space invaders to some elements of bullet hell games, to reflexive game play and decision making that seems to be unique to this game, or at least, rare enough for me to not have encountered it before.\nThe rail in this game being in the middle of the screen rather than on one side like the left or bottom, is something that has been used in the past but not nearly as successfully as it is here. The placement of the rail not only gives the game more depth but also creates room for some very interesting interactions and stunts; both making it more difficult and more enjoyable than it would have been otherwise.\n\nThe game's simple visuals and unique game play are tied in together seamlessly with silky responses and a perfect soundtrack (note that the silkiness is gone from the game when you are in a bonus level, it will be hard to 100% one of those). Your little ship responds to you perfectly, and for this game that is essential. It really is all about game play, there are no frills, just clean honest game play. At no point while playing the game have I come across game breaking add on or boosts either, something that exists in many arcade games and very much saps any interest in the game once acquired.\nThere is a number of different modes to play the game in, classic, arcade, survival etc. so the users have several choices on how to tackle the game, and they are mostly unlocked after playing the game only once on the starting mode, so I didn't have to torture myself to try them all out. The learning curve for the game was mountainous but the levels and bosses were not unreasonable, I would get owned by a level or a boss, restart, and from my previous play have learned how to deal with it, and later get owned by something else down the line and repeat - I got owned a lot...\n\nNow, I myself am not particularly good with arcade games, so maybe my assessment of the game's difficulty here is not entirely accurate; but I found the game extremely challenging. Very rewarding once you get past a hurdle, but I feel justified in underlining that word back there.\n\nI looked at some of the other reviews on this game, and my experience of the dev's work on other games was as gaucho marx's experience with his fixes here, there was genuine interest in player feedback. That is always appreciated by the community.\n\nSo again, I would like to remind everyone that I was gifted this game before I end my review\n\nPros:  - Easy to pick up, learn the basics\n- Responsive controls\n- Excellent soundtrack\n- Smooth overall game experience\n- Great Support\n\nCons: - Hard to master\n- Might make you cry\n\nAltogether, if arcade games are your thing, you will love this game, and if they aren't you should still give this game a go, it might just change your mind","June 25, 2015","true","3.6"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","5"

You also have to protect the line that you're traveling on, as some enemies can break parts of the line, forcing you to jump over the gaps (though the line is repaired after each wave). The challenge definitely ramps up in later waves, but I've handled bullet-hell games like Crimzon Clover and DonPachi, so bring it on. The soundtrack's pretty decent, too (you can also but the soundtrack for a few bucks more). If you're looking for a fun throwback to shooters in the vein of Space Invaders or Galaga, or if you're looking for a shooter that mixes up the formula a little bit, this is a pretty good game, especially considering the price.","June 2, 2015","true","3.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Well look no further than Horizon Shift.\n\nSpecial Edition Review: Horizon Shift [Real Review Below]\nI tried.. I tried so hard, tears were welling down my face when as I tried the same stage over and over and over again each time the end doesn't look any closer than it does when I first started. Me, someone who dares calls himself a great reviewer yet got defeated by a mere arcade game! Someone who proudly claims to finish Touhou 6 on lunatic mode! [I never did, shut up Remilia was hard.] Anyways, enough ranting and crying and forgive me dev for failing to conquer your mountain of a game.\n\nGame was reviewed with a key provided by the developer~\n\nGame Info Name: Horizon Shift\nDeveloper: Flump Studios\nGenre: Arcade Game pure and simple no beating around the bush with this one.\nPersonal Verdict: This game... made me cry.\n\nWhat is Horizon Shift?\nHorizon Shift is an innovative arcade game that  combines elements of shoot em up, arcadey action and the brutality of the shoot em up genre. Now normally in this case we ended up with a hard version of games like meteor, galaga etc etc but like most arcade games from the new to the old Horizon Shift introduces elements that differ it from the competition, namely the Horizon element.\n\nGraphic\nThis game reminds me of asteroid, well chatting with the dev the whole graphic side is inspired by asteroid so that means it plays out wholly in wireframe style graphics art of yer olden days games. That said the background is pretty well done in my book and helps mesh it along with the music as you can see why later.\n\nMusic\nThe music is awesomely psychedelic, which is to say it will serve to pump you up and make you drown in its varied synth like tune. Combine this with the trippy background and by the end of my numerous defeat I was feeling trippy as heck.\n\nGameplay\nMake no mistake. This game is hard. Very very hard. Paul if you are reading this know the fact that I hate you very much.\n\nOn to the gameplay, so what makes Horizon Shift so unique? Well to start with lets talk about what it is not unique in. Its an arcadey game, you press z to shoot, x to jump and c to bomb like most games. Enemies are plenty and comes in a lot of variety and powerups, score, suddenly paid homage minigame appearing are all the standard stuff it does.\n\nWhat it does bring to the table however is the Horizon mechanic. Your shiplike object resides in a line right in the middle of the screen and this line is not invincible. Some enemies will destroy your Horizon piece by piece if they come in contact with it and others will downright obliterate it resulting in an instant KO since the Horizon is the only solid platform for you to stand on. Let say that only part of the Horizon is destroyed you can still survive the stage by jumping over the gaps, a rather risky move seeing as the later levels are choke full of enemies and stage hazard.\n\nIn any case, enemies come from bottom and top side and barring one particular power up you can't really shoot up and down at the same time so you have to switch sides all the time to counter them.\n\nEnemies come in many flavour, the one I dubbed invader simply because they ride on your Horizon and move along it killing you if you come in contact with them, swarmer who targets your Horizon and destroy it, shooter who spits out balls of death at you but are easily avoided for most parts, its the combination of invader and swarmer that usually ends your life.\n\nIf you somehow in an impossible way manages to finish the game, more modes are unlocked for you! So you can continue dying and earning score on the leaderboard.\n\nHappy to say the game controls well, sure it is a bit hard to jump because sometimes you overshoots the gap but hey, it works and no misspressed ever occur to me.\n\nConclusion\nHorizon Shift, a pretty fun arcade shoot em up with unique mechanic, should you get this game? Depends, if you like this sort of games then go for it. The game is not bad at all and the only con I could muster is my inability to get good at this game. Overall Enjoyable.\n\nScoring Methology [Courtesy of Meat King]:\n-	S-Rank: excellent\n-	A-Rank: very good\n-	B-Rank: solid\n-	C-Rank: satisfactory\n-	D-Rank: inferior\n\nVerdict: A-Rank.\n\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

The added mechanics add a bit of depth to the gameplay that I haven't seen in the genre, and it adds elements of platforming that makes strategic defense of your Horizon (the middle line of the screen that you move upon) rather important, due to it being able to be destroyed. Uniqueness in Enemy and variation of enemies add to this in particular with the combinations that can be created, where you have to make quick decisions on taking out one enemy rather then the other, and making a wrong choice can lead to problems for you very quickly. While it's a wave based shooter that I'd love to see more of a “random” mode from for variation over a period of time, for 5 bucks and the experience it gives, you more then get the return on investment in several ways.\n\n+:\nUnique premise works incredibly. The horizon adds a layer of defense that wasn't present before and adds segments of risk that have to be challenged.\n5 Bucks is a good bang for buck for what you get out of the game.\nVariety of enemies and what they do add a bit of different challenges into the mix, especially those that mess with your Horizon.\nA good amount of modes, despite working with the same base ideas and stats to modify.\nPlatforming elements adds a layer of depth to the game that can save you critically at times you aren't able to protect your Horizon.\nSome interesting powerups with the reflection powerup that does change things up in terms of how you look at the battle field.\nOptions, Options, and More Options.-:\nDon't play on anything other then High for the graphics settings, because it doesn't look visually impressive otherwise.\nWould love to see take a more random mode added for variety over the long haul.\nWould like another powerup or two over the long haul.\nFor some gameplay footage and information for the dev: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWUpli5xJDI","May 29, 2015","true","4.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XmiseryX/recommended/326120/","XmiseryX","Misery","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XmiseryX/","382 products in account","You know, for a genre that's supposed to be "dead" according to some, there sure are alot of shmups these days.  I can think of tons of great ones on the PC, shmups of all types, from traditional to bullet-hell and otherwise, and then there's the mobile scene... who coulda known that it would turn out to be totally perfect for that genre?  Well, with a tablet anyway.  Even hyper-difficult bullet-hell games tend to be great on there.   But really, there's tons of them now and more keep coming.  Those saying it's dead need to actually LOOK before talking...  I've played so many of them to freaking death over the years, more than enough to know alot about the genre.\n\nAnd the thing about this is that there are many of these, so many, but few of them are actually unique.  They might have somewhat unique or interesting scoring systems, but for the most part, they follow a certain set of traditional mechanics at their core.  I recognize 4 types of shmups: vertical, horizontal, horizon (not to be confused with this game, this is something totally different), and single-screen, and all four of these subgenres do this.  Now, that's not bad in and of itself, but still, unique games are rare.\n\nThis time though I can say that we have one that actually manages to be unique.  Horizon shift is a single-screen type, like many old arcade games.  No long scrolling levels, or scrolling of any sort.  Any given stage is entirely confined to one screen.  And you shoot things, and those things that are shot will explode.  This though, is where the similarities end.\n\nThis game does 3 seperate things that make it very unique.  Number one is the "horizon" for which it is named. This is a line that horizontally crosses the center of the screen (usually).  Your ship travels back and forth along this line.  Like many single-screen games, you move just horizontally, you cannot just go anywhere on the screen.  But what this also does is let you "flip" from one side to the other, so instead of facing upwards, you are facing downwards, and enemies can approach from either side.  So right there, you've got two things to be watching, and have to deal with this additional movement mechanic.   And this mechanic is important and central to... everything.  If you dont learn it, you will lose very fast.   Also enhancing the movement is the fact that you can jump (and double jump).  This too is another integral part of the game, and combining these two things makes up a huge portion of the challenge.\n\nNumber two is effects that can happen to the horizon itself.  Enemies in this game are color-coded... different colors do different things.  Blue enemies, if they come into contact with the horizon, will break off a section of it that they touch, leaving a gap.  Now, as falling to your doom is an amazingly stupid and embarrassing way to die in any shmup (really, who falls off a cliff in a shmup?), you really want to not fall through these.  The red ones do not destroy the horizon, but instead will cling to it in various ways.  Remember the super irritating bow-tie things from Tempest, way back when?  Yeah.  They're like THOSE.  Except nowhere near as bloody irritating.  You cannot attack them once they're attached, so you have to jump over them as they move around.  Green enemies just shoot at you, their bullets usually popping harmlessly if they hit the horizon.  And then there's the "solid" ones;  if these guys hit the horizon, well, it's like the ships in Space Invaders hitting the bottom of the screen: you're just plain dead.\n\nNumber three though is just how the scoring system works.  You have a "chain" counter that goes up as you destroy enemies.  This just keeps going up, until you spend it by using a bomb (which is charged over time, also by popping enemies).  But the unique part of this is the multiplier.  When a blue or red enemy makes contact with the horizon, your multiplier increases by one.  This is a risk-reward system... if you want high scores, you have to let some of these guys impact the horizon, adding greatly to the danger that you're in.  Waves in the game are fairly short, and the horizon is cleared and fixed between each one, but they're also pretty frantic, so this can build up and kill you pretty fast.  You have to know when to let something connect (and thus when to not shoot at it), and when to make sure it doesnt.  The multiplier resets between waves.  So when you combine all of this, with the movement and such... you've got alot of depth here, and it's quite well balanced.   In addition, every enemy type is unique in it's movement and attack patterns, so you need to keep that in mind too.  And to get the best scores, you need to keep that chain counter going as high as you can before finally firing off the screen clearing bomb.  If you die, you lose the chain and the bomb charge.\n\nIn addition to these things, there are bosses that appear every few waves, a variety of powerups to grab, and Arkanoid style bonus stages where you can earn some big points.\n\nThe game also features many different modes, and numerous options available to you, including screen effects such as scanlines or the "inverted" one that blazes with the force of a thousand stars.  The overall look of the game is a graphics style that's been pretty popular in recent years, sorta similar to that of Geometry Wars and many others, though without the violent flashiness of that game (so you can, you know, actually see what's happening).  The soundtrack is pretty nice too, by the way.\n\nI dont know how long the main game mode is just yet, particularly because my controller keeps randomly disconnecting due to micro USB cables being cheap little snots. I could do with a pair of scissors right now, really.   But I suspect that there are a fairly large number of waves to go through.\n\nSo yes, it's safe to say that I can recommend this one.  It really is a shame to see that the game got buried by Steam's godawful store interface (surprise!), due to it usually wanting to only show "popular" releases (how the heck is this even determined?) so alot of players that might be interested in such a thing wont even notice it, because the blasted thing isnt even SHOWING it.   I think it deserves alot more attention than it's getting.\n\nI say, if you like shmups of any sort, give this one a go.  For $5, you're getting quite a lot here, as this is one of those games that'll take many, many hours to get good at, and there's plenty of depth to it.   Highly recommended.","June 7, 2015","true","1.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","1"

From Galagon (a 90s shareware Galaga clone) to Kenta Cho's classics, like Torus Trooper and Titanion, and through to Jeff Minter's near-perfect Space Giraffe. Played some of Steam's smaller shmups, too, like Revolution Ace and Syder Arcade--and even Flump Studios' last game, the underrated Super Killer Hornet: Resurrection.\n\nHorizon Shift is up there with the best. It's like a long-lost Kenta Cho masterpiece with a dash of Space Invaders Extreme. The central horizon-flipping mechanic is just ingenious--why hasn't one of the shmup giants done this already? Playing essentially two games at once is intense, and it ensures that the excitement never tapers. It also makes for a very difficult ride. I don't think Horizon Shift is a controller-smasher by any means, but it definitely draws from an earlier period of shmup design. A lucky run landed me just barely in the top 20 before this review, and not many people are even playing the game yet. If you're new to shmups, you might get destroyed. But, whatever happens, don't get discouraged--the game steadily and invisibly grows your abilities. You can replay stages that once gave you fits and discover that they're a breeze.\n\nSubtle stuff like that is what makes Horizon Shift work. Flump hasn't fallen into the amateur's trap of letting one cool feature carry an otherwise middling game. Your ship's speed, bullet spread and damage are perfectly tweaked. Every enemy has a clear, unique design and attack pattern, and the bosses are always fair. Bombs are better balanced than in most shmups I've played. Not to mention the brilliance of letting enemies break the horizon platform--and of letting you double-jump. The subtle excellence continues in Horizon Shift's audiovisuals, which are minimalistic but not bland, and attractive but not (in Geometry Wars fashion) overindulgent. A perfect balance that certain people might not catch at first.\n\nThe bottom line? Horizon Shift is one of the essential shmups on Steam, up there with Ikaruga and Space Giraffe. It's also $5. Buy it. Even if you're not a fan of the genre, this game might convert you.\n\nA final word: a bug with this game (now fixed) prevented me from playing it for several weeks. During that time, the developer was more hands-on than I've ever seen. He added me as a Steam friend. We chatted about the problem, tested various builds and finally solved it--and he updated the game soon after. Throughout the process, he was apologetic and beyond gracious. Indie games need less aloof, defensive jerks and more developers like Flump Studios. Start the ball rolling by buying this game.","June 18, 2015","true","14.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

This is the gaming version of that.\nHorizon Shift is a very difficult game to say the freaking least.  Albeit I suck at these types of games. First the fluff. The music is up to par with beats and songs that get your heart pumping and get you into a rhythm.  Graphically the game is suited to what is needed. It doesn't distract your eyes or draw unwanted attention away from whats important. Staying alive. There is a fair amount of different game modes, options and ways to tweak the difficulty. Making it even more harder by jacking up the game speed.\n\nNow the meat of the game is a balance between what you can manage and how ballsy you're feeling. The game rewards you for making it harder on yourself. The little white line holding the level together can be destroyed, damaged, invaded. The only way to rack up a huge score multipliers is to purposefully makes things hard. What this ends becoming is a platforming challenge mixed with a shoot 'em up game. As you jump over the holes the enemy has created. To boot there is also a top/bottom side with enemies coming from both sides. Oh and bosses! Now there is things to help you. Power ups and the bomb but that only comes occasionally. Prepare to die and probably rage quit a few times.

You can collect powerups, sheilds and if you kill enough enemies, you get a "wipe the board" abilitiy which is a life saver at times.\n\nThe graphics and art style is that of an arcade game, and a style that I very much enjoy, you can also add different effects to the visual aspect such as an inverse effect to give your game a different feel.  The game is hard as nails, I have only managed to get a score of about 5500 so far, and that took a lot of concentration and effort, with a lot of rage quits. The game is surprisingly addictive; you will keep coming back for more as you just have to get past that one wave that keeps destroying you.\n\nThe only technical issue I had was the loading times. I was surprised to find that I had to wait at least 20 seconds for the game "load" from launching, and about 10 seconds each time you start a game.\n\nI can recommend Horizon Shift as it is something different - it will keep you coming back for more, it's like a hot but horrible girlfriend, you know you shouldn’t keep going back to it, but the rewards are awesome.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

If you fall into this\ncategoy you can stop reading now and just go buy the game, seriously it's\npretty awesome and very addicting. After finding my bairings, I couldn't put\nthe thing down and found myself lost in a world of bright lights, booming club\nmusic, and never ending frustration. Not the bad kind though, it was the\nfrustration of being so close to completing my next goal only to misstep,\ncausing my run to end just shy of my mark. Horizon shift has the characteristics\nto make you grit your teeth in anticipation while propetually smiling the\nentire time. The controls work great, the game runs smoothly, and as far as I\nnoticed nothing seemed to be broken. If I had to state any issues, it would be\nthe lack of multiplayer, and that once you play tournament mode, everything else\nfails to be as entertaining. I would have liked to see something done for a co-op\nor vs mode in some form, but sadly thats not here in any way. As for tournament\nmode it's pretty easy to see just by watching what I mean. If the game had a more\nrandom format rather than set wave types this might not be as big of an issue.\nRegardless tournament mode is so break neck fast, and full of action that if\nanything other than a pattern system existed, I feel it would be too dificult to\ntake seriously. Even the occaisional random meteor shower tends to be a bit much\nat times.\n\nOverall I'm giving Horizon Shift a B+. It does a fantastic job of differentiating\nitself from all the other shoot em ups and bullet hells. And it's also very fun\nand addicting. But it falls a bit short in that it lacks what seems like a great\nopportunity for multiplayer, and it also becomes a bit stale in the modes other\nthan tournament mode once you give that a go. Even with that though I feel\ntournament mode is enough to keep players coming back to try and top the scoreboards.\n\nGreat game, I highly reccomend picking it up! -8/10","May 29, 2015","true","4.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Then there's the traditional enemy that will just shoot you. It's extremely easy to get caught up by a certain enemy, & while you shoot it, maybe a crab lands on your horizon, no problem right?

Heeeeey, this looks like a Ping Pong Table. Wait, what's with the asteroids, why am I being shot at?!?!...\nIt all starts so gently, you get placed on the centerline of what looks like a giant ping pong table that has had its' net removed. The game has a distinctly neon feel to it, with lots of wireframe overlaid over a 3D background and a thumping dance track that settles you in, you are told that the right thumbstick will flip you so you can either shoot up, or down (Geddit, the ship goes both ways... *ba-dum-tsh* ... I'll get my coat - ... and your P45 - Ed).\n\nAn asteroid here, and an asteroid there and before you know it it's all gone a bit Pete Tong...\nInitially a few blue wireframe asteroids come sailing from both directions, you hammer them with your dinky ship and it's lovely shooty bangs... and then the game turns the screws. Before you know it you're dealing with lasers cutting off sections of the playfield, rocks smashing off pieces of the centerline (meaning that if you navigate off of it, you're going to die horribly, you have a jump button for this purpose), and bullets that either cannot or CAN penetrate the centerline and thus mean that sometimes you can take cover, and sometimes you can't.\n\n... and it was all going so nicely.\n\nA simple enough premise, until everything goes to pot... noodle...\nIf it were -just- a case of shooting up or down, this would be straightforward enough and a reasonable game, but it goes far, far beyond that. The playfield will shift, changing the rules of the game with death beams which cut the field up into little pieces, side based turrets that plop doomspikes onto the centerline that you must either dodge or hop over. This game rapidly evolves past "Nice" and well into the realms of bullet hell, plus platform hell to boot. It's evil, but it's also brilliant at the same time.\n\nUN-TSS UN-TSS UN-TSS UN-TSS...\nThen layered on top of that is an appropriately excellent house/EDM set of tracks that easily warrant the purchase of the OST on top. They're designed to grow and change as you work through the waves, and do so beautifully, and they have real *punch*, which helps with the whole dancing arcade machine thing as you frantically hammer your way through the ever clustering waves of chaos and mayhem around the edges of your horizon centerline.\n\nA little slice of arcade excellence\nAt the price point asked, and for what the game gives in return, you'd be -absolutely mad- not to take this one into your collection, especially if you're a fan of score attacks and arcade games in the vein of Beat Hazard Ultra, or Intake.\n\nVerdict : Highly Recommended, if you buy it, the OST is essential","May 30, 2015","true","1.0"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","14","26","3","3"

I'm rating this as is, no bias.\n\nI first met Paul when I left a nasty review on another one of his games, Super Killer Hornet Resurection.  He friended me and asked what I did and didn't like.  I told him about the glitches and just the little things I flat out didn't like.  He didn't write me off, or say "that's not what everyone else thinks so I don't care".  He took my words, and asked for a sort-of playtest/review of some of his other games.  He gave me a key for Pester on Desura.  It was decent, but it could have been better.  Not gonna lie; I did like it better than SKHR.  I offered him ideas and suggestions on how to improve the feel of it and some mechanics.  Little did I know, he was listening, and he threw in a huge twist.  (note, I also tested Pressure.  I told him it didn't feel fair reviewing it since I didn't like the type of game to begin with.  If you don't like a genre, it takes a lot to change your mind.)\n\nIt started with the idea to make a Pester II.  Just a few mechanic and graphical enhancements; make the game play a little better and look a little better.  He sends me a key for this (again, no bias, just stating a fact.)  I thought at first that this was just a little side project he's been working on.  I downloaded and started the game.  I realized, he actually used a few of my suggestions for Pester on this.  However, I got thrown off when I realized it was platformer influenced.  I'm like, "How the actual ♥♥♥♥ can you combine a Danmaku (the actual name for bullethell/SHMUP) and a platformer?  That doesn't even make sense!"  Well, it plays good.  It's just that simple.  It actually plays good.  He took two genres that generally have NOTHING to do with each other, made them equal, and somehow made it work.  That alone I give him props for.\n\nIt's like a weird space invaders meets... I don't even know.  Mario?  Like, I'm actually almost in shock.  Anyways, it has a decent soundtrack, and is a fun arcade game that you may not play for hours on end, but will come back to eventually and inevitably.  I plan on coming back to it myself.  But the only way you would understand is to try it for yourself.\n\nCongrats, Paul.  I think this one may make it.\n\nP.S., We should definitely discuss the possibility of a Pester II for Steam.  Possibly also featuring a pack that includes Pester I with it?\n\nEdit: Becuz I dun no hao 2 gramarz :/","June 25, 2015","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've tried to stay as equal as possible when playing the game, but keep in mind that I did not have to pay for it and that this fact might have act on my mind.)\n\nHorizon shift is an old- school arcade type game that will definitely give you an eighties or early nineties feeling (you know, when you were raging while wiggling that stick trying to beat the bloody level you had spent all your week money on...)\n\nYou direct a small vessel along a line placed at the center of the screen. You can orientate your ship so it'll face up or down. Of course, you can shoot, and that's lucky since there will be a lot of ennemies that will be coming at you. Each time an ennemy comes in contact with the horizon line you're sitting on, it breaks it partially, making your moves more difficult. Fortunately, you can jump along that line, and you should learn quickly to use that trick because it will allow you to get a little speed boost. And if an ennemy is not trying to destroy your line ? Well, it's probably shooting à you, or dropping bomb...\n\nFar away from a manic shooter, Horizon Shift still gives you a real feeling of challenge across its different levels. Even if it's probably not the best in the "arcade shooter" category, mainly since it stays quite simple (but not easy), especially in the graphic and sound department, if you want a game that will tingle both your nostalgy and challenging nerves, then, at around 5€, it's safe to say you won't feel robbed by Horizon Shift. Maybe you won't play it for long hours in a row, but it's the typical game you'll launch for a few quick rounds when you don't have time for a bigger game.","August 7, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've tried quite a few times, but I've only gotten to the level 27 boss. And while I don't like reviewing a game I haven't beaten, I seem to have hit a wall at level 27. But hopefully, some will still find this helpful.\n\nThe visuals with Horizon Shift are simple, yet clean with an interesting trait. Half of the small enemies and some bosses look like something straight out of a game from the old days of vector graphics. Think Tempest or Space Duel and you'll have a good idea of what they look like. Other enemies and bosses have a distinct Adobe Illustrator look about them, in that they're made up with those same vector graphics, but the lines are fatter, they have a smooth gradient on/in them, or both. It's a very basic design concept, with ships that look more like logos or graphic design symbols, but it's executed pretty well with touches of animation and rotation. The backgrounds are the opposite of the sprites, in that they appear to be polygonal models of a rotating planet, of falling down various kinds of tunnels, a Skeletor/Kaos head that taunts you, and other assorted animated images. They are then under various transparent layers that feature lighting and lightning effects, 3D scrolling blocks, and so forth that creates a multi-layered backdrop to the action. They're also kept rather dark, so despite how busy they can get, they don't interfere with the visibility of the game sprites, or become too distracting.\n\nThe music in the game is an interesting mix of old and new when it comes to instruments. You'll hear synths that sound like they could've come from an NES or a Genesis system, distorted Rock/Metal guitars, distinctly 80s synths, beats that touch upon House and Trance, and it's all mashed together to create an Electronica soundtrack that's enjoyable to listen to as you play. The music also supports the frantic pace that develops as the game progresses, without going ballistic in tempo or having overwhelmingly loud/rapid-fire notes. So in this area, there's nothing to complain about. When it comes to the sound effects, they do their job well. Explosions, pops, clicks and hisses that work with the retro-like visuals are present without being overpowering (save for the bomb effect that's meant to be big). So here too, things are fine.\n\nWith the gameplay, this game mixes gameplay traits from the likes of Galaga, Breakout and shmups like DoDonPachi. You don't fly over landscapes or in outer space. Instead, you stay within the confines of a single screen, moving back and forth along a straight line; the horizon. You can only move along this horizon, be it above or below it. Granted, you can jump (yes, jump) over bullets, enemies and gaps in the horizon thanks to a bit of platformer gameplay infusion. But most of the time, you'll be finding yourself sliding to the left and right along the horizon line, shooting strait up and down at the enemies. And there will be plenty of enemies to shoot at.\n\nEach enemy has its own kind of attack. Blue rockets follow you as they travel down/up, blue asteroids slam into your horizon and break part of it off (which also adds a multiplier for each section that's broken off), red rockets come straight down and then “run” along the horizon if they reach it, geometric shapes appear in swarms that come after you if they reach the edge of the screen, indestructible pods fire lasers that cross the whole screen, several ship-types spin so they fire in random directions... and trust me when I say, there are many more. These all show up in a succession of waves, with each sixth wave resulting in a boss fight.\n\nThe bosses come in different shapes and sizes, including crab and jellyfish-inspired ones, a large spaceship, and a six-sided... thing that splits in half. They also feature attacks that vary from simple and easily avoided, to nearly screen-covering blasts of waves and bullets that require small adjustments to survive. Beat the bosses, and you'll be treated to bonus stages with different layouts where you break blocks for extra points. But the enemies and bosses aren't your only foes. As if that all wasn't enough, the very horizon you move along will eventually fight you, as it begins drifting steadily up and down the screen in later stages. This adds to the game's already frantic and at times chaotic pace by that point in the game. Factor this in with the gradually more crowded waves of enemies, increasingly bullethell-like boss fights, platform jumps and whatnot, and there's a lot going on. But, you're not left helpless in all of this.\n\nYou can flip your ship above and below the horizon, allowing you a greater chance to avoid being hit by ships and the white shots that the horizon stops (the yellow shots pass through it, so beware). There are a several powerups that you can earn throughout the game that seem to drop when you either reach a certain number in your chain counter, reach certain scores, or when you use a bomb and kill a high enough number of enemies on-screen (I'm still not sure what exactly triggers a powerup drop). From extra lives, shot power increases, and shields, to combo multipliers, a mirror image of your ship on the opposite side of the horizon, and speed ups, there are a number of ways available to increase your chances of survival. Add in a screen clearing bomb to use once you've killed enough enemies to fill the meter along the bottom of the screen, and the aforementioned jumping ability, and you've got a nice arsenal at your disposal. Oh, and when you die, you get to keep your shot power ups, which is a nice (and needed) touch.\n\nBut, with all of that positive stuff said, there are a handful of blemishes on this game's otherwise pleasant, stylized face. The first of my issues with the game, is that it simply gets too busy later on. Between all of the enemy types crowding up the screen, the moving horizon, indestructible enemies (which are extremely annoying), varying bullet types, and big lasers that drastically cut down on your mobility when they fire, the game can easily become a frustrating one to play. It's not that it gets hard in a shmup way or a platforming way, it gets hard because you have a lot to try and keep track of as the screen gets increasingly more chaotic, crowded and sectioned off. Another issue for me, was the powerup system. It appears to be completely random, and at times, it can lead to very unfair playthroughs. As an example, I didn't get my first shot powerup until stage 19 on one play through, and that's not a good thing in a game that's part shmup in gameplay. My last big issue is with the sluggish way your ship begins moving from a complete stop if you use a digital pad/keyboard. While you come to a dead stop when using both digital and analog inputs, you gradually start moving up to full speed if you use digital. The analog controls mostly alleviate this if you quickly move the stick fully to the left or right, but with the digital controls, it feels like you're fighting with a dead zone that has no way to be eliminated. And that didn't sit well with me.\n\nSo what can we say about Horizon Shift? Between the positive qualities, and the several modes of play that are available and unlockable, there's plenty to enjoy here. It's an interesting game with a good amount of creativity in its visuals, diversity in its gameplay mechanics, and a nice soundtrack. It's also a game that feels like it's a few tweaks away from hitting its full potential. The slow-to-start digital ship movements and the random powerup system dim some of its shine, and the method of its difficulty increase later on will likely be a detriment to its replay factor for some. Yes, it's a fun game. But I think that perhaps it got a few too many ideas jammed into it for its own good, keeping it from being as fun, accessible and replayable as it could be.\n\nScore- 7.8 / 10","July 12, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, the base for Horizon Shift is an original concept if I have ever seen one! Having dual side defense as a bullet hell theme revolutionizes the possibilities and overall experience with Horizon Shift, and recreates the same adventurous and intuitive experience that you lose after playing through the same style bullet hell game a hundred times.\n\nThe interface is free of bugs and crashes, and there are many small pieces that come together to perfect this already solid concept. Varieties of customizable gamemodes, and solid hardcoded game modes give exceedingly more and more gameplay to experience. Coming from the mindset of a gamer, you can feel many of the classic gamer wishes coming to a full realization with this game, as powerups are rewarding, game progression is solid and smooth, and even the tutorial is made to perfection, allowing a swift and smooth transition into the gameplay that goes steady at first to allow you to get bearings, and progressing into the challenging bullet hell theme we all love and enjoy.\n\nTo finish off this gem is the beautiful music, both engaging and intense, the gameplay goes hand in hand with each style and, in a sense, leads you through the levels. Just like a good soundtrack to a movie, you don't sit in the middle of the scene shouting how great the orchestral score is, but you become immersed and let it flow through the environment.\n\nHowever, unlike a linear story game that comes to an end, Horizon Shift is a give and take experience. You give it your time and become progressively better, and you will have a blast and feel the classic accomplishment that you could feel in an old arcade. Thus goes the same way, that it could last you a few minutes if you don't give the game a chance. I believe that this isn't an experience to survive, it is an experience to merely take advantage of, and for only $5, its more than worth the price.","August 22, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On first impression the game might look simple, but after fighting through a few waves you'll quickly see how this game innovates.  Let's take a look at Horizon Shift in this first impression review.\n\nIt can daunting to look at so let me explain to you how Horizon Shift works.  The game is based on controlling the horizontal line in the middle of the screen.  You can point your ship up or down to shoot at enemies on the top and bottom.  Enemies come in waves and there are boss battles periodically.  Your goal is to survive long enough to pass each wave.  Enemies come quickly and in high variety and they will attempt to disrupt your horizon in different ways.  Some enemies will plant themselves on the horizon and make you move away.  Others will literally blow it up which will mean game over for you.    And of course if your ship comes in to contact with an enemy or their bullets, it's also game over.\n\nShooting and moving between top to bottom has a very slight delay.  And this isn't a technical issue, it's a design choice.  There is no room for error.  If your actions aren't on point you can't fudge your way through a situation.  It can be a bit of a bullet hell, even when you flip between top and bottom so memorization is key.\n\nThis game introduces new elements and it does it right.  The levels, the enemy design, and the art style were very carefully crafted.  It's fun, addicting, and challenging.  At no point will you feel like you had a cheap death.  You death is caused by you making the wrong move at the wrong time.  Levels go by quickly and even when you die, you jump right back in to the action.  So you find yourself addicted to passing levels one by one.  Every attempt is a learning experience and if you are persistent, you will beat those hard levels.  The most challenging levels will require you to memorize enemy patterns especially in the beginning of the wave so you don't get overwhelmed.\n\nThe art style is very basic, but attractive and it ties in to the gameplay.  Color and shape are important motifs because they determined how enemies will disrupt your horizon.  Green enemies will bounce off your horizon making them less lethal.  Red enemies will mount themselves on your horizon and move back and forth.  The blue enemies will blow holes in your horizon.  And the swarm will annihilate your horizon.  This effects the priority of who you will shoot first and which hits you can afford to take.  It's not game over if red and green enemies attack your horizon.  You can still survive until the end of the wave.  You also have a bomb meter on the bottom that fills up from killing enemies.  The bomb is kind of like a panic button, because it will clear all enemies on the screen temporarily.  So you have to strategically save it for the right moment when you can't possible kill all of the enemies.\n\nBoss battles are bullet hell moments that remind me of Ikaruga or Jamestown.  Bosses have distinct patterns that you have to weave yourself through.  I actually found most of the early boss battles to be fairly easy, but fun.\n\nHorizon Shift has a ton of options for variety and replay ability.  There's four different modes to choose from and three unlockable modes.  They all have the same levels, but it effects how you play through them.  You get to restart from the last wave you played from,k which is great for making progress even if your skills aren't top notch.  There's also high challenge options like survival where you get no lives and no checkpoints.  You can also crank up the game speed to twice as fast.   The high variety of modes make it customizable and also easy to pickup but hard to master.  The game also has many options for how you want the music to play out.  And the music is rockin.  It's a perfect soundtrack for a shoot em up like this.\n\nHorizon Shift is the perfect blend of classic shmup but with innovative features.  There's plenty of options for replayability.  And the game is only $5 on Steam.  This is a game that you definitely want to play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/recommended/326120/","tgr1","Kelly Osbourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/","436 products in account","When you look at Flump Studios’ games there’s a clear progression, title to title. From the low price, high value Pester, through to last year’s math-shooter, Super Killer Hornet Resurrection,  it’s plain to see that the one man studio from England is honing its craft. Studio owner, Paul Marrable, seems to have a thing for old school arcade shooters and his latest title Horizon Shift continues his affinity for the genre.\n\nAs with most of Flump’s other games you’ll be in command of a diminutive spaceship, taking down wave after wave of enemies whilst dodging a barrage of oncoming bullets. Like all of Marrable’s games, though, Horizon Shift has its own “hook”  – a little something to make it stand out from the rest of the crowd. This time around your ship is on a rail in the middle of the screen, the “horizon” if you will, but it’s actually not as restrictive as it may sound.\n\nYou can flip over to either side of the rail at any time you like, giving momentary respite from the incoming bullets, but it also doubles the challenge you’ll be facing. Enemies now swarm the screen from both sides meaning you need to be twice as aware of what’s coming for you. It’s a fairly tricky game that has chewed me up and spit me out over and over, but it’s never frustrating because of how cleverly designed your enemies are.\n\nHorizon Shift‘s neon, vector-inspired enemies aren’t your usual mindless drones that thoughtlessly spread across the screen. They’re more clever than that, or  rather, the way in which they work with other enemies is. No single enemy type on its own would provide much of a challenge, but with each having their own abilities, the correct (incorrect?) combination can cause you major headaches.  There’s your bog standard enemy that shoots back at you, turret-like enemies that fire tricky patterns of bullets across the screen, larger swarms of enemies that act as one, and “breakers” that destroy part of your rail, meaning you’ll need to jump over a large hole to reach the other parts.\n\n\nThings can get very hectic, very quickly, so it’s worthwhile to prioritise which enemies to take out first. Breakers and turrets are sure to cause the most problems, so I opted to take them out as soon as I could. Fortunately, there’s some simple power ups to help you, and you also have the ability to blast away every enemy on the screen, at the expense of your combo bar. There’s also a mirror power up which allows you to control a clone of yourself on the other side of the screen  for double the destructive fun! Bosses and mini games also make an appearance now and then, mixing up the gameplay formula a little, in a move I’ve come to expect from Flump.\n\nHorizon Shift is easily the best thing to come out of Flump Studios. It’s a step up from the studios previous games, in all departments. Not only is it the most visually appealing game to come out of the company, it is by far the most challenging and enjoyable. SHMUP fans should eat this up.","June 5, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecoopx/recommended/326120/","thecoopx","TheCoopX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecoopx/","690 products in account","This review comes with a caveat; I haven't beaten it. I've tried quite a few times, but I've only gotten to the level 27 boss. And while I don't like reviewing a game I haven't beaten, I seem to have hit a wall at level 27. But hopefully, some will still find this helpful.\n\nThe visuals with Horizon Shift are simple, yet clean with an interesting trait. Half of the small enemies and some bosses look like something straight out of a game from the old days of vector graphics. Think Tempest or Space Duel and you'll have a good idea of what they look like. Other enemies and bosses have a distinct Adobe Illustrator look about them, in that they're made up with those same vector graphics, but the lines are fatter, they have a smooth gradient on/in them, or both. It's a very basic design concept, with ships that look more like logos or graphic design symbols, but it's executed pretty well with touches of animation and rotation. The backgrounds are the opposite of the sprites, in that they appear to be polygonal models of a rotating planet, of falling down various kinds of tunnels, a Skeletor/Kaos head that taunts you, and other assorted animated images. They are then under various transparent layers that feature lighting and lightning effects, 3D scrolling blocks, and so forth that creates a multi-layered backdrop to the action. They're also kept rather dark, so despite how busy they can get, they don't interfere with the visibility of the game sprites, or become too distracting.\n\nThe music in the game is an interesting mix of old and new when it comes to instruments. You'll hear synths that sound like they could've come from an NES or a Genesis system, distorted Rock/Metal guitars, distinctly 80s synths, beats that touch upon House and Trance, and it's all mashed together to create an Electronica soundtrack that's enjoyable to listen to as you play. The music also supports the frantic pace that develops as the game progresses, without going ballistic in tempo or having overwhelmingly loud/rapid-fire notes. So in this area, there's nothing to complain about. When it comes to the sound effects, they do their job well. Explosions, pops, clicks and hisses that work with the retro-like visuals are present without being overpowering (save for the bomb effect that's meant to be big). So here too, things are fine.\n\nWith the gameplay, this game mixes gameplay traits from the likes of Galaga, Breakout and shmups like DoDonPachi. You don't fly over landscapes or in outer space. Instead, you stay within the confines of a single screen, moving back and forth along a straight line; the horizon. You can only move along this horizon, be it above or below it. Granted, you can jump (yes, jump) over bullets, enemies and gaps in the horizon thanks to a bit of platformer gameplay infusion. But most of the time, you'll be finding yourself sliding to the left and right along the horizon line, shooting strait up and down at the enemies. And there will be plenty of enemies to shoot at.\n\nEach enemy has its own kind of attack. Blue rockets follow you as they travel down/up, blue asteroids slam into your horizon and break part of it off (which also adds a multiplier for each section that's broken off), red rockets come straight down and then “run” along the horizon if they reach it, geometric shapes appear in swarms that come after you if they reach the edge of the screen, indestructible pods fire lasers that cross the whole screen, several ship-types spin so they fire in random directions... and trust me when I say, there are many more. These all show up in a succession of waves, with each sixth wave resulting in a boss fight.\n\nThe bosses come in different shapes and sizes, including crab and jellyfish-inspired ones, a large spaceship, and a six-sided... thing that splits in half. They also feature attacks that vary from simple and easily avoided, to nearly screen-covering blasts of waves and bullets that require small adjustments to survive. Beat the bosses, and you'll be treated to bonus stages with different layouts where you break blocks for extra points. But the enemies and bosses aren't your only foes. As if that all wasn't enough, the very horizon you move along will eventually fight you, as it begins drifting steadily up and down the screen in later stages. This adds to the game's already frantic and at times chaotic pace by that point in the game. Factor this in with the gradually more crowded waves of enemies, increasingly bullethell-like boss fights, platform jumps and whatnot, and there's a lot going on. But, you're not left helpless in all of this.\n\nYou can flip your ship above and below the horizon, allowing you a greater chance to avoid being hit by ships and the white shots that the horizon stops (the yellow shots pass through it, so beware). There are a several powerups that you can earn throughout the game that seem to drop when you either reach a certain number in your chain counter, reach certain scores, or when you use a bomb and kill a high enough number of enemies on-screen (I'm still not sure what exactly triggers a powerup drop). From extra lives, shot power increases, and shields, to combo multipliers, a mirror image of your ship on the opposite side of the horizon, and speed ups, there are a number of ways available to increase your chances of survival. Add in a screen clearing bomb to use once you've killed enough enemies to fill the meter along the bottom of the screen, and the aforementioned jumping ability, and you've got a nice arsenal at your disposal. Oh, and when you die, you get to keep your shot power ups, which is a nice (and needed) touch.\n\nBut, with all of that positive stuff said, there are a handful of blemishes on this game's otherwise pleasant, stylized face. The first of my issues with the game, is that it simply gets too busy later on. Between all of the enemy types crowding up the screen, the moving horizon, indestructible enemies (which are extremely annoying), varying bullet types, and big lasers that drastically cut down on your mobility when they fire, the game can easily become a frustrating one to play. It's not that it gets hard in a shmup way or a platforming way, it gets hard because you have a lot to try and keep track of as the screen gets increasingly more chaotic, crowded and sectioned off. Another issue for me, was the powerup system. It appears to be completely random, and at times, it can lead to very unfair playthroughs. As an example, I didn't get my first shot powerup until stage 19 on one play through, and that's not a good thing in a game that's part shmup in gameplay. My last big issue is with the sluggish way your ship begins moving from a complete stop if you use a digital pad/keyboard. While you come to a dead stop when using both digital and analog inputs, you gradually start moving up to full speed if you use digital. The analog controls mostly alleviate this if you quickly move the stick fully to the left or right, but with the digital controls, it feels like you're fighting with a dead zone that has no way to be eliminated. And that didn't sit well with me.\n\nSo what can we say about Horizon Shift? Between the positive qualities, and the several modes of play that are available and unlockable, there's plenty to enjoy here. It's an interesting game with a good amount of creativity in its visuals, diversity in its gameplay mechanics, and a nice soundtrack. It's also a game that feels like it's a few tweaks away from hitting its full potential. The slow-to-start digital ship movements and the random powerup system dim some of its shine, and the method of its difficulty increase later on will likely be a detriment to its replay factor for some. Yes, it's a fun game. But I think that perhaps it got a few too many ideas jammed into it for its own good, keeping it from being as fun, accessible and replayable as it could be.\n\nScore- 7.8 / 10","July 12, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
