These reward extra defenses and wealth generation that can be spent on ship upgrades. Performance didn't skip a beat, offers a range of settings which should allow it to run on lower end machines, including a toggle for either retro or smoothed pixels effect. One great feature is the level editor, which in time looks like it should tie-in to the steam workshop. Global leaderboards were also available along with a silly amount of difficulty settings. Controls were not able to be remapped but I had no problems with the default setup.\n\nWell worth taking a look at for any shmup/sidescroller fan. Cheers.\nCopy was provided by dev, doesn't change my thoughts.","December 4, 2015","true","5.5"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","33","42","0","0"

It is, but it does everything necessary well and adds a little strategy and management. Overall it's enjoyable.\n\nPros:- Weapon type variety. There are six weapon types each with three modes, you'll usually switch those many times through every single level.\n- Difficulty options. You can change between 10 difficulty options anytime in the main menu.\n- Upgrades (and skill) system.\n- Colonizing. After you beat all levels on a planet (level set), you can start colonize the planet - you can spend your resources on buildings to make them generate income or research new technologies. Also, you have to defend your colonies from attackers (more levels for you - orbit patrols).\n- You can play with mouse, keyboard or gamepad.\n- Level editor and Steam Workshop integration.\n- Low system requirements.\n- SteamOS/Linux support.\n\nCons:- Menu animations are slow.\n- Enemy bullets and missiles are harder to see with many enemies around, you have to be observant.\n- There are barriers between some level sets made to stop your progress in campaign to focus on colonizing instead.","December 27, 2015","true","6.3"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","0"

During missions, you have 3 different attack modes, each with their own strengths. For example, one attack mode fires and has a wide spread, however it cannot deflect missiles like another mode can. Different colored power-ups during gameplay also give you other bonuses, such as regenerating shields or missiles. In between missions, you spend the money you earn on upgrades or developing the planets you have freed from enemy control. There are 7 planets to free with 3 levels each (boss fight on the 3rd) and a difficulty setting you can modify at any time on a 0-10 scale.\n\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPROS & CONS\n\nPros:\nNice mix of bullet hell and RPG mechanics\nDetailed tutorial explaining the game mechanics at the beginning\nAdjustable difficulty setting along with a "hardcore" mode\nVery smooth performance\nKeyboard, mouse, and controller support\n\nCons:\nNot much story involved in the game, apart from the intro\nSometimes enemy projectiles are same color as the background (blue bullets against blue sky) adding artificial difficulty\nLots of grinding to level up and buy upgrades!\nLack of enemy variety\n═══════════════════════════════════\nSUMMARY & FINAL RATING\n\nSolid game for fans of the Shoot em' up genre.

These elements don't get in the way of what's really important - the shooting.\n\nYour color choice affects your weapon type, and then your wing formation affects your bullet focus.  Each color has different pros and cons, and each wing formation suits a different purpose.  Clearing the planets allows you to put a colony down, which can improve research speed and provide a steady income.\n\nSeems the goal is to beat all the levels on the highest difficulty with the highest rank, and that suits me just fine.  I might not spend hours and hours on the game, but if I have a few minutes, it's an option I won't overlook.  It's fun.\n\nI like it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mg979/recommended/387240/","mg979","mg979","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mg979/","407 products in account","I'm half-way through the game and I can say it's rather fun, decent graphics and music, but there are aspects that keep me from recommending it completely. There's too much unnecessary stuff or maybe underdeveloped ideas, in a certain way it reminds me of A Valley Without Wind from this point of view. Especially the colonizing and research parts seem to be there just to waste your time, because you basically have to sit there and wait for buildings or research to be completed, even to progress in the game sometimes. You can do missions in the meantime, but why are they there in the first place if they don't serve any practical purpose, if you can unlock them just by staring at the screen? It's not going to happen anything in the meantime, it's not an RTS.\n\nThere are three firing modes that you can change at any time, but one of them (mode B) seems useless to me, just there to make controls more confusing. The firing modes can also have different colours, that you can change by collecting a special power-up. That would be interesting if not for the fact that some colours are clearly better than others (red and orange being rather bad).\n\nYou can spend skill points gained with experience levels for some upgrades, but the highest tier "improvements" only work if you don't shoot. Can you imagine a shooter where you don't shoot?\n\nSo in the end, this game tries to be more things at once, but some of its aspects are oddly designed, to say the least. If you take it for what it mainly is (a shooter) then game is quite good (and challenging), but I can also say that I expected a bit more. I think what is missing is the cohesiveness of the different parts of the game, and attention to certain details. I understand that the game is still updated so there's hope that some things will be corrected.\n\n6/10\n\n\n1.3.1 UPDATE\n\nSome aspects of the game have gotten a bit better, but there are still some bugs. I wish that there were two distint modes (Arcade without colonizing/research stuff, and Campaign with them), and more standardized difficulty levels. The game is still much less than it could be with some tweaks.","February 11","true","14.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AgreedSA/recommended/387240/","AgreedSA","AgreedSA","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AgreedSA/","694 products in account","This is a really fun, surprisingly deep SHMUP! It features a good collection of levels, a difficulty slider that increases risk and reward for the level (even one bump up is a solid increase in challenge, and good freaking luck on the later difficulty levels if you're not a SHMUP god).\n\nOn top of the basic SHMUP mechanics, which it nails, it has a varied and enjoyable progression system. You buy new parts for your ship in the shop, gated off by your "Core level" (which goes up as you play levels and get powerups). However, you also have to do research to unlock stuff, which is accomplished by means of a "Colonization" mechanic. It's actually fairly deep, and runs in some sorta real time as you're playing, with the time factor increased a lot when you're playing missions.\n\nSo, example, I played a bit and got enough credits to start a colony on one of the worlds I had cleared all three levels for. The pod deploys, and then instead of the planet interface for missions, it switches to a grid-based view where you can use money you've earned in missions to construct buildings. Some of them add population, some add power, and the others allow you to do things like earn passive income or do research. As I've typed this review, with the game running in the background, it's earned enough off of my first colony to build some new buildings - with further development I bet this becomes the way you earn steady cash for upgrades.\n\nI'm still quite early in the game but I've got all the different game mechanics going now and I am really enjoying how they all work together. It's all tied together by the excellent SHMUP gameplay, and none of it would matter as much if that sucked... But it rocks! And the other elements, far from being tacked on or shoehorned in, are well thought out and contribute to a fun sense of progress and mastery. Rewarding, enjoyable game, very glad I purchased it and I recommend it.\n\nUPDATE: Yeah this has just kept getting cooler. I really, really like this game, very glad I bought it. The colonization thing turns out to be really important, which may turn some people into pure SHMUP gameplay off. But the game advertises heavily its "RPG and RTS" elements, and if you are a fan of those genres, the blend of gameplay elements is just extremely rewarding and engrossing. Everything in this game happens in the aforementioned real-time. All three aspects of the gameplay have direct benefits from the research tree. You can research to improve colonization (and doing so first makes the rest go quicker, but you don't have to - I didn't, prefer to get more reward in the SHMUP gameplay and that means researching the two non-colony trees as well). You can research to improve the fighter's power directly. You can research to unlock buyable upgrades that you get by spending currency.\n\nAnd there's more - there's a whole crafting system in the game based on buildings you can put down in your colonies. The two types involved are Factories and Citadels, though I haven't even started building Citadels yet - they seem to be one of the gates to further progress requiring more research. You earn materials either from pickups in stages, or from passive production of items that you can then break down (this happens in the background of the game all the time, though sometimes you might need to defend a colony - I've found them to defend themselves fine with two Defense buildings). Those items, though, are passive upgrades that improve your ship's various characteristics or building capabilities in the colony section.\n\nIt's just really extra deep for a SHMUP game. The progression doesn't feel particularly slow, either, and the difficulty scaling is fantastic. Just starts good and gets better and better, this game. Highly recommended for SHMUP fans who also enjoy base-building elements of RTS games and like having a lot to do in a game for surprisingly little scratch!","April 20","true","55.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

They lied.\n\nThe tutorial was a overly detailed, long, boring. I skipped most of the first tutorial level and just couldn't face another 2.\n\nSo, the first level of the campaign... long, boring, repetitive. I don't know how long it lasted, but it was about 3 or 4 times longer than it should have been. In the end I was just waiting for it to finish. They've taken a genre that should be about fun, reactions, interesting levels, interesting enemies, interesting weapons, and churned out a generic game. So you get differently coloured weapons, all of which fire way too many bullets (it's quasi-bullet storm, really) and it was all a little meh. I would have much preferred to start with a simple weapon and upgrade it, instead of a fancy weapon that fires a lot but does no damage. It just wasn't appealing, at all, for me.\n\nThere's much better out there.","January 16","false","0.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","1"

THIS IS A NOD TO THE GREATEST SHOOTERS EVER CREATED AND this little gem sings her heart out with the a lovesong to all those historical shooters of bygone times.

It feels like they added a bunch of things together to make the game but didn't really make a clean and conhesive way that all these things work together. Even if the overall game seems alright, the missions annoyed me a ton because you pretty much start over at no power ups then do a mission that's five minutes long where you basically max out your power ups by the end but lose it after. The least cool part of a shooting game like this is when you don't have power ups yet they make you live that out every time you start a mission. It's a super bummer.\n\nFull review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTlLHvITx7c","May 17","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"
